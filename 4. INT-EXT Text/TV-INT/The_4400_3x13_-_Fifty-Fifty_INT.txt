      WHAP!  A cardboard storage box lands IN FRAME, next to a
      small pile of similar boxes. 

                                  ALANA (O.S.)
                    Thomas?

      Another angle REVEALS:  TOM, dressed in a t-shirt and
      sweatpants, standing over the little pile of boxes.  ALANA,
      dressed in her nightclothes, is on her way down the stairs --

                                  ALANA (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing?  It's two in
                    the morning. 

                                  TOM
                      I couldn't sleep.
                          (and then; re: boxes)
                    Kyle left this stuff behind.  He
                    wanted me to throw it out.  I figured
                    I'd look through it.  See if there's
                    anything he might want to keep. 
                    You know.  When he comes home.

      A moment.  They both know that's not in Kyle's plans.  But
      Alana can't blame Tom for holding out hope.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Sorry I woke you up.

      She crosses over to him.  Puts a comforting arm around his
      shoulder.  Then turns to the boxes.

                                  ALANA
                    It's okay.  Let me help.

      Alana finishes opening up the box.  On top of its cluttered
      contents, we FIND a picture of Tom and a young Kyle.  As Tom
      picks it up and considers it --


      COLLIER leads DEVON in -- SHAWN, RICHARD, KEVIN, and TESS*
      all stand waiting.  A black curtain has been draped across
      the far wall of the room as a backdrop.  A stool rests in
      front of it, a video camera on a tripod trained on it.

      Devon smiles nervously at everyone as she walks across the
      room.  Collier guides her to the stool.  Shawn approaches --

                                  SHAWN
                    You're positive you want to go
                    through with this?

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    Shawn.  Devon asked for this.  She's*
                    ready.*

      But Shawn keeps his eyes locked with Devon's.  He's offering
      her a way out if she wants one.  But Devon smiles...

                                  DEVON
                    Ever since I first showed up at the
                    Center... this is what I've wanted. 
                    This is why I came.
                          (and then)
                    Besides.  If anything goes wrong,
                    you're here.  Right?

      Shawn NODS, squeezing her hand as he steps away.  Kevin moves 
      over to her, begins placing a blood pressure cuff around her
      arm.  Tess moves over to the camera, begins framing a shot.

                                  KEVIN
                    I'm going to check your vitals one
                    more time. 
                          (to Collier)
                    I'll need about five minutes.

      Collier NODS, steps away.  As Kevin begins to work, Shawn
      locks eyes with Richard.  They hold each other's gaze, both
      overwhelmed by the magnitude of what they're attempting.


      Moments later.  Shawn and Richard stand in this empty dining
      room, in the middle of a quiet but intense conversation.

                                  SHAWN
                    ... I know Devon wants to do this,
                    but doesn't it all seem a little
                    sudden?  Extreme?

                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          3.

                                    RICHARD
                    It does seem big.  I'll grant you
                    that.  But I think big moves are
                    what we need right now.

                                  SHAWN
                    Big?  This is huge.  We're about to
                    make abilities available to anyone
                    who wants them.

                                    RICHARD
                    The technology's here.  The
                      government already has it.  Would
                    you rather that Dennis Ryland alone
                    got to pick and choose how to use
                    it?  What do you think he's planning
                    on doing with those soldiers he's
                    creating?

                                  SHAWN
                    Send them after us.  Probably.

                                    RICHARD
                    And if we fight them off, all he'll
                    do is make more.
                          (and then)
                    This is what Collier says we have
                    to do.  Seems to me, we're either
                    with him all the way... or we're
                    not with him at all.

      Beat.  And then Shawn nods.  This is not the time to waver. 
      And as he and Richard head into the other room, we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      -- Of Devon, seated on the stool against the black backdrop. 
      A small tray is at her side, on which rests a syringe filled
      with a familiar glowing green liquid.  Devon, fighting her
        self-consciousness, speaks directly into CAMERA:

                                  DEVON
                    I'm bringing you a message about a
                    better future.  It's here, now,
                    within our grasp... and soon it
                    will be available to everyone.

      Devon picks up the shot.  Holds it up for the camera to see.

                                  DEVON (CONT'D)
                    This serum contains promicin.

                    Everyone knows what that is; it's
                    the neurotransmitter that gives the
                    4400 their abilities.
                          (and then)
                    With these shots, I'm going to train
                    my body to produce promicin.  I'm
                    going to develop a 4400 ability.
                          (and then)
                    And so can you.  These shots are
                    going to be available.  Everywhere. 
                    Soon.  They're the great equalizer,
                    the key to a new world.  A better
                    one.
                          (and then)
                    My name is Devon McSorley, and I'm
                    doing this of my own free will.

      And with that, Devon turns the syringe toward herself.  As
      it lands home, we PULL BACK to REVEAL we're in --


      The video footage is being broadcast on one of the
        widescreens.  Tom, DIANA, JARVIS, GARRITY, and the gathered
      staff look on, stunned.

                                  JARVIS
                    This video went up on the internet
                    six hours ago.  We've tried to
                    suppress it, but it keeps showing
                    up on new servers.

                                  DIANA
                          (re: Devon)
                    Doesn't that woman work for your
                    nephew?

                                  TOM
                          (nods)
                    An enormous government stockpile of
                    promicin goes missing, and a day
                    later an employee of the 4400 Center
                    shows up on the internet giving
                    herself a shot?  It's like Collier
                    doesn't care if we come for him.

                                    GARRITY
                    Does he really think people are
                    going to inject that stuff into
                    their bodies?

                                  JARVIS
                    They're definitely curious.  This
                    video's been downloaded almost a
                    hundred thousand times already.

                    By the end of the day, it's going
                    to be ten times that.

      They all turn their attention back to widescreen, on which
      the footage of Devon's video is playing on a loop --

                                  TOM
                    Collier might look like some kind
                    of prophet now... but the businessman
                    inside him isn't totally dead.  The
                    man still knows how to create a
                    market for his product.

      And we PUSH IN on the video, as Devon once again holds the
      syringe up for inspection --

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      All business in the lobby comes to a sudden halt as the doors
      fly open.  Tom and Diana lead an NTAC Tactical Team in.

      They move with purpose through the lobby, but their progress
      is stopped when a RECEPTIONIST, flanked by a couple of N.D.
      CENTER SECURITY GUARDS, steps into their path --

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    This is private property.  You can't
                    just barge in here.

                                  TOM
                          (holds up document)
                    We have a warrant to search the
                    premises.  Stand aside.

      No movement.  Just as Tom and Diana are about to lead their
      team past by force, we HEAR --

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (O.S.)
                    It's all right.  Let them through.

      They look up.  Collier stands on the landing in the middle
      of the staircase, smiling down at them benevolently --

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (CONT'D)
                    We've got nothing to hide.


      Tom and Diana sit across from Collier, who appraises them
      calmly.  They're mid-conversation:

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    ... You've already looked all over
                    this place.  I understand you've
                    been searching my other real estate
                    holdings as well.

                                  TOM
                    The ones we know about.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    And you haven't found any promicin. 
                    You're not going to, either.

                    Your employees don't seem to have
                    any trouble finding the stuff.  One
                    of them's on the internet right
                    now, talking about the start of a
                    new era.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    Devon's a brave girl.  I've always
                    admired her courage.
                          (and then)
                    Ever since I've known her, she's
                    aspired to something higher for
                    herself.  I'm not at all surprised
                    she found a way to make it happen. *
                    It's a bold idea.  I wish I'd thought*
                    of it. *
                          (and then)*
                    I'd congratulate her.  If I knew
                    where she was.

      Tom and Diana exchange a look.  They weren't sure what they
      were expecting from this conversation, but it wasn't Collier
      being so... Collier-esque.  Off Collier... it's clear that's*
      all he plans on telling them.  We PRELAP Tom:*

                                  TOM (O.S.)
                    This isn't just a "plan."  It's a
                      revolution.


      BARRY, a young math teacher at the Center school, is at the
      whiteboard.  He's in the midst of explaining a long division
      problem to a small group of students, including MAIA.

                                  BARRY
                    ... Make sure you don't forget about
                    the decimal point.  You just bring
                    it up above the division symbol...

      He stops as the door opens.  He's surprised to see Diana
      standing there.

                                  BARRY (CONT'D)
                    Ms. Skouris.  Can I help you?

                                  DIANA
                    I need my daughter.

      Barry looks over to Maia, who's not happy to be singled out
      in the middle of class.  As she rises from her seat --


      CLOSE ON: footage of Devon's "viral video," which is pulled
      on a flat-screen monitor.

                    I don't understand what's so funny.

      Another angle REVEALS:  RYLAND, sitting behind his desk and
      watching the video unfold with the slightest hint of a smile
      on his face.  ISABELLE stands beside him, confused by Ryland's
      lack of reaction --

                    We should move against Collier now. 
                    We're ready.
                          (and then)
                    How are we supposed to stop the
                    4400 if we just sit back and let
                    everyone have a chance to become
                    one?

                                    RYLAND*
                    If Collier puts that promicin on*
                    the street, he'll be doing our job
                    for us.

      Isabelle's reacting quizzically to that cryptic little comment
      when Ryland continues.

                                  RYLAND (CONT'D)
                    And anyway... are you sure you're
                    so eager to move against him?  I
                      understand you have no love for the
                    man -- but don't you realize that
                    Collier is going to be surrounded
                    by the people you're closest to? 
                    Shawn.  Your father.  Moving against
                    Collier means moving against them. 
                    Are you really ready for that?

      We HOLD ON Isabelle as she considers Ryland's question.  She
      wants Collier badly, but she hadn't thought of that particular
      wrinkle...


      WHAP!  Maia's backpack lands on the couch.  It's just been
      hurtled by an angry Maia, who walks in the door trailed by
      Diana.  They're in the midst of an argument that's been raging
      since Diana pulled her out of class.

                                  MAIA
                    ... I'm not leaving school.  You
                    can't make me.  I like it there.

                                  DIANA
                    Maia.  I told you: the Center's
                    involved in some bad stuff.  You're
                    not safe there.

                                  MAIA
                    I'm not safe anywhere.  At least I
                    was happy there.
                          (and then)
                    But you don't care about that, do
                    you?

                                  DIANA
                    Sweetie.  I do care.  And we'll
                    work something out.  We'll go back
                    to home schooling for a while.

                                  MAIA
                    Home schooling sucks.

      Whoah.  Diana reacts to that -- apparently Maia has been
      learning more than just math at the Center School.

                                  DIANA
                    Excuse me?

      But before Maia can repeat herself, there's a KNOCK.

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)
                    We're not done here, young lady.

      Diana crosses over to the door, and opens it to reveal BEN. 
      She's surprised to see him.  Pleasantly surprised, in spite
      of the less than ideal circumstances.

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)
                    Ben.  You're supposed to be in
                    London.

                                  BEN
                    I didn't go.  This whole "time to
                    think" thing... it's not working
                    for me.  I needed to see you.

                                  DIANA
                    Well... I'm actually kind of in the
                    middle of something --

      SLAM!  Maia pulls the door to her bedroom shut.  Hard.  Diana
      looks to the door, then back to Ben.

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)
                    Guess it's gonna wait.  Come on in.

      He steps in.  They're slightly awkward with each other after
      their first "break."  Ben leans in and kisses her -- she
      returns it, but she's too distracted to put much into it.

                                  BEN
                    Is April still here?

                                  DIANA
                    She left yesterday.  "Stormed out,"
                    I guess you'd say.  She only took
                    about half her stuff.  I've called
                    her a few times.  But no luck.
                          (and then)
                      I wouldn't call me back either.

                                  BEN
                    I'm sorry things are bad with you
                    guys.

                                  DIANA
                    Honestly, I haven't had much time
                    to think about it.  Maia's not
                    talking to me.  Everything's blowing
                    up at work.  I have no idea how all
                    this is going to end.

                                  BEN
                    How about it ends happy?

      She just looks at him, not sure what he means.  Ben takes a
      deep breath... and gets on with what he came here to say.

                                  BEN (CONT'D)
                    I have a job offer in Spain.  It's
                    long.  Six months.  Maybe more. 
                    I'm thinking about taking it.

                                  DIANA
                    ... You're leaving?

                                  BEN
                    Only if you come with me.  You and
                    Maia.

      And now it's Diana's turn to be flabbergasted.  As she reacts --

                                  BEN (CONT'D)
                    Think about it.  You've given*
                      everything you've had to this job
                    for years.  Let someone else take
                    up the cause.  It'll be better for
                    you.  It'll be better for Maia.

                                  DIANA
                    I've thought about leaving.  Finding
                    someplace safe.  It just never seemed
                    possible.

                                  BEN
                    But it is.  You have the option of
                    walking away.  It's important to
                    remember that.

      Diana's allowing herself to think about that when her cell
      phone RINGS.  She checks it --

                                  DIANA
                    It's the office.  I have to take
                    this.

                                  BEN
                    Okay.  But remember... there's always
                    gonna be another call like that.

      A beat as Diana looks at him.  She's surprised to find herself
      actually thinking about his suggestion.  And then she's gone,*
      picking up her cell phone as she heads for the door --*


      MARCO sits at the circular table in the center of the room,
      leaning back in his chair with a satisfied look on his face. 
      As a series of BEEPS are broadcast over his computer's audio
      system, he smiles. 

      Tom and Diana stand near him.  Their brows furrow as they
      listen to the sound.

                                  TOM
                    That's great, Marco.  Cool beeps. 
                    You mind explaining what they are?

      Marco leans forward, pressing a button on his computer to
      stop the broadcast.

                                  MARCO
                    I've been working on the video of
                    Devon McSorley that's making the
                    rounds on the internet.  I isolated
                    the audio, and played up the
                      background noise.
                          (and then)
                    That noise you're hearing?  It's a
                    garbage truck, moving in reverse. 
                    Wherever the tape was made... there
                    was a garbage truck doing its rounds
                    outside.

                                  DIANA
                    Okay.  That'll narrow it down.  A
                    little.  There must be dozens of
                      neighborhoods scheduled for garbage
                      collection last night.

                                  MARCO
                    That's true.  But... wait for it.

      Marco leans forward, pressing a button on his computer.  The
      background audio track resumes.  We HEAR the sound of the
      truck in reverse again, then... quieter, deeper in the
      background, a low, FOGHORN sound.

                                  TOM
                    That sounds like a boat whistle. *

                                  MARCO
                    A ferry whistle, to be exact.

                                  DIANA
                    Okay.  So they're near the water.

                                  MARCO
                      Actually... they're somewhere between
                    Edmonds and Woodway. 
                          (and then; off their
                            looks)
                    I checked it out.  Those are the
                    only blocks near the waterfront
                    with garbage pickups scheduled for
                    last night.

      Tom and Diana exchange a look; that's something to go on. *
      As they turn to leave, Diana gives Marco a squeeze of "thanks"*
      on the shoulder.  Off Marco, watching her go --


      Devon rests on a couch in the center of the room, a blanket
      pulled over her.  Tess sits over, gently caressing her hair.

      It's maternal.

                    Kevin went through the same thing. 
                    You're lucky, actually.  The promicin
                    from Ryland's company is pure. 
                    It'll be easier for you.

                                  DEVON
                    I wonder what ability I'll get?

                                  TESS
                    I'm sure it'll be great.  Now close
                    your eyes, okay?  Rest.

      Devon does just that -- was she ready to fall asleep, or was
      that Tess' ability at work?  We HEAR --

                                  KEVIN (O.S.)
                    How is she?

      Tess turns.  Kevin has just entered the room.

                                  TESS
                    Fine.  I think.  She's tired.

                                  TESS
                    It's not hard for me.  I believed
                    in you all along.  There was a reason
                    we were taken.  A reason they woke
                    you up.

      She looks back to Devon -- who's about to become the tangible
      evidence of that reason.

                                  TESS (CONT'D)
                    It's incredible.  You should be

                    we're hiding like criminals.

                    It won't be like this forever.

      Tess absorbs that hopeful thought... and then her expression
      curdles.  She's noticed something on the couch.

                                  TESS
                    Oh my God.  Kevin!

      On the couch, Devon's body is wracking with spasms.  She
      shoots awake, SCREAMING in agony.  As they rush to her side,
      Devon places her hands to her head. 

      Kevin and Tess try to get her to calm down.  But when she
      pulls her hands away, they see that she's bleeding from her
      nose and eyes.  Tess SCREAMS.  Kevin turns to her --

                                  KEVIN
                    Call Shawn.

      Tess rushes for the phone.  As Kevin tries to care for Devon --


      Tom and Diana are each lost in separate piles of work.  Diana
      looks up from her computer screen --

                                  DIANA
                    This looks promising.

      Tom crosses.  She turns her monitor, which displays a
      satellite image of an urban block.

                    3516 Bay Street.  It's two blocks
                    west of Woodway.  Municipal records
                    indicate it's unoccupied.  And some
                    offshore company pays the property
                    tax. 
                          (and then)

      And as the agents head for the door --THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          16.




      Shawn kneels over the couch, groaning mightily as he exerts
      every effort to save Devon.  Kevin lingers near Shawn, looking
      on with concern.  Tess is over at the window, looking out
      the blinds.  She turns to them --

                                  TESS
                    Kevin.  There's a whole bunch of
                    cars coming. 
                          (and then)
                    They're stopping out front.

                                  KEVIN
                    We have to go.

                                  SHAWN
                    No!

                                  KEVIN
                    -- Shawn.  NTAC is here.  We need
                    to leave.  Now.

      No response; Shawn's lost in his efforts to save Devon. 
      Kevin grabs Tess by the hand, leading her through the back.


      Tom and Diana, weapons drawn, lead the flood of agents. 
      They round the corner into the living room, only to find --

      -- A despondent Shawn, crouched over Devon on the couch.

                                  TOM
                    Shawn.  Step away.  Keep your hands
                    where everyone can see them, okay?

      Shawn looks up at them, his face wounded and confused.

                                  SHAWN
                      I couldn't save her.  She's dead.

      And as NTAC surrounds Shawn and the body --

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Shawn sits on the hot seat, his hands cuffed to the table. 
      Tom and Diana look on as he wonders what happened.

                                  SHAWN
                    ... How could this happen?  Why did
                    Devon die?  It makes no sense. 
                    Ryland's giving that stuff to
                    soldiers and parading them on
                    national TV.

                                  DIANA
                    Her body couldn't handle it.  She
                    had a massive aneurysm.  She was
                    probably brain dead by the time you
                    got there.

                                  TOM
                    Shawn.  I have to be honest with
                    you.  You're in trouble here.  At
                    the very least, you lied to NTAC. *
                    The people I work with, they believe*
                    you're involved in a conspiracy to*
                      distribute promicin.  You need to
                    talk to us.
                          (no response)
                    What were you doing at that safe
                    house?  Who called you?

      Shawn considers the questions for a moment.  Then looks up
      at Tom and Diana, determined to reveal nothing.

                                  SHAWN
                    I'm sorry Devon's dead.  I really
                    am.  But I've got nothing to say.

                                  DIANA
                    Come on, Shawn.  If you ever want
                    to get out of here, you have to
                    tell us where Collier's storing the
                    promicin.

                                  SHAWN
                    What difference does it make?  Even*
                    if he did have plans to distribute*
                    that stuff, I'd say they've changed. 
                      Something's wrong with it.  No way
                    anybody gives it out now.

                                  TOM
                    Are you sure about that?  Collier
                    left the Center.  We have no idea
                    where he is.  He's not exactly
                    flocking to your aid.

                                  SHAWN
                    Stop asking me to talk about Jordan. 
                    He hasn't done anything wrong.

      And Shawn just meets his uncle's gaze, defiant.  Obviously,*
      he's not planning on talking to them --*


      A somber Collier stands in front of the stacks of promicin,
      reacting to the news that Kevin and Tess have just brought
      him.  A crestfallen Richard stands at his side. 

      Behind them, BOYD GELDER stands with PAUL NEWBOLD and TINA
      RICHARDSON, the N.D. MEMBERS OF THE NOVA GROUP released in
      Episode 31, "Terrible Swift Sword."  They all watch Collier
      as he takes a private moment.  Then he looks up --

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    Devon wasn't the first sacrifice
                    the future has asked of us.  She
                    won't be the last, either.  But
                    we'll honor her memory.

                                    RICHARD
                    We can do that later.  NTAC has
                    Shawn.  It's only a matter of time
                    before they get the location of
                    this place from him.  We need to
                    destroy this stuff.  Cut and run.

                                  BOYD
                    Why?  If they want to come... let
                    them come.  That's why you have us
                    here.  Right?

      Collier holds up a placating hand, urging calm.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                      I appreciate your bravery.  But it
                    won't come to that.  Not yet.  I
                    tested Shawn to remind him of his
                      loyalties.  He won't betray us again.

                                    RICHARD
                    His "loyalties" aren't the issue.

21CONTINUED:21

                                    RICHARD (CONT'D)
                    We've seen it before: if the
                      government wants to know something,
                    they'll do whatever takes to get
                    it.  It doesn't matter what Shawn
                    wants; he'll break.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    He'll be tested.  But he'll endure. 
                    Long enough for us to begin
                      distribution.

                                    RICHARD
                    "Begin distribution?"  Why would we
                    want to do that?  This stuff killed
                    Devon.  It's not safe.

                                  KEVIN
                    It's a dosage problem.  It has to
                    be.  The promicin from your daughter
                    is different from what I've been
                    using.  It's too pure.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    So we'll dilute it.  Refine the
                    process as we go.  But we will hand
                    it out.
                          (and then)
                    Richard.  We need some successes. 
                    We need people to develop abilities. 
                    If we stop now, they'll paint us as
                      murderers.

                                    RICHARD
                    If we keep going, we are murderers. 
                    Jordan, this is over.

      Richard looks at the assembled group, gauging his support. 
      He doesn't see any.  In fact, they're all standing at
      Collier's side, between Richard and the promicin.

                                    RICHARD (CONT'D)
                    I'm ending this.  Get out of my
                    way.

      No movement.  Richard looks behind them -- and the vials of
      promicin begin shattering.  He's using his telekinetic ability
      to destroy the stash.  More bottles pop, and the green serum
      begins dripping down the crates and puddling on the floor.

      A tense moment; will Collier tolerate this dissent?  He
      finally looks over to Tess.

                                  TESS
                    Mr. Tyler.  I don't think you should
                    do that.

      Richard looks over to her -- and just like that, the anger
      in his face slackens.  He goes from righteous defiance to
      numb acceptance.  And the POPPING of the vials stops.

                                  TESS (CONT'D)
                    We're all under a lot of strain. 
                    Maybe you should just sit down. 
                    Rest for a while.

      Richard moves over to a nearby chair.  As he sits, Collier
      turns to Boyd and the other Nova members --

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    Clean up this mess.  We need to get
                    it ready to move.


      Diana stacks a couple of dirty dinner plates inside a used
      casserole bowl.  Maia sits at the dinner table, still sullen. 
      After another moment of stacking, Diana looks up --

                                  DIANA
                    You know what?  We can load the
                      dishwasher later.  How 'bout we
                    make some popcorn, watch a movie? 
                    You can pick.

      Maia just looks at her, as if to say: with you?  You must be
      kidding.  She gets up from the table and walks back to her
      room.  Diana watches her go, wanting to say more but figuring
      her daughter needs some time to stew.

      As Maia's bedroom door shuts firmly, Diana turns her attention
      back to stacking the dirty plates.  After a moment of this,
      she hears a key in the door --

      -- And looks up to see APRIL standing there.  April's dressed
      down, much more like the "lost girl" of Season 2.  A beat.

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)
                    ... April.  Hey.

                                  APRIL
                    Hi.  I came by to get my stuff.

                                  DIANA
                    I packed it up for you.  Come on
                    in.

      April ENTERS, walking over to a couple of DUFFEL BAGS that
      are stacked near the couch.  As April bends over to pick one
      up, Diana notices a brand-new SPIDER-WEB TATTOO on April's
      neck.  It's just a piece of a larger tat, which looks like
      it starts somewhere around April's collarbone.

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)
                    Is that new?

                                  APRIL
                          (touches neck)
                    Oh.  Yeah.  Little gift to myself.

                                  DIANA
                    I, uh, like it.

                                  APRIL
                    Di.  Don't pretend, okay?  I did it
                    to remind myself who I am.  I guess
                    I wasn't meant for that whole...
                    settled thing I was going for with
                    Ben.

      Diana nods.  April reaches into her jacket pocket, producing
      a small RING BOX --

                                  APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Here.  I brought you something.

                                  DIANA
                    You're giving me a present?

                                  APRIL
                    Kind of.  It's mom's engagement
                    ring. 

      Diana holds up her hands, refusing to take it --

                                  DIANA
                    April.  I gave that to you. 

                                  APRIL
                    I don't have any use for it.
                          (and then)
                    Besides, I kind of owe you.  Don't
                    get me wrong... I'm still pissed. 
                    But you saved me from trying to be
                    someone I'm not.
                          (and then)*
                    Just don't expect me to come over
                    for Thanksgiving, okay? *

      A beat.  April holds out the ring box.  This time, Diana
      takes it.

                    Thank you.

      April NODS, shouldering one of her duffel bags.  As she stands --

                                  APRIL
                    Tell me one thing.  When Maia
                    predicted you were gonna end up
                    with Ben... did you really fight
                    against it?  As hard as you told me
                    you did?

                                  DIANA
                    I thought so.  I really did.  But
                    to be honest... now I don't know.

      April nods, grateful for the truth.  And as she picks up her
      other bag and turns to go --


      Tom and Diana follow Ryland into his office.  He's carrying
        a briefcase, arriving for the day.  As he crosses behind his
      desk --

                                  RYLAND
                    I'm not surprised that girl died. 
                    This is exactly why we need to get
                    that stuff out of Collier's hands. *

                                  TOM*
                    We need to know about your promicin
                    supply, Dennis.  Your people have
                    been working with it for months. 
                    Have you seen anything like this?

      Ryland sits behind his desk.  He looks calmly up at them --

                                  RYLAND
                    We have had some... casualties among
                    our volunteers.

                                  TOM
                      Casualties?  How many?

                                  RYLAND
                    We recruited 20 volunteers into the
                    program.  Half of them... rejected
                    the promicin within 48 hours of
                    their first dose.

                                  DIANA
                    Rejected.  You mean they died.

                                  RYLAND
                    We knew there were risks involved. 
                    We explained that to the volunteers
                    before they signed on.

      A moment as that lands on Tom and Diana.  They didn't think
      Ryland could surprise them... but he's done it again.

                                  DIANA
                    My God.  You knew.  You knew what
                    would happen if people took this. 
                    Why didn't you tell us when it was
                    stolen?  We could have warned
                    Collier.  The public.

                                  RYLAND
                    Because.  Gods don't make mistakes. 
                    And what better way to show people
                    that Collier's not some kind of
                    messiah than to let him fall on his
                    face in public?

                                  TOM
                    You kept quiet so you could discredit
                    Collier?  A woman is dead, Dennis. 
                    And you're just as responsible as
                    he is.

                                  RYLAND
                    That girl shouldn't have been
                    injecting stolen promicin.  Anyone
                    who follows her lead will have to
                    live with the consequences.  Or
                    not.

      We HOLD ON Ryland as he looks at them, yielding no ground
      whatsoever... and PRELAP Jarvis:

                                  JARVIS (O.S.)
                    Ryland and Collier.  They might be
                    on different sides...


      Jarvis stands near her office, reacting to the news that Tom
      and Diana have just brought her.  Garrity and a couple of
      N.D. AGENTS stand with them.

                                  JARVIS
                    ... But they have more in common
                    than either of them would like to
                    admit.

24CONTINUED:24

                                    GARRITY
                    Yeah.  Like they're both completely
                    out of their minds.

                                  JARVIS
                    So this promicin that Collier's
                      holding... if you take it, you have
                    a fifty per cent chance of dying
                    within 48 hours...

                                  DIANA
                    And a fifty per cent chance of
                      eventually developing some kind of
                    ability.

      A moment as the implications land on everyone.

                                    GARRITY
                    We need to hire more agents.

                                  TOM
                    I don't know.  Fifty-fifty.  Those
                    aren't very good odds.

                                  JARVIS
                    For a chance to become one of the
                    4400... I think there's a lot of
                    people who'd take them.
                          (and then; to Tom)
                    How did your nephew react to the
                    news?

                                  TOM
                    He's still not talking.  He doesn't
                    think there's any way Collier will
                    move ahead with the plan.

                                  JARVIS
                    Tom.  We've been working on him for
                    almost a day.  We need to step up
                    the interrogation a couple notches.

                                  TOM
                    No way.  I'm not standing by while
                    someone tortures Shawn.

                                  JARVIS
                      Actually... that's not exactly what
                    I had in mind.

      And as they all look at Jarvis, wondering what she's planning --THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          25.




      Alana sits at the kitchen island, reacting in dismay to the
      plan Tom has just pitched her.  Mid-conversation:

                                  ALANA
                    ... You want me to help NTAC
                      interrogate Shawn?  I don't think
                    so, Thomas.

                                  TOM
                    Sweetie.  I wouldn't have come to
                    you if I didn't think it was a good
                    idea.
                          (and then)
                    It'll be just like when you helped
                    us with Collier.  You used your
                    ability on him, and when it was
                    over, you had seen the same things
                    he had.  We just need you to tell*
                    us where the promicin is.*

                                  ALANA
                    I know.  But when I agreed to work
                    with NTAC, I told you I'd never do
                    anything to hurt the 4400.

                                  TOM
                    You'd be helping Shawn.  And if you
                    don't do it... NTAC would consider
                    that backing out of your deal. 
                    You'd be a fugitive again.

      No response from Alana.  She's clearly still on the fence --

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Baby.  They'll get the information
                    anyway.  And it'll be a whole lot
                    tougher on Shawn.

      Off Alana, as she takes in Tom's imploring face --*


      BING!  The elevator doors slide open, REVEALING Tom and Alana. 
      In spite of the hesitant look on her face, she's obviously
      agreed to help.

      As they round the corner into OPS, we HEAR heated voices --

                                  JARVIS (O.S.)
                    -- Well how about I call D.C. myself? 
                    Confirm this supposed "order"...THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          26.




      Tom and Alana enter the room, only to find Jarvis, Diana,
      and the others in a standoff with Ryland.  An N.D. ARMY*
      COLONEL stands beside Ryland.  They're backed by a few NSA*
      OPERATIVES and three YOUNG MEN IN MILITARY FATIGUES.  Tom
      stops short at the sight of Ryland, who's in the middle of
      an argument with Jarvis --

                                  RYLAND
                    Go right ahead, Nina.  You'll find
                    out just how little authority you
                    have.

                                  TOM
                    What's he doing here?

                                  RYLAND
                    The U.S. military is taking over*
                    the interrogation of Shawn Farrell. *
                    I'm here as a "consultant."*

                                  DIANA
                    The hell you are.

                                  TOM
                    We'll be done with Shawn in minutes. 
                    Alana can get all the information
                    we need.  Quickly.  And painlessly.

                                  RYLAND
                    You expect us to trust that woman? *
                    We've got it from here, Tom.  We*
                    have confidence in our interrogator.*


      Shawn, exhausted and still cuffed to the table, looks up as
      the door opens --

      -- And Isabelle walks into the room.  She considers him for
      a moment, then shuts the door and crosses to the table. 
      Shawn looks at her in surprise as she takes a seat on the
      other side of the table.

                                  ISABELLE
                    Hi, Shawn.

      Off Shawn, realizing he's about to be put to the test by his
      former fiancee --

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                      END OF ACT TWOTHE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          27.



                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Moments later.  Isabelle sits opposite Shawn, enjoying his
      surprise and discomfort.

                                  ISABELLE
                    We can do this quickly, you know. 
                    Just tell me where Collier's keeping
                    the promicin.

      No response.  Isabelle stands, and walks over to Shawn's
      side of the table.  She reaches out, as though to caress his
      head with a lover's gesture.  Shawn pulls his head back.

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    Are you scared?

                                  SHAWN
                    I'm curious.  The whole time we
                    were planning our wedding, you were
                    working with Ryland.  Betraying me. 
                    Your father.  Why?

                                  ISABELLE
                    Honestly?  It was a balance of power
                    thing.  I was sent back to eliminate
                    the 4400.  I didn't really want to
                    do that.  I loved you, Shawn.
                          (and then)
                    But I had to do something.  So I
                    thought if I hooked up with Ryland...
                    helped his side learn how to create
                      abilities... there'd be a standoff. 
                    If everyone has the technology, no
                    one can use it.  Like the Cold War.

                                  SHAWN
                    Did you really believe that? 
                    Ryland's going to use those soldiers
                    to kill us all.

                                  ISABELLE
                    Not if I don't let him.

      Beat as Shawn absorbs Isabelle's rationale.  He decides to
      test how much of the girl he loved is left in there --

                                  SHAWN
                    So how about now?  Are you still
                      determined not to hurt us?

                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          28.

29CONTINUED:29

      Isabelle stands over Shawn.  She puts a hand to the side of
      his head, trying to convince him how serious she is.

                                  ISABELLE
                    I'd rather not.  But whatever I
                    have to do to keep Collier from
                    going through with his plan... I'll
                    do it.

      She runs her fingers through his hair.  It's an odd -- and
      frightening -- combination of menace and affection.

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    Baby.  Please.  Where's the promicin?

      Shawn turns his head away from her, defiant.  Isabelle's
      expression darkens, and now she puts both hands to the side
      of his head.  Shawn's body TIGHTENS as all his muscles clench
      at once.  And as he CRIES OUT in agony --


      CLOSE ON: a TV in the rear of Ops, which is broadcasting
      security camera footage of Isabelle's interrogation.  As
      Shawn SCREAMS, the footage fritzes out.

      Another angle REVEALS: the agents from NTAC, along with
      Ryland's team, all watching the TV as the screen turns to
      snow.  Tom exchanges a quick look with Alana, then turns and
      dashes toward the rear of Ops.  Ryland calls after him --

                                  RYLAND
                      I wouldn't disturb her right now,
                    Tom.

      But Tom keeps moving.  Two NSA agents step in his path,
      reaching to restrain.  Tom SHOVES one of them with all his
      strength, sending him careening against a work station.  He
      holds a cautioning hand up in the other one's face --

                                  TOM
                    Don't touch me.

      The NSA agent maintains an eyelock with Tom, reaching within
      his jacket, presumably for his sidearm.  We HEAR --

                                  DIANA (O.S.)
                    Don't be stupid.

      They turn.  Diana stands ten or so feet away, her hand within
      her jacket.  Garrity and the other agents also have their
      hands near their weapons.  A tense moment; is this actually
      going to get out of hand?

      Ryland looks over to Jarvis, as if to say: you're going to
      let this happen?  But Jarvis does nothing to defuse the*
      situation, backing her team.  A final beat, and we HEAR --

                                  ISABELLE (O.S.)
                    What are you guys doing?

      They all turn.  Isabelle stands at the rear of Ops, just as
      calm as can be.

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    I'm done.

                                  RYLAND
                    You have everything we need?

      She nods.  And then, ignoring Tom and the rest of the NTAC
      team, Ryland, Isabelle and their retinue turn and file out. 
      As Tom and the others dash for the interrogation room --


      Tom rushes in, Diana and the others just behind him.  Shawn
      is slumped over on the interrogation table, unconscious.

                                  TOM
                    Shawn!

      Diana moves in, checking Shawn's wrist for a pulse with a 
      practiced hand.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Is he alive?

                                  DIANA
                          (nods)
                    His pulse is weak.  We need a medical
                    team in here now.

      And as Tom bolts out of the room --


      Richard sits in a chair in the center of this empty office. 
      Tess sits on the manager's desk, keeping an eye on him as
      she chatters to pass the time.

                                  TESS
                    ... Newfield's such a nice little
                    town.  When this is over, Kevin's
                    gonna retire.  We're gonna go back
                    there to live.  It'll be nice.

                                    RICHARD
                    That's never going to happen.  If
                    people start dying from this
                    promicin, they are going to hunt us
                    down.  There will be no place to
                    hide.  Can't you see that?

      The door opens and Collier ENTERS.  He walks over to Richard,
      kneeling beside him so he can look him in the eye.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    We're going to be leaving soon. 
                    I'd really rather Tess didn't have
                    to compel your cooperation.  If
                    you'll give me your word that you're
                    aboard, I'll tell her she can go.

                                    RICHARD
                    I can't do that.  I'm not a murderer. 
                    I won't let you turn me into one.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    Richard.  Do you really think I
                    want people to die?  Do you honestly
                    believe that's part of my plan?
                          (no response; and*
                            then)
                    We're not going to force this on*
                    anybody.  We'll make people aware
                    of the risks.  It will be their
                    choice.  That's all we're doing. 
                    Giving people a choice.

                                    RICHARD
                    No one's gonna take it.

      Richard's surprised when Collier smiles, confident and serene.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    Do you know how much unhappiness is
                    out there?  How many people are
                    trapped in dead-end lives?  These
                    shots give them a chance to be
                      extraordinary.  There will be demand.

                                    RICHARD
                    And that's who you think we should
                    be giving these abilities to?  The
                    unhappy?  The lost?

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    They say the meek shall inherit the
                    earth.  I guess I just have more
                    faith in humanity than you do.

                                    RICHARD
                    How can you be so calm?  Shawn's
                    probably already given up this
                    location.  And it won't just be
                    NTAC coming.  It'll be Ryland.  My
                    daughter.  Or did you forget they're
                    working together?

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                      I haven't.  We'll be ready for them. 
                          (and then)
                    Now stand up.  It's time.

      Collier NODS back to Tess.  She RISES, walking over to Richard --


      CLOSE ON: Shawn, who lays in a bed with his eyes shut.  His*
      skin is pale, and he's intubated to help him breathe.*

                                  DIANA (O.S.)*
                    He's stable.  That's the good news.*

      PULL BACK to REVEAL: Diana, who stands over his bed, her*
      cell phone pressed to her ear.*

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)*
                    But he hasn't regained consciousness*
                    yet.  They don't know when he will. *
                    There's no precedent for this.*

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH*


      Tom's kneeling at the closet doorway, his phone to his ear. *
      As he reacts to the news Diana's just given him.  Alana looks*
      on.*

                                  DIANA*
                    Tom?  You there?*

                    Yeah.  I'm here.*
                          (and then)*
                    It never ends, does it?*

                                  DIANA*
                    I know.  I've been thinking about*
                    that lately.*

                                  TOM*
                    What do you mean?*

                                  DIANA*
                    Nothing.  Nothing we can talk about*
                    now, anyway.  I'll see you soon,*
                    Tom.*

      Tom hangs up, fiddling with the safe within the closet.  As*
      soon as the call's over, Alana implores him.  They're picking*
      up a conversation they'd been having earlier.*

                                  ALANA
                    ... Thomas.  You can't go up against
                    Isabelle.  It's suicide.

                                  TOM*
                    I have to do it.  She has to be
                    stopped.  Shawn was her fiancee. 
                    If she's willing to leave him...
                    like that, she's willing to do
                    anything.

                                  ALANA
                    But why does it have to be you? 
                    Why does it always have to be you?

      Having opened the safe, Tom pulls out the syringe case, last
      seen in Episode 25, "Graduation Day."  As he opens it,
      REVEALING the nasty-looking shot within --

                                  TOM
                    The future trusted me to stop her. 
                    And they gave me a way to do it.

                                  ALANA
                    You'll never get close enough.  Do
                    you really think she'll let you
                    walk up to her and use that thing?

                                  TOM
                    Look -- they wouldn't have given
                    this to me if they didn't think I
                    had a chance.
                          (and then)
                    Baby.  I have to go.

      Alana just looks at him for a moment... and then pulls him
      into an embrace.  Tom returns it, both of them realizing
      that this could be the last time they see each other.


      The same classroom we saw in Act One.  Barry, the teacher,
      sits at his desk, looking on as the kids work through an
      equation in their notebooks.

      They all look up as the door opens.  Maia walks in, carrying
      her backpack.

                                  MAIA
                    I'm sorry I'm late.  Is it okay if
                    I sit down?

                                  BARRY
                    Maia.  I thought you were going to
                    be away from school for a while.

                                  MAIA
                    I didn't want to fall behind.  I
                    think that would be a bad idea. 
                    Don't you?

                                  BARRY
                    Uh.  Sure.  Take a seat.  We're in
                    page 37 of your workbook.

      And Maia takes a seat next to her friend AMY and pulls her
      workbook out, content that she's right to disobey her mother -- 


      Collier, his back to us, stands in front of the stacks of
      promicin.  There's no one else visible in the hanger.  Collier
      runs his hand along one of the pallets, perhaps contemplating
      the future this substance is going to bring.

      SCREECH!  Behind him, we HEAR the sound of the hangar's metal
      doors being forced open.  Collier turns --

      Isabelle, flanked by five men in military uniforms, strides
      into the hangar.  The men look cautious, not sure what to
      expect in here.  But Isabelle strides boldly up to Collier. 
      He doesn't seem surprised to see her.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    Hello, Isabelle.

                                  ISABELLE
                    That stuff you're standing in front
                    of is mine.  It came from me.  And
                    I'm taking it back.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER
                    It won't change anything.  You can't
                    stop what I've begun.

                                  ISABELLE
                    You know... you're banking a lot on
                    the idea that I can't hurt you.  I
                    just don't think that's true.

      Isabelle holds out a hand -- and Collier's breath is cut
      off.  He puts his hands to his neck, gasping and trying to
      get air in.  But it's no good.  He collapses on the concrete.

      The soldiers move to the stacks as Isabelle continues her*
      torment of Collier.  One of them grabs a vial.  He peels
      open a chemical test strip and dips it into the vial.

      The soldier removes the strip -- and his face falls. 

                                    SOLDIER
                    This is no good.  There's no promicin
                    in the substance at all.

      As Isabelle reacts, the soldiers dig through the stacks of
      promicin, hoping they haven't been duped.  As one of them
      throws a tarp back, we HEAR laughter.  She looks to the floor --

      -- And instead of Collier, we see that the man she's torturing
      is Boyd Gelder.  He's been posing as Collier throughout the
      entire scene.  He struggles to get a bit of breath in.

                                  BOYD
                    I have a message from Jordan Collier. 
                    It's a new world.  And there's no
                    place for you in it.

      And that's all he can get out.  As Boyd continues choking
      and sputtering, the soldier calls out --

                                    SOLDIER
                    Ms. Tyler.  We need to get out of
                    here.  Now!

      WHAT HE SEES: the inside of the promicin stacks is heavily
      laden with plastic explosives.  A DETONATOR is connected to
      one clump of C4.  And as it turns from green to red --


      The front doors open, and Isabelle strides in.  She draws
      stares from the various ACOLYTES and EMPLOYEES, all of whom
      remember her and are well aware of her power.

      Everyone clears a path for her as she moves through the lobby,
      approaching the front desk.  She walks up to the nervous
        receptionist --

                                  ISABELLE
                    Is the school in session today?

      The receptionist can only manage a small nod.

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    Good.  I'll start there.

      Isabelle heads off into the building, the receptionist
      watching her as she goes.  When she's sure Isabelle won't be
      turning back, the receptionist picks up a phone and begins
      to dial.


      The rear storage area of this moving SUV is piled high with
      green canvas bags.  Must be more promicin for distribution. 
      We hear a RINGING PHONE.

      Another angle REVEALS: Richard, who sits in the back seat. 
      Kevin drives and Tess sits shotgun, keeping an eye on Richard. 
      Richard looks down at his ringing phone, sees the caller ID --

                                    RICHARD
                    It's the Center.  You've got to let
                    me pick it up.

      But Tess isn't willing to release her hold on him.  She
      reaches back and plucks the phone out of his lap, answering.

                                  TESS
                    Richard Tyler's line.

                    now.  Can I take a message?
                          (listens; her face
                            falls)
                    Oh.  All right, I'll tell him. 
                    Thank you very much.

      She hangs up.  And turns to Richard, ashen --

                    They think she's going to kill
                    people.


      We're MOVING DOWN this school hallway.  As we do, we take in*
      the crumpled form of Barry, the math teacher.  His back is*
      to us, so we never see his full form.  We PASS the body,*
      approaching an open doorway.*


      Isabelle sits cross-legged on the teacher's desk.  She's*
      looking out at the room full of terrified kids, which includes
      Maia and Amy.

                                  ISABELLE
                    So... who wants to go next?  Any
                      volunteers?

      No response.  The kids shrink back in their seats.

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  I'll pick.

      Isabelle stands, walking along the front row of desks.  Each
      kid turns their head away as she considers them.  She finally
      stops in front of Amy.

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    What's your name?

                                  AMY
                          (very small voice)
                    ... Amy ...

                                  ISABELLE
                    All right, Amy.  Just try to hold
                    still, okay?  This is gonna be quick.

      And as Amy whimpers in anticipation of what's to come, Maia
      suddenly raises her hand.  As if to volunteer.  Isabelle
      moves over to her desk, intrigued by this show of bravery. 
      She looks down at her.

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    You want to take her place?

                                  MAIA
                    No.  I just want to tell you
                      something.


                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400     "Fifty-Fifty"      (SHOOTING SCRIPT)       07/11/06          41.

43CONTINUED:43

      Isabelle just looks down at her, as if to say: what?   Maia
      doesn't shrink from her gaze.

                                  MAIA (CONT'D)
                    What you're trying?  It's not going
                    to work.

      Isabelle reacts to that, then sees that Maia's gaze is fixed
      somewhere over her shoulder.  She wheels to see --

      -- Diana standing in the doorway, her gun pointed right at
      Isabelle.  In the split second before Isabelle can react,
      Diana pulls the trigger.  And empties her clip into Isabelle.

      The kids SCREAM.  Isabelle hits the ground, the result of
      the bullets' impact.  Tom, the syringe in his hand, rushes
      into the room.  As he makes his way to Isabelle, he calls
      out to the kids --

                                  TOM
                    Everyone get out of here.

      He doesn't need to tell them twice.  As the panicked kids
      flee the room, Tom straddles Isabelle and raises the syringe. 
      Just as he's about to bring it down --

      Isabelle's eyes pop open.  She grabs his arm, interrupting
      its downward arc.

                                  ISABELLE
                    You shouldn't have done that.

      With her other hand, she reaches out and shoves Tom in the
      chest with all her strength.  He hurtles backward, losing
      his grip on the syringe.  Isabelle stands as Diana tries to
      reload her weapon.

      With a glance at Diana, Isabelle sends the gun flying in one
      direction, Diana in the other.  Isabelle moves over to Tom,
      who's prone near the desk, reaching his hand out for the
      syringe, which is just out of reach.

      As Isabelle is raising her hand over Tom, we HEAR --

                                    RICHARD (O.S.)
                    Isabelle.

      She turns.  Richard stands in the doorway.  A moment as she
      looks at him.  He doesn't seem to be trying to move against
      her, and is clearly at her mercy.  Can she kill her father?

                                  ISABELLE
                    What?

43CONTINUED: (2)43

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    You're going to tell me to stop? 
                    It's still not too late to save me?

                                    RICHARD
                    It's past that.  You made your
                    choice.  But you're my daughter. 
                    And if you quit all this right now...
                    I'll stand by you.

      She looks at him, her last unsullied human connection. 
      There's a part of her that would like to take the offer. 
      But then her expression darkens --

                                  ISABELLE
                    No.  I'm sorry, daddy.  But this is
                    the way it's supposed to be.

      And she turns back to Tom, who's still reaching out for the
      syringe.  Tom's breath catches as she begins to finish him
      off.  Richard look over to the syringe --

      -- Which rises from the ground, under the control of Richard's
      ability.  It hurtles  straight into Isabelle's neck.  She
      turns to her dad, realizing what he's just done.

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    Daddy?

      She raises a hand up to pull out the syringe... but it's too
      late.  The plunger depresses, as if by its own hand.  And
      Isabelle GASPS as the milky white substance makes its way
      into her body...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      Moments later.  Isabelle pulls the syringe out of her neck,
      looking at her father in shock.  Suddenly, her hand opens
      and the syringe drops to the ground.  She begins to CONVULSE,
      falling to her knees.

      Richard moves to her side as the convulsions worsen, cradling
      her.  Isabelle's body TENSES and she CRIES out in pain...
      then her muscles slacken, and she relaxes in Richard's arms.

      Richard looks at her sadly.  He couldn't save his daughter,
      and his heart is breaking.

                                    RICHARD
                    I'm sorry, Isabelle.

      And as if in response to his words, Isabelle opens her eyes. 
      There's no trace of pain there; just the fury she's worn
      since she walked into the Center.  Is it possible the syringe
      had no effect?

                                  ISABELLE
                    I wish you hadn't done that, daddy.

      She rises to her feet.  Richard does likewise, knowing that
      this is probably the end for him.

                                    RICHARD
                    Isabelle, please --

                                  ISABELLE
                    Don't bother.

      She raises her hand to Richard, her grim expression telling
      us she's ready to follow this through --

      -- Except nothing happens.  It's hard to say which one of
      them is more surprised.  Isabelle looks at her hand, then
      raises it to Richard again.  Still no effect.  She looks to
      her hand again --

                                  ISABELLE (CONT'D)
                    What's the matter with me?

      She tries once more.  Nothing.  Looks like the syringe did
      have an effect -- just not the one we expected.  As it dawns
      on us that Isabelle has been stripped of her abilities, Tom
      and Diana stagger to their feet in b.g.

      Tom unholsters his gun, training it on Isabelle and walking
      towards her. 

                                  DIANA
                    What are you doing, Tom?

                                  TOM
                    What they told me to do.  What I
                    have to do.

                                    RICHARD
                    Hold on.  Her abilities... they're
                    gone.  The girl's helpless.

                                  TOM
                    For now.  How do we know it's not
                      temporary?  Maybe that shot gave us
                    a window of opportunity.

                                    RICHARD
                    No.  There has to be another way.

      Isabelle looks over to Tom, who's very close to her with
      that gun now.  She looks around the room, taking in her
      handiwork.  Then she looks over to her dad.

                                  ISABELLE
                    There isn't.  Leave him alone, daddy.
                          (and then; to Tom)
                    Go ahead.  Finish it.

      Isabelle looks Tom right in the eye.  She looks scared, but
      there's still a hint of defiance.  Tom takes a baby step
      closer.  And we PUSH IN on his conflicted face as he looks
      at this helpless twenty year old --

      BANG!  We're still TIGHT ON Tom's face as the sound of a
      GUNSHOT rings out.


      Tom sits in a chair at the end of this corridor, looking
      forlorn.  We linger with him for a moment, thinking that
      he's reconciling himself to becoming a killer.  Then we HEAR:

                                  DIANA (O.S.)
                      Isabelle's out of surgery.

      Tom looks up.  Diana's standing over his chair.

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)
                    She'll be in recovery for a good
                    while.

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)
                    But they expect her to make it.
                          (Tom nods; and then)
                    For a minute there, I really thought
                    you were going to put one in her
                    head.

                                  TOM
                    So did I.

      She sits down in the chair next to him.*

                                  DIANA
                    The shoulder wound was a good idea. 
                    It let us figure out whether or not
                    the effects of that syringe were
                      permanent.  If she had started to
                    heal herself...

                                  TOM
                    ... I had five more bullets in my
                    clip.
                          (and then)
                    So were they?  Permanent?

                                  DIANA
                    According to Dr. Anapurn, it looks
                    that way.  She's got no trace of
                    promicin in her system.  She's
                    just... a normal girl.

                                  JARVIS (O.S.)
                    A normal girl who's in a lot of
                    trouble.

      They both look up.  Jarvis has approached.  She looks at
      them both with concerned affection, takes in their exhaustion.

                                  JARVIS (CONT'D)
                    You're both okay?
                          (when they nod)
                    Good.  'Cause you're gonna have to*
                    rest up on the fly.  Collier's still*
                    in the wind.  So's his stash of
                    promicin.
                          (as they react)
                    The world's about to change.  And
                    our jobs just got a whole lot more
                      difficult.

      A final moment between them all, then Jarvis turns and walks
      away.  Tom looks over to Diana --*

                    The truth?  I don't think so.*

      Tom looks at her, surprised by her answer.  Diana doesn't*
      say anything further, and Tom doesn't press her. *

      FADE TO BLACK.  And in the moment of darkness that follows,
      a TITLE CARD tells us it's now: THREE DAYS LATER.


      Shawn rests in a bed at NTAC Medical, hooked up to various
      monitors and I.V.s.  His eyes are shut; he's recuperating. *
      Tom sits at his bedside, keeping vigil over his nephew.*

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (V.O.)
                    It hurts to see those costs, but we
                    can't allow them to sway us.

      CAMERA drifts off Shawn, passing through the wall of his
      suite and into the next recovery room.  We FIND Isabelle, in
      a similar situation.  How strange that, after all this, they
      wound up close to each other after all.


      CLOSE ON: KYLE BALDWIN.  The shades are drawn, and he sits
      in this darkened hotel room with an intense expression on
      his face.  It's as though he's about make a difficult choice.

                                  JORDAN COLLIER (V.O.)
                    We move forward... always forward,
                    and into what's next.

      Another angle REVEALS: Kyle is staring at a promicin shot,
      which rests on the table.  And as he picks it up...*
