      TONYA PEREZ (29) tough, attractive Dominican woman exits a 
      rundown private house carrying plastic sheathed dry cleaning.

    She trudges uphill to a street crowned with el train tracks.


    RAY (LAZARUS) BRIGHTMAN(35), some hard miles on his face but 
      athletic, carrying a similar bundle of dry cleaning, heads to 
      a subway station.


        BASIR(KITERUNNER) KHAN (23), Afghani-born, trim, wired, 
      unsmiling, walking along Indo-PakRoosevelt Ave. He too 
      carries dry cleaning. Climbs the stairs to an el station.


      JAYSON(THE FRANCHISE) TONEY(27), ex-NBApoint guard, tall, 
      muscular, carries his load of dry cleaning past a housing 
      project to the nearest subway station.


    All 12 dry cleaning carriers walk in a loose group, too 
      anxious to speak, eyes straight ahead, riveted by the sight 
      of...


      (Covers Upper West Side north to South Harlem.) It s a bunker-
      like concrete fortress built in the Lindsay era; pure siege 
      mentality.


    See the day tour exodus from the muster room, cops heading to 
      their posts.

    As our six rookies blink into the sunlight of their first 
      day...

                                  YODA (O.S.)
                    Get in.

      They turn and see their new FTObeckoning from the driver s 
      seat of an NYPD van.


      White House and Franchise exiting on a somewhat rundown 
      stretch; corner stores, old walk ups and a playground. Older 
      people stare at them from stoops, teenagers (GCG) from the 
      playground benches. Clueless, the two rookies stare back.


    We see Tonya and Lazarus exit onto Footpost42. Tenements and 
      corner stores.

      A cappuccino shop and a yoga studio mark the newcomers. They 
    get the same blank stares.

      TONYA AND LAZARUS  POV   Two blocks straight south down 6th 
      Avenue, White House and Franchise stare back at them.


      Kenny and Kiterunner exiting onto Footpost43.

      Walk ups, corner stores, two funeral homes and a gourmet food 
      shop.

      KENNY AND KITERUNNER S POV   2 blocks south, Tonya and 
      Lazarus stare back at them.

      ACROSS THE STREET   A dozen teenagers (40 WOLVES) hang in 
      front of a row of run-down walkups, eyeballing the rookies.


      White House and Franchise.

      Another NYPD van pulls up, Terry Howard and the Gang Intel 
      Unit, 5 young male plainclothes cops exit.                                                                                    14.

                    Come meet some of your 
                    constituents.

      White House and Franchise walk with them across to the 
      playground, to the dozen or so Gun Clappin Goons hanging 
      there expressionless. They re all wearing Polo and Yankee 
      caps.

                                  TERRY (CONT D)
                    Hey fellas, no school today?

                    Teacher enrichment day.

      White House and Franchise watch as the unit members start 
      finding and picking up orthopedic canes, hammers, bats and 
      rebar pipes, hidden nearly in plain sight around the benches 
    as other unit members start collecting IDsand passing them 
    to a unit member who takes them back to the van to run these 
      kids for outstanding warrants.

                    Travis? He got shot.

      ANGLE   WHITE HOUSE, extracting a doorknob with a sharpened 
      bolt at its opposite end from the backpack.

      ANGLE   FRANCHISE, imitating gang intelcops, removing deadly

                          (entre nous)
                    The whole thing out here, is we got 
                    maybe two dozen sets all hatin on 
                    each other. Right now we just want 
                    to stop these two from goin to war 
                    long enough for them to forget and 
                    get into it with somebody else. 
                    Then we do the same thing with 
                    those two. It s called the mobile 
                    scarecrow.

                                  UNIT MEMBER
                    It s called sweeping leaves on a 
                    windy day.

                    Damn, that new blonde bitch is 
                    mine.

      This is said to White House s back. She stops in her tracks.

                                  WHITE HOUSE
                    Excuse me.

    She turns around and calmly walks back to the bench where 
      they re all eyeing her like candy.

      Franchise moves to back her up but Terry stops him. She s got 
    to deal on her own.                                                                                    16.


      White House gestures to the kid who called her out, as she 
      walks a little away from the others.

                                  WHITE HOUSE (CONT D)
                    Can I talk to you for a sec?
                          (grinning, the kid comes 
                          to her)
                    What s your name?

                                  GCG
                    Roland, baby, what s yours...

      CLOSE ON   WHITE HOUSE taking Roland s hand and discretely 
      putting it into a minute but agonizing wristlock.

                                  WHITE HOUSE
                          (sotto voce)
                    Listen to me, fuzz nuts, you treat 
                    me with respect and I won t make 
                    your life a living hell out here, 
                    how s that sound?

    The kid nods, a teardrop of pain exiting his frozen stare.


      Tonya and Lazarus.

                                  TONYA
                    Ray Brightman. I used to read your

                                  LAZARUS
                    That there, is called a left-handed 
                      compliment.

                                  TONYA

                    But a cop?

                                  LAZARUS
                    Why not? Besides after 14 years on 
                    the street half the time I had 
                    better informants than the 
                    detectives I was writing about. 

                                  TONYA
                          (musing)
                    Lazarus. You wrote about my family 
                    once.

                                  LAZARUS
                    I did, no offence, but they were 
                    some serious thugs, sorry.

                                  TONYA
                    Sorry my ass. That s why I became a

      Kenny and Kiterunner.

    The promised traffic snarl is building up, the traffic agents 
      moving into place to keep things moving.

      A patrol car rolls up, two vets, Martini and Moore.                                                                                    18.

                    We walked to Pakistan, flew to 
                    London a year later, then a few 
                    years after that came to New York.

                                  MARTINI
                    Huh. Wow.

                                  MOORE
                    You ever see any Taliban?

                                  KITERUNNER
                    More than enough.

                    the other side; you know why? 
                    Because if we stayed we d be 
                    killed. Does that sound like I m

      Kenny and Kiterunner.

    As the rookies watch, the detoured traffic is getting out of 
      hand, traffic agents overwhelmed.

      There s almost a fender bender between a Hummer and a yellow 
    cab as the two vehicles charge the same opening.

                                  HUMMER DRIVER (29)
                          (to Pakistani cab driver)

                    alternate feed, you camel riding 
                    hump!

    The cab driver comes flying out, livid, and bearing a tire-
      iron.

                                  TAXI DRIVER (51)
                    I am here ten years, you asshole! 
                    How about I kick you fake Rambo
                    ass!

    The Hummer driver jumps out with a steering wheel lock.

                    Brother, I hope you re gonnause 
                    that to fix a flat.

    The cabbie is stunned to hear a cop speak to him in his 
      native tongue.

                    Let him [Hummer] go first, get some 
                    distance.

    The Pakistani driver, chilled out now, examines Kiterunner s 
      uniform then smiling, pats his badge.

                    menacing, parading without a

    The smallest kid there, T-REX(13), pipes up.

      Despite Terry s warning to disperse for the day, at least 
      half of the 40 Wolves are back to hanging out in front of 
      their row of walk ups. To the naked eye they just look like a 
      bunch of high school aged (and younger) boys, playing cards, 
      talking quietly to each other or on their cell phones.

    But there s a slight air of being on their best behavior, 
      like they ve all got a secret.

      KENNY S POV   The young mouthy T-Rex.

    The only kid who looks hyper, like the secret is too much for 
      him.

                    They were told to book. Let s run 
                    them off.

                          (eyes on T-Rex)
                    They re just there. I want to check 
                    them out a little.

                                  KITERUNNER
                    Man, how do you keep so calm?

                                  KENNY
                    My family s been wearing blue since 
                    before I was born. I know the 
                    drill.

                    You think you re the only one who s

                    Sutton, I got a great uncle who 
                    arrested Crazy JoeyGalloand my 
                    father was part of the team who 
                    arrested Son of Sam.

                    Then they re just criminals.

      KENNY S POV   He sees T-Rexhead off alone to the corner

                                  KENNY
                    I got it.


      KITERUNNER S POV   T-Rexwalking out of the store. He sits on 
      a stoop alone, away from the rest of the 40 Wolves, catching 
    his breath.

      Kenny exits the store with his coffee, walks past the 
      freaking out T-Rexwithout acknowledging him.

                                  KITERUNNER
                    Where s my tea?

                    This thing is going down.

      ANGLE   MICHELLE, T-Rex ssister, watching from another 
      stoop.

    Her gaze goes from her little brother on one corner to the 
      loitering 40 sin front of the walkupsto Kenny on his 
      footrest.

    She catches her brother s eye and gestures for him to go 
      upstairs. He waves her off. 

    She looks desperate.

      ANGLE   SIDESTREET. 40 Wolves buildings. More 40sare coming 
      back to their hangout, some casually going inside the foyers 
    of the walkups, then coming back out flat-faced but giving 
    off a vibethat they might be carrying/ hiding something.


      ANGLE   PLAYGROUND BENCHES. Same thing, GCG kids increasing 
    in number, walking as if concealing things, calm but alert.                                                                                    45.

      Kiterunner and Kenny standing there, watching the Wolves, who

                    There s got to be twenty kids there

                    We should break  em up. Or do you 
                    want to call for...

      Abruptly, all 20 of the GCGs, suddenly brandishing weapons, 
    go charging as a group out of the playground.

    It looks like they re going to attack the rookies but they 
      veer at the last moment towards Footposts42 and 43, towards 
    the 40 Wolves.

                                  WHITE HOUSE (CONT D)
                    Goddamn!

      White House and Franchise have no choice but to run parallel 
    to the pack trying to head them off, but the GCGsaren t even 
      paying attention to them.


      Kenny and Kiterunner turn to the sound of two beer bottles 
      smashing into each other, two more weapons.

    See a similar sudden massing of 40 Wolves, one kid (Paris) 
      charging out of a walkupwith a baseball bat, howling like a 
      banshee and before they can react, the Wolves are off running 
    at full speed towards Footposts42 and 41, towards the GCGs
      running full speed at them.

      Like White House and Franchise, all they can do is run 
      parallel, attempt to cut them off but the Wolves only have 
      eyes for the other gang.

      OVERHEAD   See the charging gangs racing towards each other 
      from Footpost41, from Footpost43, the cops trying to keep 
    up until they all COLLIDE at Footpost42.

      CLOSE ON - THE ACTION, din of battle, kids wailing on each 
      other, getting hit, cut...

    All four cops are now in the middle, back to back to back to 
      back.                                                                                    47.


      Wherever they can, they disarm, they tackle, they cuff, they 
      disperse. They trade blows.

      They are heroically standing their ground (it helps that the 
      gangs don t care about them).

      CLOSE ON   KITERUNNER   A whirlwind, a martial artist, 
      snatching weapons, side-sweeping kids to the ground and 
      cuffing them, disarming jagged bottles, slashing razors, 
      wresting away pipes and bats.

      CLOSE ON   WHITE HOUSE   Also a trained combatant (ex-MP) 
      mixing it up with a big teenager and holding her own, on the 
      verge of slamming him to the street and cuffing him when 
      FRANCHISE, assuming she s in over her head, wrestles the kid 
      away from her and subdues him on his own. White House is 
      PISSED.

      CLOSE ON   KENNY - Cuffing a kid, looks up and sees...

      LITTLE T-REX- Just standing there in the middle of 
      everything, immobile, big-eyed. And behind him, a big GCG is 
      wielding an iron pipe, taking it back for a full swing as if 
    to knock his head off his shoulders.

                                                                      SMASHCUT TO:

      KENNY,

      flinging himself at T-Rex, tackles him, taking the brunt of 
    the swing on his own shoulder but saving T-Rex slife.

    IN THE DISTANCE   Can be seen the 7th Cavalry, patrol and 
      anti-crime cars, misery lights flashing, sirens wailing AND 
      JUST LIKE THAT all combatants, en masse, GCGsand Wolves 
      almost pulling each other along like comrades, start to haul 
    ass out of there.

                                  LAZARUS
                     Trust you?   Cover you?  What the 
                    hell was that?

                                  TONYA
                          (in shock)
                    What did I do again?

      Anna comes out with the baby.

    As the radio car pulls out, Anna hails a taxi.

    ON ANNA - For a moment it looks like maybe she s leaving him 
      after all but...

                                  ANNA
                    Where s the precinct house?

                                  LAZARUS
                    Just follow them.

      Yoda in his van is glaring daggers at them too.

      A sedan pulls up, a rumpled young man with a forensics bag 
      steps out.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    I m from the Coroner s Office.
                          (beat)
                    So where s the stiff?


      Kenny, heading out after the tour, is accosted by Michelle, 
    the sister of T-Rex, the kid Kenny saved.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (offering her hand)
                    I'm Michelle Terry.

                                  KENNY
                        (a little flustered)
                    I know.
                          (beat)
                    Kenny McCormack.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (still holding his hand)
                    I wanted to meet you to say thank 
                    you for what you did.

                                  KENNY
                    What I did?

                                  MICHELLE
                    You saved my brother from God knows 
                    what kind of injury.                                                                                    55.


                                  KENNY
                    He s OK?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yeah, are you?

                                  KENNY
                          (blushing)
                    Me? I ll live.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Good.
                          (beat)
                    Look, I need for you to know that 
                    T, he s a pretty good kid, but he s 
                    got to show heart out there, 
                    especially  cause he s a newcomer.

                                  KENNY
                    You got to keep an eye on him.

                                  MICHELLE
                    See, that s the thing. I can t 
                    mother him in front of the others, 
                    that would be like a disaster, and 
                    I can t lock him in the house, 
                    so... I was thinkin ... given
                    you re gonnabe out in Wolf 
                    territory for awhile maybe you 
                    could kindakeep an eye on him for 
                    me.
                          (beat)
                    He s just a child...
                          (beat)
                    and I would surely appreciate it.

      CLOSE ON, Michelle slowly sliding her fingers out of his 
      grasp.

                                  KENNY
                          (flustered)
                    They move us around a lot.
                          (beat)
                    But I ll see what I can do.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (leaving)
                    Alright then, thank you.

    ON KENNY - Watching her go... Gangbanger'ssister.                                                                                    56.



      Franchise, in jeans, shooting hoops by himself in the 
      playground where he confronted Mo Bailey.

      White House, wanting to make things less tense between them, 
      steps onto the court.

    At first they don't know what to say to each other.

      Then they silently start to shoot around.

      Then just for the hell of it, White House drives on him, 
      Franchise easily blocking her shot.

    She tries again, and again, getting nowhere against this NBA
      level player, but she's into it; he's into it.

      They start to sweat, two spectacular looking young athletes, 
      it's getting physical, real physical.

    And then White House, as if hearing some internal alarm bell 
    go off, just stops, a little shaken, and walks off the court 
      without a word.

      Franchise, rattled, stares after her.


      Tonya, in civvies, waiting in a crowd.

      TONYA'S POV - YODA in his van, beckoning to her.


      Huge low-income housing project in the precinct.
