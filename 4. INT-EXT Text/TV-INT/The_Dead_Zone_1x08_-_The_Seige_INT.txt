          Two tellers, KAREN HAYES (28) and TOM KELLY (23), are
          each with customers... There's a DING from the door as
          Sarah enters O.C.

                                        KAREN
                                (counting out money)
                        Ten, twenty, thirty, forty...

          As Tom finishes the transaction with his customer --

                                        TOM
                        Thank you.  Next in line please.

          The next customer, MELANIE ROMANO (35), approaches Tom's
          window.

          ANGLE ON SARAH

          filling out a deposit slip... the camera wanders across
          the bank finding the GUARD (RUDY YOUNG, 55), sitting easily
          by the door... then to Vice-President and General Manager
          HENRY SPAHN (40) in the waiting area greeting an elderly
          couple MR. STRATTON and MRS. STRATTON (late 70's+).

                                        SPAHN
                        Mr. and Mrs. Stratton.  Come have
                        a seat in my office.

          As they move to his office --


          ANGLE OUT THE WINDOW TO SEE A PICKUP TRUCK

          that's seen better days pulling into the parking lot,
          going too fast over the speed bumps, HURLEY ELECTRICAL*
          CONTRACTING painted on its doors.  The truck parks in the*
          furthest space at the back of the lot.  The driver, CONRAD
          HURLEY (45), gets out.  He's wearing clean work clothes
          and carrying a big, long, heavy tool box.  He has the
          weary, self-pitying eyes, in a William Macy kind of way,
          of a man who has endured more than his share of bad luck
          and bad breaks.  He drinks but he's not drunk this morning.


          ANGLE ON TELLER WINDOWS

          As Karen's customer finishes and moves away --

                                        KAREN
                        Next please.

          Sarah smiles and walks to the counter.


          AT THE DOOR OF THE BANK

          The original two CUSTOMERS EXIT.  A moment later, Conrad
          comes in.

          DING from the door.  Security guard Rudy Young looks up
          as Conrad enters.

                          Morning, Conrad.

          Conrad pauses and looks over for an extra beat as though
          his life is flashing before his eyes and then just says
          with a certain resignation:

                                        CONRAD
                        Hey Rudy. 


          MOVING BY SARAH

          to catch just a snatch of conversation at the teller's
          booth with Karen Hayes...

                        Maybe we could do a silent
                        auction...


          MOVING TOWARD SPAHN'S OFFICE

                                        SPAHN*
                                (to the Strattons)*
                        ...I've reviewed your Ira and*

          Conrad marches up to him.

                          Henry...

          Spahn isn't happy to see Conrad but he remains
            professionally cordial.

                                        SPAHN
                        I'm busy right now, Conrad.

                                        CONRAD
                          I really need to talk to you,
                        Henry.

                          Morning, Mrs. Stratton, Mr.

                        Heard from Arleta, Conrad?

          It's the kind of blunt curiosity that only old people get
          away with.  Mrs. Stratton gives her husband an embarrassed
          elbow to the side.  Mr. Stratton looks at her...

                                        CONRAD
                        No, no, I haven't heard from her,
                        Mr. Stratton.  Henry, if I could...

          Spahn grits his teeth...

                                        SPAHN
                                (to the couple)
                        I'll only be a second.

          He moves away from them...

                                        SPAHN
                        If this is about the contract,
                        there's nothing to talk about.

                                        CONRAD
                          Seventeen years I've worked in
                        this township, Henry; I... I'd
                        say I've done a pretty fair job
                        on all your electrical work,
                        haven't I...?  Henry?  Don't I
                        deserve at least the chance to...

                                        SPAHN
                        The Council voted and that's it. 
                        I'm sorry.  

          Spahn walks away from him back to the Strattons.  Conrad
          lets out a deep breath...

                                        CONRAD
                              (a sad smile)
                        Yeah.  Me too.

          He CLANGS his toolbox down on Spahn's desk.  Spahn and
          the Strattons jump and everyone else looks over.  Conrad
          opens the toolbox and takes out a short-barrel 12-gauge*
          pump action shotgun.  The Strattons' eyes go wide as Conrad*
          brandishes the gun... and although he is a man who knows*
          guns, he is no expert at bank robbery and he's scared to
          death...  

                                        CONRAD
                        Okay.  Okay.  All of you -- put

          hands on their heads right away... others like Spahn who
          know Conrad hesitate thinking at first this isn't
          serious...

                                        CONRAD (CONT'D)
                        Rudy, come on over here with the
                        others.  And I'll need your gun. 
                        Don't try to be a hero, okay? 

                                        GUARD
                        You're calling the shots, Conrad.

          He follows the orders and crosses to Conrad with his hands
          raised but his eyes are alert and ready for an opportunity. 
          There is none.  Conrad takes the .38 revolver out of Rudy's*
          holster.  

                                        CONRAD

                                  amazement)
                        Conrad, what are you doing?

                        What's it look like I'm doing,
                        Henry?  I'm robbing your bank.

                        You had to bring up the wife.

                        Mrs. Stratton, I'm sorry but I
                        need you to put your hands on
                        your head.  If you'll all just
                        cooperate, this will be over

                        if you don't put that gun down.*

          Spahn starts to walk toward the door.  Conrad picks up*

          Spahn, who stops in his tracks and turns white...*

          panning to find it's DANA's POV we've been seeing.  She
          parks and gets out.



          Karen and Tom are emptying the contents of the teller
          drawers into ordinary banker's boxes.  Sarah, Melanie and
          the Strattons huddle in the back.  Sarah comforts Mrs.

                        It'll be okay, Mrs. Stratton. 
                        You heard him - he doesn't want
                        to hurt anybody.

          Conrad crosses to the vault with the shotgun, watching
          Spahn open cabinets, one after another, each with its own
          key.

                                        SARAH
                                (nods, whispers)
                        Where's -- ?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (before she can finish)
                          Outside, with Dana Bright. 
                        He's fine. 

          She reaches for his hand.  As their fingers intertwine,
          Johnny's hit with --


1111A JOHNNY FLASH - THE GUARD AND CONRAD - SLOW MOTION

          Rudy has made a move for the gun and they're struggling
          for it... it discharges... swish panning to Sarah who,
          still holding hands with Johnny on the floor, has caught
          the full force of the bullet in her chest and has fallen
            backwards... 


  1212RESUME - REGULAR MOTION

          as Johnny sees the guard is moving back from the door...
          eyes already glancing toward Conrad whose attention is
          diverted by the activity in the vault.  The guard is about
          to make his move when...   

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sir?

          Conrad turns and sees Rudy coming back and that's the end
          of that idea.

          The guard frowns as Conrad looks to Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        ...uh, actually I do have a meter
                        running outside... exactly how
                        long do you think we'll be...

                                        CONRAD
                        Be quiet.

                        Yessir.

          Conrad exchanges a suspicious glance with the guard who
          goes to sit and almost seems to guess what almost happened
          but moves back to business.  

                                        TOM
                        You want travellers checks, Conrad?

                                        CONRAD
                          Travelers checks, cashiers
                          checks... the whole shebang.  And
                        if you're thinking about tracing
                        the numbers when I cash them,
                        Tom, I'll save you the trouble...
                        I'm going to Jamaica...

                                        KAREN
                        What are you gonna do in Jamaica,
                        Conrad.

                                        CONRAD
                        What do you think I'm gonna do. 
                        I'm gonna sit in the sand and
                        drink co-co-no-nos.

                                        MELANIE
                        It's... it's beautiful this time
                        of year; my husband and I went on
                        our honeymoon...

          Just talking makes her lose control... she begins to shake
          and cry... Conrad sighs...

                                        CONRAD
                        Miss, miss, really, this, this
                        would be easier all around if...

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's scared.  Why don't you just
                        let her go.

                          please... you got an hysterical
                          customer here...

          There are four banker's boxes filled with negotiables and
            currency, and with the lids on you'd think they held
          nothing but records.  Now Spahn stacks them onto a small
          dolly and secures them with a bungee cord as Conrad slings
          the shotgun and takes the .38 from a shoulder holster*
          under his jacket.

                        You people are going to stay in
                        here and count to a thousand. 
                        Slowly.  Don't do anything stupid. 
                        It's not your money, understand?

          He scans their faces - just the eye contact with Melanie
          makes her whimper louder... he finally comes to Sarah...

                                        CONRAD
                        ...you.  

          He motions for her to come forward but Johnny steps in
          front of her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's got a son.  Take me instead.

          He stands... Conrad studies him.  Unlike the others, Johnny
          doesn't seem scared -- he's not acting right.

                                        CONRAD
                        You just don't quit, do you?  Who

                        My name is Smith.  John Smith.  

          Conrad looks at him, something doesn't feel right about
          him, shakes his head, decides not to take him along... 

                                        CONRAD
                        No, no, you're staying here.

          He pokes Johnny back with the barrel of the shotgun and

          Conrad ignores this and continues to stare at Johnny.

          Conrad's whole face darkens.  Johnny is really unnerving
          him.  He shoves the gun hard into Spahn, propelling him
          forward toward the front door...

          The lights are now off.  Conrad is clearly spooked.  He*
          holsters the .38, unslings the shotgun and marches to*
          confront Johnny.

                                        CONRAD
                        How'd you know the Sheriff was
                        out there?  Are you a cop?

          He points the weapon and expects an answer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        CONRAD
                        Then how.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I called them.

                                        CONRAD
                        When?

                        Before I came in the bank.

                        How could you call them before
                        you... 

          And then it all comes together in his mind.

                                        CONRAD
                        You're that guy.  The, the, the
                        one who... sees things.

                                  acknowledges)
                        ...And you're screwing up my bank

                        me.

          Johnny just looks evenly at him.  

                                        CONRAD
                        You think that scares me?  It
                          doesn't.  When I got up this
                          morning, I decided that this was
                        the day I was going to Jamaica or
                        the day I was going to hell.

          Outside, a SIREN approaches.  Conrad's mind's racing.  He
          goes to the window.

                                        CONRAD (CONT'D)

          FADE IN:


          All the hostages seated together on the floor.  Conrad is
          scrambling up on a desk and, using the butt of the shotgun
          like a club, he knocks one of the surveillance cameras
          off its pedestal.  It SMASHES to the floor.  Sarah comforts
          Melanie as she shivers and whimpers with each smash.

                                        TOM
                        What's the point of that?

          The phone continues to ring... Conrad brushes his hair
          back with his hand uncertainly...

                                        CONRAD
                        Okay.  Okay.  Everybody who needs
                        a bathroom break go with Karen. 
                        But, but leave the door open.

                                        MRS. STRATTON
                        I'm not leaving the door open,
                        Conrad.

          She struggles to get to her feet and as Johnny and Sarah
          assist her... Johnny reacts to --


2424A JOHNNY FLASH 

          of Mr. Stratton, on his knees beside a supine and
          motionless Mrs. Stratton, shaking her desperately.

                                        MR. STRATTON IN THE VISION
                        Wake up!  Edna -- please -- wake
                        up!


  2525RESUME

          With dread in his eyes, Johnny watches Mr. Stratton move
          with his wife toward the bathroom... then finds Sarah
          looking at him intently.

                                        SARAH
                                (low)
                        You saw something, didn't you?

          He looks to Sarah, acknowledging silently...


          MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          as, warily, he approaches Conrad... who is trying to ignore
          the ringing phone...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to talk to you.

          Conrad can't believe it: here's Johnny, breaking his balls
          again.

                                (keeping his voice
                                low)
                        Mrs. Stratton is about to have
                        either a heart attack or a stroke. 
                        She's going to have to go to a
                          hospital.

                                        CONRAD
                        I do not want to hear your crap! 
                        Do you understand me?!

          He finally answers the phone that has been ringing off
          the hook...

                                        CONRAD
                                (to phone)
                        What?

                                                                                INTERCUT



          Conrad has Spahn look out the blinds...

                                        SPAHN
                        The ambulance is here.  

                                        SARAH
                        Let Mr. Stratton go with her.

                                        CONRAD
                        No, I'm not letting any others
                        go.

                                        SARAH
                                (firm)
                        They've been married fifty years. 
                        He needs to be with her.

          And Conrad looks at the Strattons and perhaps he's thinking
          of his own wife as he sighs and says...

                                        CONRAD
                        Fine, he can go.
                                (turns to Johnny)
                        You help him take her out.  But I
                        want you back, and when you come
                        bring a TV.

          Johnny acknowledges and then as an afterthought, Conrad
          grabs him firmly by the arm...


3030A JOHNNY FLASH - THE BANK INTERIOR - SLOW MOTION

          filled with smoke... broken apart... wounded and dead
          hostages... Conrad sprawled dead on the floor... police
          and paramedics moving inside...


  3131RESUME

          Conrad still holding his arm...

                                        CONRAD
                        I'm trusting you to come back
                        cause I figure you might know
                        what happens to these people if
                        you don't... partner.

          On Johnny's somber nod...          DEAD ZONE: THE SIEGE - ACT TWO - 05/10/02 - GREEN     26.



          The TV's been set up and everyone's watching live coverage
          of the scene from outside.  We see aerial images of the
          siege on the screen. 

                                        NEWSMAN (CONT'D)
                                (on the TV)
                        ...Channel Four News has learned
                        that one of the hostages inside
                        the bank is Sarah Bannerman, wife
                        of Sheriff Walt Bannerman, who
                        happens to be in charge of the
                          situation here in Cleaves Mills
                        this morning...


          FAVORING SARAH

          as Conrad reacts to this news.  He steps in front of the
          TV and turns the SOUND OFF.

                                        CONRAD
                                (an angry beat)
                          Sheriff's wife, huh?  And nobody
                        told me... 

          He looks at Johnny accusingly... then to the women...

                                        CONRAD
                        It's gotta be one of you two. 
                        Lemme see ID's.

                                        SARAH
                        That's not necessary.  I'm Sarah
                        Bannerman.  Here's my driver's
                          license.

          She hands it to him.  Conrad looks at it for a long time.

                        You just got to be my ticket out

          Off her reaction...          DEAD ZONE: THE SIEGE - ACT THREE - 05/10/02 - GREEN   31.



          Conrad listening to the receiver...

                                        SARAH
                        I'm fine.  How's Little Johnny? *

                        He's fine.  He doesn't know what's*

                        calling to tell you Mr. Hurley's
                          demands.

                                        WALT
                        He knows who you are?

                                        SARAH
                        It was on TV.

                                        WALT
                        Dammit.  What does he want?

                                        SARAH
                          A helicopter.  Then a jet plane
                        with enough fuel to fly to Jamaica. 
                        And he wants to take a hostage
                        with him.  Me.

                                        WALT
                        No way I'm letting him...

          Conrad takes the phone from Sarah...

                                        CONRAD
                          Anything happens to me, it happens
                        to her first.  Understand, Sheriff? 
                        I hate to see another man lose
                        his wife for no good reason.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE SIEGE - ACT THREE - 05/10/02 - GREEN  31A.*


    39CONTINUED:39

          He hangs up...



          Catching Conrad in mid-rant to a very scared Sarah...

                                        CONRAD
                        If something happens, it's his
                        fault, not mine.  Not mine.  Stop
                        staring at me.  Go sit down.

          Sarah's pretty shaken up at this point... she sits beside
          Johnny on the floor... a tear rolls down her cheek...
          Johnny searches for the words to comfort her...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt's gonna do the right thing.

                                        SARAH
                        What if there isn't a 'right
                        thing'.  What then?

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's got to be.  We just... we
                        just have to find it... together.

                                        SARAH
                        Have you seen a way out of this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a moment to moment
                          proposition.

                        Just like the rest of life.

          A beat as she considers him... and this is said with as
          much love as we've ever heard from Sarah...

                                        SARAH
                        I'm glad you're here.

          And as soon as she says it, she knows how ridiculous it
            sounds... 

                                        SARAH
                        I don't mean I'm glad you're here
                        here.  I mean, I...
                                (she begins to giggle
                                  quietly)
                        What a stupid thing to say at a
                        time like this...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (grins easily)
                        I can't think of any place I'd
                        rather be...

          Conrad glares over... and that ends their incongruous
          smiles.  Sarah takes a long breath...

                                        SARAH
                        It changes things.  Something
                        like this.  Forces you to ask
                          yourself what you really want.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have everything you really
                        want, Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                        Do I?

          He studies her.  A beat.

                                        SARAH
                        Right now, I just want you to put
                        your arm around me.

          He does... and on his touch... the skin on Sarah's face
          peels away and the flesh disintegrates leaving nothing
          but a skull which pops into dust... and as the vision
          ends...

                        You know why she left me?  She
                        said I was boring.

          A beat as the sad irony sinks in.

          Johnny stands, goes to the TV... as he turns the sound

          Conrad mutes the sound.  Johnny is aghast.  Sarah's staring*
          at him as he moves back to her.  Like a sleepwalker trying

                        What are you going to do? 

          And as we push into Johnny's face as he tries to figure
          that out...

                        could get hurt...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  But if I don't warn him...

          He sighs and off this quandary...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          Conrad scans the floor and his eyes fix on the steel plate -
          a clear line to the phone.  The phone keeps RINGING. 
          Conrad stares at Johnny.

          And lowers the gun.



          Conrad checks the ammo in the revolver.  He seems to be*
            preparing for the assault he knows must come soon now. 
          Then WALT'S VOICE comes over a BULLHORN outside:

                                        WALT'S VOICE

                        to get into the bank.  You've got
                        my word on it.  We're bringing in
                        a van that will take you to a

                        hundred yards down the road...  

          Conrad looks over at Johnny.

                        He telling the truth?

                        You sure you want to know?

          Conrad isn't, but he nods anyway.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not your fortune teller.  You
                        want a partner?  I'll work with

          Hurley thinks about that for a long moment.

          Melanie still whimpers.  Letting her out suddenly seems
          like a good idea.  Conrad nods.

                        Hell, I'm tired of her crying

                        Take a bullet out of your gun and
                        give it to me.

          Conrad looks dubious, then opens the cylinder of the .38*
          and takes out a bullet, replacing it with another from
          his pocket.  He tosses the bullet, underhand, across the
          room to Johnny.

          going from the door of the bank to a waiting van.  Conrad
          has one hand on Sarah, a gun at her back.  A SHARPSHOOTER

          Conrad's watching Johnny closely.  He comes out of it and
          slips the bullet into his pocket.

                                        CONRAD
                        Well?

                        Still another undesirable outcome.

                        What do you do about it, Conrad. 
                                (beat)
                        Every choice you make has a
                          consequence in the future.  One
                        wrong choice and you lose.  We
                        all do.  I'm just trying to help
                        you figure out the right choices
                        here.

                        What choices do I have left?

          Johnny motions to the hostages...

                                        CONRAD
                        I got nothing if I let them go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've got nothing if you keep
                        them.  

                                        CONRAD
                        How do I know you're not bluffing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't.  But I'm not.  If you
                        keep the hostages, you're going
                        to die, Conrad.

                                        CONRAD
                        That's not the worst thing that
                        could happen.

                                (beat)
                        You won't be the only one who
                        dies, Conrad.  I know you didn't
                        come here today to hurt anybody.

                                        CONRAD
                        That's God's honest truth.

          Johnny picks up on 'God' and takes a calculated risk with
          this argument --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't speak to what you'll find
                        when you cross on to the other
                        side.  But you sure you want the
                        burden of somebody else's death
                        on your hands when you get there?

          And that seems to weigh on Conrad.

                                        CONRAD
                        You a religious man, John?

                        I am today.

                        I used to be.  

          Conrad studies him... then...

                        goes without saying -- whatever
                        happens to me, happens to you.  

          Johnny frowns, frustrated.   But he backs off for the
          moment.  At the door --

                        It wasn't your fault, Henry.  I
                        know I've slipped a little lately. 
                        This was supposed to turn all
                        that around.

          He throws the bullet to Johnny.  He lets it drop to the

                        not is up to you. 

          Conrad doesn't move, just stares at him.

          She's out.



          Johnny's leg is starting to ache.  He eases himself into

                        Coulda, woulda, shoulda.  I never
                        got any breaks, anyway.  Why should
                        I get any now?

                        I think you got a break.

          numbers on it and folds back the top sheet of paper....

          A long beat.  As they look at each other.  Finally, Johnny

                        Listen to me.  I'm one to give
                        advice.

          He picks up the shotgun.  He works the action to EJECT
          all five shells from it, then puts it down.
