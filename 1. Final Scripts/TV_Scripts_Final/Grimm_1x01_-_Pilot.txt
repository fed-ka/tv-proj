                                            TEASER

      FADE IN:

      We HEAR the Moody Blues' "Once Upon a Time In Your Wildest
      Dreams" as we reveal:

      CLOSE ON A PERSONAL LICENSE PLATE: SMILE 1. It may take a
      moment to realize, the license plate is moving.

1EXT. OREGON - EARLY MORNING1

      HELICOPTER SHOT: PULL BACK from the license plate to reveal
      a bright YELLOW VAN on a TWO LANE HIGHWAY.  As we PULL HIGHER
      we see FOREST on both sides of the road.  The van slows and
      turns onto a dirt forest service road.

      But we CONTINUE on PULLING HIGHER to reveal the vast forest
      surrounding a medium sized city nestled in the Pacific
      Northwest.  Portland.

      SHOT CONTINUES into Portland proper.  It's early morning and
      traffic is already filling the streets.

      SHOT CONTINUES over the city to a UNIVERSITY CAMPUS right
      towards a UNIVERSITY DORM and right into --*

      SYLVIE, 18, a U. of Portland freshman, all the way to her*
      iPod ear buds playing The MOODY BLUES SONG. *

      Sylvie is exiting her dorm and pulling on her red sweat shirt. *
      Starts jogging.  A FEW STUDENTS are moving about.*

      Sylvie runs across campus and into the surrounding forest. *

2EXT. FOREST - MORNING2

      The path through the forest is well worn.  Sylvie is in good
      shape, breathing steady.  THROUGH THE TREES all we can see
      is her RED HOODED SWEATSHIRT against the forest green.

      Sylvie approaches a fork in the trail, chooses the path less
      traveled.  The rain forest is dense, but shafts of morning*
      light endow the woods with a warm glow.  She powers up the*
      trail, heading toward a large boulder next to a ravine. *
      Birds and butterflies rise in the morning air.  A serene,
      magical morning.  As she passes the boulder, we SEE A SUDDEN
      FLASH of MOVEMENT.                                                                                        2.

      Something moves with blinding speed, hitting Sylvie, knocking*
      her completely off the trail and into the ravine below.  Her
      iPod goes flying.

      We HEAR SCREAMS -- drowned out by vicious SNARLING.  Suddenly*
      all is silent except for the MUTED MUSIC of the Moody Blues*
      coming from her PINK iPod in the brush.

                                    IPOD MOODY BLUES
                    ... once upon a time in your wildest
                    dreams...

3EXT. C'EST LA VIE BAKERY - DAY3*

      A new French bakery in the old part of downtown Portland. 
      C'EST LA VIE on the window.  Fresh baked goods and coffee. 

4INT. C'EST LA VIE BAKERY - DAY4

      NICK BURCKHARDT, 28, suit and tie, enters, looks around,*
      sees JULIETTE LAMBERT, 26, a bundle of beauty and energy,*
      serving croissants and coffee to young urban professionals
      and university students.  The place is bustling.  Juliette
      sees Nick.  Picks up two bags of pastries off the counter:

                                      JULIETTE
                    Got you right here.

      Nick takes the bags, leans in for a kiss.

                                    NICK
                    You sure do.
                          (glances around)
                    You're packed.

                                      JULIETTE
                    We're kickin' some early mornin'
                    butt.

                                    NICK
                    You're gonna be home tonight for
                    dinner, right?

                                      JULIETTE
                    Why wouldn't I be.

                                    NICK
                    Just making sure you don't have yoga
                    or something.

                                      JULIETTE
                    No, why, you got something in mind.

      She smiles.  He smiles back.

                                    NICK
                    I always have something in mind.                                                                                        3.*

5EXT. STREET - DAY5*

      Nick exits the bakery.  HANK GREEN, late forties, suit and*
      tie, stands by a car, digital camera in hand.  He shoots*
      pictures of Nick exiting the bakery.*

                                      NICK*
                    What are you doing?*

                                      HANK*
                    Trying to make this thing work. *

      Hank turns the camera on TWO GOOD-LOOKING 20ish WOMEN walking*
      towards them.  Both are well dressed.  The blonde carries a*
      briefcase; the brunette is talking on her blackberry.

      Hank snaps a couple of photos, checks the screen.*

                                    HANK (CONT'D)*
                    Nothing.  We're gonna have to take*
                    it in.*

      As they pass, the blonde glances at Nick.  She smiles.  He*
      smiles back.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)*
                    Hey, hey, what're you lookin' at,*
                    you got a girlfriend --*

                                      NICK*
                    That's not what I'm lookin' at.*

                                      HANK*
                    Don't ruin her for me.*

                                      NICK*
                    She wears Armani, makes low six*
                    figures, drives a BMW and she's
                    falling for a senior partner at her
                    law firm.  Nothing but trouble, Hank.

                                      HANK*
                    Why can't you just look at her ass*
                    like the rest of us.

      Hank gets in the car.  We HEAR radio CHATTER. *

      The beautiful blonde glances back at Nick, sensing something. *
      She suddenly MORPHS into a HIDEOUS LOOKING OLD WITCH.  Nick
      is stunned.  He blinks and just that quickly the woman is
      once again herself.

      Nick shakes off the image, not sure what just happened, then --*

                                    HANK (CONT'D)*
                    Nick, get in the car, we got a call. *                                                                                        4.

6INT. CAR - DAY6*

      Nick gets in as Hanks starts up the car.*

                                      HANK*
                    Body off a trail in McIver Park.

                                    NICK
                    Man or woman?

                                    HANK
                    They couldn't tell.

      Rear window POLICE LIGHTS start FLASHING.  Car speeds off*
      down the street, SIREN BLASTING.*

7EXT. PORTLAND STREET - DAY7*

      At the intersection, LIGHT CHANGES to RED, Nick runs through*
      it.  We PAN UP TO the BRIDGE ABOVE discovering an SUV PULLING*
      AN AIRSTREAM TRAILER into downtown Portland.*

8INT. SUV - CONTINUOUS - DAY8

      MARIE BRANNIGAN, 49, a weathered beauty, is behind the wheel. *
      She's pale and determined.  AND SHE'S BALD.  She keeps*
      glancing in the side view mirrors as if she's being followed.*

9EXT. BRIDGE - DAY9

      About eight cars behind Marie's SUV we find a mid-nineties
      GREEN corvette.

10INT. CORVETTE - DAY10

      Behind the wheel is a slightly chubby middle aged man with a
      bad comb-over, mid-life crisis screams from every pore of
      his body.  His name is HULDA and as --*

11EXT. BRIDGE - DAY11

      Marie takes a left turn, the corvette continues past.

12EXT. PORTLAND STREET - DAY12

      Marie's SUV continues down the street, turning right at
      another intersection.

      A moment later the green corvette appears from an alley,
      following her.

13EXT. FOREST/CRIME SCENE - DAY13

      HIGH ANGLE SHOT, looking down through the thick magical
      forest.  And we discover Nick and Hank, badges on their coats,
      being lead down the trail by a FOREST SERVICE OFFICER.  OTHER
      COPS are in evidence.                                                                                        5.

                                      FOREST OFFICER
                    The hiker flagged me down, he came
                    through the ravine and he found this.

      Off the trail now, the forest service officer shows them a
      severed forearm.  A small piece of a RED RIPPED SWEATSHIRT
      is still on the arm.  Nick kneels down, carefully studies
      the cloth and arm and the ground around it.

                                    NICK
                    This ground's undisturbed.  This all
                    there is?

                                      FOREST OFFICER
                    The rest of her is in the ravine.

      They move down into--

      THE RAVINE -- rugged and overgrown.  They move down, stopping*
      when they see something pretty gruesome that we don't see.

      There's a lot of blood splatter on the bushes.  Leaves torn
      from branches, branches broken.  It was a violent attack.

                                    NICK
                    How do you know it's a her?

      Forest Service Officer moves some brush aside, revealing a
      pink tennis shoe.

                                    HANK
                    Woman's Nike.

                                    NICK
                    What kind of animal could do this?

                                      FOREST OFFICER
                    Normally we'd be able to tell by the
                    tracks: bear, cougar, wolf...

                                    HANK
                    Well which is it?

                                      FOREST OFFICER
                    That's where it gets interesting.

      He leads them to some bare ground, shows them a BOOT PRINT.

                                      FOREST OFFICER (CONT'D)
                    This is the only track we found.

                                    NICK
                          (yells up to cop)
                    We got a boot print down here, gonna
                    need a cast.                                                                                        6.

                                    HANK
                          (to Forest Service
                            Officer)
                    DNA'll tell us if this is your case
                    or ours.

      Hank and Nick start back up the ravine to the trail.

                                    NICK
                    This sounds like what happened a
                    month ago, at Munson Creek Falls.

                                    HANK
                    Same deal.  Hiker and a bobcat.

                                    NICK
                    But the bobcat wasn't wearing boots.

                                    HANK
                    Ever try putting cuffs on a bobcat?*

                                    NICK
                          (stops)
                    You hear that?

                                    HANK
                    What?

                                    NICK
                    Music.

      Nick moves off, searches in the brush, discovers something.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    Hank, there's an iPod over here.

      Without touching it, Nick leans in, checks the iPod screen. 
      Name of the song (Your Wildest Dreams) scrolls past.

14EXT. ROADSIDE - FOREST - DAY14

      Nick, iPod in a baggie, and Hank return to their car. 
      AMBULANCE is on scene, patrol cars, C.S.I. team, etc.

                                    HANK
                    Gotta be an animal.

                                    NICK
                    I'm hoping it's an animal.

                                    HANK
                    Unless he butchered her on the spot,
                    took the pieces with him.                                                                                        7.

                                    NICK
                    I don't think so, he would have had
                    to bag her up, we would have seen
                    drag marks, maybe some tape or
                    plastic.

                                    HANK
                    We don't have much to go on.  Except
                    a lousy boot print.

                                    NICK
                    And the iPod.

                                    HANK
                    If it's hers.

                                    NICK
                    The song was on "repeat".  Somebody
                    must've really liked it.

                                    HANK
                    What was the song?

                                    NICK
                    "Your Wildest Dreams".

                                    HANK
                    Moody Blues, one of their better.
                          (starts singing)
                    "Once upon a time in your wildest
                    dreams."

      Nick shoots him a look.

                                    NICK
                    I didn't know you couldn't sing.

15INT. POLICE STATION - ROBBERY/HOMICIDE - DAY15

      Nick and Hank head for their desks.

                                    NICK
                    Until we get the DNA results, I'll
                    run a database on violent predators
                    in the area...

      Nick glances at an ANGRY PERP, a tatted up young man
      handcuffed to a desk, being interviewed by a detective.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    We should also take another look at
                    the Munson Creek Falls attack.

                                    HANK
                    Sounds like you'll be busy.  I'll
                    take the iPod down for prints...                                                                                        8.

      Angry Perp looks at Nick as they pass.  His face suddenly
      MORPHS into the face of an OWL.  But just for an instant. 
      Then he's Angry Perp again.  And turns away.

      Nick's so startled he collides with an older UNIFORM SERGEANT
      BLAKNIKOFF carrying coffee.  Coffee spills.

                                    NICK
                    Sorry.

      Nick glances back at Perp.  Who is still just an Angry Perp.*

      An older suburb.  The SUV pulls down the street and stops.

      being followed, she drives down the street to a --

18EXT. SMALL VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY18

      A bit of a fixer-upper at the end of the street.  Marie pulls
      the SUV and Airstream quickly up the long drive into the
      back yard, out of sight from the street.

19INT. SUV - DAY19

      Marie pries open a small pill box, washes down a handful of
      pills with some water.  Waits to feel better.  Doesn't. 
      Puts a scarf on her bald head.

20EXT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY20

      Marie gets out, moving as fast as she can with a cane to the
      back door, keeping an eye on the street.

      She peers through the window, the house is dark.

      She runs the cane along the top of the door jam.  No key. 
      She looks around, lifts a potted plant.  Revealing a key. 
      For the first time, Marie smiles.

21INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - ROBBERY HOMICIDE - DAY21

      Nick and Hank at their desks, staring at computer screens. 
      Hank's phone rings.  He picks up as:

                    rise to the kind of violence we saw

                    go to class... she could be out there,*
                    she could be really hurt.  *

      Nick sees a photo-magnet on the refrigerator.

                                    HANK
                    D'ya know what kind of running shoes

                    Hank.

      Nick shows the photo magnet to Hank.  Sylvie and the roommate,
      arms around each other, beer cans in hand.  BOTH OF THEM
      WEAR THE RED HOODED UNIVERSITY SWEATSHIRTS.*

24EXT. SMALL VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT24

      A classic old VW panel van with the C'EST LA VIE bakery logo
      on the side parks in front.  Juliette gets out, wearing a*
      RED PEA COAT, walks up the path towards the front door.

      In the house behind her, the curtain moves, Marie watching
      in the dark.  Juliette doesn't see her.

25INT. SMALL VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT25

      Juliette lets herself in.  Flicks on the lights and GASPS
      when she sees Marie standing right next to her.

26EXT. SMALL OLD VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT26*

      Nick drives up in his Mustang.  Parks next to Juliette's VW*
      van.  Nick gets out, shuts the door, pauses, trying to let
      go of the day.  Suddenly he tenses, and turns, looking into
      the night.  CAMERA PUSHES IN on the back of his neck.  EXTREME
      C.U. the hairs on the back of his neck literally stand up.

      NICK - brushes off the feeling and heads for the house.*

27INT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT27

      Nick lets himself in.  All is quiet.  He looks around.

                                    NICK
                    Juliette?

      He HEARS LAUGHTER coming from the kitchen.  He heads for:

28INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT28

      Juliette and Marie are at the kitchen table laughing, bottle
      of wine open between them.  Nick enters.

                                      MARIE
                    Nick!

                                    NICK
                    Aunt Marie?  When did you get here?

                                      JULIETTE
                    She was here when I got home.

                                      MARIE
                    Sorry for the short notice.

                                    NICK
                    What notice?

                                      JULIETTE
                    You didn't know she was coming?

                                      MARIE
                    Well I meant to call.  When I mean
                    to do something I usually assume I
                    have.

      She gets up and moves toward him.

                                    NICK
                    How are you doing?  Are you okay?

                                      MARIE
                    Not okay as I used to be.

                                      MARIE (CONT'D)
                          (opens her arms)
                    Give us a hug.

      He does, exchanging a look with Juliette.

                                      JULIETTE
                    She was telling me some pretty funny
                    stories about when you were little.

                                    NICK
                          (looks at Marie)
                    Dead frog in the microwave?

                                      JULIETTE
                    Among others.

      Nick starts to pull away but Marie holds tight and whispers
      in his ear:

                                      MARIE
                    We need to talk.

      She lets go, staring intently at him.  He's a little unnerved
      by her tone.

                                    NICK
                    I'm going to take a walk with Marie.*

                                      JULIETTE
                    Okay.  I'll make some dinner. 
                    Anything special?

                                      MARIE
                    Anything is fine, dear.

29EXT. NICK'S VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT29

      Marie, cane in hand, walks down the street with Nick.  A
      couple of old streetlights add pools of light to the otherwise
      dark street.  A cool night breeze ruffles the trees.

                                    NICK
                    Aren't you cold?  Don't you want to
                    get a coat?

                                      MARIE
                    I'm just happy to feel anything right
                    now.

                                    NICK
                    How bad is it?

                                      MARIE
                    It's not good, Nick.                                                                                      13.

                    What did they tell you?

                                      MARIE
                    Two months, two weeks, two days,
                    nobody knows.  But there's so many
                    things I have to tell you.

                                    NICK
                    Why didn't you come sooner?

                                      MARIE
                      I couldn't.

                                    NICK
                    Why?

                                      MARIE
                    Don't ask so many questions, just*
                    listen to me.  There are things you
                    don't know, things about your family.

                                    NICK
                    My family?  You're my family.

      She stops, takes hold of his arm and looks into his eyes.

                                      MARIE
                    Have you been seeing strange things,
                    Nick?  Things you can't explain.
                          (off his look)
                    I knew it.  I'm so sorry.  It's
                    happening faster than I expected. 
                    The curse of our family is already
                    passing to you.

                                    NICK
                    What are you talking about?

                                      MARIE
                    After tonight your life will never
                    be the same.  I'm so sorry.  I know
                    you love Juliette and she's perfect
                    for you, but you have to send her
                    away and never see her again.

                                    NICK
                    What?

                                      MARIE
                    I know this is impossible to
                      understand, it was hard for me, too
                    when I was your age.
                          (sees something)
                    Oh my god.  He's here.

      Across the street she sees the candy apple GREEN CORVETTE.*                                                                                      14.*

                                      MARIE (CONT'D)*
                    Mr. Hulda.*

                                    NICK
                    Mr. Hulda?  Who the hell is Mr. --*

      We hear a beastly ROAR; as they turn they are violently
      attacked by a grotesque troll-like creature, oddly dressed
      like a businessman in suit and tie.

      He swings a hatchet-like weapon with a claw at the end. *
      With surprising agility, Marie ducks the weapon, kicking*
      out, catching Hulda painfully in the knee.  Marie follows*
      with a quick punch to his kidney.  Nick tries to move in but*
      is backhanded by Hulda. *

      Nick goes down, looks up as Marie continues her attack. *
      Nick is stunned by Marie's fighting skills.*

      Hulda jabs the claw, this time catching Marie's shoulder,*
      slashing her clothes and drawing blood.*

      Nick tackles the Beast, they go to the ground.  The Beast is*
      up faster than Nick, hitting him as he scrambles to his feet.*

      Nick goes down hard.  Beast turns his attention back to Marie
      as she pulls A BLADE FROM HER CANE and stabs him.  He screams*
      in agony and backhands her.*

      Nick, dazed, watches as the Beast raises the claw hammer
      high to slam down on Marie.  Nick grabs for his gun, aiming
      as the beast brings the claw hammer down.  Nick fires.

      The bullet tears into the beast's neck.  Causing him to twist
      in pain.  He turns, glares at Nick.  And comes for him. 
      Nick continues to fire, emptying his gun.  Bullets tear into
      the beast who continues toward Nick.

      Finally collapsing at Nick's feet.

      Nick scrambles to his feet, moves to the creature, staring
      down in horror at the hideous troll.  He watches in utter
      shock as the troll's features MORPH into the middle aged man
      with the comb-over who was driving the GREEN CORVETTE.

      Nothing menacing about him at all.  He struggles for breath,
      then dies.

      Marie groans.  Nick turns.  She is on the ground, badly
      injured.  Nick runs to her as --

30EXT. SMALL VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT30

      Having heard the gunshots, Juliette runs out of the house.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Nick!                                                                                      15.

      She sees Nick kneeling beside Marie down the street in a
      pool of light.

31EXT. OLD NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT31

      Juliette runs to them, stunned to see the body of a man on
      the ground.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Oh my god!

                            Juliette)
                    Call 911!

      Juliette calls as Nick cradles Marie.  She looks up weakly.

                                      MARIE
                    Did you get... Mr. Hulda...?*

                                    NICK
                      I don't... I shot something, but...

                                      MARIE
                    That was him.  I'm so sorry, Nick,
                    he was following me, I thought I
                    lost him.  I'm so sorry for what's
                    going to happen to you...

      She stares up at Nick, losing consciousness.

      High shot looking down on Marie in Nick's arms and Juliette
      on the phone, all in the pool of street lamp light.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

33SAME ANGLE, LATER33*

      POLICE on scene.  Ambulance.  Cops tape off the crime scene. 
      Hank with them.  Police PHOTOGRAPHER shoots photos of Mr.
      Hulda dead on the ground.  NEIGHBORS gawk from the perimeter.*

      Juliette, very upset, is being interviewed by an OFFICER.

                                      JULIETTE
                    I didn't see what happened.  I heard
                    gunshots and I ran out of the house.

      She looks at the PARAMEDICS who are lifting Marie onto a
      gurney.  Nick and Hank move with them as they load her into
      the back of the ambulance.                                                                                      16.

                                    NICK
                    He came out of nowhere and he had
                    that thing in his hand... he went
                    right for her, Hank, I had no choice.

                                    HANK
                    Take it easy.  You go to the hospital,
                    I'll handle this.

                                    NICK
                    She said she knew him.  That his
                    name was Hulda.*

      Hank glances at Hulda on the ground.  With his business suit*
      and comb-over, Hulda looks like a mild mannered accountant.*

                                    HANK
                    I'll run his prints.

      Juliette moves up.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Do you want me to come with you?

                                    NICK
                    Stay here, I'll be home as soon as I
                    can.

                                      JULIETTE
                    I love you.

      Nick hugs Juliette and gets into the back of the ambulance,
      the doors close and the ambulance takes off, siren blasting.

34INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT34

      Nick is seated, absentmindedly doodling in his police
      notebook.  He pauses and stares at what he's been drawing,
      surprised to discover --

      His drawing looks remarkably like the TROLL version of Mr.
      Hulda.  He rips it out, crumples it up and throws it away as*
      a young FEMALE DOCTOR enters.

                                      DOCTOR LEVY
                    She's conscious now.  You can see
                    her for a few minutes but then I'll
                    need to run some tests.

35INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT35

      Nick enters.  Marie is hooked up to I.V. and monitors.  She
      looks up weakly.

                                      MARIE
                    God I'm sick of hospitals.                                                                                      17.

      He moves up, takes her hand.

                                      MARIE (CONT'D)
                    You saw him, didn't you.  You saw
                    who Mr. Hulda really was.*

                                    NICK
                    I don't know what I saw, I don't
                    know what's happening.

                                      MARIE
                    That's why I came.  I knew the
                      transition was starting.

                                    NICK
                    I don't understand...

                                      MARIE
                    We have the ability to see what others
                    can't.  When they lose control, they*
                    can't hide, we see them for who they*
                    are.  The stories are real.  What*
                    they wrote really happened.  You're*
                    one of the last descendants. 

                                    NICK
                    This isn't possible.

                                      MARIE
                    We didn't move all the time because
                    of my job, we moved because we had
                    to.  I know it's a lot and I wish I
                    had more time, but everything is in
                    my trailer.  Sweetie, there's so
                    much you still don't know...
                          (caresses his cheek)
                    I love you, if there's a way I could
                    have stopped this I would have...
                    but none of us have ever been able
                    to escape it... you're vulnerable
                    now, you have to be careful...

      Marie suddenly stops, HEARING a NOISE in the hallway.  She
      turns, watches a couple of ORDERLIES run past with a CRASH*
      CART. She turns back to Nick, pulling him even closer.*

                                      MARIE (CONT'D)
                          (lowers her voice)
                    Your parents didn't die in the
                    crash...

                                    NICK
                    Marie, you need to rest --

                                      MARIE
                    -- they were murdered.                                                                                      18.*

      She presses something into his hand, a small, circular crystal*
      in the shape of a CAT'S EYE with a bright green center.  *

      Nick stares at Marie in disbelief.*

                                      MARIE (CONT'D)*
                    Don't ever lose it.  If you do --*

      Doctor Levy enters, interrupting Marie.*

                                      DOCTOR LEVY
                    Sorry Mr. Burckhardt...

      Nick looks at Marie, so many unanswered questions.

                                      DOCTOR LEVY (CONT'D)
                    You can see her again tomorrow.

        Reluctantly, Nick exits.

36INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT36

      Nick walks down the long hallway, emotions churning, hears a*
      COMMOTION in a room as he passes.*

      Nick's POV of the orderlies with the crash cart and a doctor*
      trying to revive a patient under cardiac arrest.*

                                      DOCTOR*
                    Clear!*

      Electricity JOLTS through the body of the patient and for a*
      moment Nick sees GREEN SKIN, BULGING EYES, HUGE WARTS - the*
      face of a frog. *

      Off Nick --*

                                      END OF ACT ONE*                                                                                      19.

                                          ACT TWO

37INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT37*

      Nick, emotionally drained, is on the other side of the table
      from two DETECTIVES in suits.

                                    NICK
                    We were attacked from behind.  I
                    tried to stop him, but he knocked me
                    down and went after my aunt.  I pulled
                    my weapon and fired.  I hit him in
                    the neck.  It should have dropped
                    him but it didn't.  He came at me.

                                      DETECTIVE # 1
                    Then you shot him again.

                                    NICK
                    Yes.

                                      DETECTIVE # 2
                    You emptied your clip.

                                    NICK
                    I did what was necessary under the
                      circumstances.

                                      DETECTIVE # 2
                    Do you know what the relationship
                    was between your aunt and this Mr.
                    Hulda?*

                                    NICK
                    ...all I know is she recognized him.

                                      DETECTIVE # 1
                    But you'd never seen him before
                    tonight.

                                    NICK
                    No.

                                      DETECTIVE # 2
                    And she'd never mentioned him before?

                                    NICK
                    No.

      KNOCK on the door.  Hank peers in.

                                    HANK
                          (to detectives)
                    Sorry to bother you guys, but I got
                    a line on Hulda.  Turns out he's*
                    from Boise, Idaho.  Worked there as
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      20.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    an accountant three years ago.  But
                    when I ran his prints, it came back
                    as a Mr. Lindo, who lived in Chicago
                    and was wanted for assault, rape and
                    murder.  There's also warrants
                    matching those prints in Florida and
                    Alabama, under the name Roberts.

      Lets that sink in.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Captain wants to see him.  You good?

                                      DETECTIVE # 1
                    Yeah, good for now.

      Hank and Nick exit, head towards their desks.

                                    NICK
                    He was wanted for assault, rape and
                    murder?

                                    HANK
                    Don't let the comb-over throw you,
                    this was a bad guy...

      They've arrived at the Captain's office.*

                                    NICK
                    Am I in trouble?

                                    HANK
                    Guess you'll find out.

38INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT38

      CAPTAIN ERICSON, 50, is behind his desk studying Hulda's*
      file folder, wanted posters, etc. Nick enters.  Hank stays
      out, pulling the door shut.

                                    NICK
                    You wanted to see me sir?

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                          (looks up)
                    If you had to shoot somebody, you
                    sure picked the right guy.  I just
                    got off the phone with the F.B.I.
                    There were seventeen warrants out on
                    him.  How you doin', you holding up?

                                    NICK
                    Yes sir.                                                                                      21.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    First shooting is no small thing. 
                    You'll be required to see the police
                      psychologist.*

                                    NICK
                    Okay.

      Ericson eyes Nick for a moment, trying to read his mental
      state.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    Make sure you do.

      Nick exits.

39EXT. SMALL VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT39

      A UNIFORM stands on the front porch as Nick drives up.  Nick
      heads for the front door.

                                    NICK
                          (to cop)
                    Thanks for staying with her.

      Cop nods, moves off as Nick lets himself in.

40INT. NICK'S VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT40

      Nick sees Juliette across the room.  She crosses to him,
      goes into his arms.

                                    NICK
                    You okay?

                                      JULIETTE
                    Yeah, I'm fine.  How's Marie?

                                    NICK
                    As well as can be expected I guess.

                                      JULIETTE
                    How 'bout you?

                                    NICK
                    I don't know... I'm too tired to
                    know.

      They just cling to each other.

41INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT41

      Juliette is asleep in Nick's arms.  He's staring at the
      ceiling.  He looks over at her, carefully disengages himself
      without waking her, goes to the window and looks out at the
      trailer parked in the back yard.                                                                                      22.*

42INT. MARIE'S TRAILER - NIGHT42

      The door opens, Nick enters, looks at the amazing, tricked*
      out interior hidden from prying eyes by the brightly colored*
      curtains.  Bedroom, kitchen, living room area.  Shelves of*
      books and vials filled with strange objects and colorful*
      liquids.  A couple of them have the skull and crossbones on*
      them.  Nearby are some very oddly shaped skulls, not quite*
      human, not quite animal.  The trailer is an odd cross between*
      a library and a laboratory. 

      Nick opens a cabinet.  Full of unusual weapons, cross bow,*
      short sword, black jack, cat o'nine tails, and a few things*
      we have no names for.

      On a table is a large open portfolio-sized book, handwritten*
      words scrawled across one page, on the opposite page sketches
      of a beautiful looking woman, next to her in the same
      clothing, a hideous looking witch-like CRONE.

      Neatly printed beneath each drawing are the important stats: 
      DOB, WT, HT, LAST KNOWN RESIDENCE, ETC. Almost like a police
      report.  He flips through the book, revealing page after
      page with various humans opposite their fairy tale creature
        counterpart.  Each with the STATS listed below.

      Behind a cushion Nick finds a WORK IN PROGRESS -- another*
      sketching: Mr. Hulda in his human form and Mr. Hulda as the*
      grotesque troll-like monster that attacked him.

      Nick stares hard at Hulda.  Then he notices on the table an*
      odd sculpture -- the face of a black cat with a wide open*
      mouth, one closed eye and one empty eye socket.  Nick stares*
      at the cat face, then suddenly reaches into his pocked and*
      pulls out the crystal cat's eye that Marie gave him.  It*
      looks to be about the right size for the empty eye socket.*

      He very tentatively reaches forward and places the cat's eye*
      in the socket.  Doesn't quite fit.  He puts his thumb on the*
      eyeball and pushes down.  It CLICKS into place.  And the*
      wide open mouth slowly begins to fill with a glowing liquid.*

                                      NICK*
                    What the hell...*

      The cat's mouth fills with liquid and in the liquid Nick*
      sees a vision start to coalesce.  He leans closer, he's seeing*
      some kind of warrior fighting a mythical beast.  The warrior*
      is a woman, wielding a sword in one hand and a multi-bladed*
      dagger in the other.  Nick is fascinated by what he's seeing. *
      Almost as if he's watching some strange video game.  The*
      female warrior destroys the beast, lopping off its head with*
      her sword.  For the first time she turns towards us and we*
      realize we are watching Marie, younger by twenty years. *
      She's about to speak, to whoever might be watching, when --*

      Suddenly the trailer door is flung open behind him.*                                                                                      23.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    Ahh!

      Startled, Nick spins, knocking into the table -- the cat*
      face falls to the floor --*

      THE EYE dislodges and rolls under the table.  The eye rolls*
      to a stop and MAGICALLY VANISHES from SIGHT.*

      Expecting the worst, Nick sees Juliette in her robe and*
      slippers in the doorway.

                                      JULIETTE
                    How long have you been down here?

                                    NICK
                      I couldn't sleep.

      She looks around at the interior.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)*
                    I'm sorry, let's go back to bed.*

      Trying to keep her from seeing anything, Nick moves to the*
      door and hustles her out.*

                                      JULIETTE*
                    What is all that stuff?*

                                      NICK*
                    I don't know, I'll deal with it later. *

43EXT. SMALL VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT43

      They head back to the house.

                                    NICK
                    I still can't believe any of this is
                      happening...

                                      JULIETTE
                    How long did you live with your aunt?

                                    NICK
                    She was my mother from the time I
                    was twelve.

                                      JULIETTE
                    After your parents died...

                                    NICK
                    Yeah...

      She takes his hand as they walk up the steps to the house
      and are about to enter when -- a STRANGE ANIMALISTIC SOUND
      comes from behind.  Nick spins, not knowing what to expect. 
      Something moves in the trees and is gone.                                                                                      24.

      Juliette looks at him, concerned.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Nick?  It was just a cat.

      As they go inside, the trees wave in the wind.  In the shadowy*
      moonlit darkness one of the trees looks almost like a*
      creature. *

44INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - ROBBERY HOMICIDE - DAY44*

      Hank is on the phone.

                                    HANK
                    Send me the picture, I need a*
                      picture... now would be better.*

      Hank hangs up as Nick approaches, envelope in hand,*

                                      NICK*
                    Take a look at the lab report, DNA
                    of the attacker is inconclusive. 
                    Still don't know if we're lookin'
                    for man or beast.

      Hank pulls a photo out of the printer.*

                                    HANK
                    Well we got a lead if it wears boots.*

      Shows PHOTO of a HIKING BOOT to Nick.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Based on the plaster cast, this is
                    the boot we're lookin' for.

45EXT. STREET - DAY45

      A PAIR OF THE BOOTS "we're looking for" walk down the street
      The boots are SPATTERED with something that looks like paint
      but could be dried blood.  They move past a white picket
      fence, stop at a mail box.  A HAND reaches into the mailbag
      and deposits a few letters inside the box.

      This fine fellow will be known as the POSTMAN.  We don't see
      his face.  But we see his standard issue U.S. postal uniform,
      and his heavy bag.

      And OVER HIS SHOULDER we SEE the cute little girl in the red
      hoody (ROBIN HOWELL, 9) walking past, school backpack on her*
      shoulders.

      She moves past.  For a moment the Postman is motionless. 
      Then his HAND suddenly SNAPS the mailbox door closed.                                                                                      25.

      The BOOTS CHANGE direction, following the little girl.  We
      HEAR him humming a familiar tune.  "Once Upon A Time In Your
      Wildest Dreams".

46INT. SHOE STORE - DAY46*

      CLOSE ON BOOTS in Nick's hands.  A nice new pair.  Exact
      match for the ones we saw on the Postman.

      Nick and Hank face the STORE MANAGER who is referring to
      data on his iPad.

                                      MANAGER
                    ... we sold forty-two pair in the*
                    last six months, you're looking for*
                    size ten... we sold a dozen.

                                    NICK
                    You keep a data base on customers?

                                      MANAGER
                    On credit cards, yes, but not on
                    cash transactions.

                                    HANK
                    We'll take what you got.

                                      MANAGER
                    We're not the only store in town
                    that sells these, you know.

                                    HANK
                          (referring to his
                            list)
                    Yeah, we know.

      Nick's cell RINGS.  He moves off to answer.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Can you print us out a list?

                                      MANAGER
                    Yeah, but don't you need a warrant
                    or something?

                                    HANK
                    If I needed a warrant, I'd have a
                    warrant.  Don't ya' think?

      Manager moves off.  Hank looks to Nick on his cell.  Nick
      hangs up.

                                    NICK
                    I gotta go to the hospital.  Marie's
                    in a coma.                                                                                      26.

47INT. HOSPITAL - DAY47

      Nick walks down a hall with Doctor Levy.

                                      DOCTOR LEVY
                    About an hour ago the nurse went to
                    check on her and discovered she
                    couldn't wake her.  There was a sudden
                    spike at ten thirty this morning on
                    the EKG.  We're still examining that
                    event, but I have nothing definitive
                    to tell you right now.  We've moved
                    her to I.C.U. and she's stable.

      Dr. Levy leads Nick to the I.C.U unit.  Through the window
      we can see Marie, oxygen mask over her face in the I.C.U.,
      tubed and monitored.

                                    NICK
                    Is there anyway to know if she'll
                    come out of this?

                                    DR. LEVY
                    All we can do is wait... did you
                    know about the scars?

                                    NICK
                    What scars?

48INT. I.C.U. UNIT - DAY48

      Dr. Levy pulls aside the sheet, revealing Marie's body. 
      Scars of all sizes and shapes.

                                    DR. LEVY
                    A lot of these look like knife wounds.

      Dr. Levy looks up at Nick who is stunned.

                                    DR. LEVY (CONT'D)
                    What line of work was she in?

                                    NICK
                    She was a... librarian.

      Nick just stares down at Marie and the scars.  There's so
      much he didn't know.*

49EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY49*

      Nick walks with Hank towards their car.

                                    HANK
                    Is she any better?

                                    NICK
                    Not really.                                                                                      27.*

                                    HANK
                    People pull out of comas.

      Suddenly their cell phones start ringing.  They both answer.*

                    NICKHANK
          Hello.Yeah...

      They turn and look at each other.

                                    NICK
                      Kidnapping.

                                    HANK
                    Four seven three Ravenswood, got it.*

      They both hang up and start running for the car.

50EXT. ROBIN HOWELL'S HOUSE - DAY50*

      Cops cars in front, police lights on, cops everywhere,
      whatever this is, it's big.  Neighbors are being kept back.

      Nick and Hank make their way to the porch where a MOTHER is
      crying hard, GRANDFATHER is with her.  He's in his sixties,*
      flowing white hair, beard.  A little unkempt.*

                                      MOTHER
                    ...she was supposed to go straight
                    there from school...*

                                      GRANDFATHER
                    She never showed up.  I looked all
                    over the neighborhood, then I came
                    right here.  YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT
                    THERE, YOU'VE GOT TO FIND HER!

      Sgt. Blaknikoff approaches Hank and Nick, photo in hand.

                                    HANK
                    What do we know.

                                      SERGEANT BLAKNIKOFF
                    Little girl on her way to her*
                      grandfather's house never showed up.*
                          (re: white haired man)*
                    That's him, guy with the beard.*

                                      NICK*
                    Do we think he's clean?*

                                      SERGEANT BLAKNIKOFF*
                    We're looking into that. *
                          (holds up photo)*
                    This is the best photo they had.*                                                                                      28.

      CLOSE ON PHOTO - ROBIN HOWELL, the little girl we saw the*
      Postman go after, wearing her red school sweatshirt.  Smiling. 
      Long hair in pigtails.

      PULL BACK FROM PHOTO WHICH IS NOW PROJECTED ON A WALL IN:

51INT. POLICE STATION - TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY51

      Room full of cops, including Nick and Hank.  Captain Ericson
      is running the kidnap task force.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    She's missing now for four hours and
                    fifteen minutes.  We don't know what
                    we got, pedophile, ransom, but we
                    know we gotta move fast.

      A MAP is now projected on the wall, showing the Robin Howell's*
      usual route from school to grandpa's house.*

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON (CONT'D)
                    We split into teams.  Section off
                    the path she would have taken from
                    school.*
                          (pointing at map)
                    It's a mile and four tenths from
                    school to the house.
                          (turns back to cops)
                    Make sure you have copies of the
                    photo and the map.  You all know
                    your sections, let's get out there.

      Cops hustle out.  Nick stops in front of Capt. Ericson.

                                    NICK
                    Captain, the university student was
                    wearing a red sweatshirt with a hood
                    when she was attacked.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    The one that was torn to pieces?

                                    HANK
                    Yeah.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    Then let's hope it's not the same
                    guy.

52EXT. STREET - DAY52

      A mail truck blows past kicking up the fall leaves on the
      beautiful sunny day.

53INT. MAIL TRUCK - DAY53

      The blood-spattered boot on the pedal is a familiar one.                                                                                      29.

      In the BACK OF THE TRUCK, several large mail bags on the
      floor.  All empty except for one.  The one that's kicking
      and moving.  We HEAR a muffled WHIMPER.

54EXT. PORTLAND STREET - DAY54

      CLOSE ON MAP.  Hank and Nick move down the sidewalk, following
      Robin Howell's route.  As they cross the street:*

                                    NICK
                    She's supposed to cross Hunter lane
                    here, then go around the park to
                      Hildabrand.

      They stop.  Looking at the park.

                                    HANK
                    The old man's house is on the other*
                    side of the park, right?

                                    NICK
                          (re: map)
                    Right.  4753 Hildebrand Road. 
                    Directly across from here.

                                    HANK
                    When I was a kid I wouldn't have
                    gone all the way around the park.

                                    NICK
                    Her mom was very specific about the
                    route.

                                    HANK
                    Yeah, right, kids always do what
                    their moms tell 'em.  I know I did.

      They both head for the park.

55EXT. PARK - DAY55

      The old park is a little wild.  Large old trees cast long
      shadows over the grounds.  Patches of wild flowers and thick
      ferns.  A place you could get lost in.  Several paths criss-
      cross through.

      An old wishing well can be seen among the ferns.  A wooden
      bridge arches over a small creek.

      Nick and Hank move through the park.  It's a little spooky. 
      One of the trails leads through a darker part.

                                    NICK
                    I'll take this trail.

      Hank nods, Nick moves down the trial as Hank moves off the
      beaten path into a more forested part.                                                                                      30.

      HANK - Studies the ground, stops when he sees a broken branch,
      moves off in that direction.

      NICK - moves slowly down the path checking both sides.

      HANK - continues through the forest, sees a bright color
      amidst all the green.  He moves toward it.

      NICK - comes out the far side of the park.  He refers to the
      map, looks across the street at 4753 HILDABRAND ROAD carved
      on a wooden sign over the entrance to Grandpa's house.  A
      classic Craftsman's cottage in need of a few repairs, perched
      on a little rise.

                                    HANK (O.S.)
                    NICK!  GOT SOMETHING!

      Nick turns and runs back towards the sound of Hank's voice.

      Nick runs through the woods to discover HANK kneeling down
      next to something on the ground -- A YOUNG GIRL'S BRIGHTLY
      COLORED SCHOOL BACK PACK, partially covered by brush.  Hank
      points out the RH drawn on the backpack with a sharpie.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Robin Howell.*

                                    NICK
                    She must have been grabbed somewhere
                    in this area.

                                    HANK
                    Be careful where you step.

      Hank gets on his cell as Nick searches the area.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                          (into cell)
                    We got a crime scene in Korbes Park.*

      NICK - pushes through some bushes with broken branches.  In
      open ground beyond he sees some drag marks -- AND A COUPLE
      OF FAMILIAR BOOT PRINTS.

                                    NICK
                          (calling back to Hank)
                    Hank, I got boot prints over here,
                    it's the same guy, he took her this
                    way!

      Nick moves quickly through the bushes which open out to a
      grassy area.

      Cute houses line the shady street on the other side.

      Nick looks up and down the street, trail suddenly cold. 
      Nothing.  No one in sight.                                                                                      31.

      Then he hears a screen door SLAM, turns to look.

      A MAN in his 30's, cardigan sweater, walks towards his
      mailbox.  His classic VW bug parked out front.

      Hank moves up behind Nick.

                                    HANK
                    They're on their way.

      Hank sees some PEOPLE crossing the grassy area into the park. 
      He moves to them, flashing his badge.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Sorry folks, we have crime scene,
                    you're not going to be able to go in
                    the park right now.

      As Hank is badging them, Nick is watching THREE YOUNG GIRLS
      ON BICYCLES riding past.  He watches them as they cross in
      front of the GUY picking up his mail.

      GUY - glances at young girls.

      NICK - sees the guy suddenly MORPH for into wolf-like
      features.  Then back to normal again.

      Nick and Guy lock eyes for a moment.  Chilling.  Guy turns
      away, walking briskly back to his house.

                                    NICK
                    I got him... I GOT HIM!  HANK!

      Hank turns and sees --

      Nick suddenly sprinting across the street.

      Hank tears after him.

      GUY - looks back, sees Nick and Hank running toward him. 
      Guy turns and quickly enters his house.  Shutting the door
      just as Nick slams into it, knocking him back.

56INT. HOUSE56

      Nick takes the man to the floor as Hank comes in behind, gun
      drawn.  The guy tries to get up, Nick slams him down.

                                    NICK
                    Don't move!

      Nick whips out handcuffs, slapping them on the guy.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    Where is she?!  WHERE IS SHE?!

      Guy looks up, terrified.  By the way, his name is EDDY MONROE.                                                                                      32.

                                        ACT THREE

57EXT. EDDY MONROE'S HOUSE - DAY57

      Crawling with COPS.  Police cars, etc.

58INT. EDDY MONROE'S HOUSE - DAY58

      Also crawling with cops, searching every square inch:

      INSIDE THE ATTIC -- flashlights sweep over the dusty cobwebs,
      trunks are opened, contents strewn about.

      BEDROOMS - are searched.

      GARAGE - ditto.

59INT. EDDY MONROE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY59

      Nick tears apart a closet, clothes are already strewn
      everywhere but Nick's looking for the boots.

      He throws a pair of boots aside, wrong kind.

60INT. EDDY MONROE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY60

      Nick enters, frustrated.  Cops pry open a chest.  Empty.

                                    NICK
                    I know she's here somewhere.

                                      SERGEANT BLAKNIKOFF
                    If you got another place to look,
                    we'll look.  But we've torn this
                    place apart.

      Hank grabs Nick by the arm and pulling him outside.

                                    HANK
                    What are we doin' here?

61EXT. EDDY MONROE'S HOUSE - DAY61

      Nick yanks his arm away from Hank's grip.

                                    NICK
                    If she's not in there, he's got her
                    someplace else.

                                    HANK
                    Take it easy, Nick.  What d'ya see
                    in this guy that we don't?

      Nick looks over at --

      Eddy Monroe sitting in the back of a patrol car.  Staring
      back at him.                                                                                      34.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    He's got no priors, he's completely
                    clean.

                                    NICK
                    The way he looked at those girls on
                    the bikes.

                                    HANK
                    Jesus, Nick.  That all you got?

                                    NICK
                          (defending himself)
                    No, no, he does fit the profile,
                    he's a loner, never been married,
                    lives across the street from a park...

                                    HANK
                    You can't profile a guy on gut
                    instinct alone.
                          (puts finger in Nick's
                            chest)
                    That doesn't get him into a court --
                    unless he sues our ass.

      Unsure, Nick looks back at Monroe.

62INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT62

      Hank stands next to Nick facing --

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    With the attack on your Aunt and the
                    shooting, you've been under a lot of
                    pressure.  It's probably my fault
                    for not giving you some time off.*

                                    NICK
                    I thought I had him.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    I know you did, but it cost us a lot
                    of resources and valuable time, we
                    can't afford to make mistakes right
                    now.  Look, all I want you to do is
                    forget about this, go home and get a
                    good night's sleep.
                          (to Hank)
                    Okay.

                                    HANK
                    Copy that.

63EXT. MAIL YARD - NIGHT63

      The mail truck pulls in, parks next to a long row of other
      mail trucks.  It's late, the yard is deserted.                                                                                      35.*

64INT. BACK OF MAIL TRUCK64

      Door opens, hands reach in, grab the bulky mailbag, we hear
      a MUFFLED SCREAM as the hands drag the mail bag out.  The
      door slams shut.

65EXT. SMALL VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT65

      Full moon on the rise.

66INT. SMALL VICTORIAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT66

      Juliette, hair wet, towel wrapped around her, changes into
      her bedclothes.  She HEARS a car drive up, moves to the*
      window.*

      Sees Nick getting out of his car.  But instead of coming to*
      the house, he heads for the trailer.  Puzzled, she watches*
      him enter the trailer.*

67INT. TRAILER - NIGHT67*

      Door opens, Nick enters.  He goes right to the cat sculpture*
      on the floor.  But the crystal cat's eye is missing.  He*
      gets down on his hands and knees, searching the floor for*
      it.  He can't find it anywhere.  He suddenly gets up.*

68INT. NICK'S VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT68*

      Juliette comes down the stairs as Nick enters, one of Marie's
      large portfolios in one hand, and the cat faced sculpture in*
      the other.*

                                      JULIETTE
                    Hi, honey.

      She sees the serious look on his face.

                                      JULIETTE (CONT'D)
                    What's wrong?

                                    NICK
                    We're gonna need something to drink.

69INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER69

      Marie's PORTFOLIO is on the table next to an empty bottle of
      wine.  Juliette holds her nearly empty glass, staring at
      Nick who is holding the cat sculpture.  Nick is amped and*
      frazzled, as he tries to explain --*

                                      NICK*
                    ...and then I put the eye in and it*
                    filled with some kind of glowing*
                    liquid and then I could see this*
                    woman warrior fighting a sort of*
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      36.*

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                      beast/thing.  And she killed it and*
                    she turned and it was Marie.

                                      JULIETTE*
                    Your aunt?*

                                      NICK*
                    Yes.  Only she was a lot younger,*
                    like when she was taking care of me.*

                                      JULIETTE*
                    Okaayyy.  So why don't you put the*
                    eye in now so I can see... what you*
                    saw.*

                                      NICK*
                    I would, that's what I was going to*
                    do, but I couldn't find it.*

                                      JULIETTE*
                    Nick, you're not making sense.

                                    NICK
                    Because it doesn't make sense.  All*
                    right forget the cat and the eye,*
                    look at the book.*

      Nick flips through the book.*

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    The man I shot was not a man.*

                                      JULIETTE
                    I saw him.  The police saw him.*

      Nick finds the page with Hulda's drawing on it.*

                                      NICK*
                          (re: troll)
                    This is what I shot.

      She stares at the sketch of the troll like figure.

                                      JULIETTE
                    You were upset, the mind can really
                    twist up reality --

                                    NICK
                    It wasn't like that.  I know what I
                    saw.  And he's not the only one.

                                      JULIETTE
                          (beat)
                    What do you mean he's not the only
                    one...?                                                                                      37.*

                    I saw this beautiful young woman
                    turn into a, I don't know, an old...*
                    like hag.  And then there was this
                    guy in the police station, under
                    arrest, and he looked at me and he
                    had a face that looked like an owl.

                                      JULIETTE
                          (evenly)
                    Somebody arrested an owl?

                                    NICK
                    I know how this sounds, Juli, I know
                    what you must be thinking.  I'm not*
                    going to even get into the frog guy. *
                    You must be thinking I'm absolutely*
                    out of my mind crazy.  How do you*
                    think I feel telling you this stuff?! *
                    I don't want to tell this to anybody,*
                    but I have to tell you.  You're the*
                    only one I can trust.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Nick, sit down, look at me.

      Nick stares at her for a moment, then sits.*

                                      JULIETTE (CONT'D)*
                    Your Aunt was almost killed, and you*
                    shot the man who attacked her --
                          (re: book)
                    Then you found all her strange
                    drawings, and this cat thing, I mean,*
                    no wonder you're having trouble making*
                    sense of it all.  Sometimes things*
                    don't make sense.  Your aunt is sick,*
                    dying and delusional.*

      They both stare at each other.  He looks back down at the*
      book, frustrated.*

                                      JULIETTE (CONT'D)
                    Remember when my mom died?  I couldn't
                    get out of bed, I couldn't think
                    straight, I couldn't sleep, I was
                    putting the milk in the dryer.
                          (beat)
                    I never told you this but... I thought
                    I saw her -- more than once.  And it
                    really freaked me out.  You haven't
                    slept in two days.
                          (gets up)
                    I think it's time we stopped talking
                    so you can get some rest.
                          (takes his hand)
                    I love you.                                                                                      38.

      Nick takes her hand; she pulls him up.  They stare at each
      other for a moment.

                                    NICK
                    I love you, too.

                                      JULIETTE
                    It's gonna be okay.

      He nods but he's not feeling any better.  As they head
      upstairs, CAMERA PUSHES IN ON one of the scarier drawings. 
      Half man, half wolf CREATURES.

                                      JULIETTE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Marie's drawings are just things she
                    imagined.  They were in her head. 
                    They're not real.

70INT. NICK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT70*

      Juliette is asleep in bed.  Alone.  PAN TO NICK dressed in*
      black, watching her.  He quietly slips out.*

71EXT. EDDY MONROE'S HOUSE - NIGHT71*

      Eddy Monroe can be seen inside eating from a can of barbecued
      baked beans.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL - NICK in dark sweatshirt, jeans, is
      outside, watching Monroe.  Nick's car is parked in b.g.

      Nick's PHONE vibrates, he pulls it out, sees the name JULIETTE
      and her PHOTO smiling up at him.

      He hesitates.

      Then he HEARS the back door OPEN and CLOSE.  He hits IGNORE
      CALL, moves quickly around the side of the house.  Looking
      into the backyard.  Stops.  Pulls back.  As he sees --

72EXT. MONROE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT72

      Monroe walks to his back fence line and, incredibly, starts
      to take a leak on it.

      Nick flattens himself against the side of the house watching --

      Monroe pisses along the back fence line.  Monroe zips up,
      returns to the back door, hesitates, sniffs the night air,
      then enters.  Lights go off inside the house.

      Nick waits a moment, creeps along the wall passing a window
      WHICH SUDDENLY EXPLODES as Monroe leaps through it and attacks
      Nick.  Scaring the shit out of him.  Nick looks up at Monroe
      who is in FULL WOLF FACE now.  Nick tries to get up,
      Monroe/Wolf picks him up and flings him against the house.                                                                                      39.

                          (closing in)
                    Shouldn't a come back.

      Nick desperately reaches for his gun.  Monroe MORPHS BACK to
      his human self.  And smiles.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    Oh come on, get real, I was just
                    makin' a point.  Let's grab a brew
                          (starts back towards
                            house)
                    And by the way, you're payin' for
                    that window.

      Off Nick,

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                      40.

                                            ACT FOUR

73INT. MONROE'S HOUSE - NIGHT73

      Monroe pulls a couple a beers from the fridge, hands one to
      Nick who is still shook up, has no idea what to expect now.

      Monroe stares hard at Nick, then:

                                      MONROE

      Monroe picks up a chair knocked over by the cops.

                    Right now.                                                                                      44.

                    Don't threaten me.*

      Nick suddenly grabs Monroe and shoves him against the wall.*

                                      NICK*
                    I want to know who's got her!*

                                      MONROE*
                    You know I tried to be friendly here,
                    gave you a beer -- I could've broken
                    your back, easily, like that.
                          (snaps fingers)
                    Now you're gonna go all Wolverine on
                    me?

                                      NICK*
                    I'm asking you to save a little girl's
                    life.*

                                      MONROE*
                    You do not understand what you're*
                    asking me to do!*

      Nick tightens his grip on Monroe.*

                                    NICK
                    Who's got her.

75EXT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT75

      CLOSE - ON A FAMILIAR LICENSE PLATE -- it reads SMILE1 and
      it's moving.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bright YELLOW VAN which we saw in
      the very beginning.  The VAN moves past some run down houses,
      a trailer park named MILLPOND GLEN; the van turns on a narrow
      dirt road, crosses a rickety old bridge, leaving civilization
      behind and heads into the woods.

76EXT. WOODS/RUN DOWN OLD COTTAGE - NIGHT76

      Ramshackle old timber frame.  The van pulls to a stop and
      the POSTMAN gets out.  Humming the now familiar tune, "Once
      Upon a Time in Your Wildest Dreams".

      We get our first look at him.  A thoroughly average looking
      guy in his forties.  He unlocks the back of the van, picks
      up the large mail sack, hefts it over his shoulder and heads
      for the house.  We HEAR some WHIMPERING from inside the bag.

77INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT77

      The Postman enters the dark house.  Flicks on a light.  The
      home is surprisingly cheery, neat and tidy; window treatments,
      throw rugs, puffy pillows on the furniture.  An astoundingly
      large collection of Hummel figurines line the shelves.                                                                                      45.

      Postman pushes aside a table careful not to knock over the
      vase of fresh flowers; he pulls aside a throw rug, revealing
      a trap door.

78INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT78

      The trap door opens.  Postman carries the sack down the trap
      door stairs, flicks on a light.

      Once again we are surprised to discover a charming little
      girl's room with a canopied bed, a dresser, side tables,
      somewhat Germanic.

      Continuing to HUM, the Postman puts the bag on the bed, unties
      it and dumps Robin out of it, surprisingly gently.  She's*
      wearing her red hoodie.  She's terrified.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Don't be afraid.
                          (re: bedroom)
                    Do you like it?  It's all yours. 
                      Everything in it.

      He lifts a lid on a small chest.  Full of candy and dolls.

                                      POSTMAN (CONT'D)
                    You must like candy.

                                      ROBIN*
                    Please, I just want to go home.

                                      POSTMAN
                    You are home.
                          (re: hoody)
                    What do you say we hang this up.

      He takes off her red hoody.  Whistling the TUNE, he goes to
      a wooden armoire, adorned with hand-carved bears.  Opens the
      doors.

      We see several other RED HOODIES, many of them ripped and
      torn.  He stares at them and closes the door.

                                      POSTMAN (CONT'D)
                    Want a chicken pot pie?

      He takes the mail bag and goes back up the stairs.

      ROBIN - watches him go.  And shut the trap door behind him. *
      Off her helpless expression,

                                    END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                      46.

                                            ACT FIVE

79EXT. TWO LANE FORESTED ROAD - NIGHT79

      HEADLIGHTS move down the highway, swerving a little.  Forest
      on either side.

80INT. MONROE'S VOLKSWAGEN BUG - NIGHT80

      Monroe drives, his window down, his head halfway out.  Nick
      sits next to him, glancing over at Monroe.

                                    NICK
                    I really think I should drive.

                                      MONROE
                    I'm good.

      Monroe takes a deep breath, sucking in the night air.

                                    NICK
                    If it's the same guy, or Blutbad
                    that killed the woman in the woods...

                                      MONROE
                    I know where you're goin'.  If he
                    fed yesterday morning he's good for
                    a week, ten days tops.  He'll use
                    this time to fatten her up.
                          (sniffs suddenly)
                    WHOA WHOA, got a hit.

      Monroe pulls his head back in.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    We're close.

                                    NICK
                    You can really smell him?

                                      MONROE
                    Dude, you have no idea.

81INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT81

      Postman pulls off his boots, hesitates, staring at the dried
      blood on them.

82EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT82

      The volkswagen pulls past the MILLPOND GLEN trailer court,
      filled with older trailers, overgrown trees; Monroe still
      has his head out the window, nose to the night air.

      He stops the car at the beginning of the rickety bridge. 
      The same bridge we saw the Postman drive over.                                                                                      47.

                                      MONROE
                    This is as far as we drive.

      They get out.

                                    NICK
                    Why?

                                      MONROE
                    He'll hear us, why do you think.

      Monroe stares at the bridge.

                                    NICK
                    He's on the other side?

                                      MONROE
                          (nods)
                    Oh he's real close.

      Monroe opens the trunk of the car.  Pulls out a baggie.

                                    NICK
                    What are you gonna do, roll a joint?!

                                      MONROE
                      Wolfsbane.  So he won't scent us.

      Monroe rubs some wolfsbane on himself, tosses the baggie to
      Nick.

                                    NICK
                    You're kidding, right?

                                      MONROE
                    Not if you want to stay alive.

      Nick sighs, rubs some wolfsbane on himself.  Nick heads for
      the bridge.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    What are you doin'?

                                    NICK
                    You said he was over the bridge.

                                      MONROE
                    Why don't you just call him and tell
                    him you're comin'?  This way.

83EXT. STREAM/FOREST - NIGHT83

      Monroe heads down the embankment.  Moonlight reflects off
      the water, eerie bridge in the b.g. Trees overhang the banks. 
      Nick follows and they wade across a small stream.                                                                                      48.

                                    NICK
                          (whispers)
                    Isn't this what the bridge is for?

      They climb up the embankment on the other side.  Monroe stops
      suddenly, seeing the POSTMAN'S COTTAGE a hundred yards away;
      Monroe holds out his hand to signal Nick: stop.

                                      MONROE
                    That's his place.

      Monroe SUDDENLY MORPHS into a Blutbad.  Startling Nick.  Is
      he going to attack?  Nick instinctively reaches for his gun.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                          (still in Blutbad
                            form)
                    Relax.

      With a great EFFORT Monroe forces himself back into human
      form.  Breathing hard:

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    Let's go.

      They continue through the woods, getting closer to the house. 
      Monroe SUDDENLY MORPHS AGAIN.  Stops.  His breathing even*
      quicker now.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.

      Morphs back.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    He's in there, I know he's in there.

                                    NICK
                    Do I need something like, silver
                    bullets?

                                      MONROE
                    What are you, an idiot?

      They take a few more steps, Monroe morphs again.  Releasing
      a low GUTTURAL GROWL from his throat.

                                    NICK
                    What's happening?

                                      MONROE
                          (back to human, really
                            agitated)
                    This is as far as I can... I can't
                    guarantee what'll happen if I go any
                    closer.  It's too dangerous, I don't
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      49.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    know if I'll be on his side, your
                    side, I might even go after the girl.

      Monroe retreats to the stream.  Nick hurries to catch up.

                                    NICK
                    I'm supposed to do this by myself?

                                      MONROE
                      I wouldn't if I were you.  Keep this.

      Monroe stuffs the baggie of wolfsbane into Nick's hands.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    There's nothing more I can do.

      Monroe lopes off down the embankment and across the stream. 
      Nick turns back and looks at the cottage.  Then down at the
      baggie of wolfsbane in his hand.

84INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT84

      CLOSE ON blood-stained BOOTS.  Postman tries to clean off
      the dried blood with peroxide and cotton balls.  He rubs and
      rubs and rubs, but when he pulls the cotton away, the stain
      is still there.  Just like in Macbeth.

85INT. HANK'S APT. BEDROOM - NIGHT85

      Hank is asleep.  His cell phone rings.  He fumbles for it.

                                    HANK
                    What?

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:

      NICK -- hunched down in the woods, watching the house,
      whispering.

                                    NICK
                    It's me.  I found her.  I know she's
                    still alive.

                                    HANK
                    Nick?

                                    NICK
                    I need back up.  Now.

                                    HANK
                          (throws back the covers)
                    Where are you?                                                                                      50.

86INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT86

      The Postman, now wearing house slippers, a bright yellow
      cardigan and a bow tie, whistles "Once Upon a Time in Your
      Wildest Dreams" as he carries the boots to a fire place.

      He opens the glass doors and places the boots in the roaring
      fire.  Shuts the glass doors.  Stares at the fire, satisfied.

      He HEARS something in the distance from outside.  Pauses. 
      Sniffs the air.  Moves to the PICTURE WINDOW.  Looks out
      into the dark night.

      Then he HEARS a TAPPING from inside.  Robin's knocking on*
      the trap door from below.  Postman turns away from the window
      JUST AS -- we see --

      NICK - eighty yards in the distance, dashing back towards
      the stream.

      THE POSTMAN - bends over the trap door.  Hearing:

                                      ROBIN'S VOICE*
                    I want to go home...

      He flings open the trap door, revealing the scared little
      girl.  Staring up at him.

                                      POSTMAN
                    I told you.  You ARE home.

87EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT87

      Nick waits anxiously, watching as Hank's car drives up. 
      Hank gets out, Nick runs up.

                                    HANK
                    Where is he?

                                    NICK
                          (rapid fire)
                    In a house on the other side of the
                    bridge but we can't take the bridge
                    so we have to go cross the stream
                    but you're gonna have to put some of
                    this on first --

      Nick rubs wolfsbane on Hank who slaps his hand away.

                                    HANK
                    What the hell are you --

                                    NICK
                    So he won't smell us.

      Hank just stares at him.                                                                                      51.*

                                      HANK*
                    We're not huntin' deer here -- *
                    where's back up?*

                                    NICK
                    You're the only one I called.

                                    HANK
                    WHAT?

                                    NICK
                    I already cried wolf once.  You think
                    anybody'd believe me?  Come on.

      Nick leads a reluctant Hank down the embankment.

                                      HANK*
                    How'd you find this place?*

                                      NICK*
                          (lying)*
                    Uh... the boots.  I couldn't sleep,*
                    I started looking at addresses and
                    this is one of 'em. 

      Nick wades across the stream, Hank following.*

                                    HANK
                          (whispers)
                    You do know there's a bridge, right?

      And up the other side.  COTTAGE visible a hundred yards away.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    You better be right this time, buddy. *
                    You saw boot prints, right.*

                                      NICK*
                    Yeah. Over there by the house.*

                                      HANK*
                    Exact match?*

                                      NICK*
                    From what I could tell. *

                                      HANK*
                    You run his plates?*

                                      NICK*
                    I'm still waiting.  What's the matter,*
                    you don't trust me?*

      Hank sizes up his partner for a moment, then:*

                                    HANK
                    Okay.  Let's do this.                                                                                      52.

88INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT88

      The Postman straightens the rug over the trap door and puts
      the table with the flower vase back on it, rearranging the*
      flowers to his liking.*

      He stiffens, sensing something.  Postman turns slowly.  Looks*
      at the door.  Expression darkening as his eyes narrow and*
      his nostrils flare. *

      The doorbell RINGS.*

      Postman takes a deep breath, calming and controlling himself. *
      Putting on a smile.  A subtle transformation from evil to*
      benign.*

89EXT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT89

      Nick and Hank wait.  Hank grabs a rag off the porch railing 
      and is drying off his shoes when he realizes Nick has his
      hand on his gun.

                                    HANK
                    Nick, enough.  Get your badge out,
                    calm the hell down.  What's his name?

                                    NICK
                    Who?

                                    HANK
                    The guy we're here for!

                                    NICK
                    Oh.  Um... I forget.

      Hank shoots him a look as Postman opens the door with a
      pleasant smile on his face.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Good evening.  Can I help you?

      Nick and Hank both glance down at the Postman's feet.  He's
      wearing his house slippers.

                                    HANK
                    Sorry to disturb you, sir, I'm
                    Detective Green, this is Detective
                      Burckhardt.  You have a few minutes?

      Nick stares hard at the Postman, expecting him to MORPH at
      any second.  Postman senses something about Nick.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Of course.  Would you like to come
                    in?                                                                                      53.

                                    HANK
                    That'd be great.

      They enter.

90INT. HIDDEN CELLAR - NIGHT90

      Robin, bound and gagged on the bed, hears FOOTSTEPS and*
      MUFFLED voices above.  She looks up, terrified.

91INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT91

      The quaint and charming cottage.  They glance at the Hummel
      figurines, the fire crackling in the fire place.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Would you like some coffee or hot
                      chocolate?  It's all fair trade.

                                    HANK
                    No thanks.

                                      POSTMAN
                    We can sit in the living room...

      Postman motions to a love seat with elaborately crocheted
      pillows.  Woodsy scenes, happy German children, etc.

                                    HANK
                    Nice pillows.

                                      POSTMAN
                      I crocheted them myself.
                          (leans in)
                    Not that I tell everyone.

      We HEAR a DING from the kitchen.

                                      POSTMAN (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, pot pie's done.  Just give me
                    a second.

      The Postman heads for the kitchen.  Hank shoots Nick a look,
      then moves to study the incredible wall of Hummel figurines. 
      Nick moves up.  Hank looks over.

                                    HANK
                          (quietly)
                    Are you kidding me?

                                    NICK
                    Hank, I really believe this is the
                    right guy...
                          (off Hank' look)
                    I think.  This time.                                                                                      54.

      Nick looks around a little desperately.  Sees a secretary
      desk.  He quickly pulls down the top, revealing a pile of
      papers and mail.  Nick shuffles through the papers.

      Hank glances toward the kitchen door.

                                    HANK
                          (quietly)
                    What are you -- we don't have a
                    warrant.

                                    NICK
                    Got it!
                          (closes secretary
                            desk)
                    His name is Ditmarsch.  Errol
                      Ditmarsch.

                                    HANK
                    Great.  Case solved.

      Hank shoots Nick a look and then heads for the kitchen,
      walking right ACROSS THE THROW RUG, PAST THE TABLE WITH THE
      VASE FULL OF FLOWERS.

92INT. CELLAR - NIGHT92

      Robin watches the ceiling, following the SOUND of the*
      FOOTSTEPS with her eyes.

93INT. THE POSTMAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT93

      The Postman who is now wearing a plaid apron and oven mitts,
      is bending over the oven, pulling out a perfectly browned
      chicken pot pie. *

                                    HANK
                    Mr. Ditmarsch.

      Caught off guard, the Postman's face darkens briefly as Hank*
      and Nick enter the kitchen.  Postman quickly controls his*
      emotions.*

                                      POSTMAN
                    Sorry this is taking so long, but
                    you know how delicate crusts are.

      Nick looks around at the Old World kitchen.  Bronze pots
      hang from the rafters, German sausages dangle from wooden
      pegs.  Large sharp knives on display next to a meat grinder,
      and a sausage stuffer.

      Postman puts pot pie on butcher block to cool, pulling off
      oven mitts and apron.  Turns and studies Nick for a moment. 
      Something about Nick disturbs him.  But he can't let on.                                                                                      55.

                                    HANK
                    What kind of work do you do?

                                      POSTMAN
                    I work for the government, like you.
                          (then)
                    I'm a Postman.  Not the most glamorous
                    job but I like it.  Keeps me outdoors,
                    I love nature.

                                    NICK
                    Where were you today between two and
                    four o'clock?

                                      POSTMAN
                    On my route.  All day.  I know Postmen
                    get blamed for a lot of things, but
                    we're not all bad.  I'd love to be
                    helpful, but I'd like to know what
                    this is about.

      Nick shows him a PHOTO of Robin Howell.*

                                    NICK
                    This little girl went missing earlier
                    today.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Oh my god, that's awful... you don't
                    think I had anything to do with this,
                    do you?

                                    HANK
                    We just have to run down every
                      possibility.

                                      POSTMAN
                    What possibility could have led you
                    to me?

                                    NICK
                    We're looking for some boots.

      The Postman just looks at Nick, smiles, and:

                                      POSTMAN
                    Feel free to look anywhere you want.

                                    HANK
                    I don't think that's necessary, we've
                    wasted enough of your time.

                                    NICK
                    No, no, I want to check the bedroom.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Be my guest.                                                                                      56.

94INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT94

      Nick flings open the closet, revealing a neat row of shoes,
      no boots.  Nick, frustrated, opens a chest at the foot of
      the bed, filled with blankets.

      Hank leans against the doorway, watching as Nick goes down
      on the floor and looks under the bed.

                                    HANK
                    Nick.  If this guy had something to
                    hide, he would have thrown us out of
                    here.  I'm leaving.  I want to keep
                    my job.

      Hank heads out, Nick looks around the room one more time,
      then dejectedly follows.

95INT. HIDDEN CELLAR - NIGHT95

      Robin's eyes continue to follow the sounds of more footsteps,*
      crossing the floor above her.  Tears in her eyes.

96INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT96

      Nick and Hank move to the front door.  They HEAR whistling
      just before the Postman appears from the kitchen.  He stops
      whistling when he sees them.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Anything else?

                                    HANK
                    No.  Thanks for your time.

      Hank opens the door, exits.  Nick glances back at the Postman,
      then follows Hank out.  The door shuts.  The Postman moves
      to the window, watching them walk away.

97EXT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT97

      Nick, dejected, and Hank walk away from the cottage.  Smoke
      rising from the chimney.

                                    NICK
                    Sorry, Hank, I really thought --

                                    HANK
                          (stops)
                    Wait, wait.  The song --

                                    NICK
                    What song?

                                    HANK
                    He was whistling the song.  The one
                    on the dead girl's iPod.                                                                                      57.

      Hank and Nick swing around.

      POSTMAN - can be seen in the window, watching them from forty
      feet away.  Suddenly the Postman moves from the window.  A
      moment later all the lights in the house go out.

      Hank and Nick break into a run, racing back to the house.

98INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT98

      Dark except for the flickering fireplace.

      Hank and Nick kick open the door and enter.  Guns drawn.  No
      Postman in sight.  Hank reaches for the wall switch, flicks
      it, but no light.  Hank silently signals Nick to search one
      part of the house while he searches another.

99INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT99

      Nick enters the dark kitchen.  Tries the light.  No luck. 
      Looks around at all the knives glistening in the moonlight. 
      The largest one missing.

      Meanwhile Hank moves past the Hummel collection which looks
      oddly menacing in the dancing firelight.

                                    NICK
                    Hank!  He's got a knife!

      As Hank turns, the Postman leaps from the shadows.  Before
      he can fire, Hank is knocked to the floor.

      Hank moves his head just in time to avoid the blade which is
      coming down at him.

      The blade slams into the floor with such force that it is
      buried up to the hilt.

      Hank struggles for his feet, is picked off the ground and
      hurled into the Hummel collection which crashes to the floor --

100INT. HIDDEN CELLAR - NIGHT100

      Robin stares up at the ceiling HEARING the horrendous fight*
      above.  She closes her eyes, scared to death.

101INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT101

      NICK - runs in, trying to get a shot off as the Postman lunges
      at him.  From Nick's POV THE POSTMAN IS IN FULL BLUTBAD FACE.

      Nick's gun fires, hitting the Postman but not slowing him
      down.  Nick is knocked off his feet into the table, knocking
      it over as he crashes to the floor, flower vase shattering.

      THE POSTMAN - tears out the door.                                                                                      58.

      HANK - is on his knees, gun in hand.

      The POSTMAN - running FAST.  Inhumanly fast.  Hank empties
      his gun.

      THE POSTMAN - crumples as the bullets tear into him.

102EXT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT102

      Nick and Hank run out, guns ready, Hank reloading.

      They move up cautiously on the Postman who's dying.

                                    NICK
                    Where is she?  WHERE IS SHE?!

      The Postman looks up at Nick.  Trying to speak.  Nick leans
      in close as the Postman whispers:

                                      POSTMAN
                    Grimm...

      The Postman dies, his dead eyes glaring up at Nick.

                                    HANK
                    She's gotta be in the house.

      They race back to the house.

103INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT103

      CLOSE ON BREAKER BOX - Nick's hand flicks on the master
      switch.

      The LIGHTS come on in the house.

      Hank and Nick search the house, opening closets, hope chests,
      calling the girl's name -- "Robin!  Robin!"*

104INT. HIDDEN CELLAR - NIGHT104

      Robin hears her name being called.  She struggles to get*
      loose from the brightly colored ropes that bind her hands
      and feet.

105INT. POSTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT105

      They move back into the living room.  Frustrated.

                                    HANK
                    Damn it, she's not here.
                          (pulls his cell phone)
                    We have to call it in.

      Nick stops, sees the WATER FROM THE BROKEN VASE puddled on
      the floor.  Draining slowing into a crack in the floor.                                                                                      59.

      Nick flings aside the rug, revealing the trap door.

                                    NICK
                    Hank!

      Nick rips open the trap door.

106INT. HIDDEN CELLAR - NIGHT106

      Robin sees the trap door open, and Nick scramble down, not*
      sure what to expect.

      Nick sees her.

                                    NICK
                    Hank!  She's here!

      He moves to the bed.  Starts untying her, reassures her as
      Hank comes clattering down the stairs:

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    It's okay, honey.  We're police.

      Hank sees her, relieved, moving to help.

                                    HANK
                    I don't how you did it, but you did
                    it.

107EXT. ROBIN HOWELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT107*

      MUSIC MONTAGE: Police cars parked in front.  Police, Mother,
      Grandfather and Captain Ericson wait as Hank's car pulls up.

      They descend on the car as Nick gets out with Robin who runs*
      to her mother's tearful embrace.

      Nick and Hank watch the reunion as Capt. Ericson moves up,
      shakes their hands, clearly a job well done.

108EXT. NICK'S VICTORIAN HOUSE - NIGHT108

      Juliette opens the front door as Nick walks up the front
      steps.  She hugs him tight.

                                      JULIETTE
                    You saved her.

      Nick's arms go around her.  Hold on them.

109INT. EDDY MONROE'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING109

      CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER - "Little Girl Found - Kidnapper Killed
      by Police".  File PHOTOS of Hank and Nick.

      Monroe is having his morning coffee, looking at the paper. 
      His house is now cleaned up.  KNOCK at the door.                                                                                      60.

      He gets up, opens the front door, revealing Nick.

                                      MONROE
                    Didn't expect to see you again - at
                    least not in one piece.

                                    NICK
                    I just wanted to say thanks.

                                      MONROE
                    He knew I helped you, didn't he.

                                    NICK
                    I don't know.

                                      MONROE
                    At least he's dead.  Otherwise he'd
                    be looking for me.  He was my cousin. 
                    Father's side.  We never got along
                          (stares at Nick, hard)
                    He had a lot of family... who loved
                    him.  Too bad you got your picture
                    in the paper.  Gonna make it easier
                    to find you.

      Beat.

                                    NICK
                    My aunt told me my parents were
                    murdered.

                                      MONROE
                    What's that got to do with me.

                                    NICK
                    I might need your help again sometime.

                                      MONROE
                    ...we'll see.

      He shuts the door on Nick who stares at the closed door then
      walks away.

110INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - NIGHT110*

      Nick sits holding Marie's hand.  She is still unconscious.*

      He touches a jagged scar on the back of her hand.  Her hand*
      moves, taking him by surprise.  He looks up, her eyes are*
      open, staring at him.*

                                      NICK*
                    Marie...*

      She manages a smile.*                                                                                      61.*

                                      MARIE*
                    Nicky... you've seen a lot, I can*
                    tell.

                                      NICK*
                    ...I lost what you gave me.*

                                      MARIE*
                    It isn't lost, you just have to stop*
                    looking for it... so it can find*
                    you.

      Her smile fades.*

                                      NICK*
                    Marie...*

      But the light has gone out of her eyes and the medical alarms*
      go off as she flatlines.  Nick stands up suddenly, staggers,*
      as some powerful surge knocks him to his knees.  He falls to*
      the floor as orderlies and nurses run in.*

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK:*
