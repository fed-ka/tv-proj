Millar/Gough Ink

Mandy Films12.16.10      In a homage to the original series and to add a dynamic story-
      telling element to the show, we utilize a cutting-edge, split-
                    screen technique we call  MULTISCREEN .  

        This device will allow us to follow continuous action from 
        multiple points of view.  Unlike traditional split screens, 
           multiscreens  can be different shapes and sizes and will 
                                    never be static.                                               ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      OVER PITCH BLACK, a MAN S VOICE that s as smooth and 
      comforting as a glass of 50-year-old Highland Malt...

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Once upon a time, there were three 
                    little girls who got into very big 
                    trouble.  The first was a Park 
                    Avenue princess turned thief...  

      ABBY SAMPSON drops THROUGH THE FRAME.  She s 26, Caucasian, 
      and her flawless body is squeezed into a black Lycra catsuit.  
      Her blonde hair is tucked under a knit cap.  She s hanging 
      from a harness, in the middle of a jewelry heist.   

      DIVIDE INTO MULTISCREEN:  

      Manhattan glitters like a dream.  A hand twists the dial of a 
      safe.  Diamonds cascade into a gloved hand.  An alarm is 
      triggered.  Flashlight beams land on Abby, who puts up her 
      hands, caught in the act.   

      Abby s mug shot.  Right side.  Left side.  Front view.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    The second was a Miami street racer 
                    turned gang member.    

      END MULTISCREEN.

      GLORIA MORALES is behind the wheel of a tricked-out Corvette.  
      A trio of police cruisers in hot pursuit.  She s 28, 
      Hispanic, in a wife-beater and blue Parkway Gangsta bandana, 
      grinning in adrenaline-fueled ecstasy.  

      DIVIDE INTO MULTISCREEN:  

      The spinning rims of the crimson Corvette.  A rose tattoo 
      stretching up her arm.  A speedometer brushing 140.  Gloria 
      peels around a corner and straight into a police roadblock.  
      She is thrown against a chain-link fence and cuffed.      

      Gloria s mug shot.  Right side.  Left side.  Front view.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    And the third was a decorated 
                    police detective turned dirty cop.  

      END MULTISCREEN.                                                                                2.


      KATE PRINCE strides through the doors of a beach-front Miami 
      dive.  She s 28, a regal African American.  A SWEATY-FACED 
      MAN in a booth nods her over.  He reeks of gangster.  

      DIVIDE INTO MULTISCREEN:  

      A Miami PD badge sparkles with pride.  A razor cuts a line of 
      coke.  The Gangster passes Kate a fat envelope.  She heads 
      for the door when THREE PATRONS leap up with badges and guns.  
      She is thrown to the floor, caught in a sting.  

      Kate s mug shot.  Right side.  Left side.  Front view.  

      GO TO TRISCREEN.  The mug shots slot INTO VIEW.  The lowest 
      moments of their lives captured in washed-out digital color.   

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    They each made mistakes, but I gave 
                    them a second chance and now they 
                    work for me.  

      The mug shots FLIP and we get our first FULL-SCREEN GLIMPSE 
      of our Angels.  Beautiful.  Confident.  Glamorous.  Dressed 
      in white.  Walking side by side, LAUGHING, in sun-kissed 
      light.  A crime-fighting trifecta of feminine cool.   

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    My name is Charlie.

      As those iconic words are uttered... 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      AN AERIAL SHOT FLYING FAST AND LOW OVER Ocean Drive, Miami's 
      Art Deco, neon-drenched hub of cool, which ZEROES IN ON...

      EXT. ROOFTOP CLUB - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      MODEL-HOT GUESTS throng the poolside tables and cabanas.  
      CAMERA TRACKS an exquisite female form in a day-glo bikini 
      swimming under the water.  She breaks the surface and we see 

      IT S ABBY.

      She scans the crowd, clocks a slick 40-something in a linen 
      suit.  This is JAMES MACKAL.  He crosses to the bar.  Abby 
      slides on a kimono silk robe and grabs an oversized Diane Von 
      Furstenberg beach tote.  As she weaves her way to...

      EXT. BAR - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      Mackal lifts a pomegranate martini to his lips -- WHAM! 
      Abby s tote  accidentally  knocks him as she passes.  His 
      drink sloshes onto his linen suit.  She is mortified.                                                                                  3.


                                  ABBY
                    I m so sorry.  
                          (re: red stain)
                    I managed to kill your martini and 
                    mortally wound your jacket. 

                                  MACKAL
                    I don t think it s fatal.   

      Abby takes a glass of soda water, dips some napkins and 
      starts to dab the stain.  Mackal enjoys the attention. 

                                  MACKAL
                    I m impressed with your skills. 

                                  ABBY
                    Clothes and cocktails are my 
                      specialty.

      He s too busy flirting to notice Abby expertly pickpocket his 
      cell phone.  

      GO TIGHT:  She presses a wafer-thin, penny-sized bug onto the 
      back of the device. 

                                  ABBY
                    You re good to go. 

      She dumps the napkins onto the illuminated counter and 
      discreetly slips the cell phone back into Mackal s pocket.  

                                  MACKAL
                    Can I buy you a drink? 

                                  ABBY
                    I m such a klutz, I d probably 
                    spill it.  One fashion emergency is 
                    enough for tonight. 

      She turns away.  Her girly smile evaporates and is replaced 
      with steel-edged determination.  She pulls an earwig from her 
      robe and slots it into place.  

                                  ABBY
                          (into earwig)
                    Okay, Angels, time to fly.

      INT. LOBBY - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      It s a statement in minimalist cool.  

      KATE                                                                                 4.


      strides across the white marble in an awesome silver coat and 
      envy-inducing Jimmy Choos.   

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    You bug Mackal s phone?

                                  ABBY
                    With one hand behind my back.  You 
                    in position?

      Kate arrives at the elevators.  She looks around, then stabs 
      the button of the service elevator.   

                                  KATE
                    Almost. 

      The doors open, she steps in and hits  B .  When the doors 
      close, she pulls off the coat, revealing a maid s uniform 
      underneath.  A pair of sensible sneakers hang from the belt.  
      As she quickly changes shoes...

                                  KATE
                    Gloria, has the buyer s rep touched 
                    down?

      EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

      GLORIA.

      She s wearing a tailored three-piece pinstripe suit with an 
      adorable matching cap and is hands down the sexiest chauffeur 
      you ve ever seen.  A stretch limo gleams behind her.  

                                  GLORIA
                    Walking off his G6 as we speak. 

      She steps forward to greet ROGER FISK as he descends the 
      steps of a Gulfstream.  He s 45, an unremarkable accountant 
      type.  She flashes a million-dollar smile.

                                  GLORIA
                    Welcome to Miami, Mr. Fisk.

      TRISCREEN ENDS as she escorts him to the limo... 

      INT. SERVICE HALL - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      Kate steps out of the elevator.  She selects a service cart 
      from a row lined up against the wall and nods to a YOUNG MAID 
      who is clocking out.  CAMERA FOLLOWS the Young Maid as she 
      steps to the elevator.  The doors open, revealing                                                                                 5.


      THE JIMMY CHOOS.

      They re sitting in the middle of the floor.  Curious, the 
      Young Maid plucks the note scrolled in the left shoe.  

      TIGHT ON NOTE:  The paper is embossed with a pair of gold 
      angel wings.  The words  Handle With Love  are handwritten.  

      OFF the Maid s SCREAM of delight...

      EXT. ROOFTOP - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      Abby weaves through the crowd.  

                                  ABBY
                          (into earwig)
                    Bosley. 

      A jowly MIDDLE-AGED MAN in an ascot and blazer turns.  She 
      smiles politely, moves past but stops when she sees the real 
      deal sitting in a hot tub with TWO NORWEGIAN SUPERMODELS.

      JOHN BOSLEY 

      is 30, a perfect specimen of 21st-Century American manhood -- 
      a chiseled, whip-smart, tech-savvy, preppy charmer.  

                                  ABBY (V.O.)
                          (over earwig, annoyed)
                    Bosley, adult swim is over. 

      He looks over and catches Abby s disapproving glare.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Sorry, ladies, duty calls.  
                          (Norwegian with subtitles)
                    Text me.

      Bosley climbs out, sees Abby head through a door marked 
       EMPLOYEES ONLY, SERVICE ROOF ACCESS , and crosses to...

      INT. CABANA - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      He closes the flap, yanks an iPad from a Jack Spade gym bag.   

      EXT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

      Neon reflections ricochet off the hood.      

      INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

      Fisk is on a cell phone.  The thick privacy barrier is up.  
      Unknown to him, Gloria is eavesdropping via an earwig.                                                                                  6.


                                  FISK
                          (into phone)
                    I m meeting Pajaro s broker in 20 
                    minutes to pick up the package.  

      When she hears the name Pajaro, Gloria s face hardens and she 
      white-knuckles the wheel.

                                  FISK
                          (into phone)
                    I ll email you a picture now.  
                          (dirty smirk)
                    I think you ll approve.  

      TIGHT ON CELL PHONE:  He pulls up an image of a fresh-faced 
      girl in a T-shirt and jean shorts.  Her name is SARAH DANIELS 
      and she just turned 16.  As Fisk hits  Send ...

      INT. CABANA - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      Bosley finger-slides a window open on his iPad.  It s a high-
      tech GPS phone-tracking program.  

                                  BOSLEY
                          (into earwig)
                    Okay, Gloria, I m wired in.  Turn 
                    on the spin cycle. 

      INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

      Gloria grins, hits a button, locking all the doors, then 
      wildly turns the wheel.  

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      The limo SCREAM-PEELS across two lanes of traffic, sending 
      cars SKIDDING, and CAREENS into a deserted, multilevel 
      parking structure. 

      INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

      Fisk is violently slammed around the back.   

                                  FISK
                    ARE YOU INSANE!  STOP!  

      Gloria goes even faster.  Prada boot to the pedal.  

      INT. UPPER LEVEL - PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

      The limo catches air as it ROARS INTO VIEW.  It kicks up a 
      cloud of sparks as it CRASHES down and begins slaloming 
      around a line of concrete support columns.                                                                                  7.


      INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

      Battered and terrified, Fisk is seriously losing it.  

                                  FISK
                    I DON T WANT TO DIE!  PLEASE!

      Gloria sweeps out of a turn and powers straight for the 
      safety barrier that encircles the edge of the structure.    

      INT. UPPER LEVEL - PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

      It s a suicide run until Gloria BRAKE-SLIDES the limo to a 
      dead stop an inch from the barrier.  Before the smoke has 
      cleared, she climbs out, clicks open the passenger door.   

      FISK

      is on the floor, a confused mess.  Gloria drags him out.  He 
      is hysterical with fear.  

                                  FISK
                    Take whatever you want!  

                                  GLORIA
                    I want a room number!  Where s 
                    Pajaro s broker keeping the girl?  

                                  FISK
                    I... I don t know.  I swear.  

      Enraged, she gut-punches him.  He buckles, winded.  

                                  FISK
                    I m meeting him at the bar.  Guy 
                    named Mackal.  Once he s confirmed 
                    my boss s wire transfer, he ll give 
                    me instructions how to get the 
                    package out of the hotel.  

                                  GLORIA
                    She s not a package!  Her name is 
                    Sarah.  She s 16 years old.    
                          (leaning in)
                    You know what they do to guys in 
                    prison that traffic underage girls?

                                  FISK
                    Please!  I ll do anything.  I m 
                    just the middleman.

      Gloria plucks his phone from the back seat.  Holds it up.                                                                                8.


                                  GLORIA
                    You re going to make a phone call 
                    and you better be Oscar worthy. 

      He nods and with a shaky finger inputs a number.

      MULTISCREEN WHEN NECESSARY:

      INT. HALL - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      Kate pushes her cart into an elevator, on alert. 

      EXT. SERVICE ROOF - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      Abby zips up a black bodysuit, tightens the straps of a 
      climbing harness, then grabs a sleek crossbow and a coil of 
      cable from her tote.  

      EXT. BAR - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      Mackal waits at the bar.  Checks his watch, impatient, until 
      his cell phone CHIMES.  As he slides it to his ear, he 
      doesn t notice the bug attached to the back of the handset.

                                  FISK (V.O.)
                          (over phone)
                    It s Fisk.  The limo never showed.  
                    I m jumping in a cab.   

                                  MACKAL
                          (into phone)
                    I ll be here.  

      Mackal CLICKS off and speed-dials a number.

                                  MACKAL
                    Sit tight.  Buyer s rep is running 
                    late.    

      INT. CABANA - NIGHT

      Bosley watches the iPad program track the call. 

      TIGHT ON iPAD: It flashes with an address. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    He called room 2342.  

      Kate hits  23  on the elevator panel. 

                                  KATE
                    Get visual confirmation Sarah s in 
                    the room.                                                                                 9.


      Bosley opens another program.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    I m on it. 

      It looks like a game console.  He hits the  POWER UP  button.  

      EXT. SERVICE ROOF - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

        A REMOTE-CONTROLLED TOY HELICOPTER lifts off from between the 
      hotel s air conditioning units.  CAMERA FOLLOWS as it banks 
      down the side of the building.  

      INT. CABANA - NIGHT

      TIGHT ON iPAD:  The screen features a real-time helicopter 
      COCKPIT VIEW and a schematic of the hotel.  

      EXT. FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      The chopper zeroes in on room 2342.  It hovers 10 feet from 
      the window.  The curtains are drawn.    

      INT. CABANA - NIGHT

      Bosley hits a button and the cockpit view goes THERMAL.  The 
      glowing red outlines of FIVE FIGURES BECOME VISIBLE.  The 
      smallest lies on the bed, gagged and bound -- THIS IS SARAH.

                                  BOSLEY
                    Okay.  I ve got five heat 
                      signatures.  Sarah s on the bed.   

      INT. HALL - 23RD FLOOR - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      The elevator doors split and Kate emerges with her cart.  
       2342  is at the end. 

                                  KATE
                    Abby, you ready to do some 
                      housekeeping? 

      EXT. SERVICE ROOF - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

                                  ABBY
                    Dropping in now. 

      Abby turns, raises her crossbow.  Fires straight at the LENS.  
      PHHHHHT!  A bolt with a cable attached embeds in the fire 
      escape door.  She clamps the cable to her harness, sprints 
      forward and basejumps off the building.  

      MULTISCREEN ENDS.                                                                               10.


      INT. HOTEL ROOM - FALCON HOTEL - NIGHT

      Sarah s on the bed, numb with fear.  The four GUARDS are 
      built like linebackers.  Two watch a Dolphins game on the 
        wall-mounted flat-screen while the others sit at a table, 
      eating room-service pizza.  

      DING DONG!

      One of the Dolphins fans, Guard #1, steps to the door.   

                                  GUARD #1
                    Who is it?

      DING DONG!  Annoyed, he yanks a heavy-duty Glock .45 from his 
      waistband and leans into the peephole.  

      WHAT HE SEES:  A fish-eye view of Kate!  She is in midair 
      with her leg outstretched -- WHAAAM!  She HAMMER-KICKS the 
      door right off its hinges!  

      The door SLAMS on top of the Guard.  He tumbles back and is 
      knocked out when his head hits the floor.  Kate charges over 
      the fallen door and into the room.  Taken by surprise,  

      THE OTHER GUARDS 

      pull their weapons.  As they face her, the window behind them 
      SHATTERS and Abby swings into the room in a shower of glass.  
      She lands with cat-like ease and instantly goes on the 
      attack.  She spin-kicks Guard #2, sending him face first into 
      the TV -- CRAAACK!  Then clotheslines #3.  

      GUARD #4

      is the last man standing.  Working in perfect synch, Kate and 
      Abby take him out with a combo of kicks and body blows.  The 
      women step to the bed and gently untie Sarah.  

                                  KATE
                    It s okay, Sarah.  You re safe now.

      She regards them, confused and grateful.

                                  SARAH
                    Who are you?  You don t look like 
                    cops.

                                  ABBY
                    We re Angels. 

      OFF her smile, the SCREEN DIVIDES INTO THREE and our title:

                                     CHARLIE S ANGELS                                                                                11.


      slides INTO VIEW.  The SCREEN DISSECTS again, revealing...  

      AN ART DECO SPEAKERPHONE BOX.

      It s sitting on the coffee table in...

      INT. DEN - TOWNSEND AGENCY - NIGHT

      The open-plan space is on the second floor with views over 
      Ocean Drive.  It s vibrantly furnished and with a swoon-
      worthy mix of vintage and modern pieces.  Bosley and the 
      Angels are huddled around the speakerphone. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                          (on the Box)
                    I spoke to Sarah s parents.  They 
                    were relieved to have their 
                    daughter back safe and sound.  She 
                    won t be running away again soon. 

                                  KATE
                    Now that Mackal s hiding behind an 
                    army of lawyers, what are the 
                    chances he ll flip on his boss 
                    Pajaro?  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    It s doubtful he s even met him. 

                                  ABBY
                    You realize the irony of that 
                    coming from you, Charlie. 

                                  KATE
                    Miami PD s been trying to nail 
                    Pajaro for years.  He doesn t leave 
                    any footprints, electronic or 
                      otherwise.  He s a ghost.   

                                  GLORIA
                    Ghosts aren t real -- this guy is 
                    and I want him to bleed.

      The vehemence of her statement takes them by surprise. 

                                  KATE
                    Easy, girl.

                    Sorry, creeps like that just piss 
                    me off.                                                                                 12.


                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Don t lose sight of what you 
                      accomplished tonight.  Sarah s safe  
                    because of you three. 

      Bosley CLEARS his throat, feeling left out. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    And of course you, Bosley. 

      He shrugs modestly. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I m proud of all of you.  

                                  ABBY
                    Hold onto that feeling, Charlie, 
                    when you start hearing the 
                      unexpected charges we racked up 
                    tonight.   

      Bosley shakes his head and mouths the word  No .

                                  ABBY
                      Especially the bar tab for Bosley s 
                    hot-tub buddies.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    Astrid and Inga were a completely 
                      legitimate undercover expense.   

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I look forward to the debrief --
                    tomorrow.  Good night, Angels. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      MULTISCREEN MUSIC MONTAGE:

      AERIAL SHOT of a candy-apple red Porsche speeding across the 
      Causeway.  The BUZZING lights of South Beach.  The Porsche 
      glides up to the valet of a club, Ripcord.  Abby, Kate and 
      Gloria step out, styled and ready to party.  Abby winks to 
      the BOUNCER guarding the rope and the trio strides into... 

      INT. RIPCORD - NIGHT

      A Technicolor fantasy.  YOUNG BODIES sway.  The Angels CLINK 
      cocktail glasses.  On the dance floor the girls let loose.  
      Free spirits.  Gloria steps to the booth and texts somebody.  

      MULTISCREEN ENDS. 

      Gloria puts away her phone as Abby slides in next to her.                                                                               13.


                                  ABBY
                    I m enforcing a strict no-texting-
                      while-clubbing rule.  

      Kate joins them. 

                                  KATE
                    I need backup out there.

      Abby playfully takes Gloria s hand. 

                                  ABBY
                    Come on, potential ex-boyfriends 
                    await.     

                                  GLORIA
                    Mind if we bail early?

      They look at her, surprised. 

                                  ABBY
                    I m sorry, who are you and what 
                    have you done with our best friend?  

      Kate studies Gloria, concerned. 

                                  KATE
                    Usually I m the one who cuts out 
                    before midnight.  You okay?   

                                  GLORIA
                    Just not in the mood to party 
                    tonight.  

      Abby wags her finger. 

                                  ABBY
                    I m chalking your sacrilege up to a 
                    lack of sleep.   

      INT. PORSCHE - MOVING - NIGHT

      Wind-down MUSIC PURRS.  Abby drives.  Gloria is in the back 
      while Kate, in the front, raids the glove box.  

                                  ABBY
                    Snoop much?

                                  KATE
                    On a gum hunt.  Have to pass the 
                    human Breathalyzer when I get home.                                                                                14.


                                  ABBY
                    It s sweet your mom waits up for 
                    you.  

                                  KATE
                    It s weird and overbearing.  I m 28 
                    and pay the mortgage.  But if I 
                    come through that door past 
                    midnight, it s like a perp walk.

                                  ABBY
                          (teasing)
                    You should have told me you have 
                    curfew.  

      Abby checks the rear view and sees Gloria, staring out the 
      window, lost in thought.  Kate pulls out a stack of letters.  
      She notes the return address,  CLEARVIEW STATE PENITENTIARY .  

                                  KATE
                    When you said your dad was reaching 
                    out -- you didn t say it was a full-

                    hitting my spam file and began a 
                      snail-mail assault.  The Wolf of 
                    Wall Street can be relentless when 
                    he s focused.  

                                  KATE
                    You haven t opened any. 
                          (off Abby s silence)
                    Aren t you even a little curious 
                    what he has to say?

                                  ABBY
                    I used to steal Warhols to get that 
                    man s attention, now I couldn t 
                    care less.  

      EXT. STREET - LITTLE HAVANA - NIGHT

      The sleepy storefronts are shuttered.  The Porsche sweeps 
      around the corner.  Its headlights momentarily illuminate 

      A HISPANIC WOMAN

      sitting in a sage Jeep parked in the shadows.  She s 28, with 
      intense eyes and the taut body of a Marine.  She ducks as the 
      Porsche pulls up in front of the florist,  SENOR FLOWER .                                                                               15.


      INT. PORSCHE - NIGHT

      Unaware they are being watched, Abby swivels to Gloria. 

                                  ABBY
                    Your stop, Miss Morales.  

      Kate studies Gloria s preoccupied face. 

                                  KATE
                    You re way too quiet back there.  
                    You sure everything s okay?

      Gloria s about to say something but changes her mind. 

                                  GLORIA
                    Just beat.  Catch you ladies

                                  ABBY
                    It is tomorrow. 

      They LAUGH.      

      EXT. SENOR FLOWER - NIGHT

      Kate stands by the Porsche, watching Gloria head up the 
      stairs to the apartment above the store.  She sees Gloria s 
      purse on the back seat.  She grabs it, crosses to the stairs 
      just as Gloria steps inside.

                                  KATE
                    Hey, G, you forgot your--

          KAAAAABOOOOOOOOOOOM!  A DEAFENING EXPLOSION rips through the 
      apartment.  A torrent of fire, glass and splintered wood 
      rains.  The concussive force of the blast launches Kate off 
      her feet.  Abby leaps out, frantic.

                                  ABBY
                    GLORIA!  GLORIA! 

      She races to help Kate, who is dazed but alive.  The women 
      stare at the apartment, angry flames lick the darkness.  No 
      way Gloria could have made it.  OFF their utter despair...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. MIAMI GENERAL - TO ESTABLISH - DAY

      A Banyan tree stands guard in front of this Deco monolith.  

      INT. MIAMI GENERAL - ER - DAY

      Numb with grief, Kate perches on the edge of the bed.  Her 
      face is cut and bruised.  Abby appears at the door, drained.  

                                  ABBY
                    Doctor said you got the all clear. 

      Kate nods.  Abby sits next to her, emotionally spent.  

                                  KATE
                    How are you holding up? 

                                  ABBY
                    I m not.  I keep calling her cell.  
                    When I hear her voicemail message, 
                    I totally lose it.  You seem to be 
                    keeping it together.

                                  KATE
                          (smiles sadly)
                    Had a lot of practice.  After my 
                    dad passed, my mom fell apart.  I 
                    had to step up and stay strong for 
                    my brothers. 

                                  ABBY
                    You don t have to stay strong for 
                    me.

      She wraps her in a hug.  Kate s Kevlar facade crumbles.    

                                  KATE
                    We re going to find out who did 
                    this. 

                                  ABBY
                    If it s the last thing we do.

      OFF their emotional pact... 

      INT. HALL - MIAMI GENERAL - DAY

      The Angels have almost reached the elevators when DETECTIVE 
      RAY GOODSON steps out of one.  He s 30 with handsome features 
      and a driven face.  Kate reacts in surprise.                                                                               17.


                                  KATE
                    Ray? 

                                  RAY
                    Glad to see you re okay. 

      He lifts his jacket, a detective s shield glints on his belt.

                                  KATE
                    We already gave our statements to 
                    the lead detective.

                                  RAY
                    Paperwork shuffle.  The case landed 
                    on my desk.   

      Kate reads between the lines and puts her grief aside. 

                                  KATE
                    You pulled rank because I was 
                    involved.  Didn t you?

                                  RAY
                    Don t make this personal.  

                                  KATE
                    Our best friend was just murdered 
                    and now my ex-fiance is running the 
                      investigation -- how is it not 
                    personal?   

      They lock eyes.  Neither blinks.  Abby breaks the stalemate. 

                                  ABBY
                    I don t think the cop staring power 
                    works on other cops. 

      Kate relents. 

                                  KATE
                    Where are you on leads? 

                                  RAY
                    We think Gloria s murder is gang 
                    related. 

                                  ABBY
                    No way.  Gloria hadn t been part of 
                    that world for years.  

                                  KATE
                    Cops like low-hanging fruit.  It s 
                    an obvious angle.                                                                                18.


                                  RAY
                    Ignore the obvious at your peril.  
                    Isn t that what you used to tell 
                    me?  The one time I did, it cost me 
                    my fianc e and the fast track.

                                  KATE
                    I thought we weren t making this 
                    personal. 

      He looks at her, concerned.

                                  RAY
                    Kate, please don t run around 
                    playing detective on this one.

                                  KATE
                    I don t play at anything. 

                                  RAY
                    I m trying to protect you.  A lot 
                    of your ex-colleagues are looking 
                    for any reason to lock you up.  

      She shakes her head, disappointed.  

                                  KATE
                      Appreciate the concern, Detective, 
                    but we re never letting this go.   

      Abby follows as she steps into an elevator.  OFF Ray, 
      watching the doors close...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. TOWNSEND AGENCY - TO ESTABLISH - DAY

      A hip breakfast CROWD packs the  Il Cielo  restaurant, which 
      occupies the Art Deco gem s ground floor.  Abby and Kate 
      enter the Tiffany blue door on the side.   The Townsend 
      Agency  is engraved on a polished brass plaque on the front. 

      INT. DEN - TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

      CAMERA TRACKS Abby and Kate as they step in and stop in their 
      tracks when they see 

      AN ARMY OF PEOPLE 

      diligently checking the interior with a variety of gear, 
      everything from metal detectors to sniffer dogs.  Bosley 
      waves the Angels over, leans into the Box.                                                                               19.


                                  BOSLEY
                    Charlie, they re here. 
                          (to crew)
                    Can we have the room?

      The sweeper unit files out as the girls cross to the Box.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                          (over the Box)
                    Bosley updated me from the 
                    hospital.  Thank God you re okay.  

                                  KATE
                    We re fine.  Who are all these 
                    people?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Just a precaution.  They re 
                    sweeping the Agency.  I sent teams 
                    to your homes as well.  

                                  KATE
                    You think we re being targeted?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I can t confirm that you re not.  
                          (beat)
                    Angels, tell me the truth.  Gloria 
                    was family.  Her murder is our most 
                    personal case.  I need to know 
                    you re up for the fight.

                                  ABBY
                    Bring it on.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Good to hear.  I ll back you all 
                    the way, pull any string, call in 
                    any favor -- just remember you re 
                    angels of justice, not angels of 
                      vengeance. 

      INT. PLAYROOM - TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

      This is Bosley s parlor of high-tech cool.  Soho House-chic,  
      it s a grown boy s wonderland of monitors, hard drives and 
      arcade games.  Abby and Kate huddle around his workstation.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    I pulled this off a cigar store 
                    security camera across the street 
                    from Gloria s apartment.                                                                               20.


      The girls study a monitor featuring grainy time-coded 
        surveillance footage.    

                                  KATE
                    Does Miami PD have this?

                                  BOSLEY
                    Owner doesn't trust cops.

                                  ABBY
                    But he found the charm of the Bos 
                      irresistible?

                                  BOSLEY
                    I have an honest face and I bought 
                    50 boxes of hand-rolled 
                      Presidentes.  

      He nods to the stack of cigar boxes on the pool table. 

                                  BOSLEY
                          (re: monitor)
                    This is half an hour before you 
                    guys pulled up.  Check out the 
                    woman knocking on Gloria s door. 

        MULTISCREEN:  On the monitor, the Hispanic Woman who was 
      parked in the Jeep heads down the stairs of Gloria s 
      apartment.  The Angels study the footage.  Bosley s fingers 
      toggle the image forward.  The Angels react as the explosion 
      replays and the Jeep speeds away. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    She waits in her car and splits 
                    right after the explosion. 

                                  KATE
                    Got a clean shot of her face?

      Bosley rewinds,  boxes  the Woman s face and it pixelates 
      INTO FOCUS.  Kate s eyes narrow as she notices something.

                                  KATE
                    Enhance the shadow on her left 
                    shoulder. 

      Bosley highlights the area and expertly adjusts the contrast.  
      A familiar rose tattoo sharpens INTO VIEW. 

                                  ABBY
                    Parkway Gangsta ink just like 
                    Gloria s.  Hate to think your ex 
                    picked up the right scent after 
                    all.                                                                                 21.


      Something still doesn t sit right with Kate.   

                                  KATE

                                  KATE
                    That s my birthday. 

      Bosley s fingers fly.  There s a friendly BEEP and the 
      database s welcome page opens.  Kate masks her surprise.  

                                  ABBY
                    Do I need to fill this awkward 
                    silence by stating the obvious?  

                                  KATE
                    Please don t. 

      Bosley pastes an image of the woman s face and initiates a 
      search.  A result PINGS.  Fingerprints.  Mug shots.

      He opens a search engine window.  Types in her name.  A list 
      of results pops up.  He hits one.  A formal military photo of

                                  ABBY
                          (charging forward)
                    Come on, let s teach this chick the 
                    meaning of shock and awe. 

                                  KATE
                    Whoa, tiger, slow down.  There s a 
                    reason they don t let cops 
                      investigate a partner s death.

                                  ABBY
                    Before you play amateur shrink, you 
                    should know I ve dueled with the 
                    best Park Avenue has to offer.                                                                                23.


                                  KATE
                    You re too emotionally involved and 
                    so am I.  We play this one by the 
                    book because I don t plan on losing 
                    another friend.

      Abby nods.  Slip 876 is coming up.  It s a boxy houseboat in 
      need of some TLC.  They cautiously approach.  

                                  KATE
                    Take the front, I ll take the back. 

                                  ABBY
                    It s called the bow and stern. 

                                  KATE
                    Glad all those summers in the 
                    Hamptons finally paid off. 

      They share a smile, pull guns and stalk up the gangplank.  
      Once onboard, they split in different directions.   

      INT. MAIN CABIN - HOUSEBOAT - DAY

      Abby brushes open the door with her gun and heads into the 
      interior, which is decorated in bright Caribbean hues.  Kate 
      steps in from the other side.  They meet in the galley.   

      ON THE FRIDGE  

      Kate tugs a photo from under the wing of a magnetic flamingo.   
      It features TEENAGE MARISA AND GLORIA.  Arms around each 
      other s shoulders.  

                                  KATE
                    Check it out.  G and our suspect.  
                    They look like best friends. 

      A CREAK -- on instant alert, the Angels look up just as a 
      figure CRASHES through the skylight in a shower of glass.  

      IT S MARISA!

      She lands between them, hammer-punches the gun out of Abby s 
      hand and scissor-kicks Kate s.  Marisa snatches the weapons 
      out of the air and points them at their previous owners -- 
      just as the Angels pull backup weapons and swing them up, 
      creating a four-gun Mexican standoff.    

                                  MARISA
                    For detectives, your breaking-and-
                    entering skills suck.                                                                                24.


                                  KATE
                    Why did you kill Gloria?

                                  MARISA
                    I didn t.  

      A distant RUMBLE.  Marisa looks at the plates drying on the 
      counter and sees they re RATTLING.  The SOUND grows LOUDER.  
      PUSH IN as Marisa realizes what s about to happen...

                                  MARISA
                    Take cover! 

      She dive-tackles Abby and Kate to the floor a second before   

      MACHINE GUNFIRE

      rips through the wooden ceiling and churns the interior to 
      confetti!  Broken plates and glasses avalanche.  A bowl of 
      fruit is pulped.  Abby glances up and sees they re under 
      assault from A GUNMAN standing on the skid of

      A HELICOPTER.  

      Realizing it s a deathtrap, the women scramble for the stern.  
      The aerial assault doesn t let up!  BULLETS nip at their 
      heels, decimate a sofa bed, spewing feathers into the air.      

      EXT. DECK - HOUSEBOAT - DAY

      The trio charges out the door.  GUNFIRE SPLINTERS across the 
      deck.  Bullet casings PING!  Hanging baskets EXPLODE like 
      pinatas.  Desperate, the women dive off the stern.    

      EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

      LOOKING UP as Abby, Kate and Marisa plunge INTO VIEW.  
      BULLETS RAZOR the water, leaving twisting contrails.  The 
      chopper hovers overhead, backlit by the sun.  

      EXT. AERIAL VIEW - MIAMI MARINA - DAY

      The helicopter hangs 15 feet above the water.  The Gunman 
      doesn t let up until his UZI FINALLY RUNS DRY.  He nods to 
      the PILOT, who banks sharply and powers towards the horizon.  

      EXT. SLIPS - MIAMI MARINA - DAY

      The THROB of the chopper FADES.  Abby, Kate and Marisa break 
      the surface, gulping for air.  OFF their narrow escape...  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                              25.


                                          ACT THREE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. MIAMI MARINA - DAY

      Abby and Kate pull themselves onto the dock, shaken and 
      stirred from their near-death ordeal.  Abby reaches down, 
      helps Marisa out of the water, then swings her against a 
      mooring post and angrily gets in her face.

                                  ABBY
                    Who were those shooters?

                                  MARISA
                    How the hell should I know!? 

                                  KATE
                    Easy, Abbs, let s do this back at 
                    the Agency. 

                                  ABBY
                    No, GI Jane starts filling in the 
                    blanks right now!  Like why she was 
                    in stalker-mode outside Gloria s 
                    apartment last night.
                          (off Marisa s surprise)
                    You were caught on tape fleeing the 
                    scene. 

                                  MARISA
                    And that makes me guilty?  

                                  KATE
                    Given your military background, it 
                    makes you an obvious suspect.

      Marisa wrestles free of Abby, starts down the dock. 

                                  MARISA
                    Gloria was like a sister to me, I m 
                    not playing this game.

                                  KATE
                    Fine.  Take your chances with the 
                    Miami PD.  They get a look at the 
                    shoulder ink, connect you to Gloria 
                    and you ll be in a cell pleading 
                    your case to a public defender. 

      Marisa stops, turns to face them.                                                                              26.


                                  MARISA
                    I got a text from Gloria.  Said it 
                    was urgent.  Asked me to come over.
                          (off Abby s look)
                    Check her phone records if you 
                    don t believe me.  

                                  KATE
                    Did she say what she wanted? 

                                  MARISA
                    Personal case she was working on.  
                    Wanted to show me something.  

      Abby and Kate absorb that revelation.  The sound of 
      approaching SIRENS cuts the moment.  Kate looks at Marisa. 

                                  KATE
                    Deal with them or come with us -- 
                    it s your call.   

      Marisa makes a silent decision and follows as the Angels 
      hustle towards the parking lot.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DEN - TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

      CAMERA TRACKS Bosley down the stairs.  He s holding a file. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    You two decent? 

      He finds Abby and Kate showered and changed.

                                  BOSLEY
                    Charlie called.  Wanted an update. 

                                  ABBY
                    Tell him unless fly-bys are the new 
                    drive-bys -- this case isn t gang 
                    related. 

                                  KATE
                    Where are we with the police?

                                  BOSLEY
                    So far no eyewitnesses are 
                    reporting anyone fitting your 
                      descriptions leaving the marina. 
                          (holding up file)
                    I ve got Gloria s phone records. 
                    She texted Marisa at 12:35.                                                                               27.


                                  MARISA (O.S.)
                    Gloria told me you had mad hacking 
                    skills.   

      They turn as Marisa enters in fresh clothes.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    Okay, I m not a big fan of the  h  
                    word.  It s like telling Picasso 
                    he s good at throwing paint onto a 
                    canvas.  I m director of technical 
                      operations and--  

                                  ABBY
                          (interrupting, to Marisa)
                    Wait.  Gloria talked to you about 
                    us?

                                  MARISA
                    All the time.  Said you were the 
                    best crew she ever had.  

                                  ABBY
                    She never mentioned you once. 

      Marisa shrugs, sits. 

                                  MARISA
                    Not surprised.  After I enlisted, 
                    we kinda lost touch.  I wanted her 
                    to sign up too, but she wasn t into 
                    people ordering her around -- got 
                    enough of that at St. T s.  

                                  KATE
                    Is that a halfway house?

                                  MARISA
                    St. Theresa s Orphanage.  El 
                    Salvador.  We used to call it God s 
                    hellhole.  Boot camp was a cakewalk 
                    compared to that place.  
                          (to Abby)
                    Guess she didn t mention that 
                    either. 

      Kate takes the file from Bosley and paces as she scans it.

                                  KATE
                    You two have been talking a lot 
                    recently.                                                                               28.


                                  MARISA
                    When I got dropkicked by Uncle Sam, 
                    I landed pretty hard.  Gloria was 
                    helping me get back on my feet.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    I swept her hard drive.  If she was 
                    working a case on her down time, 
                    she left no trace.  

                                  KATE
                    Do you have any idea what she 
                    wanted to show you?

      Marisa shakes her head.  Kate nods to Abby who stands.  

                                  KATE
                    We need to check out the scene of 
                    the crime. 

                                  ABBY
                          (to Marisa)
                    Stay here with Bosley. 

      They grab their jackets.  Marisa rises, pissed. 

                                  MARISA
                    I look like I need a baby-sitter?  
                    Gloria called me because she 
                    thought I could help.  

                                  ABBY
                    What we re doing is a little less 
                    than legal -- we don t need any 
                    more wild cards.  Right, Kate?

      Kate assesses Marisa.

                                  KATE
                    I ve got a spare jacket upstairs.  
                    Bos, you mind showing her?  

      He gets the hint and exits with Marisa.  Abby waits until 
      they re out of earshot, then vents...

                                  ABBY
                    I m sorry -- when did we go from 
                    guns in our face to sharing 
                    clothes?                                                                               29.


                                  KATE
                    I ve interrogated hundreds of 
                    guilty people, it s always in their 
                    eyes and I don t see it in hers.  
                    Besides, Gloria trusted her.

                                  ABBY
                    We don t even know if that story 
                    checks out.  Why are you so willing 
                    to give her a free pass?

                                  KATE
                    You mad at Marisa or Gloria? 

      The question hits home.  

                                  ABBY
                    Okay, I ll admit it.  I hate that 
                    Gloria kept things from us.  I 
                    mean, I m the queen of trust 
                    issues, but when it comes to you 
                    guys, I m an open book.

      Kate looks at Abby, supportive. 

                                  KATE
                    I m not suggesting we give her a 
                    gun and a key to the front door, 
                    but if she can help us find 
                    Gloria s killer, then we need to 
                    keep her close. 

      OFF Abby s nod of acceptance...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      10,000 BEES. 

      They re HUMMING on a frame oozing with honeycomb.  A puff of 
      smoke calms the horde.  GO SUPER WIDE TO REVEAL a TALL 
      FIGURE, dressed head to toe in white beekeeper s garb.  

      THIS IS CHARLIE TOWNSEND. 

      The hive is one of a trio that sits in the rose garden of...

      EXT. TOWNSEND MANSION - DUSK

      The magnificent Spanish Revival estate features ornate 
        wrought-iron detailing and GURGLING fountains.  It s nestled 
      in an exotic oasis of green.  A BUTLER in a sharp Paul Smith 
      suit approaches.  He s 40 and keeps a safe distance.                                                                                30.


                                  BUTLER
                    Telephone call.  It s Mr. Bosley.  

      INT. LIBRARY - TOWNSEND MANSION - DUSK

      The decor is sumptuous.  Among the Warhols and Rothkos hangs 
        a pre-Raphaelite painting of a trio of angels.  Masked by a 
      blinding shaft of light, Charlie steps to the desk (note: we 
      do not see Charlie s face).

      EXT. BALCONY - TOWNSEND AGENCY - DUSK

      Bosley waits with a cell phone to his ear, staring out across 
      the glittering sea.  He s backlit by the dying sun. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Sorry to keep you waiting, John.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    No problem, Charlie.  Hope you 
                    didn t get stung.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Not once.  Bees are beautiful to 
                    behold, only aggressive when 
                    pushed.  
                          (beat)
                    I assume my INS contact was 
                    helpful?

                                  BOSLEY
                    It s amazing how the head of the 
                    Service can cut through the red 
                    tape.  
                          (beat)
                    Marisa s records are sketchy, but 
                    her story checks out.  She arrived 
                    here with Gloria on amnesty visas 
                    when they were eight.  They lived 
                    with Gloria s uncle until he died.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I never thought I d lose another 
                    angel. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Blame me.  I m your eyes and ears.  
                    I should have been on top of it.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    We did this dance once before... 
                    when Elizabeth was killed.  I 
                    wouldn t let you fall on your sword 
                    then either.                                                                                31.


      Bosley smiles sadly.

                                  BOSLEY
                    I ve been thinking about her a lot 
                    today.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    My daughter loved you very much.  
                    Never forget that.  But right now, 
                    I need you to stay focused.  We ve 
                    had two attacks in less than 24 
                    hours.  Violent.  Quick.  
                      Overwhelming.

                                  BOSLEY
                    Who do you think we re dealing 
                    with?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Someone with a secret who needs to 
                    protect it at all costs.  Trust me, 
                    John, they re going to regret the 
                    day they ever crossed my path. 
                          (beat)
                    Keep me posted.

      As Bosley hangs up, STAY WITH Charlie.  A mysterious figure, 
      sitting alone, waiting for day to slip into night. 

      EXT. SENOR FLOWER - NIGHT

      A Crown Vic with TWO UNIFORMS is parked in front.  The 
      storefront is boarded up and the second-floor windows are 
      blown out and blackened.  Kate s SUV stops across the street. 

      INT. KATE S SUV - NIGHT

      Kate, Abby and Marisa are masked in shadow. 

                                  ABBY
                    Since when does Miami PD have extra 
                    uniforms to baby-sit a crime scene?

                      statement.  

                                  MARISA
                    Who s Ray?

                                  ABBY
                    Let s file that under don t ask, 
                    don t tell.

                                  ABBY (CONT'D)
                          (re: building)
                    Ladies, I got this.  

      EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

      OVERHEAD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as Abby assesses the narrow side 
      passage between Gloria s apartment and the building next to 
      it.  She hands Kate her backpack.  

                                  ABBY
                    Hold the Prada. 

      She sprints forward and in an incredible Parkour move 
        springboards off the ground, bounce-kicks between the 
      opposing walls until she vaults through the second-floor 
      window and into Gloria s apartment.  It s over in three 
      effortless seconds.  Marisa is speechless.   

                                  KATE
                    Abby put the  cat  in cat burglar. 

      Kate pulls a cable ladder from the backpack.  As she throws 
      one end up to Abby...

      INT. GLORIA S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Even in the moonlight, the extent of the damage is 
        depressingly clear.  Marisa waits as Abby helps Kate climb 
      through the window.  The women survey the damage, numb.  

                                  KATE
                    Donut patrol probably loops around 
                    every 20 minutes.  Keep the voices 
                    and flashlight beams down.  

      They CLICK on flashlights and begin to explore.  Kate looks 
      back and sees Abby hasn t moved.

                                  KATE
                    Abbs? 

                                  ABBY
                    Gloria didn t deserve this. 

      Kate puts a hand of comfort on her shoulder.  Abby takes a 
      deep breath, more determined than ever.  Water SQUELCHES 
      underfoot as they step to Marisa who kneels by the shattered 
      door.  They watch as she runs her finger down the frame. 

                                  MARISA
                    Military grade C4.  Mercury

                                  MARISA (CONT'D)
                    The charges were positioned to kill 
                    and scorch the place.  This was a 
                      stone-cold pro job.  

                                  KATE
                    So whatever she wanted to show you 
                    is probably destroyed. 

                                  MARISA
                    Give my girl a little credit.  You 
                    grow up in an orphanage, you learn 
                    to hide things that are valuable.   

      They spread out.  The beam of Abby s flashlight glances 
      across a Charlie Brown DVD lying in the debris.  Abby scoops 
      it up.  Its case is partially melted.  

                                  ABBY
                    I gave this to Gloria last 
                      Christmas.  Office secret-Santa 
                    gift.  She always had a weird thing 
                    for the Peanuts gang.  

                                  MARISA
                    We learned English watching Charlie 
                    Brown cartoons.  I think my first 
                    words were  Good grief .

      They share sad smiles, signalling a thaw in their 
      relationship. 

                                  KATE
                    Over here. 

      Abby and Marisa join Kate.  Her flashlight is aimed at a 
      picture hanging on the wall.  It features a South American 
      folk art drawing of a peacock with its tail feathers fanned.

                                  KATE
                    What s wrong with this picture?

      Abby s eyes narrow as she realizes that the frame is  
      perfectly angled while every other one has been blown right 
      off the wall or is totally askew.    

                                  ABBY
                    Nothing.

      She steps forward, feels around the frame and  hinges  the 
      right side of the frame back, revealing a compact wall safe.

                                  ABBY

                    Biometric lock.  Good deterrent 
                    against a common thief -- lucky for 
                    you I m exceptional.  

      Abby flexes her fingers in anticipation. 

                                  KATE
                    How long will it take you?

                                  ABBY
                    Last time I cracked one of these, 
                    it was under two minutes.  But that 
                    was after two Cosmos and I was 
                    hanging upside down.  

      SAFE POV -- the door swings open, revealing Abby, Kate and 
      Marisa.  Abby s flashlight FLARES THE LENS as it washes 
      across the interior s only occupant.  

      A CHILD S JEWELRY BOX. 

      A delicate mosaic butterfly glitters on the lid. 

                                  MARISA
                    That was her mom s.  At St. T s she 
                    never let it go.  Even slept with 
                    the damn thing.  

      Kate places it onto a scorched tabletop.  Abby and Marisa 
      hold their flashlights steady as Kate removes  

      A BAGGIE WITH A SHOT GLASS. 

      A slip of paper is taped to its side.  Kate peels it free and 
      scans it.   

                                  KATE
                    It s a DNA analysis report, just 
                    came back yesterday.  Gloria had 
                    two samples tested.  A flake of 
                    blood from the box and saliva from 
                    this shot glass. 

      TIGHT ON THE BAGGIE:  Spangles of light bloom as Abby points 
      her flashlight through the plastic and reads the words etched 
      onto the shot glass.  

                                  ABBY
                    Club Cypher.  That s on 10th and 
                    Ocean.  Little Eurotrash for me.                                                                              35.


                                  KATE
                    Thanks for the review. 
                          (studying report)
                    The DNA samples match.  

                                  ABBY
                    I wonder who the big winner is?

      Kate sees a photo lying face down at the bottom of the box.  
      She lifts it and sneaks a peek. 

                                  KATE
                    Must be this guy. 

      She holds it up for Marisa to see.  It s a grainy 
        surveillance closeup of a handsome HISPANIC MAN in his 40s.

                                  KATE
                    Ring any bells?

      PUSH IN TO MARISA as she stares at the Man in stunned 
      disbelief.  It s like she s looking at a ghost.  

                                  MARISA
                    Can t believe she found the son of 
                    a bitch.

                                  KATE
                    Found who?

                                  MARISA
                    Pajaro. 

      Before Abby and Kate can react to that revelation, they hear 
      FOOTSTEPS and the CRACKLE OF A POLICE RADIO on the stairs.   

                                  KATE
                    We re out of here.

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Lightning flickers across the sky.  A storm is rolling in.  
      Abby, Kate and Marisa dart back to the SUV, still reeling 
      from their discovery.  Abby types a web address into her 
      iPhone while Kate turns to Marisa.

                                  KATE
                    How do you know about Pajaro?

                                  MARISA
                    Long story.  But I had no clue 
                    Gloria had tracked him down.                                                                                36.


                                  ABBY
                    Check this out.  It s a real-time 
                    feed from inside Club Cypher.  

      She holds up her phone.  It features random shots of the 
      interior of the club.    

                                  ABBY
                    There s Pajaro.  VIP table with a 
                      nuclear-hot blonde.

      Kate and Marisa study the image.  A STUNNING WOMAN in her 
      late 20s sits at PAJARO S side along with TWO BODYGUARDS.  
      For the record, her name is NADIA IVANOV. 

                                  KATE
                    I ll call Bos, we need to loop in 
                    Charlie.

      But as she pulls out her phone, Marisa reaches across and 
      yanks Kate s gun from its holster.  Abby turns in shock as 
      Marisa levels the weapon at them.  

                                  MARISA
                    Toss your gun in the storm drain.  
                          (off Abby s hesitation)
                    I know how to use this!  

      Abby reluctantly complies, looks at Kate.

                                  ABBY
                    Told you we shouldn t trust her. 

                                  KATE
                          (to Marisa)
                    This is insane.  Don t do this.

                                  MARISA
                    I m keeping a promise I made to 
                    Gloria a long time ago.  

      Marisa yanks the keys from Kate s hand.

                                  MARISA
                    She wanted me to kill Pajaro.  

      Marisa climbs into the SUV.  OFF Kate and Abby watching, 
      helpless, as she STARTS the ENGINE and ROARS into the night.   

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                              37.

      FADE IN:

      BEGIN MULTISCREEN: 

      EXT. MIAMI STREETS/INT. KATE S SUV - MOVING - NIGHT

      Abby and Kate sprint down the street.  THUNDER booms.  

      Marisa PEELS around a corner, forged with determination.  

      The Angels weave through the CROWD waiting to get into a 
      garish Cuban bar.  Abby  brushes  past A MAN in a purple suit 
      and jacks his valet ticket.  Kate pulls out her phone. 

      INT. PLAYROOM - TOWNSEND AGENCY - NIGHT

      Bosley s shirtless, hanging upside down in gravity boots, 
      doing crunches.  He takes Kate s call when his Bluetooth 
      earpiece flashes.  INTERCUT WITH:

                                  KATE
                          (into phone, urgent)
                    Bos, I need you to activate my 
                    LoJack. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Somebody stole your car?

                                  KATE
                    Yeah, Marisa.  Tell Charlie it 
                    looks like Pajaro is behind 
                    Gloria s murder. 

      Bosley drops to the floor and crosses to his workstation. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Pajaro?

                                  KATE
                    I don t have a lot of details.  
                    Just find my car.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    What are you doing for transpo?

                                  KATE
                    Abby s got it covered.  

      She turns as Abby pulls up in a seriously tricked-out Mazda 
      RX-7.  It s canary yellow and its sides are tattooed with 
      flaming red skulls.  Kate climbs in.                                                                               38.


                                  KATE
                    Real subtle. 

      They SCREAM off as one of Bosley s monitors flashes with a 
      LoJack map.  Marisa s location pulses.    

      INT. MAZDA RX-7 - MOVING - NIGHT

                                  ABBY
                    A hundred guilty faces and she s 
                    not one of them, huh?

                                  KATE
                    Please don t go there right now. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Marisa s heading down Ocean.  She 
                    just passed 7th.  

                                  ABBY
                    She s going to Club Cypher! 

      END MULTISCREEN.

      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

      The RX-7 skids to a stop behind Kate s SUV that is parked 
      next to a dumpster.  The Angels race out and are drenched in 
      seconds.  They find the SUV is empty.  Kate sees the ladder 
      of a fire escape has been pulled down.   

                                  KATE
                    She s on the roof!

      EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

      The neon sign tints the rain phosphorescent green.  Marisa 
      kneels, levels her gun at the entrance to the Club.

      MARISA S POV: A white Escalade stops curbside.  A CHAUFFEUR 
      steps out with a white umbrella and greets Pajaro and Nadia 
      as they exit with the Bodyguards.  

      Marisa s eyes narrow with military certainty.  She takes aim.  
      Rain PINGS off the barrel as her finger tenses on the 
      trigger.  But a millisecond before she fires,   

      A BOOT

      SLAM-KICKS the gun out of her hand.  BOOOM!  The deflected 
      bullet glances the neon marquee.  Marisa spins to find

      KATE AND ABBY.                                                                              39.


      She launches herself at the Angels.  Silhouetted against the 
      neon and the rain, the trio trades an awesome variety of 
      kicks and punches.  Finally spent, Marisa drops to her knees 
      and begins to cry.  Exhausted, Kate and Abby regard her, 
      unsure.  Then Kate steps forward and offers Marisa her hand.  

                                  KATE
                    Let s get out of the storm. 

      Marisa nods, grateful.  GO WIDE as Kate helps her up.  

      EXT. PATIO - IL CIELO - NIGHT

      After closing.  Abby, Kate and Marisa are wrapped up, basking 
      in the glow of a fire pit.  Bosley approaches.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    His name s Nicholas Rodrigo.  The 
                    prints on that shot glass are his.  
                    He s a multimillionaire developer 
                    and one of the biggest 
                      philanthropists in the city.  

      He SLAPS down  Miami Magazine .  Rodrigo s on the cover, 
      standing in front of a cool Palm Island mega-mansion.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    His foundation builds orphanages in 
                    Central America.

      Marisa stares at Rodrigo s face, haunted by memories.   

                                  MARISA
                    Whatever that SOB s name is, he s a 
                    mass murderer.  

                                  KATE
                    Okay, no more secrets.  It s time 
                    to come clean.  

      Marisa touches the gold cross that hangs around her neck. 

                                  MARISA
                    Before Rodrigo was on magazine 
                    covers, he was the leader of a 
                    death squad in El Salvador.  They 
                    always wore masks and only attacked 
                    at night.  The locals called him 
                    Pajaro because he was like a bird 
                    that could never be caught.

                                  ABBY
                    If Rodrigo wore a mask, how can you 
                    be sure he s Pajaro?                                                                              40.


                                  MARISA
                    I guess I have an angel to thank 
                    for that. 

      She nervously reaches for the cross again.  GO TIGHT as it is 
      clenched by a child s hand.  REVEAL we have TRANSITIONED TO: 

        A SUPERSATURATED FLASHBACK.  

      The same necklace is worn by YOUNG MARISA.  YOUNG GLORIA is 
      at her side, clutching her butterfly box.  They re 8, in 
        nightdresses and bare feet.  They creep up the aisle of...   

      INT. CHAPEL - ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

      Thousands of candles of every size and shape flicker.  

                                  MARISA (V.O.)
                    Gloria and I snuck into the chapel 
                    on a dare.  We were always doing 
                    stupid stuff like that.  We were 
                    going to carve our initials on the 
                    back of this wooden angel.

      Young Marisa climbs onto a chair, reaches for the wooden 
      angel on tiptoes.  It s an exquisitely carved folk art 
      design.  She climbs down clutching the winged prize.  

                                  MARISA (V.O.)
                    That s when the trucks came. 

      Headlights wash through the windows.  The girls steal a peek. 

      WHAT THEY SEE:  A SQUAD OF MEN with machine guns leap off the 
      trucks.  Their faces are masked with bandanas.  A NUN races 
      out and is mercilessly SHOT in cold blood.   

      EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

      The leader (Pajaro) watches as his men round up the ORPHANS.  
      The girls are loaded into the trucks while the BOYS and NUNS 
      are lined up.  Pajaro nods and his men level their machine 
      guns at the cowering line of boys and women.  As they FIRE...

      INT. CHAPEL - ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

      TIGHT ON Young Marisa and Young Gloria witnessing the 
      nightmarish execution with saucer-eyed disbelief. 

      INT. CHAPEL - ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

      Pajaro strides in.  There s no sign of the girls.  He pulls 
      down his bandana, leaving no doubt he s Rodrigo, crosses 
      himself, then ransacks the chapel s valuable altar pieces.                                                                                41.


      PAN TO REVEAL the girls cowering under the altar table.  
      Young Marisa clutches the wooden angel while Young Gloria 
      holds her jewelry box.  Hot tears streak their cheeks.   

      Rodrigo stuffs a chalice into his satchel, turns to go when 
      he hears the FAINTEST WHIMPER.  He swings back and in one 
      move sweeps the altar table over, revealing the girls. 

                                    RODRIGO
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                    You know what happens to strays?

      He smirks, reaches for his gun when Young Marisa whips the 
      wooden angel across Rodrigo s face, SHATTERING one wing. 

      TIGHT ON THE JEWELRY BOX as it is spritzed with blood. 

      Rodrigo staggers back, holding a cut.  Using the distraction, 
      Young Marisa and Young Gloria race out the side door.  

      EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

      Fingers of moonlight filter through the trees and illuminate 
      the girls as they run for their lives, never looking back.

      Young Marisa reaches for the cross that bounces against her 
      neck.  GO TIGHT as an adult hand grasps it.  REVEAL that the 
      FLASHBACK HAS ENDED and we have TRANSITIONED BACK TO:

      EXT. PATIO - IL CIELO - NIGHT

      Marisa touches the golden keepsake.  

                                  MARISA
                    Gloria and I made a pact that if we 
                    saw Pajaro again, we d kill him.     

                                  KATE
                    My guess is she texted you the 
                    other night because she finally had 
                    the proof to make good on that 
                    promise.

                                  ABBY
                    Hold on!  The Gloria I knew would 
                    never murder anyone. 

                                  MARISA
                    That s why she didn t tell you, she 
                    knew you wouldn t approve. 

                                  KATE
                    Damn right we don t approve.                                                                               42.


                                  MARISA
                    You don t know what this bastard 
                    did with the girls he took.   

                                  KATE
                    Actually, we ve got a pretty good 
                    idea because he s still doing it -- 
                    he was behind a case we just broke 
                    with a 16-year-old runaway.  

                                  MARISA
                    Explains how Gloria got on his 
                    trail.  

                                  KATE
                    Rodrigo must have figured out who 
                    she was, tracked her and discovered 
                    you were still in the picture too. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    The hunter becomes the hunted. 

      Marisa nods, wrestling with the grim truth. 

                                  MARISA
                    He takes us out and his secret s 
                    safe.   

                                  KATE
                    Listen, we re going to get justice 
                    for Gloria and nail this guy -- but 
                    that doesn t involve blowing him 
                    away on Ocean Drive.   

                                  MARISA
                    I saw his face and freaked, okay?  
                    Won t happen again. 

                                  ABBY
                    You re right.  It won t.  We ve 
                    been on the wrong end of your gun 
                    twice.  It s not happening a third 
                    time.  You re benched. 

                                  MARISA
                            (frustrated)
                    Rodrigo s been giving law 
                      enforcement the middle finger for 
                    years.  How you gonna bust him?

                                  KATE
                    We don t exactly play by the rules 
                    either.                                                                                43.


                                  ABBY
                    Yeah -- we re Angels, not saints. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DEN - TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

      Morning light bisects the space.  Abby and Kate are huddled 
      around the Box holding iPads.  Bosley hustles in, flustered. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Sorry I m late, Charlie.  Had to 
                    cab it back from North Beach. 

                                  ABBY
                    I thought you only dated girls who 
                    were geographically convenient.

                                  BOSLEY
                          (pointed)
                    I was returning a canary yellow RX-
                    7 to its irate owner. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Any problems? 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Nothing floor seats to the Heat

      He grabs his iPad and sits.  Charlie gets down to business.

                    I ran Nicholas Rodrigo past my 
                      intelligence sources.  

                                  KATE
                    Let me guess, he s squeaky clean. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Spotless.  Abby, did you speak to 
                    Sarah?

                                  ABBY
                    She said she was blindfolded and 
                    kept in some sort of cage.  When 
                    they shoved her in a van to take 
                    her to the hotel, she heard other 
                    girls crying out in Spanish.  

                                  KATE
                    Rodrigo must be using his 
                      Foundation to funnel girls into the 
                    country for trafficking.                                                                               44.


                                  BOSLEY
                      I squeegeed his Foundation s 
                    database.  Somehow he s kept all 
                    his illegal activity off the grid.  

                                  KATE
                    He runs a criminal enterprise in 
                    the 21st Century.  The information 
                    has to be somewhere.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Actually, it s in someone. 

      A photo of Rodrigo s female companion from Club Cypher 
      appears on their iPads.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Her name s Nadia Ivanov.  She has a 
                      photographic memory. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    One of my MIT buddies told me about 
                    this chick.  But I thought she was 
                    an urban legend.  They call her the 
                    human hard drive.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    She absconded with four million 
                    dollars from the Russian mob.  
                    Rodrigo s bodyguards aren t for his 
                      protection, they re for her.  They 
                    go with her everywhere except 
                    inside his Palm Island compound.

                    According to his Twitter feed, 
                    Rodrigo s hosting a charity fund- 
                    raiser at his mansion tomorrow 
                    night.  
                          (wry)
                    The theme is heaven and hell. 
                    Sounds like we ll blend right in.

                    Big party.  Lots of security 
                      distractions.  We go undercover and 
                    grab Ivanov. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Hate to buzz-kill the plan, but 
                    don t you think the police would 
                    consider that kidnapping?                                                                               45.


                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    The police need evidence, I only 
                    need certainty.  Ivanov is the best 
                    way to link Rodrigo to his crimes 
                    and take him down. 

                                  MARISA (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.

      All turn as Marisa steps in. 

                                  ABBY
                    Which part of  you re benched  
                    wasn t clear?

                    Actually, I invited Miss Valdez. 
                    Thought she could be useful.    

      Marisa reads Abby s irritation.

                                  MARISA
                    I know I ve given you no reason to 
                    trust me, but Gloria was the only 
                    family I had.  I want to help. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    It s fortunate for you that I 
                    believe in second chances.  
                    However, my largess is finite -- 
                    don t let me down again.  

                                  MARISA
                    I won t.   

      Charlie CLICKS off.  Marisa looks at the Angels.    

                                  MARISA
                    I hope you guys are cool with this?

                                  ABBY
                    Charlie calls the shots. 

                                  KATE
                    And we re willing to go on a little 
                    faith.  

      Marisa nods, grateful.  OFF their tentative alliance...

      EXT. RODRIGO S MANSION - PALM ISLAND - NIGHT

      A FIRE EATER in a white top hat and tails spits a fireball 
      right at the LENS.  CAMERA BURSTS through the sparks TO 
      REVEAL the fund-raiser in full swing.  The theme is 

      HEAVEN AND HELL.

      The GUESTS are dressed in white.  Dry ice wafts across the 
      grass like a cloud.  STILT WALKERS roam, throwing silver 
      confetti.  It s a glamorous exercise in excess.  

      ABBY, KATE AND MARISA

      emerge through a curtain of mist.  They re undercover as 
      servers and are carrying platters of hors d oeuvres.  Each is 
      dressed in the coolest, reddest, sexiest devil outfit.   

                                  KATE

                    Bos, are you set?

      In a white Tom Ford suit, Bosley stands by the bar.  

                                  BOSLEY
                          (into earwig)
                    Truck s in position in the back by 
                    the bathrooms.  Once the spray hits 
                    Ivanov s stomach, she ll start 
                    cramping in 30 seconds.    

                                  KATE
                    Marisa, tell us when you ve got a 
                    20 on Rodrigo. 

      Marisa spots Rodrigo schmoozing in a special VIP area.  

                                  MARISA
                          (into earwig)
                    He s trading high-fives with LeBron 
                    James.

                    Good.  Stay on him.  Let us know if 
                    he moves. 

      Kate spots Ivanov.  She s standing in the shadow of a giant 
      ice angel, sipping a flute of Veuve Clicquot.  

                                  KATE
                    Abbs, you want to take the first 
                    shot at Ivanov?  She s by the ice 
                      sculpture.                                                                               47.

                    Can hardly tell the two apart. 

      Abby surreptitiously pulls a pump dispenser and sprays her 
      platter of blinis and caviar.  She approaches Ivanov. 

                                  ABBY
                    Blini?  

      Ivanov doesn t even make eye contact, waves her off. 

                                  ABBY
                    Caviar s the real deal, flown in 
                    from the Caspian Sea this morning.

      Ivanov sniffs the black eggs on a blini, scoffs... 

                                  IVANOV
                    More like a fish farm outside of 
                    Moscow.  Shoo. 

      Her accent is muted.  Shot down, Abby turns away. 

                                  ABBY
                          (into earwig)
                    Wow... if she were any colder, I d 
                    get frost bite.  

                                  FEMALE (O.S.)
                    Abby Sampson?

      She is startled by BRIDGET and PRISCELLA WENTWORTH.  They re 
      her age and radiate Upper Eastside Bitch. 

                                    BRIDGET
                    Bridget and Priscella?  

                                  PRISCELLA
                    Dalton Prep?  

      Abby squirms, clearly rattled by this unforeseen reunion.  

                                  ABBY
                    The Wentworth twins.  Sure.  Hi.  
                    It s been forever. 

                                  PRISCELLA 
                    Cute outfit.  Are you one of the 
                    servers?   

                                  ABBY
                    Yeah, recession s a bitch. 

      Bridget s facade of friendliness drops.                                                                               48.


                                    BRIDGET
                      Considering what your father did, 
                    I d call it payback.  Do you know 
                    how much money he screwed our uncle 
                    out of?

                                  ABBY
                    No idea.  I haven t spoken to my 
                    dad in years.   

      Priscella snaps a cell phone photo of Abby. 

                                  PRISCELLA
                    For my Facebook page.  I m sure all 
                    your old Dalton friends would love 
                    to know how you re doing.  

      Abby hides her humiliation with a forced smile.   

                                  ABBY
                    It s been a blast catching up.  I 
                    need to get back to work. 
                          (offering tray)
                    Blini?

      Both take one and head away.  Abby s shoulders sag, she dumps 
      the rest of the tray in the trash.  Marisa steps over.   

                                  MARISA
                    Nice friends.  You okay?

                                  ABBY
                    I will be in about 30 seconds.  

      They watch as Bridget and Priscella wince, hold their 
      stomachs, obviously cramping, and hurry to the bathrooms.    

                                  ABBY
                    At least we know the gut juice

                                  MARISA
                    No wonder Gloria liked you.  She 
                    had a twisted sense of humor too.

      Abby offers Marisa a smile, takes one of the bite-sized 
      devil s food cakes from her tray and gobbles it in one.

      Kate is about to move in with her tray of empanadas when she 
      sees Ivanov spurn another SERVER.                                                                                49.

                                  BOSLEY
                    Starving grad student.  My buddy s 
                    one of the caterers.  I tagged 
                    along for the free food and to 
                    watch the rich and famous in their 
                    natural habitat. 

                                  IVANOV
                    What do you think of the wildlife 
                    so far?

                                  BOSLEY
                    It just got more interesting.  

                                  IVANOV
                          (seductive)
                    Let s take a walk. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. POOL HOUSE - RODRIGO S MANSION - NIGHT

      Bosley and Ivanov SLAM into the FRAME.  Making out hot and 
      very heavy.  Her hands are all over him.    

      EXT. RODRIGO S MANSION - PALM ISLAND - NIGHT

      Marisa sees Rodrigo head out of the VIP pen.  

                                  MARISA
                          (into earwig)
                    Rodrigo s on the move.  Could be 
                    looking for Ivanov. 

      Kate reacts to the news with renewed urgency. 

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    Bos, time to put your party on 
                    wheels.  Get her to the catering 
                    truck.  I ll meet you there. 

      EXT. POOL HOUSE - RODRIGO S MANSION - NIGHT

      Bosley breaks off.  Brushes his hand down Ivanov s cheek. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Why don t we find a place with a 
                    little more privacy?                                                                               51.


                                  IVANOV
                    The guesthouse is on the other side 
                    of the compound. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    My pal s catering truck is closer.  

                                  IVANOV
                    Down and dirty.  Is that your 
                    style?

                                  BOSLEY
                    Just a guy looking for a good time.

      Without warning, she suddenly grabs his crotch and squeezes 
      like a vice.  She leans in and viciously hisses...

                                  IVANOV
                    You ve got five seconds to tell me 
                    who you really are?

                                  BOSLEY
                          (groaning)
                    Look... um...

                                  IVANOV
                    Four.  Three.  Two. 

      WHHAAACK!  Ivanov releases her grip of Bosley s nuts and 
      sinks to the ground, unconscious, revealing Kate.  

                                  KATE
                    Nice job, Casanova. 

      Bosley winces, clearly in agony.  

                                  KATE
                    You can ice your jewels in the 
                    truck. 

      He helps her lift Ivanov.  They put her arms around their 
      shoulders, it looks like they re helping a drunk.  

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    Abby, Marisa -- we ve got Ivanov.  
                    Time to fly. 

      EXT. RODRIGO S MANSION - PALM ISLAND - NIGHT

      Still holding her tray of chocolate treats, Marisa turns to 
      exit but knocks straight into Rodrigo.  The mini-cakes 
      cascade down his spotless white suit.  The party stops and 
      all eyes turn.  Rodrigo looks at his ruined suit, grins.                                                                               52.


                                    RODRIGO
                    I knew the devil would get me 
                      eventually. 

      Everybody LAUGHS and gets back to it.  Marisa bows her head.    

                                    RODRIGO
                    It was my fault.  I ran into you.  

      She nods.  He lifts her chin with his finger.  

                                    RODRIGO
                    You okay?  I m not going to bite.

      She looks into his face, trying to contain her fury.  Without 
      a word, she finally heads away.  He watches her, his face 
      flickering with unease. 

      INT. CATERING TRUCK - NIGHT

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig, concerned)
                      Security s swarming.  Marisa, where 
                    are you?

      EXT. RODRIGO S MANSION - PALM ISLAND - NIGHT

      Marisa hustles around the side of the house.  But as she 
      passes the doors of Rodrigo s office, she sees something 
      hanging on the wall that stops her in her tracks.   

                                  MARISA
                          (into earwig)
                    Delayed.  Don t wait.  

      INT. OFFICE - RODRIGO S MANSION - PALM ISLAND - NIGHT

      The French door opens and Marisa steps inside.  She crosses 
      to the wall by the desk and stares up.  Only now do we REVEAL 
      the wooden angel -- the one that hung above the altar at the 
      orphange.  Marisa gently touches the broken wing.  

                                    RODRIGO (O.S.)
                    I kept that as a reminder of when I 
                    let two little girls get away. 

      Marisa spins and finds Rodrigo and a BODYGUARD. 

                                  MARISA
                    You killed my friend, you son of a 
                    bitch!                                                                              53.


                                    RODRIGO
                    I caught her checking me out in my 
                    club.  But when she didn t want to 
                    party, I got suspicious and tracked 
                    her down.  That s when I discovered 
                    the truth about both of you.

      Her grabs her chin, forces her to look him in the eye.

                                    RODRIGO
                    I guess fate gave me a second 
                    chance to correct my mistake.  

      The Bodyguard puts his finger to his earwig, listens.  Then  
      leans into Rodrigo. 

                                  BODYGUARD
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                    Ivanov s missing.  Her tracking 
                    chip s been jammed. 

      Rodrigo spins back to Marisa, who smirks triumphantly.

                                  MARISA
                    Pajaro is about to be unmasked.  

      Furious, he backhands her.  As she hits the floor, her earwig 
      is knocked free.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear. 

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                          (over earwig)
                    Marisa...

      INT. CATERING TRUCK - MOVING - NIGHT

      Bosley wears catering overalls and is driving while Kate and 
      Abby watch Ivanov, who is tied up in the back. 

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    ... are you out of there? 

      A PIERCING BLAST OF FEEDBACK greets her question.  All yank 
      their earwigs and look at each other.  OFF their realization 
      that something is very, very wrong...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT FOUR                                                                              54.


                                          ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:

      INT. GULFSTREAM JET - NIGHT

      Clouds slipstream past the windows.  Ivanov is slumped and 
      buckled in a chair, her wrist handcuffed to the armrest.  

                                  KATE
                    Time to bring the ice princess out 
                    of sleep mode.

      Abby SNAPS a vial of smelling salts under Ivanov s nose -- 
      waking her with a start.

                                  ABBY
                    Easy, the Captain hasn t turned off 
                    the fasten-seat-belt sign.  

                                  IVANOV
                    Who are you people?  Where are you 
                    taking me?   

                                  KATE
                    You re 25,000 feet over the 
                    Atlantic en route to St. 
                      Petersburg.   

      Ivanov s eyes narrow.

                                  KATE
                    Ripping off a Russian crime boss 
                    wasn t the smartest idea.

                                  IVANOV
                    Yabloko sent you?
                          (off Kate s nod)
                    I can get you three times what 
                    Yabloko s promised you.   

                                  KATE
                    We want information.  Rodrigo 
                    grabbed one of our team, where 
                    would he take her?  

                                  IVANOV
                    Turn the plane around.  I ll tell 
                    you when we re back in Miami. 

      Kate reads her body language like a seasoned interrogator.                                                                              55.


                                  KATE
                    You re lying.  She ll be dead by 
                    then.  
                          (to Abby)
                    Call Yabloko, tell him to have our 
                    money ready.  And he better not try 
                    and stiff us with counterfeit. 

      Ivanov reacts in surprise to the change of tack.

                                  IVANOV
                    What about your friend?

                                  KATE
                    She knew the risks. 

      Abby dials a satellite phone. 

                                  IVANOV
                    Wait.  Please... you don t know 
                    what he ll do to me! 

                                  KATE
                    Actually, he described it in pretty 
                    vivid detail.  You ready to talk?

      Ivanov nods her agreement.  Abby hangs up.  

                                  IVANOV
                    Rodrigo owns an abandoned wildlife 
                    park in the Everglades.  That s 
                    where he keeps the girls he 
                    traffics.  He would have taken your 
                    friend there. 

                                  KATE
                    We need an address. 

                                  IVANOV
                    13509 Turner River Highway.  
                    There s only one road in and the 
                    place is heavily guarded.  

      Abby crosses to the cockpit door and KNOCKS.

                                  ABBY
                    Bos, time to bail.  

      Suddenly, the ENGINES DIE.  Bosley exits the cockpit.  Ivanov 
      watches as Kate lifts the handle of the emergency exit. 

                                  IVANOV
                    ARE YOU INSANE!                                                                                 56.


      Kate shrugs and yanks the door open, REVEALING the plane is 
      actually stationary and sits in the middle of 

      A DARK HANGAR.  

      A Ritter fan and smoke machine work overtime.  Ivanov 
      realizes she s been conned and struggles with her cuff... 

                                  ABBY
                    Relax, at least you re not in 
                    coach.   

      Abby tosses her a bag of peanuts and exits with Kate and Bos.   

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE - GATORLAND - DAY

      A gator grins on the sign of this abandoned tourist 
      attraction.  A minivan ambles up.  The GATE GUARD steps over 
      and finds Bosley and Kate, dressed like Ohio tourists.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Hiya, we re a little lost.  

                                  GATE GUARD
                    This is private property.  Park s 
                    been closed for years.  

      Kate points to the sign, swats Bosley. 

                                  KATE
                    This is Gatorland!  We re looking 
                    for GatorWorld.  I told you it was 
                    a left off that highway.   

      As they talk, PAN DOWN TO REVEAL Abby clinging to the 
      undercarriage of the minivan.  She drops and rolls...

                                  BOSLEY
                    Don t start with me, Charlene. 

                                  KATE
                    Wasn t my idea to get up at the 
                      butt-crack of dawn and look at a 
                    bunch of stinking alligators. 

                                  GATE GUARD
                    Folks, you need to leave right now!

      Suddenly, he hears a WHISTLE.  He looks down and finds Abby 
      on the ground with a gun pointed straight at him.                                                                                57.


                                  ABBY
                    Actually, we re going to take a 
                    tour.  Piggly wiggles where I can 
                    see them. 

      INT. OLD ALLIGATOR SHED - GATORLAND - DAY

      Swampy shafts of light cut through the holes in the roof.  
      Marisa dangles by her wrists on a thick chain above the empty 
      circular pit.  She s sweat-drenched, in bad shape.  Rodrigo s 
      Bodyguard watches as his boss viciously backhands her.

                                    RODRIGO
                    Had enough?  

                                  MARISA
                    Just getting warmed up.

                                    RODRIGO
                          (losing patience)
                    Tell me who took Ivanov!  

      He snatches a Taser from the Bodyguard and brutally jams it 
      into Marisa s neck.  OFF her AGONIZED SCREAM...

      EXT. GATORLAND - DAY

      The collection of rusty corrugated metal buildings and sad 
      concrete enclosures sits waterside.  A couple of airboats are 
      moored at the end of a dilapidated jetty and the helicopter 
      that attacked Marisa s boat bakes in the sun near    

      AN OLD SCHOOL BUS.

      It s been painted puke-green, and the park s reptilian mascot 
      is painted on its sides.  CRANE DOWN TO Abby, Kate and Bosley 
      peeking out a window. 

      INT. BUS - DAY

      Abby spots TWO GUARDS patrolling in front of a barred cage 
      that once housed a family of Florida panthers.

                                  ABBY
                    Oh my God... look.

      Kate and Bosley follow her gaze and see 10 GIRLS penned in 
      the cage.  Most are Hispanic, and they re huddled together in 
      terror behind the bars.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    He s keeping them like animals.  

      Kate sees the Escalade parked in front of the alligator shed.                                                                              58.


                                  KATE
                    They must be holding Marisa in 
                    there -- we re going to need a 
                      distraction.  

      INT. OLD ALLIGATOR SHED - GATORLAND - DAY

      Marisa hangs limply.  Rodrigo realizes she s passed out.    

                                    RODRIGO
                          (to Bodyguard)
                    Ivanov isn t as strong as this one.  
                    She ll break.  It s time to slash 
                    and burn. 

      Suddenly, CEE LO S unmistakable anthem  FORGET YOU  BOOMS 
      from outside.  It GROWS LOUDER and is accompanied by the 
      sound of a ROARING engine.  

      EXT. WILD CAT CAGE - GATORLAND - DAY

      The two Guards watching the caged teens turn as 

      THE MINIVAN 

      careens INTO VIEW, its windows down and RADIO ON FULL BLAST.  
      The vehicle passes the helicopter and SMASHES full force into 
      a concrete picnic table.  Its wheels spin uselessly.   

                                    RODRIGO (V.O.)
                          (over radio, in Spanish)
                    What the hell s going on? 

                                  CAGE GUARD #2
                          (into radio, in Spanish)
                    Checking it out now. 

      The Cage Guards cautiously approach with Uzis ready.  They 
      find the Gate Guard slumped in the driver s seat.  His hands 
      are zip-cuffed to the wheel and the gas pedal is anchored to 
      the floor.  When they pull his head up, the word 

      BOOM!

      stares back from the tape that gags the Gate Guard s mouth.  
      As the Cage Guards look at each other in horror... 

      INT. BUS - DAY

      TIGHT ON Bosley s thumb as it presses a detonator trigger. 

      EXT. GATORLAND - DAY

      The helicopter 15 feet behind the minivan EXPLODES.                                                                              59.


                  KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! 

      The Cage Guards standing by the minivan are flyswatted 
      against the alligator shed, out for the count, as a fireball 
      and debris rocket sky-high.   

      BEGIN CLIMACTIC MULTISCREEN:

      INT./EXT. WILD CAT CAGE/BUS/OLD ALLIGATOR SHED - DAY

      Abby and Kate swing down from the tin roof of the wild cat 
      enclosure.  The grateful teens look on as Abby expertly 
      begins picking the cage s lock.    

      Bosley REVS the bus to life and ROARS forward. 

      Rodrigo freaks out, spins to his Bodyguard.

                                    RODRIGO
                          (re: Marisa, in Spanish)
                    Kill her! 

      He races out the door, brandishing an Uzi.  The Bodyguard 
      raises his Glock to kill Marisa when she jerks up her legs 
      and wraps his neck in a sleeper hold.  As they struggle...  

      Bosley pulls up to the wild cat cages and concertinas open 
      the door.  Kate hustles the liberated teens into the bus 
      while Abby takes off for the alligator shed.  

      Rodrigo races past the burning carcass of the helicopter 
      headed for his Escalade, but stops when he sees one of the 
      chopper s rotors embedded in the front of the vehicle.  

      Marisa vices the Bodyguard s neck but he breaks away and 
      swings up his gun.  Abby appears behind him, kicks the weapon 
      free, plucks it out of the air, then pistol whips him.  As he 
      drops, Marisa smiles with relief.  Abby shrugs, modestly. 

                                  ABBY 
                    Little trick I learned from a 
                    friend. 

      She helps Marisa down.

      Rodrigo races back, sees the last of the teens climbing into 
      the bus.  Furious, he OPENS FIRE!

      Kate, Bosley and the teens hit the deck as the bus is riddled 
      with DEAFENING lines of BULLETS.  When the onslaught finally 
      ends, Kate sees Rodrigo climb into a fan boat.  He takes off 
      just as Abby and Marisa head out of the alligator shed.                                                                               60.


                                  KATE
                    Bos, stay with the girls.  Call Ray 
                    at Miami PD.    

      She charges off to join Abby and Marisa.

      END MULTISCREEN.  

      EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY

      EPIC HELICOPTER SHOT FINDS Abby, Kate and Marisa on an 
      airboat powering down a sun-burnished waterway, wind whipping 
      their hair.  The boat shoots around a bend. 

      RODRIGO S BOAT

      is up ahead.  Abby GUNS the ENGINE while Kate takes aim.    

      EXT. RODRIGO S AIRBOAT - MOVING - DAY

      THWAACK!  A bullet hits the giant fan, causing it to SPUTTER, 
      smoke and stop.  Rodrigo sees the women speeding towards him.  
      He pulls a semiautomatic, OPENS FIRE as they approach.  With 
      fearless disregard for her life, 

      MARISA

      leaps across the water, roll-dives onto Rodrigo s deck and 
      kicks the weapon out of his hand.  She follows through with a 
      stinging right hook and sweeps up her gun as he reels back.  
      He dabs the blood that trickles from his cut lip, smirks.  

                                    RODRIGO
                    Go on.  Pull the trigger.  Get your 
                    revenge.  

      Abby and Kate jump onboard.  Marisa s finger tenses on the 
      trigger.  She s torn with emotion.  The Angels plead...

                                  KATE
                    I know you and Gloria made a pact.  
                    But this isn t the way to honor her 
                    memory.  

                                  ABBY
                    Don t give this bastard the easy 
                    way out.

      Tears sting Marisa s eyes.  It s the hardest choice she s 
      ever had to make.  She drills him with a look.  

                                  MARISA
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                    A bird in a cage dies slowly.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                              61.

                                  MARISA (CONT'D)
                          (in English)
                    That s what you deserve, Pajaro.

      With swift certainty, she pivot-kicks him in the head.  He 
      flies back into the fan s metal cage and is knocked out.  
      Abby and Kate step to Marisa and the three women embrace.  
      CRANE UP and UP until only blue sky FILLS THE FRAME...  

      PAN DOWN TO:

      EXT. HOUSEBOAT - MIAMI MARINA - DAY

      SUPER WIDE SHOT.  The sawtooth outline of downtown shimmers.  
      The vessel is a bullet-pocked ruin.  Marisa is sorting 
      through the debris when Bosley climbs aboard.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Charlie told me he called you.  I 
                    came by to see if you ve considered 
                    his offer?

                                  MARISA
                    Not sure why he d want me.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    He keeps his criteria close to the 
                    vest.  But it s usually a mix of 
                    skill sets, life experience, and 
                    the fact that your employment 
                    options are limited. 

                                  MARISA
                    Is that how he got you?

                                  BOSLEY
                    I was staring at a 20-year sentence 
                    for tax fraud.  
                          (off her surprise)
                    I planted a virus in the IRS 
                      mainframe, it skimmed a penny off 
                      everybody s tax return.  It was my 
                    own personal stimulus package. 

      Marisa smiles, amused. 

                                  MARISA
                    I m not that desperate, and working 
                    for a voice on a phone isn t my 
                    style.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    First rule of the Townsend Agency -- 
                    zero face time with the boss.                                                                               62.


                                  MARISA
                    I d settle for Skype.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Charlie s a very private person.  
                    But I promise he ll never order you 
                    to shoot a 14-year-old girl.

      The remark catches her off-guard. 

                                  MARISA
                    My military files are sealed. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    I ve got  mad hacking skills ,  
                    remember? 
                          (beat)
                    Court Martial Tribunal ruled that 
                    if you d fired when ordered, three 
                    soldiers in your squad would still 
                    be alive.  

      Marisa hesitates, bitter memories swirling.

                                  MARISA
                    I studied suicide bombers -- that 
                    girl didn t fit the profile.  With 
                    that one decision... my career was 
                    roadkill.     

                                  BOSLEY
                    Look at this as your second chance.  

      She s still skeptical. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    You know why Charlie calls the 
                    women who work for him Angels?
                          (off her shrug)
                    Because they show up when you least 
                    expect it but when you need them 
                    the most. 

      Bosley s cell phone suddenly RINGS.   

                                  BOSLEY
                          (re: cell)
                    It s Charlie.  Take my advice -- 
                    answer the call.

      He offers her the phone.  Marisa hesitates, then takes the 
      phone.  As she hits accept...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                              63.


      INT. DEN - TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

      Abby, Kate, Marisa and Bosley huddle around the Box.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Ivanov has agreed to turn state s 
                    evidence.  She s already given the 
                    FBI and INTERPOL a list of 
                    Rodrigo s clients past and present.  
                    They re making arrests as we speak.  

                                  KATE
                    What about the girls he trafficked?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I m working to ensure they all find 
                    safe homes and that the runaways 
                    are reunited with their families.  

                                  ABBY
                    Gloria can finally rest in peace.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I ve established a scholarship fund 
                    in her name to pay for their 
                    education -- every second chance 
                    deserves a helping hand.   

                                  MARISA
                    Somewhere out there she s smiling.   

                                  KATE
                    Those girls couldn t have picked a 
                    better patron. 

      They share a silent moment of remembrance.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    They have you three Angels to thank 
                    for their lives. 

                                  ABBY
                    Three?

      All turn to Marisa. 

                                  MARISA
                    Charlie gave me the heavy-duty 
                      recruitment speech.  I liked what I 
                    heard, but I told him no deal 
                    without your guys  blessing.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    You ve got my vote.                                                                              64.


                                  KATE
                    Mine too.   

      Abby considers Marisa, cracks a smile and extends her hand. 

                                  ABBY
                    Just remember we earn our wings 
                    together.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Welcome to the Angels, Marisa. 

                                  ABBY
                    This calls for a celebration and I
