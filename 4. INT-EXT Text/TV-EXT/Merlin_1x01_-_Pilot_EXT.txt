      Open on a figure, carrying a small backpack, clambering 
        enthusiastically up a steep hillside.  It s the last climb of 
      a long journey ...  

                                  GREAT DRAGON (V.O.)

                          (a deep and sonorous 
                            voice)
                    No young man, no matter how great, 

                    can know his destiny.  He cannot 
                    glimpse his part in the great story 
                    that is about to unfold... 

      We continue to follow the figure as he negotiates the final 
      rocks that will lead him to the summit, as yet his face is 
      still unseen ...  

                                  GREAT DRAGON (V.O.)

                    Like everyone, he must live and 
                    learn...  

      The figure nears the brow.  Ahead of him, slowly rising into 
      view we see soaring spires and turrets  ... 

                                  GREAT DRAGON (V.O.)
                    And so it will be for the young 
                    warlock arriving at the gates of 
                    Camelot.  A boy that will in time 
                    father a legend.  His name: Merlin.  

      As his name drifts away on the wind, we see his face.  He s 
      an instantly attractive, bright eyed young man with 
      unaffected good looks.  We take in his wonder and share his 

      P.O.V as he sets his eyes for the first time on the vast city 
      of Camelot ...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MERLIN hurries through the city gates.  The road is jammed 
      with carts and people pouring into the city.  A sea of 
      diverse multi-cultural faces much like any major city now. 

      MERLIN can barely contain his excitement.  He pushes his way 
      through the traffic, keen to taste the noisy, colourful world 
      within.  


                                                                            CUT TO:

      The city of Camelot stretches out below as MERLIN makes his 
      way along the busy thoroughfare. High on the hill above 
      stands the great citadel of Uther Pendragon.


                                                                            CUT TO:

      The sound of whistles, drums etc.  An eager and jubilant 
      CROWD is gathered in a large cobblestone square at the heart 
      of Camelot. 

      A trumpet fanfare.  MERLIN hurries to join the back of the 
      audience.  The crowd fall silent, all that can be heard is 
      the steady beat of a drum.  People shift their heads trying 
      to get a look at the spectacle that is about to take place.  
      We see a MAN, his head bowed, being ceremonially led across 
      the square.  The drum stops and we hear a voice ...

      A smiling MERLIN looks up and sees UTHER, the King.  A 
      strong, powerful warrior in his early forties standing on a 
      balcony dominating the square.   

                                  UTHER
                    Let this serve as a lesson to you 
                    all ... 
                          (he stares into the faces 
                          of the crowd)
                    This man, Thomas James Collins ...

      MERLIN cranes to find a better viewpoint...  

                                  UTHER
                    ...is adjudged guilty of conspiring 
                    to use enchantments and magic.

      MERLIN s expression of excitement pales...

                                  UTHER
                    And pursuant to the Laws of 
                    Camelot, these practices are banned 
                    by my Royal Command. 

      A murmur amongst the crowd... A figures watches the scene 
      from a narrow window high above the Square. This is MORGANA. 
      She doesn t look happy about what she sees. 

                                  UTHER
                    I pride myself as a fair and just 
                    King, but for a crime this 
                      malevolent ... there is only one 
                    sentence I can pass.  Take the 
                    prisoner forth...

                                                              MERLIN EP.1    3.



      A sudden drum roll, the crowd lean forward, straining to get  
      sight of the CONDEMNED MAN.  

      MERLIN clambers up onto a wooden scaffold supporting a 
      grandstand of temporary tiered seating, affording him a 
      better view ...  

      His P.O.V:  A brief glimpse of the CONDEMNED MAN and the 
      EXECUTIONER raising his axe, then glancing over at UTHER ...

      UTHER has his hand raised aloft, he lets it fall ...

      The EXECUTIONER takes his cue and swings his axe ....  
      Suddenly, the CROWD in front of MERLIN stand up with a roar, 
      obscuring the terrible sight.  

      We register MERLIN s shock.  

      At the window MORGANA flinches, then turns away. She can 
      watch no longer. 

        Immediately, we hear UTHER s voice booming out again over the 
      square and see him standing arms aloft ...

                                  UTHER
                    When I came to this land the 
                    Kingdom was in chaos - but we 
                    changed all that.  
                          (he smiles)
                    With your help the dragons were 
                    defeated and magic driven from the 
                    realm.  So I declare this week 
                    a holiday to celebrate ten years of 
 
                    my reign - ten yearssince the 
                    Great Dragon was captured and 
                    Camelot freed from the evil 
                    practice of sorcery!  

                          (he raises a goblet)
                    Let the celebrations begin! 

      But the cheers of approval are immediately interrupted by an 
      old woman, MARY COLLINS.  The crowd recoil at the sight of 
      her grotesque and withered face as she pushes her way into 
      the open square, shouting abuse at UTHER... 

                                  MARY COLLINS
                    There is only one evil in this land 
                    and it is not magic - it is you!  
                    Your hatred and your ignorance.

      GUARDS hurry from the crowd, circling the woman... 

                                  MARY COLLINS
                    You took my son and I warn you - 
                    before your celebrations are 
                    complete, you will share my tears!

                                  MARY COLLINS(cont'd)

                    An eye for an eye, a tooth for a 
                    tooth, a son for a son!

                                  UTHER
                          (shouting)
                    Guards, seize her!

      The GUARDS descend on the woman, but she reaches for a 
      pendant from around her neck, holds it aloft and quickly 
      mumbles a spell...

      A sudden wind whips the dust around her into a vortex; and 
      then, a split second later, both the wind and MARY COLLINS 
      are gone. Only a cloud of dust remains, floating gently 
      across the courtyard on the breeze...

      The CROWD are aghast. A very worried MERLIN shrinks away from 
      the scene...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MERLIN makes his way down a narrow corridor deep in the 
      bowels of the castle.  In contrast to the earlier regal 
      splendour, it is dark and shabby.  He spies a narrow doorway 
      marked  Court Physician .  

      MERLIN approaches the door.  It s ajar. He knocks.  No reply.  
      MERLIN lingers a moment, slightly apprehensive, then calls 
      inside ...

                                  MERLIN
                    Hello?

      Finally he decides to push the door open and peer inside...

                                                                            CUT TO:

1212
      NIGHT 1. UK/FR.

      The empty courtyard, the executioner s block and axe glint in 
      the moonlight.  MORGANA looking down over the scene through 
      the open window, a knock at the door.  

                                  UTHER (O.S)
                    Morgana?

      She turns.

                                    MORGANA
                    Yes?

      UTHER enters.  MORGANA looks at him, then moves from the 
      window.  


                                  UTHER
                    Why aren t you joining in with the 
                      celebrations?

                                    MORGANA
                    I just don t think that chopping 
                    someone s head off is a fun way to 
                    start a party.

                                    MORGANA(cont'd)

                          (beat)
                    That poor mother.

                                  UTHER
                          (a sense of something 
                            personal)
                    It is only justice for what he d 
                    done.  

                                    MORGANA
                    To whom? 

                                  UTHER
                    It is the law of the land.

                                    MORGANA
                    Your law.
                          (lightly)
                    I d be careful ...

      UTHER glances at her.

                                    MORGANA
                    The more brutal you are, the more 
                    enemies you ll create.

                                  UTHER
                    I don t fear them.

                                    MORGANA
                    Maybe you don t - but you put the 
                    rest of us in danger.

      UTHER takes this in as MORGANA turns away from the window.

                                                                            CUT TO:


1313

      A small group of tents stand silent in the moonlight, a 
      couple of guards standing on watch.

                                                                            CUT TO:


1515

      The SERGEANT steps out from the tent.  He walks a couple of 
      paces, then stops to listen.  Again we hear the sound of 
      twigs breaking under foot... The SERGEANT reaches for his 
      weapon...


                                  SERGEANT
                    Who s there?

      Another GUARD walks round the side of the tent, going about 
      his duties. The SERGEANT nods at him and heads to his own 
      tent, relieved.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      As MERLIN returns home, feeling pleased with himself and in 
      no hurry to get back. He crosses a courtyard and sees a YOUNG 
      LAD chastising his manservant, THOMAS, in front of a small 
      group of MATES (including GALAHAD and GAWAINE) who are 
      preparing to practise their combat skills ...

                                  YOUNG LAD
                          (a smile on his face)
                    Where s the target?

                                  THOMAS
                          (slightly confused)
                    There, sir.
                          (he points at it)

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    It s into the sun.

      The MAN SERVANT looks up into the sky.

                                  THOMAS
                    Well ... It s not that bright.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Bit like you, then.

      His friends laugh.  MERLIN smiles, it all seems good natured.

                                  THOMAS
                          (trying to excuse himself)
                    Well, you ve got to be able to 
                    fight in all weathers, sir.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    And what would you know about 
                    fighting.

                                  THOMAS
                    I ll put the target down the other 
                    end, shall I, sir.

      He quickly runs off to the target and picks it up ...  

                                  YOUNG LAD
                          (spying the moving target - 
                            smiling)
                    This will teach him.

      ANGLE on the MAN SERVANT carrying the target.  Suddenly, a 
      dagger hits the bull with a thud.  THOMAS reacts ...

                                  THOMAS
                    Hey!  Hang on!

      Laughter from the MATES.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Don t stop...

      THOMAS resumes walking and places the target in the shade.

                                  THOMAS
                    Here?

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    I told you to keep moving.

      THOMAS glances at him with an uncomprehending look and then 
      quickly ducks as the target is hit by another dagger ...

      More laughter.  MERLIN smile has gone, he looks awkward.  His 
      disapproval is mirrored by GWEN, watching from the windows 
      above the courtyard.  

                                  YOUNG LAD
                          (insistent)
                    Come on , we want some moving 
                    target practice.

      THOMAS picks up the target again and slowly, nervously starts 
      to walk.  He takes cover as it s hit by another dagger ... 


                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Run!

      THOMAS starts to run.  A series of daggers strike the target 
      and, in his anxiety to escape, the poor man stumbles.  The 
      target goes cartwheeling across the courtyard and lands at 
      MERLIN s feet ...

      The gang laugh ...

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Come on, pick it up again.

      The gang re-arm ...

      THOMAS nervously bends to retrieve the target, but MERLIN 
      places a foot on it - preventing him from lifting it.  

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Hurry up.

      THOMAS looks up at MERLIN.

                                  MERLIN
                          (turning to the YOUNG LAD 
                            with a smile)
                    Hey ... Come on, that s enough.

      The YOUNG LAD looks at him - clearly taking offence at 
      MERLIN s interference.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                          (wanting him to repeat it)
                    What?

      He swaggers toward MERLIN ...

                                  THOMAS
                          (to MERLIN - not wanting 
                          any trouble)
                    It s alright.

                                  MERLIN
                          (refusing to relinquish 
                          the target)
                    No.

      The YOUNG LAD comes face to face with MERLIN.  They re about 
      the same age, but MERLIN is a few sizes smaller. He looks a 
      little nervous - but holds his ground.

                                  MERLIN
                    You ve had your fun, my friend.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Do I know you?

                                  MERLIN
                    I m Merlin.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    So I don t know you.

                                  MERLIN
                    No.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    But you called me  friend .

      A beat.  An awkward silence amongst the crowd.  MERLIN can 
      see everyone looking at him.

                                  MERLIN
                    That was my mistake.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    I think so.

                                  MERLIN
                    Yeah ... I d never have a friend 
                    who could be such an arse.

      He smiles and turns away.  His audacity draws a few laughs 
      from the back of the crowd.  We see GWEN is clearly impressed 
      by MERLIN s intervention.  

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Or I, one who could be so stupid.

      He places his hand on the hilt of his sword. MERLIN sees the 
      CROWD step back.  He turns and looks at the YOUNG LAD, 
      suddenly sensing the danger he s got himself into.


                                  YOUNG LAD
                          (a smile)
                    Tell me, Merlin, d you know how to 
                    walk on your knees?

      Laughter.

                                  MERLIN
                    No.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Well, I suggest you learn.

      MERLIN holds a smile on his face - but displays a look of 
      contempt.  There s no way he s getting on his knees for this 
      idiot.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                          (an arrogant smile)
                    D you want me to help you?

      MERLIN s face hardens - 

                                  MERLIN
                      I wouldn t if I were you.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Why, what are you going to do to 
                    me?

                                  MERLIN
                    You ve no idea ...

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Be my guest.

      He towers menacingly over MERLIN.  MERLIN takes a nervous 
      step backward ... 

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Come on, then... 

      MERLIN sees the YOUNG LAD and his MATES bearing down on him. 
      Suddenly, he is in MERLIN TIME...

      EVERYTHING SLOWS, MERLIN looks at the gang, their ugly 
      gloating faces grinning at him, we hear his heart pounding 
      ... He turns his focus onto the YOUNG LAD. His eyes narrow...

      MERLIN, realising what he s doing, suddenly breaks the spell 
      and steps back... 

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    Oh, is that it?

      The crowd laugh.  MERLIN, humiliated, spins round and aims a 
      punch at him, but the YOUNG LAD swiftly parries, grabs 
      MERLIN S arm and twists it up behind his back.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    I ll have you thrown in jail for 
                    that.

                                  MERLIN
                    Who d you think you are - the king!

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    No, I m his son - Arthur.

      MERLIN, realising the young lad s identity, swallows hard.

                                  YOUNG LAD
                    On your knees.

      He kicks MERLIN on the back of his legs, MERLIN crumples to 
      his knees and, before he can backtrack, he's surrounded by a 
      group of SOLDIERS and bundled to the ground.

                                                                            CUT TO:

2222

      Dawn.  The sun is crowning the castle walls, the mist lifting 
      into the sky - giving the castle an eerie, unearthly quality 
      ... 

                                                                            CUT TO:


2424

      MERLIN s head in the stocks.  A large rotten tomato skims his 
      face.  He looks up at GAIUS ungratefully ...

                                  MERLIN
                    Thanks.

      A gang of eager CHILDREN arrive armed with sacks of rotten 
      veg.

                                  MERLIN
                    Oh, Charlemagne!

      Everything imaginable is hurled at MERLIN ...

      As MERLIN takes his punishment, we see GWEN looking on 
        sympathetically.  She grimaces, feeling each shot as it hits 
      poor MERLIN.  

      The CHILDREN finally run out of ammo and head off.  MERLIN s 
      face is dripping with rancid pulp, he opens his eyes to find 
      GWEN gently wiping his face clean.  

      GWEN gives him a lovely smile, clearly smitten ... MERLIN 
      smiles grimly back at her. 

                                  GWEN
                    I m Gwenhwyfer.  But most people 
                    call me Gwen.

                                  MERLIN
                    Right.  I m Merlin...  

      MERLIN halfheartedly waggles a hand in the stocks - offering 
      her a handshake. GWEN responds and sweetly shakes it.

                                  MERLIN
                    Although most people call me 
                     idiot .

                                  GWEN
                    No, I saw what you did.  It was so 
                    brave.

                                  MERLIN
                          (dismayed)
                    It was stupid...

                                  GWEN
                    Well, I m glad you walked away, you 
                    weren t going to beat him.


                                  MERLIN
                    Oh, I could beat him.

                                  GWEN
                          (impressed)
                    Yeah?  You think?  Because you 
                    don t look like one of those big 
                    muscly fellows ... 

                                  MERLIN
                    Thanks.

                                  GWEN
                    No... I m sure you re stronger than 
                    you look ...

      MERLIN glances at her ...

                                  GWEN
                    It s just Arthur s one of those 
                    real rough tough save the world 
                    kind of men and, well ...

      MERLIN gives her another glance.

                                  MERLIN
                    What?

                                  GWEN
                    You don t look like that.

                                  MERLIN
                    I m in disguise.

                                  GWEN
                          (she smiles)
                    Well, it was great you stood up to 
                    him.  

                                  MERLIN
                    You think so?

                                  GWEN
                    Arthur s a bully.  And everyone 
                    thought you were a real hero.

                                  MERLIN
                    Oh yeah?  Excuse me ...
                          (he waves her aside)
                    My fans are waiting.

      Another barrage of rotten apples hits the stocks.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


2525

      UTHER stands on the battlements showing off his kingdom to 
      DAME HELEN.

                                  UTHER
                    Maybe one day I ll build a new 
                    palace here - Fit for a Queen.

      He looks at DAME HELEN.

                                  DAME HELEN
                          (she smiles)
                    What Queen would not be happy here?  
                    It s already so perfect.

                                  UTHER
                    No, I want it gone, to start anew.

      DAME HELEN looks intrigued. He sees her.

                                  UTHER
                    There are too many ghosts here.
                          (a beat)
                    I ve been at war for so much of my 
                    life.  And yet these bricks, these 
                    walls will live on far longer than 
                    my deeds.  Have I built a Camelot 
                    that will stand as a testimony to 
                    my reign; a legacy that will be 
                      remembered?
                          (a beat)
                    What kind of King am I?

                                  DAME HELEN
                    A very attractive one.

                                  UTHER
                          (he smiles)
                    Do I have the love of my people?

                                  DAME HELEN
                    I can only speak for one of your 
                    subjects.

                                  UTHER
                          (his smile spreading)
                    What favours would you have me 
                    bestow on you?

      DAME HELEN laughs and moves away.  He pursues her.

                                  UTHER
                    I warn you I am ruthless ...
                    I do not let anything stand in my

3232

      MERLIN hurrying from the Keep and entering the busy 
      thoroughfare.  Suddenly, he sees ARTHUR and his ENTOURAGE 
      heading toward him.  They look at each other, MERLIN can t 
      avoid him ...

      They come face to face, MERLIN tries to keep walking.  ARTHUR 
      blocks his path ...

                                  ARTHUR
                          (smiling)
                    How s your knee walking coming 
                    along?

      MERLIN keeps going.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Ah, don t run away.

                                  MERLIN
                          (disparaging)
                    From you?  

      MERLIN turns on him ...

                                  MERLIN
                    I ve told you, you re an arse - I 
                    just didn t know you were a Royal 
                    one.

      A few GUARDS react...

                                  MERLIN
                    What you going to do - get your 
                    dad s men to protect you?

                                  ARTHUR
                          (smiling)
                    I could take you apart with one 
                    blow.

      He puckers his lips and blows ...

      MERLIN stares at him.  There s no going back ...

                                  MERLIN
                    I could take you apart with less 
                    than that.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Are you sure?

      ARTHUR smiles and he tears off his top.  MERLIN looks at him - 
      he's ripped like 50 Cent.  MERLIN swallows hard ... 

      He removes his own top - it's not quite so impressive.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Here you go, big man.  

      ARTHUR takes a pair of evil looking maces from the GUARDS and 
      throws one to MERLIN.  MERLIN fumbles it.  The gathering 
      CROWD laugh, further angering MERLIN.  The two lads square up 
      for a fight.  ARTHUR smiles, confident that he s going to 
      give MERLIN a whipping ...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Come on, then.

      ARTHUR begins expertly twirling the mace round his body at 
      high speed - like some ninja martial art expert.  It s a 
      frightening display and the CROWD roar their approval.  

      Finally, ARTHUR brings the mace to a halt ...

                                  ARTHUR
                          (a smile)
                    I warn you I ve been trained to 
                    kill since birth.

                                  MERLIN
                    Wow - and how long have you been 
                    training to be a bully?

                                  ARTHUR
                          (forced to smile at his 
                            audacity)
                    You can t address me like that.

                                  MERLIN
                    Sorry - how long have you been 
                    training to be a bully, my Lord?

      ARTHUR reacts and suddenly arcs a high sweeping blow at 
      MERLIN ...

      MERLIN ducks and comes up wide eyed ... 

                                                                            CUT TO:

3535

      MERLIN and ARTHUR are going at it hammer and tongs... To the 
      CROWD S amusement, MERLIN is inept; all he can do is duck, 
      parry and retreat along the busy street - he s clearly no 
      fighter.   

      As ARTHUR s blows rain down, MERLIN suddenly crashes into a 
      fruit stall.  MERLIN falls backwards, sending the produce 
      flying ... 

      He looks up.  ARTHUR appears to have him at his mercy, he 
      raises his arm about to apply the coup de grace ...

                                  MERLIN
                    Oh ... Charlemagne!

      We hear MERLIN s heart beating and we re in MERLIN TIME...

      MERLIN s eyes flare and he looks up at an awning billowing in 
      the wind above ARTHUR s head.  

      We see the structure move ...

      ARTHUR arcs a blow toward MERLIN, the mace catches the awning 
      and is ripped from his hand...

      ARTHUR reacts with surprise, reaches up into the awning to 
      retrieve his mace...

      MERLIN takes his chance, rolls away and gets to his feet.  
      ARTHUR quickly grabs his mace and turns to MERLIN once 
      more...

      He s about to unleash another deadly blow.  The sound of 
      MERLIN s heart and, once again, time slows...

      As ARTHUR steps toward him, MERLIN s eyes rest upon an 
      upended wooden fruit box, his eyes blaze ...

      The box tilts at a 45 degree angle, we see ARTHUR s foot land 
      on the edge of the box, levering the top of the box toward 
      his leg ... 

      The box whacks ARTHUR in the shin.  He lets out a painful 
      yell ...

      It s MERLIN S turn to smile.  ARTHUR responds angrily and 
      lunges with another blow ...

      MERLIN s eyes gleam ... 

      A nearby ROPE snaps taut. ARTHUR trips over it and crashes to 
      the floor, losing his mace.

      The CROWD laugh.  MERLIN s grin intensifies - we are in no 
      doubt that the rope was his work ...


      ARTHUR gets up with a smile - he can see the funny side.  He 
      reaches for his weapon, but MERLIN swings his own mace.  
      Without a weapon to defend himself, it s ARTHUR s turn to 
      retreat...

      ARTHUR makes several lunges for the mace, but MERLIN drives 
      him back - enjoying the upper-hand.  

                                  MERLIN
                    D you want to give up?

      ARTHUR, displaying his own natural speed of thought, grabs 
      the bellows from the ironmonger s stall.  He aims it at the 
      furnace and slaps the handles together - sending a blast of 
      burning embers into the air.  MERLIN jumps back as the spray 
      of sparks hit him ...

                                  ARTHUR
                    I told you I d take you apart with 
                    just one blow.

      ARTHUR snatches up the ironmonger s hammer and aims it at 
      MERLIN. MERLIN steps back, but collides with a wooden post.  
      He ducks, the hammer embeds itself in the post.  MERLIN 
      stares at the hammer, we hear his heart beating ...  

      MERLIN TIME:  ARTHUR tries to withdraw the hammer from the 
      wood - he can t.   

      MERLIN and ARTHUR stare at each other.  ARTHUR uses all his 
      might to try to release the hammer, but it seems to be held 
      by magic - which of course it is.

      The CROWD give an audible intake of breath as MERLIN aims a 
      blow at the defenceless ARTHUR, sweeping his feet from under 
      him ...

      ARTHUR hits the ground and, in the space he s vacated, MERLIN 
      suddenly comes face to face with GAIUS watching on the 
      sidelines.  MERLIN sees the angry expression on GAIUS  face.  
      He knows he has to stop using magic. 

      ARTHUR recovers, gets up and throws himself at MERLIN; 
      disarming him in the process...

      Now MERLIN is defenceless, he looks at ARTHUR armed with his 
      mace, then looks at GAIUS - what s he going to do now?  
      ARTHUR takes a swing, MERLIN s face is gripped with panic...

      MERLIN lets out a yell as he is struck in the midrift.  He 
      doubles up, winded by the blow.  ARTHUR stands over him...


                                  ARTHUR
                    There s something about you, Merlin 
                    - I can t quite put my finger on 
                    it.

      We see ARTHUR lift his fist and swing a punch - BLACKOUT.

                                                                            CUT TO:


3838

      The spires and turrets of Camelot silhouetted against a full 
      moon. 

                                                                            CUT TO:




4444

      Bright sunshine beats down on Camelot - the sun has risen and 
      it s the start of a new day.

                                                                            CUT TO:


4848

      The stark shapes of thorny trees, mist wreathing the ground. 
      MERLIN begins picking herbs and flowers for Gaius. As he 
      moves through the trees, we catch sight of a lake nearby...

      MERLIN nears the sound of a woman singing ...

      MERLIN peeks through the trees, straining for a view of the 
      singer...

      He catches sight of a figure - DAME HELEN, bathing in the 
      water.

      MERLIN can t resist stepping closer to get a better look ...

      The song intensifies as he approaches the water...

      But as MERLIN reaches the lake, the song stops.  Silence.

      MERLIN s P.O.V:  The water rippling on the surface of the 
      empty lake. There s no one in sight.


      MERLIN looks slightly puzzled, then starts to head back in 
      the direction of Camelot...

      Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him. He spins round and 
      finds himself face to face with the grotesque face of MARY 
      COLLINS reflected in the lake.

      MERLIN jumps back, his heart stops.  He looks around, all 
      about him tall rocks.

      He looks at the way ahead, he senses someone is there.  A 
      beat.

      Slowly, nervously, he starts edging his way backwards, the 
      way he came.  As he moves we feel something behind him, a 
      shadow...

      Suddenly, MERLIN turns and pulls back in alarm.  DAME HELEN 
      is barring his way.

                                  DAME HELEN
                    Are you spying on me?

                                  MERLIN
                    No.
                          (nervous)
                    I was picking herbs.

      A moment.  MERLIN quickly scrambles away - clearly unsettled 
      by what he s seen...

      He hurries back to the path and glances back over his 
      shoulder...

      DAME HELEN has gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:
