OAKLAND BRIDGE.
SAN FRANCISCO BAY.
DUSK.
High above the Golden Gate. Too high for specifics. But there
is something down there of interest to the Camera. Descending
with the Music it seems to isolate a particular car. Too many
and too distant to know which it is. But the Camera is follow-
ing and already a mile up the 101 Interstate travelling north.
Maybe via a dissolve. And maybe not. But red and white either
way as the headlights are coming on. The Camera is closing on
the highway. And a car has definitely been selected. There is
nothing much of interest about it. It's a blue Mercedes sedan.
Mussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts. The first
puts the frame directly in front of the car. In a few moments
its brights snap up. And Titles continue in a dazzle of light.
3:
FREEWAY INTERSECTION.
DUSK.
An instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway. A
heavy sky of red and black cloud. The Mercedes turns off head-
ing east. This time the Camera doesn't follow. Remains static
over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear.
5:
OPEN END GARAGE AND YARD.
HOUSE.
DAWN.
In the garage he finds the gas cylinder.
Empty and so is the
bastard with it. He drags fingers through hair in frustration.
Looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out. The
view beyond he hardly cares to look at.
But if he does it is
as follows.
Clouds massing on the horizon. Fields getting re-
ady for rain.
His nearest neighbor is around 200 yards away.
His nearest Cow about 50. This house is remote and rural look-
ing with a veranda out back. But BERLIN has no inclination for
sight-seeing. As he walks away a dreary female Voice seeps in.
8:
HILLSIDE.
SPRINGFIELD STREET.
EUREKA.
DAY.
A Chevrolet zig-zags up a shabby canyon. It's the road to the
city dump. Its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage
trucks. Everything is backed up. Nothing moves except the car.
The cause of the hold-up is explained at the top. A Sheriff's
car blocks the road. A Uniform moves to wave the Chevrolet in.
10:
ENTRANCE/TRACK/INFILL.
CITY DUMP.
EUREKA.
DAY.
The car parks at a weigh-house and a man in his 50's gets out.
Looks like he hasn't slept in a while. And got the mood to go
with it. Sports jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of laugh lines
around the eyes. But you wouldn't want to get arrested by him.
And especially not this morning. His name is FREDERICK T ROSS.
TRAVIS
You can drive down there, Sir ..
ROSS
I'm already walking. Where is it?
One of those walking with him is a 10-year-old Kid with a Dog.
TRAVIS looks almost too young to own his struggling moustache.
TRAVIS
On the infill. The guy from
L.A.'s just gone down there ..
ROSS
He has? .. What's he doing here?
TRAVIS
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait-
ed a good while. Said he'd go down
and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
The track sinks through a valley of a million discarded tires.
ROSS
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of
luck I'm goin home. What we got?
TRAVIS
A derelict.
TRIMBLE
They cut his throat ..
The information comes from freckles and a missing front tooth.
ROSS
Who are you?
TRIMBLE
Trimble.
He wears glasses and wields a rusty .22 pump-action Remington.
ROSS
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
TRAVIS
His father's the manager, Sir.
The kid was up there shooting
vermin, and he found the body.
TRIMBLE
Get ready for it, coz I'm tell-
ing ya, you're in for a shock ..
TRIMBLE speaks with some enthusiasm. ROSS looks back with none.
They slit him from "ear to ear."
Ya want me to make a statement?
ROSS
Not right now. No. Thank you.
11:
WORKING FACE.
INFILL.
GARBAGE DUMP.
DAY.
A series of terraces have been created as the canyon fills up.
Black smoke drifts from a distance at will of the wind. Gulls
and bulldozers. Plus a stinking ten foot cliff of human filth.
Several cars parked here including the blue Mercedes. Several
On Lookers behind yellow police tape. ROSS negotiates it look-
ing pissed off. Looks up and somewhere in the smoke is BERLIN.
ROSS
Did you bring it with you?
BERLIN
I hope I'm not intruding?
ROSS
Be my guest. What you got?
BERLIN
Old guy, offed himself with a
knife. I can't find the knife.
And the next thing ROSS is looking at is a death in the trash.
A massive dozer in the background. Everything else is garbage.
TRIMBLE
They cut his throat.
ROSS
Would you get outside the tape.
And tell your dad to put that
fire out ... that ain't legal ...
Another face here is so familiar ROSS hasn't bothered to ackn-
owledge it. BLATTIS is a 32 year old local newspaper reporter.
Little is visible of the body except a blood-stained raincoat.
TRAVIS
I wonder what would make
him do a thing like that?
ROSS
Don't annoy me, Travis.
TRAVIS
No, Sir.
Truck horns wail in the distance. On the horizon it's thunder.
ROSS
So where's the knife?
BERLIN wears surgical gloves. Removes film from a small camera.
BERLIN
I dunno .. Guess the dozer
musta shifted him? You need
some hands up here to look ..
ROSS
You heard. Look for the knife.
Swatting smoke ROSS directs anger at a fat cop called VENABLES.
You, too .. Move that ass ..
BERLIN hands the film to ROSS as he gets into identical gloves.
You done the pockets?
BERLIN
No, Sir. I haven't started
till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
ROSS
"Welcome to Eureka."
By now ROSS is crouched next to the Corpse examining the wound.
How long's he been feeling like this?
BERLIN
Week or two.
Musta been on the ker-
osene.
Stinks like a diesel engine.
BLATTIS
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
ROSS
Mr Blattis, of our local news-
paper. You sure it's a suicide?
BERLIN
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
BLATTIS
What does that mean, Sergeant?
BERLIN
Cut your own throat, you're ner-
vous about it, tend to hesitate.
He's got three trial cuts, lower
left side of the neck, before he
works up courage for the big one.
BLATTIS looks vaguely impressed. ROSS begins searching pockets.
BLATTIS
You think Popeye would know that?
ROSS
I don't think Popeye would be here.
VENABLES (V.O.)
Dead dog over here, Sir ...
ROSS
Find the knife. And Venab-
les, is the coroner called?
VENABLES
Yes, Sir .. He's delayed ..
BLATTIS
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna
leave you. I got a couple of
questions for the paper, Serg-
eant? Mind if I swing by later,
wring out a tea-bag with you?
BERLIN
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
BLATTIS
Your predecessor. He did-
n't like to get outta bed.
Catch you later, Freddy T ..
Off he fucks under an ailing sky. BERLIN lands a friendly grin.
BERLIN
So what happened to the
barbecues, and fishing?
ROSS
Watch my lips, coz you're not
gonna believe this - this is
a rare occurrence. We haven't
had a body in eighteen months.
He finds keys and change and a sandwich in the Wino's raincoat.
How does anyone dead
as this lose a knife?
BERLIN
What about that kid, Ross?
ROSS
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.
(Stands to shout)
Travis. Find that kid and get
the knife off him. He's gonna
lie to you - but he's got it -
so get it. Well, go on, get on
with it. Whatta you staring at?
TRAVIS stares up like he just stuck his dick in a light socket.
TRAVIS
I think I found some-
thing horrible, Sir
ROSS
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
TRAVIS
I think I've found a hand.
12:
INFILL.
GARBAGE DUMP.
DAY.
ROSS crouches in garbage. Peers into a trash sack with assist-
ance of a flashlight. "You're right. It's a fucken hand." Pas-
ses the light to BERLIN. His turn to examine the ruptured bag.
BERLIN
Looks like a woman's hand?
BERLIN finally stands. Offs the flashlight. And hands it back.
ROSS
What do you think?
BERLIN
I think you're here all day.
13:
INFILL.
GARBAGE DUMP.
DAY.
Pissing with rain and unspeakably miserable.
The 'grid-search'
is in progress and 50 square yards of the dump have been ripp-
ed to pieces. Intermittent voices from police radios. More veh-
icles down below including an ambulance with hazards revolving.
Up here half a dozen arc-lights scald off vapor. BERLIN search-
es under a busted umbrella. Looks up and runs into ROSS's eyes.
ROSS
How much longer we here? We're
not gonna find nothing else .. ?
He wears a rubber cape & looks like a huge pissed-off Napoleon.
BERLIN
We give it one more hour. Did
the photographer do the dogs?
ROSS
The dogs?
BERLIN
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
And both turn towards a Voice shouting from deep in the gloom.
VENABLES
Sergeant - we got a brassiere over
here. Looks like it could be blood.
ROSS
Oh, shit.
BERLIN
Alright, I'm coming ..
Another intrusion from the radio. TRAVIS repeats the question.
TRAVIS
The coroner wants to know if
we can release the derelict?
ROSS
Ask him.
BERLIN
Yeah, he can go ...
ROSS
Think I'll lay down with him.
Only way I'll get outta here.
Did someone say something funny? Does BERLIN just about smile.
BERLIN
It's good to be with you, Ross.
And this is probably the only time ROSS will look happy today.
ROSS
Glad you finally made it, Bro ...
14:
CAR PARK.
POLICE STATION.
CITY OF EUREKA.
DAY.
The Mercedes descends an incline and parks. Brown Chevys and
black & white patrol cars. Dismal lights and raining like it
doesn't end. BERLIN gets out and unloads the trunk (aquarium
& insulated picnic box). Slams the trunk and reveals BLATTIS.
BLATTIS
You want some umbrella?
Proffers a big yellow one plus assistance carrying equipment.
BERLIN
Is this normal?
BLATTIS
Average rainfall, 48 inches.
Pisses down, October to June.
Raining hard enough to hurt. A brisk intimacy across the lot.
Better in the summer.
You
get to fucka few tourists ..
He hits a security code at the door. Obviously familiar with
the station. Dialogue continues as they step into a corridor.
15:
LANDSCAPE/ROAD.
TRINITY FOREST.
DAY.
Mussorgsky is back on a shock cut. Big music and a shattering
landscape. Juniper woods and mountains. Sunlight on fresh fal-
len snow. Somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley.
Ross's car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches
it away. An unexpected building in the distance. Victorian at
a glance but probably later. A clock tower and fifty lifeless
windows. The Chevy disappears towards its somber architecture.
29:
THE SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.
DAY.
Pine trees and slush and parked cars. The Chevrolet swings in
and parks in front of the mansion. Breath in the air and eyes
on the ugly pile as they slam doors and head for its entrance.
30:
CITY DUMP.
CITY OF EUREKA.
NIGHT.
Gloom congeals around flashlights. A winter mist falling down.
TRIMBLE and Doberman watch as BERLIN goes at it with a shovel.
A dozen graves already dug and he's halfway into another. Des-
pite the cold he sweats in shirt sleeves. Also breathless and
rests to catch his wind. "Don't you have to go to bed?" No he
doesn't. He wants to see the victim. Digging recommences with
TRIMBLE supplying the light. BERLIN suddenly stops. "Get that
lamp down here." White lime. Black fur. They've found the Dog.
BERLIN begins an examination holding a tiny flashlight in his
teeth. Eyes excitedly back to TRIMBLE and gesturing towards a
bag. "That bag there. You find a knife and a paira long-nosed
pliers." TRIMBLE does it relishing the snap of a switch-blade.
BERLIN still busy with the light in his mouth. TRIMBLE pissed
because he can't see what's happening. BERLIN removes a crump-
led bullet from the back of the Labrador's skull. Holds it up
for scrutiny. Small calibre. Badly distorted. "Looks like a 22?"
BERLIN
You didn't shoot him did you?
TRIMBLE
Me .. I love dogs .. Ask him?
37:
COAST ROAD.
HUMBOLDT BAY.
EUREKA.
DAY.
The first shining day of November. Sand dunes and an infinite
stretch of beach. Behind the sea-break is a lagoon and a tiny
harbor.
Berlin's Mercedes descends the coast road towards it.
39:
HARBOR.
HUMBOLDT BAY.
EUREKA.
DAY.
Ross's boat is a 35 foot fisherman. Shining brass and varnish.
But like him it's getting on and often grumpy. This last qual-
ity presently evident in both. Engine roaring and ROSS is cov-
ered in oil. BERLIN has to shout above the racket to be heard.
BERLIN
.. I put the slug in for a ballis-
tics report, the man tells me, for
get it. Soft lead, it's worthless ..
I think, fuck it. And fuck Citrine.
I call a friend of mine in Los Ang-
eles, and he runs our whole damned
show through a main-frame looking
for anything similar to our ladies
shot with a twenty-two - you don't
believe what he finds in San Diego ..
ROSS detours eyes to wave at his Son. "Watch those revs there."
Would you shut it down a min-
ute, Ross? This is important.
ROSS signals BOBBY to turn off. And the diesel splutters down.
ROSS
Alright, let's take a walk around
the block .. I gotta buy a gasket ..
40:
QUAY/HARBOR.
HUMBOLDT BAY.
DAY.
Seagulls and sunshine and probably Saturday because the place
is busy. ROSS walks with BERLIN up a wooden quay. Their journ-
ey will take them across a small bridge towards a Marine Shop.
BERLIN
Six girls over a period of 18
months, and give or take a head
or two, the M.O.'s exactly the
same. Dark hair. No hands. All
shot with a high velocity twen-
ty-two in the back of the head.
ROSS
How come the F.B.I. don't put
anya this together? They work-
ed over "Jennifer" for months?
BERLIN
They possibly did - but they nev-
er had a head, so they never had
a bullet - and they never got an
I.D. - not on any of em - never
bust a homicide unless you know
who your victim is - we're the
first to get a positive identity.
ROSS
Identity of whom? You got a girl,
doesn't even have a driver's lic-
ense? .. She's untraceable, John ..
You need fifty detectives on this.
BERLIN
That's what I'm here for. I want
you to come and see Citrine with
me?
He's not gonna here it from
me but I know he'd listen to you.
ROSS
Listen to me saying what?
BERLIN
I wanna take that fucking Blind In-
stitute to pieces .. Every address
book, every phone call, everyone in
and outta there in the last 5 years ..
ROSS
For a dead dog?
BERLIN
We've fused into a major series,
Ross. This girl isn't the second
victim. This is "Jennifer Eight."
And this is the second time they stop and stare at each other.
That old Wino on the heap wasn't
a suicide. He stumbled into some-
thing, saw something, and whoever
took him out knew how to fake it.
ROSS
That isn't what you said before.
BERLIN
I was wrong.
Says it with remarkable humility considering he's the "expert."
I'm going in to see Citrine this
afternoon. Will you come with me?
ROSS
You're not .. He's in hospital ..
He was trying out a new pair of
skis in his hallway. The phone
rings, and he goes for it, and
falls off. He must be the only
skier in Northern California to
break a leg in his living room.
They arrive at the Chandler's with BERLIN in no mood to smile.
BERLIN
You believe me, don't you?
ROSS
What does it matter what I bel-
ieve? .. What you gotta worry
about is what Citrine believes ..
But he doesn't really believe it. And doesn't enjoy saying no.
But I can't help you with this. We
can't go through the door with two
contentious issues, you with a mass
murderer, and me with the Mayor's
best friend. Do that, we lose both.
I'm sorry, Bro, you're on your own.
41:
TRINITY VALLEY.
DAY.
(HELICOPTER)
The Mercedes and Music travel north. The latter made sinister
by this landscape. Forest plunging into dark ravines. The sun
colors the mountains red. But most of the valley is in shadow.
42:
DRIVE/PARKING.
SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.
DAY.
A high wind in the chimneys. And the view is still from above.
Like someone's looking down from the top of the building. And
maybe someone is? BERLIN parks it and gets out. Stretches and
walks towards the institute. He looks very small from up here.
43:
FIRE ESCAPE/APARTMENT.
INSTITUTE.
DUSK.
BERLIN looks down from the fire escape. For the first time the
place sounds busy. Cars arriving and doors slamming. Voices of
Students coming back from the weekend. "Why were you out there?"
HELENA waits inside and didn't realize he was back in the room.
HELENA
Coz I wanted to feel the snow
on my face .. I think that's
when I heard her call him John?
Time to go and both know it. Stale shadows and growing silence.
Is it snowing now?
BERLIN
No. Getting dark though.
And his eyes are searching her so hard she must be aware of it.
You think you'd know this man? If
he was in the room with you again?
HELENA
You've already asked me that ..
The silence is almost uncomfortable. BERLIN continues to stare.
Amber's dead, isn't she?
BERLIN
Yes. I'm sorry.
50:
SUBURBAN STREET.
CITY OF EUREKA.
DAY.
Pretty houses in a pretty little street. Hills in the back and
sunshine out front. BERLIN pulls up in his Mercedes and does a
bit of tie adjusting as he walks up a path and hits the chimes.
This could only be MRS CITRINE. A budget smile and he's inside.
51:
ROSS'S BOAT.
HUMBOLDT BAY.
EUREKA.
DAY.
A wave atomizes and comes down like silver champagne. HELENA &
BERLIN hang on the prow of the boat with the ocean rushing bel-
ow. Another wave and more spray for HELENA. She turns like get-
ting sea in your face is the best invention ever. Oilskins sat-
urated and her hair streaming and she knows he's loving it too.
57:
FISHING DECK ABOVE WHEELHOUSE.
BOAT.
DAY.
Wind over and sea content and anchored about a mile from shore.
Smoke from a dying barbecue and Nat King Cole croons "Unforget-
able." ROSS sports shades and sits staring down the line. Some-
one plays lousy guitar and he shifts eyes into the well of the
boat. HELENA teaches BOBBY to play chords. Hardly worth the ef-
fort but they're enjoying it. BERLIN looks down from the oppos-
ite side of the deck. His gaze interrupted by MARGIE "You want
another Coke, honey?" Sure he does and her eyes travel to ROSS.
MARGIE
You want something, darling?
ROSS
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
In code so BERLIN won't understand. But he and ROSS swap grins.
How much longer you on that diet?
BERLIN
I'm doing it by the day ...
MARGIE climbs the stairs with drinks and drinks a beer herself.
Popped cans change the subject. This seems like a question BER-
LIN doesn't really want to ask & MARGIE doesn't want to answer.
How's your little sister?
MARGIE
She's in Europe ..
BERLIN
Working?
Clearly a sensitive subject and ROSS decides the truth is best.
ROSS
She married some English prick.
MARGIE
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
ROSS
Got a handshake like a
partially excited penis.
The joke doesn't reach BERLIN. MARGIE's hand is on his shoulder.
MARGIE
Her loss, darlin ..
And she heads for the lower deck. A sweet smile as she descends.
Anyway, you're doing O.
K. She's a sweet heart.
And also playing the guitar "In My Life." And she does it well.
ROSS
Why's she blind, Bro?
BERLIN
Car accident.
Slow banging of something swaying. And this exchange goes slow.
Whole family wiped out.
ROSS
No shit.
A bleeper goes on one of the lines and ROSS twists in his seat.
Strap me in. Here comes another.
And he winds in yet another three quarters of a pound Mackerel.
Worst day's fishing I ever had ..
BERLIN
It's been a great day.
ROSS dexterously extracts the hook with serious eyes on BERLIN.
ROSS
You just go easy, Brother ...
(Looks at fish)
Alright, we're all goin home.
59:
CAR PARK AT BEACH.
DUSK.
Darkness in about an hour. Wide over the car park. Sand dunes
surround it. Practically deserted of cars. Headlights snap on
focusing attention on a station wagon exchange of good-byes.
HELENA (V.O.)
I really liked Margie ..
Silhouettes with exaggerated shadows walk across the car park.
What does she do?
BERLIN (V.O.)
She runs a kind of hair dress-
ing and you know, beauty salon ..
HELENA (V.O.)
Have you known her long?
BERLIN (V.O.)
I was married to her sister ..
The angle changes and is closer now. HELENA has taken his arm.
You don't ask what I'm like?
HELENA
I know what you're like ..
BERLIN
How d'you know what I'm like?
HELENA
Ross told me.
BERLIN
Really? What did he say?
HELENA
He said you're quite chubby.
And you have a nervous tick.
BERLIN
He said that? What else did
he say?
HELENA
Just your age.
BERLIN
Which is what?
HELENA
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
BERLIN is more amused than annoyed. They arrive at the car and
his suggestion is met with an appropriate response from HELENA.
BERLIN
You wanna drive? C'mon we're
in a car park, miles from any-
where .. There's nothing arou-
nd but nothing and sand dunes ..
"I can't drive a car." Doesn't like cars. But he's not hearing.
C'mon it'll be fun. You can
drive me around in circles ..
No lady ever had a driving lesson like this before. BERLIN all
but sits in her seat. Arm on the back of it. Hand on the wheel.
For a split second they're doing 60. Now they're doing about 4.
The Mercedes spirals in widening circles. Instructions and enc-
ouragement from BERLIN .. O.K. .. Straight now .. The Mercedes
straightens and heads through the dunes. "It's a big car park?"
We're going along a little track.
HELENA may like driving but she doesn't like the sound of that.
It's O.K. It's not a public road.
Headlights behind them approach quickly. Disappear and reappear
as they follow the geography of the dunes. BERLIN only now bec-
omes aware of them. one more dip and they slam in. Her anxiety
is misinterpreted. He takes the wheel. No problem. Let him pass.
The vehicle is right up behind them. As it overtakes HELENA is
scared. And still scared even though BERLIN has stopped the car.
It's alright, I'm sorry. It was
my fault, it wasn't a good idea.
HELENA
That was the "Hollow Car," John.
Just time to see tail lights of a van disappearing in the gloom.
BERLIN
A Volkswagen van? Are you sure?
CITY STREET.
CITY OF EUREKA.
NIGHT.
Colored lights strung across the street. Symptoms of Christmas
everywhere. Store windows full of trashy decorations and every-
thing soluable in mist. ROSS and BERLIN develop out of it like
Polaroids. Their destination is a dingy looking downstairs bar.
BERLIN
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
ROSS
No God, Brother. If there was
a God, asses wouldn't be at
the perfect height for kicking.
63:
ROAD.
TRINITY VALLEY.
DAY.
The mood is low as it goes. And so is the angle. Ultra low beh-
ind the car. Just road and a blur of tires. The frame widens &
the Mercedes fills it. Brake lights on as it descends the hill.
70:
(P.O.V. FROM FIRE ESCAPE)
INSTITUTE.
DUSK.
Not a lot to look at but the man is looking in. From his P.O.V.
he's fortunate. HELENA sits facing him but BERLIN has his back
to the window. This sort of surveillance is always ominous and
here is no exception. BERLIN's explanation comes with occasion-
al use of hands. HELENA suddenly smiles so it can't be all bad.
They stand and BERLIN reaches for his coat. HELENA crosses the
room. Finds her Forget-Me-Nots and now they're his at the door.
As he takes them he takes her hand. Kisses her finger tips and
can't avoid embracing her. They kiss like awkward kids bumping
noses. Finally part and disappear into the dark of the hallway.
77:
VOLKSWAGEN VAN/CAR PARK.
DINER.
NIGHT.
BERLIN checks the driver's door. Locked and he explores with a
pencil-flashlight. Moves to a slide door at the side. Simultan-
eously the door to the Diner opens releasing a quartet of midd-
le-aged Drunks. He dissolves while they bullshit around. Laugh-
ter in chill air. The Comedian of the night keeps himself amus-
ed. Jokes about getting into the wrong car with the wrong wife.
BERLIN isn't laughing "C'mon, you drunken fuck. Get outta here."
81:
VOLKSWAGEN VAN/CAR PARK.
DINER.
NIGHT.
A slide door rolls open and BERLIN peers in. Full of furniture
and cardboard crates stenciled "TRINITY INSTITUTE - CRAFT DEPT."
Worth the try but forget it. This bastard obviously has legit-
imate business at the institute. Takes a last poke around with
the light. Spots something red. A cigarette butt caked in lip-
stick. But what's this white stuff? Some kind of powder spills
from a capsule crushed in the door rails. He picks it up for a
look and gets a bad one from behind! "Whatta you doing, Mister?"
BERLIN finds himself facing an irate looking Woman in her 20's.
A lot of red hair and freckles. But definitely more frightened
than angry. His Police Department badge is an instant sedative.
Gives her some crap about thefts from vehicles round here. She
should keep her doors locked. She smiles and thought they were.
BERLIN
Got your driver's license?
She hands it across and he inspects it coz that's what cops do.
I noticed you coming outta the
institute. You up there a lot?
WOMAN
Oh, it was you that
nearly ran into me?
BERLIN
No, it was you that nearly ran
into me .. You up there a lot?
WOMAN
I guess, more than usual this
time of the year. My mother & I
run an Arts & Crafts center, we
buy a lot from the institutes ..
BERLIN
Where's your store, Amanda?
WOMAN
Oakland.
Hands the license back and is already heading for his Mercedes.
BERLIN
Next pit-stop, you make sure your
doors are locked.
Merry Christmas.
82:
YARD.
HOUSE.
DAY.
BERLIN clears rubbish from the garage. Grime and sweat and the
effort's got him breathless. Heaves another armful on the fire.
The phone starts ringing again. This time he decides to answer.
85:
LANDSCAPE.
COUNTRY ROAD.
DAY.
Wide over the countryside. The car is a long way off. A pretty
magic looking dawn. Cows on hills and mist in the hollows. The
Mercedes finally arrives. Up the track and into the (refurbish-
ed) garage. Engine off and little but a sound of singing birds.
88:
WOODSHED.
BERLIN'S HOUSE.
DAY.
BERLIN is splitting logs and HELENA is sitting an a step "watch-
ing" him. She's looking almost happy with only worry in the way.
BERLIN
You're looking worried again, Helena?
HELENA
No I'm not.
BERLIN
You're looking more worried now than
when you "decided to stop worrying"?
HELENA
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas.
I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
A log tangents off. BERLIN retrieves it. Tosses it in a barrow.
BERLIN
He'll get over it. I'll roast
us a chicken, O.K.
With cand-
les around it. How about that?
A distant owl hoots. She knows he's smiling. She's smiling too.
HELENA
Wouldn't it be better if I cook
it? You said, you can only boil?
90:
KITCHEN/REAR ENTRANCE.
ROSS'S HOUSE.
DAY.
Is Ross throwing a party or opening a bar? Crates of booze and
stack upon stack of beer. A bit of "where do you want it?" act-
ing from BERLIN as he staggers in with a delivery of Bud. ROSS
makes room on a table. Rips a beer out the plastic and pops it.
BERLIN
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
ROSS
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Swallowing beer ROSS exits the back door with BERLIN following.
It's her invitation. And as
far as Citrine in concerned,
better we keep it like that.
The wagon waits outside with a few crates left to unload, BER-
LIN heads for his Mercedes with ROSS calling after him. "John.
Here." Pulls a six pack from his supplies and throws it across.
There's an old desperado in
one of the cells. Why don't
you give him this, and tell
him happy Christmas from me?
93:
HOUSE.
NIGHT.
The Ross residence looks like an ad for J&B.; Warm yellow light
from the windows. Holly wreath on the front door. The Mercedes
pulls up and BERLIN gets out with his bag and suit on a hanger.
A hard wind around the house. He walks inside without knocking.
95:
SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.
NIGHT.
This is probably a crane shot. A gale works up the valley. The
institute is in total darkness. Not a vehicle out front. Not a
sound except the marauding wind. Ross's Chevrolet is concealed
amongst trees. Been here long enough to allow slow flurries to
accumulate. It stares towards the building maybe 75 yards away.
104:
CHEVROLET.
INSTITUTE.
NIGHT.
Pines singing as the gale tears into them. Clutching his Winch-
ester ROSS opens the trunk. A dim light and a fluster of equip-
ment. BERLIN sorts out a pair of radios. Selects a channel and
ROSS whispers "What are you on?" ("local Tac.") Here come huge
12 cell flashlights and the intense whispers continue. "Local?"
ROSS
What if we need a back up?
BERLIN
We're not here. I don't
want the desk to hear us ..
O.K. it's channel 4 and copy? And they're already on their way.
106:
BACK OF BUILDING.
INSTITUTE.
NIGHT.
The storm bullies its way around the building. Lights approach
quickly. But one of them is already fading. It belongs to ROSS.
This fucker's got about 5 minutes in it. And whatever the plan
was it just got changed. BERLIN looks around in apprehension -
going in there alone ain't no joy - his flashlight ascends the
fire escape. And there it is 2 floors up. A half opened window.
BERLIN
Alright. I'll start at
the top, and work down.
ROSS
You ain't going in alone?
BERLIN
That's a liability, Ross. I
don't want you hanging on to
my shirt. Anyone but me comes
down these stairs, take em out
but try and keep him alive. I
want this bastard living ..
Takes off up the stairs. ROSS watches him vanish. (Waiting out
here ain't so tasty either.) The wind rages in nearby trees. A
door slams repeatedly somewhere a long way away. [Ross?] "10/2"
[I'm going in.] Big on ROSS and the radio. "You take care, Bro."
107:
REAR OF INSTITUTE.
NIGHT.
ROSS has moved into the shelter of a wall. Sleet passes almost
horizontally. His flashlight is over. The color of a tangerine.
ROSS [BERLIN]
[I'm on Helena's floor .. I'm
just gonna take a look at her
apartment .. You O.K.] Fucken
flashlight's kaput .. [Door's
locked .. shit] What's happen-
ing, Brother? [I can hear some-
thing? .. Something upstairs?]
110:
REAR OF INSTITUTE/FIRE ESCAPE.
NIGHT.
ROSS savaged by the gale. In considerable anxiety. Less than a
volt in his batteries. His failure to contact Berlin accelerat-
es his concern by the moment. Calls repeatedly "You hearing me?"
Big close on the radio. Fingers switch channels. Tries calling
on five/six. Still nothing and goes to channel eight. "Come in,
John?" Alright fuck it. Light or no light. He's going up there.
Still calling he barges at the wind making for the fire escape.
[You hear me? Just be care-
ful now, coz I'm coming up]
Stares up into the gloom of the iron stairs. Hardly got a foot
on the first before a Figure rushes down. Dressed in black and
very breathless. A powerful flashlight floods on dazzling ROSS.
Is that you, John? .. Ans-
wer. NOW .. Or I blow this
fucken staircase to pieces.
BERLIN [?]
Me, Freddy.
Thank Jesus the anxiety's over. The 12 gauge drops to his side.
ROSS
What the hell's going on up there,
Brother? I been calling 10 minutes.
The light remains steady and blinding and straight in his face.
Hey, c'mon, John .. Talk to me ...
Just the sound of breathlessness. Plus a .25 Walther automatic.
Jesus Christ .. What are you doing?
It glints at the peripheries of his vision and ROSS is alarmed.
What the fuck are you doing? - It's
me - Holy shit! - John - John - Not
you - Don't shoot you crazy bastard!
Two deathly flashes in quick succession. The first practically
taken Ross's hand off. The second slams into his guts and he's
down. The Glaser is unequalled in ferocity by any other bullet.
113:
FIRE ESCAPE (ATTIC LEVEL).
INSTITUTE.
NIGHT.
The MYOPIC JANITOR looks down. Five floors below a man lays on
his back. His shotgun discharges uselessly into trees. Another
man leans over him. Illuminates his agonized face with a flash-
light. Shoots him again point-blank in the upper body. The MYO-
PIC isn't staying for more. Hurries back along the fire escape.
114:
REAR OF INSTITUTE.
FIRE ESCAPE.
NIGHT.
Close on a bulb in a flashlight. The merest glimmer of energy.
Barely the light to see the blood. It seeps into a long-frozen
footprint in the ice. Fills it fast and expands over the sides.
Somebody say this can't be happening? BERLIN crumples to knees
in the snow. Dumps his light gasping for breath. Oblique light
creating desperate silhouettes. BERLIN howls like a dog. Howls
into his radio. "Nine - Nine - Nine." Blood all over his hands.
"This is a Nine - Nine - Nine - officer down." ROSS is heaving
like an old bull elephant. On the verge of unconsciousness. He
tries to speak. Got hit in the throat. BERLIN fights off tears.
"Don't talk old man." Repeats the emergency code but this time
he can't be heard. Almost imperceptibly a Carol filters in (In
The Bleak Mid Winter) and the Camera moves slowly away. BERLIN
cradles ROSS's tragic head and the song drowns the raging wind.
This beautiful Christmas carol will articulate rhythm of these
cuts. And there will be no other sound until the sequence ends.
116:
CITY STREET.
CITY HOSPITAL.
NIGHT.
A blue emergency light. Revolving in slow motion. Like a dream.
The city streets are a blur. The light accelerates into sudden
reality. Ambulance plus police convoy speed to a city hospital.
117:
LANDSCAPE.
BERLIN'S HOUSE.
DAWN.
A little house in winter meadows. Kind of pretty now it's pain-
ted. Just the first tint of pink on its roof. The Carol dissol-
ves into birdsong. Here comes the sun for a fine Christmas day.
120:
VERANDA.
HOUSE.
DAWN.
All new paint and all new things in expectation of happy times.
A barbecue still in polythene wraps. Price tag and unconnected
gas pipe shift gently in the breeze. A brand now swinging seat.
BERLIN sits in it with shock wearing on. Expressionless of sor-
row. Though he suffers every sorrow and guilt and regret there
is. Sunlight reaches the veranda and colors the end of it red.
silent and motionless he watches the lousiest dawn of his life.
121:
THE ROSS RESIDENCE.
LIVING ROOM.
DAY.
Lights glow on the Christmas tree. Unopened presents still und-
erneath. SERATO sits smoking in silence. Listens to a sound of
plates getting stacked in another room. He looks up but not in
surprise. He just wasn't aware BERLIN had arrived in the house.
BERLIN
Where's Margie?
Stunned and stubbled and full of grief. And that's just SERATO.
SERATO
Taken Bobby to her sister's ..
This atmosphere is unbearable and even these whispers seem laud.
They were going there anyway.
BERLIN
Does he know?
SERATO shakes his head. Loses his cigarette. And SAMMY appears.
SERATO
Thinks his dad's in hospital.
SAMMY SERATO is 30 and pretty. She continues collecting plates.
Why'd you go up there, John?
Knows he's not going to get a reply and doesn't bother to wait
for it. HELENA materializes from the den like a shadow. Sallow
for want of sleep and glad to have BERLIN's hand to hang on to.
BERLIN
I want you to go to your Aunt's.
A suggestion that surprises HELENA. And clearly doesn't appeal.
HELENA
Why can't I stay with you?
BERLIN
It's not possible right now.
HELENA
Why?
BERLIN
Please don't ask no quest-
ions now .. Not right now ..
If silence can intensify it's now. Sound of the front door and
then footsteps. BERLIN freezes as MARGIE appears. Wracked with
grief. Dead sickness of tears. Like she cried bones out of her
face. But no weeping now. Maybe shock. Maybe brave. Maybe both.
HELENA
Is that Margie?
MARGIE
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
The strongest face in the house. And now HELENA is in her arms.
Don't cry darlin .. he was a big
old cop and he didn't like tears ..
Dead echos of plates in the kitchen. And song of birds outside.
Feels like every second in my life,
was just the moment leading to this.
BERLIN
Margie ..
MARGIE
Don't.
Raises her hand to silence him and this is silence Margie owns.
Don't.
Christ this is just awful. HELENA crying and BERLIN on the way.
What's gonna happen now, John?
BERLIN
She has an aunt, in Vermont.
I'll take her there tonight.
HELENA
I'm going back to the institute.
BERLIN
No .. not now ..
MARGIE
Helena can stay here if she'd like
to .. I'd like her to .. I'll look
after her .. and she can look after
me .. I'm tired now .. I must sleep ..
Footsteps again as she walks out and silence again like before.
122:
FRONT YARD.
HOUSE.
NIGHT.
The Mercedes descends onto a low-loader courtesy of a car lift-
ing truck. BERLIN out of his door. Almost too ruined to apprec-
iate what's happening. Crane lights and flashlights and chains
getting tightened. Couple of Strangers and a Kid he recognizes.
BERLIN
What are you doing, Travis?
TRAVIS
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
BERLIN
Why?
TRAVIS
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
Flashes his light at a standard issue (brown) police Chevrolet.
I'm sorry, Sergeant. I did knock a
couple times. Didn't get any reply.
BERLIN
You got a warrant for this?
TRAVIS
Yes, Sir.
BERLIN
Who sought the warrant?
TRAVIS
The man from the F.B.I.
124:
TRACK/FRONT YARD.
BERLIN'S HOUSE.
DAY.
A yellow cab splashes through puddles and pulls up in front of
the house. HELENA gets out and pays. No she doesn't need assis-
tance. Picks up her suitcase and the cab vanishes into drizzle.
135:
CAR PARK.
POLICE STATION.
CITY OF EUREKA.
DAY.
Fog and dusk in that order. Headlights descend the slope. Park
and CITRINE plus cane get out. As he crosses the lot a Uniform
fires up a Harley. Next face is SERATO heading for his car. He
accosts the Chief with a piece of paper. It is read with escal-
ating incredulity. This would be comic if it wasn't so serious.
SERATO
She's in love with him,
Chief, and try anything?
CITRINE
Are you going up there?
SERATO
No, I just sent Travis.
I've got a call to make.
CITRINE
What about the man? .. Has he
seen this? .. [No he hasn't] ..
Alright, make your call, and
get up there ... Bullshit or
not, I wanna proper statement ..
141:
FRONT YARD.
BERLIN'S HOUSE.
DUSK.
A single light in a downstairs room. The house is stifled with
fog. A brown police Chevy parked out front. Here comes another
to join it. As BERLIN gets out SERATO appears on the porch. He
descends stairs with the impartial expression of a working cop.
BERLIN
I need a friend, Angelo.
SERATO keeps it dispassionate. Ignores BERLIN's desperate eyes.
SERATO
You got one.
Puts a thumb towards the house and already heading for his oar.
She's a bad witness, John.
But a fucking lousy alibi.
143:
HILLSIDE.
OAKLAND.
DAY.
Wide over the bay area. Wind swept and rain swept. City lights
beginning to come on. In the distance the docks and far beyond
the ocean. Somewhere here is a solitary phone booth. "I'm look-
ing for a special type of rattan .. friend of mine recommended
you, said I should ask for someone called Amanda .. You don't?
O.K. .. Thank you." Followed by sound of a phone slamming down.
154:
MARKET/WAREHOUSE.
CAR PARK.
DUSK.
Plenty of rain to hurry in. AMANDA. drives a red Datsun. She ex-
its the car park with a man in a brown Chevrolet following her.
157:
CAR/STREETS.
SUBURBS.
OAKLAND.
NIGHT.
The Chevy tails the Datsun through city streets. A lot of rush
hour traffic. Music to go with it and it's probably Mussorgsky.
A final cut and headlights are navigating the hills. Disappear
and reappear as they ascend. Steep inclines and the houses are
middle class. Too dark to see much now but lamp posts and rain.
Still climbing the Datsun takes a side street. BERLIN keeps 50
yards behind. She turns off and parks in a sloping driveway. A
white Volkswagen van at the top of it. BERLIN has already pull-
ed over. Kills his lights and watches her hurry into the house.
158:
STEEP STAIRS.
PORCH.
HOUSE.
NIGHT.
BERLIN just rang the doorbell. Imposes an impartial expression.
But this is his last chance and he knows it. The front door is
opened & secured on a safety-chain. AMANDA carries a white Cat.
BERLIN
I'm sorry to trouble you, but eh ..
Wait a minute, don't I know you?
And she stares like he does not. Before she stares like he does.
You're Amanda? Remember, you near-
ly ran into me? Way up in Trinity?
His smile disarms the securities. And she opens the front door.
AMANDA
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly
ran into me? What's the problem?
BERLIN
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
AMANDA
The van?
BERLIN
Is it your vehicle?
AMANDA
No, my mother's .. You better stop
in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
159:
DRIVE.
THE ROSS RESIDENCE.
DAY.
Gale still making a mass of the trees. A police Chevy pulls up
and TAYLOR gets out. Puts a knuckle on the window of a black &
white. A Uniform wakes and TAYLOR interrupts his apologies "Go."
And the young Cop does the drive as TAYLOR heads for the house.
170:
THE ROSS RESIDENCE.
DUSK.
Music on the cut and this is a crane shot high above the house.
A car tears up the drive with the Camera descending to meet it.
BERLIN out and into the house. And still the gale howls around.
173:
FREEWAY INTERSECTION.
NIGHT.
Wide over an intersection. Berlin's Chevy crosses a bridge and
descends into lights. Music travels with him but the Camera re-
mains static. Watches tail lights dissolve into a river of red.
175:
FREEWAY.
NIGHT.
Tracking back with the car. As yet 100 yards away. Moving fast
and getting closer. As it approaches a remote sound of a phone
drifts in. And headlights so near now they wipe out everything.
176:
PHONE BOOTH.
GAS STATION.
NIGHT.
This is a little country stop some place an the peripheries of
the snow-line. BERLIN slams the phone down and runs to his car.
Screeches out onto the highway and the Camera begins to ascend.
The Camera climbs higher revealing somber mountains. Plus mile
upon mile of road he has yet to travel. Still it ascends until
the Chevrolet is reduced to an insignificance by the landscape.
180:
SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.
NIGHT.
A panoramic over the institute wide enough to include surround-
ing forest. Headlights approach down a wooded track and go out.
Just possible to see a tiny Figure moving towards the building.
181:
FIRE ESCAPE.
INSTITUTE.
NIGHT.
High on the fire escape looking down. A flashlight arrives bel-
ow. Eerie fragmentation of light as the Figure begins to climb.
SHASTA VALLEY.
NIGHT.
The highway is winding and narrowed with snow. Couldn't find a
lousier road on which to overtake. BERLIN is right up behind a
forty ton truck and he's trying to overtake. Hits the horn and
tries again. Halfway past the trailer when a bend suddenly rel-
eases headlights. An angry claxon and he's forced to pull back.
183:
FIRE ESCAPE.
INSTITUTE.
NIGHT.
Close-up sound and close-up picture. A glass-cutter scores the
window. A nasty noise but you'd have to be wide awake and list-
ening to hear it. A gloved fist punches the section out. Falls
to the floor and shatters. And a hand reaches in for the catch.
145:
