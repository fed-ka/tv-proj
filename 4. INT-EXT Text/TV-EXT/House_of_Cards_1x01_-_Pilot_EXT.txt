      SLOWLY PULL IN on the front door of a fashionable DC 
      townhouse.  

      Off-screen, we hear the SOUND OF SCREECHING TIRES followed by 
      a LOUD COLLISION.  A CAR ALARM blares. 

      After a moment, the door to the townhouse opens and A MAN 
      emerges, curious to see what the commotion is outside. 

      As the Man comes into the light we see he s dressed in a 
      crisp TUXEDO with the collar unfastened, no tie.  This is 
      FRANCIS UNDERWOOD - Richard III, Iago and Hannibal Lecter all 
      rolled into one.  He has intelligent eyes, mischievous lips 
      and a deep baritone dripping with Southern charm.

      Francis glances down the street.  He see a CAR backing up 
      then PEELING AWAY from the parked car that it just hit.  It 
      disappears around the block.

      As Francis heads purposefully toward the scene of the 
      accident, we begin to hear a DOG WHIMPERING IN PAIN.  Francis 
      looks down at the ground.  Francis  security detail guy STEVE 
      (40s) appears beside him. 

                                    FRANCIS
                    Did you get a good look?

                                  STEVE
                    Blue Toyota Camry.  First two 
                    letters of the plate.

      Francis and Steve gaze down at the suffering animal.

                                    FRANCIS
                    The Warton s dog.  

                                  STEVE
                    Looks like a broken back.

                                    FRANCIS
                    It s not gonna make it.
                          (to Steve)
                    Go next door and see if they re 
                    home. 

      Steve heads towards the neighbors  townhouse.

      Francis kneels down beside the dog.  It s in awful shape.  He 
      tenderly strokes the dog s head.  

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Shhhh.  It s okay...                                                                                      2.


      Francis looks up at us.  The sound of CAR ALARM FADES.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the camera)
                    There are two kinds of pain.  Good 
                    pain - the sort of pain that 
                      motivates, that makes you strong.  
                    Then there s bad pain - useless 
                    pain, the sort of pain that s only 
                      suffering.  I welcome the former.  
                    I have no patience for the latter.

      With cool-headed deliberateness, Francis calmly places a hand 
      around the dog s neck and begins to put it out of its misery.  

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the camera)
                    Moments like this require someone 
                    like me.  Someone who will act.  
                    Who will do what no one else has 
                    the courage to do.  The unpleasant 
                    thing.  The necessary thing.

      The Dog s muffled whimpers cease. Francis looks down.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the dog)
                    There.  No more pain.

      He lets go. The sound of the CAR ALARM RISES again.

      Francis stands as Steve approaches. The shook-up neighbors, 
      JACK and BARBARA WARTON, follow several yards behind.   

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (aside, to Steve)
                    We need to leave in ten minutes.

                                  STEVE
                    Car s ready.

      Francis turns his attention to the couple. He gently 
      approaches them with endless sympathy in his eyes. 

                                    FRANCIS
                    It was a hit and run.

                                  JACK
                          (to his wife)
                    He must ve jumped over the gate 
                    again...

      Barbara wells up.  Francis lays a hand on her shoulder.                                                                                      3.


                                    FRANCIS
                    I m so sorry.  I ll have Steve file 
                    a report.  We ll track them down. 



      We re following Francis and Claire as everyone files out.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Claire...

      They re approached by another power couple: the longtime 
      Senator CHARLES HOLBURN and his socialite wife FELICITY, both 
        immaculately groomed, styled and outfitted. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hello Felicity.

      Holburn gravitates toward Claire, Holburn toward Francis.

                                    HOLBURN
                    Frank.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (shaking his head)
                    Morning Charles.

      We track Claire and Felicity, a few paces ahead of the men.                                                                                    25.


                                  FELICITY
                          (to Claire, 
                              sympathetically)
                    How are you?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Terrific. 

                                    FELCITY
                    I m sorry about the...you know.
                          (nods back toward Francis)

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, you mean the...

                                    FELCITY
                    Just awful.  Charles and I were so 
                    upset when we heard.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (smiling)
                    It s nothing.  Really.  Between you 
                    and me, I think Francis is 
                    relieved.  He feels much more at 
                    home in Congress.

      We JUMP OVER to Francis and Holburn.

                                    HOLBURN
                      I would ve bet a million dollars 
                    Walker was going to choose you.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (laughs it off)
                    Good thing you have a million 
                    dollars to spare.

                                    HOLBURN
                    But Kern - come on.  That s a real 
                    insult, isn t it?  He s got half 
                    the experience you do, and less 
                    than half the brain.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    He must ve had his reasons.  

                                    HOLBURN
                    This is bad for business.  We 
                    needed a strong-man in the State 
                      Department, not a straw man.

                                    FRANCIS
                    We ll make do.                                                                                    26.


                                    HOLBURN
                    You re a bigger man than me.  I d 
                    be pissed as hell.  

      Francis and Claire catch each other s eyes.  They appreciate 
      the sympathy of the Holburns, but they abhor sympathy as a 
      concept.  It feels humiliating.



      Franics stands outside, scrolling through his blackberry, 
      more to look like he s busy than because he is.                                                                                    29.


      A cab pulls up. Zoe emerges. She s in a strapless black dress 
      that hugs every curve. It isn t very fancy, but it sure gets 
      the job done.  

      It s cold.  She s not dressed for the weather.  Her 
      headlights are FULLY ON.  She turns to her date, BRIAN, early 
      30s - a typical Capitol Hill climber.  He s getting out of 
      the cab behind her.  

                                  ZOE
                    Gimme your jacket.

      He pulls off his jacket and hands it to her.  She drapes it 
      over the front of her dress and starts hurrying to main 
      doors.  She s not going to be late for this.

      As she climbs the steps Francis notices her - more out of 
      instinct than interest.  He glances at her ass ever so 
      briefly as she passes.  And it s an exceptional ass.  We can 
      tell from the form-fitting fabric that she s wearing a thong.

      Once Zoe has passed, Francis turns to his attention back to 
      the blackberry.



      TIGHT on a finger pushing the door bell.  A moment later the 
      door opens, revealing Francis. We CUT TO Zoe standing 
      opposite, Steve right beside her.

                                  STEVE
                    Sir, I m sorry to bother you.  This 
                    woman said you were expecting her.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Who are you?

                                  ZOE
                    My name is Zoe Barnes.  I m a 
                    reporter at the Washington Herald.

                                    FRANCIS
                    It s almost ten at night.  This is 
                    my home.  I don t -

                                  ZOE
                    We re part of a mutual appreciation 
                    club.

      She holds out her phone.  We can t see what s on it, but 
      Francis can.  He smiles.                                                                                    38.


                                    FRANCIS
                    You re a fan of the opera.

                                  ZOE
                    More for the people watching than 
                    the music.  Same as you.

      Francis is impressed by her brassiness. 

                                    FRANCIS 
                          (opens the door wider)
                    Come in, Ms. Barnes.



      A BMW slows to a halt by the curb with a POLICE CAR slowing 
      to a stop behind it, lights flashing.

      CUT TO: A POLICE OFFICER ambles up to the stopped BMW and 
      aims a flashlight at the driver. It s Russo. He looks wasted. 

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    License and registration.

                                  RUSSO
                    The glove compartment sweetheart.

      We see that there s a CALL-GIRL in the passenger seat.  She 
      gets the registration out of the glove compartment while 
      Russo pulls out his license and hands it to the cop.

                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    Here you go. 

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    This isn t your license.  It s a 
                    Starbucks card.

                                  RUSSO
                      Oh...sorry about that.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Sir - have you been drinking?

                                  RUSSO
                    No, I don t drink coffee at this 
                    hour.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                          (not amused)
                    I m going to need you to step out 
                    of the car.

                                  RUSSO
                    If I was speeding just write me a 
                    ticket and I ll -

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Sir, out of the car.  Right now.                                                                                    44.


                                  RUSSO
                    Alright listen, I don t want to 
                    sound like a prick, but I m a 
                    member of Congress...

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    I don t care if you re the King of 
                    China.

                                  RUSSO
                    China doesn t have a King.  It s a 
                    communist oligwock - ola - 
                    communist oligarchy.  Man, that s 
                    hard to say.

      The cop opens the door.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Let s go.  Out.
                          (to the Call-Girl)
                    You too.



      A WIDE PAN of massive crowds gathered for the Inauguration 
      Ceremony on a crystal clear, January morning. 

                                  FRANCIS (V.O.)
                    Power is like real estate.  It s 
                    all about location, location, 
                    location.

    CUT TO the rostrum on the Capitol steps.  Walker has his hand 
      raised as CHIEF JUSTICE conducts the oath of office.  

                                  FRANCIS (V.O.)
                    The closer you are to the source, 
                    the higher your property value.                                                                                    61.


      We ZOOM IN on Francis and Claire sitting in the first row 
      behind the lectern.

                                    FRANCIS (V.O.)
                    A hundred years from now, when 
                    people watch this footage, who will 
                    they see smiling just at the edge 
                    of the frame?

      Francis gives a little wave to the camera.

                                  CHIEF JUSTICE
                    So help you God.

                                  WALKER
                    So help me God.



      TIGHT on Walker in the midst of his Inaugural Address.

                                  WALKER
                    ...Today is not simply about the 
                    next four years.  It s about the 
                    next four decades.  You ve placed 
                    your faith in me, and I, in turn, 
                    choose to place that faith in our 
                    children.  Our children are the key 
                    to this nation s future, and that s 
                    why the first order of business for 
                    this administration will be a 
                      comprehensive Education Reform Bill 
                    to properly fix, finance and 
                      strengthen our nation s schools.   

      Huge cheers from the audience.  QUICK CUT TO Francis, 
      clapping vigorously, staring right at us.



      The streets are empty.  Sanitation workers sweep up the 
      ticker tape from the previous day s celebration.  Police 
      crews load barricades into flatbed trucks.



      It s a bitterly cold, bright sunny day.  Francis arrives at 
      the restaurant with a newspaper tucked under his arm.  FREDDY 
      - the husky African American proprietor - sees him 
      approaching and opens the door for him.

                                  FREDDY
                    Mornin  Frank.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Morning Freddy.  How are you?

                                  FREDDY
                    Can t kick.  Come on in.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Actually, would you mind setting up 
                    a table for me outside?

                                  FREDDY
                    Outside?  It s freezing.                                                                                    64.


                                    FRANCIS
                    I ll be fine.  A little cold never 
                    hurt anyone.

      Freddy nods and heads inside.  Francis turns to the camera.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    My one guilty pleasure is a good 
                    racks of ribs.  Even at 7:30 in the 
                    morning. I have the whole place to 
                    myself.  Freddy opens up just for 
                    me...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Francis at a table, breath condensing in the cold air.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Where I grew up in South Carolina 
                    nobody had two pennies to rub 
                    together.  A rack of ribs was a 
                    luxury, like Christmas in July.  
                    I ve had a weakness for them ever 
                    since. 

      Freddy comes outside with a steaming plate of ribs.  Places 
      them before Francis.  Before digging in, Francis glances at 
      the newspaper he brought with him.

      Zoe s breaking story, detailing the contents of the leaked 
      Education Bill, occupies a huge swath of the front page.  The 
      headline reads:

                          EDUCATION BILL FAR LEFT OF CENTER

      We PAN DOWN to see Zoe s byline in bold above the article.

      QUICK MONTAGE

      -- Blythe in his office staring at the article on his 
      computer.  Complete horror.

      -- Vasquez in the back of an SUV scrolling through her 
      blackberry in even more horror.

      -- Zoe, Lucas and Hammerschmidt gathered around a computer 
      where a TECH GUY is monitoring a graph.

                                  TECH GUY
                    The web traffic is crazy.

      -- Janine watching Zoe, Hammer and Lucas from a distance, 
      eyes narrowed - jealous.                                                                                    65.


      -- A COP CAR with its lights flashing beside a dented BLUE 
      TOYOTA CAMRY - the same car that hit the dog in the opening 
      scene.  Two COPS cuffing the mangy 20 year-old CULPRIT.  



      Francis  plate is empty.  He wipes his hands and dabs his 
      mouth with a napkin.  Freddy starts to clear Francis s plate.

                                  FREDDY
                    You want seconds?

                                    FRANCIS
                    I better not.  

      Freddy starts off.  Scarcely a moment later...

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Actually, yes.  I m feeling hungry 
                    today.

      Freddy goes inside. Francis stares right at us, piercingly.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the camera)
                    There are two kinds of pain, but 
                    only one kind of pleasure - total, 
                      unstoppable, undeniable victory.
                          (leans toward us)
                    The minister was wrong about 
                    defeat. I wasn t put on this planet 
                    to endure.  I was put on this 
                    planet to win.   

      He closes his eyes again and leans back.  Basks in the sun 
      and exhales a long, deep breath into the cold air. 

      The serenity is shattered by sudden, thumping ROCK MUSIC.

      Black out.

                                            THE END
