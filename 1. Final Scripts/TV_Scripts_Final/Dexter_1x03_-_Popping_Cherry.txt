    His face kind of scrunched into a look of compassion.  Start

                        You d never know I was a sociopath.  
                      I m quite well versed in human 
                        behavior, and when I apply myself, 
                        nobody can tell I m faking it -- 
                        except at funerals.

    We can now see that Dexter stands among a group of MOURNERS, 
    half of them in tears or weeping.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      I m not good at grief.  In those

    EXT. BEACH- DAY1

    By the turquoise water s edge, sixMiami Police HONOR GUARD 
    stand at attention on either side of a lectern, surrounded 
    by flower arrangements.  Sixtyfolding chairs are filled, 
    many of them byuniformed MEN and WOMEN in law enforcement. 
    Dexter stands among a group of mourners behind the chairs.

    At the lectern, Detective STEVE McNAMARA, 40s, brave and 
    dignified but torn up inside, talks into a microphone.

                        wouldn t want any of you hitting on my

    AFTER THE SERVICE22

    Knee-deep in water, TWO ELDERLY COUPLES, the parents of the 
    deceased, spread their children s ashes in the ocean.  By 
    the shore, bereaved officers, friends, and family members 
    congregate and commiserateas they watch.  Doakes approaches 
    McNamara, who stands with two rough-and-tumble COP FRIENDS.

                        It s a fucking travesty.

                        Heard you re going after Guerrero.

                        Shit yeah.  This ain t over.  Guerrero 
                        ordered these hits.  I m gonna make 
                        something stick to that cartel cock-
                        sucker.

                        I never knew you and Rickywere so 
                        tight.

    Doakes, who was actually sleeping with Ricky swife, covers.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Ain t about that.  Fuckwith a cop,

                      we protect, am I right?

    As the cop friends enthusiastically ad lib their agreement, 
    SWING AROUND to find Lt. LaGuertaa short distance away, 
    giving sound bites to a TV NEWS CREW.

                        We re heartbroken over the tragic loss 
                      of our fallen brother.  But we praise 
                      his courage.  RickySimmonsknew no 
                        fear.  I always called him the 
                        gutsiest man on the police force. 

    Debra WIPES PAST, staring in disgust.  FOLLOW her to Dexter.

                      Can you believe that cow?  She didn t 
                        even know Simmons.

                                        DEXTER
                      At least she knew he was a cop... 
                        unless, wait -- did you tell her?

    Debra smiles.

                                        DEBRA
                      I m proud of you for coming, Bro.  I 
                        know you hate funerals.  How you

                      I m managing.

    Debra gives his arm a sympathy squeeze then splits off. 
    Dexter turns to look out to sea, where the two elderly 
    couples are returning from spreading ashes.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      No I m not.  Keeping one s face 
                        pinched in sorrow for two hours 
                        straight is a real chore.

    Dexter s attention drifts to a CHILD using a red plastic 
    shovel to build castles in the sand.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Ooh, that reminds me.  I need to pick 
                      up a shovel for my next project.

    EXT. CORRECTIONS FACILITY - DAY 133

    A batch of hardcore YOUNG MEN -- all races, sizes, and gang 
    affiliations, but none older than 21 -- are escorted by a 
    PRISON GUARD out the front gates of a low-slung, concrete 
    facility surrounded by high chain-link.  Excited families, 
    gangsters, and hoodrats greet them.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Florida prisons kick free 25,000 
                        inmates a year.  They don t do that 
                      for me, but it sure feels like it.

    INT. DEXTER S CAR - DAY 144

    CLOSE ON a gleaming RED SHOVEL, price tag and stickers still 
    attached, propped up in the passenger seat.  PAN to Dexter, 
    parked out front, watching the young men being released.

                        I search for ones who think they beat 
                      the system.  They re not hard to find.  
                        Like young Jeremy Downs.

    Dexter sees JEREMY, 19, hardened beyond his years.  He steps 
    through the gate, squinting into the sunlight.  The guard 
    escorts Jeremy, who has no one to greet him, into a van that 
    says  Homestead Halfway House. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Today, Jeremy is just another piece of 
                        trash on the street.  But four years 
                        ago, he was the toast of Miami...

    A SCREEN55

    An Asian REPORTER stands in a park, holding a microphone.  A 
    GRAPHIC reads:  BREAKING NEWS.  SANDRAYEE.  MIAMI.   Police 
    cars can be seen behind her, along with yellow police tape 
    stretched out to keep a gathering CROWD out of the park.

                      It was a gruesome scene today.  The

    INT. DEXTER S APARTMENT - NIGHT 1

    Dexter sits shirtless behind his desk on a hot Miami night, 
    eating popcornand watching the archived NEWS REPORT on his 
    computer.  A gentle breeze billows the curtains behind him.

                        Police haven t released the name of 
                      the victim, but our sources tell us 
                        that investigators are holding a 15-
                        year-old suspect in custody.  

    On the computer, B-ROLL NEWS FOOTAGE shows uniform officers 
    wheeling out a BODY covered by a white sheet, followed by 
    fuzzy LONG-LENS SHOTS of police poking aroundthe area.

                        We re hearing that the suspect lured 
                      the older boy to the pond to spot 
                        alligators.  But once they were alone, 
                      the victim was robbed and repeatedly 
                        stabbed.

    Using the mouse, Dexter closes the window on-screen with the 
    news report and clicks on a folder with AUTOPSY PHOTOS.  He 
    starts flipping through COLOR STILLS of the dirty, bloody 
    body of a HEAVYSET BOY, 17, crisscrossed with deep knife 
    wounds.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                      To the coroner, the knife strokes 
                        looked random, impulsive.  But I saw 
                      the work of a young virtuoso.  Too 
                        many major arteries were severed...  
                        femoral, brachial, carotid.

    Dexter, staring with wide eyes, takes a bite of popcorn.  He 
    clicks the mouse and a PHOTO OF JEREMY in the courtroom 
    appears.  The boy has a smug smile on his face.

                        Jeremy got off easy.  Four years in a 
                        juvenile facility for manslaughter.  
                      But I knew what he was, and what he d 
                      do again.  All I had to do was circle 
                      my calendar... and wait.

    PUSH INTO the bulletin board near the desk, where on the 
    calendar a DATE IS CIRCLED that says:  Jeremy.

    EXT. RITA S HOUSE - YARD - DAY 266

    From a LOW ANGLE in the dirt, the new RED SHOVEL swiftly 
    STRIKES down on us.  Dexter, wearing jeans and a t-shirt, 
    wields the shovel.  He uses the sharp edge to hack at 
    something we can t see.  We can only imagine what, until --

    THE LUMINOUS RITA

    Strolls up in a skirt with a tray of ice-cold lemonade.

    REVEAL that Dexter is digging up a dead little LEMON TREE in 
    front of her modest home.  Nearby, CODY and ASTOR play in 
    the dirt with hand shovels.  Dexter turns to the kids.

                        Paul doesn t live here anymore.

                                        FRANKIE
                      No shit, he s in jail.  But he still 
                        owes me for fiftygrams of blow, which 
                        means youowe me.

    As Dexter curiously steps over, Rita holds up a hand.

                                        RITA
                        Don t get involved.

                      I m supposed to get involved?  I never 
                        know in these situations.

    Rita, scared, turns to Frankie.

                                        RITA
                        I don t have money.

    Frankie indicates the Toyota RAV4 parked in the driveway.

                                        FRANKIE
                      You have a car.

                                        RITA
                                (disbelief)
                      My car...?

                                        FRANKIE
                                (snaps fingers)
                        Keys.

    Rita doesn t know what to do.  Cody innocently looks up.

                                        CODY
                      You know my dad?

    Frankie squats down to Cody s level and smiles.

                                        FRANKIE
                      Why I sure do, little man.  And you 
                        look just like him.  I ll tell him you 
                        said hi, okay?

    Frankie reaches to tousle Cody s hair, but Rita pulls her 
    son close, out of Frankie s reach.  With a knowing smile, 
    Frankie rises to his feet and gets serious.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Look... you want I could go into your 
                        house and throw around your furniture, 
                        make a real mess.  But what kind of 
                        message would that send to the little 
                        ones?  Just give me your fucking car.

    Dexter knows better than to challenge this guy with the kids 
    around.  He calmly turns to Rita, who s near tears.

                                        DEXTER
                        Maybe you should go get the keys.  
                        I ll wait here with our friend.

    Rita nods and herds the children inside.  Frankie turns and 
    stares daggers at Dexter, an imposing figure,holding the 
    shovel in his hands.

                                        FRANKIE
                        What?  Think you can take me?

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      In my sleep.

    Off Dexter s innocent expression --

    MOMENTS LATER

    Frankie recklessly backs down the driveway in the RAV4, 
    bounces over a curb and speeds away.  Dexter watches him go.

    INT. RITA S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 277

    Rita sits on the toilet peeing and crying.  She reaches into 
    a vanity drawer mirror for a rubber band, pulls it onto her 
    wrist, and starts snapping it.  She hears a KNOCK.

                                                                            INTERCUT:

    INT. RITA S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 2 (CONTINUOUS)88

    Dexter stands outside the bathroom door.

                        Yes.

    Dexter really wants to help but isn t exactly sure how.

                                        DEXTER
                      Do you need toilet paper?

                                        RITA
                      No.

                        He s gone.

    Rita dries her eyes, flushes the chain, and adjusts her 
    skirt.  She opens the door to find Dexter standing there.

                                        DEXTER
                      Guy clearly had no idea who he was 
                        dealing with.  I ll file a report at

    Rita subconsciously pulls her sleeve over the rubber band.

                                        RITA
                      No, Dexter -- thanks.  No reports.  
                        Paul s out of our lives, I ve filed 
                      for divorce... I just want my past to

                                        DEXTER
                        Okay, well -- I can give you a ride to 
                        work until you get another car.

    Rita slips her arm through Dexter s and heads outside.

                                        RITA
                      Or, I can take the bus like millions 
                      of other people.  Now c mon, let s go 
                        outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

    Off Rita forcing an impossibly hopeful smile --

    INT. POLICE STATION - DEXTER S LAB - DAY 2 (MORNING)99

    CLOSE on a BLOOD SPATTER PHOTO that shows a vertical arc of 
    crimson blood stretching up a wall.  Dexter and ANGEL 
    BATISTA discuss the photo, pinned on a bulletin board. 

                                        DEXTER
                        That s not arterial spurting.  The 
                        drops are elliptical in shape.They 
                        were cast off by a weapon, something 
                      the killer swung overhead.

                                        BATISTA

                      in on the left side?

    As Dexter shows Batista a CRIME SCENE PHOTO, VINCE MASUKA 
    enters the work area.

                                        MASUKA

                        Yeah, but how great to pull a Bronco 
                      on that one, yeah?  Yeah?

    Dexter just stares at them blankly.  Batista explains --

                                        BATISTA
                        Mira aqu .  You do her doggy style, 
                        right?  Just when she gets into it, 
                      you grab her hips and yell another 
                        woman s name.  Bam, you re riding a 
                        bronco  cause she s trying to buck you 
                        off.

    Masuka, getting into the spirit of things, lets out a holler 
    and pretends to ride.  Dexter can only stare in amazement.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Many times in life, I feel like I m 
                        missing some essential piece of the 
                        human puzzle.  This is one of them.

    Debra runs up, looking for Dexter, and sees Masuka.

                                        DEBRA
                        What re you doing -- the Bronco?

    Debra excitedly turns to Dexter.

                        Christmas morning.

    INT. HOCKEY ARENA - DAY 2 (MORNING)1212

    Dexter enters the expansive space, which looks even bigger 
    with the uniform rows of empty seats.  SOUNDS of an active 
    murder scene echo across the cold, hard surfaces.  Dexter 
    stops at the perimeter of the ice rink and peers through the 
    plexiglass with child-like wonder.

    REVERSE ANGLE

    Reveals a woman s bloodless BODY PARTS, carefully wrapped in 
    butcher paper and stacked on ice inside the goalie net.  The 
    brunette HEAD of the victim is perched ghoulishly atop the 
    pile.  Crime scene PERSONNEL work the area.

                        right setting is essential, but this -- 
                        it s stunning.

    AT THE HOCKEY NET

    Batista and Masuka are already examining the body.  Dexter, 
    struggling not to slip, crosses the ice and joins them.

                                        DEXTER

    Masuka laughs.  Dexter nods --  You got me  -- then turns to 
    stare at the body, mesmerized.

                                (realizing)
                        He s escalating the thrill.  Posing 
                      his victim in a 20,000-seat stadium 
                      for all Miami to see.  To show them, 
                        show us, what he s capable of doing.

    Debra eagerly slips and slides her way across the ice to 
    join them and skids into Dexter, who catches her.

                                        DEBRA
                        What dI miss?  What dI miss?

                        Relax.  You re not missing anything.

    Masuka smiles and waves a SEVERED HAND at Debra.  The 
    FINGERTIPS have been sliced off.

                                        MASUKA
                      But sheis... fingertips.

                        Fucking A!  That s my girl!
                                (toDexter)
                        This body belongs to the fingertips we 
                        found frozen in the ice truck.  Shari 
                        Taylor.  Another prostitute.

    Dexter smiles proudly at his sister.

                                        DEXTER
                        Well, no blood, no need for me.  I 
                        should probably get going.

    Doakes strides over, managing much better than Deb and Dex 
    did on the slick ice.  He glowers at Dexter.

                                        SGT. DOAKES

    Doakes walks away.  Intrigued, Dexter turns to Debra.

                                        DEXTER
                        There s really a suspect?

                        back from my first official homicide 
                        investigation.  Damn, it s good to be 
                      out of vice.  I can t wait to...

    Her voice trails off when Masuka stands, WIPING FRAME to 
    reveal the SEVERED HEAD of the victim.  Debra blanches.

                                        DEBRA
                        I knowher.

                      She called herself Cherry.  We worked 
                      the same corner when I was undercover.  
                      We had coffee together.  She always 
                        ordered hers black.  Like her pimp.
                                (knowingit s lame)
                      She thought that was funny.

                                        DEXTER
                      So you and Cherry were, like, friends?

                                        DEBRA
                        I guess.

    Debra appears shaken, maybe even close to tears.  Dexter has 
    compassion for his sister, but as a semi-sociopath he never 
    knows how to show it.

                                        DEXTER
                                (sincere)

                              (as if)
                        Fuckoff.

    Upset, she turns to go, slips a little, rights herself and 
    walks away.

    INT. HOCKEY ARENA - THE STANDS - DAY 2 (MORNING)1313

    LaGuerta has set up a command post halfway up the stands, 
    with a dramatic view of the ice below.  Doakes briefs her.

                        Someone had to be here last night who 
                      saw something.  A rent-a-badge?  A

                        men s room?  Work with me.

                        It s possible the watchman was in the

                      No.  I want you to stay with Doakes.

    LaGuerta turns to go.  Debra can t believe it.  Doakes is 
    caught in between, but he s a detective first and foremost.

    glares at Debra.

                        Don t come back without information.

    LaGuertaturns and walks away.  Debra gives a small nod of 
    appreciation to Doakes, who nods back.

    EXT. CALLE OCHO - STOREFRONTS - DAY 21414

    A row of colorful storefronts -- all the flavors of Miami.  
    Dexter stands outside a curio shop with a table out front, 
    full of assorted second-hand knickknacks.  Dexter holds up a 
    blown-glass POODLE to examine it.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Everyone moves to Miami to die, which 
                        means we have more junk than any city 
                      in America.  A skilled bargain hunter 
                      can find real treasure here -- Tiffany 
                        lamps, Steuben glass -- but that s not 
                      my idea of hunting.

    RACK FOCUS from Dexter s POVof the poodle to REVEAL Jeremy, 
    walking up the sidewalk toward Dexter, window shopping.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     17.

                        I prefer a stalk and ambush approach.  
                      My instincts are impeccable, but I 
                        have to be sure of my prey.

    Dexter curiously watches Jeremy stop to survey the wares of 
    a KNIFE VENDOR, 60s, a bit of a yahoo wearing an American 
    Eagle cap and surrounded by American flags.  He has set out 
    a couple card tables with rows of shining KNIVES, all sizes 
    and shapes, floating on dark velvet.

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                        What chain the market for?  You hunt 
                        trophies or meat?

                                        JEREMY
                        Excuse me?

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                        Well, trophy hunters, they re into the 
                      raw adrenaline rush...
                                  (redneckaccent)
                        Kill it till it dies, Billy Bob!
                                (then)
                        Meat hunters are looking for dinner.  
                        What reyou looking for?

                                        JEREMY
                      Can I see that one?

    Jeremy points to a SKINNING KNIFE with a 4-inch blade, not 
    the most impressive of the lot.  The vendor takes the knife 
    and deftly shows it off like a birthday party magician. 

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                        Good eye.  Fixed-blade skinning knife.  
                        Full-tang stainless steel.  Real time 
                        saver for hunters who like to do their 
                      own butchering in the field.

    Dexter drifts a little closer, as the knife vendor holds up 
    the skinning knife, which glints in the sunlight.

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                      See the way that blade curves gently, 
                        son?  Like an eagle s talon.  It s 
                        yours for fifteen dollars.

                                        JEREMY
                                (pulls out a twenty)
                        I ll take it.

                        wouldn t you?  I ll get your change.

    Jeremy delicately picks up the knife off the table to test 
    the weight, holding the handle with an expert backhand grip.  
    Abruptly, he SLASHES the empty air in front of him, once, 
    twice, then spins with the blade --

    -- and a HAND catches his wrist, stopping him in midswing.  
    The hand belongs to Dexter, now standing next to Jeremy.  
    The knife hovers two inches from Dexter s head.  CLOSE on 
    Jeremy s eyes -- cold, enraged, hungry.

    Dexter stares at Jeremy with an odd sense of recognition.

                                        DEXTER
                        Easy, kid.

    The knife vendor turns to see Dexter holding off the knife.

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                      Hey -- what the Sam Hill?

    Jeremy pulls his hand away.

                                        JEREMY
                        I didn t see him.

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                              (to Dexter)
                      You okay, sir?

                                        DEXTER
                      I m fine.  Honest mistake.  No harm.

    The knife vendor hands Jeremy his change.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     19.

                      Be more careful, huh?

    Jeremy takes off up the street, looking nervously over his 
    shoulder at Dexter.  The knife vendor turns to Dexter.

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                        Sorry about that.  I only sell  em.  
                      So what reyou hunting?  Trophies or 
                        meat?

    Off Dexter, watching Jeremy go --

                                                                            FLASHBACK:

    EXT. WOODS - DAY1717

    CLOSE on HARRY, dressed for a hike, walking through thick 
    woods with 15-year-old TEENAGEDEXTER.  They move in and out 
    of shadows as they talk.

                                        TEENAGEDEXTER
                      You ever shoot anybody, Dad?

                                        HARRY
                        Afraid so.

                                        TEENAGEDEXTER
                      Any of  em die?

                                        HARRY
                        Just one.

                                        TEENAGEDEXTER
                        How d it feel?  To kill a guy?

    Harry turns and fixes his son with a probing look.

                                        HARRY
                      Not so great, Dex.  When you take a 
                        man s life, you re not just killing 
                        him.  You re snuffing out all the 
                        things he ll ever become.

    That reality hits Teenage Dexter.

                                        HARRY
                      As a police officer, I only fire my 
                        weapon to save a life.  That s a code 
                        I live by.  Killing has to serve a 
                        purpose.  Otherwise, it s just plain 
                        murder.

    Harry sees something on the ground ahead.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     20.

                        There it is...

    They reach a FALLEN DEER, bleeding in the hindquarters from 
    where it was shot, but still breathing.  For the first time, 
    we notice the RIFLE in Harry s hands.Teenage Dexter stares 
    down.

                                        TEENAGE DEXTER
                        It s still alive.

    Harry, troubled by his son s questions, has an idea to help 
    the boy cope with his emerging instincts.  Reluctantly, he 
    unsheathes a HUNTING KNIFE and hands it to TeenageDexter.

                                        HARRY
                      Why don t you goahead, son.  Put the 
                        poor animal out of its misery.

    Teenage Dexter looks in wonder from his father to the 
    wounded deer.

                                        TEENAGEDEXTER
                        Really?

                                        HARRY 
                      For now, this is how we ll control the 
                        urges you feel.  Channel them.

    Teenage Dexter takes the knife, barely believing.  He steps 
    forward and kneels OUT OF FRAME.  PUSH INTO Harry, hoping 
    this is a good idea...

                                        HARRY
                        This deer will put meat on our table 
                        tonight.  It serves a purpose.

                                                                    END FLASHBACK:

    EXT. POLICE STATION - KITCHEN- DAY 21818

    A tired Doakes fixes a cup of coffee.  On the counter, he 
    notices a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE on the memorial for fallen 
    officer Ricky Simmons and his wife Kara, with separate 
    photos of each.  Doakes picks up the story.  PUSH IN on 
    KARA s photo.  As he stares at his slain lover, Doakes is 
    flooded with anger.  It s time to do something about this.

    EXT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - COURTYARD - DAY 21919

    CLOSE on Doakes entering a Spanish courtyard.  FOLLOW him 
    through a crowd of mingling CHURCH MEMBERS, on the heels of 
    a Confirmation ceremony. 


                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     21.

    He moves through TEENAGERS dressed for Confirmation,
    receivinghugs and handshakes from FAMILY MEMBERS.

    Doakes scans the courtyard, until he spots --

    ROSE, 15, Latino, awkward but beautiful, wearing a virginal 
    white gown.  A Catholic BISHOP, 70s, full white hair and red 
    vestments, clasps her hand in his hands.

                                        BISHOP
                      I m very proud of you.  You worked 
                        hard for this.

                                        ROSE
                        Thankyou, Bishop.

    Rose smiles and steps away to find her friends -- but bumps 
    into Doakes, now strategically positioned in her path. 

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      Hi, Rose.  Congratulations on your 
                          Confirmation.

                                        ROSE
                        Thank you.  Do I know you?

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      My name s James Doakes.  Miami-Metro 
                      PD.  I m investigating the murder of 
                      an undercover officer and his wife.

                                        ROSE
                        That s terrible.  Were they members of 
                      the church?

    Rose couldn t be sweeter or more innocent.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      No, Rose.  They weren t.

                                        ROSE
                                (confused)
                      Oh?

    Doakes pulls out a PHOTO of Ricky Simmons and holds it up.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Have you ever seen this man?

    In the background, for the first time we see kingpin CARLOS 
    GUERRERO and his wife CELESTE, talking to other churchgoers.  
    A Guerrero ASSOCIATE urgently taps his boss on the shoulder 
    and points out Doakes. 


                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     22.

                        I don t know.  Why are you asking me?

                                        GUERRERO
                        Hey!  Getaway from my daughter!

    Doakes turns to see Guerrero angrily racing over, pushing 
    people aside.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        What?  C mon...

    Trying to provoke Guerrero into a fight, Doakes holds up his 
    hands, like  Take a shot.   Guerrero pushes people aside and 
    lunges at Doakes to do just that, but some of his associates 
    wisely hold him back.  Guerrero strains to get to Doakes --

                                        GUERRERO
                        Atmy church?  In front of my family?

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Rickyand Kara had families, too.

    Everyone in the church has turned to watch.

                                        ROSE
                                (scared)
                        What s he saying, Daddy?

                        Come on, honey.  Let s go.

    Celeste escorts away Rose.  Guerrero forces down his fury, 
    shrugs off the associates holding him, and faces Doakes.

                                        GUERRERO
                      You just opened a dangerous door.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Naw, man.  You did.  When you murdered 
                        a cop.  And an innocent lady.  You 
                        don t follow the rules, Guerrero.  Why 
                        should I?

    The Bishop calmly approaches.

                                        BISHOP 
                        This is a placeof worship, officer.  
                        I need to ask you to leave.  Go in

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      Not likely.

    EXT. CALLE OCHO - NIGHT 22121

    Little Havana.  The heart of Cuban Miami.  A time warp into 
    an alternate reality of hand-rolled cigars, fruiterias, meat 
    markets, and windows with cafecitos for only 25 cents.

    At a corner traffic light, four motley hookers in slinky 
    dresses and strappy heels -- SHANDA (Black, attitude), 
    GABRIELLE (Latino, trashy),BELLA (Latino, demure), and a 
    FOURTH HOOKER -- lift their skirts to display their wares.  
    Appreciative drivers HONK.  

    Debra, wearing her business suit, approaches the girls on 
    the street.  They turn and break out familiar smiles.

                                        SHANDA

                      I m a cop.

    The girls look at each othernervously.  The Fourth Hooker 
    turns and bolts, doing her best to run in high heels.

                      We can get him, you guys.  You just 
                        gotta give me something.  Any of you 
                      see Cherry with anyone the night 
                        before last?

                        I saw Cherry get in a car.  Come to 
                        think of it, she didn t come back.  
                      And I was working all night.

    Rita sits at a bus stop, surrounded by the city s underpaid

    Rita hangs up.  Nervous, she stares at the street and starts 
    discreetly snapping the rubber band against her wrist.

    INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY 32525

    Packed with UNIFORM COPS and DETECTIVES, including Dexter, 
    Debra and Batista.  Doakes briefs the group from the front, 
    with LaGuerta off to the side.  

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      As you all know, a night watchman from 
                      the hockey arena s missing.  Till now, 
                      we presumed he was abducted, or worse, 
                      by the Ice Truck Killer.

    Doakes nods to someone offscreen, and a grainy SURVEILLANCE 
    VIDEO starts playing on the HUGE SCREEN behind Doakes.  The 
    tape shows a MAN in a security uniform hauling chopped BODY 
    PARTS across the ice and stacking them in the goalie s net.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        However, we searched his apartment and 
                        found a stolen surveillance tape from 
                      the night of the murder.  Chief of 
                        security at the arena confirmed it... 
                      the man you re looking at is Tony 
                        Tucci, the missing night watchman.

    Dexter and Debra watch in shock.  LaGuerta steps up.

                        Here s the best part.  Tucci s got a 
                        record.  Pulled a knife at a party in 
                         97.

    LaGuerta nods and the tape stops.  A STILL IMAGE appears on 
    the big screen -- the grinning employee ID photo of Tony 
    Tucci, a simple blue-collar type.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Ladies and gentleman, I give you Tony

                        Does he drive a station wagon?

                        Tucci.  What kind of car s he drive?  
                      The last victim was seen getting in --

                              (to the room)
                        From this moment forward, all our 
                        resources go into finding this man.  
                        Your individual assignments will be 
                        coming shortly.  That s all for now.

    The briefing breaks and the detectives start buzzing.  Debra 
    stands and turns to Dexter in frustration.  Dexter stares at 
    the projected photo of Tucci.

                                        DEBRA
                      It doesn t make sense.  After being so 
                        careful for so long, why in the hell 
                        would he leave recorded evidence?

    Debra angrily turns to go and brushes past Batista.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     29.

    HOLD for a beat on Batista, who was listening to her words, 
    before he heads out with everyone else.  Dexter stays in his 
    seat, staring up at the grinning face of Tony Tucci.

                      Of course, I agree with my sister.

                        placement to placement, committed a 
                        crime, ended up in juvie.

                      You should keep the faith.  The system 
                        works, now and then.  I was taken in 
                      by a wonderful family.  No abuse.  In 
                        fact, my foster father understood I 
                      had special needs.  Without him...

                        You d be like that kid.  You re lucky.

    Rita comes running up the driveway, panting and smiling and 
    looking eternally grateful to Dexter.  She mouths  thank 
    you  to him as she leads Laura into the house.

                        I am lucky.  What do I know about 
                        abuse?  Without the Code of Harry, I m 
                        sure I would ve committed a senseless 
                        murder in my youth.  Just to watch the 
                        blood flow.

    As a troubled Dexter watches Rita head inside --

                                                                            FLASHBACK:

    INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY2727

    Dexter and Debra, both early 20s, stand over a hospital bed.  
    Harry, looking green against the sheets, lies with his eyes 
    closed, hooked up to an IV.A sturdy nurse named MARY -- 
    the one we foreshadowed earlier -- fluffs up his pillows.  
    On her way out, she whispers to Dexter and Debra.

                                        MARY
                        Just try to make him comfortable.  
                        It s about all we can do now.

                                        DEBRA
                              (torn apart)
                        I don t understand.  A week ago the 
                        doctor said he was getting better.

                                        MARY
                                (all-wise)
                      He isgetting better, sweetie.  A body 
                        cannot suffer in sweet repose.

    She pushes a nurse s cart out, past an unconscious OLD 
    PATIENT in the next bed.  Annoyed, Debra calls after Mary.

                                        DEBRA
                        What does that mean?
                              (to Dexter)
                        What the hell s that mean?

                                        DEXTER
                        That she s weird?

    Harry opens his eyes and rolls his head toward his children, 
    as if some invisible hand pushed it from the far side of the 
    pillow.

                                        HARRY
                        Listen you two, I m not gonna be 
                        around much longer.

                        this.  If you fight.

    Debra s grief can be seen in the tears she angrily brushes 
    back.  Dexter holds his pain inside.

                                        HARRY
                        I am fighting, honey.  With every 
                        breath.
                              (to Dexter)
                        When I m gone, I can t stop you... 
                        from being who you are. Sooner or 
                        later, you ll -- need -- to do it.

    Dexter nods, scared.  But Debra has no idea what Harry is 
    talking about.

                                        DEBRA
                      Do what?

                              (to Dexter)
                        Just remember our lessons.

                        about?

                              (to Debra)
                        I never worried about you, Debra.  You 
                      got your mom s spirit.  But Dexter, he 
                        required extra handling.

                                        DEXTER
                                (simply)
                        I can t make it without you.

                                        HARRY
                      Yes you can.  If you feel like you re 
                        slipping, you lean on your sister.  
                        She ll keep you... connected.  You re 
                        a better person than you think, Dex.

    As Dexter wonders if that s really true --

    INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY 32828

    REVEAL Batista closely watching the tape on a TV set in the 
    mostly empty bullpen.  Debra enters with her nose in a FILE.

                                        DEBRA
                        Tucci s hair and fibers.

    She looks at the TV screen to see Tucci holding the victim s 
    WRAPPED TORSO.  

                                        DEBRA
                        Ofcoursehis hair and fibers are on 
                      the body.  He s hauling her around 
                        with his pork hands, isn t he?  Pretty 
                        fucking peculiar behavior for a genius 
                        serial killer, if you ask me.

    Disgusted, she tosses the file onto a desk.

                                        DEBRA
                      Any word from the chemlab?

                                        BATISTA
                        Same as the other bodies.  The killer 
                        used liquid nitrogen to preserve the 
                        tissue.  Give it that bleached look.

                      And they still think it s Tucci?  
                          Unbelievable.

                                        BATISTA
                        Yeah, you know how unstable liquid 
                        nitrogen is?  You gotta be a serious 
                      lab rat to mess around with that shit.  
                        Tucci didn t even pass high school 
                        chemistry.

                                        DEBRA
                      So wait -- you agree with me?  About 
                        Tucci?

                      Why do you think I m going over this 
                        surveillance tape?

    Intrigued, Debra moves over to Batista, who hasn t taken his 
    eyes off the TV screen the whole time.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     34.

                        Come here.  Watch carefully.

    Deb stares at the screen.  As Tucci places the wrapped torso 
    inside the net, he subtly TURNS HIS HEAD as if responding to 
    someone off screen, then adjusts the position of the torso.

                      You see that?  Right before he 
                        repositioned the torso?

    EXT. HOMESTEAD HALFWAY HOUSE - DAY3(DUSK)2929

    A rundown boarding house with a sign that says:  Welcome to 
    Homestead Halfway House. Jeremy and a somewhat frail boy 
    named LUCAS -- an 18-year-old runt of the litter -- exit the 
    house joking and laughing.

    marshy area.  A  NO TRESPASSING  sign on the fence.

    WAY DOWN THE STREET

    A familiar car sits under a tree.

    Dexter sits inside, shadowing Jeremy.  He watches as Lucas 
    overcomes his fear and starts climbing the chain-link to 
    break into the marsh.  Dexter raises binoculars for a better 
    look.

    LONG-LENS POV

    As Jeremy climbs, his shirt lifts and Dexter spots the GLINT 
    of the skinning knife strapped to Jeremy s hip.

                        Bingo.  I know what happens next in 
                        this gruesome little scenario.  Jeremy 
                      is trying to recreate his first kill, 
                        ritualize it.  I ve got what I need.

    As Dexter puts his binoculars back in the case, PAN to the 
    front window, through which we see the boys in the distance 
    clear the high fence and run off into the marsh.            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     36.



    INT. POLICE STATION - VIEWING ROOM- DAY3(DUSK)3333

    Debra shows CAPTAIN MATTHEWS the security tape FREEZE FRAMED 
    on Tucci s turned head.

                                        DEBRA
                      See the look on his face?  Like he s 
                        scared.  Like he s got a gun pointed 
                      at him.

                        It s not much to go on, Debra.  A look 
                      off camera?

                      the victim get into a panel wagon the 
                        night of her death.  That was the last 
                        time anyone saw the victim.

    Debra, on a roll, hands a file to the Captain.

                                        DEBRA
                        I checked Tucci s background report.  
                      He doesn t even owna car.  I m 
                        telling you, there s no fucking way he 
                      can be the Ice Truck Killer.

    Captain Matthews appears impressed, but circumspect.

                                        CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
                        What s Lieutenant LaGuertathink of

                        I don t want to hear it, officer.  You

                        I gave you a shot in homicide because 
                        I think you can make a halfway decent 
                        detective, but I ll put you right back 
                      on the street if you can t swim in 
                        these waters.  Got it?

                                        DEBRA
                        Yes, sir.

    Captain Matthews turns to go, then pauses --

                                        CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
                        Your fathernever would ve pulled the 
                        shit you just did.

    That hurts.  The Captain exits, leaving Debra chastised.

    EXT. MARSH- SWAMPY AREA- DAY3(DUSK)3434

    An extremely LOW ANGLE, an inch above water, gazing out over 
    the blackness of a swampy WATER HAZARD.  On the far side, 
    close to the water, stand Jeremy and Lucas.  It all feels 
    creepy.

                                        LUCAS
                        I don t see it.

    Jeremy points right INTO CAMERA.

                                        JEREMY
                        It s right there.  See its eyes 
                        sticking up?

    AT THE WATER S EDGE

    Lucas looks into the murky water.  Jeremy stands slightly 
    behind him.

                                        JEREMY
                      You have to get closer.

    Lucas nervously steps right to the water s edge.  Any closer 
    and he d fall in.  Lucas looks out over the water.

                                        LUCAS
                        I still don t see it.

                                        JEREMY
                        Really?  Huh.  Maybe I was wrong.

    Lucas looks back at the bigger boy, suddenly realizing.

                                        LUCAS
                        There s no gator here, is there?

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     38.

    Jeremy shrugs.  Dark.  Menacing.

                                        JEREMY
                        I don t know, Lucas.  Is there?

    It s a tense, uncomfortable moment.  Lucas is helpless.  He 
    knows it.  We know it.  Jeremy smiles, the smile of a 
    predator in control --

                                        VOICE
                        Excuse me!

    They turn to see Dexter materializing out of the trees as he 
    walks toward them.  He strolls right up to the boys, who are 
    frozen by his sudden appearance.

                                        DEXTER
                        Anyone see aFrisbee?  It flew in here 
                        somewhere.

    Jeremy impulsively takes off running.  Lucas follows a beat 
    behind.  Dexter watches the boys run away.  After they flee 
    from sight, he looks around at his surroundings.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        What am I doing out here?

    Dexter is about to head back, when he hears a SPLASH behind 
    him.  Dexter turns -- as a 12-FOOTALLIGATOR lunges out of 
    the water.  Dexter leaps away but trips, falls, and quickly 
    scrambles back to his feet.

                                        DEXTER
                      Son of a bitch!

    EXT. PARKING LOT- DAY3(DUSK)3535

    Dexter, angry and wet, limps across the empty parking lot.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      All I had to do was drive home.  Have 
                        a taco.  Plan my attack.  Instead, 
                        dearly deluded Dexter tried to act 
                        human.  Like it s myjobto save 
                        lives.

    He reaches his car -- to find the passengerwindow SMASHED.  
    Oh hell.  Dexter opens the door and more glass falls from 
    the window.  Dexter checks the glove box.  Emptied out.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      The Code of Harry never covered this.  
                      At least I know what Jeremy is -- and 
                        what I need to do.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     39.

    As Dexter angrily slams the glove box closed --

                                                                            FLASHBACK:

    INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT3636

    CLOSE ON a hypodermic needle filling up with liquid.  The 
    needle slowly rises to face of Mary, who s holding the 
    syringe.  She squirts out the air bubble.  RACK FOCUS to 
    Harry, lying behind her in bed, looking very close to death.

                                        HARRY
                              (very faint)
                        Wait...

    FIND Dexter sitting on the edge of the bed.  Dexter turns to 
    his dying father to see a small spark shining in his eyes.

                                        DEXTER
                        What Dad?

                                        HARRY
                        Don t let her...

    Mary, not hearing Harry (or ignoring him), turns with the 
    needle and gently lifts Harry s frail arm.

                                        MARY
                        Okay, my brave little soldier.  Let s 
                      get this nasty shot over with.

                                        HARRY
                        No... no shot...

    Dexter sees the horror in his father s eyes.  Just before 
    Mary plunges the needle into Harry s raised blue vein, 
    Dexter reaches out and restrains her arm.

                                        DEXTER
                        Wait.

    In SLOW MOTION, Mary s eyes snap to Dexter and fix him with 
    a look of cold rage.  It mirrors the rage we watched earlier 
    in Jeremy s eyes.  Dexter registers the look, before we 
    RESUME NORMAL SPEED and Mary breaks out a granola smile.

                                        MARY
                        What is it, honey?

                                        DEXTER
                      He doesn t want the shot.




                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     40.

                                        MARY
                        Your father is very sick.  He s in a 
                      lot of pain.

    She holds up the needle, and a melodramatic SHAFT OF LIGHT 
    from the window shines through it like her own Holy Grail.

                                        MARY
                      He needs a shot.

    Harry s hand slowly reaches for Dexter s hand and gives it a 
    squeeze.  Dexter looks down at his frail father, fighting 
    his way up through the fog.

                                        HARRY
                        I want... pain.

    Dexter smiles and looks at Mary.

                                        DEXTER
                      He wants pain.

    Mary forces down a savage roar and replaces it with a 
    petulant shake of her head.

                                        MARY
                        I ll have to tell the doctor.He 
                        won t be happy that you re refusing 
                        your medication.

    She turns on her heels and sails out into the hallway like 
    some large and deadly bird.  Dexter looks back at Harry.

                                        HARRY
                        You... can tell.

                                        DEXTER
                        About the nurse?  Yeah.  She s like 
                      me.  How could youtell?

                                        HARRY
                      She gives... too much...
                              (he gasps in pain and 
                                closes his eyes)
                        ...too much morphine.  It s making me 
                        worse.

                        She s drugging you.  Killing by

    Harry swivels his head and nods at the other bed.  Dexter 
    looks over -- and we reveal for the first time that it s 
    EMPTY.  The old patient gone.  Dexter turns back to Harry.

                                        DEXTER
                        What should I do?

    Harry gives Dexter s hand a squeeze.

                        Stop her.

                        What can I do for you, Captain?

    He takes a seat on the couch, assuming control of the room.

    Rita speaks low and turns away from the lobby for privacy.

    INT. RITA S HOUSE - DAY 44040

    Dexter runs through the house with a child under each arm, 
    like he s a twin-engine airplane.  Astor doesn t look any 
    worse for the wear.  Dexter sets them down in the kitchen.

                      Now Master Cody, let s see what we can 
                      do about that splinter.  Sit.

    Cody sits at the kitchen table.  Dexter pulls a washcloth 
    from his pocket and unrolls it to reveal tweezers, a needle, 
    cotton, a Band Aid -- echoes of his kill tools.  Dexter 
    takes Cody s hand and gently touches his RED FINGER TIP.

                                        DEXTER
                        It s a deep one.  Might sting a bit, 
                      but the magical Splinter Fairy will 
                        soon make you forget all about it.

    Dexter tries to get hold of the splinter with the tweezers.

                        Second cousin of the Tooth Fairy.  She 
                        leaves candy if you put your splinter 
                        under your pillow at night.

    In the background, Rita enters the house with groceries.

                        I know there s no Tooth Fairy.  She s

                      Hi babies.

    The kids turn to say hello.  With Cody distracted, Dexter 
    yanks the splinter free.  Cody jumps.

                      Ow!

    Dexter holds up the gnarly SPLINTER, with a drop of blood.

                                        DEXTER
                        You re right Cody, no such thing as 
                      the Boogey Man.  But the Splinter 
                        Fairy?  She s the real deal.

    Big crocodile tears start brimming in Cody s eyes.

                        Will she still leave candy if I cry?

    Rita, hugging Astor now under her arm, smiles at this man 
    taking care of her son.  They almost look like a normal 
    family.  Well, almost.

    EXT. CALLE OCHO - DAY4(DUSK)4141

    Debra roams the sidewalk alone, searching the street.  
    Weaving through HOOKERS hawking their wares.  CUBANO MEN 
    sipping espressos.  TEEN RUNAWAYS looking for handouts.

    ACROSS THE STREET

    She spots a classic Fleetline STATION WAGON, light color 
    with paneled wood sides, trolling the street in SLOW MOTION.

    AN SUV

    Pulls up, blocking Debra s line of sight.  She runs around 
    the SUV and bolts into the street.  A car SLAMS ITS BRAKES, 
    nearly hitting Debra.  The DRIVER curses out the window.  
    Debra holds up a hand, sorry, and races across the street, 
    forcing another car to swerve and HONK.

    AT A STOP LIGHT

    She reaches the rear of the Fleetline Station Wagon stopped 
    at the light and hurries along the side, trying to peer in, 
    but the windows are tinted.  When she reaches the passenger 
    window, which is rolled down, Debra looks inside --

    -- and sees a wrinkled ANCIENT MAN behind the wheel, with 
    his AGED WIFE riding shotgun.  She smiles a creepy toothless 
    smile at Debra and waves in SLOW MOTION, as the light turns 
    green and the Fleetline drives away.  Off Debra --

    The other clowns join McNamara in derisive laughter as they 
    turn like three linebackers from a huddle and bound up the 
    walkway toward the house, leaving a tortured Doakes by the 
    car.  He hears the door BUST OPEN, furniture THROWN, then a

    From seemingly nowhere, a FAMILIAR SHADOW blindsidesJeremy, 
    who lets out a reflexive grunt, and pile-drives him into a 
    column.  REVEAL Dexter, the real Boogey Man, holding Jeremy 
    firmly from behind.  He leans close, whispers menacingly.

                                        DEXTER
                        You re mine now.

                                        JEREMY
                                (terrified)
                        What do you want?

                                        DEXTER
                        Silence.

    Dexter SLAMS his body into Jeremy, flattening the boy s face 
    against the column, so that he can pull the SYRINGE from his 
    jacket pocket.  As he raises it to Jeremy s neck --

                                        JEREMY
                                (acting tough)
                      You gonna fuck me, faggot?   Cause I 
                        killed the last guy who raped me.

    Shocked, Dexter pauses with the needle hovering.

                                        DEXTER
                        What guy?




                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     50.

    Jeremy, afraid, doesn t say anything.  Dexter lowers the 
    syringe with one hand and forcefully spins Jeremy around 
    with the other, so he s looking into his eyes.  No time for 
    bullshit here.

                                        DEXTER
                      He rapedyou?  The boy you killed when 
                      you were fifteen?

    Jeremy, his face lit by a SHAFT OF LIGHT beaming through a 
    high window, struggles valiantly not to cry.

                                        DEXTER
                      Why didn t you tell someone?

                                        JEREMY
                                (burning with shame)
                        Would you?  He fucked me and I killed 
                      him and if you try I ll kill you, too.

    Despite Jeremy s best effort, tears start rolling down his 
    face.  Dexter stares at his victim with sudden realization.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I understand now.  Why didn t I see it 
                        before?  Jeremy didn t murder that boy 
                        four years ago...

    Jeremy suddenly TRANSFORMS into TeenageDexter, and for an 
    instant, Dexter holds his own young life in his hands.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        ...hewas taking out the garbage.  
                        Just like I do.

    Young Dexter TRANSFORMS BACK to Jeremy.  Dexter, rattled, 
    slides the lethal syringe into his pocket without Jeremy 
    ever seeing it.  He doesn t, however, loosen his grip around 
    the kid s neck.

                                        DEXTER
                                (still scary)
                        Look, I reallydon t wanna cancel all 
                      my credit cards, and I hatewaiting in 
                        line at the DMV, so give me the wallet 
                      you stole from my car -- or I ll break 
                        your fucking neck.

                                        JEREMY
                      In my backpack.

    Dexter lets go of Jeremy and unzips his backpack.  As Dexter 
    digs for his wallet, Jeremy watches Dexter, trying to figure 
    out who this guy is and what he s about.  

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     51.

    Dexter finds his wallet, tosses the backpack to Jeremy, and 
    walks out of the room.  Jeremy can t believe it.

    INT. HOMESTEAD HALFWAY HOUSE - HALLWAY- NIGHT 44747

    Jeremy catches up to Dexter about to leave the building and 
    calls after him.

                                        JEREMY
                      Is that all?

    Dexter stops and turns back to Jeremy.  An overhead LAMP 
    holds them both in a pool of light, with the rest of the 
    area fading dramatically into darkness.

                                        DEXTER
                      You want more?

    Jeremy nervously shakes his head no.  Dexter stares at him 
    for a beat.

                                        DEXTER
                        That boy who raped you four years ago.  
                      Did he deserve to die?

    Jeremy thinks and then nods with unerring certainty.

                                        JEREMY
                        Yeah... he did.

                                        DEXTER
                        Well, the boy last night didn t.  
                        Remember that.  It might save your 
                        life one day.

    With that, the Boogey Man turns to go.  As he walks INTO 
    CAMERA, showing no emotion --

                                                                            FLASHBACK:

    INT. ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT - NIGHT4848

    The back kitchendoor opens and Mary enters, dressed in her 
    hospital wear.  She deadbolts the door behind her, sets down 
    her purse, and looks around.

                                        MARY
                      Mr. Tinker?  Where are you, Mr. 
                        Tinker?

    She hears a faraway MEOW.

                                        MARY
                      Mr. Tinker?

    CONTINUED:4848


    Mary walks through the dark, shadowy kitchen.  It s a sweet 
    place really, full of cute and craftsy knickknacks, but they 
    only add to the building sense of dread.  Mary hears another 
    MEOW.

                                        MARY
                      Are you hiding behind the couch again, 
                      Mr. Tinker Stinker?

    She walks toward the living room and sees --

    MARY S POV

    Every conceivable inch of the living room, from floor to 
    ceiling and everything between, is covered in PAINTER S 
    PLASTIC.  The clear polyethylene film makes everything in 
    the room appear both shiny and blurry, like a dream of a 
    room.  Sitting atop the plastic-covered couchis MR. TINKER, 
    who MEOWS.

    MARY

    Only has a confused and horrified beat to take all of this 
    in -- before twentysomething Dexter MATERIALIZES from the 
    shadows behind her.  But Mary hears him and turns to see 
    Dexter wearing a surgical mask, gloves and cap, and holding 
    up a SYRINGE, just like the one shewas using on Harry.

    There s a surprised, awkward beat -- before Dexter plunges 
    the needle into Mary s neck.  But before he can press the 
    plunger, the big-boned Mary twists freeand yanks the needle 
    from her neck. 

    The terrified Mary opens her mouth to scream -- but Dexter 
    tackles her to the ground before she can make a sound and 
    covers her mouth with his hand.  As the two awkwardly roll 
    around on the plastic --

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Things were a little messy in the 
                        beginning.  Hey, perfecting a new 
                        craft takes time.  But I was trained 
                        well.  Those who witnessed my early 
                        stumbles never had a chance to tell.

    Unable to get Mary under control, Dexter, palm still firmly 
    over her mouth, finally grabs her head with both hands and 
    SLAMS it into the floor.  ONCE.  TWICE.  BLACK.            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     53.



    FADE FROM BLACK - A SHORT TIME LATER4949

    Mary stirs awake to find herself lying naked on her plastic-
    covered dining table, wrapped tightly in clearplastic that 
    straps her arms to her side.  Her mouth is stuffed with 
    thick wads of white gauze.

    Wide eyed, Mary rotates her head to see Dexter sitting on a 
    dining room chair in surgical wear, flipping through a 
    frilly photo album full of OBITS FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS.

                                        DEXTER
                        I ve been reading through your photo 
                        album.  Hope you don t mind.

    Panicked, she tries to speak, but it sounds like GRUNTS with 
    the gauze in her mouth.  Dexter indicates the album.

                                        DEXTER
                      Are all your victims in here?
                                (offher GRUNTS)
                      I m sorry, let me help you with that.

    Dexter starts to remove the gauze, then pauses, remembering 
    something.  He pulls the SKINNING KNIFE from his youth out 
    of his pocket and holds it close to her face.

                                        DEXTER
                        Scream.  And lose a tongue.

    He removes the gauze.  Mary bursts into tears.

                                        MARY
                        I helped them, all of them... They 
                        were sick... I took away their pain.

                                        DEXTER
                                (smiles)
                          I understand.

    Dexter stuffs the gauze back into her mouth.

                                        DEXTER
                      And now it s time to take away your
                        pain.  I ve been waiting a very long 
                        time for this.

    Mary launches into a primal struggle against her bonds but 
    it s useless.  Dexter secured her well.  He raises his knife 
    and looks over her body in anticipation, trying to decide 
    where to begin.  PUSH INTO Dexter.  As he makes his first 
    cut, blood spurts onto his chest.  He looks down.  That was 
    unexpected.

                      It was messier than I anticipated, but 
                        still a special day.  The Nurse was my 
                        first playmate--and I ll always be 
                        grateful to her for opening up so many 
                        magnificent new doors for me.

    As Dexter speaks, PAN to Mr. Tinker watching impassively 
    from atop theplastic-wrapped couch.  Offthe cat sMEOW --

    INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY5050

    Twentysomething Debra bursts from the hospital room pushing 
    Harry in a wheelchair, his color and strength back again.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      But of course it was really Harry, 
                        wise and wonderful Harry, who paved 
                      the road to my salvation.

    A jubilant Debra spins Harry in a circle, laughing.

                                        HARRY
                      For God s sake, Debra.  You re gonna 
                      put me right back in the hospital.

    Dexter steps out of the hospital room.  He leans against the 
    doorway and smiles, watching his father and sister together.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        With the Nurse put down, Harry lived 
                        another year before hardening arteries 
                        squeezed the last bit of life from 
                        him.  But his lessons never failed me.

                                                                    END FLASHBACK:

    EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 55151

    Doakes exits the police station.  Across the street, he sees 
    a DANCING CLOWN -- with floppy shoes, a big nose, and full 
    face makeup -- waving around a HUGE SIGN that says  Condos 
    for Sale.    

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Harry taught me that death isn t the 
                        end.  It s the beginning of a chain 
                        reaction that will catch you if you re 
                      not careful.

    As Doakes walks by staring, the Dancing Clown stops dancing.  
    He eerily looks Doakes in the eye, holds his fingers in the 
    shape of a gun, and fake fires at Doakes.  A message from 
    Guerrero.            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     55.



    INT. CAFETER A - DAY 55252

    The down-low neighborhood joint we established on Calle 
    Ocho.  LaGuerta sits on wooden chairs with a group of OLD 
    CUBAN MEN, smoking hand-rolled cigars and speaking Spanish.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      He taught me that none of us are who we 
                        appear to be on the outside.  But we 
                        must maintain appearances to survive.

    LaGuerta laughs with the old men.  Just one of the guys.  In 
    the corner, nobody even notices the big TV with a NEWSCAST
    of LaGuerta talking about the Ice Truck Killer.

    EXT. RITA S HOUSE - YARD - DAY 55353

    CLOSE ON a stream of water.  PULL BACK to find lovely Rita 
    watering the vibrant new LEMON TREE in front of her house.

                      But there was something Harry didn t 
                        teach me.  Something he didn t know.  
                        Couldn t possibly know.

    On the sidewalk, Astor and Cody sit behind a crude homemade 
    Lemonade Stand with a pitcher of ice-cold lemonade and cups.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      The willful taking of life represents 
                      the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

    The family hears a CAR HORN play  Hallelujah  and they turn 
    to see Dexter pulling into the driveway in a 1970s Cadillac
    convertible, pimped out with chrome spinners and airbrushed 
    artwork, including a sanguine picture of Jesus on the hood.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      It leaves you an outsider.  Forever 
                        looking in.  Searching for company to 
                        keep.

    CLOSE on Dexter s keys hanging from the ignition -- with the 
    BARBIE DOLL HEAD from the Ice Truck Killer attached as a 
    keychain.

    Astor and Cody and Rita run over to check out the car, which 
    says  ChristoSalva  on the back. Dexter gets out to greet 
    them.

                      Can we get in?

                                        DEXTER
                      You better.

    Dexter watches the overjoyed children hop into the car and 
    feel the red-velvet seats.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      All you can do is play along at life 
                      and hope that sometimes you get it 
                        right.

    Dexter looks back at the luminous Rita, who is staring at 
    him, touched beyond words.

                                        RITA
                        Thank you...

    Her eyes brim with tears as she kisses Dexter.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Score one for the little wooden boy.

    Dexter puts his arm around Rita and they turn to watch the 
    kids playing with the FUZZY CROSS that hangs from the rear 
    view.  Off this fractured family tableau --

                                                                            FADE OUT.
