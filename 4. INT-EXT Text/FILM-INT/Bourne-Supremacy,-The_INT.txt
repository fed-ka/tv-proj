I'll get the book.
BOURNE
No.
There's nothing new.
MARIE
You're sure?
(he nods)
We should still -- we should write it
down.
BOURNE
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --

BOURNE

She lays her hands on his shoulders, steadies him.
MARIE
We write them down because sooner or

good.

BOURNE

I do remember something good.
All the

She smiles.
Kisses him.
Leads him back in.

MARIE getting BOURNE into the bed. Turning down the light.
Getting him settled. Waiting for that pill to kick in.
What would he do without her?
BOURNE
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
MARIE
I worry when you get like this.

BOURNE
It's just a nightmare.
MARIE
I don't mean that.
I worry when you try
to ignore it.
He
hesitates. But that gets him. He knows she's right.
And
with that opening, he's letting go. Resistance
fol
ding. Almost childlike. She's gathering him in.
He'
s letting her do it...
MARIE (CONT'D)
Sleep.
Sleep now.
BOURNE
I should be better by now.
MARIE
You are better. And I think it's not
memories at all. It's just a dream you
keep having over and over.
BOURNE
But it ends up the same.
MARIE
One day it will be different. It just
takes time.
(beat)
We'll make new memories. You and me.
Silence. She strokes his face. He gives in to her
tenderness. He's fading. Two waifs in the dark.

MARIE back from the market, putting the groceries away.
Almost done, when she stops for a moment --

MARIE smiles.

She's my sister. There's been a

A NOTE ON THE TABLE:
"I'M AT THE BEACH"
BOURNE has just come in -- just read the note -- balling it
quickly. In fact, everything is quickly now, because --
BOURNE is bailing.
Fast. Calm. Methodical. Some exfil procedure that he's
honed and choreographed. Packing like a machine --
RAPID TIME CUTS

For crissake, Marty, you knew Conklin.

MARSHALL signals for quiet...
MARSHALL
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam.

PAMELA
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in

As NEVINS flashes his credentials to CARABINIERI at door,
who gives an unimpressed shrug and lets him in.
NEVINS takes his overcoat off, tosses it on the empty
chair. We see a big ass .45 for just a second under his
suit jacket.
NEVINS
Alright, Mr.
Bourne, is that your name?
(BOURN
E nods)
Name's Nevin

Could I see
your passport?
BOURNE, silent, hands over his passport.

NEVINS studies Bourne's passport...

Whatever Nevins is being told, it's concerning.
BOURNE
watching him. Knows exactly what this is.
CLOSE ON NEVINS as he steps away, listening intently. His
hand just starting to move toward his shoulder holster.
NEVINS (cont'd)
Okay, I'll call you right back.
NEVINS flips shut his phone.
He reaches for his gun, even
as he turns, and --
BOURNE is right there in his face. WHUMP! Momentum and
gravity reaching mutual agreement as NEVINS hits the deck.
CARABINIERI barely clears his holster before -- CHOP --

Inside a hanger. Inside an office. ABBOTT watching as
CRONIN questions NICKY. PAMELA sits on a window sill.
CRONIN
So your cover at the time was what?
NICKY
That I was an American student in Paris.
CRONIN
What exactly did your job with Treadstone
in Paris consist of?
Nicky looks to Abbott. He nods that it's okay to
*
answer. Pamela bristles at the check-off.
*
40.
NICKY
Ih
ad two re
sponsibilities. One was
to
coo
rdinate l
ogistical operations. Th
e
oth
er was to
monitor the health of th
e
age
nts, to m
ake sure they were up to
date
wit
h their m
edications.
CRONIN
Health, meaning what?
NICKY
Their mental health.
Because of what
they'd been through.
They were prone to a
variety of problems.
PAMELA
(losing patience)
*
What kind of problems?
NICKY
Depression. Anger. Compulsive
behaviors. They had physical symptoms --
headaches -- sensitivity to light --
PAMELA
*
Amnesia?
*
NICKY
Before this?
Before Bourne?
No.
NICKY gets agitated.
ABBOTT steps in, fatherly, good
*
cop.
*
ABBOTT
Were you familiar with the training
program?
NICKY
The details? No. I mean,
I was told it
was voluntary. I don't kno
w if that's
true or not, but that's wha
t I was told.
(a bit defensive)
Look, they took vulnerable
subjects,
okay? You mix that with th
e right
pharmacology and some serio
us behavior
modification, and, I don't
know, I mean,
I guess anything's possible

ZORN arrives from outside.

There's a car for you.

Everybody moving. NICKY relieved. She's off the hook.

PAMELA
Are you an expert in amnesia?
NICKY
Look, what do you want me to say?
I was there. I believed him.
PAMELA
Believed what?
NICKY
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered
a severe traumatic breakdown.

PAMELA
So he fooled you.
NICKY

If you say so.

PAMELA
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young
people in Paris? Dangerous missions?
Life and death?
NICKY
(incredulous)
You mean, did I want a date?
PAMELA
Did you?
NICKY
These were killers. Conklin had them all
jacked up. They were Dobermans.
PAMELA
Some women like Dobermans --
NICKY
What do you want from me?
I was
reassigned. I'm out.

Everything stops, as THE PHOTO -- blurry, oblique -- begins

Suddenly, they're surrounded by Bourne.
PAMELA

Is it him?
Looking closer -- she nods...
CRONIN
He's not hiding, that's for sure.
ZORN
Why Naples?
Why now?
PAMELA has gone quiet, just staring at the picture, as --

ABBOTT looks skeptical.
ABBOTT

And then, from behind them --
NICKY

Wheeling around. The salaryman is JARDA.
JARDA from

BOURNE behind him.
Bigger gun.
Waiting.
So ready.
BOURNE
I emptied it.
JARDA

Felt a little light.
BOURNE
Drop it.
JARDA lets the gun fall, looks his old comrade over a beat.
But Bourne's not interested in a reunion.
BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)

Bourne tosses him FLEXCUFFS -- JARDA puts his hands behind
his back, turns to let BOURNE cinch them.
BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)

JARDA
What do you want?
BOURNE
Conklin.
JARDA
He's dead.
BOURNE -- the gun -- right to Jarda's face --
BOURNE
Try again.
JARDA
Shot dead in Paris.
Dead the night you
walked out.
BOURNE/PHONE
Then who runs Treadstone?
JARDA
Nobody. They shut it down. We're the
last two. It's over...
(not finishing because--)
-- he's falling! -- landing hard -- BOURNE just kicked the
chair out from under him --
48.
BOURNE
You're lying. If it's over, why are they
after me?
JARDA
I don't know.
BOURNE
Who sent you to Greece?
JARDA
A voice. A voice from the States.
Someone new.
BOURNE
Pamela Landy?
JARDA
I don't know who that is.
BOURNE
What's going on in Berlin?
JARDA
I don't know! Why would I lie?
Silence.
BOURNE pulls back.
Unsure.
JARDA makes it to his feet.

BOURNE doesn't know.

what do you
talk about? I mean, for us.
The work. Y
ou can't tell them who you

BOURNE
I did.
JARDA hesitates. It's really like Bourne just told him how
much he loved her.
JARDA
I thought you were here to kill me.
49.
Something in the way he said it.
Plus Jarda just glanced
at his watch.
BOURNE
What did you do?
JARDA shrugs, almost embarrassed. BOURNE looks across to
the alarm pad Jarda hit on the way in. Voltage -- like a
switch.
BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)
You called it in?
JARDA
I'm sorry.

Everyone rushing to look.
Excited, except --
ZORN
Forget it.
They lost him.
TEDDY

They've got a

ZORN
You can't see him? He's not in front of

PAMELA
Okay, how do you want to do it?

BOURNE
I want someone I know to take me in.

PAMELA
Who?
BOURNE
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the

AND NOW WE STAY WITH
PAMELA -- her eyes flicker over to NICKY.
PAMELA
What if we can't find her?
BOURNE/PHONE
It's easy.

Flickering light there.

IRENA -- her key at the door. Domestic disturbance playing

It's dark.
And she's barely through the door when --
IRENA jumps -- chokes back a CRY --
BOURNE is standing there -- propped there actually --
behind her -- gun in hand -- motioning for her to be quiet --
BOURNE
(his shabby Russian)
(Quiet. Silence. Okay?)
IRENA nods. Scared. Gun in hand, BOURNE pushes the door
the last few inches so it's fully closed.
IRENA
(I have no money.
No drugs.
Is that what
you want?)
And now she can really see him. He's a disaster.
Shivering. Bloody. Eyes more hollow than hers are.
BOURNE
Sit.
Can yo
u...
(tryin
g to conjure the
Russi
an--)
(The chair.
Have the chair.)
IRENA
(accented)
I speak English.
BOURNE staring at her.
Nods.
Gestures for her to sit.
BOURNE
Please...
So she does.
And here they are.

BOURNE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Of all the p
eople in the world, you're the
only one I h
ave anything to offer.
(hesit
ating)
That's why I
came here.
IRENA
(she's terrified)
Okay.
He'
s got some
thing bes
ide him. Somet
hing he's
taken off
the
wall. IT
'S THE PH
OTOGRAPH. The
Neski fami

the
one that
was in th

. Mom, Da

arm

Before it
was
abandoned
. Happy.
Smiling. Per
fect.
BOURNE
It's nice.
(a beat)
Does this picture mean anything to you?
*
(no answer)
*
Hmm?
*
IRENA
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
BOURNE
No. It's because you don't know how they
died.
IRENA
(he couldn't understand)
No, I do.
*
A change in BOURNE as he studies her, measures her.
Some
moment of truth is here. IRENA braces, unsure.
BOURNE
I would want
to know.
(beat)
I would want
to know that my mother didn't
kill my fath
er. I would want
to know that
she didn't kill herself.
IRENA
What?
She really looks at him now.
Fear overwhelmed by
curiosity.
BOURNE
I would grow up thinking that they didn't
love me if they just left me like that.
117.
Irena making sure her eyes don't leave his.
They don't.
BOURNE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
It changes things. That knowledge.
Doesn't it?
IRENA
(wary)
Yes...
BOURNE
That's not what happened to your parents.
IRENA
Then what?
BOURNE
I killed them.
Body blows, but he has her attention.
She wipes a tear.
BOURNE (CONT'D)
*
It was my jo
b. My first time. Your
father was s
upposed to be alone. But then
your mother,
she came out of nowhere...
(a lit
tle shrug)
I had to cha
nge my plan.
(beat)
You understa
nd me?
(does
she?)
You don't ha
ve to live like that anymore.
Thinking tha
t.
IRENA
You killed them.
BOURNE nods, that's right.
BOURNE
They loved you.
(beat)
And I killed them.
IRENA
*
How...how can...how can you be here and
*
say this?
*
BOURNE
*
I don't want you to forgive me.
*
She stands suddenly. Stands because if she doesn't she'll
burst into tears. Because she knows if she starts crying
she won't be able to make sense of this.
118.
IRENA
For who?
*
(he doesn't answer)
KILLED FOR WHO?
BOURNE pushes himself to his feet.
A real effort.
BOURNE
It doesn't matter.
Your life is hard
enough.
IRENA
You're a liar.
BOURNE
You know I'm not.
IRENA
YOU'RE A LIAR!
BOURNE
Look at me.
There they are.
Two people standing in a room.
Squared
off.
And now she starts crying.
Really crying.
And he's taking it.
IRENA
I should kill you...if it's true you
should die...I should kill you now!
BOURNE
I can't let you do that either.
*
IRENA
Because you're afraid!
BOURNE
No.
(starting for the door)
Because you don't want to know how it
feels.
She hesitates.
Stunned.
He's leaving.
He's opening the
*
door.
*
BOURNE (CONT'D)
*
I have to go now.
*
IRENA
*
Is this really happening?

BOURNE

(empty)
I'm sorry.
And she sags.

sheets -- SUNSHINE through clean windows and --
PAMELA (OS)
Hello, David.

There she is.
Standing at the foot of his bed.
BOURNE
Where am I?
PAMELA
Ramstein Air
Base, Germany.

Before the w
all fell you would have woken
up in a Russ

He looks around -- tries to move -- hammered by pain.
BOURNE
Oh, shit...
PAMELA
Careful...
*
120.
Long moment.
He's taking it in.
Trying to.
BOURNE
Why am I alive?
PAMELA
Are you disappointed?
They study each other a beat.
BOURNE
I know who you are.
PAMELA nods.
Very calm here.
No sudden movements.
PAMELA
Thank you for your gift.
I'm sorry about Marie.

BOURNE
*
What's that?
*
PAMELA
*
Do you think you can read?
Are you well
*
enough?
*
She has a folder.
A PHOTOGRAPH -- Bourne's face -- stapled
to the cover.
PAMELA (CONT'D)
*
It's all in here. Treadstone.
A summary
of your life. All of it.
He waves it off.
BOURNE
Don't need it. I remember everything.
PAMELA
(smiles again)
Sounds like a threat.
BOURNE
You didn't answer my question.
PAMELA
Why you're a
live?
(beat)
You're alive
because you're special.
Because she
kept you alive.
(she s
miles)
Because we w
ant you back on our side.
BOURNE silent.
But hearing it.
PAMELA leaves the file.
121.
PAMELA (cont'd) (CONT'D)
Take a look at it. We'll talk later.
BOURNE watching her back away.
As she exits into --

Long, sterile hallway. CRONIN and NICKY standing there
with an AIR FORCE SENTRY assigned to guard the room.
CRONIN and NICKY trying to play it cool, but now, as they
get some distance down the hallway --
PAMELA

(to the sentry)
*
Let's give him half an hour.
*
NICKY
(quietly)
So?
PAMELA
Felt promising. It's a start.

A chill in the air. Both of them going quiet because
there's A NURSE carrying a tray of food. She's coming
toward us. They're walking away.
THE CAMERA
Staying with THE NURSE now.
Coming up the hall.
THE SENTRY smiles -- opens the door and she enters --
