Open on a GEIGER COUNTER scanning over a rocky terrain.
A SAND STORM blows over the landscape. We are lost somewhere
in the middle of the New Mexico desert.
According to the instrument, the area contains high levels of
radiation...
THREE MEN WEARING FULL ANTI-RADIATION SUITS have left their
jeep behind to collect samples of contaminated rocks.
Not at all worried or bothered by the dust storm or high
winds, they walk towards the hills.
The man holding the counter stops in his tracks -
MAN 1
(loudly through the
STORM)
ALRIGHT, GUESS.
MAN 2
I'D SAY 43.9?
MAN 1
IT'S OVER 124.5!
MAN 2
IT'S GOT TO BE OFF.
(WALKING AWAY)
THAT'S THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE
FALLOUT IN CHERNOBYL...
- MAN 3
(following his colleague)
YEAH. PROBABLY NEEDS SOME
ADJUSTMENT.
MAN 2
...CAN'T TRUST THE DIGITAL ONES...
MAN 1
(STANDING STILL)
No...It's something else... It's
like the radioactivity is moving
around us.
The numbers on the dial continue to fluctuate. Where is this
intensity coming from?
(CONTINUED)

He turns around, seeing nothing but sand and rock through his
mask.
Suddenly, for no apparent reason, THE GEIGER COUNTER GETS
LOUDER AS THE NUMBERS SKYROCKET.
In confusion, he taps on the instrument attempting to
stabilize it, but the radioactivity continues to climb...
He looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm - still
nothing in sight.
He sighs. His colleague is probably right, the Geiger counter
simply needs an adjustment...
He turns it off when A MAN COVERED WITH BLOOD, HALF NAKED,
comes out of nowhere and jumps at his face-
MAN
HELP ME... HELP ME, PLEASE HELP ME!
Scared to death, the scientist pushes him away and backs off.
The man covered by blood falls on the ground and starts
crying, begging for help. The scientist doesn't have time to
REACT-
THE RUSTY POINT OF A PICKAXE COMES THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS
MASK AND OUT OF HIS FOREHEAD!
Terrified, the man covered with blood watches the scientist's
dead body-fall to the ground revealing, for a quick second, A
DARK SHAPE FLASHING IN THE SUN.
CUT TO:
In the distance, the other scientists continue their work,
oblivious to the attack. Kneeling behind a rock, they make a
DISCOVERY-
MAN 2
What the hell is it?
With his hand, one of the scientists removes the dust around
some SKELETAL REMAINS.
MAN 3
They look human...
The strange shape of the bones and skull makes it impossible
to tell whether they are human or animal.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)
A SHADOW appears above them-
MAN 2
(without turning around)
Look what we found. Have you...
THE PICKAXE SWINGS THROUGH HIS BACK.
IMPALED LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT, HIS BODY IS SWEPT INTO THE AIR
ONLY TO BE SLAMMED AGAINST THE ROCKS...
Blood splatters on the third man, who steps back suffocating
with fear behind his mask.
The shadowy figure continues the assault on Man 2, finishing
him off. Powerless to stop'the massacre, the last scientist
runs away in a panic.
At the top of the hill, he appears, out of breath. He doesn't
have time to climb the rocks as he is pulled down, screaming
in his mask.
CUT TO:
The scientists' Jeep takes off dragging behind it the three
bodies in their radiation suits and the dead body of the
other man...

A thick, juicy steak lands on a hot skillet.
WE ARE IN A 1950'S COMMERCIAL FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY-
While preparing dinner, the perfect housewife presents the
kitchen of tomorrow by praising all the benefits of nuclear
energy.
She is joined by her husband, their children, and their dog.
The entire family sits at the table with big smiles.
The frame freezes on this naive image of prosperity and well
being. A slogan appears:
"NUCLEAR ENERGY, TRY IT...WE DID!"
CLASSIFIED STOCK FOOTAGE replaces the commercial-
These new images are of nuclear tests performed by the US
Army in the New Mexico desert during the same period-

Old mining towns are evacuated by soldiers. Their inhabitants
are rounded up like cattle and loaded into trucks.
Somewhere else, prefabricated towns filled with test dummies
are eradicated by atmospheric explosions...
Caged animals used for experiments are carbonized by nuclear
waves.
Scientists study the evolution of certain radiated species...
In a split second, gigantic craters are formed in the middle
of the desert.
Explosions destroy everything in their path leaving behind
only a giant nuclear mushroom, beautiful and terrifying...
FADE TO BLACK.
SUPER: NEW MEXICO - TODAY
The sharp outline of the hills appears with the first morning
light.
The sun begins to rise revealing-
A long deserted horizon stretching out endlessly.
Nothing lives in this and wilderness.
A road curves through the desert terrain.
On the side of the road, at the bottom of a hill, a gas
station has survived years of wind and dust.
Around the main building, a tool shed, three gas pumps, a
dilapidated well, a water tower, and gutted carcasses of cars
from the 1950's accentuate the desolate feeling which
prevails in this place.
A sign reads "LAST STOP FOR 200 MILES".
A few tumbleweeds roll across the road.
A 1988 AIRSTREAM TRAILER HOME hitched to A CHEVROLET SUV is
parked in front of the gas station.
BIG BOB CARTER, an imposing man in his late fifties, stands
outside the vehicle still honking the horn.
The trailer home and SUV with the AMERICAN FLAG waving on the
side, completes the image - Big Bob is an obvious cliche of
the middle class Republican father with a touch of John
Wayne.
BIG BOB
where the hell is everybody? I'm

Nothing to see in the desert.
Big Bob glares at the old man who fills up the tank while
still chewing on his cigar.
BIG BOB
You know, it's illegal to smoke
around a gas station.
The old man bursts out in laughter revealing rotten teeth.
Behind the gas station, Brenda plays with AN ALBINO PIGLET
tied to a rope.
BRENDA
Bobby, come look at this.
Bobby joins her.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
(holding the animal)
Oh my god! Poor thing.
BOBBY
You two make a perfect pair.
Bobby turns to a rusty car and unzips to urinate.
BRENDA
Don't pee there...
BOBBY
Why not?
BRENDA
(pointing to a small
WOODEN OUTHOUSE)
Hello?
BOBBY
God, what do you care?
Bobby re-zips and heads towards the small wooden outhouse
while Brenda plays with the baby pig.
BRENDA
Piggy, piggy, piggy...
SOMEONE OBSERVES HER FROM THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE.

In front of the gas station, Lynn leans on the car giving
Catherine a bottle.
Big Bob opens the hood while the old man continues to fill
the tank.
At the same time, Doug comes out of the trailer holding his
cell phone.
DOUG
(to the old man)
Excuse me sir, do you have a phone
I can use? I can't get a signal
around here and...
Big Bob interrupts.
BIG BOB
Give. the phone a rest, Bukowski!
DOUG
Sorry Bob, "duty calls"...
LYNN
Honey, you haven't put that phone
down since we left.
DOUG
This is why I don't go on vacation.
They're lost without me.
BIG BOB
Stop being at everyone's beck and
call, Bukowski. You're the boss,
remember?
ETHEL
.I'm sure all that important
business can wait till next week.
Doug gives up. He kisses Lynn and takes the baby from her.
LYNN
(TO DOUG)
Are you wearing sunblock? The sun's
so strong.

Rays of light pass through the wooden planks.
The outhouse is so dirty that Bobby is forced to hold his
breath...
An EYE peeks between the wooden planks!
BOBBY JUMPS-
BOBBY
What the hell Brenda!
The eye goes away...
He re-zips looking outside. Nobody.
When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Freak.
She looks at him slightly confused...

Doug sits on the porch giving the baby her bottle.
The old gas station attendant checks the oil and the water.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT
This is the only southbound road
that goes to 1-88. From there you
can take the 231 West to
California. But you'll never make

As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns-
KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK
He leans over and catches Bobby and Brenda in the distance,
playing with the well. Brenda is about to drink from her
hands.
OLD GAS ATTENDANT

DON'T DRINK THAT WATER, MISS. IT
AIN'T NO GOOD.

She'll get sick.

There is another room behind the counter, and the beaded
curtain which separates the two rooms is still moving.

Beauty? Come on, sweetie...
No answer.
Cautiously, Lynn moves through the store to the beaded
curtains. Above the cash register, an old sepia photograph of
a miner stares at her.
LYNN (CONT'D)
Beauty?
Lynn goes into the other room.
In the darkness, among the old empty bottles, she finds
Beauty standing with her front legs on a window sill and
barking to the backyard.
Lynn looks outside- Nobody. Only the desert and hills.
Inside the room, THE HALF OPEN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG laying
alone on the table awakens her curiosity.
As she goes to inspect it, she hears the SUV starting and
Doug calling out-
DOUG (O.S.)
Honey!? We're leaving...
Lynn grabs the dog by the collar.
LYNN
(NOT CONVINCED)
Come on, Beauty. There's nothing
here...
She turns around and runs into-
THE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT, STARING AT HER.

The old man lets her pass with the dog, watching her WITH
SUSPICION- Has she seen the contents of the bag?
Through the gas station window, we see Lynn leaving with the
dog.
Outside, next to the rusty abandoned cars, THE PIGLET HAS
DISAPPEARED. Only the rope remains.
A MURMUR IS HEARD AS A SHADOW PASSES SLYLY ON THE FLOOR.
Lynn puts the dog in the trailer where Doug and Bobby are.
She enters the SUV. Behind the wheel, Big Bob turns around
one last time before driving off-
BIG BOB
Let's go!
KNOCK KNOCK The old man knocks on the window. Big Bob opens-
OLD GAS ATTENDANT
(SLIGHTLY MOCKING)
Isn't it illegal to have people in
a trailer while you're driving, "my

ETHEL
He's right, Bob.

OLD GAS ATTENDANT
You know, it's not on the map, but
if you take a right at the road a
couple miles from here, it'll lead
you through the hills. Probably
save you three or four hours.
BIG BOB
Thanks for the tip.
CUT TO:
The trailer drives off in the distance leaving the attendant
in a cloud of dust.
The old man looks to the hills, taking a deep breath...
THE WIND BLOWS OVER THE ROCKY HILLS WHILE WE MOVE TOWARDS THE
ENTRANCE OF THE OLD ABANDONED MINE.
The camera passes through the wooden planks blocking the
entrance and moves into the depths. DARKNESS.
FADE IN:
POV through binoculars from the hilltops.
The binoculars pan across the deserted terrain before
stopping on the Carter vehicle, a tiny dot at the end of the
road. The car and trailer approach.
Off screen, we hear ANIMALISTIC BREATHING behind the
binoculars.
The SUV turns off the main road onto a dirt trail. We see
Brenda lifting the gate and allowing the vehicles to access
the path, unaware of the danger lurking about.
Brenda gets back in the SUV. It pulls the trailer on the dirt
road towards the hills.

Just got on the road... A Chevy and

In the distance, A LIZARD moves through some rocks before
heading across the road unconcerned by the approaching car.
BRENDA (O.S.)
Dad, you shouldn't have listened to
that guy. We're lost.
BIG BOB (O.S.)
Look how beautiful it is here
girls... The hills, the colors...
It's amazing. Imagine the first
people who crossed this desert.
They had no idea where they were
going.
BRENDA
Neither do we, Dad.
On the road, the Lizard continues carving a dusty path.
The lizard has almost crossed the road when-
SHLING!- RAZOR SHARP METAL SPIRES come out of the ground
slicing the lizard in two.
A trap has been set: a long chain of retractable spikes have
emerged across the road.
A few seconds later, the SW drives over them at full speed.
INSTANTLY, THE TIRES EXPLODE.
Big Bob loses control of the vehicle.
The car rolls on the rims causing the trailer to almost flip
over.
Inside, Doug loses his grip and is thrown against the side of
the trailer.
On the road, the spikes retract, disappearing into the
ground.

CRASHING AGAINST SOME ROCKS.
Silence.
The chain of spikes slithers away in the dust like a snake.

Lynn jumps out of the car and runs to the trailer.
LYNN
Doug? Bobby? Are you alright?
Bobby opens the door releasing the barking dogs.
BOBBY
Don't worry, we're fine.
DOUG
(STILL SHAKEN)
What the hell happened?! Where's
Catherine?
LYNN
She's fine. Mom has her.
DOUG
I knew this wasn't gonna be safe

LYNN
The heat must have caused a blow
out.
DOUG
Are you all right?
LYNN
I think so... Just a little shaken
up.
Bobby walks around the car evaluating the damage-
The SUV tires are shredded - the rims buried into the ground.

On the other side of the trailer, Brenda has gotten out and
regained her senses. She takes a few steps, taking in the
land surrounding them...
The lunar terrain of sand and rocks extends beyond the
horizon. In the distance, only the jagged hills are cut out
against the sky. Something OMINOUS AND INDESCRIBABLE lives in
this place...
Behind the trailer, Doug walks off with his cell phone.
DOUG
97% nationwide coverage, and we
have to find ourselves in that
3%...
He searches desperately for a signal, extending his arm
forward. Lynn grabs him tenderly by the waist.
DOUG (CONT'D)

HORIZON)
Your father wanted to see the
desert...
LYNN
Doug...
DOUG
I hope he's enjoying himself.
On his knees, by the SUV tires, Big Bob inspects under the
vehicle... Not only are the tires flattened, but the front
axel has buckled from hitting the rocks.
BIG BOB

How am I supposed to drive with you
talking my ear off? I'm pulling a
trailer on a dirt road and it's 200
degrees out here!
Behind him, Ethel walks with the baby who has stopped crying.

DOUG
I already tried. I'm not getting a
signal.
ETHEL
Can we use the C/B?
BIG BOB
That old thing? Give it a try, but
this is mining country. Whatever
metal is left in those hills will
probably scramble the signal...
DOUG
What are we going to do?
Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his
hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car. After a long
DRINK-
BIG BOB
We're going to walk, that's what...
DOUG
Walk?! But we're miles from
ANYWHERE-
BIG BOB

So we wait here for someone to

A hundred yards away, Bobby has come to retrieve the dogs.
Beauty and Beast have stopped below a boulder extending

Big Bob reaches into the glove compartment pulling out a 9mm
and an extra clip. He hands it to his son.

Bobby grabs the firearm pointing it to the desert.
Big Bob grabs another gun from the car, A 44 CHROME PLATED
MAGNUM.

Obviously, the two men disagree.
Behind the trailer, Brenda sits on a lounge chair in her bra
revealing a sexy body. She applies suntan lotion ready to

silent desert looking like Paris Hilton.
Lynn exits the trailer and joins her.

Without turning around, Lynn gives her sister the finger.
Brenda smiles with satisfaction.
Outside, Doug and Big Bob look at the road map laid out on
the ground.

Ahead, the rocky horizon shows no indication of a definite
path.
He spots Beauty climbing between some rocks and continues his
chase.
BOBBY

At the bottom of the hill, the rocks are too jagged for him

BEAUTY? BEAUTY?
Nothing. Only sharp rocks stand before him.
SUDDENLY, A HIGH PITCHED HOWLING SOUND TEARS THROUGH THE
SILENCE AND ECHOES IN THE VALLEY.
Bobby freezes.
No doubt about it - Beauty found what she was looking for,
and it was much stronger...
In the distance, Bobby hears his mother calling.
A few feet from the trailer-
ETHEL
BOB-BY?! BOB-BY!?
Overcome with worry, she turns to her two daughters.

36 CONTINUED: 36
ETHEL (CONT'D)
You think he can hear me?
LYNN
I don't know, Mom.
ETHEL
She couldn't have gone that far.
Brenda notices the revolver on the table. Bobby is unarmed.
ETHEL (CONT'D)
(back to the hills)
BOB-BY?!
Back on a threatening mound of rocks.
Bobby must decide-
Return to his family waiting by the trailer or continue his
search for Beauty?
Bobby hesitates, then gathers his courage and decides to
confront the hills.
Jagged rock after jagged rock, Bobby slowly climbs towards
the summit.
He appears between two big stones reaching an intermediate
zone before the top-
A type of NATURAL LABYRINTH formed in the rocks by years of
erosion.
BOBBY
Beauty? Beauty?
Bobby moves cautiously.
He picks up a big stone for protection-
A dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner.
A SHADOW PASSES BEHIND HIM.. Bobby doesn't notice.
Anaaaaaau - A swift sound of breathing breaks the silence.
Bobby spins around, ready to strike.
(CONTINUED)
38.
38 CONTINUED: 38
No one. Just the labyrinth formed in the mountain.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Beauty?
Bobby is ready to give up when something attracts his
ATTENTION-
A THIN SHADOW ON THE GROUND. Someone or something is hiding
behind a rock.
Bobby freezes. He stares at the shadow. Who will make the
first move?
He makes the decision, creeping towards the shadow. Squeezing
the stone, he lifts his hand to strike but stops when he
DISCOVERS-
A YOUNG GIRL, ABOUT 14, WEARING HIS STOLEN SWEATSHIRT. She is
about five feet tall and frail.
The hood covers her head, partly hiding her face. She is
rather pretty, even with her ABNORMALLY LARGE EYES...
She trembles, frightened and intrigued by Bobby. What is this
girl doing in a place like this?
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Don't... Don't be scared. I won't
hurt you... What are you doing
here?
The girl keeps silent. Bobby drops the stone to the ground
but the young girl remains suspicious.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
So you're the one who took my
sweatshirt? Where did you find it?
The young girl smiles shyly. The ice is broken.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
What's your name?
The young girl hesitates and murmurs in a frail voice.
YOUNG GIRL
Ru... Ruby... Ruby...
(CONTINUED)
39.
38 CONTINUED: (2) 38
BOBBY
What are you doing here Ruby? Where
are your parents? My family needs
help. We had an accident.
Ruby repeats her name mechanically as if she doesn't
understand the questions.
RUBY
(in a low voice)
Ru... Ruby... Ruby...
Bobby gets closer.
BOBBY
I heard you, Ruby... Are you here
alone?
Ruby won't answer.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Ruby... I'm looking for my dog...
Do you understand? My dog... her
name is Beauty... She's a German
Shepherd, about this high...
RUBY
Beauty...
BOBBY
That's right, have you seen her?
RUBY
Ruby.. _Ruby is Beauty...
The last sentence makes her laugh. A STRANGE AGONIZING
LAUGHTER.
BOBBY
Have you seen her?
Ruby looks down. She knows something.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Look at me, Ruby... Look at me...
Where did you see my dog?
Ruby keeps looking to the ground. Bobby reaches under her
chin to raise her head.
Instinctively, Ruby SCREAMS as she backs off, lifting her
hands to protect herself.
(CONTINUED)
40.
38 CONTINUED: (3) 38
HER HANDS LOOK LIKE CLAWS. DEFORMED AND MISSING FINGERS, THEY
ARE NO LONGER HUMAN.
Frightened, Bobby takes a step back. The girl murmurs softly.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
What? I can't understand. What are
you saying?
He comes closer trying to make eye contact as she continues
to murmur the same thing. She too is terrified-
RUBY
(SOFTLY)
The hills... The hills have
eyes...The hills have eyes...The
hills have eyes...
Behind him, a small rock slide grabs his attention. He turns
his head. When he turns back to Ruby, she is gone.
BOBBY
Ruby, come back!
Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth.
On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had
been dragged on the rocks.
The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another
set of rocks a few feet away.
Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find...
As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side
Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks.
Before him, on the ground, is Beauty.
Dead. Disemboweled.
Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning
white. He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself
that this nightmare can't be possible at all. Beauty's face
is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And... the
animal is missing its front right leg.
DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand -
ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man
with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old
clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head.
Binoculars hang around his neck.
(CONTINUED)
41.
38 CONTINUED: (4) 38
IT'S GOGGLE.
Goggle has no face, as if it were totally covered with wax.
He has two little holes for nostrils and no ears. His mouth
is like an opened wound sliced in his skin. His eyes are the
only features which give him any human resemblance at all.
Using his hand, Goggle devours something ferociously-
BEAUTY'S LEG!
Terrified, Bobby runs away.
Goggle laughs from his rock.
Bobby jumps down the hill.
From the summit, Goggle continues feasting. A few yards away,
Ruby's slender silhouette slides between the rocks. Goggle
stops eating, sees Ruby, and throws her the remains. Ruby
looks at the half-eaten leg in disgust, and pushes it away.
GOGGLE (O.S.)
(rough and deep)
What's the matter Ruby.. .You don't
like dog anymore?
Moving at top speed, Bobby descends from the hills,
occasionally glancing behind him.
He jumps from one rock to the next. Anything to get out of
this hellhole.
He turns around one too many times and fails to see the sharp
precipice ahead. He tries to stop, but it's too late.
Bobby slides down a few feet before grabbing hold of a
protruding rock. The rock tears his skin.
Bobby tries to climb back up, losing his grip. He falls.
His head hits the bottom. He loses consciousness.
Behind him a RATTLESNAKE slithers rattling its tail.
The snake zips its tongue around his face when -
A WOODEN STICK WITH FORKED END, TRAPS THE SNARE'S HEAD TO THE
GROUND SAVING BOBBY FROM A CERTAIN BITE.

39 CONTINUED: 39
With the hood of the sweatshirt still over her head, RUBY
WATCHES THE WOUNDED BOY TENDERLY with her big, abnormal eyes.
CUT TO:
Close on THE RED SUN on the horizon.
We hear Doug, singing "California Dreaming" a capella.
DOUG
"...All the leaves are brown and the
sky is gray. I've been for a walk
on a winter's day. I'd be safe and
warm if I was in L.A... California
dreamin..."
After hours of walking down this road, his face shows signs
of fatigue.
DOUG (CONT'D)
I was in LA._ California
Dreamin..."
The lyrics resonate throughout the desert. Suddenly, he stops
singing.
DOUG (CONT'D)
(TO HIMSELF)
What the hell?!
IN FRONT OF HIM, ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD, THE ROAD ENDS-
A mound of earth blocks the road like a wall, extending
hundreds of yards on either side.
Confused, Doug approaches the wall and starts climbing.
Reaching the top, he takes off his sun clips from his glasses
and tries to grasp what's on the other side-
A HUGE ATOMIC CRATER, three hundred yards in. diameter.
THE CRATER HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A GRAVEYARD FOR CARS, TRUCKS,
TRAILER HOMES, MOTORCYCLES...
Doug climbs down and wanders between the rusted vehicles.
Doug lights a cigarette before continuing his inspection.
(CONTINUED)
43.
40 CONTINUED: 40
In the reflection of a shattered rear view mirror, we see him
approaching another car.
Dust completely covers the windows. Doug wipes one down to
LOOK INSIDE-
He notices a baby seat still strapped to the back.
The cars all seem to be in good condition, as if they were
simply pushed into the crater.
He leans down towards another car-
Barbed wire is rolled around the flattened tires...
As Doug looks around in confusion, trying to figure out what
this place might be, THE CAMERA CRANES UP TO A WIDE AERIAL
SHOT - revealing five or six others craters.
It's getting colder.
Lynn warms her hands at a fire in front of the trailer.
A few feet away, Brenda collects firewood while calling out
her brother's name...
BRENDA
BOBBY! BOB-BY!
Inside the camper, Ethel watches the sun set in the horizon.
She cradles the baby in her arms.
Brenda joins Lynn and throws some firewood into the flames.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
(looking at the hills)
We should've gone looking for him
when it was still light out. I'm
nervous.
LYNN
Keep it together Brenda, Mom is
already worried enough... The fire
will help Bobby find his way back.
BRENDA
What if he doesn't come back? Maybe
he's hurt. Maybe there was an
accident...

LYNN
He and Beauty will find their way
back together.
Lynn hugs her sister.
LYNN (CONT'D)
I never thought it could be so cold
in the desert...
BRENDA
Bobby was only wearing a t-shirt
when he left.
LYNN
I know...
Clouds pass, revealing an almost full moon. Wind blows around
the dark gas station.
Between the broken-down cars, we see Big Bob approaching on
the road.
A rusty tea pot sits on a pile of trash and whistles in the
wind. By placing his hand on the spout, Big Bob stops the
whistling and silence returns.
Whistling. Silence. Whistling.
Big Bob walks to the porch.
BIG BOB
HELLO! ANYONE HERE?!
No answer. He knocks on the door.
BIG BOB (CONT'D)
It's Bob Carter, I got some gas
from you a couple of hours ago.
Still nothing. Big Bob draws his gun and opens the door when-
SILENCE.
From the other side of the house, the whistling has stopped.
BIG BOB (CONT'D)
Anybody there? Answer me!
After a few seconds, the whistling returns.
(CONTINUED)
45.
42 CONTINUED: 42
Big Bob shrugs it off and enters.
BIG BOB'S FACE SLAMS REPEATEDLY INTO THE WINDSHIELD!
The truck shakes as Big Bob is attacked inside. Blood
splatters on the windows.
Bloodied and screaming, Big Bob is dragged out of the car in
the dirt to the entrance of the old mine behind the gas
station. Big Bob disappears inside. The night is once again
calm and silent.
FADE TO BLACK.
Lynn's distress call is heard from the trailer isolated in
the middle of the desert.
Still tied to the trailer, Beast growls and pulls on his
chain.
Lynn raises the collar of her jacket to protect herself from
the wind and moves closer to the fire.
LYNN
Brenda?
No answer.
LYNN (CONT'D)
(LOUDER)
BRENDA?!
In the distance, we see Brenda looking for her brother.
BRENDA
BOBBY? BOBBY?
With a flashlight in one hand, the gun in the other, and a
blanket over her shoulders, Brenda moves through the night.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
BOBBY? BOB-BY?
She hears her older sister calling.
LYNN (O.S.)
Brenda? Brenda?
BRENDA
I'm here! I'll be back in a minute.
The flashlight partially lights the desert as she disappears
into the night.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
BOBBY? BOB-BY?
We fly over the hills before stopping over Bobby's
unconscious body laid out between two rocks.
Ruby is still at his side, observing him silently.
She hears Brenda's calls and runs away.
(CONTINUED)
52.
53 CONTINUED: 53
Bobby slowly opens an eye, regaining his senses. Blood has
coagulated on his face. He turns his head in the direction of
his sister's voice, realizing that it's night. How long has
he been unconscious?
CUT TO:
The sky is so clear that you can see the milky way above the
Carters' trailer home.
Beast strains on his chain, a low growl of rage coming from
his chest.
At the top of the hill, Beast has found what's left of
Beauty's mutilated body and whines as he licks her face.
CUT TO:
From outside we see Doug and Lynn finishing dinner while
Brenda clears the table.
Doug holds Catherine on his knees.
Outside, Bobby stands guard with the gun. His mother comes
out.
ETHEL
Looks like we're camping out
tonight. How's your head?
Bobby doesn't answer.
ETHEL (CONT'D)
Bobby? What's going on?
A beat.
BOBBY
Nothing, Mom.
ETHEL
Are you sure?
BOBBY
I'll feel a lot better when dad
gets back.
ETHEL
Me too, honey. Come inside. You've
already spent enough time in the
cold for one day, don't you think?
(CONTINUED)
56.
58 CONTINUED: 58
Bobby agrees to follow his mother, abandoning the fire.
The flames dance with the desert wind in the night.
In between some bushes, we see the Carter trailer home
isolated in the desert under the starlit sky. Backlit in the
window, Brenda dances...
Next to the trailer home, the SUV-
At the same time A HAND opens the gas tank and unscrews the
cover.
(CONTINUED)
59.
62 CONTINUED: 62
In total silence, the hand slips a rubber hose into the tank
and starts siphoning gas. We follow the hose up to the
monstrous mouth of-
PLUTO - The deformed bald giant with a child's face. But a
child with a thick, primal cruelty snapping in his
asymmetrical, protruding eyes.
Silently, Pluto siphons some of the Carter's gas into a gas
can.
Lynn's hand presses against the window, as she and her
husband continue, unaware.
Pluto laughs stupidly, excited by the situation. His large
smile reveals POINTY SHARK-LIKE TEETH.
Once the gas can is full, he waves at somebody hidden in the
dark.
Bobby moves into the night. Beast is still barking somewhere
in the dark.
As he passes the SUV, he overhears the moaning and heavy
breathing coming from inside.
His flashlight moves over the desert terrain and the
occasional bush. He calls out to his dog, trying not to wake
anyone.
(CONTINUED)
60.
64 CONTINUED: 64
BOBBY
Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me!
Come on now.
Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking.
HIS FLASHLIGHT PASSES QUICKLY OVER A SHAPE HIDING IN THE
BUSHES!
Bobby shines the light on the bush and approaches-
Nothing. It must have been his imagination.
The barking becomes a ferocious growl.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Beast? Beast? Its me. Come on...
All of a sudden the growling becomes a "mooing" cow.
Then a goat. Then a chicken.
Terrified, Bobby turns around and runs back toward the SUV.
Panting and panicked, Bobby knocks on the SUV's tailgate
window, interrupting Lynn and Doug.
BOBBY
Doug! Doug!
Caught red-handed, Lynn dresses and Doug pulls up his pants.
(CONTINUED)
61.
66 CONTINUED: 66
DOUG
Damanit! What is it now?
LYNN
(through the window)
What do you want, Bobby?
BOBBY
Come on, open up!
Lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look.
LYNN
This had better be important.
Bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden. He regains his
calm before talking.
BOBBY
Something's going on around here.
We're not alone.
Exasperated, Lynn takes a deep breath, not taking him
seriously.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
I know this sounds weird, but there
are people living in those hills.
LYNN
Bobby... We're in the middle of
nowhere. Believe me, no one could
survive out here!
BOBBY
I saw them. And Beauty...
DOUG
Beauty what?
BOBBY
They cut out her insides.
LYNN
What are you talking about?
BOBBY
Her guts were all over the place...
He struggles to talk.

66 CONTINUED: (2) 66
BOBBY (CONT'D)
I...I didn't want to scare you so I
didn't say anything, but
something's going on... You even
said you heard some breathing on
the radio didn't you?
Lynn nods.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
We're not alone, I'm telling you...
Doug exits the car. Obviously, Bobby is not kidding.
DOUG
Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check
it out together. Lynn, stay right
here.
AT THAT MOMENT, an explosion takes place a few hundred yards
away from the trailer.
The flames climb into the air lighting the surrounding rocky
desert.
SOMEONE SCREAMS. Doug and Bobby turn around.
IT'S BIG BOB!
He has been crucified to a Joshua tree and transformed into a
HUMAN TORCH...
The explosion and the screaming has awakened Ethel who comes
out of the trailer in her nightgown. Recognizing his screams,
she runs to her burning husband.
ETHEL
IT'S BOB! IT'S BOB!
(CONTINUED)
63.
68 CONTINUED: 68
Doug tries to hold her back, but she is determined to get to
him.
Doug runs out leaving the door wide open.
Someone jumps from the roof and, on all fours, lands in front
of the door. He stands and, for the first time, we see the
face of -
LIZARD - Pluto's cousin.
Lizard is as thin as Pluto is imposing. Extremely pale, his
face is disfigured by A CLEFT LIP WHICH EXPOSES HIS DEFORMED
JAW. A SAVAGE WITH NO SENSE OF PITY, LIZARD IS, AFTER PAPA
JUPITER, THE MOST VIOLENT INHABITANT OF THE HILLS.
Lizard has Big Bob's Magnum. He enters the trailer and closes
the door behind him.
Big Bob screams as the flames devour his naked flesh.
His fingers tighten. His bloodied face distorts with pain.
Even his eyes are burnt. Considering the condition of his
body, it's a miracle he's still alive...
Doug arrives with the extinguisher and begins putting out the
fire under Ethel's horrified, watchful eye.
Brenda's muted screams are heard from inside the trailer.
The flames have been replaced by white smoke.
Doug unties Big Bob. His body falls motionless to the ground.
COMPLETELY CARBONIZED, HE HAS STOPPED BREATHING.
Smoke comes out of his mouth.
Doug uses the blanket to extinguish the last flames.
Behind Doug, Ethel looks at her husband refusing to accept
the truth.
ETHEL
No..No.. It's not possible. That's
not Bob. That's not my Bob.
She grabs Doug by his shirt trying to convince him.
ETHEL (CONT'D)
Doug.. It's not him. Tell me it's
not him. It's not my Bob!
The poor woman has lost her mind. Ethel erupts in laughter
pointing to her dead husband.
ETHEL (CONT'D)
(HYSTERICALLY)
That is not my Bob! That is not my
Bob! That's not him!
Lynn and Bobby are paralyzed. Doug turns to his wife.
DOUG
Take your mother away from here!
With her eyes fixed on her father, Lynn walks her mother
away.
In Bobby's eyes, sadness has been replaced by hatred. Full of
rage, the youngster grabs the gun and walks away.
(CONTINUED)
66.
74 CONTINUED: 74
DOUG (CONT'D)
Where are you going? Bobby?
BOBBY
I'm gonna take care of the
motherfuckers!
DOUG
Come back here, Bobby!
Bobby disappears into the night.
Doug covers Big Bob's face with a blanket.
Returning to the trailer, Lynn struggles to restrain Ethel.
Ethel finally realizes it's too late for her husband and
collapses into her daughter's arms.
Just then, a muffled scream from Brenda pierces the night.
LYNN
Oh my god!
Lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone.
From far away, Bobby hears the gunshot. He quickly turns
around to help his family.
68.
Alarmed by the gunfire, Doug gets up and looks at the trailer
in the distance. He doesn't know what to do.
Bobby appears behind him-
BOBBY
Come on Doug! They're in the
trailer-!
They both take off running.
Brenda is pulled out by Lizard.
When he sees Bobby and Doug approaching, Lizard changes his
MIND-
HE INSERTS THE BARREL OF HIS GUN INTO BRENDA'S MOUTH...
Brenda is wide eyed. Without hesitating, Lizard pulls the
TRIGGER-
CLICK! - no more bullets.
Lizard drops Brenda.
LIZARD
I'll come back for ya...
Lizard disappears into the night.
Brenda lays on the ground trembling and crying.
Doug arrives at the trailer, while Bobby aims the 9mm at the
assassins.
BANG! BANG! BANG!
It's too late. They're gone.
Bobby runs to his traumatized sister laying on the ground. He
holds her in his arms, trying to calm her down.
Doug approaches the open door. He notices bloody hand prints
along the side of the trailer home- One of the attackers has
been hurt...
At the foot of the burnt tree, Big Bob's body is laid out on
some rocks, the blanket over his face.
A few figures emerge out of the darkness and gather around
the body like a pack of hyenas.
BIG BOB IS DRAGGED AWAY THROUGH THE DUST...
CUT TO:
Backlit by the moon, at the top of the hill, we find Goggle
and his binoculars.
Reflecting in the lenses, we see the carters' trailer glowing
in the night.
A rustling noise attracts his attention.

71.
84 CONTINUED: 84
Before Goggle can turn around, a wild animal jumps at his
face- IT'S BEAST.
The German shepherd tears at Goggle's face and locks deep
into his throat. Goggle tries to fight it off, but the animal
is determined to kill.
Goggle grabs AN OLD RAZOR out of his pocket and tries to cut
the animal.
The dog bites down tightening its grip. BONES CRACK.
He drops the razor. Goggle's derby hat falls between some
rocks.
BEAST AVENGES BEAUTY IN A BLOODFEST!
Someone calls him on the on walkie-talkie-
RADIO (O.S.)
"Goggle? Goggle..."
Goggle will not answer anymore...
The first sign of dawn lights the distant horizon.
The vultures perched on a dead Joshua Tree swivel their heads
around, to see a distant, running FIGURE -
DOUG AND BEAST, moving steadily among the rocks.
Doug and Beast arrive at the old mine's entrance on the side
of the hill. The trail of blood leads inside.
Doug hides behind a rock. Sweating, he catches his breath.
Beast breathes heavily as well. Doug remembers what his wife
always used to say-
DOUG
(to the dog)
I told you to stop smoking.
Doug sets a different frequency on his radio-
DOUG (CONT'D)
(Into the walkie)
Bobby? Bobby? You read me?
BOBBY (O.S.)
Yeah, Doug...
DOUG
I followed the blood, I'm in front
of a mine!

DOUG (CONT'D)
I'm not sure if I'll get a signal
from inside. If you don't hear from
me in a half an hour, you're on
your own.
(A BEAT)
Bobby?
BOBBY
Yeah... Good luck, Doug.
He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight.
DOUG
(TO BEAST)
You ready big guy? I hope you're
not afraid of the dark.
He pets the dog one final time and stands up.
Brenda drags one of the tires from the SUV 30 feet away.
She douses it with lighter fluid and-
Whoosh! - a match sets it on fire creating a thick, black,
smoke signal.
Brenda joins her brother who is busy planting wooden stakes
in a circle fifty meters around the trailer.
BRENDA
Maybe somebody heard our calls..
BOBBY
Nobody's going to find us Brenda,
even with that smoke...Nobody's
coming._.. You heard what Doug
said-We're alone now, just you
and me. Let them come, I'm waiting
for them.
Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole
around each stake. He sets the fishing pole next to the
trailer, rigging to it one of Catherine's TOY SHAKERS-
An improvised alarm system.
At the summit, somebody observes the trailer and the thick
cloud of smoke rising to the air.
CUT TO:
83.
Doug runs down the hills towards the town. Behind him, from
the mouth of the mine, someone observes between the rocks-
it's Ruby.
Doug slows his pace as he enters Main Street. The town is
deserted. No sign of life anywhere. All the houses and cars
are covered with a thick layer of dust.
Taking a closer look, he realizes all the parked cars are
from the 50's.
Uncertain, Doug walks through the ghost town, with Beast at
his side...
No movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an
occasional cloud of dust. Doug walks up to a house and knocks
on the front door.
No one to open the door. Doug wipes one of the windows-
It's too dark inside to see anything. The door is unlocked,
Doug pushes it.
It squeaks open. He hesitates before entering.
Doug quickly crosses Main Street to visit another house.
Stupefied, Doug enters yet another house.
The door remains open as we see another family of dummies
living a perfect little life. A LIFE WHICH STOPPED IN THE
LATE 50'S...
Around the corner of a house, a little girl dummy is sitting
on a swing, her face half broken.
A second later, Doug thinks he hears CHILDREN LAUGHING. He
TURNS AROUND-
Nothing but the wind blowing through the houses.
Doug takes Catherine's bib from his pocket and lets Beast get
its scent.
DOUG
Find her, Beast, find Catherine...
With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight
ahead.
Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog.
On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the
sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-
TEST SITE 3B - MILITARY ZONE - HIGH RADIATION RISK
The scent leads Doug into an alley off the main street.
He sees an old generator on full throttle. A thick smoke
pours from the exhaust.
SOMEONE LIVES HERE!
His daughter could be there...

99 CONTINUED: 99
Doug tries to see into the windows, but they are caked in
filth. He decides to go around when-
A MAN WALKS INTO VIEW WITHOUT SEEING HIM!
Immediately, Doug backs away.
The man drags a cadaver by its feet. Half of the dead body
is missing, having apparently been torn off.
Beast GROWLS.
The man turns around, revealing his horrible face-
A METALLIC BRACE is screwed on four sides of his head helping
him stand straight. ENORMOUS CYSTS DISFIGURE HIM AND COVER
EVERY VISIBLE PART OF HIS BODY. Let's call him "CYST".
Cyst traces back his steps, trying to find what caused the
noise. He holds the gas station attendant's shotgun!
The alley is empty. The generators are still motoring.
All seems normal. Cyst turns back towards main street.
Cyst passes an old'parked car without seeing Doug and the dog
hidden inside.
Doug breathes a sigh of relief. Close call.
Quietly, Doug gets out of the car. He hesitates as to whether
he should bring Beast with him or to leave him in the car.
The dog could be his best weapon but, on the other hand, he
also represents a_bigger risk to be spotted.
DOUG (CONT'D)
(SOFTLY)
You wait here Beast! Come on,
sit!... Good boy. I'm gonna find
Catherine...
The dog is confused and whines through the half-opened
window.
DOUG (CONT'D)
Shhhh... Quiet Beast... Don't move!
I'll be back...
He closes the car door and starts down the alley, lowering
his head.

99 CONTINUED: (2) 99
From inside the car, Beast watches Doug getting further
away...
Doug sneaks along the side of the building towards the front
door.
He hesitates, unsure of what awaits him inside-
The back door to the SUV opens, revealing Bobby and Brenda
carrying Lynn's body inside where Ethel's body has been
moved.
Not far from the car and above the fishing pole, Catherine's
shaker remains still and silent...
Still imprisoned in the car, Beast barks, desperate to find a
way out.
A hundred yards away-
Cyst crosses Main Street toward Big Brain's house still
holding the shotgun.
Through the broken door, Cyst spots Pluto in a pool of blood.
Hatred fills his eyes as he loads the shotgun and prepares to
shoot.

He looks for Doug but sees no one.
Cyst moves in between a few cars, failing to see Doug hiding
behind one of them.
Doug hits the man in his knee with the axe.
HE SEVERS HALF OF HIS RIGHT LEG. Cyst screams in agony.
In one swift move, Doug removes the axe from Cyst's kneecap
swinging it into his back.
Cyst falls on the ground.
The fall pushes the axe further into his back. Cyst reaches
for the shotgun lost in his fall.
Doug steps on his chest and pushes slowly-
Crack - The axe finally hits the spine, killing him
instantly.
Doug picks up the shotgun.
In a panic, Doug runs out of the last house screaming.
DOUG
CATHERINE!
95.
Outside, with the baby in her arms, Ruby runs as fast as she
can.
Desperate, Doug runs through the test town looking for his
daughter.
In an upstairs window, he sees Ruby's mother, THE OBESE
WOMAN, swinging on a rocking chair staring back.
Suddenly, coming from the hills, Doug hears the sound of a
baby crying. In the distance, he spots Ruby running through
the rocks. He runs with the shotgun in hand.
DOUG
Catherine!
Under the fake car, in between the seats, Beast finds a hole
big enough to fit his nose.
The animal forces his way through, scratching at the floor
until he finally fits his body through the hole and out of
the car.
The dog runs down Main Street...
CUT TO:
Back on the trailer-

116 CONTINUED: 116
Sweating, Bobby joins his sister hidden behind the SW. With
the 9mm in hand, staring at the horizon, he is ready to face
the enemy.
Above the fishing pole, Catherine's shaker is still.
Gust of wind blow on the eerily silent plains.
Suddenly, in a flash, the fishing line tightens and THE
SHAKER MOVES AROUND, MAKING NOISE.
Then, quiet returns as if nothing had ever happened.
Brenda is terrified. Maybe someone has crossed their zone of
security.
Bobby Lifts his head and looks a full 360-
NOTHING.
Bobby and Brenda exchange worried glances when-
THE FISHING POLE MOVES, SHAKING CATHERINE'S SHAKER
FRENETICALLY.
The fishing reel quickly unwinds...
This time there is little room for doubt, even if all seems
clear around the camper.
BRENDA
I don't.see anybody... What's
happening?
Bobby and Brenda leave their hiding place. They move, back to
back, cautious...
BRENDA (CONT'D)
answer me, why isn't anyone there?
I'm scared...
BOBBY
(LOW VOICE)
Stay close Brenda.
From inside the SW, we see the two adolescents getting
further away when-
A DARK FIGURE JUMPS IN THE FOREGROUND, IN FRONT OF THE
WINDOW!
(CONTINUED)
97.
116 CONTINUED: (2) 116
It's PAPA JUPITER. His long hair and thick beard cover
everything except his determined and PSYCHOPATHIC EYES.
Bobby and Brenda have arrived at the end of their security
zone...
BRENDA
Look!
Further ahead, on the ground, a tumbleweed is stuck on the
fishing wire, moving it in the wind.
BRENDA (CONT'D)
Let's go back...
Not convinced, Bobby agrees, but his face freezes when he
turns back to see- THE BACK DOOR OF THE SUV, WIDE OPEN.
At a loss, Bobby and Brenda return.
THEIR MOTHER'S BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED!
BRENDA (CONT'D)
(PANICKED)
What happened? What happened Bobby?
Where's mom?
A trail of blood leads from the trailer to somewhere behind
some rocks.
BOBBY
(TO BRENDA)
He's over there. Get the trailer
ready.._
The new "visitor" has brought the nightmare back to life in
Brenda's eyes. She's paralyzed.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Brenda? Come on?
Brenda remains still.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
BRENDA?!
Terrorized, Brenda backs up to the trailer, while her
brother, with a determined look on his face, walks to the
hills.
98.
What Bobby discovers behind the rocks is beyond horrific-
Kneeling next to his mother's corpse, Papa Jupiter devours
her heart, tearing into it with his teeth. FEELING BOBBY'S
PRESENCE, HE TURNS AROUND AND STARES AT THE YOUNG MAN WITH A
SADISTIC SMILE. BLOOD DRIPS DOWN HIS BEARD.
Bobby points his gun at him.
Papa Jupiter stands and, in a fit of rage, charges at Bobby.
Keeping his cool, Bobby fires-
BANG! BANG! BANG! The bullets only slow him down.
CLICK! The gun is empty.
.Outside, Bobby throws the gun and runs to the trailer as fast
as he can. _
Papa Jupiter is right behind him.
He takes a SMALL PICKAXE from his belt and throws it at
Bobby.
THE PICKAXE STICKS INTO THE TRAILER INCHES FROM BOBBY'S FACE!
Behind the trailer, Brenda helps her brother squeeze out of
the back window.
They both run and hide behind a rock.
At the same time, Papa Jupiter stands in front of the trailer
door, relishing the idea that his victims are inside.
He opens the door. The matches strike-
PAPA JUPITER IS ENGULFED IN THE FLAMES.
THE TRAILER HOME EXPLODES!
Protected by the rocks, Bobby and Brenda watch as the
explosion climbs to the sky. They did it...
CUT TO:
With Catherine held tightly in her arms, Ruby runs on the
edge of the mountain.
Seventy yards behind, Lizard gives chase with a limp and the
chain of spikes in tow.
LIZARD
Ruby...Ruby! You come back here
right now. You hear me, you little
bitch?
The road on the edge comes to a dead end.
Ruby is stuck, the only way out is to climb. Without using
her hands, she attempts to ascend. It's close to impossible.
SUDDENLY, LIZARD GRABS HER ANKLE!
She tries to fight him off, but he is too strong.
Ruby kicks him in the jaw enraging him more. He pulls her
down swiftly when-
BEAST APPEARS BEHIND RUBY!
The animal shows his teeth, advancing towards Lizard who
backs off.
(CONTINUED)
100.
127 CONTINUED: 127
Lizard is amused and almost excited with this last
confrontation... Discreetly, he grabs the chain of spikes
while keeping his eyes on the barking German Shepherd.
THE RUSTY, RETRACTABLE SPIKES ARE RELEASED ALONG THE CHAIN!
Beast sees the weapon and leaps towards Lizard.
Too late. The chain strikes the dog in the air, sending him
over the edge.
BEAST WHINES AS HE LANDS ON A PROTRUDING SECTION OF THE
RAVINE A FEW FEET FURTHER DOWN...
Ruby refuses to hand over the baby, holding it tightly to her
chest.
LIZARD (CONT'D)
Give me that baby, Ruby!
With no time to react, Lizard is brutally struck in the face
with the shotgun butt-
DOUG IS BACK!
Taking no chances and screaming like a wild beast, Doug beats
Lizard repeatedly pushing him away from the baby.
With a bloodied face, Lizard can hardly stand.
Doug turns the weapon around and-
BANG! - He shoots Lizard in the chest.
Lizard is thrown back with the force.
Doug reloads still screaming-
BANG! Lizard is hit in the throat and falls.to his knees.
Blood sprays everywhere.
Doug reloads again-
BANG! - hit in the shoulder, Lizard falls back in the dirt.
His face slams into the dust.
Exhausted, Doug walks over to his adversary.
He is dead.
Disfigured with wounds, Doug turns to Ruby, who extends the
baby.
(CONTINUED)
127 CONTINUED: (2)
Doug can barely comprehend it - the nightmare is finally
over!
He. drops the smoking gun and opens his arms to embrace his
baby. He cries tears of joy as he holds Catherine close to
him.
DOUG
My baby ...My little princess... It's
me, it's daddy...
He kisses the baby and hugs her tightly, elated. Ruby is
moved. She smiles when suddenly her face freezes-
LIZARD STANDS FIFTEEN FEET BEHIND, HOLDING THE SHOTGUN!
Trembling, he lifts the weapon towards Doug and the baby.
Instinctively, Ruby moves to stop him.
KA-CHUNK! - Lizard reloads.
His finger squeezes the trigger.
BANG!
At the last second, Ruby jumps on Lizard changing the
direction of the blast.
They both fall off the mountain into the emptiness. Their
bodies plunge a hundred feet down, splattering on the rocks
below.
RUBY HAS SACRIFICED HER OWN LIFE TO SAVE DOUG AND THE BABY.
One of the FAMILY PHOTOS of the carters posing with their
dogs is slowly burning away in the flames.
Pieces of the trailer still burn in the middle of the desert.
Surrounded by debris, Papa Jupiter's body is impaled.on a
darkened metal siding. Still alive but entirely burnt, his
skin is raw and unrecognizable. With every breath, blood
spits from his mouth...
Facing this post atomic creature, Bobby hesitates to take it
out of its misery. Brenda comes to his side-

BRENDA
Come on, Bobby. Let's get out of
here...
Bobby's face has changed. He is no longer the innocent kid of
just a few hours ago. His eyes are now filled with rage and a
determination to survive and succeed no matter what.
Brenda and Bobby walk away from the burning trailer. On the
other side of the smoke, they see-
DOUG WALKING BACK WITH THE BABY, BEAST LIMPING AT HIS SIDE.
Exhausted, wounded, disfigured, but still alive.
From a distance, next to the fiery trailer, we see Doug,
Brenda, and Bobby gathered around the baby. Reunited again.
FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE HILLS, SOMEONE OBSERVES THEM WITH
BINOCULARS.
