A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night.
This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the
mirrored surface of a helmet visor.
A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE
RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,
climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.
He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He
conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the
building's entrance.
A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for
a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.
THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what
looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at
TUXEDO.
SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A
digital readout: "SCANNING..." Then a long SERIAL
NUMBER reads out and the name, "LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,"
along with other personal information below.
THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He
reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious
DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has
a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety
switches and buttons.
The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can
REACH HIM--
A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in
the back. They're gone in an instant.
The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He
starts it and pursues the limousine.
2.
THE MOTORCYCLE pursues the LIMOUSINE along the Potomac,
D. C. LANDMARKS visible in the distance.
FORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The
LIMOUSINE approaches.
THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area,
pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X.
TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open.
TUXEDO
I can find my way back.
ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the
entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he
disappears inside.
THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo
has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch
up with him.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It
won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides
open a crack--
THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED
EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING
BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes.
BOUNCER
This is a private club.
ASSASSIN
I just need to talk to--
THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face.
RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the
door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they
grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting
drenched in the warm downpour.
WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP,
as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him,
TURNS--
TUXEDO
Get lost, meatbag.
ANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S
SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her
head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE
START from the alleyway.
THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her
body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night.
CAMERA PULLS UP to--
--an AERIAL VIEW of the rain-swept CITY, some futuristic
HIGH-RISES amongst the recognizeable landmarks. Also, a
great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES,
considerably larger than the ones we see today.
CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part
of the city, tenements and vacant lots. MOVE DOWN and
through a third-story window of--
RAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a
pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom,
gets to his feet and runs.
GREER looks down from the broken window.
--LEAPS, GREER hits the dirt hard and rolls. He reaches
the ground and sets off after the PSYCHO at top speed.
(CONTINUED)
6.
CONTINUED:
PLAY A FRANTIC FOOT CHASE, both men scramble over chain-
link fences, leap over trashed cars.
GREER pursues the PSYCHO around a corner, into a
passageway between buildings--
--wherethePSYCHO gets the jump on him, SWINGS a length
of pipeathis head. Greer ducks fast, the blow catches
him inthearm, he drops his gun. The PSYCHO moves to
pick uptheweapon, but Greer tackles him against a
dumpster.
Greer SLAMS the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly.
GREER
You have the right to remain silent--
But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash,
manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greer's eyes.
Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away,
running from between buildings across a street--
WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through
the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still
alive. He tries to get up, but--
GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast
against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes,
points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head.
GREER (CONT'D)
Stay with me asshole--
PSYCHO
Why would I do that?
The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back, eyes empty.
ON GREER'S SCANNER - "NEW-U RENTAL AGENCY," with an ID
NUMBER, but no name.
GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his
scanner. He's angry but resigned, he was half expecting
this.
THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He
calls out to Greer:
SEMI DRIVER
Am I in trouble?
GREER
(waves him off)
Nah, go back to work.
GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece.
IN BG, the DRIVER pulls away.
GREER (CONT'D)
PETERS (FILTER)
GREER
He's a rental.
He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one
side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore
and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY,
oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck.
We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated
synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not
artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly
to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away.
Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood
humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly
surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have
an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and
receiving impulses, they are completely inert.
Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around
at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND.
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
He won't let go. Greer stomps on the-PSYCHO's head,
reaches with his other hand into the back of the skull to
wrench out a CIRCUIT BOARD. The PSYCHO finally stops
writhing, disconnected.
GREER trudges toward the building, on his cell, leaving
the body behind. He turns the CIRCUIT BOARD over in his
fingers.
GREER
--trash pick-up on Maple and 4th.
DISPATCHER (FILTER)
Coulda just called it in, we'd a
shut him down from here--
GREER
Any ID from the rental agency?
DISPATCHER (FILTER)
Yeah, got a name from their office in
Miami. Ness, Harold P.
GREER
(A BEAT)
Harry P. Ness.
DISPATCHER
Oh. False ID?
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
GREER
You think?
DISPATCHER
Don't be in a rush to get home,
Tom. Two surries down outside The
Pit, hard-core club on F street.
GREER picks up the pace, heads OUT OF FRAME.
CUT TO:
START ON THE BLONDE, eyes empty, face against the cement.
PETERS
Abandoned.
GREER
Or something happened to the operator.
GREER and PETERS stand over the corpse, a UNIFORM stands
nearby. Greer holds his SCANNER near her head.
GREER (CONT'D)
Registered to a Cameron Michaels,
out in Clarksburg...
(TO UNIFORM)
You call her?
UNIFORM
Left a message.
GREER is leaning closer to the dead Blonde's face.
X-CLOSE-- CRACKS in the GLASS of her eye. We see GREER'S
FRAGMENTED REFLECTION as he peers at this.
GREER
Optics are damaged.
PETERS
Musta cracked when she fell.
(TO UNIFORM)
There's a second?
The UNIFORM leads GREER and PETERS past the blonde, into
the alley.
10.
A slightly futuristic sedan speeds through light late-
night traffic. We hear the VOICE of the PROPHET:
PROPHET (RADIO)
You feel you are free. You can be
what you want, do what you want,
nothing can hurt you. But you have
ceased to live.
MOVE ACROSS the facade of a suburban apartment complex.
A RED GLOW suffuses most of the windows, all of which are
BARRED. In this warm light, we glimpse OPERATORS in
reclining chairs, motionless. They could be watching TV,
but no sets are in sight.
MOVE TO FIND GREER and PETERS as they exit the sedan and
pass a sign: "SURROGATE-READY UNITS AVAILABLE."
13.
GREER approaches an urban APARTMENT COMPLEX on foot,
carrying a bag of TAKE-OUT FOOD. HIGH FENCES, SECURITY
CAMERAS and SCANNERS, all commonplace in this world. We
see the RED GLOW from a few windows.
GREER and PETERS move from the entrance to Canter's
residential high-rise.
PETERS
So we're talking mistaken T.D.
GREER
Someone targeted Canter's surrie,
got the wrong operator.
They get to their car, parked in a RED ZONE. GREER curls
his lip at a METER MAID-- a DRONE SURROGATE ON WHEELS, NO
EARS, as it rolls calmly away from his car.
GREER (CONT'D)
I'm sure the guy's got enemies he
never even heard of.
PETERS
My money's on the Dreads.
(off Greer's look)
Excuse me, the "humans."
Greer rips the TICKET from the windshield, tears it in
half and throws it in the back of the car, as they both
get in.
CUT TO:
GREER and PETERS move from a glass corporate tower,
across beautifully manicured gardens. GREER carries the
evidence in a briefcase.
PETERS
What's our take-away?
GREER
(SHRUGS)
I used to be able to read people,
back when they were people...
PETERS
You mean before they all became
lawyers?
GREER
(A SMILE)
You made a joke. Maybe there's
hope for you, Peters...
They head for a MANUFACTURING COMPLEX.
32.
A FIREFIGHT in a bombed-out DESERT TOWN, somewhere in the
Middle East. A GRUNT'S POV as a small group of SURROGATE
SOLDIERS, the generic "GI JOE" types we saw at VSI, clean
up an insurgent outpost.
PULASKI, a gung-ho SURRIE SOLDIER, charges into MACHINE
GUN FIRE and is BLOWN TO PIECES.
HANGARS, boxy buildings, HUMVEES, SOLDIERS marching in
formation. BRANDON walks with GREER and PETERS.
BRANDON
The United States has the largest
surrogate army in.the world. Why
on earth would the defense
department want to develop a
weapon that could wipe out our own
troops?
GREER
So no such thing exists?
BRANDON
If it did, I'd know about it.
PETERS
Those soldiers we saw--
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
BRANDON
(a bit impatient)
We routinely remove motherboards
and optics for analysis. Now if
you'll excuse me, we're in the
middle of a peacekeeping operation.
They've reached their car. Brandon turns on his heel and
heads back for a hangar. Greer and Peters look after him
for a moment.
PETERS
Think he's telling the truth?
GREER
Not when his lips are moving.
Greer shakes his head as they both get in the car.
WITH BRANDON - Out of earshot of the feds, he speaks into
a small earpiece.
BRANDON
Bill, we may have a problem. Is it
possible one of our ODs is loose?
CUT TO:
WITH STRICKLAND, finishing his cell call.
STRICKLAND
.maybe I'm not done with the
O.D. Maybe you're not gonna get
it back at all. Guy could have a
lot of fun with your little toy...
oh you can do better than that.
I'll be in touch...
He tosses the cellphone in a trashcan, pulls on his
helmet, STARTS the bike and peels out.
42.
AERIAL SHOT - CAMERA tracking over the CHESAPEAKE BAY and
into the city, late afternoon. A small black CHOPPER
with doorless openings on either side ENTERS FRAME.
THE CHOPPER banks and swoops almost silently.
TNT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY
BOBBY glances over at PETERS as she monitors a GPS SCREEN
and various INSET VIDEO FEEDS. He continues to work as
he flirts with her.
BOBBY
You really look like your surrie?
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
PETERS throws him a glare, turns back to her work.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Don't be so touchy. I'm engaged
to B-47 down there.
He points to one of the many identical female DRONES
buzzing along the tracks. PETERS smiles.
STRICKLAND moves briskly on his BIKE. He glances in his
MIRROR and sees--
--a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him.
He hits the THROTTLE. ANOTHER COP CAR roars around the
corner ahead of him, SQUAWKS the SIREN. STRICKLAND
changes direction, veers into a narrow alley.
The alley is a DEAD END, a FENCE blocking the exit.
STRICKLAND skids the bike into a CRASHING STOP, knocking
over piles of GARBAGE.
A SQUAD CAR barely clears the walls on either side,
pursuing. It stops at a narrowing space, cops squeeze
out either door, aiming GUNS.
COP
Freeze!
STRICKLAND stumbles away from his bike, into an alcove.
The cops approach, guns ready.
STRICKLAND yanks off his helmet, pulls his ominous DEVICE
from his pocket. Without poking his head out, he aims it
in the cops direction.
He PRESSES A BUTTON. A row of RED DIODES GLOW on the
device as he sweeps it across the alley, but it emits no
projectiles and makes no sound.
COP #1 is closer-- his GLASS EYES SHATTER.
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:
COP #2 drops his weapon, staggers backward and falls,
clutching his head.
STRICKLAND looks up to see GREER taking aim from the
silent chopper. He leaps for cover behind a dumpster as--
GREER FIRES a DART, which RICOCHETS off the DUMPSTER.
STRICKLAND scrambles around a corner.
STRICKLAND raises the device to track Lopez and hits the
button-- we see the RED DIODES GLOW and--
THE CHOPPER, pilotless and out of control, heads over the
chain link fence. Beyond are vacant lots, with tents and
makeshift hovels, small buildings.
THE CHOPPER CRASHES on its skids, at an angle, amidst
LEAN-TOs and TENTS-- GREER is thrown out his side with
the impact.
THE CHOPPER'S ENGINE EXPLODES. THE WHIRRING TAIL ROTOR
comes right at him and CHOPS OFF his left arm at the
elbow, BURNING FUEL spreads and IGNITES his back. Lucky
thing he's a surrogate. Less fortunate DREADS run
screaming, we hear the CRIES OF WOUNDED.
GREER lies in the dirt, in flames, motionless. Then his
eyes BLINK and move, taking in the sight of--
STRICKLAND, illuminated by the FIRE, horrified at the
carnage. He's starting to move away from the wreck.
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
With supreme effort, GREER gets to his feet, still partly
IN FLAMES. His stump of an arm SPARKS and leaks
HYDRAULIC FLUID. He reacts at the sight of--
A CORPSE on the ground, an older man crushed by a hunk of
DEBRIS from the chopper. But it's not the corpse that
interests him-- his DART RIFLE lies nearby, thrown from
the chopper during the crash.
GREER grabs it in his right hand. He pushes past DREADS
who move to help their injured fellows, PANIC in the fire-
lit no man's land. He spots--
STRICKLAND, running into the distance. Greer supports
the rifle with the stump of his missing arm and FIRES--
STRICKLAND is hit in the back, the force of the shot
knocks him off his feet.
GREER strides over to STRICKLAND, seemingly oblivious to
the CROWD of Dreads collecting around him, pointing at
him angrily.
STRICKLAND twitches and moans, partly paralyzed. GREER
stands over him, lets the rifle dangle. Strickland has
some trouble speaking.
STRICKLAND
Oh my G-god-- why? What do you
people want from me?!
GREER
You're a killer--
STRICKLAND
They were just surries! Goddamn
machines!
GREER
(A BEAT)
You really don't know?
BLAM! A DOUBLE-BARRELED SHOTGUN BLAST throws GREER
backward, away from STRICKLAND. The DART RIFLE flies
from his grasp.
A heavyset FEMALE DREAD wields the sawed-off shotgun.
She gets between Greer and Strickland, who manages to
crawl away, vanishing behind other DREADS who are
gathering around Greer.
GREER (CONT'D)
Strickland! Wait!
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED: (2)
Greer tries to get up, a HOLE has been blown in his
chest, exposing SPARKING WIRES and ELECTRONICS, spraying
GREEN COOLANT. He's lost control of his legs, which
crumple beneath him, he falls to his knees.
He's surrounded now by angry, disenfranchised DREADS, all
of whom regard him with hatred.
THE FEMALE DREAD ejects the used cartridges and reloads
the shotgun. GREER stares at her coldly.
GREER (CONT'D)
I'm a federal agent--
FEMALE DREAD
You're an abomination.
THE WOMAN pumps the shotgun again points it a Greer's
head. Just as it GOES OFF--
CUT TO:
START ON a MAILBOX with the name "PETERS," as CARLIGHTS
catch it. As the CAR turns up the dirt road in this
rural area in the Rockies, it flips its LIGHTS OFF.
PETERS strides from the doors, GREER follows, dressed in
casual clothes... then slows his pace, breathing hard.
GREER'S POV - CARS zipping past on the street, RUSHING
PEDESTRIANS, PARAMEDICS pushing a body past on a gurney.
From Greer's now human perspective, surrogates seem
artificial, appearance too perfect, eyes empty of souls.
This should be reeling, vertiginous.
PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack. He
has trouble speaking.
GREER
I haven't been out without a
surrogate in a long time...
PETERS
It's OK. Nothing's gonna happen.
GREER
They wanted to give me something
for the anxiety... they call it
corporeaphobia.
PETERS
Just take my arm.
He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and moves out
onto the sidewalk. Peters stays close.
GREER'S POV - SURRIE PEDESTRIANS, moving quickly, seeming
to come right. at him. One bumps into him--
GREER staggers, the surrie moves on as if he hasn't even
noticed. Greer moves toward the curb to get away from
them, stumbles-- PETERS has to pull him out of CAR
TRAFFIC, a HORN HONKS. He's sweating, terrified.
GREER
Jesus Christ.
PETERS
We need to get you a replacement.
She takes his arm forcibly and moves him away.
56.
A low-end place, BODIES displayed in the windows in their
charging bays, SIGNS reading "HURRY 4 A SURRY! GIANT
SALE! SYNTH UNITS NEW & USED!"
PETERS guides GREER inside.
subway,
GREER and PETERS walk, he spots a sign for the
changes direction to head for the escalator.
PETERS
Where you going?
GREER
It's a lovely day. Thought I'd take
a trip to East Baltimore.
He pauses at the top, a hit of vertigo.
GREER (CONT'D)
Was it always this steep?
PETERS
Jesus, Tom, the rez?
GREER
Since I'm stuck in my skin, I
oughta take advantage of it. Hell,
as long as Strickland has that
device-- I'm safer this way.
He clutches the handrail, starts moving down.
PETERS
Be careful.
He nods and waves as he disappears down the escalator.
CUT TO:
61.
Late afternoon. GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same
gate we saw earlier. Greer wobbles, steadies himself
against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE
SURROGATE, built into the seat.
CABBIE
You OK, man?
GREER
Just a little carsick.
The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE.
AT THE GATE: METAL SIGNS read "HUMANS ONLY - NO
SURROGATES." GREER goes through a big,.old-fashioned
(present-day) METAL DETECTOR, the light flashes GREEN. A
DREAD GUARD waves him past. Greer gestures toward one of
the many IMAGES OF THE PROPHET to be found in the rez.
GREER
Where would I find the, the what do
you call it, the Temple?
DREAD GUARD
Ten blocks that way, left on
Bloomfield.
GREER
Thanks.
(eyes the grim area)
Catch a lotta surries tryin' to
sneak in, do ya?
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
DREAD GUARD
Piss off.
As Greer crosses the rubble-strewn no man's land, he
pauses, sickened as he sees--
--the burned-out HELICOPTER HULK, now sprayed with
GRAFITTI. "PIGS DIE," etc. And just beyond this--
--what's left of GREER'S SURRIE, half the head blown off
with fried electronics hanging out. It's been lashed to
a makeshift crucifix, made from the bent CHOPPER BLADES.
The clothing is shredded, the remains spray-painted.
GREER, wary of being recognized, continues on.
GREER walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant
neighborhood-- rowhouses, gardens. Very few cars.
DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks.
A BARBECUE, a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking.
Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes, smiles to himself.
A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him for a
moment, then return to the barbecue. GREER, not paying
attention, brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN.
GREER
Excuse me.
PEDESTRIAN
(smiles and nods)
No problem.
A PLAYGROUND a short distance on,.LOTS OF KIDS shrieking
and running. Greer pauses here, taking this in. These
are the first children we've seen, outside of a TV ad.
A CLOUD OF DIESEL SMOKE from a decrepit BUS. Greer
CHOKES on this, but doesn't seem displeased. His body
language has become more relaxed as he gets further into
the rez, getting his land legs back.
GREER moves down a path in this expanse of greenery. He
comes to an open lawn with a fairly large CROWD gathered,
illuminated by a FLAMING TORCH.
THE PROPHET is speaking. He stands before a platform
atop wooden scaffolding, firewood piled below. A
formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the
gathered throng of DREADS.
PROPHET
--serving faithfully beside us in
the cause of humanity. _I had the
privilege of hearing his confession
shortly before his death.
GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a
look at the BODY atop the funeral BIER.
The corpse atop the bier is that of JACK STRICKLAND, eyes
closed, hands folded.
PROPHET (CONT'D)
And I know he would have rejoiced
in the day of resurrection, the
day for which we are all
preparing, the day I promise you
is close at hand...
So saying, the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to
the base of the PYRE, which ERUPTS IN FLAME.
CLOSE ON STRICKLAND as the FLAMES lick up around him.
LATER, the BIER consumed in FIRE, the MOURNERS
dispersing. THE PROPHET is moving away, HANDLERS
surrounding him. GREER tags along-- but one of the
Prophet's goons, BUD, gets in his face.
(CONTINUED)
65
CONTINUED:
BUD
Who are you?
GREER
What happened to Jack Strickland?
BUD
He slipped and fell. Friend of yours?
Greer starts to move around him, Bud gets in his way.
GREER
I'd like a word with the Prophet.
BUD
You and everyone else.
MILLER and ADAMS, another goon, now join them.
GREER
Strickland was carrying a weapon.
If it isn't recovered, there could
be serious consequences-- for all
of you.
IN BG, the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV.
MILLER
You some kinda cop? Where's your
puppet?
GREER
Needs repairs.
MILLER
You armed?
GREER shakes his head, raises his hands.
GREER
Frisk me if you want.
MILLER
No, that's OK.
With that, he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut. GREER
doubles over. He seems amazed at the sensation, the
pain. But he recovers, throws a wild punch at Miller an d
misses by a foot. [Violence for Greer in human form
should have a very different, painfully visceral feel,
unlike when he was a surrogate.]
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED: (2)
ADAMS cracks Greer across the back of his head. GREER
falls to the ground. BUD kicks him once. GREER chokes
and groans in pain.
MILLER (CONT'D)
Hurts, doesn't it.
BUD
It's a bitch being real.
GREER lets out a primal CRY and lunges at MILLER, driving
his head into the man's torso, knocking the wind out of
him before the other two can pull Greer back.
ADAMS
I think he likes it.
MILLER
(catching his breath)
So give him some more.
Outnumbered three to one, Greer takes a beating,
continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just
cause the men to redouble their efforts. Finally, he's
limp in their arms.
Miller plucks Greer's WALLET and BADGE from his pockets,
examines them. As he does so, GREER spits BLOOD on the
man's face. Miller seems about to whomp him again, but
stops himself.
MILLER (CONT'D)
Not gonna give you the
satisfaction.
(to Bud and Adams)
Get him out of here.
Miller tosses Greer's ID at him, then moves toward the
RV, leaving GREER gasping in the clutches of Bud and
Adams, lit by the FLAMES from the funeral pyre.
GREER is half-dragged, half-carried, back the way he
came, flanked by BUD and ADAMS. Greer sucks on his
BLEEDING lip, works his tongue around in his mouth. He
touches parts of his bruised body carefully.
BUD
Guy like you oughtn't be out in
just your skin.
GREER
I'm starting to see your point.
AT THE GATE - GREER leaves, trying to muster as much
dignity as he can. The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically
after him.
DREAD GUARD
Come again real soon!
GREER trudges along the seedy streets. He looks a mess--
torn clothing, bloodstains, bruises. Suddenly he's
SHOVED from behind, falls to the pavement.
WHEELS
Oops.
The assailant is a FREAK SURRIE-- extra ARMS, WHEELS
where his feet should be.
A moment later, Greer is surrounded by three rich, FREAKY
TEENS.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
They've customized their surries in completely bizarre
ways, in addition to the usual tattoos and piercings.
Besides WHEELS, there's a hairless teen with six EYES
scattered around his head. A GIRL has SPIKES sticking
out of her skull and flesh and REPTILE SKIN.
EYES
Watch where you're going, meat.
SPIKES
What are you doin' off the rez?
She bumps against GREER as he picks himself up, he
shrinks from the spikes. She shoots a small blast of
FLAME from her nostrils, then GIGGLES.
GREER
I'm not a Dread.
WHEELS
Then you oughta return that
surrie, looks like shit.
WHEELS comes at Greer again, Greer moves and TRIPS him--
but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself.
EYES
Hey, it wants to play.
EYES lowers his head and moves to butt him. GREER
dodges, it looks like a bullfight.
SPIKES
Ole, toro!
They turn, hearing a SCREECH OF TIRES.
A LIMOUSINE has pulled up. A 10-year-old BOY climbs from
the back and approaches.
BOY
Agent Greer. Would you like a ride?
The kid's voice sounds like a child's, but with mature
cadences to his speech. -
WHEELS
Check out Richie Rich.
THE DRIVER of the Limo steps out-- it's ARMANDO from
Canter's lobby. He lets his jacket fall open, revealing
a HOLSTERED SIDEARM.
(CONTINUED)
69
CONTINUED: (2)
ARMANDO
We got a problem here?
The FREAKS retreat with dirty looks.
SPIKES
Fascists.
The BOY moves back toward the LIMO. Greer follows.
BOY
(re: the freaks)
So many unforeseen consequences to
the surrogate revolution... I
suppose I should apologize.
GREER
Who are you?
THE LIMO drives along the Potomac near the city.
THE LIMO stops, a light RAIN now falling. GREER gets out
and closes the door, the rear window rolls down.
BOY/CANTER
Somebody hired Strickland. You'll
know who that is when you trace
the weapon.
GREER
You really don't need to do my job
for me.
Boy/Canter takes in Greer's disheveled state.
BOY/CANTER
Yes, I can see you've got things
under control.
The limo pulls away. Greer pauses, looks up at the sky,
letting the rain wash over his face.
GREER walks in the RAIN through nearly empty streets
toward the modern headquarters in Washington. There are
BOARDS over the shattered windows in front.
ESTABLISH a dreary place near the highway. A RED GLOW
from a number of windows... FIND A WINDOW illuminated by
WHITE LIGHT. We see GREER within.
85.
THE FBI SEDAN drives down a curving, forested road.
THE DREADS emerge from tents and shacks at the sound of a
nearby RUMBLING.
ANGLE THROUGH FENCE - BULLDOZERS, TANKS, uniformed
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN (all surrogates with the SAME FACE)
are assembling on the perimeter of the Dread reservation.
They carry non-lethal TASER WANDS and RIFLES.
An OFFICER moves to the front, carrying a WALKIE-TALKIE.
In response to a command, he turns and signals to the
troops behind him and--
--the BULLDOZERS start PLOWING DOWN the fence. As
Guardsmen move past him, the officer calls out:
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
OFFICER
We all know what we're looking
for! Remember these are
biologicals, do not fire unless
absolutely necessary!
As he runs from the building, the PROPHET is TACKLED by a
GUARDSMAN. He turns the man over, the Prophet's eyes are
empty, his head lolls back.
A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM from nearby as a YOUNG FEMALE
DREAD takes this in.
YOUNG DREAD
They've killed him! They've
killed the Prophet!
Other DREADS nearby react, the CRY spreading.
WITH THE GUARDSMAN, examining the body. The Prophet is
already rigid... and GREEN COOLANT is spreading from an
exit wound in his chest. A guardsman rips open his
shirt, pokes at the wound--
ELECTRONICS and TORN PLASTIC.
THE GUARDSMAN's amazed, gets on his WALKIE-TALKIE.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
GUARDSMAN
Captain, you'd better come see this.
Nearby Guardsmen react to the furious DREADS massing
around them. A GRENADE LANDS nearby, GUARDSMAN #2 throws
himself on it, his SURRIE BLOWS UP. GUNFIRE ERUPTS
nearby, a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL sails through the air.
GUARDSMAN #3
We need to clear out!
CUT TO:
Late in the afternoon. Rolling green hills, trees, a
rural area. A white COMPACT CAR pulls up a dirt road,
past the MAILBOX with "PETERS" painted on it.
THE COMPACT pulls to a stop.
GENERIC/GREER climbs out of the car. He's blandly
handsome, in a business suit, with perfect hair that
looks glued in place. His movements are stilted, this is
a cheap model and he's not used to it.
GENERIC/GREER steps onto the porch, knocks on the door.
No answer. He tries the knob-- locked.
His voice is deep, again generic.
GENERIC/GREER
Peters! It's me, Tom Greer!
He moves along the side of the house, peers in a window--
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - a STIM-CHAIR sits empty. Dangling
wires, the SENSORY PROJECTOR and HARD DRIVE have been
stolen.
GENERIC/GREER SMASHES the window with his fist and climbs
inside.
A handful of DREADS are storming down the street,
SMASHING WINDOWS and bowling over any SURRIES who get in
their way.
A SCROLLING ELECTRONIC NEWS CRAWL on the side of a
building: "PROPHET SHOT, REPORTED DEAD..."
GREER is walking fast, on the phone, steering clear of
the angry Dreads.
GREER
It's an emergency, you need to
connect me now!
GREER has stopped, stunned. Then, realizing what's
happening, he takes off at a sprint in a different
direction. He makes another call:
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
GREER (ON PHONE)
Maggie, please pick up-- damn it,
you have to disconnect as soon as
you get this message-- get off
line, abandon your surrogate!
You're in danger, everyone is--
GREER has come out on the roof. There's an enormous CELL
TOWER and DISH up here. He moves to the edge, peers over
warily.
ANGLE DOWN - forty stories down to the street.
GREER flinches back, reeling with vertigo. He moves
along the edge, looking for something.
ANGLE DOWN - the BALCONY outside Canter's study, just
inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop.
GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what
he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge,
trying not to look down. He swings his body to get the
momentum going the right way--
--but his grip gives a moment too soon--
GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting
the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way.
But he manages to grab onto the metal. He hauls himself
up and collapses onto the balcony, lying on his back.
HIS LEG has been injured in the fall, the pants torn,
blood. GREER breathes audibly, in pain and exhaustion.
LATE AFTERNOON, golden light. DREADS have been herded
together here, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN surrounding them.
Suddenly the GUARDSMEN all DROP at once.
114.
CROWDED, rush hour, lots of traffic and noise. Then--
--PEDESTRIANS fall in a wave. CARS VEER out of control,
SMASHING INTO EACH OTHER, careening onto the sidewalk,
rolling over fallen surrie bodies and SMASHING into
storefronts.
ANGLE DOWN on the suddenly quiet street. The surries
have dropped throughout the city.
PULL BACK to reveal GREER looking down on this. He limps
quickly back inside--
The moment the Dreads have been waiting for. With a mass
CRY, they're charging over the fallen BODIES of the
GUARDSMEN and over the flattened fences.
WIDE as THOUSANDS OF DREADS run out of the reservation
into the streets of the city.
115.
GREER hobbles through the dreadful aftermath-- SMOKING
AUTO PILEUPS, BODIES everywhere, most fallen in their
tracks, a few remain on their feet. CAR HORNS, ALARMS in
the distance. -
A few disheveled DREADS are here, taking it in with
delight and amazement. They WHOOP as they TIP OVER a
couple of the standing surries.
GREER passes a CAR on the sidewalk, its DRIVER slumped
against the wheel-- the RADIO BLARES:
RADIO VOICE
The massive surrogate shutdown
appears to be nationwide...
FALLEN SURRIES all over the grounds. ARMED DREADS are
rushing into the place, past the MOTIONLESS SENTRIES.
They're making for the factory.
RADIO VOICE
Rioters presumed to be members of
the Human Coalition seem to be
making coordinated attacks on
SURROGATE-RELATED BUSINESSES
across the country...
GREER makes his way toward his place.
--OUT THE WINDOW. MOVE to show exterior DOORS OPENING
and GREER'S NEIGHBORS EMERGING, blinking in the
unfamiliar sunlight. Most wear robes, sweatclothes.
They're all ages, some overweight, others homely-- it's
almost a relief after all the young, perfect people.
DOWN THE STREET, OTHERS EMERGE, regard each other warily,
like people after an earthquake. Some begin speaking to
each other for the first time, in whispers at first,
others take in the SUNSET which bathes the neighborhood
in orange light.
FADE TO BLACK.
