    truck idling in the alley, the bored DRIVER at the Wheel.
    The truck's hydraulic arm lifts the only dumpster in the
    alley and empties it into the back of the vehicle.

    He grimaces, realizing he's too late.  He glances around to
    make sure no one can see, then SPINS, becoming Superman.  As
    the hydraulic arm lowers the dumpster, Superman LEAPS unseen
    into the rear of the truck.  Superman BURROWS through the
    rubbish at SUPERSPEED, trash flying out of the truck left
    and right.

    Superman finds the envelope.  Written on the outside are the
    words SUPERMAN.  As the driver steps out of his cab,
    Superman LEAPS out of the truck.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Don't worry.  I'll take care of it.

    The driver stares in awe as Superman tosses the rubbish
    back in at SUPERSPEED.

                   mistake.

    INTERCUT WITH:



    Superman WALKS down the sidewalk, sniffing, following the
    scent from his apartment.  Passersby pause and look at him
    in puzzlement Superman steps into the street, walks 
    through oncoming traffic, oblivious to the commotion he's 
    causing, and crosses to the other sidewalk, continuing along 
    his way.


21  CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN'S FACE                                        21

    IN on his face, we go to...


22  SUPERMAN'S POV - THE SIDEWALK/STREET                             22   

    In a Zarate SFX, we do an EXTREME RACK FOCUS, from the 
    street to a flurry of floating SCENT MOLECULES.  The street 
    is a blurry background.  The scent molecules appear from the 
    distance and bob towards camera in ones and twos as Superman 
    moves forward.  It's similar to moving through the star 
    field in Star Wars, except there are only a few molecules 
    and they float and drift erratically, being blown by the 
    wind.

    We HEAR Superman still sniffing and then we FADE IN 
    something else that Superman's SUPERHEARING picks up: it 
    seems like a dozen other noses sniffing.


23  SUPERMAN                                                         23   

    stops on the sidewalk and slowly turns around.  A whole
    CROWD of curious people are trailing behind him sniffing,
    trying to smell what he's smelling.  It's as if he were the
    Pied Piper of Hamlin.

                                    SUPERMAN
                         (slightly embarrassed)
                   It's... okay. There's nothing to
                   be worried about.  Everything's
                   under control.  I'm just...
                         (lamely)
                   checking something out.  So...
                   don't mind me.

    He turns back around, does a SUPER SNIFF strong enough to 
    roll trash along the sidewalk, whip a newspaper out of a 
    man's hand and pull a woman's hat off.  He catches the hat 
    and hands it back to her.

                                    SUPERMAN (CONT'D)
                   Sorry.

    and heads off.

    MARVIN, a large African-American who looks like he used to 
    play football; delicately tends the flowers on display in 
    front of his store, in particular a cascade of orchids.  
    Still sniffing, Superman rounds the corner and walks right 
    up to Marvin.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Excuse me, sir what kind of
                   orchids are those?

                                    MARVIN

                   unless you know something about 
                   getting rid of aphids, beat it.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Un, I could give them a stern
                   talking to.

    For the first time Marvin looks up.  He's surprised to see 
    it's Superman.

                                    MARVIN
                   Superman.  Sorry, I... uh, didn't
                   know it was you.

                                    SUPERMAN
                         (smiles)
                   That's okay.
                         (studies Marvin)
                   Didn't you used to play for the
                   Bills?

                                    MARVIN
                   Til my knee blew out.  Now I do 
                   this.  It's much more relaxing, and 
                   _definitely_ less painful.

    Superman picks up the stem of orchids.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   I'm looking for a man who's wearing
                   one of these.

                                    MARVIN
                   Don't actually sell many of them to 
                   people off the street.  Haven't 
                   sold one to a man in weeks.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   This one was fresh.  It almost
                   smelled like cherry vanilla.

    Dark, still, a little spooky.  Clark appears next to a

    He starts to draw his arm away but she snuggles closer.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, I've been thinking...

                                    LOIS
                   Me too.

                                    CLARK
                   What about?

                                    LOIS
                   You first.

                                    CLARK
                   Okay.

    They stop at a fountain.  He looks at her.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D) 
                   I've been thinking about how when 
                   something bad happens, it makes you 
                   realize that most of what you spend 
                   your days worrying about doesn't 
                   matter at all...
                         (pause)
                   Almost losing you the way I did,
                   I... I feel ashamed.

                                    LOIS
                   Ashamed, why?

                                    CLARK
                   I kept pushing you away, even when 
                   I promised I'd stop.  And if you'd 
                   died not knowing how much I love 
                   you, I'd've never forgiven myself.  
                   Because you are the most beautiful, 
                   unique soul I've ever come across.
                         (pause)
                   Lois...

    It starts to THUNDER and LIGHTNING.  Clark looks heavenward.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Oh, come on, give me a break
                   here...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                    LOIS
                   Do you want to go back?

                                    CLARK
                   If the Earth opened up at my feet, 
                   I wouldn't move till I'd finished 
                   saying this.
                         (sits bar on edge of
                          fountain)
                   Lois...
                         (he drops to one knee)
                   will you marry me?

    He offers her a ring.  The rain begins to beat down on them.
    She leans, so close her wet lips almost touch his.

                                    LOIS
                   Who's asking?  Clark... or
                   Superman?

    Off his shock,  and the cryptic look on her race we...

    SUPERIMPOSE: TO BE CONTINUED.
