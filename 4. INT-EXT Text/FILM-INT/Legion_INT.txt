Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.
Quiet except for the
sound of RAIN, then...
SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a
shower of glass.
Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.
His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.
His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is
a living book. But the writing is in no language we
recognize.
He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.
FRESH. BLOODY.
He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,
and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the
cement floor around his feet.
Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the
ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,
his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life
for this.
Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.
Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.
Stops cold.
The place is locked up tight.
Metal gate over the front
doors, bars over the windows.
How the hell's he going to get
out of here?
4.
Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's
BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.
The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.
Busy night.
Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a
deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the
streetwalkers.
BURTON
Goddamn' animals. Nights like this
I wish I could take a match to this
city just so I could watch all
these motherfuckers burn.
ESTEVEZ
(LAUGHS)
A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?
Burton doesn't even smile.
He's dead fucking serious.
BURTON
A fresh start. That's what this
place needs.
He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people
they pass, picking them off one by one.
BURTON
Pow!
Pow!
Pow!
Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.
Estevez eyes his
partner, wary.
ESTEVEZ
Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so
happy we get to share beautiful
moments like this. They really
brighten my da--
KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE
just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.
Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time
to see...
Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped
bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got
shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.
BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine
roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in
the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.
The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm
you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old
plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and
tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded
diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off
the Shopping Network.
Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an
ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine
stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.
You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer
drinker.
Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is
cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed
dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when
your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.
The
dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's
hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.
PERCY
Lord as my witness, Bob, one of
these days that thing's gonna hit
you back.
WHACK!
BOB
Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We
got a special relationship here.
WHACK!
PERCY
Yeah, they got names for that kind
a relationship.
The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the
MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE".
A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair
and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the
jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling
as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that
really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a
billboard of rebellion.
SANDRA (O.S.)
It's disgusting.
11.
HOWARD (O.S.)
You're right. It is disgusting.
Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the
diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA
and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water.
SANDRA
Really, how can she go out in
public wearing that?
HOWARD
I don't know. Why don't we just
ask her?
SANDRA
Howard, don't. You'll embarrass
me.
HOWARD
(shouting across the
DINER)
Audrey, honey? Your mother was
wondering if you got dressed this
morning with the specific intention
of showing your ass off to the
entire world?
The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard
with a caustic smile.
AUDREY
Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping
to get double teamed by a couple of
meth head truckers in the bathroom
of some desert shithole.
(BEAT)
Good thing we stopped here.
And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches
the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it.
Howard turns back to his wife.
Rigid smile.
HOWARD
I feel satisfied with that answer.
I really do.
Sandra buries her face in her hands.
SANDRA
I'm being punished for something, I
know it.
12.
Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the
music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP.
CUT TO:
DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT
The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through
this barren country.
A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path.
HEAVY BEATS thunder
from within.
The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS
(late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad
boy.
He passes a weathered road sign:
"ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES"
Kyle's expression says this is not good news.
He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.
No signal.
KYLE
Shit...
He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...
The DOOR JINGLES.
Charlie and Kyle enter.
Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle. He notices her as
well. How couldn't he? She's directing every ounce of sex
appeal she has in his direction.
Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in
Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban
nightmare.
Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of
smokes from underneath the counter.
15.
CHARLIE
I hope Salem Lights are okay,
`cause that's all we got left.
KYLE
If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.
BOB (O.S.)
Where ya been, Charlie?
Bob steps off the chair.
BOB
This ain't a resort you know.
I
got orders stacking up here.
In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it
certainly makes Bob feel better to say it.
BOB
(sees the two cigarettes
Kyle's handing her)
You best not be smokin' again.
Not
in your condition.
CHARLIE
(gestures to the diner)
Bob, do you see where am I right
now? Can my condition really get
any worse? `Sides, you ain't one
to talk.
BOB
What?
I quit two years ago.
CHARLIE
Yeah, so why you still carryin'
that fancy lighter `round for?
BOB
It was a gift from my ex-wife,
alright? I'm sentimental. I don't
wanna forget how much I hate her
guts.
KYLE
Hey man?
Bob turns to Kyle.
Doesn't like what he sees.
KYLE
Can I use your phone? My cell
doesn't get a signal out here and
the pay phone outside is busted.
Bob is about to respond when:
16.
HOWARD (O.S.)
Excuse me...?
Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's
interrupting.
HOWARD
Any news about when our truck might
be fixed? You said your boy would
have us on the road two hours ago.
The rate we're going, we'll be
lucky to make it to Scottsdale by
Christmas.
Bob's expression darkens at this news.
BOB
Goddamn it. Where the hell is
Jeep?
CUT TO:
A GRIMY PIECE OF WOOD
A cloth wipes away the dirt, revealing the partial image of
an ANGEL carved into the surface.
Jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a
workbench. There's an unsettling intensity in his eyes, as
if fear itself were driving him.
BOB (O.S.)
Hey, Leonardo...!
Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to
see his father standing next to the Anderson's broken-down
Uhual.
BOB
The fact that this truck's hood's
up mean anything to you?
Jeep stares at the ground.
Couldn't be anymore
uncomfortable.
JEEP
Yeah...
BOB
(approaches, peering past
him to the crib)
(MORE)
17.
BOB (cont'd)
Whaddya workin' on that's so
goddamn important you're not doin'
your job?
JEEP
Nothin'...
Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails.
Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.
JEEP
Found it under a bunch of stuff in
the storage shed. I know you never
like to throw anything away...
Bob considers him, softens.
BOB
Whaddya doin'?
JEEP
What...?
BOB
Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I
think it's real good of you to lend
her a helping hand, but she is not
your responsibility.
JEEP
(heard this before, pushes
past him)
Oh whatever, leave me alone.
BOB
Don't walk away from me while I'm
talkin' to you!
Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter,
digging into a plate of banana pancakes.
Kyle is about to address him again, when something else
steals Bob's attention.
BOB
(holding up a silencing
HAND)
Yeah, wait a minute.
The TV has gone on the fritz again.
Only now the image is
mostly snow.
Bob climbs back onto the chair.
Faces the TV.
BOB
What's wrong with you today?
WHACK!
The image flickers but doesn't improve.
PERCY
I told you to get the satellite TV.
But you don't wanna listen.
BOB
What the hell do I need that crap
for?
PERCY
History Channel, man!
20.
BOB
I got all the history I can take.
CHARLIE
That's for sure.
BOB
What's your problem now?
WHACK!
CHARLIE
Where do I start?
BOB
You know this was the top-of-the-
line model when I bought it.
CHARLIE
Yeah, in the Fifties.
BOB
You shouldn't be watchin' anyways.
(rubs his hands together)
Okay, baby, this is gonna do it.
Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK!
And the picture snaps into FOCUS.
Only it isn't the picture
he was expecting.
The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and
its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner.
Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.
BOB
See?
Clear as day.
PERCY
Nice work, Bob. What the hell's
that?
BOB
It's just one of those test things.
That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the
screen, which read:
"THIS IS NOT A TEST"
Bob switches the channels.
All the same.
CHARLIE
Don't look like a test.
21.
Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the TV as
if a little distance will bring some clarity. He bumps into
Kyle.
KYLE
Yo, am I the Invisible
motherfuckin' Man here?
Do you
have a phone or not?
Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH.
That gets Bob's attention. Bob snaps the money out of his
hand.
BOB
In the back past the kitchen.
Make
it fast.
Kyle hustles passed Percy.
Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes.
Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV.
SANDRA
If there's a real emergency aren't
they supposed to give us some
information about what to do?
HOWARD
I'm sure it's a mistake.
BOB
Hey, Percy, give that old radio of
yours a shot. Maybe they got some
news about the TV.
Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf.
Switches it on.
STATIC.
He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal.
The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting.
Station
after station the same thing.
The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW
TONES. Everyone goes very still.
KYLE (V.O.)
Let me talk to him...
Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back
office, phone to his ear.
22.
KYLE (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Cuz a father should be able to talk
to his son, that's why. Now put
`im on the phone.
(a beat then a smile)
Is that my little man...? Yeah,
well I'm working hard, so that I
can be with you. You bein' good?
(strange STATIC can be
HEARD)
Wait... You're breakin' up.
Hello...?
(hangs up in frustration)
Shit!
Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial.
Frowns. No dial tone.
KYLE
What the hell...
He keeps trying.
Nothing.
HOWARD (V.O.)
Maybe there was an earthquake?
Everyone is looking at Howard.
HOWARD
They keep sayin' we're overdue for
a big one.
PERCY
Lot a folks could be hurt.
BOB
Not if it was centered in the
desert.
HOWARD
Exactly.
Could be nothing to worry
about.
SANDRA
So then why's the TV out?
HOWARD
Maybe it just hit the relay
stations. Aren't those usually in
remote areas?
23.
BOB
Yeah, `cause of the radiation they
give off.
PERCY
There ain't no radiation comin'
from those things. Plus that don't
explain the radio being out too.
Some of those stations broadcast
over hundreds of miles. Any quake
that big and we would a felt it.
CHARLIE
Percy's right. I didn't feel
nothing.
AUDREY
Maybe it's a terrorist attack or
something...?
SANDRA
(covers her mouth)
Oh god...
Everyone considers that grimly, then:
BOB
Well, for cryin' out loud. There's
no use in speculating. I'll just
call my brother up in Needles. He
must a heard something.
KYLE (O.S.)
I don't think so.
Kyle has reappeared in the diner.
BOB
Whaddya talkin' about?
KYLE
Phone's dead. Just tried to make a
call.
BOB
You're shittin' me.
Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.
SANDRA
Oh, this is just great.
BOB
Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to
get excited about. Probably just
working on the lines.
(MORE)
24.
BOB (cont'd)
Sides, I'm sure Jeep'll have your
truck fixed up quick as can be, and
then you'll be on your way.
A JINGLE as the old lady enters. She surveys the scene as if
feasting on paradise. Maybe her eyes aren't so good.
CHARLIE
Have a seat wherever you want,
Ma'am. Specials are on the board.
OLD WOMAN
Thank you, dear.
The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons.
She smiles at them pleasantly.
Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:
OLD WOMAN
Oh, I already know what I want.
CHARLIE
Okay, what'll it be?
25.
OLD WOMAN
I'll have the steak, please.
CHARLIE
And how'd you like that cooked?
OLD WOMAN
Rare if you would. And water, no
ice.
CHARLIE
Coming right up.
OLD WOMAN
Charlie, is it?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
OLD WOMAN
What an unusual name for a girl.
CHARLIE
So they say. I'll be right back
with your water.
The old lady turns to the Andersons.
OLD WOMAN
Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.
SANDRA
Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm
Sandra and this is my husband
Howard.
GLADYS
What a nice young couple you are.
What brings you out to these parts?
SANDRA
We're moving out to Scottsdale.
But our truck broke down, and so
we're stuck here while it's being
fixed.
GLADYS
Oh, what a nuisance.
A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head.
She doesn't seem
to notice it.
SANDRA
Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are
down around here. The phone and
TV, you know?
(MORE)
26.
SANDRA (cont'd)
And I just was wondering if you
might have heard something on your
way up? You know, about what's
going on?
Gladys smiles strangely.
GLADYS
Oh, don't worry yourself about
that, sweetheart. It'll all be
over soon.
Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that
response.
The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S
FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the
least.
Howard and Sandra exchange looks.
Creepy.
The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a
quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one
eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the
Andersons. Something about her...
JEEP
The carburetor's shot.
Don't know
why. Looks brand new.
BOB
(glances over at the
ANDERSONS)
Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed.
JEEP
I could try to rebuild it, but it'd
take a while, and I don't think we
have all the parts. If we call
right now, we might be able to get
a new one down here tomorrow
morning.
BOB
That's not gonna happen.
Goddamn
phone's out.
JEEP
What?
Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front
of Gladys.
GLADYS
Thank you, dear. How far along are
you?
27.
Charlie rests a hand on her belly.
CHARLIE
Just about there.
GLADYS
The father must be very proud.
CHARLIE
I wouldn't know.
GLADYS
You mean he's...
CHARLIE
Out of sight. Out of mind.
GLADYS
Oh, I see.
So you're not married,
I take it?
A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it
away. But another one lands in its place.
CHARLIE
Nope.
Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real
ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.
More
FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food.
Charlie is still trying to wave them away.
GLADYS
That's too bad.
CHARLIE
No, I prefer it that way. I don't
a need a man tellin' me what to do.
GLADYS
But what about the baby?
CHARLIE
I've got it under control.
GLADYS
Yeah, but it's gonna burn.
Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.
Kyle
glances over from the counter.
CHARLIE
What did you just say?
28.
GLADYS
(all smiles)
I said your fucking baby's gonna
burn.
Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.
CHARLIE
Go to hell, lady.
She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward
the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.
BOB
What happened?
CHARLIE
Total fucking Jesus freak.
Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour
her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are
swarming now. How did so many get in here?
Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of
events.
GLADYS
All those babies.
They're gonna
burn.
SANDRA
Gladys, please. There's no reason
to --
Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.
GLADYS
Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt!
All you do is complain! Complain!
Complain!
Sandra covers her mouth in shock.
Everybody in the diner is
now focused on the old lady.
Howard gets up from the booth.
SANDRA
Howard, it's okay!
Don't listen to
her!
But Howard's already standing over Gladys.
HOWARD
Who the hell do you think you are,
lady?! Now, I'd like you to
apologize to my --
29.
GLADYS LUNGES AT HOWARD AND TAKES A MONSTROUS BITE OUT OF HIS
NECK! SHE PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A MOUTH FILLED WITH TINY
RAZOR SHARP TEETH.
EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor.
Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over.
Blood
covers her face and chest.
GLADYS
You're all going to fucking die!
Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he
whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head
sideways. THWACK!
BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.
Impossibly, Gladys is
still standing.
She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE
DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake.
Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.
BOB
Don't move!
But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING
WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB!
Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast,
as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --
UPSIDE DOWN!
BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't
track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in
the ceiling, a rain of plaster.
Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.
BOB
(struggles to cock the
GUN)
Fuck!
Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE
ROOM!
The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He
snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face
him.
PERCY
Shoot her, Jeep!
Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.
30.
GLADYS
(a sickly sweet smile)
You'll never save her.
Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear
paralyzing him where he stands.
PERCY
SHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH!
Gladys rockets straight at him!
But Jeep's too afraid to move.
He clamps his eyes shut,
bracing himself for the end.
BLAM!
BLAM!
BLAM!
A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an
animal.
Jeep slowly opens his eyes.
His gun's still cocked.
Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet.
He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his
silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so
shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing
such serious heat.
SANDRA (O.S.)
Somebody help me!
Sandra is on the floor with her husband.
Blood pours freely
from his neck.
Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --
then he rushes to help.
KYLE
Press your hands over the hole!
Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his
hand.
KYLE
Don't look at me like that, lady!
I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you!
Now put your goddamn hands over the
hole before your husband bleeds to
death!
Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck,
desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out
between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid
kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.
31.
A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to
his feet.
BOB
The fuck was that?!
What the fuck
was that!?
Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her
knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult
facade giving way to that of a frightened child
A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and
see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An
ungodly horror.
Howard lies in the back seat. Sandra by his head, clasping
his hands in hers. Audrey by his feet. Percy rides shotgun.
Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition.
The engine ROARS to life.
Kyle grips the wheel.
Picking up speed.
KYLE
How far to the hospital?
PERCY
Seventy, maybe eighty miles.
Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor
time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat.
AUDREY
What's that on the road?
Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally
closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL.
32.
KYLE
They're fuckin' clouds!
What the
fuck do they look like?
AUDREY
Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz.
She's right.
They're black... Undulating... BUZZING!
PING!
PING!
PING!
Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield --
SPLAT!
And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds.
THEY'RE FLIES!
The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by
insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED
bug guts. Driving blind!
The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening!
Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them...
Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of
light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like
he's about to puke or faint.
BOB
I don't understand how she was
still standin' after Percy hit `er
with that goddamn fryin' pan.
Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it.
I swear I did.
(BEAT)
And did you see that kid's gun?
The hell's he doin' with a gun like
that?
Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling.
BOB
It's okay, Jeep.
It's okay.
But for Jeep it's not okay.
He's hurting real bad inside.
JEEP
I couldn't pull the trigger. I
froze. I saw what I needed to do,
but I was afraid...
(breaks down)
She could've killed you!
(MORE)
33.
JEEP (cont'd)
Or Charlie...She would've killed me
if it wasn't for...
He can't get the words out.
Bob rests a hand on his boy's
shoulder.
BOB
There's nothin' to be ashamed of,
Jeep.
(BEAT)
Not everybody can play the hero.
Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front
DOOR JINGLE.
Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and
Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling,
gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help.
Percy races for the back.
BOB
(catching Percy by the
ARM)
Where you going?!
PERCY
To get my bible!
BOB
The hell you need that for?!
PERCY
Well somebody's gotta start
prayin'...
Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING.
Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the
SOLID UNDULATING BLACK CURTAIN OF FLIES SURROUNDING THE TRUCK
STOP'S PERIMETER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT.
Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the
day's remaining sunlight filters through the swarm.
Apocalyptic.
No one breathes.
CUT TO:
34.
A BLACK HAND AND A HOOK TEAR A SHIRT OPEN
Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to
the bone.
Percy and Charlie are tending to Howard. Sandra is holding
her husband's hand, trying to comfort him, while Audrey
watches from a distance with grim fascination.
PERCY
(raises a bottle of
ALCOHOL)
Okay, hold `em steady.
CHARLIE
(nods, peakish, to
HERSELF)
Oh god, please don't throw up.
Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound.
Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook.
Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the
tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle
stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body --
just in case.
Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles
from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from
Percy's frying pan.
BOB
She's cold as a freakin' ice cube.
If I hadn't just seen her walk in
here, I'd say the old bag's been
dead for hours.
Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged
mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.
KYLE
Well, I don't care how long she's
been dead, the bitch ain't stayin'
in here with us.
Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car.
CHARLIE
Oh, thank God, the police!
Frantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of
the door, sealing off the entrance.
Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields.
Window blinds are snap closed.
THE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Jeep races in, locks the back door.
Then he pushes a desk in
front of it.
IN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS
The place is transformed. Locked up tight.
The ROAR OF
ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER.
Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap.
She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to
keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss.
HOWARD
Sandra?
What's happening?
SANDRA
It's okay!
Everything's okay!
Sandra closes her eyes.
Struggling to believe it.
Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into
DARKNESS.
43.
We hear CRIES OF ALARM.
TOTAL BLACK.
Chaos.
BOB (V.O.)
Jeep, get the flashlights!
PERCY (V.O.)
Everybody just stay still!
KYLE (V.O.)
Now that we're locked in here, what
the fuck are we supposed to do?
A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH
THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face.
Michael looks up at the ceiling.
Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the
MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. If only he could
stop shaking, it might be believable.
Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the
windows. The ICE CREAM TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS fan across the
diner.
Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows.
Charlie stops next to Jeep. Senses him shaking. Rests a
hand on his arm. And that seems to help...a little.
Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE.
HOWARD
Oh, honey, listen.
It's the Ice
Cream Man.
45.
Hiding in the shadows... listening to sounds of WAR just
outside.
Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears.
A few feet away,
Audrey clutches a butcher's knife.
Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another.
Trying to
keep it together.
Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the
handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS
rattle the plates on the shelves.
Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the
front windows.
Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds.
Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face.
Staring.
ON CHARLIE staring at the window.
CLOSER.
Charlie's eyes go
wide as --
SMASH!
A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window.
Glass,
sand and dust swirl in.
Audrey and Sandra SCREAM.
Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready.
Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically
for the intruder. It's so dark!
JEEP
Where is it?!
Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She
looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's
too much.
AUDREY
Mom!
Open your eyes!
SANDRA
I can't!
I can't!
Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's
got hold of his legs!
That gets Sandra's eyes open!
SANDRA
(springing after her
HUSBAND)
Howard!
Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through
the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about,
desperately trying to grab a hold of something.
Sandra scrambles after her husband.
Reaching for him.
AUDREY
Daddy!
The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's
outstretched hands. She has him!
The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered
window.
It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light
falling across its face, reveals:
A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age.
Her skin is a deathly
blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.
50.
Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated
flesh on her arms, neck and face. The self-inflicted wounds
of a drug addict. Her voice is not QUITE HUMAN.
TEENAGE GIRL
See what you made me do, mother!?
Sandra screams, holds on.
SANDRA
No!
Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's
arms.
Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but
with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he
discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms.
Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched.
A human
tug-of-war.
ON HOWARD'S FEET -- TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE
CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS.
Howard's body lurches further out the window.
SANDRA
Howard!
Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie
daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain
leverage.
ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS
ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM!
Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window,
losing her grip on Howard's belt.
Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY
LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to
his baby girl.
RAGGEDY MAN
(SWEETLY)
There you are!
And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures
suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she
alone was their target.
Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie,
grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through.
51.
Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer.
Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the
window.
AUDREY
Daddy!
Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death
through the window. Jeep's losing her!
A FLASH OF STEEL.
SCHING!
Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like
hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to
their owners.
Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a
machine gun in the other. He lights up everything in his
path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures
SCREECH and flee into the night, having successfully taken
their first victim.
Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and
Jeep scoot away from the window.
Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going
after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it out.
SANDRA
Let me go!
He's alive!
Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from
the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.
SANDRA
He's alive!
MICHAEL
No...
Not anymore.
Sandra breaks down.
52.
As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain.
She
clutches her belly. Winces.
Jeep catches her arm to steady her.
CHARLIE
(RECOVERING)
I'm okay. I'm fine.
She glances back at Michael.
He's watching her.
Those eyes.
CHARLIE
Thanks...
MICHAEL
I told you not to do anything
brave.
Charlie doesn't know how to respond.
She's about to say
something when --
Kyle rushes into the room.
A smile on his face.
KYLE
We got `em runnin'!
Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his
excitement falling.
KYLE
Where's Howard?
No one responds.
Sandra and Audrey are huddled together.
Crying.
Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the
adrenaline.
MICHAEL
Someone needs to be on the roof.
KYLE
I'll go.
Bob grabs Kyle's arm.
BOB
Hold on.
(approaches Michael,
DETERMINED)
You better start talking.
All eyes on Michael.
These people want answers.
Finally:
53.
MICHAEL
The first time God lost faith in
Man he sent a flood. The second
time...he sent what you see
outside.
Everyone takes that in for a moment, then:
PERCY
You sayin' this is the
Apocalypse...?
MICHAEL
I'm saying this is an
extermination.
(BEAT)
Those things out there are vessels.
The Possessed. The weakest willed
are the easiest to turn.
KYLE
Possessed by what?
Demons?
MICHAEL
No...by angels.
That silences the room.
PERCY
(pulls out his bible)
Son, I don't know what bible you
been readin', but in my version,
the angels are the good guys.
Michael looks squarely at Percy.
MICHAEL
That's where your book is wrong.
SANDRA
How come you know so much about
them?
MICHAEL
I know because until last night, I
was on their side.
JEEP
You mean you're...
Michael considers Jeep, then:
MICHAEL
Not anymore...
54.
BOB
Right and yesterday I was the
fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know,
fuck this. I don't even believe in
God.
MICHAEL
That's fine, because He doesn't
believe in you either.
Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.
PERCY
C'mon, Bob. Have you looked
outside recently? Those aren't
exactly our regular customers out
there.
BOB
How do we know he didn't bring them
here himself?
CHARLIE
He brings them here and then he
saves us from them? You're a
genius, Bob.
Bob falls silent, confounded.
Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.
AUDREY
So you're here to protect us?
MICHAEL
Not you...
(looks at Charlie)
Her.
Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.
CHARLIE
Me?!
Why me?!
MICHAEL
Because your child is the only hope
humanity has of surviving.
In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can
do when told such a thing. She LAUGHS.
CHARLIE
No way!
But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes
genuine fear.
55.
CHARLIE
(STUNNED)
Jesus Christ...
MICHAEL
Exactly.
Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is
starting to make sense.
JEEP
You're sayin' she's the mother of
the Messiah?
BOB
Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed
to be a vi--
CHARLIE
Go fuck yourself, Bob!
PERCY
Makes you wonder about Mary.
CHARLIE
(approaches Michael, panic
setting in)
Look, this is not possible! I'm
just a waitress! I'm nobody! I
can't give birth to the Savior of
Mankind!
(and finally)
I don't even own a car!
MICHAEL
None of that matters anymore.
Either your child lives or Mankind
dies.
KYLE
So what, we're supposed to just
hold those things off until Mary
over there squeezes one out?
MICHAEL
That's right.
CHARLIE
That can't be. I'm only eight
months pregnant.
KYLE
Oh we're fucked.
We are so fucked!
56.
SANDRA
How are we supposed to survive here
for a month?
MICHAEL
We won't have to...
At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.
CHARLIE
It's coming soon, isn't it?
Michael nods.
Charlie sways on her feet.
Jeep rests a hand on her
shoulder, steadying her.
With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group
with finality.
MICHAEL
If you want to live you'll do what
I say. This first attack was a
test of our strength. The next one
will be a test of our weakness.
(BEAT)
Something much worse is on its way.
Everyone exchanges terrified looks.
Finally, Kyle steps
forward.
KYLE
Okay, what's your plan?
MICHAEL
We'll keep watch on the roof in
shifts of two. Jeep, go get some
tools. We need to close up this
window before somebody else goes
out.
Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he
follows after Michael, leaving Charlie to stare at the
SHATTERED WINDOW, the blinds flipping wildly in the wind.
Percy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides. They're
wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from
the cold and the flies.
Percy scans the horizon.
Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the
darkness.
57.
PERCY
They're out there. Sons of
bitches. I can feel `em.
(BEAT)
Damn it's cold!
Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands"
together to keep them warm. Kyle notices. Sees the dog
tags.
KYLE
You were in the Army?
PERCY
Navy, two tours. But the second
one didn't work out so well, so I
didn't get to go back for a third.
Suppose that makes me lucky in a
way. Served with Bob, you know.
That's how I ended up in this
place.
KYLE
What was it like?
Being in a war?
PERCY
Dark.
Like this.
Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45.
Nervously switches
it from hand to hand.
PERCY
So what's with that gun?
KYLE
What?
PERCY
Your piece. The one you killed
grandma with. Don't reckon it's
for huntin' buck.
KYLE
No. I uh -- keep it for
protection.
PERCY
Protection from what?
KYLE
From people.
Percy looks at him skeptically.
PERCY
People.
58.
KYLE
Yeah, people who might try to give
me a hard time, you know?
PERCY
Just regular people or uh...
KYLE
Yeah, well, no, not regular,
regular people.
PERCY
Irregular people then.
KYLE
I'm talkin' people whose job it is
to give other people a hard time.
Kinda person who doesn't get enough
fiber in their diet, you know what
I'm sayin?
PERCY
So it's a work thing, is it?
KYLE
Exactly.
Strictly business.
PERCY
This business of yours... You like
it?
Kyle's eyes narrow.
KYLE
Who the fuck are you to be sweatin'
me, man? I got my reasons for
doin' what I do.
Percy just stares at him, penetrating.
Finally:
PERCY
When I was a kid my father would
sit by my bed every night before
I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me,
Percy, if you don't wake up
tomorrow, if it turns out that
today was your last day on earth,
would you be proud of what you've
done in this life? Cuz if you
ain't, then you better start
gettin' square.
Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to
the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.
CUT TO:
59.
THE SILVER ZIPPO
rolls between dirty fingers.
Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up
some steaks with the other. He pauses in his cooking every
few moments to take a slug from a can of beer. Can't get it
down fast enough.
Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a
prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread
around.
Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls
another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and
places it in front of her.
BOB
On the house.
She looks up at him.
Smiles weakly.
Takes a sip.
SANDRA
Thanks.
BOB
You hungry?
SANDRA
Couldn't eat if my life depended on
it.
BOB
Well I figure just cuz the world's
coming to an end, it doesn't mean a
man's gotta starve. All I can say
is thank heavens they left the gas
on.
Sandra takes another sip of beer.
Considers it.
SANDRA
Never much cared for beer.
Howard's the beer drinker in the
family.
The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her
again. She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses
them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. This
is a battle she's losing.
60.
Meanwhile in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling
with Percy's old radio. Back and forth on the dial.
Listening for anything. Nothing but STATIC.
Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael
nail broken table planks across the shattered window. He
eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two
jagged wounds visible above his shirt line.
JEEP
What did you do...you know, before
you came here...?
Michael considers the question a beat, then:
MICHAEL
I was a soldier, a general, in His
army.
JEEP
Well, what changed?
What made you
leave?
MICHAEL
I was given an order I didn't
believe in...
(off Jeep's look:)
He lost faith. I hadn't.
Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.
JEEP
So what happens to you...after this
is over?
Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:
MICHAEL
Sometimes we have to face the thing
we fear the most in order to be
free of it.
Michael picks up his gun.
MICHAEL
It's almost time for the next
shift.
Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him,
deep in thought.
CUT TO:
61.
Sandra awakens with a start.
SANDRA
Howard?
But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is
still asleep. The drugs have started to wear off... and her
fear is returning.
Sandra splashes water on her face.
Stares at herself in the
mirror. A living wreck.
Sandra steps out of the bathroom.
VOICE
(a whisper)
Sandra...
Sandra freezes.
SANDRA
Who's there?
A beat then:
VOICE
Sandra...
Sandra spins around.
Searching.
62.
SANDRA
Howard?
Is that you?
It sure sounded like Howard.
VOICE
Help me...
Please...
This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from.
Sandra
turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it.
Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door.
VOICE
(from behind the door)
Help me. Sandra...
Sandra is stricken.
What the hell is she going to do?
That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door.
She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see
out.
SANDRA'S POV:
Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door.
NAILED
TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS.
But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible
black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are
breathing.
Sandra goes slack with horror.
HOWARD
Help me, please!
Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES
covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.
SANDRA
Howard!
Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it
away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when
Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.
AUDREY
Mom!
Kyle races to restrain Sandra.
SANDRA
Let me go!
He's alive!
63.
She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags
Kyle in the face. Down he goes.
Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her.
The SHOUTING from the back office awakens the rest of the
sleepers. Percy springs up. Charlie is shaking Jeep.
Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey
hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy
appears in the doorway.
Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and
that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION.
Howard is there.
A few feet away.
Alive.
Sandra races toward him.
Just behind her comes Percy.
SANDRA
Howard!
And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL --
-- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying
streams of dark fluid toward Sandra --
-- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her
from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not
stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door
SLAMMING closed behind them.
Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into
the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground.
But she's not fighting anymore.
Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his
back to the door, breathing heavily.
64.
CHARLIE
Percy?
He takes a step forward, then falls to ground.
The entire back side of his body is gone.
Burned away.
CUT TO:
A SHEET
covering a body.
Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it
looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never
know.
Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael
never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at
her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father
making sure his child hasn't strayed too far.
In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains
her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio.
Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.
65.
She brings her ear up close.
Wait.
Is that a VOICE?
She adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into
focus. CLEARER.
AUDREY
Hey...
CLEARER.
Yes.
It's a VOICE!
AUDREY
Hey! You guys, I think I got
something here!
Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around
the radio.
THROUGH THE HAZE OF STATIC, A GRAVELY, TIRED VOICE.
STRAINED
BEYOND BELIEF. BUT STILL BROADCASTING.
RADIO VOICE
... battling has been fierce. The
numbers of casualties are unknown
but all indications are that they
must be unimaginably large.
(BEAT)
If you're just joining us, we're
getting some of the first bits of
good news, if you can call it that,
since this apocalypse began just
twenty-four ago. A human militia
has formed on the outskirts of Las
Vegas and has begun to engage the
enemy. Also down in the Four
Corners area, we've been receiving
unconfirmed reports of another
resistance force gathering in Red
Rock National in the northern
Mojave Desert area.
JEEP
Red Rock...
CHARLIE
That can't be more than an hour up
the highway from here.
AUDREY
Does that mean we can leave?
MICHAEL
No.
We're not going anywhere.
BOB
What the hell are you talkin'
about? This is our chance!
66.
MICHAEL
We can't risk being on the move
when the child comes. It's too
dangerous.
Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated. She shakes her head,
anger building. She sweeps some plates off the counter and
races for the bathroom.
RADIO VOICE
... And as we fight this new
enemy, may God give us the strength
to survive and show mercy for those
of us who are already lost...
CUT TO:
A CIGARETTE
being lit.
Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water
running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag,
feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant.
Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her
hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her
eyes, fear and anger overtaking her.
She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration.
It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie,
wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought.
JEEP (O.S.)
Guess it's your turn not to sleep.
Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her.
CHARLIE
Hey...
Jeep sees the strain on her face.
JEEP
You okay?
67.
CHARLIE
You mean besides the fact that I
just found out that I'm the mother
of the Messiah?
Jeep smiles, nods.
CHARLIE
Crazy thing is...I didn't want this
baby. I even went down to the
clinic, you know that?
(off Jeep's reaction:)
I remember sitting there in the
waiting room, absolutely sure I was
doin' the right thing...And that's
when the feeling started. Like I
was falling into the deepest,
darkest hole imaginable. I
couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak.
I kept thinking this must be what
death is like. And when finally
they called my name, I ran.
(BEAT)
For a while after that I tried
pretending that it was just cold
feet, that I could go back if I
wanted to, that I could decide to
end it like I'd planned. Then I'd
start to have that feeling again
and I knew I didn't have a choice.
Somehow this had already been
decided. And it made me hate this
thing that's been growing inside
me.
A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:
JEEP
You shouldn't say things like that,
Charlie. It isn't right. You'll
get through this. I know you will.
She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:
CHARLIE
How come you have so much faith in
me, Jeep? God knows I've never
given you or anybody else a reason
to. Or is it that you just can't
find any other hard-luck case to
follow around?
Jeep's face hardens.
He gets up.
Hurt.
Frustrated.
68.
JEEP
You know, you're not the only who's
suffered, okay? Let me know when
you stop feeling sorry for
yourself.
And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare
after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.
CUT TO:
All at once the entire diner COMES BACK TO LIFE.
The jukebox WHIRS ON, filling the room with Merle Haggard's
"I'm a Lonesome Fugitive".
Bob's TV glows with bright rolling STATIC.
The electric fan spins on above the grill.
70.
Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the
window.
Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw.
Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light.
BOB
We back in business?
MICHAEL
I don't think so.
The group gathered at the window sees Kyle racing out toward
the pumps.
BOB
Jesus Christ, what the hell is that
boy doin'!
CHARLIE
We have to get `im back in here!
Bob springs into action.
Pushes the booth away from the
front door.
The sound of a gun COCKING.
Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.
MICHAEL
Don't. You open that door and we
could all be dead.
Bob kicks over a table in disgust.
BOB
Damn it all to hell!
CHARLIE
Oh, no.
Audrey...
Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and
run towards Kyle.
Panic.
Charlie rushes to Michael's side.
CHARLIE
Do you have no heart?!
She's just
a kid!
But he's immovable.
CHARLIE
You can't let her die!
(grabbing a gun from the
TABLE)
I swear if you don't do something,
I will!
Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door.
MICHAEL
Wait.
75.
Charlie looks back at him, defiant.
No one breathes.
Then:
MICHAEL
(raising his guns)
Open the door.
Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the
dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed
Charlie and out into hell.
Everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing.
Audrey is the first one in.
Michael is almost there.
But the fire is faster, ENGULFING
HIM IN FLAME!
CHARLIE
Michael!
BOB
(pulling Charlie away from
the door)
Get back!
BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into
the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF
FIRE REACHES THEM.
Everyone hits the deck as the FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS
covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey.
Michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess.
Jeep and Bob
rush to pat him down.
Audrey's coughing from the smoke.
CHARLIE
I'll get some water!
Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink.
She fills up
a pitcher of water.
She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher...
And SCREAMS!
The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her
wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE.
The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor.
The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress
outfit covering her pregnant belly.
Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She
frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.
77.
But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room
to maneuver.
YOUNG BOY
C'mon, don't be scared. I just
wanna play with your baby.
That's it.
She's backed against the end of the counter!
The boy raises the knife to strike.
Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in
front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN.
CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's
hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the
blade.
The knife CLATTERS to the ground.
The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but
there's no knife.
Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his
THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps.
Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the
boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her.
Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie,
guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.
MICHAEL
Are you hurt?
Charlie shakes her head no.
CHARLIE
Where is he?!
That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE
DINER BACK INTO DARKNESS.
JEEP'S VOICE
He's still in here!
FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner.
LIGHTING under chairs.
Under tables.
BOB'S VOICE
Where the fuck is he?!
A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST.
Everybody spins to track
the location of the sound.
78.
As soon as they move in one direction, the SCAMPERING is
heard in another.
Jeep's LIGHT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE GROUND.
A TRAIL OF
BLOOD.
JEEP
He's bleeding!
THE BEAMS OF LIGHT JOIN TOGETHER, MOVING FAST TO TRACK THE
BLOOD ACROSS THE DINER WHERE IT ENDS AT...
A WALL...
Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE TRAIL OF BLOOD
REACHES THE CEILING AND...STOPS.
BOB
What the fuck?
SCREECH!
THE BLOODY BOY SPRINGS OFF A TABLE BEHIND THEM AND
LANDS ON BOB'S BACK.
Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly
strong arms away from his neck.
JEEP
Dad!
Jeep can't get a clear shot.
Bob's gasping for air.
Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's
back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.
MICHAEL
Get ready!
Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked
creature into the air.
Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF
GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner.
And then in moments...
All is QUIET.
BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.
She
WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach.
CHARLIE
Oh, no!
Michael lowers his flashlight.
CLEAR FLUID runs down
Charlie's legs.
CUT TO:
79.
Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with
Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her
legs. Pots of steaming water surround them.
AUDREY
What am I supposed to do? Just
`cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I
automatically know how to do this!
MICHAEL
Just do as I say.
AUDREY
Yeah, but, how do you know how to
do this?!
Michael reacts to the sound. An urgency comes over him.
Audrey arrives with more steaming water.
AUDREY
What is that?!
MICHAEL
He's coming. We have to hurry.
AUDREY
Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry?
This isn't something you can
exactly hurry, is it?
MICHAEL
Charlie, I need you to push. I
need you to push as hard as you
can.
AUDREY
Michael, who's coming?!
Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with
pain. It's a gruesome, bloody affair. It's getting close.
MICHAEL
We're almost there...
81.
Amidst the dirt and darkness, Charlie lets out a final
agonizing SCREAM...
...and then comes a BABY'S CRIES.
Audrey, eyes wide, holds
up the CHILD. Stunned. Elated.
AUDREY
Oh my god...we did it!
Charlie,
you did it!
Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the
baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace
it or be terrified by it. A commitment she's not yet ready
to make, even at this late hour.
AUDREY
(CONFUSED)
It's okay. The baby's okay.
Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face.
CHARLIE
I don't...I...
Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.
MICHAEL
Take him... Give her a minute.
Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to
soothe him by pacing around the diner.
82.
AUDREY
It's okay...It's okay...Shhh...
Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS.
Menacing.
Closer.
Audrey
reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio,
trying
to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out
of the
STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing
SILENT
NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm.
Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up.
She stares
at him, a burning spite in her eyes.
CHARLIE
So are we safe now?
Is it over?
MICHAEL
No. Killing the child would have
ended the war before it had begun.
Now, at least, he will have a
chance to grow up, a chance to lead
the world out of darkness.
Those words provide her little comfort.
CHARLIE
And what happens until then...?
MICHAEL
You'll need to teach him how.
Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.
CHARLIE
What makes you think I can do that?
What makes you think I want to do
that? If he's so important, why
don't you take him?
MICHAEL
Each of us has a burden. This one
is yours and yours alone. Maybe
someday you'll understand what that
means.
Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey
approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. Despite
how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to
see her in such a demoralized state.
AUDREY
Mama? Can you hear me?
(holds up the baby)
We did it...The baby's alive.
(MORE)
83.
AUDREY (cont'd)
(BEAT)
Mama?
If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face.
Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her
mother. But we HOLD here and...
DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are
loosening the bonds. BLOOD TRICKLES from where the rope's
cut through her skin.
Jeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie
to her feet, while Audrey continues to pace, the bundle of
bloody blankets cradled in her arms.
JEEP
Something's happening.
They're
moving away.
84.
MICHAEL
The Possessed can't come near the
child, so He sent someone that can.
Someone like me.
BOB
Who?
MICHAEL
Gabriel. My lieutenant.
He's come
to do what I wouldn't.
ON JEEP as the realization hits him.
JEEP
Your orders...
Michael looks at Jeep.
JEEP
You were the one who was supposed
to kill the baby? That was the
order you didn't obey.
Michael nods grimly.
Charlie looks urgently at Michael.
CHARLIE
What's he talking about?
The baby CRIES LOUDER.
CHARLIE
Michael, what the hell's he talking
about?!
MICHAEL
There was never meant to be a
Second Coming. But we've just
changed that. The child lives.
The future is unwritten. There's
still hope.
Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.
CHARLIE
Audrey...?
Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...
...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND
SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS!
Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door.
Hers is the face of madness.
85.
SANDRA
Stay away from me!
Don't come any
closer!
AUDREY
Mom!
BOB
Don't do it, lady!
SANDRA
You heard what he said. They just
want the baby. Maybe if we just
give it to them, then they'll let
us go!
Michael cocks his gun.
Points it at Sandra.
THE HORN BLARES ONCE MORE, DEAFENING, SHAKING EVERYTHING IN
THE DINER. IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes.
CHARLIE
Give him to me!
SANDRA
Why?! You never wanted him in the
first place!
Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words
rattling her to the very core.
CHARLIE
No...
I...
Sandra is almost to the front door.
SANDRA
It's just one baby.
Just one.
CRASH!
THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES.
A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner.
Sandra is blinded.
She raises a hand to block the light.
And that's when Michael fires.
BLAM!
Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her
forehead, and...
...THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS!
Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION...
And
everything suddenly goes very QUIET.
86.
Michael fires again.
Blowing Sandra's body back through the
doorway.
Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air.
The time for Jeep to act is now!
Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere
inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see...
The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the
spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS.
Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the
diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before.
This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle
scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly
insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather
they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine.
The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision.
And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his
striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake them
for brothers.
His name is GABRIEL.
Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical
looking MACE in his powerful hands.
And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the
mace arcing down at Jeep.
Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the
floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND.
Gabriel brings the mace up again.
Jeep won't be so lucky
twice.
BOB (O.S.)
Sonuvabitch!
Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing.
Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching
himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind
him.
But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run
with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the
child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she
pulls the child protectively to her chest.
87.
Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around
like a deadly, RAZOR SHARP FAN!
Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face.
His gun falling from his hands.
Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.
JEEP
No!
With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the
diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the
stove.
Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into
the fray.
MICHAEL
No, Jeep! You must protect the
child now!
JEEP
Me?!
What about you?
MICHAEL
My path ends here. You are the
true protector. You always have
been.
Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.
JEEP
But I don't know what to do!
MICHAEL
Find the Prophets.
Learn to read
the instructions.
Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face
Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words.
JEEP
Prophets? What Prophets?
What
instructions?!
And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to
Michael's Police Cruiser.
Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the
baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes
his hand around the keys, determination building.
JEEP
C'mon!
88.
Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray.
CHARLIE
Wait!
We can't leave him!
JEEP
We have no choice!
We have to get
to Red Rock!
He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office.
Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the
ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood.
Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched
hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a
BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove.
Jeep is terrified.
JEEP
Dad!
Jeep tries to help him up.
BOB
Leave me, Jeep.
My place is here,
remember?
JEEP
But Dad...!
Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:
BOB
Run.
And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.
Audrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door.
Charlie opens it.
Sand swirls in around her.
And Jeep leads the trio out the door.
Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like
enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible
family conflict.
89.
MICHAEL
I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You
were always so eager to please Him.
GABRIEL
Unlike you...the rebellious son.
(noticing Michael's scars)
Pity about your wings. They would
have helped you now.
MICHAEL
To not feel their burden...is a
dream.
GABRIEL
You think you can defy Him and not
pay the price?
MICHAEL
The child lives. What happens to
me doesn't matter now.
GABRIEL
Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You
can help them sneak out the back
door, but they won't escape.
(BEAT)
And neither will you, brother.
Michael slowly approaches Gabriel.
MICHAEL
(SOFT)
I'm not running anymore.
Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face.
This was not
what he was expecting.
MICHAEL
(SENSING)
Join with me. You don't need do
this. There's another way.
A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens.
GABRIEL
There is no other way...
He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! --
LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it
wasn't bad-ass enough.
And the fight begins.
90.
It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems
under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior
weapon.
With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering
speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The
place is getting absolutely shot to hell.
Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings
the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches.
Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to
fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight
into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in
Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he
lands on the counter.
Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest,
sending him fluttering back.
Michael thrusts himself to his feet.
Gabriel recovers, jabs
again.
Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support
and lifts his body just above the deadly spike.
Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him.
Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of
punches.
Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.
He clumsily lifts
his mace and thrusts with it.
Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a
wall.
Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones.
A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing
back, losing his grip on the weapon.
Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back.
Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael
off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking
the life out of Gabriel.
Jeep frantically tries to get the right key into the
ignition.
It's in.
Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP.
Panic.
CHARLIE
Come on, Jeep!
JEEP
I'm trying!
Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING.
A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light
catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a
SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely
distended.
Charlie screams.
JEEP
Fuck!
Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE!
The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass
JEEP
(throwing the car in
REVERSE)
Hang on!
Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards
toward the highway.
BUT THE CREATURE HANGS ON!
Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full
180 onto the road.
THE CREATURE SHOOTS OFF THE CAR AND HITS THE ASPHALT.
Jeep throws it in drive just as the POSSESSED SANTA rises
from the pavement.
Pedal to the metal.
92.
The creature doesn't have a chance as the cruiser PLOWS into
him.
BONES CRUNCH as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over
the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a
cloud of dust.
Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor.
JEEP
Okay, we need to figure out our
weapon situation.
Hopefully
Michael didn't take everything out
of the car.
Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a
police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie
searches under her seat.
Pulls out a...GRENADE.
CHARLIE
Is this what I think it is?
JEEP
Yes. Now just put it down...
Slowly.
Charlie places it onto the seat.
Audrey fishes around in the backseat.
AUDREY
(holding up each item)
Okay, all I got is a flare gun
thing. Looks like we got a box of
flares to go with it.
JEEP
Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A
a flare gun... And a grenade.
Alright.
(hands Charlie the Glock)
Load this.
(BEAT)
Audrey, can you figure out how to
load that flare gun without killing
us all?
AUDREY
I can try.
JEEP
Try real hard, okay?
Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun.
93.
Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael.
He
fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent.
Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't
hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom.
Unbelievably Michael is still holding on.
Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom
mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael.
Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner.
Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull.
Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more.
It's a brutal
struggle.
Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms
reach.
He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this
angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's
strength is giving way. Michael is winning.
Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the
mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go
wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them
both through.
Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward.
Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest.
Right
through his heart.
Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly
as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood
left in this guy.
Michael falls to his knees.
Weakening.
Gabriel looms over Michael.
Michael looks up at him, blood
leaking from his mouth.
GABRIEL
You always wanted to live like one
of them...Now you'll know how it
feels to die like one of them.
Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head.
Michael closes his eyes.
Submitting.
The mace comes swinging down...
94.
The cruiser hits the FLY STORM. Black. Nothing is visible
beyond the windows. BUZZING surrounds them. DEAFENING.
Jeep turns on the windshield wipers.
Hits the brights.
PING!
PING!
PING!
Driving blind!
ON THE SPEEDOMETER as their speed slows to a crawl.
AUDREY
Go faster!
JEEP
I can't fuckin' see!
Charlie's desperately trying to soothe her SCREAMING baby.
ON THE AIR VENTS as FLIES start crawling in.
JEEP
Oh, no.
Gabriel is looking down upon Michael's broken body.
Something is happening to his skin. The DARK WRITING THAT
COVERS HIS BODY is beginning UN-WRITE itself and DISAPPEAR...
Charlie is struggling to close the air vents to stop the
inflow of BUZZING insects. It's not working!
She looks to Jeep in desperation, but something more
frightening catches her attention.
The INTRICATE WRITING is beginning to appear on Jeep's arm,
snaking its way up from his wrists like VINES.
CHARLIE
Jeep, your arm!
Jeep sees it, eyes go wide.
CHARLIE
What is it?
A beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words...
95.
JEEP
The instructions...
Gabriel watches as the last of the writing FADES from
Michael's body when he hears a faint CLICKING sound from
somewhere in the diner.
Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward
the source of the CLICKING.
He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive
pool of blood.
It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING
sound is coming from Bob's SILVER ZIPPO.
Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to
lighting that lighter. CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...
Bob looks at Gabriel.
BOB
Sorry...
We're closed.
And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO
IGNITES.
Gabriel's eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME DANCES in front of
the stove's broken gas line.
Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes.
A STREAM OF FIRE ENGULFS HIM AS HIS WINGS UNFOLD AND HE LEAPS
INTO AWESOME FIERY FLIGHT.
The MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the slow moving vehicle.
In the rearview mirror, Jeep sees the CLOUD OF FIRE
MUSHROOMING UP in the sky behind them. It's eerily
magnificent.
CHARLIE
The swarm, it's fading!
Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the FLY SWARM
suddenly dissipates all around them, revealing a CLEAR VIEW
of the highway ahead. Jeep knows at what price this good
fortune has come.
96.
JEEP
Thank you...
AND THAT'S WHEN THE WORD "PARADISE" CRASHES DOWN LIKE A BALL
OF FIRE ONTO THE ROAD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM!
JEEP
Oh, shit!
From the back seat, Audrey watches the fire recede into the
distance.
AUDREY
I can't believe it.
Is it really
over...?
Up front Jeep stares out at the dark road ahead.
JEEP
No...It's just starting...
Charlie cradles the baby, apprehensive. The baby looks up at
her, smiles. She can't help but smile back at him. Jeep
eyes her.
97.
JEEP
Better not hold him too long.
Might get attached.
Charlie looks over, feels his lingering anger.
CHARLIE
Look, I'm sorry for what I said to
you earlier, `bout you following me
around. I didn't mean it.
JEEP
Nothin' to be sorry about. It's
true. I did follow you around. At
least now I know there was a good
reason.
Charlie's reacts, a bit stung.
Jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned
at least a little. Charlie is about to respond when Audrey
leans in from the back seat.
AUDREY
We're here.
She points ahead to a beaten up road sign that says:
"Now Entering Red Rock National Park, Next Rest Stop 30
MILES"
JEEP
Okay, all we gotta do is --
CRASH!
The roof buckles above them.
The windows BLOW OUT.
Jeep, Charlie and Audrey slip frantically down in their seats
as the roof presses down at them. The windows BURST.
Jeep grabs the Glock and fires wildly up at the roof.
98.
With tremendous strength, Gabriel pulls his upper body
through the broken back window toward Audrey.
AUDREY
Jeep!
Jeep swings the gun around.
JEEP
Duck!
BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow
him down.
JEEP
Audrey, the flare gun!
Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding
Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the
risk of hitting Audrey.
Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now.
Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her
hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes
off INSIDE THE CAR!
Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS
through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July!
Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the
windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, SETTING
HIS HAIR ABLAZE.
And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and FIRE.
BOOM! Gabriel is blown back partially through the rear
window. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to
pull himself back in. Nothing slows this guy down.
Jeep pulls the trigger again and...CLICK.
No bullets!
Audrey frantically reloads the flare gun. Brings it up to
fire, but he's too fast! WHACK! Gabriel knocks her into the
side of the car with a sweep of his hand. She's out cold.
99.
Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again.
Jeep knows there's only one thing to do.
JEEP
Get down on the floor!
Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in
front of the passenger seat.
Jeep PUNCHES IT.
The speedometer leaps ahead.
70...80...90...
Gabriel's now completely in the car.
They're helpless.
Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie,
his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when...
AUDREY (O.S.)
Get off her, you fucking asshole!
Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just
in time. He flails wildly about but this young girl rides
him like one helluva a cowboy.
100...110...120...
AUDREY
Do it, Jeep! Do it now!
JEEP SLAMS ON THE BREAKS, SENDING GABRIEL AND AUDREY SHOOTING
FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD LIKE A BULLET.
The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road
with a sickening crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE.
Jeep's side of the car is crushed.
Blood is running down his
forehead.
Charlie crawls up from the floor.
CHARLIE
C'mon, Jeep!
100.
He tries to focus on her.
CHARLIE
Jeep!
She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.
JEEP
The baby?
CHARLIE
Alive.
JEEP
And what about...
CHARLIE
Nothing could have survived that.
JEEP
(ANGUISHED)
Audrey...
CHARLIE
She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved
us. Now c'mon, we gotta go!
Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from
the demolished Cruiser.
Jeep is at the wheel. He looks aged, scarred from the
experience. His exposed arms are completely covered with the
INTRICATE WRITING...The Instructions. The boy he once was is
gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him.
CHARLIE'S VOICE
... And how just at the moment when
everything seemed lost...
Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms.
It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy
family. Of course you'll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF
WEAPONRY in the back seat.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
...a mighty warrior fell in order
to save me.
Jeep glances over at Charlie and the baby.
He smiles at the
image of maternal bliss.
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
And a boy faced his fear and rose
up to save us all.
The sun shines through the car windows, filling our eyes with
its fiery light.
THE END
