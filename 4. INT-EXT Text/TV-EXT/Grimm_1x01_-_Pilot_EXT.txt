      HELICOPTER SHOT: PULL BACK from the license plate to reveal
      a bright YELLOW VAN on a TWO LANE HIGHWAY.  As we PULL HIGHER
      we see FOREST on both sides of the road.  The van slows and
      turns onto a dirt forest service road.

      But we CONTINUE on PULLING HIGHER to reveal the vast forest
      surrounding a medium sized city nestled in the Pacific
      Northwest.  Portland.

      SHOT CONTINUES into Portland proper.  It's early morning and
      traffic is already filling the streets.

      SHOT CONTINUES over the city to a UNIVERSITY CAMPUS right
      towards a UNIVERSITY DORM and right into --*

      SYLVIE, 18, a U. of Portland freshman, all the way to her*
      iPod ear buds playing The MOODY BLUES SONG. *

      Sylvie is exiting her dorm and pulling on her red sweat shirt. *
      Starts jogging.  A FEW STUDENTS are moving about.*

      Sylvie runs across campus and into the surrounding forest. *


      The path through the forest is well worn.  Sylvie is in good
      shape, breathing steady.  THROUGH THE TREES all we can see
      is her RED HOODED SWEATSHIRT against the forest green.

      Sylvie approaches a fork in the trail, chooses the path less
      traveled.  The rain forest is dense, but shafts of morning*
      light endow the woods with a warm glow.  She powers up the*
      trail, heading toward a large boulder next to a ravine. *
      Birds and butterflies rise in the morning air.  A serene,
      magical morning.  As she passes the boulder, we SEE A SUDDEN
      FLASH of MOVEMENT.                                                                                        2.

      Something moves with blinding speed, hitting Sylvie, knocking*
      her completely off the trail and into the ravine below.  Her
      iPod goes flying.

      We HEAR SCREAMS -- drowned out by vicious SNARLING.  Suddenly*
      all is silent except for the MUTED MUSIC of the Moody Blues*
      coming from her PINK iPod in the brush.

                                    IPOD MOODY BLUES
                    ... once upon a time in your wildest
                    dreams...


      A new French bakery in the old part of downtown Portland. 
      C'EST LA VIE on the window.  Fresh baked goods and coffee. 


      Nick exits the bakery.  HANK GREEN, late forties, suit and*
      tie, stands by a car, digital camera in hand.  He shoots*
      pictures of Nick exiting the bakery.*

                                      NICK*
                    What are you doing?*

                                      HANK*
                    Trying to make this thing work. *

      Hank turns the camera on TWO GOOD-LOOKING 20ish WOMEN walking*
      towards them.  Both are well dressed.  The blonde carries a*
      briefcase; the brunette is talking on her blackberry.

      Hank snaps a couple of photos, checks the screen.*

                                    HANK (CONT'D)*
                    Nothing.  We're gonna have to take*
                    it in.*

      As they pass, the blonde glances at Nick.  She smiles.  He*
      smiles back.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)*
                    Hey, hey, what're you lookin' at,*
                    you got a girlfriend --*

                                      NICK*
                    That's not what I'm lookin' at.*

                                      HANK*
                    Don't ruin her for me.*

                                      NICK*
                    She wears Armani, makes low six*
                    figures, drives a BMW and she's
                    falling for a senior partner at her
                    law firm.  Nothing but trouble, Hank.

                                      HANK*
                    Why can't you just look at her ass*
                    like the rest of us.

      Hank gets in the car.  We HEAR radio CHATTER. *

      The beautiful blonde glances back at Nick, sensing something. *
      She suddenly MORPHS into a HIDEOUS LOOKING OLD WITCH.  Nick
      is stunned.  He blinks and just that quickly the woman is
      once again herself.

      Nick shakes off the image, not sure what just happened, then --*

                                    HANK (CONT'D)*
                    Nick, get in the car, we got a call. *                                                                                        4.


      At the intersection, LIGHT CHANGES to RED, Nick runs through*
      it.  We PAN UP TO the BRIDGE ABOVE discovering an SUV PULLING*
      AN AIRSTREAM TRAILER into downtown Portland.*


      About eight cars behind Marie's SUV we find a mid-nineties
      GREEN corvette.


      Marie takes a left turn, the corvette continues past.


      Marie's SUV continues down the street, turning right at
      another intersection.

      A moment later the green corvette appears from an alley,
      following her.


      HIGH ANGLE SHOT, looking down through the thick magical
      forest.  And we discover Nick and Hank, badges on their coats,
      being lead down the trail by a FOREST SERVICE OFFICER.  OTHER
      COPS are in evidence.                                                                                        5.

                                      FOREST OFFICER
                    The hiker flagged me down, he came
                    through the ravine and he found this.

      Off the trail now, the forest service officer shows them a
      severed forearm.  A small piece of a RED RIPPED SWEATSHIRT
      is still on the arm.  Nick kneels down, carefully studies
      the cloth and arm and the ground around it.

                                    NICK
                    This ground's undisturbed.  This all
                    there is?

                                      FOREST OFFICER
                    The rest of her is in the ravine.

      They move down into--

      THE RAVINE -- rugged and overgrown.  They move down, stopping*
      when they see something pretty gruesome that we don't see.

      There's a lot of blood splatter on the bushes.  Leaves torn
      from branches, branches broken.  It was a violent attack.

                                    NICK
                    How do you know it's a her?

      Forest Service Officer moves some brush aside, revealing a
      pink tennis shoe.

                                    HANK
                    Woman's Nike.

                                    NICK
                    What kind of animal could do this?

                                      FOREST OFFICER
                    Normally we'd be able to tell by the
                    tracks: bear, cougar, wolf...

                                    HANK
                    Well which is it?

                                      FOREST OFFICER
                    That's where it gets interesting.


      Nick, iPod in a baggie, and Hank return to their car. 
      AMBULANCE is on scene, patrol cars, C.S.I. team, etc.

                                    HANK
                    Gotta be an animal.

                                    NICK
                    I'm hoping it's an animal.

                                    HANK
                    Unless he butchered her on the spot,
                    took the pieces with him.                                                                                        7.

                                    NICK
                    I don't think so, he would have had
                    to bag her up, we would have seen
                    drag marks, maybe some tape or
                    plastic.

                                    HANK
                    We don't have much to go on.  Except
                    a lousy boot print.

                                    NICK
                    And the iPod.

                                    HANK
                    If it's hers.

                                    NICK
                    The song was on "repeat".  Somebody
                    must've really liked it.

                                    HANK
                    What was the song?

                                    NICK
                    "Your Wildest Dreams".

                                    HANK
                    Moody Blues, one of their better.
                          (starts singing)
                    "Once upon a time in your wildest
                    dreams."

      Nick shoots him a look.

                                    NICK
                    I didn't know you couldn't sing.


      An older suburb.  The SUV pulls down the street and stops.


      A bit of a fixer-upper at the end of the street.  Marie pulls
      the SUV and Airstream quickly up the long drive into the
      back yard, out of sight from the street.


      Marie gets out, moving as fast as she can with a cane to the
      back door, keeping an eye on the street.

      She peers through the window, the house is dark.

      She runs the cane along the top of the door jam.  No key. 
      She looks around, lifts a potted plant.  Revealing a key. 
      For the first time, Marie smiles.


      CLOSE ON MAGNET PHOTO of Sylvie the jogger and her roommate*
      in the red hoodies.

                                      NICK'S VOICE*
                    It's her.*                                                                                      10.

      Nick and Hank are walking to their car.  Nick is looking at*
      the photo magnet in hand.

                                      HANK*
                    Yeah.*

                                      NICK*
                    I hate this job sometimes.*

                                      HANK*
                    Yeah.*

      As they get into the car --*


      A classic old VW panel van with the C'EST LA VIE bakery logo
      on the side parks in front.  Juliette gets out, wearing a*
      RED PEA COAT, walks up the path towards the front door.

      In the house behind her, the curtain moves, Marie watching
      in the dark.  Juliette doesn't see her.


      Nick drives up in his Mustang.  Parks next to Juliette's VW*
      van.  Nick gets out, shuts the door, pauses, trying to let
      go of the day.  Suddenly he tenses, and turns, looking into
      the night.  CAMERA PUSHES IN on the back of his neck.  EXTREME
      C.U. the hairs on the back of his neck literally stand up.

      NICK - brushes off the feeling and heads for the house.*


      Marie, cane in hand, walks down the street with Nick.  A
      couple of old streetlights add pools of light to the otherwise
      dark street.  A cool night breeze ruffles the trees.

                                    NICK
                    Aren't you cold?  Don't you want to
                    get a coat?

                                      MARIE
                    I'm just happy to feel anything right
                    now.

                                    NICK
                    How bad is it?

                                      MARIE
                    It's not good, Nick.                                                                                      13.

                                    NICK
                    What did they tell you?

                                      MARIE
                    Two months, two weeks, two days,
                    nobody knows.  But there's so many
                    things I have to tell you.

                                    NICK
                    Why didn't you come sooner?

                                      MARIE
                      I couldn't.

                                    NICK
                    Why?

                                      MARIE
                    Don't ask so many questions, just*
                    listen to me.  There are things you
                    don't know, things about your family.

                                    NICK
                    My family?  You're my family.

      She stops, takes hold of his arm and looks into his eyes.

                                      MARIE
                    Have you been seeing strange things,
                    Nick?  Things you can't explain.
                          (off his look)
                    I knew it.  I'm so sorry.  It's
                    happening faster than I expected. 
                    The curse of our family is already
                    passing to you.

                                    NICK
                    What are you talking about?

                                      MARIE
                    After tonight your life will never
                    be the same.  I'm so sorry.  I know
                    you love Juliette and she's perfect
                    for you, but you have to send her
                    away and never see her again.

                                    NICK
                    What?

                                      MARIE
                    I know this is impossible to
                      understand, it was hard for me, too
                    when I was your age.
                          (sees something)
                    Oh my god.  He's here.

      Across the street she sees the candy apple GREEN CORVETTE.*                                                                                      14.*

                                      MARIE (CONT'D)*
                    Mr. Hulda.*

                                    NICK
                    Mr. Hulda?  Who the hell is Mr. --*

      We hear a beastly ROAR; as they turn they are violently
      attacked by a grotesque troll-like creature, oddly dressed
      like a businessman in suit and tie.

      He swings a hatchet-like weapon with a claw at the end. *
      With surprising agility, Marie ducks the weapon, kicking*
      out, catching Hulda painfully in the knee.  Marie follows*
      with a quick punch to his kidney.  Nick tries to move in but*
      is backhanded by Hulda. *

      Nick goes down, looks up as Marie continues her attack. *
      Nick is stunned by Marie's fighting skills.*

      Hulda jabs the claw, this time catching Marie's shoulder,*
      slashing her clothes and drawing blood.*

      Nick tackles the Beast, they go to the ground.  The Beast is*
      up faster than Nick, hitting him as he scrambles to his feet.*

      Nick goes down hard.  Beast turns his attention back to Marie
      as she pulls A BLADE FROM HER CANE and stabs him.  He screams*
      in agony and backhands her.*

      Nick, dazed, watches as the Beast raises the claw hammer
      high to slam down on Marie.  Nick grabs for his gun, aiming
      as the beast brings the claw hammer down.  Nick fires.

      The bullet tears into the beast's neck.  Causing him to twist
      in pain.  He turns, glares at Nick.  And comes for him. 
      Nick continues to fire, emptying his gun.  Bullets tear into
      the beast who continues toward Nick.

      Finally collapsing at Nick's feet.

      Nick scrambles to his feet, moves to the creature, staring
      down in horror at the hideous troll.  He watches in utter
      shock as the troll's features MORPH into the middle aged man
      with the comb-over who was driving the GREEN CORVETTE.

      Nothing menacing about him at all.  He struggles for breath,
      then dies.

      Marie groans.  Nick turns.  She is on the ground, badly
      injured.  Nick runs to her as --


      Having heard the gunshots, Juliette runs out of the house.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Nick!                                                                                      15.

      She sees Nick kneeling beside Marie down the street in a
      pool of light.


      Juliette runs to them, stunned to see the body of a man on
      the ground.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Oh my god!

                                    NICK
                          (hands his cell to
                            Juliette)
                    Call 911!

      Juliette calls as Nick cradles Marie.  She looks up weakly.

                                      MARIE
                    Did you get... Mr. Hulda...?*

                                    NICK
                      I don't... I shot something, but...

                                      MARIE
                    That was him.  I'm so sorry, Nick,
                    he was following me, I thought I
                    lost him.  I'm so sorry for what's
                    going to happen to you...

      She stares up at Nick, losing consciousness.


      High shot looking down on Marie in Nick's arms and Juliette
      on the phone, all in the pool of street lamp light.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

33SAME ANGLE, LATER33*

      POLICE on scene.  Ambulance.  Cops tape off the crime scene. 
      Hank with them.  Police PHOTOGRAPHER shoots photos of Mr.
      Hulda dead on the ground.  NEIGHBORS gawk from the perimeter.*

      Juliette, very upset, is being interviewed by an OFFICER.

                                      JULIETTE
                    I didn't see what happened.  I heard
                    gunshots and I ran out of the house.

      She looks at the PARAMEDICS who are lifting Marie onto a
      gurney.  Nick and Hank move with them as they load her into
      the back of the ambulance.                                                                                      16.

                                    NICK
                    He came out of nowhere and he had
                    that thing in his hand... he went
                    right for her, Hank, I had no choice.

                                    HANK
                    Take it easy.  You go to the hospital,
                    I'll handle this.

                                    NICK
                    She said she knew him.  That his
                    name was Hulda.*

      Hank glances at Hulda on the ground.  With his business suit*
      and comb-over, Hulda looks like a mild mannered accountant.*

                                    HANK
                    I'll run his prints.

      Juliette moves up.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Do you want me to come with you?

                                    NICK
                    Stay here, I'll be home as soon as I
                    can.

                                      JULIETTE
                    I love you.

      Nick hugs Juliette and gets into the back of the ambulance,
      the doors close and the ambulance takes off, siren blasting.


      A UNIFORM stands on the front porch as Nick drives up.  Nick
      heads for the front door.

                                    NICK
                          (to cop)
                    Thanks for staying with her.

      Cop nods, moves off as Nick lets himself in.


      They head back to the house.

                                    NICK
                    I still can't believe any of this is
                      happening...

                                      JULIETTE
                    How long did you live with your aunt?

                                    NICK
                    She was my mother from the time I
                    was twelve.

                                      JULIETTE
                    After your parents died...

                                    NICK
                    Yeah...

      She takes his hand as they walk up the steps to the house
      and are about to enter when -- a STRANGE ANIMALISTIC SOUND
      comes from behind.  Nick spins, not knowing what to expect. 
      Something moves in the trees and is gone.                                                                                      24.

      Juliette looks at him, concerned.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Nick?  It was just a cat.

      As they go inside, the trees wave in the wind.  In the shadowy*
      moonlit darkness one of the trees looks almost like a*
      creature. *


      A PAIR OF THE BOOTS "we're looking for" walk down the street
      The boots are SPATTERED with something that looks like paint
      but could be dried blood.  They move past a white picket
      fence, stop at a mail box.  A HAND reaches into the mailbag
      and deposits a few letters inside the box.

      This fine fellow will be known as the POSTMAN.  We don't see
      his face.  But we see his standard issue U.S. postal uniform,
      and his heavy bag.

      And OVER HIS SHOULDER we SEE the cute little girl in the red
      hoody (ROBIN HOWELL, 9) walking past, school backpack on her*
      shoulders.

      She moves past.  For a moment the Postman is motionless. 
      Then his HAND suddenly SNAPS the mailbox door closed.                                                                                      25.

      The BOOTS CHANGE direction, following the little girl.  We
      HEAR him humming a familiar tune.  "Once Upon A Time In Your
      Wildest Dreams".


      Nick walks with Hank towards their car.

                                    HANK
                    Is she any better?

                                    NICK
                    Not really.                                                                                      27.*

                                    HANK
                    People pull out of comas.

      Suddenly their cell phones start ringing.  They both answer.*

                    NICKHANK
          Hello.Yeah...

      They turn and look at each other.

                                    NICK
                      Kidnapping.

                                    HANK
                    Four seven three Ravenswood, got it.*

      They both hang up and start running for the car.


      Cops cars in front, police lights on, cops everywhere,
      whatever this is, it's big.  Neighbors are being kept back.

      Nick and Hank make their way to the porch where a MOTHER is
      crying hard, GRANDFATHER is with her.  He's in his sixties,*
      flowing white hair, beard.  A little unkempt.*

                                      MOTHER
                    ...she was supposed to go straight
                    there from school...*

                                      GRANDFATHER
                    She never showed up.  I looked all
                    over the neighborhood, then I came
                    right here.  YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT
                    THERE, YOU'VE GOT TO FIND HER!

      Sgt. Blaknikoff approaches Hank and Nick, photo in hand.

                                    HANK
                    What do we know.

                                      SERGEANT BLAKNIKOFF
                    Little girl on her way to her*
                      grandfather's house never showed up.*
                          (re: white haired man)*
                    That's him, guy with the beard.*

                                      NICK*
                    Do we think he's clean?*

                                      SERGEANT BLAKNIKOFF*
                    We're looking into that. *
                          (holds up photo)*
                    This is the best photo they had.*                                                                                      28.

      CLOSE ON PHOTO - ROBIN HOWELL, the little girl we saw the*
      Postman go after, wearing her red school sweatshirt.  Smiling. 
      Long hair in pigtails.

      PULL BACK FROM PHOTO WHICH IS NOW PROJECTED ON A WALL IN:


      A mail truck blows past kicking up the fall leaves on the
      beautiful sunny day.


      CLOSE ON MAP.  Hank and Nick move down the sidewalk, following
      Robin Howell's route.  As they cross the street:*

                                    NICK
                    She's supposed to cross Hunter lane
                    here, then go around the park to
                      Hildabrand.

      They stop.  Looking at the park.

                                    HANK
                    The old man's house is on the other*
                    side of the park, right?

                                    NICK
                          (re: map)
                    Right.  4753 Hildebrand Road. 
                    Directly across from here.

                                    HANK
                    When I was a kid I wouldn't have
                    gone all the way around the park.

                                    NICK
                    Her mom was very specific about the
                    route.

                                    HANK
                    Yeah, right, kids always do what
                    their moms tell 'em.  I know I did.

      They both head for the park.


      The old park is a little wild.  Large old trees cast long
      shadows over the grounds.  Patches of wild flowers and thick
      ferns.  A place you could get lost in.  Several paths criss-
      cross through.

      An old wishing well can be seen among the ferns.  A wooden
      bridge arches over a small creek.

      Nick and Hank move through the park.  It's a little spooky. 
      One of the trails leads through a darker part.

                                    NICK
                    I'll take this trail.

      Hank nods, Nick moves down the trial as Hank moves off the
      beaten path into a more forested part.                                                                                      30.

      HANK - Studies the ground, stops when he sees a broken branch,
      moves off in that direction.

      NICK - moves slowly down the path checking both sides.

      HANK - continues through the forest, sees a bright color
      amidst all the green.  He moves toward it.

      NICK - comes out the far side of the park.  He refers to the
      map, looks across the street at 4753 HILDABRAND ROAD carved
      on a wooden sign over the entrance to Grandpa's house.  A
      classic Craftsman's cottage in need of a few repairs, perched
      on a little rise.

                                    HANK (O.S.)
                    NICK!  GOT SOMETHING!

      Nick turns and runs back towards the sound of Hank's voice.

      Nick runs through the woods to discover HANK kneeling down
      next to something on the ground -- A YOUNG GIRL'S BRIGHTLY
      COLORED SCHOOL BACK PACK, partially covered by brush.  Hank
      points out the RH drawn on the backpack with a sharpie.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Robin Howell.*

                                    NICK
                    She must have been grabbed somewhere
                    in this area.

                                    HANK
                    Be careful where you step.

      Hank gets on his cell as Nick searches the area.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                          (into cell)
                    We got a crime scene in Korbes Park.*

      NICK - pushes through some bushes with broken branches.  In
      open ground beyond he sees some drag marks -- AND A COUPLE
      OF FAMILIAR BOOT PRINTS.

                                    NICK
                          (calling back to Hank)
                    Hank, I got boot prints over here,
                    it's the same guy, he took her this
                    way!

      Nick moves quickly through the bushes which open out to a
      grassy area.

      Cute houses line the shady street on the other side.

      Nick looks up and down the street, trail suddenly cold. 
      Nothing.  No one in sight.                                                                                      31.

      Then he hears a screen door SLAM, turns to look.

      A MAN in his 30's, cardigan sweater, walks towards his
      mailbox.  His classic VW bug parked out front.

      Hank moves up behind Nick.

                                    HANK
                    They're on their way.

      Hank sees some PEOPLE crossing the grassy area into the park. 
      He moves to them, flashing his badge.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Sorry folks, we have crime scene,
                    you're not going to be able to go in
                    the park right now.

      As Hank is badging them, Nick is watching THREE YOUNG GIRLS
      ON BICYCLES riding past.  He watches them as they cross in
      front of the GUY picking up his mail.

      GUY - glances at young girls.

      NICK - sees the guy suddenly MORPH for into wolf-like
      features.  Then back to normal again.

      Nick and Guy lock eyes for a moment.  Chilling.  Guy turns
      away, walking briskly back to his house.

                                    NICK
                    I got him... I GOT HIM!  HANK!

      Hank turns and sees --

      Nick suddenly sprinting across the street.

      Hank tears after him.

      GUY - looks back, sees Nick and Hank running toward him. 
      Guy turns and quickly enters his house.  Shutting the door
      just as Nick slams into it, knocking him back.


      Crawling with COPS.  Police cars, etc.


      Nick yanks his arm away from Hank's grip.

                                    NICK
                    If she's not in there, he's got her
                    someplace else.

                                    HANK
                    Take it easy, Nick.  What d'ya see
                    in this guy that we don't?

      Nick looks over at --

      Eddy Monroe sitting in the back of a patrol car.  Staring
      back at him.                                                                                      34.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    He's got no priors, he's completely
                    clean.

                                    NICK
                    The way he looked at those girls on
                    the bikes.

                                    HANK
                    Jesus, Nick.  That all you got?

                                    NICK
                          (defending himself)
                    No, no, he does fit the profile,
                    he's a loner, never been married,
                    lives across the street from a park...

                                    HANK
                    You can't profile a guy on gut
                    instinct alone.
                          (puts finger in Nick's
                            chest)
                    That doesn't get him into a court --
                    unless he sues our ass.

      Unsure, Nick looks back at Monroe.


      The mail truck pulls in, parks next to a long row of other
      mail trucks.  It's late, the yard is deserted.                                                                                      35.*


      Full moon on the rise.


      Eddy Monroe can be seen inside eating from a can of barbecued
      baked beans.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL - NICK in dark sweatshirt, jeans, is
      outside, watching Monroe.  Nick's car is parked in b.g.

      Nick's PHONE vibrates, he pulls it out, sees the name JULIETTE
      and her PHOTO smiling up at him.

      He hesitates.

      Then he HEARS the back door OPEN and CLOSE.  He hits IGNORE
      CALL, moves quickly around the side of the house.  Looking
      into the backyard.  Stops.  Pulls back.  As he sees --


      Monroe walks to his back fence line and, incredibly, starts
      to take a leak on it.

      Nick flattens himself against the side of the house watching --

      Monroe pisses along the back fence line.  Monroe zips up,
      returns to the back door, hesitates, sniffs the night air,
      then enters.  Lights go off inside the house.

      Nick waits a moment, creeps along the wall passing a window
      WHICH SUDDENLY EXPLODES as Monroe leaps through it and attacks
      Nick.  Scaring the shit out of him.  Nick looks up at Monroe
      who is in FULL WOLF FACE now.  Nick tries to get up,
      Monroe/Wolf picks him up and flings him against the house.                                                                                      39.

                                      MONROE
                          (closing in)
                    Shouldn't a come back.

      Nick desperately reaches for his gun.  Monroe MORPHS BACK to
      his human self.  And smiles.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    Oh come on, get real, I was just
                    makin' a point.  Let's grab a brew
                          (starts back towards
                            house)
                    And by the way, you're payin' for
                    that window.

      Off Nick,

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                      40.

                                            ACT FOUR


      CLOSE - ON A FAMILIAR LICENSE PLATE -- it reads SMILE1 and
      it's moving.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL the bright YELLOW VAN which we saw in
      the very beginning.  The VAN moves past some run down houses,
      a trailer park named MILLPOND GLEN; the van turns on a narrow
      dirt road, crosses a rickety old bridge, leaving civilization
      behind and heads into the woods.


      Ramshackle old timber frame.  The van pulls to a stop and
      the POSTMAN gets out.  Humming the now familiar tune, "Once
      Upon a Time in Your Wildest Dreams".

      We get our first look at him.  A thoroughly average looking
      guy in his forties.  He unlocks the back of the van, picks
      up the large mail sack, hefts it over his shoulder and heads
      for the house.  We HEAR some WHIMPERING from inside the bag.


      HEADLIGHTS move down the highway, swerving a little.  Forest
      on either side.


      The volkswagen pulls past the MILLPOND GLEN trailer court,
      filled with older trailers, overgrown trees; Monroe still
      has his head out the window, nose to the night air.

      He stops the car at the beginning of the rickety bridge. 
      The same bridge we saw the Postman drive over.                                                                                      47.

                                      MONROE
                    This is as far as we drive.

      They get out.

                                    NICK
                    Why?

                                      MONROE
                    He'll hear us, why do you think.

      Monroe stares at the bridge.

                                    NICK
                    He's on the other side?

                                      MONROE
                          (nods)
                    Oh he's real close.

      Monroe opens the trunk of the car.  Pulls out a baggie.

                                    NICK
                    What are you gonna do, roll a joint?!

                                      MONROE
                      Wolfsbane.  So he won't scent us.

      Monroe rubs some wolfsbane on himself, tosses the baggie to
      Nick.

                                    NICK
                    You're kidding, right?

                                      MONROE
                    Not if you want to stay alive.

      Nick sighs, rubs some wolfsbane on himself.  Nick heads for
      the bridge.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    What are you doin'?

                                    NICK
                    You said he was over the bridge.

                                      MONROE
                    Why don't you just call him and tell
                    him you're comin'?  This way.


      Monroe heads down the embankment.  Moonlight reflects off
      the water, eerie bridge in the b.g. Trees overhang the banks. 
      Nick follows and they wade across a small stream.                                                                                      48.

                                    NICK
                          (whispers)
                    Isn't this what the bridge is for?

      They climb up the embankment on the other side.  Monroe stops
      suddenly, seeing the POSTMAN'S COTTAGE a hundred yards away;
      Monroe holds out his hand to signal Nick: stop.

                                      MONROE
                    That's his place.

      Monroe SUDDENLY MORPHS into a Blutbad.  Startling Nick.  Is
      he going to attack?  Nick instinctively reaches for his gun.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                          (still in Blutbad
                            form)
                    Relax.

      With a great EFFORT Monroe forces himself back into human
      form.  Breathing hard:

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    Let's go.

      They continue through the woods, getting closer to the house. 
      Monroe SUDDENLY MORPHS AGAIN.  Stops.  His breathing even*
      quicker now.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.

      Morphs back.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    He's in there, I know he's in there.

                                    NICK
                    Do I need something like, silver
                    bullets?

                                      MONROE
                    What are you, an idiot?

      They take a few more steps, Monroe morphs again.  Releasing
      a low GUTTURAL GROWL from his throat.

                                    NICK
                    What's happening?

                                      MONROE
                          (back to human, really
                            agitated)
                    This is as far as I can... I can't
                    guarantee what'll happen if I go any
                    closer.  It's too dangerous, I don't
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      49.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    know if I'll be on his side, your
                    side, I might even go after the girl.

      Monroe retreats to the stream.  Nick hurries to catch up.

                                    NICK
                    I'm supposed to do this by myself?

                                      MONROE
                      I wouldn't if I were you.  Keep this.

      Monroe stuffs the baggie of wolfsbane into Nick's hands.

                                      MONROE (CONT'D)
                    There's nothing more I can do.

      Monroe lopes off down the embankment and across the stream. 
      Nick turns back and looks at the cottage.  Then down at the
      baggie of wolfsbane in his hand.


      Nick waits anxiously, watching as Hank's car drives up. 
      Hank gets out, Nick runs up.

                                    HANK
                    Where is he?

                                    NICK
                          (rapid fire)
                    In a house on the other side of the
                    bridge but we can't take the bridge
                    so we have to go cross the stream
                    but you're gonna have to put some of
                    this on first --

      Nick rubs wolfsbane on Hank who slaps his hand away.

                                    HANK
                    What the hell are you --

                                    NICK
                    So he won't smell us.

      Hank just stares at him.                                                                                      51.*

                                      HANK*
                    We're not huntin' deer here -- *
                    where's back up?*

                                    NICK
                    You're the only one I called.

                                    HANK
                    WHAT?

                                    NICK
                    I already cried wolf once.  You think
                    anybody'd believe me?  Come on.

      Nick leads a reluctant Hank down the embankment.

                                      HANK*
                    How'd you find this place?*

                                      NICK*
                          (lying)*
                    Uh... the boots.  I couldn't sleep,*
                    I started looking at addresses and
                    this is one of 'em. 

      Nick wades across the stream, Hank following.*

                                    HANK
                          (whispers)
                    You do know there's a bridge, right?

      And up the other side.  COTTAGE visible a hundred yards away.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    You better be right this time, buddy. *
                    You saw boot prints, right.*

                                      NICK*
                    Yeah. Over there by the house.*

                                      HANK*
                    Exact match?*

                                      NICK*
                    From what I could tell. *

                                      HANK*
                    You run his plates?*

                                      NICK*
                    I'm still waiting.  What's the matter,*
                    you don't trust me?*

      Hank sizes up his partner for a moment, then:*

                                    HANK
                    Okay.  Let's do this.                                                                                      52.


      Nick and Hank wait.  Hank grabs a rag off the porch railing 
      and is drying off his shoes when he realizes Nick has his
      hand on his gun.

                                    HANK
                    Nick, enough.  Get your badge out,
                    calm the hell down.  What's his name?

                                    NICK
                    Who?

                                    HANK
                    The guy we're here for!

                                    NICK
                    Oh.  Um... I forget.

      Hank shoots him a look as Postman opens the door with a
      pleasant smile on his face.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Good evening.  Can I help you?

      Nick and Hank both glance down at the Postman's feet.  He's
      wearing his house slippers.

                                    HANK
                    Sorry to disturb you, sir, I'm
                    Detective Green, this is Detective
                      Burckhardt.  You have a few minutes?

      Nick stares hard at the Postman, expecting him to MORPH at
      any second.  Postman senses something about Nick.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Of course.  Would you like to come
                    in?                                                                                      53.

                                    HANK
                    That'd be great.

      They enter.


      Nick, dejected, and Hank walk away from the cottage.  Smoke
      rising from the chimney.

                                    NICK
                    Sorry, Hank, I really thought --

                                    HANK
                          (stops)
                    Wait, wait.  The song --

                                    NICK
                    What song?

                                    HANK
                    He was whistling the song.  The one
                    on the dead girl's iPod.                                                                                      57.

      Hank and Nick swing around.

      POSTMAN - can be seen in the window, watching them from forty
      feet away.  Suddenly the Postman moves from the window.  A
      moment later all the lights in the house go out.

      Hank and Nick break into a run, racing back to the house.


      Nick and Hank run out, guns ready, Hank reloading.

      They move up cautiously on the Postman who's dying.

                                    NICK
                    Where is she?  WHERE IS SHE?!

      The Postman looks up at Nick.  Trying to speak.  Nick leans
      in close as the Postman whispers:

                                      POSTMAN
                    Grimm...

      The Postman dies, his dead eyes glaring up at Nick.

                                    HANK
                    She's gotta be in the house.

      They race back to the house.


      MUSIC MONTAGE: Police cars parked in front.  Police, Mother,
      Grandfather and Captain Ericson wait as Hank's car pulls up.

      They descend on the car as Nick gets out with Robin who runs*
      to her mother's tearful embrace.

      Nick and Hank watch the reunion as Capt. Ericson moves up,
      shakes their hands, clearly a job well done.


      Juliette opens the front door as Nick walks up the front
      steps.  She hugs him tight.

                                      JULIETTE
                    You saved her.

      Nick's arms go around her.  Hold on them.


      CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER - "Little Girl Found - Kidnapper Killed
      by Police".  File PHOTOS of Hank and Nick.

      Monroe is having his morning coffee, looking at the paper. 
      His house is now cleaned up.  KNOCK at the door.                                                                                      60.

      He gets up, opens the front door, revealing Nick.

                                      MONROE
                    Didn't expect to see you again - at
                    least not in one piece.

                                    NICK
                    I just wanted to say thanks.

                                      MONROE
                    He knew I helped you, didn't he.

                                    NICK
                    I don't know.

                                      MONROE
                    At least he's dead.  Otherwise he'd
                    be looking for me.  He was my cousin. 
                    Father's side.  We never got along
                          (stares at Nick, hard)
                    He had a lot of family... who loved
                    him.  Too bad you got your picture
                    in the paper.  Gonna make it easier
                    to find you.

      Beat.

                                    NICK
                    My aunt told me my parents were
                    murdered.

                                      MONROE
                    What's that got to do with me.

                                    NICK
                    I might need your help again sometime.

                                      MONROE
                    ...we'll see.

      He shuts the door on Nick who stares at the closed door then
      walks away.
