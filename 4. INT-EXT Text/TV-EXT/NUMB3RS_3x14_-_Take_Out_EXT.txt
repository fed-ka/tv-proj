  A MINIVAN calmly pulls into the valet lane, directly in front 
  of the restaurant --

  -- and THREE ROBBERS (TEAM #2: HECTOR CAMPOS, DRIVER, MASKED 
  MAN #3, MASKED MAN #4) in black masks, body armor and well 
  armed, jump out. 

  The hooded DRIVER steps out and holds the Valet at gun point.


  Valet lays on the ground, driver staring down at him,

  The other three team members disappear into the restaurant --


  The robbers (TEAM #2) rush out of the restaurant and hop into 
  the car. The speaker nods at the driver as he sits shotgun...

  ... and the DRIVER calmly lowers his handgun and shoots the 
  valet twice in the back of the head. 

  Picking up his two spent shell casings and calmly getting in 
  the Minivan.  They drive off.  BURN OUT --

                              COLBY
                Maybe they re sending us a message -- 
                in third world countries the drug 
                gangs and paramilitaries will kill 
                  civilians as a warning -- tells the

                You got the time right, the date, all 
                you missed was the location.

                              CHARLIE
                No, I missed something else...

                Hello, Professor... how goes your 
                Threat Matrixing?

                              CHARLIE
                It didn t work.

                              MILLIE
                I m sorry... I thought it was a good 
                  approach.

                              CHARLIE
                No, so did I...
                      (moving forward)
                So what do you know about MacMillan 
                  Pharmaceuticals?

                              MILLIE
                I know that pharmacokinetic modeling 
                might save the lives of 16,000 people 
                who over-dose on simple, over-the-

                              CHARLIE
                Did you know that some of these drug 
                  companies exploit third world 
                  countries, sell them overpriced or 
                expired medication --

                                MILLIE
                Yes, I did.

  Off Charlie s look,

                              MILLIE
                  Corporations aren t angels or demons. 
                They re profit-seeking concerns; some 
                better than others, some not --  

                              CHARLIE
                It seems to me that it should be as 
                  important to know where the money s 
                been as where it s going.

                                MILLIE
                I did my homework, Charlie. MacMillan 
                has had a checkered history, but 
                there s been a complete restaffing 
                over the past three years. New CEO, 
                new Board, new philosophy.
                      (beat)
                I would characterize them as a 
                  relatively responsible company now.

                              CHARLIE
                Relative to what?

                                MILLIE
                I should have known better than to 
                try and slip that word past a fellow 
                  mathematician.

  Which doesn t really answer the question.  But Millie is 
  already disappearing into a building, leaving a concerned 
  Charlie behind.


  As a MINIVAN pulls into the parking lot.  THREE ROBBERS (TEAM 
  #1:  HISPANIC MAN, MASKED MAN #1, MASKED MAN #2) jump out and 
  charge past the 

  VALET --

  Who is grabbed by the Hoodie-wearing driver (MARIA CAMPOS), 
  and thrown to the ground...

  The robbers disappear into the restaurant...

  ... and GUNFIRE ERUPTS from inside.  One of the robbers 
  (MASKED MAN #1) crashes backward, through the door...

  THE DRIVER --

  Startled, gun wavering from the valet s head...

  ... and we reveal that it s COLBY, who jams his gun under the 
  Driver s chin.

                I was wondering if Charlie spoke with 
                you about the MacMillan Project.

                              MILLIE
                  I thought I detected your voice 
                behind Dr. Eppes  new social

                the Vioxx debacle.  I don t want to

                              MILLIE
                So you think that my first act as 
                Division Chair would be to tear this 
                entire University apart in scandal.

                              AMITA
                Well, no... that s not what I meant--

                                MILLIE
                Then what did you mean?

  Amita takes a moment to consider her next words.

                Amita, what s the use of being morally 
                pure if you can t effect change?  A 
                large part of my job is to determine

  Millie smiles. Point to Amita...


    A middle-aged man, BERNARDO INFANTE, sits at the outskirts of 
    a schoolyard, watching over young children as they play.

  Colby, David, pull up across the street in the black SUV.  
  Slamming of the car door alerts Bernardo to their presence.

                              COLBY
                Don t.

  Bernardo quickly scans the schoolyard and playing children 
  behind him as he backs up.  David slowly takes out his badge.

  He backs up, closer to the children.

                              COLBY
                Senor Infante, please stop moving.

  He continues to back up, closer to the children.  Colby moves 
  around, trying to get between Bernardo and the kids.

                make another move toward the kids...

                There are days I think it would be

                      (beat)
                It would be small punishment for the 
                things I did before.  The greater 
                punishment is to live with them.

                  Upstream.  Swimming upstream.  

                              DON
                You lost me.  Again.

                              CHARLIE
                I think I need to find Amita.

  Charlie hurries off, leaving a pensive Don behind...


  Colby, David, four FBI SWAT move into position, crowbar held 
  between the door and the frame.  On a silent three count --


  INFANTE looking over his charges, much like the first time we 
  saw him...

  ACROSS THE STREET --

  HECTOR CAMPOS and DRIVER, (body armor, no masks) parked in a 
  van, watching...

                              DRIVER
                      (queasily)
                Todos?

                              CAMPOS
                      (coldly)
                Todos.

  The driver starts the minivan up, and does a U-turn... CAMPOS 
  lifting up a P90 and leaning it out the window...

  ... driver circling toward the playground as the minivan s 
  side panel opens up, TWO MORE GUNMEN WITH P90s taking aim...

  ... and the MINIVAN IS SMASHED BROADSIDE BY DON S SUV.  Both 
  cars spinning to a halt --

  -- as MORE FBI CARS SCREECH UP -- SIRENS WAILING -- 

  -- COLBY, DAVID, agents jumping out -- M4s out and aimed at 
  the van --



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    54.

    CONTINUED:4646


  CAMPOS --

  Staggers out of the van, P90 in hand... looking across the 
  street at 

  THE CHILDREN --

  running for the safety of the school, away from the 
  violence...  except for three very scared kids who find 
    INFANTE... and run toward him

  INFANTE --

  Sprints toward the three scared kids --

  DON --

  Gets out of his SUV --

  CAMPOS --

  Smiling, he s found his three targets, pulls the trigger in a 
  short burst... then again...

  BERNARDO INFANTE --

  Dives in front of the kids... BULLETS ripping into him --

  DON --

  Finger on the trigger, sees Colby and David have the angle on 
  Campos and... 

  COLBY, DAVID --

  Pull their triggers...

  CAMPOS --

  Flies violently backward, four bullets throwing him down to 
  the pavement, dead before his body rolls to a stop.

  DON --

  Holding his gun on the body of Hector Campos as Colby 
    approaches...

  FBI AGENTS --

  converge on the van, three men exit (TEAM #2, minus HECTOR 
  CAMPOS), hands held high in surrender.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS    314/51  "Take Out"  BUFF Rev   12/12/06    55.

    CONTINUED:4646


  DAVID --

  Turns his attention to the schoolyard, sees Infante s body 
  moving slightly, holsters his gun and quickly steps over...

  INFANTE --

  DEAD.  Bullet riddled body.  David falls to his knees, rolls 
  Infante over... and understands why the dead body moved...

  ... three very scared, but very much alive, children lying 
    underneath and behind the fallen Colonel. 

  ON DON --

  Surveying the scene; Colby over Campos  dead body, grimly 
    contemplating what he had to do...

  ... the dead Colonel... 

  ... David and the three children.

  Slowly, Don takes his finger from the trigger, holsters his 
  weapon.  Face etched with exhaustion, drained of spirit.
