      Storm clouds gather with unnatural speed above the hospital, 
      blotting out the stars in the night sky. In the parking lot, 
      a hasty evacuation takes place with NURSES and STAFF quickly 
      assisting patients into ambulances and vans.

      Lightning tears through the clouds, followed by a powerful 
      CRACK OF THUNDER. The sound startles the evacuees, turning 
      heads. More THUNDERCLAPS hit, each going off like CANNON 
      BLASTS as--


      Two cars soar into the darkness. Derek s FJ Cruiser closely 
      followed by Stiles s Jeep.


      SIREN LIGHTS FLASHING, an ambulance full of evacuees veers 
      away from the hospital s entrance. Derek s Cruiser and 
      Stiles s Jeep soar in past and SCREECH to a halt. 

      Derek gets out and yanks open the passenger door. He makes no 
      attempt to be gentle when pulling Jennifer out.

      Shutting the door of the Jeep, Scott pauses when he sees 
      Stiles pull a BASEBALL BAT out of the back.

                                  STILES
                    You got claws. I got a bat.

      He follows the others to the entrance.        TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/138.



      Rain hammers down over the entrance where Argent s SUV pulls 
      up. The doors click open as Argent, Allison and Isaac step 
      into the downpour. They quickly take cover under the awning 
      and peer in through the glass doors.

                                  ARGENT
                    Looks like the evacuation s over.

      Head tilted up, Isaac breathes in the air.

                                    ALLISON
                    Catching a scent?

                                  ISAAC
                    Not with the rain this heavy.

      He starts for the door, but Argent holds him back.

                                  ARGENT
                    I ll go first.

      Pulling a gun from his coat, he clicks open the door.


      Deucalion carefully releases a LEVER on the outside terminal 
      of one of the hospital s rooftop GENERATORS. He turns to 
      Melissa with a gracious smile.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Thank you. That was more than 
                    helpful.

                                    MELISSA
                    What now? What do you want with me?

                                  DEUCALION
                    You? You re going to be my gesture 
                    of good will.

                                    MELISSA
                    What?      TEEN WOLF EP#310"THE OVERLOOKED"GREEN4/4/1322.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Go find your son. But do yourself a 
                    favor, Melissa. Be careful out 
                    there.

      Confused, she watches him walk away, cane sweeping across the 
      roof as he disappears under the rain.


      Toe claws covered in BLOOD, a red-eyed Kali steps back from 
      Jennifer s horribly slashed body. Fingers twitching, blood 
      dripping from the lacerations over her skull, she finally 
      lies still.

      Breathing hard from exertion, Kali turns away and her eyes 
      change back to normal to reveal a look of regret.

                                  KALI (V.O.)
                    I didn t understand why I had to 
                    kill her too. She was harmless.


      Face and body decimated, an unrecognizable Jennifer crawls 
      across the arid ground, through dust and dirt, desperately 
      trying to reach something just a few yards ahead...

      THE STUMP OF A ONCE MASSIVE TREE. Its thick roots stretch 
      out, plunging into the dirt below.

                                  JENNIFER (V.O.)
                    For years the Nemeton s power was 
                    virtually gone. Like a dying ember 
                    from a burned out fire...


      Jennifer s bloodied hand reaches out, fingers touching one of 
      the large roots of the tree which plunges down through the 
      dirt and into--


      TWO DEPUTIES discover Jennifer lying over the stump of the 
      great tree. One of them, Stilinski, turns to the other.

                                  STILINSKI
                    She s still breathing.


      The doors SLAM OPEN and the silhouetted figure of Jennifer 
      runs out into the parking lot with Ethan and Aiden closing 
      the distance.

      GLASS EXPLODES from a window above the awning and Kali FLIPS 
      down onto the pavement. Surprisingly, Jennifer stops short. 
      And when she turns around--

      It's not Jennifer. It s Allison.

      Argent emerges from the darkness, FIRING GUNS in both hands 
      at the surprised Alphas. 

      Allison raises a COMPACT CROSSBOW, sending flashbolts 
      BURSTING over the Twins blinding them. Side-by-side, the 
      Argents send the Alphas retreating back while--


      At the generators, Melissa throws a switch. An ELECTRIC HUM 
      signals the return of the building s backup power.


      Slamming through the door onto the rooftop, Scott whirls 
      about. But sees no one. No Jennifer. No Melissa.

                                  DEUCALION (O.S.)
                    They re gone.

      Deucalion emerges from the shadows.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                      Guardians, Scott. If you were with 
                    me, I could ve told you what it 
                    meant. I could ve warned you.

                                  SCOTT
                          (furious)
                    Then why didn t you?

                                  DEUCALION
                    Pack mentality. We help our own. 
                    Let me help you, Scott. Let s help 
                    each other. Help me catch her and 
                    I ll help you get your mother and 
                    Stiles s father back.

                                  STILES
                    Scott.

      He turns to see Stiles stepping out onto the rooftop.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Don t do it. Don t go with him.

                                  SCOTT
                          (barely a whisper)
                    I don t know what else to do.

                                  STILES
                    There has to be something. We 
                    always have a Plan B.

                                  SCOTT

                    Scott...

                                  SCOTT
                    I m going to find your Dad. I 
                    promise.

      Slowly, he turns away. As Stiles watches, Scott walks into 
      the darkness with Deucalion.
