  Tom s just finishing a call on his mobile.

                                BENNY
                  Tom! Tom wait! You need me!

  Tom stops - waiting for panting Benny to catch up.

                                TOM
                I don t need you. I can t get hold 
                of my dad. I need to get home. I 
                  need you to forget about everything 
                  you ve seen. 

                                BENNY
                  And you re going to take them on, 
                  yeah? The aliens?

                                TOM
                  Yeah.

                                BENNY
                  Wands against ray guns? Not sure 
                  how that s going to work out.

                                TOM
                  This is about Magic. That means 
                  it s down to me. It s my 
                  responsibility. Just go home, okay?

                                BENNY
                  What? I just saw an alien, I just 
                  saw one of our teachers taken over 
                by aliens. Your Gran got abducted 
                by aliens. Oh yes, and you turn out 
                to be a magician -

                                TOM
                  Wizard.

                                BENNY
                  And you want me to go home? But 
                  this is so WOW!

  Tom is serious, sober.

                                TOM
                  Well if you think this is all one 
                  big laugh, you re definitely not 
                  coming with me.

                                BENNY
                  You can t leave me behind. These 
                  are aliens, Tom. That s not hocus-
                  pocus - it s science. You need me.

  Tom considers. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



  FX SHOT: THE MOON - and behind it the NEKROSS ship.

  TOM and BENNY open their eyes - at the centre of the circle. 

                                BENNY
                  This looks sort of familiar. And 
                  nothing like a spaceship.

                                                                          CUT TO:



  TOM and BENNY still at the middle of the stones.

                We got bounced. 

                                BENNY
                  Bounced? 

                                TOM
                  Magic doesn t work against the 
                  Nekross. Maybe it doesn t work 
                  against their ship, either. 

                                BENNY
                So we got bounced? Here?

                                TOM
                  Maybe this is the last place on 
                  Earth the ship came. Maybe this is 
                as close as the spell could get us.

                                BENNY
                  Okay, so this wizard lost that ring 
                  here, what was he doing? Casting 
                  spells?

                                TOM
                  Raising the power of the stones. 

  Benny is getting inspired -

                                BENNY
                So that s what brought the aliens? 
                  What if we did the same? Brought 
                  the Nekross to us, like a trap. 

  Tom shakes his head, sad and frustrated.

                                TOM
                  Even if I knew how, I m out of 
                  spells  til the next sunrise. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



    Michael s car - hurtling along.

                                                                          CUT TO:



  TOM is sitting on the altar stone - defeated. BENNY is 
    awkward, unable to console him.

                                TOM
                I thought being a wizard was so 
                  cool. Like, a laugh. I could score 
                an impossible goal or, if I forgot 
                to do my homework, I could get it 
                  finished with a click of my 
                  fingers. My Dad tried to tell me it 
                  was more than that. That I needed 
                to take it seriously. But I never 
                  listened. And now look at us.

                                BENNY
                  Yeah. Back here, and I m stuck with 
                  you. Again.

  Tom looks at Benny. Manages half a smile.

                                TOM
                  And Magic and aliens - it s all 
                  real.

                                BENNY
                  Looks like we both learned 
                  something today.

  And it s a moment of bonding.

  FX SHOT: Lightning crackles between the stones around them.

                                BENNY (CONT D)
                  What was that?

  FX SHOT: More lightning, stronger.

                                TOM
                  The stones. Their Magic - it s 
                  coming to life.

                                BENNY
                  You said you couldn t do anything.

                                TOM
                  It s not me!

                                                                          CUT TO:

                                TOM

                  That is the best you ve got?

  FX SHOT: The ship hovers over the circle - massive

  FX SHOT: Tom and Benny disappear in the teleport beam.

  FX SHOT: Michael s 4x4 drives straight at the stone circle - 
  the spacecraft above it.

  FX SHOT: Straight into the teleport beam.

  The 4x4 standing at the centre of the circle. Smoking.

  BENNY staggers out, taking it all in. Joyful. Amazed.

                                BENNY
                We made it! We actually made it!

  TOM joins him.

                                TOM
                  Still think Magic is all Hogwarts?

    ROBERT and OLD MARK get out of the car. URSULA and MICHAEL 
  get out too.

                                OLD MARK
                  Was that sick, or what?

    ROBERT looks at his son, taken aback - to Ursula and Michael.

                                ROBERT
                  Kids. Where do they learn all this 
                  slang?

    Smiling sadly, he puts his arm around his ancient son. The 
    others watch, touched. As Tom digs out the Ring of Healing.

                                TOM
                  Maybe this will help.

    Robert is tearful as he takes it. Looks at Old Mark.

                                ROBERT
                  Thank you. It s my ring of healing, 
                  maybe it will.

  Old Mark s eyes are wet with tears.

                                OLD MARK
                  Blessed be the Source.

    Robert and Old Mark bow, and leave between the stones. Ursula 
    watches them go, then turns her eyes to the skies.

                                BENNY
                Do you think they re still up 
                  there? The Nekross.

                  You heard what the King said. They 
                  feed on Magic and there s none left 
                  anywhere else in the universe.

                  Every magical civilization they ve 
                  encountered, they ve destroyed. 

  He looks at Tom and Ursula frightened for them.

                                MICHAEL (CONT D)
                In the whole universe you re all

                If they want Magic, I m going to 
                  show them just what Magic can do. 
                  But this is about wizards, it s not 
                  your fight.

                                BENNY
                  You re my friend. That makes it my 
                  fight. 

  Tom looks up at the sky.

                                TOM
                  Over the centuries wizards have 
                  fought all kinds of creatures to 
                  keep the world safe - demons, 
                  ghouls, dragons, vampires. Now 
                  we re going to war again. But this 
                  time it s going to be different. 
                  It s wizards versus aliens. And I m 
                  ready for them.

  FX SHOT: Together they stand, looking out at the magnificent 
    sunset, its golden light pouring between the standing stones.

                                                                FADE TO BLACK.
