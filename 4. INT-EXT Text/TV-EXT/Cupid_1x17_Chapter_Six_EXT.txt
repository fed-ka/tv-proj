  The music plays on as Trevor delivers a huge bag for Hillary. 

                                LYRICS
                Cap n says to John Henry /  Gonna bring 
                me a steam drill  round / Gonna take dat 
                steam drill out on de job / Gonna whop 
                dat steel on down...  

                              HILLARY
                What is it? 

  Her lists off the items as he hands them to her. 

                                TREVOR
                  Anti-everythings.  One of each 
                  Psuedophedrine, loratadine, terfenadine --
                      (squints at a label)
                  sniffle-alazine hydrochloride...  You 
                allergic to all pets? 

                              HILLARY
                Yes, but it s mostly dander. 

  Trevor rummages through the bag.

                                TREVOR
                Thought we d focus on the Western 
                  medicine, but I threw in some homeopathic 
                hoodoo for good measure -- the literature 
                is a little sketchy, but some people 
                swear by it. 

                              HILLARY
                Okay.  It s a little scary -- if I d been 
                born before someone invented the inhaler, 
                  I wouldn t ve made it to age ten. 

                                TREVOR
                      (shakes his head)
                  Chamomile, eye bright, nettle, sepa, red 
                onion, ground loofah, sabadilla seed... 

  He dumps the rest of the bag s contents into her arms.  As he 
  leaves. 

                                TREVOR (cont d)
                Start taking.  We ll see you at four.  
                And don t worry -- we ll beat this steam 
                engine. 

  Hillary gives a curious look; Trevor is as focused as John 
  Henry must ve been. 

                                LYRICS
                John Henry tol  his Cap n / Lightin  was 
                in his eye /  Cap n bet yo  las  red cent 
                on me / Fo  I ll beat it to de bottom or 
                I ll die / Lord, Lord, I ll beat it to de 
                bottom or I ll die...  

  END MUSIC. 


  Harry, breathless, POUNDS on a door.  Julia answers.  She s 
  about to ask him a thousand questions, but he stops her, 
  first by placing a finger to her lips.  Then by kissing her.  
  (MUSIC:   John Henry  -- final verse.)

                                LYRICS
                Dey took John Henry to de graveyard / An  
                dey buried him in de sand / An  every 
                  locomotive come roarin  by / Says,  There 
                lays a steel-drivin  man / Lord, Lord, 
                there lays a steel-drivin  man.  

                              HARRY
                Just put some put some music on, okay?  
                The buzzing gets distracting. 

  Julia laughs, takes his hand, kisses it and pulls him inside.
