                    Just a couple of questions, before I
                    can authorize extending her benefits.

      Lucy's confused.  Drooling now.  Bobbing her head.  Re: Sally -

                                    LUCY
                    I don't like her.  She's fat.

      Luke flashes a nervous look to Sally, who nicely lets him
      off the hook; she's not offended.

                                      SALLY
                    I could lose a little weight.

      As Lucy rubs her right calf, distracted, CAMERA SLAMS IN:

      TIGHT - LUCY'S CALF - VFX

      PUSHING through fat, bone and muscle to discover a dangerous

      Lucy releases her calf --

                    Actually, before she signs --

                    It's okay.

      Sally sighs.  She wants to give the kid a break. 

                                      SALLY
                    I have questions about a couple of
                    these dates.  The first diagnosis --

                    And April 6.  That was her last day
                    of work.

                                    LUKE
                    The termination letter's dated March
                    5, I know, it's confusing, but yeah,
                    her last pay stub was for the week
                    ending April 6.

                                      SALLY
                    But she received unemployment benefits
                    that week.  A week she worked.

                                    LUKE
                    No.  That's a mistake.

      Off Luke, shook, grabbing a thick file, looking --

      Luke still looking.  It's got to be there.

                    It's a big problem, it could nullify
                    her entire claim.

                                    LUKE
                    We fixed that.  I know we did.  We
                    returned the money.

      Finally -- he's found what he needs.  He hands her a document.

                                    LUKE (CONT'D)
                    That's the canceled check... Not the
                    real one.  You know.  A copy.

                                      SALLY
                          (irony, a compliment)
                    And you're the dependent.

                    No, that's my little brother.  I'm
                    18.  Just helping out.

      A weird beat.  Sally looks at him.  Smiles.  STAMPS the form.

      WIDER - Lucy reacts, frightened and in pain, jerks her chair
      backwards.  Tense.

                                    LUKE
                    It's okay.  She just needs some water.

                    I'll get it.

      Sally moves off, Luke slips his Mom an airplane sized bottle
      of vodka.  She guzzles it.

                    -- The voices aren't real.

      Lucy nods.  Then she gasps, twists, in real pain, as CAMERA
      DIVES DOWN, and we're back --

      INSIDE HER BODY - VFX - THE BLOOD CLOT

      Slams through the chambers of her heart, and into a narrowing
      artery, crashing to a stop with a wet fat THUNK, blocking

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Quiet.  Luke paces, restless, past a MAN reading the COMICS. 
      When he lowers the paper, we see it's House.  Annoyed.

                                    LUKE
                          (a question)
                    This is a good hospital.

                    Depends what you mean by good.

                    I like these chairs.

      Off Luke's look, as House goes back to the comics --

      House ignores the page.  E.R. DOC WELLS enters, early 30s,
      Luke moves quickly towards him --

                                    LUKE
                    How is she?

                                      WELLS
                    Stable, okay.  Your mom had a small
                    pulmonary embolism, a blood clot
                    that got stuck in her lungs.  Blocked
                    the oxygen.

      Luke winces as he pulls out his notebook -- his wrist hurts. 
      (Throughout the following, House looks like he's just reading
      the paper, not paying attention.  Think again.)

                                    LUKE
                    But the pain started in her leg.

                          (nods, that's right)
                    Where the clot started.  Her calf. 
                    That's called a deep vein thrombosis,
                    basically a bigger clot --

                    -- it never hurt before, I would've
                    noticed --

                                      WELLS
                    -- A piece of that broke off, went
                    up the vein, through her heart, and
                    blocked blood flow to her lungs.  No
                    blood flow, no oxygen.

                          (writing fast)
                    Got it.  Wait a sec --

                                      WELLS
                    -- Is your dad here?  I have some

                    All right.  Your Mom's blood alcohol
                    was point one two, 10:30 in the

                          (flips through book)

                    Explains the DVT.  The alcohol makes

                                      WELLS
                    Fine.  She only drinks when you give
                    it to her.
                          (end of story)
                    We put her on blood thinners, you
                    can probably take her home tomorrow.

      Wells stands.

                    It's not the alcohol.  It's gotta be
                    something else.

                    DVT are immobility, injury to the
                    vein, or the blood itself.

      The team and Wilson.  Waiting.  Cameron opens an envelope
      from the MEDICAL SOCIETY OF NEW JERSEY.  The conversation
      proceeds as Cameron opens a form, looks at it, realizes,
      smiles to herself, and throws it away --

                    Some nurse saw him go in; maybe it
                    never happened; like the guy waking
                    up in Central Park without a kidney;
                    it's always a friend of a friend.

                                      WILSON
                    I saw him. 

      Beat.  They consider the significance of all this...

                    What's he gonna find out that we
                    couldn't?

      Wilson gives him a look - is that what this is?  A turf issue?

                                      WILSON
                    Think of it as calling in a
                      specialist.


      House standing now, leaning against the wall, as --

                    Because I like your voice.

      Lucy gives a short, barking laugh.  House sits back down.

                    Just rough.  They didn't hurt.

      Lucy wiggles her legs underneath the sheets.  House takes
      note...

                    Don't lie to him, Limpy.  Lively
                    Lucy never lies to Lucas.
                          (softer, serious)
                    Look what I do to him.
                          (beat)
                    Now.  My leg hurts now.
                          (beat, softer)
                    Yours too.


      As House approaches from the patient's room...

                    Learn anything from the human

      They look at each other:  that's it?

                    Also, for the last couple of months,
                    she hasn't shaved her legs, because
                    of the tremors, she cuts herself --

                    whole shebang. 

      Luke comes in, hands House his pager and a bagged sandwich.

                                    LUKE
                    No pickles.  And it's cold now.

      Luke goes off.

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Nice kid.  Keep her on the IV Heparin
                    to prevent future clotting, and take
                    her off the psych meds -- that way
                    we can see what's what on the physical
                    side, and who knows, we might get
                    more out of her.

      They move off.  Except for Cameron...  He takes a bite of
      his sandwich then notices her still standing there.

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry... no pickles.

      She debates, then:

                                      CAMERON
                    ...Happy birthday.

                                      HOUSE
                    Okay; whose?

      He really doesn't know what she's talking about, but Cameron
      thinks he just doesn't want to talk about it. 

                                      CAMERON
                    I was just going through your mail,

                    Just wanted to say it.  No big deal. 
                    It's a custom on this planet, you'll
                    catch on.

      Cameron leaves. 


      Foreman and a Nurse with a rack of blood tubes.

                                    LUCY
                    No blood.  Not mine.

                                      FOREMAN
                    For the tests, Dr. House told you
                    about them --

      Lucy SPITS in his face.

                                    LUCY
                    You're gonna steal it.  Sell it.

      As Foreman wipes his face, the Nurse presses a button.  A
      moment later, a couple of larger nurses enter --

                                      FOREMAN
                    Haldol, 5 milligrams, STAT.

                                    LUCY
                    No!

      As a Nurse produces a needle, Lucy struggles, terrified. 
      Foreman and two Nurses hold her down as --

                                    LUCY (CONT'D)
                    No... don't...

      She twists, sees the Haldol go into the IV.  Foreman watches
      her face go SLACK and DULL.  She stops struggling; he uncaps
      the needle to draw the blood...


      TERRI - mid-30's, fit, very attractive, in tight fashionable
      clothes, and WENDY, her ever so slightly overweight 12 year
      old daughter, who has a sore throat and wears baggy jeans. 
      House walks in as Terri adjusts Wendy's thin gold bracelet. 
      She's got a matching one.

                                      HOUSE
                    Really not strep.  The boys in the
                    lab, sure, they're hard drinkers,
                    but they're pros.  Plus your kid
                    actually has none of the symptoms
                    for strep; I just figured running
                    the test was easier than arguing
                    with you.  My point is: go.

                    and she's upset that I'm getting a

                    Well, I feel sorry for those other
                    kids, Wendy, because they don't have

                    sugar causes heart disease,
                      appendicitis, and athlete's foot.

                                      TERRI

      FADE IN:


      Foreman and House, mid argument, as --

                                      HOUSE
                    When I said no psych meds, I'm just
                    curious, which word didn't you
                      understand?

                                      FOREMAN
                    The Haldol had nothing to do with
                    the bleed, you know that; I used it
                    purely as a chemical restraint --

                    -- Great, good to know, then she

                    little side effects you get when
                    your motives aren't pure.

                          (give me a break)
                    Those side effects are rare and --

                      depression -- none of that's gonna
                    happen; none of that's gonna screw
                    up our diagnosis, because you just
                    used it to restrain her.  I am so
                    relieved.

      PULLING BACK THRU GLASS to...


      Cameron's there as Chase enters with a big envelope.  Foreman
      and House go at it, muffled, behind the glass.

                          (re: envelope)
                    The clotting studies.  Pretty fast,
                    you promise to date the whole lab?

                          (taking it from him)
                    No, I save that for emergencies.  I
                    told them the patient bled out two
                    units and if it happens again she'll
                    die.

      Chase sits down as Cameron opens the envelope.

                    If it had happened at home, she'd be

                    The ER Doc.  He was going to send
                    her home.

      Chase sees House and Foreman through the glass.  Gives Cameron
      a look re: House and Foreman --

                                      CAMERON
                    They're picking a movie.

                    Why did this patient bleed out?

      Cameron looks up from the results as --

                    The clotting studies.  So far they're
                    normal --

                          (off the looks)
                      I couldn't wait, I tried that crazy
                    new telephone gadget, I think it
                    could catch on.
                          (beat)
                    It's all normal, except for a
                    prolonged PT time.  What's that mean?

      Chase and Cameron look at Foreman, they know exactly what it
      means: Foreman screwed up.

                                      FOREMAN
                    Usually it means whoever drew the
                    blood didn't do it right.
                          (low, to Chase and

                    Oh, that's right, you drew the blood. 
                    But you were precise, because you
                    knew the tube was purely for the PT
                    study.

                    That's right.

                                      HOUSE
                    And I'm right with you.  I trust
                    this result.  For two reasons: a)
                    you are a good doctor and b) 5
                      milligrams of IV Haldol makes for a
                      spectacularly cooperative patient.
                          (waits, no response)
                    Fine, I'll go.  The prolonged PT
                    time makes me think she's got a
                    Vitamin K deficiency, which,
                      aggravated by the Heparin, caused
                    the bleed.

                                      FOREMAN
                    Fine, but it does nothing to explain
                    the DVT you're so curious about.
                          (mutters)

                    drug interacting with Heparin.  An
                      anti-biotic, like ampicillin.  That
                    could cause a bleed.  And some other

                    Alcohol fits the symptoms.  It causes
                      immobility, which explains the DVT. 
                    It also causes cirrhosis, which
                    explains the bleed and the prolonged

      Chase and Foreman move through a small hallway into a living
      room/bedroom, and into Lucy's bedroom.  It's neat, simple,
      sunny. 

      Foreman keeps moving (into a bathroom) as Chase sees a chest
      of drawers.  Chase opens a drawer and finds an entire outfit --
      shirt, shorts, underwear, socks -- as Foreman is in the
      doorway --

      Chase opens the refrigerator.  It's almost empty.  Then tries

                    Yesterday your patient's tumor was

      Lucy's sleeping.  Chase and Luke talk quietly in the corner. 
      Luke's got his notebook out --

                                      CHASE
                    It looks like the surgeon got it
                    all, but she's going to have to have
                    some chemotherapy --

                                    LUKE
                          (writing)
                    -- what kind is it? 

                                      CHASE
                    Stop.  Writing.

      Luke does.

                          (he knows...)
                    If you stop for a second it won't
                    all fall apart.  Give yourself a
                    break once in a while.  The fact is,
                    your Mom's gonna take an extra drink
                    once in awhile --

                                    LUKE
                    -- she won't, she doesn't --

                                      CHASE
                    Fine.

                    There are some things you can't fix,
                    that's all I'm saying.

      A beat.  Luke nods.  As if he gets it, but --

                                    LUKE
                    That's how you'd handle it.  Something
                    like this.  You'd give up.

      Not really surprised, Chase realizes Luke didn't hear any of
      it.

                                      CHASE
                    No.  I'd do it just like you.

      Chase pulls a chemo pamphlet from his coat, hands it to Luke
      and --

                    It's an infusion.

      She's in the doorway.  40ish, official looking.  Moving in,
      talking low, aware of the sleeping Lucy --

                    very tough living situation.  We
                    want to help him. 

                                    LUKE

                                    LUKE
                    I don't think so.

                    Not for the next few days.  Come on. 
                    Let's not make this difficult.

      Lucy stirs.  Luke looks at her.  Still asleep.  You can see
      it in his face -- he's smart, knows he has to go with them,
      but just might not do it.

                                    MALE TRUANT OFFICER (O.S.)
                    How we doin'?

      A uniformed TRUANT OFFICER in the doorway.  Implied muscle.

                                      TRINA WYATT
                          (at Luke, a question)
                    I think we're okay. 

      A tense beat.  Then, kissing his Mom on her forehead --

                                    LUKE
                          (whispers)
                    I love you, Mom.

      Lucy grabs his hand.  Her hand shakes on his.  She's awake.  

                                    LUCY
                    The Mets lost.  You remember?

                                    LUKE
                      I remember.

                                    LUCY
                    I love you.  

      Luke is crying.  Lucy closes her eyes, turns away.  Luke
      lets go of her hand, turns fast, blows by the Truant Officer,
      and leaves the room.  Trina Wyatt and the officer follow
      him, and, off Lucy alone in bed, and Chase...


      House and Wilson, mid-conversation, walking toward the
      elevators --

                                      WILSON
                    Cuddy hasn't said anything about
                    pushing Bergin to finish the surgery?

                                      HOUSE
                    Not a word.  Some kind of mind game. 
                    She's waiting for me to crack.

                                      WILSON
                    Either that or she's just being nice.

      House glances wryly to Wilson, then notices Luke come out of
      the elevators fast, pissed off, followed by Trina Wyatt and
      the Truant officer.  House stops.  He knows something's up.

                                      HOUSE
                          (not a chance of that)
                    Right.

      Ten feet away, Luke looks up, and House can see tears on his
      face.  House steps toward Luke, and, as Luke blows right by
      him (bumping him a little) --

                                    LUKE
                          (bitter)
                    You said you wouldn't call.  You're

                    Yeah, I get that a lot.

      House watches Luke head for the front door, trailed by the
      Truant Officer and Trina Wyatt.  TIGHT ON HOUSE, thoughtful,
      putting something together... Luke exits.  House turns to
      Wilson, and --

      FADE IN:


      Cuddy works.  House enters - there's something he's got to
      check out.

                                      CUDDY
                    What?

                                      HOUSE

      She goes back to her work.

                      ...Children's Services; they do nice
                    work; you did the right thing ratting
                    the kid out.

      She reacts - this reaction is what he came to see, and
      assess...

                                      CUDDY
                    You got me pegged as the anonymous

                    If in doubt, I always blame you.

      He continues to study her as:

                    None of my people even knew he was

                    gets them off the hook.  Tag, you're

                                      CUDDY
                    Never thought I'd say this to you,
                    but maybe you've gotten too involved
                    in this case.  On a personal level.

                    It's like you can see right through
                    me.  I feel so vulnerable.

      And he leaves.

                    I have gone about the house, gone up
                    and down.


      ON THE BOOK.  House reads from the collection of Yeats. 
      It's open to the page that's spattered in blood.

      REVEAL, he's reading to Lucy, who's still weak from the
      surgery, in bed, hooked up to a machine.  Eyes closed.

                    You called Social Services.  It was

                    No.  No no no.

      Her eyes are sharp.  Manic.

                                      HOUSE
                    It's okay.  I get it.  He'll have an
                    easier time dealing with the system. 
                    Sure, he won't be with his real
                    mother... but his real mother's sick.

                    Someone needs to take care of him.

                    I'm not gonna live here.

                    What would his future have been? 
                    Taking you to chemo and back on the
                    bus... He'll have to fit school in
                      somewhere, too.  And even if the
                    cancer's in complete remission, he'll
                    still have a mother who hears voices.

                                    LUCY

      She's got a little drool.  House wipes it off.

                          (re: the bedside phone)
                    I checked the phone records.  Only
                    one call from this room; smart, they
                    charge you two bucks a call.  It was
                    to Social Services, State of New
                    Jersey.

      Lucy's mouth stiffens in a schizophrenic smile.  A tear rolls
      down her cheek.  House gets up.

                    You're his mother.  You couldn't do

                    Good for you.

      Lucy closes her eyes.  House turns out the light, and leaves.


      Wilson and House, walk and talk away from House's office.

                          (not sure what to
                            expect)
                    How are you?

                                    LUCY
                    A little tired.  But good.  I feel
                    good now.

      She hugs him again.  Holds him extremely tightly --

                                    LUCY (CONT'D)
                          (very low)
                    I am so sorry.

                                    LUKE
                    Mom.

                                    LUCY
                    It's okay.

                                    LUKE
                    Mom.
                          (she's squeezing his
                            neck)
                    You're hurting me.

      She releases him.  Tears on her face.

                                    LUCY
                    Oh boy.
                          (beat)
                    You really need a haircut.

      And for the first time in years, Luke is a child again, in
      his mother's arms.  As a Nurse comes into the room with a
      wheelchair for checkout, Chase leaves.  Off Luke and his Mom --*


      Luke is pushing his mom's wheelchair, waiting for the
      elevator.  The door opens, revealing House and Wilson.

                                    LUCY
                    Dr. House.



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                HOUSE - Ep5502 - PINK - 7-27-04  62.

      Lucy's glad to see him.  Luke isn't, he's about to pull his
      Mom away, but --

                                    LUCY (CONT'D)
                    Luke, come on, we're making Dr. House
                    wait.

                                      HOUSE
                    It's okay.  He can get another ride.

                                    LUCY
                    Don't be silly.  Luke.

      It's been a long time since he's heard his Mom's voice like
      that.  They get on.  The doors close.


      An awkward beat.

                                    LUCY
                    I'm being discharged. 

                                      HOUSE
                    I heard a rumor.

                                    LUCY
                    Thank God I had cancer, huh?

      House smiles, knows what she's getting at.

                                    LUCY (CONT'D)
                    It's terrible having everybody think
                    you're nuts.

                                      HOUSE
                          (works for me)
                    Really?

                                    LUCY
                    I called to thank you, did you get
                    the message?

                                      HOUSE
                    Yes.
                          (thinks, then)
                    You're welcome.

      A beat.  The car's moving.  Lucy can't see House and Luke
      behind her, but she can HEAR, and REACT to:





                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                HOUSE - Ep5502 - PINK - 7-27-04  63.

                                    LUKE
                          (very low)
                    I'm never thanking you.  You turned
                    me in.

      Lucy looks a little worried.  Wilson wonders what's up too.

                                    LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I told you, we were doing okay, and
                    it was none of your --

                                      HOUSE
                    -- I don't care how you were living. 
                    I just wanted you out of my life.

      Lucy reacts, relieved that House is covering for her.  House
      glances to Wilson, then:

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    That's why I had Dr. Cuddy call Social
                    Services.

      DING.  The doors open.

                                    LUCY
                    Luke.  Come on.  Let's go.


      Luke pushes her out; House and Wilson step out behind them,
      watching them cross the lobby, heading for the doors...

                                      WILSON
                    You okay?

                                      HOUSE
                    ...You were right.  It wasn't the
                    DVT.  It was the schizophrenia.

                                      WILSON
                    I know.

                                      HOUSE
                    She's not nearly as interesting
                    anymore.

      HOLD House, alone, and --

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK:

                                      WILSON (V.O.)
                    Isn't your birthday around now?

                                            THE END
