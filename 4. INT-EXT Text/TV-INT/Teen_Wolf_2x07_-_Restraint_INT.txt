        A twenty-something named JESSICA slams a cabinet shut to get 
      her husband, SEAN s, attention.

                                    JESSICA
                    You promised this was only going to 
                    be for a few weeks.

                                  SEAN
                    Just because we re in a trailer 
                    doesn t mean we re trailer park 
                    trash.

                                    JESSICA
                    Exactly. We re worse. We don t even 
                    have enough money to be in a 
                    trailer park.

      Before Sean can respond the LIGHTS FLICKER and then go out.

                                  SEAN
                    Don t have a meltdown. It s 
                    probably just the generator.

                                    JESSICA
                    You mean the thing that runs the 
                      electricity and water?

      Pulling his jacket on, Sean pauses to notice the moonlit 
      tears glistening at her eyes.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                    I m sorry. I m just getting tired 
                    of feeling slightly terrified all 
                    the time. It s not like I want to 
                    be.

      Zipping up, Sean gives her a gentle kiss on the forehead.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/122.

                                  SEAN
                    It s going to get better.

      As he steps out, Jessica takes a seat at the dinette to wait. 
      After a moment, she glances up to notice barely a sound 
      coming from outside the trailer. 

      Just the soft whisper of the wind.

                                    JESSICA
                          (calling out)
                    Sean?

      She rises to peer out the windows. Moving from one to the 
      next, she pauses and leans closer to the glass.

      Several yards away, Sean talks to SOMEONE in the darkness, a 
      STRANGER IN A HOODIE. They seem to be arguing. Sean s hands 
      come up in a placating gesture. But the Stranger gives a 
      shake of the head and then, oddly, peers up to the treetops.

      As Jessica watches, Sean follows the Stranger s gaze and--

      SOMETHING GRABS HIM, literally snatching Sean right off his 
      feet, yanking him into the darkness above.

      Jessica SHRIEKS, a piercing sound that s cut short as her 
      hands cover her mouth.

      The Stranger still peers into the trees, watching the 
      rustling branches. Then slowly, he turns and POINTS A FINGER 
      at the trailer.

      Pointing right at Jessica.

      Staggering back, she fumbles for the door and locks it. Then 
      quickly latches every window. When she peers out again--

      The Stranger is gone.

      Jessica s eyes dart to the pockets of darkness in her field 
      of view but she can t seem to find him. 

      Silence bears down on her. Until she hears a breeze and gazes 
      up in horror to see she's forgotten to lock the SKYLIGHT.

      Hand trembling, she cautiously reaches up. Just as her 
      fingers wrap around the lever--

      THE DINETTE WINDOW SMASHES INWARD. 

      Sean s body topples across the table, eliciting an ear-
      piercing SCREAM from Jessica.           TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/123.

        CONTINUED:22

      But then the body RIPS back out leaving a gaping hole in the 
      trailer. 

      Gasping, Jessica watches a strange shape approach the window.

      TRANSLUCENT CLAWS appear at the edges of the broken glass. A 
      scaled hand reaches in and the Kanima slithers inside the 
      trailer, moving stealthily toward her.

      As Jessica presses back in terror, the creature closes in on 
      her. Baring double-rowed teeth, it... pauses. 

        A previously unseen detail about Jessica now becomes visible: 
      She s pregnant, clearly in her last trimester.

      As she squeezes her eyes shut, the creature focuses on the 
      shape of her stomach, gazing at it with an odd curiosity.

      Claws CLICKING across the floor of the trailer, the creature 
      retreats back. It turns, and in one swift movement, 
      disappears out the broken window. 

      Jessica blinks her eyes open to realize she s not only alone 
      in the trailer, but alive and unharmed.

      She GASPS, hand clutching her stomach as a CONTRACTION 
      shudders through her. Lurching forward, she CRIES OUT with a 
      SCREAM. 

      A scream of both pain and terror.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      Alone in the Sheriff s office, Stiles and Scott crowd around 
      Stiles s phone to listen to Allison s voice over the speaker.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    If Jackson doesn t know what he s 
                    doing then he probably doesn t know 
                    someone s controlling him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Or doesn t remember.

                    What if it s the same kind of thing 
                    that happened to Lydia when she 
                    took off from the hospital?          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/124.

                    A fugue state.


      Jackson stands in his bedroom, naked and with an oddly vacant 
      look in his eyes. Blood drips from his claws as they retract 
      back into his fingers.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    He d have to forget everything. The 
                    murder, coming home...


      With that same dull stare, Jackson lets the hot water wash 
      the blood off his hands and body.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)

      Lying back in bed, Jackson sets his head on the pillow and 
      gently falls asleep.

                    But he had help with one thing. The 
                    video.

      RED LIGHT glowing, Matt s camera records Jackson from its 
      perch on the tripod. Until a GLOVED HAND reaches in to press 
      the STOP button.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    Someone else helped him forget 
                    that...


      Scott looks up from Stiles s phone.

                                  SCOTT
                    Whoever s controlling him.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    Are you sure Jackson has no clue 
                    about any of this?

                                  STILES
                    He thinks he s still becoming a 
                    werewolf and that being with Lydia 
                    somehow delayed the whole thing.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/125.

                    So do we try to convince him he s 
                    not?

                                  SCOTT
                    If it helps us figure out who s 
                      controlling him, then yeah.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    You think he ll talk to us after 
                    what we did?

                                  STILES
                    Yeah. Totally.
                          (to Scott)
                    Right?


      Stiles and Scott sit at a table in the interrogation room, 
      listening to Stilinski who reads from a clipboard.

                                  STILINSKI
                    You will not go within fifty feet 
                    of Jackson Whittemore. You will not 
                    speak to him. You will not approach 
                    him. You will not assault or harass 
                    him physically or psychologically.

      Stilinski glances to Mr. Whittemore who nods with 
      satisfaction. 

      Beside them, Melissa McCall simply tries to keep her weary 
      head propped up with a hand.

                                  STILES
                    What about school?

                                  STILINSKI
                    You can attend classes while 
                      maintaining a fifty foot distance.

                                  STILES
                    What if we both have to go to the 
                    bathroom at the same time and 
                    there s only two stalls right next 
                    to each other?

      Stilinski aims a glare of white-hot rage at his son.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I ll just hold it.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/126.



      Outside the interrogation room, Stilinski tries to keep from 
      strangling Stiles.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Do I need to remind you how lucky 
                    we are they re not pressing 
                    charges?

                                  STILES
                    It was a joke. I didn t know it 
                    would be taken this seriously. 
                    Humor s very subjective, Dad. We re 
                    talking multiple levels of 
                      interpretation.

                                  STILINSKI
                    And how exactly should I interpret 
                    the stolen Prison Transport Van?

                                  STILES
                          (lamely)
                    We filled the tank.

      As Stilinski glares in silent fury, Melissa pulls Scott down 
      the corridor past them.

                                    MELISSA
                    It s not just this. Although, a 
                      restraining order is a low I didn t 
                    think you d reach quite this soon. 
                    It s everything on top of it. The 
                      completely bizarre behavior, the 
                    late nights coming home, having to 
                    beg Mr. Harris to let you make up 
                    the Chemistry test you missed.

                                  SCOTT
                    I missed a Chemistry test?

                                    MELISSA
                    Really, Scott? Really?

      With his father back in the interrogation room, Stiles turns 
      to watch Melissa explode.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    I have to ground you. I m grounding 
                    you. You re grounded.

                    Fine. Other than work. And no TV.

                                  SCOTT
                    The TV s broken.

                                    MELISSA
                    Then no computer.

                                  SCOTT
                    I need my computer for school.

                                    MELISSA
                    Then no...
                          (desperate)
                    No Stiles.

                                  STILES
                    No Stiles?

                                    MELISSA
                    No Stiles!

      He flinches back as she practically takes his head off.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                          (to Scott)
                    And no more car privileges. Give me 
                    your key.

      Scott hands over his keys. Trying to pry the car key off, 
      Melissa can t get the steel ring to pull back far enough to 
      release it.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    Oh, for the love of God...

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom, let me do it. Mom? Mom, will 
                    you just--Mom.

      He takes her hands in his. Still gripping the keys, Melissa 
      meets his concerned gaze.

                                    MELISSA
                    What s going on with you? Is this 
                    about Allison?

      Behind her, Stiles vehemently shakes his head.

                    Yes.

      While Stiles continues shaking his head, Scott almost seems 
      ready to tell her, lips pressed together as if trying not to 
      let the secret out.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    Is it about your father?

      Behind her, Stiles nods furiously. Almost to where it looks 
      like his head might literally snap off his body.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    It is, isn t it?

      Finally, Scott nods. He gently takes the key ring out of her 
      hands and pulls the car key off. As he hands it over, he 
      notices the tears welling at her eyes.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    Okay, we ll talk about it at home. 
                    I ll bring the car around.

      As she steps away, Stiles takes her place at Scott s side.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m the worst son ever.

                    Yeah, I m not winning any prizes 
                    either.

      He nods to the window of the interrogation room where they 
      see Mr. Whittemore ripping into Stilinski, face reddening as 
      he shouts and jabs an angry finger at the Sheriff.

      Scott and Stiles turn away to face an even more unpleasant 
      sight--

      Jackson. 

      Sitting on a bench in the waiting area, he smiles at them. A 
        particularly self-satisfied smile.

      Morning light pours in through the library windows over 
      Allison as she steps inside. She throws a glance at one of 
      the wall cameras and then walks into the book stacks out of 
      its view.

      Unzipping her bag, she removes a PANTECH ELEMENT TABLET. As 
      casually as possible, she places the tablet between the books 
      on a shelf.

      ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STACK - Scott takes the tablet. With 
      Stiles peering over his shoulder, he taps the screen to look 
      over a page of the Bestiary and the translation next to it.

      On her side of the shelf, Allison opens a book, trying to 
      look inconspicuous as she whispers to them.

                    It s everything Lydia could

                                    ALLISON
                    Not really. But Stiles was right 
                    about murderers. It calls the 
                    Kanima a weapon of vengeance. 
                    There s a story in there about a 
                    South American priest who used the 
                    Kanima to execute murderers in his

                    Here s the thing, though. The 
                    Kanima s actually supposed to be a 
                    werewolf. But it can t be until...

      Allison pauses as a TEACHER passes by the stacks. But Scott 
      picks up the reference from the tablet.

                    You ve got a make-up exam,

                    to concentrate on not failing out 
                    of high school. Otherwise, you re 
                    not going to be helping anyone.

      Scott looks to Stiles who nods, backing her up.

                    Promise me.

      She reaches a hand between the books, taking his. Just her 
      touch has an immediate effect on him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay. But if Jackson does anything, 
                    you run the other way.

                    Anything evil.

      Allison nods, then pushes his face back. As the books fall in 
      to fill the empty space--


      A door clicks open.

      Backpack over his shoulder, Jackson wanders into the darkened 
      Biology classroom. He glances to the time on his phone, 
      sighing with typical impatience.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1213.

      But then he turns to the ANIMAL CAGES, almost as if drawn to 
      them. Moving alongside, he finds a WHITE RABBIT in one, 
      TURTLES in another, and in the last...

      A SNAKE.

      Standing over the cage, Jackson seems oddly mesmerized by the 
      reptile slithering among wood chips inside. 

      His bag falls to the floor beside his leg, almost as if he 
      could no longer manage the weight of it.

      Reaching up, Jackson lifts the lid of the cage. As he lowers 
      a hand inside, the snake responds immediately, casually 
      slithering onto his palm. Moving with a surprising swiftness. 
      It glides up his arm, wraps over his shoulder, around his 
      neck and--

      Slides right into his open mouth. Literally disappearing down 
      his throat.

                                    BIOLOGY TEACHER
                    Jackson?

      He turns to see the Biology Teacher entering the classroom.

                    Did you still want to discuss your 
                    paper?

      Jackson nods. Stepping away, he reveals the lid is now 
      closed. Inside, all that can be seen are wood chips in an 
      otherwise empty cage.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      Alone among a sea of desks, Scott gazes down at the 
      complicated equations covering the first page of the test and 
      takes a nervous swallow.

      Jackson spins the dial on his locker, resetting the 
      combination to unlock it while paying little attention to

                    Fine. And by the way, nothing as in

                    That s your locker.

      Jackson glances from the locker he's been trying to open to 
      the one Lydia points out across the hall. She watches his 
      expression as it changes from bewilderment to fear.

      At the same time, neither of them notice the CAMERA above 
      slowly adjusting its view, focusing and refocusing its lens 
      on the teenagers below.


      In the hallway, Melissa passes by the open door of Scott's 
      bedroom. But then stops and inches her way back.

      She disappears from the doorway. Then reappears. Then steps 
      inside. Then steps back out. Then steps in.

                    Just some cleaning. A little bit of 
                    cleaning. Then I m gone.

      She picks up a few articles of clothing from the floor and 
      starts to walk out, satisfied. But then stops at the door.

      With a sigh, she turns around and begins gently looking 
      through Scott s things. But gently becomes uncontrollable 
      frenzy as she searches every inch of the room until finally--

      Melissa sits at Scott s desk, facing a terrifying sight for a 
      mother: An open box of CONDOMS. A box of 12.

      Treating it like a vial of unstable nitroglycerin, she picks 
      it up and tips it over. One condom falls out. Only one.

      Pencil pressed to paper, Scott fills in bubbles as fast as he 
      can, racing to finish the test while the clock above Harris 
      TICKS and TICKS and--


      HEELS CLICK across the corridor floor, a sound that catches 
      Jackson s attention. He pauses to turn around. 

      The CLICKING stops. In the otherwise empty corridor, Jackson 
      starts forward again as--

      Allison appears around the corner, now holding her HIGH HEELS 
      in her hand. Ahead, she sees Jackson stopped in the middle of 
      the corridor, hands to his head as if overcome by a migraine.

      closes the distance, reaching for the door just as it SWINGS

      She realizes she s still holding her high heels.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh. They were hurting my feet.

                                  MATT
                    Same reason I never wear mine.

      She doesn t seem to hear him while putting them back on.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Okay. So that wasn t funny.

                                    ALLISON
                    What?

                                  MATT
                    Forget it. Um... Hey, did you hear 
                    about the underground show? I guess 
                    they ve got some big name spinning.

                                    ALLISON
                    You mean like a rave?

                                  MATT
                    Is it still a rave if you don t 
                    roll? I just call it a concert. 
                    I ve got a hook-up for tickets if 
                    you re down. Should I grab you one?

      Still trying to see past him into the locker room, she 
      glances back to find him waiting for a reaction.

                                    ALLISON
                    Yeah. Great.

                                  MATT
                    All right, cool. It s Friday.

      She gives a tentative nod as he walks off. As the realization 
      that she may have just said yes to a date hits her, she turns 
      to call him back.

      But A CRY OF PAIN erupts from inside the locker room.

                                    ALLISON
                    Jackson?

      Hand on the door, she slowly pushes it open.


      THE BELL RINGS and Lydia hurries out of class with Stiles 
      following right behind her.

      She starts off again. As he goes after her, they pass Erica. 
      Watching the two of them with interest, she begins to follow.


      Standing just inside the door, Allison cautiously glances 
      about the empty locker room. RUNNING WATER catches her ear.

                                    ALLISON
                    Jackson?

                                    JACKSON (O.S.)
                    In here.

      His voice is oddly monotone. Allison takes a few apprehensive 
      steps past the sinks to find Jackson standing under a shower, 
      completely NAKED. With an embarrassed gasp, Allison turns 
      away.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Something wrong?

                    You could ve warned me.

                                    JACKSON
                    You re the one who walked into the 
                    Boy s Locker Room.

                    I thought I heard--I thought you 
                      were--forget it.

      She tries not to glance at him as he turns the shower off. 
      Dripping wet, he crosses in front of the sinks, strategically 
      positioning himself between her and the door.

                                    JACKSON
                    You want to talk about something?

                    It can wait.

      She starts for the door, but he takes a step to block it.

                    Lydia, wait. Lydia--

      A hand comes out of the crowd to shove him back against the 
      wall. Erica, CLAWS out. She presses the tips into his chest.

                                  ERICA
                    Why are you asking Lydia about 
                    Jackson s real parents?

                                  STILES
                    Why are you bringing out the claws 
                    on camera?

      Stiles nods to the CAMERA on the wall behind Erica. She drops 
      her hand from its view.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    That s right. You want to play 
                    Catwoman? I ll be your Batman.

      He shrugs past her, moving into the flow of students.

                    If you want to find his parents 
                    they re about a half mile from

      Allison backs toward the lockers as Jackson continues a slow, 
      almost methodical approach.

                                    ALLISON
                    I have to get to class.

                                    JACKSON
                    No, you don t. You have perfect 
                    grades. You can skip one class.

      Allison holds still, eyes darting to the door.

                    You okay? Your heart s beating like 
                    crazy. I can hear it all the way 
                    over here.

      Water drips from Jackson s fingertips at his sides, puddling 
      at his feet. Until ONE DROP on his index finger refuses to 
      break free. Instead, it stretches like syrup. Or more 
        correctly... VENOM.

      Approaching 1:00pm, the clock s TICKING pushes into Scott s 
      head, causing his hearing to sharpen its supernatural focus.

      When he presses his pencil back down to the answer sheet, the 
      LEAD TIP SNAPS with the BANG of a SHOTGUN BLAST.

      Then, Scott gradually lifts his eyes from the test as an all-
        too-familiar HEARTBEAT pounds its way into his ears with the 
      intensity of a frantic alarm.

      Allison s heart.

      As the second BELL RINGS for the start of class, Stiles now 
      finds himself hurrying after Erica.

                                  STILES
                    Do you know how they died?

                    Maybe. If you tell me why you re so 
                      interested.

      She pauses to gauge his reaction. His hesitation.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    It s him, isn t it?

                    What? Who? Him who?

                    The test didn t work, but it s 
                    still him. It s Jackson.


      Scott drops the test on Harris's desk with more than a dozen 
      bubbles on the answer sheet still empty.

                                  HARRIS

                    I don t care. You re not leaving 
                    until every single one of those 
                    bubbles is filled in.

      Grabbing his pencil, Scott begins filling in bubbles. All 
      B s. Before Harris can protest, he slaps the pencil down, 
      grabs his bag and hurtles out the door.


      Taking another step back, Allison s eyes stay fixed on the 
      paralytic toxin dripping from Jackson s nails as they sharpen 
      to CLAWS.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1223.

                    I changed my mind.

      She eases toward the door to Coach s office as a naked 
      Jackson slowly approaches.

                                    JACKSON
                    You sure? Because you look a little 
                    stressed. Is it Scott? Is it that 
                    whole thing?

      Reaching the door, Allison tries the handle. It s locked.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    To be honest, I still can t believe

      Allison inches back as he presses forward.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    You know he s eventually going to

                                    ALLISON
                    Stop. Just stop.

      But he keeps coming forward.

                                    JACKSON
                    What are you going to do, Allison, 
                    when your stupid bitch of a

      She darts toward the door, but Jackson s hand comes up fast, 
      arm blocking her in.

      Jackson s claws ease toward her face, finding the delicate 
      skin of her throat.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)

                      Actually... he has.

      Allison s hands come up, pushing his arms out and away as she 
      RAMS her palm RIGHT INTO HIS THROAT.

      Choking, Jackson stumbles back. But one hand hooks into the 
      strap of her bag and he manages to drag her to the floor. 
      They land hard, bodies SMACKING against cement. 

      As Allison scrambles back in retreat--

                                    JACKSON
                    Allison?

      He looks at her, confused, a complete change in his demeanor. 
      Realizing he's naked, he grabs for a pair of shorts.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    What are you doing in here?

      Allison stares at him, incredulous. Somehow he's the 
      vulnerable one now. Before she can respond--

      The door CLANGS open and Scott steps in to witness the 
      disturbing sight of Jackson pulling his shorts on while 
      Allison rises from the floor across from him.

                                    ALLISON
                    I m fine--I m fine.

      But Scott whirls toward Jackson. Dropping his bag to the 
      floor, he's suddenly moving, grabbing Jackson by the arms and 
      lifting him right off his feet.

      The half naked Jackson literally SOARS across the room, 
      SLAMMING to a crashing halt against the lockers. A second 
      later, however, he snaps his head up with a furious glare.

                    Trust me. I restrained myself.

      Jackson picks himself up, muscles tensing. He charges, moving 
      with alarming speed. Scott tries to grab him, but he s too 
      fast and too slippery.

      Allison scrambles back as Scott SOARS PAST her, thrown into 
      the shower, his body cracking brutally against the tile.

      Apparently, Scott's not the only one with super strength. But  
      then he picks himself up off the shower floor, wet and 
      severely pissed off. 

      It s on.

      Allison can only watch as they collide, pummelling each 
      other. The blows come with savage brutality. It's a tile 
      smashing, floor scratching, ceiling bashing cage match.

      From the opposite end of the locker room Jackson picks up a 
      35 POUND BARBELL PLATE. He tosses it like a frisbee.

      Incredibly, Scott catches it in both hands. But when he 
      lowers the weight, he gets a fist to the face. He crashes 
      back into a SINK, snapping it right off the wall.

      WATER JETS out from the broken pipe, dousing the floor.


      Erica rounds the corner with Stiles right behind her.

      Stiles s eyes focus on WATER seeping into the corridor from 
      underneath the door to the locker room which--

      The fight between a now soaked Scott and Jackson bursts into 
      the corridor. Stiles and Erica quickly find themselves caught 
      in the middle.

      Allison comes through the door as a group of students gather 
      to watch the fight. Even Matt appears as--

                                  STILES
                    Scott, Scott!

      He steps in front of his best friend as Erica grabs hold of 
      Jackson. Still struggling, he knocks Matt to the floor right 
      beside Scott s bag.

                                  HARRIS
                    What the hell s going on?

      Matt notices Scott s bag at his feet. The PANTECH TABLET has 
      slid out. He picks it up out of the puddle of water and taps 
      the screen to find it still works. Then finds something else 
      curious on it: a page from the Bestiary.

                                  HARRIS (CONT D)
                    Enough!

      As Harris breaks up the fight, Matt quickly e-mails the 
      Bestiary file to himself from the tablet. Scott turns to 
      notice him just as the file soars off the screen.

                                  MATT
                    I think you dropped this.

      But Harris grabs the tablet out of his hand. He uses it to 
      point at Scott and Jackson.

      Looking up from a screen of multiple security camera views, 
      Victoria Argent notices Melissa McCall standing at the door.

                    Me?

      As Melissa nods, in one of the SECURITY VIEWS, Lydia can be 
      seen at her locker gathering her things.


      Shutting the locker, Lydia turns to face the Junior.

                    slightly rapey language.

      With a smile, the Junior starts off down the hall.

      Scott maintains a furious glare on Jackson as Stiles pulls 
      him to another table.

                                  SCOTT

      At another table, Allison notices Erica watching Stiles and 
      Scott with interest, while past her--

      Matt clicks on his laptop to view the pages from the 
      Bestiary. He looks over the strange text with curiosity, 
      guiding the cursor to one particular word.

      While Harris grades tests at the librarian s desk, Stiles

                    The guy bugs me. I don t know why.

      They both look over to see Matt eating from a bag of potato 
      chips. He offers a chip to Jackson beside him. Jackson just 
      glares. Matt shrugs and keeps eating.

      Back at his table, Jackson puts a hand to his head, gritting 
      his teeth in pain. He raises his free hand toward Harris.

      Concerned, Harris watches him disappear into the Boy s Room.


      Wincing in pain, Jackson approaches the sinks. He reaches 
      over to turn on the water, but then his hand snaps to his 
      eye.

      Opening his mouth in a silent scream, his knees buckle as a 
      jolt of pain almost sends him to the floor.

      His head lurches up and he looks at his reflection to see his 
      RIGHT EYE bulging outward as if something presses against it 
      from inside his skull.

      TINY BLOOD DROPLETS spatter the mirror, eliciting a terrified 
      breath from Jackson. Blood at his lower eyelid, something 
      begins to push its way through the tear-duct.

      THE HEAD OF A SNAKE.

      Somehow still alive and struggling out of Jackson s head. A 
      stream of blood slips down his cheek. 

      Gripping the sides of his head with his hands, a horrified 
      Jackson watches the SNAKE finally wriggle free and drop down 
      into the sink.

      It disappears into the drain with a last flick of its tail, 
      leaving Jackson gasping and staring into a black abyss.

      Scott steps into the waiting area of the Principal's office. 
      He flinches at the grating sound of an ELECTRIC PENCIL 
      SHARPENER. Then spots Victoria behind her desk as she pulls a 
      pencil from the sharpener to admire its new point.

                                  SCOTT
                    The Principal wanted to see me?

                                  VICTORIA
                    No, I did.

      She takes another pencil from the package and pushes it into 
      the electric sharpener while she speaks.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    I m concerned about the detention 
                    today and how Allison ended up in 
                    there with you and Mr. Stilinski.

                    I know. And it was my fault.

                                  VICTORIA
                      Obviously. A sink was ripped off

                    I do now.

                    Good. Are you having sex with my 
                    daughter?

      Scott holds very still. Doesn t even breathe.

      Eyes on him, she pushes the pencil into the sharpener. And 
      keeps pushing, GRINDING it down, literally to the eraser. She 
      takes out the now tiny bit and sets it down on the desk.

                                  VICTORIA
                      I certainly hope not.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1235.



      Huddled together in one of the stacks, Scott, Stiles, Erica 
      and Allison whisper as they quickly shelve books.

                                  STILES
                    It means he was born after his 
                    mother died. By C-section. They had 
                    to pull him out of her dead body.

                    You okay, dude?

      With oddly labored breaths, Jackson gives a slow nod. Then 
      reaches for the next book while through the spaces between 
      shelves he can see Allison whispering to the others.

                                    ALLISON
                    So was it an accident or not?

                    But for Jackson? Or for whoever s 
                      controlling him?

      AT HIS ROW, Jackson sets another book on the shelf. 
      Strangely, the title on the spine is his own name: JACKSON.

      He blinks and his name disappears, replaced by: MODERN 
        INTERPRETATIONS ON GREEK MYTH. 

      The next book he picks up reads: CLOSE YOUR EYES JACKSON. He 
      blinks again. For a moment, the title reads: A TALE OF TWO 
      CITIES. But then changes to: CLOSE THEM NOW.

      While Matt continues shelving the books nearby, Jackson s 
      eyes slowly flutter closed.

      A FEW ROWS DOWN - Scott steps back from the others.

                                  SCOTT
                    We have to talk to him. We have to

                    He s not going to listen--

      But Scott s already moving away from their row and toward 
      Jackson s. He pauses, however, when he sees something odd.

      AN OPEN BOOK sits outside the row. And just beyond it lies 
      Matt, face down on the floor, a thin SLASH at the back of his 
      neck.

      WITH A BURST of GLASS and SPARKS, a LIGHT above goes out.

                                  SCOTT
                    Erica!

      as Scott whirls around, eyes GLOWING, teeth fanged and claws 
      out.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1237.

      Something moves above the stacks, leaping and bounding across 
      them, LIGHTS BURSTING AND SHATTERING. Stiles and Allison back 
      away as SPARKS fall.

                                  STILES
                    Look out--

      But the DARK FIGURE racing between the rows is too fast. 
      Erica tumbles to the floor, a hand to the back of her neck.

      Scott whirls around to find Jackson standing in front of him. 
      Arms covered in scales, mouth filled with a double-row of 
      teeth, he s half-in and half-out of the transformation.

      Scott launches up to attack but Jackson is far more powerful. 
      He tosses Scott into a book cart with ease.

      The library goes quiet. Breathless, Stiles and Allison glance 
      around. Back to normal, Scott peers up from the pile of 
      books. The three of them spot Jackson--

      Standing at an EASEL CHALK BOARD. His head lolls to the side, 
      eyes a blank WHITE. No irises. His arm slowly lifts up. He 
      looks like a marionette being controlled by unseen strings.

      Chalk in his clawed hand, Jackson begins writing on the 
      board. Head never turning to see what he's doing, it looks 
      like someone is using his body, controlling it to send a 
      hastily scrawled threat:

      Stay out of my way. Or I'll kill all of you.

      The chalk falls to the floor. Head swiveling to look at them 
      with a glowing-eyed stare, Jackson darts forward. Hands 
      hitting the carpet as he drops to all fours, he leaps up--

      AND SMASHES through the window of the library.

      As Scott and Allison come forward, Stiles gathers the 
      paralyzed Erica into his arms. Except she s beginning to 
      shake, tremors rippling through her body.

                                        ACT SIX

      FADE IN:


      Between the stacks, Stiles tries to keep Erica on her side as 
      her body wrenches and twists with violent spasms. Nearby, 
      Allison pulls Matt onto his back.

                                    ALLISON
                    He s alive.

      Scott turns to Erica, her seizure seeming far worse than the 
      one they witnessed in gym class.

                                  STILES
                    We need to get her to a hospital.

      Erica s hand latches around Stiles s wrist.

                      Derek--only to Derek.

      Allison turns at the words, almost jolted by them.

                    When we get to the hospital--

                    To Derek.

      Allison gauges Scott s reaction, the look of conflict on him.

                                    ALLISON
                    Go.

                    This doesn t feel right.

                          (almost reassuring herself)

                    Scott, go. Go.

      Finally, Scott begins helping Stiles lift the shaking Erica 
      off the floor of the library. As they move for the door--

      A CAMERA above turns with an ELECTRIC WHIR, focusing its lens 
      to watch them.

      Watching everything.


      Stepping around a corner in the empty house, an increasingly 
      nervous Lydia pauses when-- 

                                  JUNIOR (O.S.)
                    Over here.

      She turns to find the Junior in the middle of an empty room 
      wearing an oddly expectant smile. 

                                  LYDIA
                    This is your house?

                                  JUNIOR
                    It was. I ll tell you all about it. 
                    But first, did you bring the 
                    flower?

                                  LYDIA
                      I couldn t find it.

                                  JUNIOR
                    That s okay. But since you don t 
                    have it, I m going to need 
                    something else.

      His hands delicately reach for her bare arms, pulling them 
      gently toward him.

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    I m going to need that kiss.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1240.

        CONTINUED:41A41A

      The gentleness drops away as he yanks her body close and 
      kisses her. It's sudden and strangely passionate. Lydia 
      tenses at first. But then completely gives into it, utterly 
      letting go. 

      As the Junior s hands grip her, fingers pressing into the 
      small of her back, she returns the kiss. And the world begins 
      to tilt and turn like a merry-go-round slipping off its 
      track.

      Spinning faster and faster as Lydia opens her eyes to realize 
      she s no longer kissing a handsome young Beacon Hills Junior. 

      She s kissing the burned, decimated face of Peter Hale.

      Lydia pulls her lips from Peter s. As she staggers back, the 
      white walls of the house begin to age, charring and 
      blackening right before her eyes, transforming to reveal the 
      house she s actually been in the whole time...

      The Hale House.

      Peter stands in front of her, nearly every inch of his body 
      burned down to muscle tissue.

                                  PETER
                    Something wrong?

      Lydia SCREAMS. And flashes back to the first moment she saw 
      the Junior--


      Lydia looks out from her seat in Ms. Morrell s office to see 
      the Junior. When she blinks. The seat is empty. No one there.


      Lydia approaches the trophy case with its portraits of 
      athletes. Her eyes focus on one young man. The Junior. The 
      name underneath his picture...

      Peter Hale.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1241.



      Back hitting the wall, Lydia crumbles to the floor. Her 
      terrified eyes peer out with a distant, glazed look. The look 
      of someone who can no longer discern the real from the 
      imagined.


      Scott and Stiles arrive with Erica, carrying her into the 
      station. She now barely moves. Just tight, strained breaths 
      coming from between her pale lips.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek? Derek!

      TWO RED EYES hurtle out from the shadows like focused lasers. 
      Boots landing with a powerful thud on the cement, Derek 
      kneels down to pick Erica up.

                                  DEREK
                    Follow me.


      Inside the train, Derek directs a light over Erica s arm 
      while Scott and Stiles look on.

                                  STILES
                    Is she dying?

                    She might. Which is why this is 
                    going to hurt.

      Grabbing her arm in his hands, he presses down on it, 
      BREAKING it. Erica SCREAMS in agony.

                                  STILES
                    You broke her arm?

                                  DEREK
                    It ll trigger the healing process. 
                    I also have to get the venom out. 
                    That s the part that s going to 
                    hurt.

      Hands gripped around her broken arm, Derek presses down. As 
      Erica SHRIEKS, BLOOD infused with the viscous Kanima venom 
      spills across the floor.

      Erica collapses into Stiles s arms. Her eyes blink as she 
      fights to stay conscious while looking up at him.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1242.

      Pushing the hair from her face, he gazes on her with the kind

                    And we do it my way.


      The window EXPLODES over the dinette, sending Jessica 
      scrambling back as her husband s body smashes in. Her SCREAM 
      of terror becomes--

                    It killed Sean...

                                    MELISSA
                    The police know.

                                    JESSICA
                    They don t... they didn t see it.

      Melissa meets the girl s eyes, seeing the conviction in them.

                                    JESSICA (CONT D)
                          (barely audible)
                    It wasn t human.

      Jessica s hand slips from Melissa s arm. She helps ease the 
      girl back.

      THE LIGHTS click off and Jessica s eyes fall closed. The 
      sound of the door CREAKING open, however, causes her to look 
      up. Through a blurry haze she sees a disturbing sight--

      The STRANGER IN THE HOODIE standing in the doorway.

      Jessica opens her mouth, trying to yell for help. But now 
      heavily sedated, she can barely manage a whisper.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1244.

                    No... please...

      A GLOVED HAND slips over her mouth while another covers her 
      nose. Jessica s eyes go wide--

      As the Stranger smothers the life out of her.


      Slumped against the wall of the house, Lydia doesn t even 
      seem to notice the burned Peter Hale casually take a seat 
      next to her.

                                  PETER
                    I m sorry, Lydia. I realize this 
                    must be very confusing, but at 
                    least now you know you re not 
                    actually crazy. Well, not 
                      completely. There are bound to be 
                    some collateral effects, but you re 
                    a strong girl. Personally, I think 
                    you ll pull through with some 
                    minimal post traumatic stress and 
                    maybe a few years of profoundly 
                      disturbing nightmares.

      He pushes a dirty strand of hair back from her face. His 
      touch causes her to flinch as if shocked.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    I did have a plan, you know. It was 
                    a good plan. But if there s one 
                    thing I ve learned in life: Always 
                    have a backup.

      He comes closer to her ear, so close his lips are lightly 
      brushing her skin as he whispers to her.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    That would be you. Your immunity 
                    made you a perfect Plan B. You 
                    wouldn t turn from the bite. You 
                    wouldn t die. But you would be able 
                    to do one very important thing. Do 
                    you know what it is? Lydia?
                          (voice frighteningly 
                            demonic)
                    Lydia.

      She shudders and blinks as if snapped out of a trance.           TEEN WOLF "Episode 207"   GREEN2/22/1245.

      Now alone, Lydia looks down to see her hands clasped tightly 
      together. Slowly, she opens them to find the object she was 
      looking for...

      THE PURPLE WOLFSBANE FLOWER.

      Raising it to her eyes, she gazes on it now with familiarity 
      rather than confusion. With certainty. While just a few feet 
      away from her--

      Down underneath the floorboards of the house, surrounded by 
      earth and roots, the burned corpse of Peter Hale lies buried.  
      Like a sleeping giant...

      Patiently waiting to be awoken.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
