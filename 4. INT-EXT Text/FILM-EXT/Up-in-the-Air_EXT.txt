Ryan pulls up to one of the spaces marked with the #1 GOLD
PRESIDENTS CLUB emblem. He hops out and a uniformed man with a
handheld device begins to punch in the license plate number.
Ryan pulls out his HERTZ PRESIDENTS CLUB CARD and places it
nice and close to lens so we can see it.
The card slides through the handheld device and we see the
DIGITAL NUMBER increase by a few thousand points.
Their PLANE LANDS.
Sprinklers doing their job. One's broken.
Looking through the first floor window, we see Ryan doing
laps in the pool.
A CAR RETURN CLERK slides Ryan's card through a device.
Ryan steps up to an upscale building with little character,
searching for his keys at the bottom of his bag. Finally
finds them and opens the front door.
A downtown midsize high rise.
Natalie is standing with a camera in her hands, giving
directions.
NATALIE
Left, left, left, left... one more
inch... and stop.
Reveal: Ryan is placing the CUT-OUT of Julie and Jim.
The camera POV makes it look like Julie and Jim are standing
in front of St. Louis International Airport.
NATALIE
I don't get it.
RYAN
My sister is cooky. She thinks this is
charming... Like the gnome thing.
50.
NATALIE
No, I mean... why would your sister
want a fake photo in front of the
St. Louis Airport?
RYAN
She should be so lucky to visit Lambert
Field. The Wright Brothers flew through
there...
(points out the conical
MAIN TERMINAL)
The domed main terminal was the
first of its kind. A precursor to
everything from JFK to DeGualle.
NATALIE
(LAME)
Wow. Pretty sweet.
Natalie takes the photo.
RYAN
Why she wants dozens of reminders
of all the places she hasn't been
is beyond me.
NATALIE
Well, I'm sure she's going to be
crushed for having missed this airport.
RYAN
Look - Before Lindbergh could cross
the Atlantic, he took off from one of
those runways... Ever wondered why
they call it the Spirit of St. Louis?
NATALIE
(QUICKLY)
No.
Ryan goes to say something, but Natalie is already gone.
Natalie bursts out the doors and sits on a bench. She's
freaked out. Ryan is five steps behind her. He puts a hand on
her shoulder.
RYAN
People say these things all the
time. It comes with the trade.
NATALIE
They do?
RYAN
Sure. People are always saying
crazy stuff. They get worked up.
NATALIE
She was so calm.
53.
RYAN
(not quite sure)
I think that's a good sign.
NATALIE
So they don't actually ever do it?
RYAN
No... it's just talk.
NATALIE
How do you know? Do you follow up?
RYAN
I mean, no, nothing good can come
of that, but I don't think you
should worry about it.
Natalie is clearly still worried.
RYAN (CONT'D)
This is the job. Taking people at
their most fragile moment and
setting them adrift.
BEGIN MONTAGE
A PLANE PULLING BACK ITS GATE AND TAKING OFF
WHITE COLLAR PEOPLE ARE HANDED PACKETS
RYAN AND ALEX ENTERING A NEW HOTEL ROOM. THEY'RE BECOMING
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER
A 757 touches down on the runway.
MUSIC BEGINS TO FADE AS THE MONTAGE COMES TO A CLOSE ON...
RYAN'S HEADSHOT - sitting on an EASLE.
AN AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANE touches down.
We're following a HILTON SHUTTLE down a street of PALM TREES.
A nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before
the bubble popped. Inside the galley, a group is playing
karaoke. NATALIE, wearing BADGES like Mardi Gras beads, is
singing "Time After Time".
Meanwhile, near the back, Ryan and Alex sit with their legs
hanging off the back of the hull.
ALEX
Back home, I don't get to act the way
I do with you.
RYAN
That's why I don't have a "back home".
ALEX
I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty
Back Pack".
Ryan emotionally stumbles.
RYAN
You know about the back pack?
ALEX
I googled you.
RYAN
You did?
66.
ALEX
It's what us modern girls do when
we have a crush.
RYAN
Did it bother you?
ALEX
Well, that depends. Is the bag
empty because you hate people or
just the baggage they bring along?
RYAN
I don't hate people. I'm not
exactly a hermit.
ALEX
You just don't want to be tied down?
The whole responsibility thing.
RYAN
I don't think it's even that...
I... First time I ever flew, I was
sixteen.
ALEX
You're not going to answer? You're
just going to tell me a story?
RYAN
(smiles, continues story)
It was January and I had just
gotten my driver's license. The
lakes were frozen over, so we piled
into my car and hit the ice to do
donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit
a soft spot and the hood of my car
tilted up and I was sinking
backwards into the water.
ALEX
Jesus...
RYAN
I literally started to drown.
Within a few seconds, I black out.
Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a
helicopter, laying on a stretcher.
This guy in a uniform is telling me I
was minutes away from dying.
ALEX
Oh my God.
67.
RYAN
Right?
(relives it for a second)
So just as we're hovering over the
hospital, I sit up. And from there,
I could see the whole western
horizon. We'd been flying twenty
minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a
city I'd thought of as remote,
halfway across the state... a
foreign capital.
(A BEAT)
My parents had taught me we lived
in the best place on Earth, but now
I could see the world was really
just one place and comparing didn't
make much sense. And I remember
thinking - Don't tell me this isn't
an age of miracles. Don't tell me
we can't be everywhere at once.
The idea settles in. Ryan returns to the point.
RYAN
I don't know what originally
sparked the back pack. I probably
needed to be alone. Recently, I've
been thinking that maybe I needed
to empty the bag before I knew what
to put back in.
And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous
kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people
kiss in the first place.
Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The
motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the
software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.
SOFTWARE DUDE
Hey... I think we're out of gas.
Ryan and Alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. For
whatever reason, they just start cracking up.
Ryan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of
the rubber boat as it putters its way to shore.
Cold, soaked, and smiling.
Natalie and David are there too... still kissing.
68.
Everyone gets out of the boat in the cold knee deep water and
splashes up to shore.
Ryan's eyes flutter awake to see Alex getting dressed.
RYAN
Hey, you're up...
ALEX
Got to fly stand-by and make a
meeting in Milwaukee.
RYAN
(DISAPPOINTED)
Oh... Okay.
ALEX
(notices, teasing)
Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.
RYAN
Yeah, all right... Just leave the
money on the dresser.
ALEX
(SWEETLY)
I'll text you later so we can swap
schedules.
Alex gives him a peck. Ryan takes her wrist so she can't leave.
RYAN
I can't remember the last time I
enjoyed spending time with someone
as much as you.
ALEX
Neither can I.
They kiss again and he lets go. Alex leaves and the door
closes. Ryan just lays in bed for a moment.
69.
The walkway overlooks a large MARINA filled with giant
YACHTS. Ryan and Natalie are doing the photo thing with the
CUT OUT of the engagement portrait again.
70.
NATALIE
What happened to Alex?
RYAN
Had to skip town early to make a
meeting.
NATALIE
That's too bad. Where does she live?
RYAN
Chicago.
NATALIE
You thinking of going to see her?
RYAN
I don't know. We just don't have
that kind of relationship.
NATALIE
What kind of relationship do you
have?
RYAN
It's, you know. Casual.
NATALIE
Sounds pretty special.
RYAN
It works for us.
NATALIE
Think there's any future there?
RYAN
Never thought about it. What's
going on here?
NATALIE
Really never thought about it?
RYAN
(a good lie)
No.
NATALIE
How can you not think about these
things? How does it not even cross
your mind that you might want to
have a future with somebody?
71.
RYAN
It's simple, you know that moment
when you look into someone's eyes
and you feel them looking right
into your soul, and the whole world
goes quiet for a second.
NATALIE
(finally, a break through)
Yes.
RYAN
Right. Well, I don't.
NATALIE
You're an asshole.
Natalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up.
RYAN
Oh come on, I'm just dicking
around. I need your help...
NATALIE
Don't you think it's worth giving
her a chance?
RYAN
A chance to what?
NATALIE
A chance at something real?
RYAN
Natalie, your definition of "real"
is going to evolve as you get
older...
NATALIE
Would you stop condescending for
one second? Or is that one of the
principles of your bullshit
philosophy?
RYAN
Bullshit philosophy?
NATALIE
The isolation? The traveling? Is
that supposed to be charming?
RYAN
No, it's simply a life choice.
72.
NATALIE
It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
RYAN
Wow. Big words.
NATALIE
Screw you.
RYAN
Well, screw you too.
NATALIE
You've set up a way of life that
basically makes it impossible for
you to make any human connections.
Now, somehow, this woman runs the
gauntlet of your ridiculous "life
choice" and comes out the other end
with a smile - Just so you can call
her casual. Jesus. I need to grow
up? You're a twelve year old.
Natalie begins walking away.
RYAN
I don't have a gauntlet of...
A GUST OF WIND suddenly blows the CUTOUT across the boardwalk
into the OCEAN.
RYAN
... Fuck!
Ryan goes running after the cutout. He climbs down a GANGWAY
to a dock that is closest to the CUTOUT, which is beginning
to sink in the filthy water.
Ryan reaches... and reaches... and just as he's got a finger
tip on the photo... FALLS IN.
We're watching Ryan through the window of the plane. He
almost looks trapped.
The plane lands amidst snow.
A one story brick building. There's an inch of snow on the
ground. Ryan and Natalie enter the building in silence.
We find Natalie standing next to the rental car. She's staring
into a snow drift. Her eyes say everything - She just grew up.
Meanwhile, Ryan is on his CELL. We catch the end of his
conversation with Craig.
RYAN (CONT'D)
... We just got out here. That was
one place. I think we need to try a
few more...
(LISTENS)
Maybe there isn't a difference, but
it's comforting to know we're in
the next room.
(LISTENING)
I know you don't give a shit about
my comfort.
(LISTENS)
We could just use a little more
time. That's all I'm saying.
(LISTENS)
Right... Right.
(shakes his head)
Yeah... Alright... Uh huh. Bye.
Ryan hangs up.
RYAN (CONT'D)
He thought you did a great job. You
did - I was real proud of you.
NATALIE
Thanks.
RYAN
We're being pulled off the road.
(CLARIFYING)
We're going home.
NATALIE
For good?
RYAN
That's what it looks like.
A moment of mixed emotions.
We're looking at the LUXOR PYRAMID.
RYAN (O.C.)
Okay, start walking it in from the left.
ALEX enters frame, carrying the engagement CUT OUT.
ALEX
I have to admit, when you asked me to
meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd
gamble, make out in a heart shaped
jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird
French Canadian circus shows.
RYAN
There'll be plenty of time for all that.
(directing the photo)
One more foot to the left.
Alex obliges. She checks out the engagement photo.
ALEX
How do you feel about the wedding?
RYAN
I'm fine, I guess.
(directing the photo)
Okay great... walk away.
Ryan takes the photo.
Alex picks up the engagement photo.
ALEX
They're a cute couple.
RYAN
Think so?
ALEX
Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're
lucky, maybe look a little like you.
Alex and Ryan look at the photo together for a second.
RYAN
How do you like Wisconsin in February?
ALEX
Who doesn't?
(SWEETLY)
(MORE)
81.
ALEX (CONT'D)
I like it if you're there. Besides, I
know a killer burger in Milwaukee.
RYAN
Northern Wisconsin.
(CLARIFYING)
What are you doing this weekend?
This quickly registers... He's inviting me to the wedding.
ALEX (CONT'D)
No...
RYAN
What? I haven't even...
ALEX
I can't.
RYAN
Why not?
ALEX
I couldn't.
RYAN
I'm being serious.
ALEX
You want me to be your date?
RYAN
Well... Yeah.
ALEX
To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your
sister's wedding?
RYAN
It's not like I know her that well.
ALEX
I'm just not sure if it's
appropriate for me to...
RYAN
Look. You know. I'm not the wedding
type. But for the first time in my
life... I don't want to be that
guy, alone with his drink. I want a
dancing partner. I want a plus one.
And if you can stomach it, I'd like
it to be you.
82.
A long thoughtful beat. Alex sighs.
ALEX
Okay.
RYAN
Really?
ALEX
Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah,
I'm in. When is it?
RYAN
I feel like we should kiss or
something.
ALEX
Then kiss me.
They do.
Ryan's rental car pulls into the CHALET SUITES driveway. It's
halfway between a Swiss Lodge and a Best Western. Just a
little sadder. A yellow sign reads "Welcome Miller-Bingham
Wedding Guests!"
Everyone is leaving. Tammy grabs Julie's hands.
TAMMY
Can you believe it's tomorrow?! How
are you going to sleep?
JULIE
I don't know!
TAMMY
You want some Xanax?
RYAN
I don't think that's for sleeping.
JULIE
No, I'm good. I'll have some warm
milk. That should do the trick.
Jim comes walking by with a box of flower arrangements from
the tables inside that are going to be reused at the wedding.
JIM
One more box...
89.
ALEX
I'll get it.
RYAN
You sure?
ALEX
Yeah, yeah...
Alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how
many years, Ryan, Kara, and Julie are alone together.
RYAN
Jim seems like a good guy.
JULIE
Yeah, I know... Isn't he great?
KARA
He's going to make a great husband.
There's a moment where they just look at each other and
giggle a little. Just the three of them.
RYAN
Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with
dad not being... Well, I didn't
know if you had someone to walk you
down the aisle...
JULIE
Oh, yeah, Jim's uncle is going to
do it.
KARA
(UNCOMFORTABLE)
He's been really supportive.
RYAN
Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to
make sure you were covered. So I
should get there at...
JULIE
Guests are arriving around 5ish.
Things get going at 530. So you
know, around then. It's easy. Just
come down the elevator.
Alex comes out with the second box. Ryan notices and grabs the
flowers from her and sets them in Jim's luxury pick-up truck.
90.
The rental car pulls up into the empty lot. Snow on the
ground. It's cold.
Ryan and Alex walk up the steps and try the door of the main
building - it's locked. Ryan shrugs.
ALEX
That's all you got?
Alex starts walking down the side of the building, looking
for an open window. The third one opens a crack. She slides
her HOTEL HONORS CARD in and opens the latch.
RYAN
Are we really doing this?
ALEX
Give me a boost.
91.
Ryan and Alex are huddled at the trophy case.
ALEX
You played basketball?
RYAN
Point guard. Don't act so surprised.
ALEX
I didn't know you were such a jock.
Ryan and Alex walk passed a concrete ledge.
RYAN
My first fight.
92.
ALEX
How'd it go?
RYAN
Got my ass kicked.
Alex and Ryan sit tight like teenagers on the team bench.
ALEX
I'm really happy I came here.
The school soccer team takes the field for practice.
RYAN
(to the team)
Go Cougars!
Players look back at him strangely.
Ryan's phone rings.
RYAN
(checks caller ID)
It's Kara.
The first thing we hear is crying in the background.
INTERCUT WITH:
Ryan's rental car pulls up in front. He hops out and Alex
takes the driver's seat.
ALEX
I'll grab your suit.
(ADDING)
Good luck.
One of the GIANT DIGITAL MARQUEES reads: "GOALQUEST XX"
Ryan hustles past SLOT MACHINES until he is actually jogging.
Ryan hurriedly signs a hand-held device, hops into a SEDAN
and speeds off. The RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT suddenly realizes...
RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT
Hey, you forgot to give me your
Devotion Club card!
Ryan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of
the townhouse - checking the address against a piece of
HILTON STATIONARY.
Ryan stops, knocks, and puts on a smile.
We hear Footsteps. The door unlocks and opens revealing ALEX.
She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She
looks different.
RYAN
Surprise.
But there's something else. Alex is in shock... She's frozen.
Something's wrong. Ryan's smile begins to melt.
A man's voice calls from inside.
MAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
Honey, who's at the door?
A couple kids run by through the background, giggling. A man
chases after them.
Alex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing
all at the same time.
Ryan just stands there. Emotionally bleeding to death.
ALEX
(ALMOST INAUDIBLE)
What are you doing here?
Ryan begins to step away. He turns and heads for his car,
dropping the flowers.
Alex's husband becomes visible just as she's shutting the door.
ALEX'S HUSBAND
Who was that?
104.
ALEX
... just some guy who was lost.
Ryan gets in his rental car and drives off.
We're watching Ryan through his window from far away... almost
as if looking through binoculars. He sits on his bed, tie
undone, holding a glass with an inch of scotch on his knee.
Ryan is on the phone with Alex.
RYAN
How could you lie to me?
INTERCUT WITH:
Ryan is walking when his phone buzzes. He checks the DISPLAY -
CTC Calling. He presses IGNORE.
Ryan picks up the phone at his desk. He removes his new TEN
MILLION MILE CARD and dials a number off the back.
AIRLINE OPERATOR
Hello, Mr. Bingham.
108.
RYAN
Oh, how did you know it was me?
AIRLINE OPERATOR
This is your dedicated line. We
reserve them for our most loyal and
dedicated fliers.
RYAN
Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my
miles. Can you open up an account
under Jim and Julie Miller?
AIRLINE OPERATOR
Certainly. How many miles would you
like to transfer?
RYAN
How many miles would it take to
circle the globe?
AIRPORT OPERATOR
We have our "around-the-world" tickets.
They're five hundred thousand miles each.
RYAN
Sounds perfect.
Craig enters Ryan's doorway.
CRAIG GREGORY
Got a second?
RYAN
(to the airline operator)
I'm going to have to call you right back.
Craig takes a seat across from Ryan.
CRAIG GREGORY
What happened to you yesterday? I
was trying to reach you all day.
RYAN
I got tied up in... personal stuff.
What's going on?
An uncomfortable beat.
CRAIG GREGORY
Do you remember Karen Barnes?
Ryan doesn't.
109.
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
She was part of a thirty person
reduction a few weeks back in
Wichita. Natalie fired her.
RYAN
No, I fire dozens of people a day.
CRAIG GREGORY
She killed herself. Jumped off a bridge.
RYAN
Fuck.
CRAIG GREGORY
(AGREES)
Yeah.
(FORMALITY)
Do you remember anyone giving you any
signals of anything? Depression?
RYAN
They're all depressed. We're firing them.
CRAIG GREGORY
Hey, look, you know I have to ask.
RYAN
No, I don't remember anything. Of
course they're upset. You never
think that...
CRAIG GREGORY
Wasn't any woman who gave you any
indication...? Anything?
Ryan remembers her.
RYAN
No, nothing that stands out.
(A THOUGHT)
Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in?
CRAIG GREGORY
Natalie quit.
Ryan isn't surprised.
RYAN
Just like that?
CRAIG GREGORY
Text message.
110.
Ryan stifles a laugh.
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
Yeah, real fucking nice, right? No
one has manners anymore.
RYAN
She say where she was going?
CRAIG GREGORY
Nah. She was pretty upset.
RYAN
I should give her a call.
CRAIG GREGORY
(BUSINESS)
I need you back in the air.
Ryan doesn't react.
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
Did you hear me? I thought you'd be
thrilled.
RYAN
I'm fine. What about video conferencing?
CRAIG GREGORY
CTC is pausing on the whole new media
front for a moment. Giving it a little
more thought. Getting our work horses
back out doing what they do best.
RYAN
How long are you sending me out?
CRAIG GREGORY
We're going to let you sail and
sail. Send us a postcard if you
ever get there.
Ryan absorbs this. Nods.
