It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD-
LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins,
squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill.
She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one
hand.
The main floor kitchen, like most
things in the Pink
Palace, is barely maintained, and
looks worn and faded.
Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,
bangs away at her
laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES
stacked nearby. She's
plain-looking and tired and wears
a NECK-BRACE.
CORALINE
I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.
MEL
(not listening)
Uh huh.
CORALINE
I would have died.
MEL
(continues typing)
That's nice.
Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject.
CORALINE
Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's
perfect weather for gardening.
MEL
No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a
mess.
Coraline turns to her.
CORALINE
But Mom, I want stuff growing when my
friends come to visit. Isn't that why we
moved here?
MEL
Something like that. But then we had the
accident.
CORALINE
Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
MEL
I never said it was.
CORALINE
(MUTTERS)
I can't believe it -- you and Dad get
paid to write about plants and you hate
dirt.
Mel stops typing, loses her patience.
MEL
Coraline, I don't have time for you right
now. And you still have unpacking to do.
Lots of unpacking.
CORALINE
That sounds exciting.
Mel remembers something.
Mel (CONT'D)
Oh - some kid left this on the front
porch.
Coraline walks over and is handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED
PACKAGE. Attached note reads:
WYBIE (V.O.)
Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's
trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.
She rips open the package and finds the BUTTON-EYED, BLUE-
HAIRED, YELLOW RAINCOAT-WEARING DOLL from the head
credits - it's a litte Coraline!
CORALINE
(to herself)
Huh... a little me? That's weird.
She crumples the note, both annoyed and charmed.
MEL
What's his name, anyway?
CORALINE
Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.
But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room.
CHARLIE Jones, 40, goose-necked and gangly with thinning
dark hair, HUNT-AND-PECKS at his ancient computer,
surrounded by boxes of GARDENING MAGAZINES and empty
coffee cups. Coraline, with doll, opens the SQUEAKY DOOR.
He doesn't turn.
CORALINE
Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?
He ignores her reflection in his computer screen as he
types away, green letters on black. She CLEARS HER
THROAT.
CHARLIE
Hello, Coraline...
(notices doll's reflection)
And... Coraline doll?...
CORALINE
D'you know where the garden tools are?
He hears rain outside.
CHARLIE
It's pouring out there, isn't it.
CORALINE
Humph, it's just raining.
CHARLIE
What'd the boss say?
CORALINE
(MOCKING)
"Don't even think about going out,
Coraline Jones."
CHARLIE
Then you won't need the tools.
Coraline GROANS, stamps her feet. Charlie just taps
harder on the keys. Pouting, she makes the door squeak,
opening and shutting it till he can't take any more. He
spins around.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred
and fifty years old.
CORALINE
So?
CHARLIE
So explore it!
He grabs a pen and pad, holds it out.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Go out and ... count all the doors and
windows and write that down. List
everything blue!
(BEGGING)
Just let me work.
She rolls her eyes, takes paper and pen and leaves.
MONTAGE, VARIOUS - SAME
HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS
Coraline, with doll, jumps on BUMP in carpet that moves
with each jump.
LAUNDRY ROOM/WINTER GARDEN
She wipes off the misted glass so she and the doll can
see out, then writes in her pad: 7 leaky windows. A drop
of water lands on the pad, smearing the ink. She adds
really between 7 and leaky windows.
HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS
Coraline thumps the carpet bump again and pounds up the
stairs.
PARENT'S ROOM/BATHROOM
A FRAMED PHOTO sits in the foreground on a beside table.
It shows a younger, happier Coraline with her parents by
the BEAR FOUNTAIN at the Detroit Zoo. RACK FOCUS to
bedroom door as it swings into the room, with Coraline
hanging on it. She drops to the ground and, doll and pad
in hand, decides to check out the bathroom.
When she pulls aside the mildewed shower curtain she
finds a hundred skittering SILVERFISH BUGS.
CORALINE
Ewww!
Disgusted, she jumps into the tub and smashes as many as
she can.
She turns on the faucet to wash her hands, only to get
soaked with rusty water from the shower head.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Ahh!!
She shakes out her hair.
HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS
Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump
again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door
opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate.
WATER HEATER CLOSET
ANGLE OVER water heater on Coraline. She jots down one
rusty water heater in her pad. As she leaves, she flicks
off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it
that says: Do not turn off!
Lights flicker and then Charlie's computer dies. He
hollers.
CHARLIE
No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--!
CHARLIE (O.S.)
--AAAAAAA!
Coraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the
closet and --
-- spots the Do not turn off note. She flips the light
switch back on and gets out of there.
The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out
on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes,
a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A
few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard
mattress box leans against a corner wall.
Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in
her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open
moving box and smiles.
The box is filled with her mom's collection of
SNOWGLOBES. She takes out her favorite - the BEAR
FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT ZOO - and shakes it. She studies
the globe and sighs with homesickness. She sets it
carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL, then unwraps the rest
of the snowglobes and places them beside it.
Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE -
a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand
holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and
adds to her list, muttering aloud.
CORALINE
One boring blue boy in a painfully boring
painting ... four incredibly boring
windows ... and no... more... doors...
She turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow
globe box. It's gone.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
All right, little me, where are you
hiding?
Scanning the room, she spots the doll LOOKING OUT FROM
BEHIND THE MATTRESS BOX leaned against the corner wall.
Perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the
doll when she notices SOMETHING ON THE WALL behind the
box.
She shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a
SMALL DOOR that's been wallpapered over.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Huh?
Intensely curious, she calls to the kitchen.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Hey Mom...
Mom, typing away, ignores her.
CORALINE (O.S.)
Where does this door go?
MEL
I'm really, really busy!
INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Coraline tries to open it but there's no handle.
CORALINE
I think it's locked.
MEL (O.S.)
CORALINE (O.S.)
Pleeeeeeeeease!
Mel gets up, really annoyed. Big sigh.
MEL
Uhhh...
She walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the
door in the ratty old wallpaper.
MEL
Will you stop pestering me if I do this
for you?
Coraline nods her head quickly, PANTING like a dog.
MEL (CONT'D)
Fine.
She heads back to the kitchen.
INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Mel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass
and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key.
Holds it up.
INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key
in the lock. Coraline looks on, giddy with anticipation,
the doll at her side. Mel turns the key, unlocks the
door, and pulls it open to reveal ... an UNBROKEN BRICK
WALL. Coraline is totally disappointed.
CORALINE
Bricks? I don't get it.
Coraline scratches her wrist rash with annoyance.
MEL
They must have closed this off when they
divided up the house.
Mel gets up to leave.
CORALINE
You're kidding? And why is the door so
small?
Mel leaving room, turns back, and loses it.
MEL
We made a deal. ZIP IT!
She exits. Coraline makes annoyed sound.
CORALINE
You didn't lock it.
MEL (O.S.)
AaaaaH!!!
Coraline pushes the little door shut, her head lowered.
CHARLIE, using OVEN MITT to protect his hand, takes a
BURNED-UP CASSEROLE DISH from the oven while mom closes
up her LAPTOP. Coraline sits at the table with her doll.
CHARLIE
I think you are so nice,
I give you bowls of porridge
And I give you bowls of ice --
CHARLIE sets the dish on the table.
CHARLIE
(really bad note)
-- cream!
Coraline pushes it away, disgusted.
CORALINE
Why don't you ever cook, Mom?
MEL
Coraline, we've been through this before:
your Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out
of the way.
Coraline HUFFS.
MEL (CONT'D)
I swear I'll go food shopping soon as we
finish the catalog.
(indicates Coraline's plate)
Try some of the chard, you need a
vegetable.
CORALINE
Looks more like slime to me.
CHARLIE
Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot --
now what's it going to be?
Coraline looks to her doll, cradles its head.
CORALINE
Think they're trying to poison me?
She makes the doll's head nod "yes." Coraline rolls her
eyes, looks up to the heavens and --
-- falls back, washed and dressed for bed, on her pillow.
Still raining out. Coraline puts the doll on the chair
beside her, then scratches at her wrist. ORIGAMI
DRAGONFLIES are strung between the tall, thin bed posts;
the TURTLE SHELL she found in the garden sits up on a
box, her NIGHT LAMP that projects stars and moons is
warming up on the bedside table. Despite her efforts at
decorating, Coraline's new bedroom feels small and cold,
cracked and faded.
Coraline reaches for a framed PHOTO that rests on a toy
PRAYING MANTIS by her night lamp.
It's her TWO BEST FRIENDS from home, posing in the snow
by her old school's marquee, its letters rearranged to
spell "CORALINE, GOOD BYE!" She touches her friends'
faces with her fingertips.
CORALINE
Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?
She puts back the photo, hits the light switch over her
bed and, looking over at the doll, sighs.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Good-night...little me.
Her breathing slows and, with the doll WATCHING HER, she
starts to fall asleep.
--SURREAL MIST SWIRLS out her window. MOONS AND STARS
SLOWLY MOVE across the walls.
SOMETHING in the room goes t-t-t-t-t-t. Coraline sits up,
awake. SOMETHING CHITTERS under her bed. She leans over
her bedside, head first, peering underneath when a ghost-
pale KANGAROO MOUSE JUMPS OUT and bounds out the door.
She gives chase, down the upper hall, down the stairs,
snaps on the lower hall light, sees it hop into the
living room.
Coraline enters. The mouse edges out from beneath the
sofa, then hops frantically toward the SMALL DOOR behind
the wallpaper! Coraline runs and dives, but the door is
open a crack, and the mouse escapes.
Coraline grabs the door's edge and pulls it open. Instead
of a brick wall, there is a DARK, EXPANDING TUNNEL, with
the hopping mouse heading towards a bluish light at the
far end.
CORALINE
Whoa...
She catches her breath, pulls the door wider and CRAWLS
THROUGH.
Coraline MOVES FORWARD, towards the light ahead.
Coraline steps out through the same little door, into
what looks like the EXACT SAME LIVING ROOM she just left,
only something is different -- it feels deeper, more
dimensional.
CORALINE
Huh?
She looks around, notices the painting over the
fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt
clean and his ice cream back on his cone.
From across the hall, warm light comes from the kitchen
and the smell of delicious food wafts towards her nose.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
MMMMM, something smells good.
Coraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove,
wearing an apron and ROOSTER-HEAD OVEN MITTS. The light
and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect
in this kitchen. Other Mother is facing away from
Coraline as she works.
CORALINE
Mom?! What are you doing here in the
middle of the night?
Her mother turns from the stove to greet her and Coraline
is DUMBSTRUCK: she's got BUTTONS FOR EYES! She beams with
happiness at Coraline's arrival.
OTHER MOTHER
You're just in time for supper, dear!
CORALINE
You're not my mother.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
My mother doesn't have b-b-buh...
Coraline points to her own eye.
OTHER MOTHER
B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them?
She taps one with her nail.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
I'm your Other Mother, silly. Now go tell
your Other Father that supper's ready.
She opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of
great cooking fills the air. Coraline breathes it in,
suddenly VERY HUNGRY.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
Well, go on. He's in his study.
Coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door.
She sees the back of a man like her father, only with
more hair. Instead of tapping away at his computer,
though, he's picking notes on a BABY GRAND PIANO.
CORALINE
Hello?
He turns around. He, too, has SHINY BUTTON EYES. He seems
happier and a little more handsome than real Dad, and
wears an IRIDESCENT ROBE over POLKA DOT PAJAMAS, with
ORANGE MONKEY SLIPPERS on his feet. He smiles broadly.
OTHER FATHER
Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new
song?
CORALINE
My father can't play piano.
OTHER FATHER
No need to ... this piano plays ME!
DR. SEUSS GLOVES  connected with rods and pulleys  POP
OUT of the piano's front and ONTO HIS HANDS. His hands
RAISE UP  then DROP DOWN to play pounding STRIDE PIANO
as Other Father SINGS out.
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
Making up a song about Coraline.
She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal
of mine.
She's as cute as a button in the eyes of
everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor-
a-line.
Coraline is amazed as his hands fly.
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
When she comes around exploring
Mom and I will never ever make it boring
our eyes will be on Coraline.
Anxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him.
CORALINE
I, uh  sorry  but she said to tell you
the food's ready.
OTHER FATHER
Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand.
He sticks his hand up, still in a glove, and his other
gloved hand slaps his face. She LAUGHS, then covers her
mouth.
Other Mother sets down a HUGE, ROASTED CHICKEN near
Coraline on a table spread with CANDLES, fine CHINA and
SILVER and a PINEAPPLE CENTERPIECE. FIGURE EIGHT MODEL
TRAIN TRACKS circle twin LAZY SUSANS covered in dishes of
POTATOES, SWEET PEAS, ROLLS, and CORN. The Other Father
seals this Norman Rockwell moment by making PRAYER HANDS
and a solemn face.
OTHER FATHER
We give our thanks and ask to bless,
Our Mother's golden chicken breast!
He laughs with glee then a STARTING BELL rings and it's
time to eat. Other Father really digs in while Coraline
tries some chicken.
CORALINE
Mmmm, this chicken is good.
OTHER MOTHER
Hungry, aren't you.
CORALINE
(nodding, mouth full)
D'you have any gravy?
OTHER MOTHER
Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo-
choo!
Other Mother GIGGLES as a MODEL TRAIN circles round the
track, pulling a GRAVY BOAT CAR and blowing its whistle.
The train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes
out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with
Coraline's plate, where it POURS GRAVY on her potatoes.
OTHER MOTHER
Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the
cob?
Other Mother looks on approvingly, not touching any food
herself.
CORALINE
(mouth full)
I'm real thirsty.
OTHER MOTHER
Of course! Any requests?
A beautiful CHANDELIER DRINK DISPENSER descends.
CORALINE
Mango milk shake?
The dispenser SPINS, stops and fills her glass while
Other Mother presents dessert: a cake with candles that
POP UP and LIGHT THEMSELVES while the words "WELCOME
HOME!" write themselves in icing. Coraline is taken
aback.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Home?
Her Other Parents squeeze each other's hands warmly.
OTHER MOTHER
We've been waiting for you, Coraline.
CORALINE
For me?
OTHER FATHER
Yep. Wasn't the same here without you,
kiddo.
Coraline remains a little unsure.
CORALINE
I didn't know I had an Other Mother.
OTHER MOTHER
Of course you do. Everyone does.
She smiles at Coraline, her button eyes gleaming.
CORALINE
Really?
OTHER MOTHER
Uh huh, and soon as you're through
eating, I thought we'd play a game.
She taps her fingers a little too excitedly on the table.
CORALINE
(SKEPTICAL)
You mean like, hide and seek?
OTHER MOTHER
Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain.
CORALINE
What rain?
THUNDER, LIGHTNING, then RAIN appears outside the window.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Huh, what about the mud?
OTHER FATHER
We love mud here!
Other Mother rises, walks towards Coraline.
OTHER MOTHER
Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's
great for poison oak.
The takes Coraline's rashy hand, but Coraline pulls it
away.
CORALINE
(SUSPICIOUS)
How'd you know I--
Coraline adjusts her tone.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get
home to my other mother.
OTHER MOTHER
But I'm your other mother.
CORALINE
(BEFUDDLED)
I mean my other other mother. Mom number
one?
(YAWNS)
I think I should get to bed.
OTHER MOTHER
Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up.
CORALINE
(shakes head)
But ...
Other Father steps in beside her.
OTHER FATHER
Come along, sleepyhead.
They lead her from the table towards the stairs to her
bedroom.
In this world, Coraline's bedroom is a dream come true:
it is filled with rich color and light; there's a fire in
the fireplace, a sheer, lacy canopy over her now
beautiful bed. And her favorite toys are alive!
CORALINE
Wow.
Her ORIGAMI DRAGONFLIES FLUTTER towards her.
DRAGONFLIES
Hello Coraline, hello, hello!
Her BLUE SQUID greets her with a WAVE of its tentacle.
TOY SQUID
What's shakin', baby?
CORALINE
Hello.
The TURTLE SHELL she'd found CIRCLES HER FEET on clothes
pin legs, making PANTING SOUNDS. She laughs, then hears
two voices from beside her bed.
PHOTO FRIEND 1 (O.C.)
(MICHIGAN-SPEAK)
Hey, how zit goin', yuper!
PHOTO FRIEND 2 (O.C.)
(MICHIGAN-SPEAK)
Where's your swampers and tuke?
She jumps onto the bed, grabs the photo of her best
friends from home, now ALIVE IN THE PHOTO.
CORALINE
Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls?
I can't wait till summer. You're both
comin', right?
PHOTO FRIEND 1
We're already here, Coraline --
PHOTO FRIEND 2
-- gone to Or-e-gine!
Coraline grins hugely, then, exhausted, she yawns,
stretching out her arms.
The Other Mother, in the bedside chair, takes her hand
and applies some SOOTHING BLACK MUD to Coraline's poison
oak rash.
CORALINE
Oh, the mud...
The Other Mother gently tucks her in then she and the
Other Father smile at Coraline as she drifts off to
sleep.
OTHER MOTHER
OTHER FATHER
See you soon ...
See you soon ...
PULL BACK MATCH
DISSOLVE:
Coraline awakens. She looks around expecting bright
colors, a magic dragonfly. But it's just her NORMAL ROOM:
moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed.
She notices the BUTTON-EYED DOLL on the chair where she
left it, where the Other Mother was sitting. She picks it
up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist. She stops,
noticing that the rash on her wrist IS GONE.
CORALINE
(GASPING)
It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!...
Coraline goes to the little door, still ajar. She peeks
behind and finds the WALL OF SOLID BRICKS. Yes, it was
only a dream.
CORALINE
(SOFTLY)
Huh?
She shakes her head and pushes the door shut. The kettle
blows from the kitchen.
KITCHEN - DAY, GROUND FOG OUT WINDOWS
Breakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean
Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied
with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts
her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the
windows.
CORALINE
It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you
weren't really you; you were my other
mother.
MEL
(DISAPPROVING)
Buttons for eyes, huh?
(indicates untouched food)
Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all
that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at
least.
CORALINE
You were in the dream too, Dad. You had
wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey
slippers.
CHARLIE
(pretend offense)
Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.
He stands, put his dishes in the sink. Whispers over his
SHOULDER:
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
(OPTIONAL)
Pssst. Can you get me some of that magic
mud you were talking about?
She points to her rash-free wrists. He nods.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Because I have a terrible case of
writer's rash. On my---.
Mel CLEARS HER THROAT, interrupting.
MEL
If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages
edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP.
He crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches
out the door. Mel gets up to clear the table with
Coraline.
MEL (CONT'D)
Coraline, why don't you go visit
downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would
love to hear your dream.
CORALINE
Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said
they're dingbats.
MEL
(NODS)
Uh huh.
Coraline sighs, gets up to go.
Miss Spink leads Coraline into the living area, as MISS
FORCIBLE, taller and sporting a platinum wig and a very
large bosom, prepares tea in the kitchen to the side. The
dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa. Coraline scans
the walls to see framed POSTERS from the "Shakespeare"
the ladies used to perform like King Leer and Julius
Seize Her. Miss Forcible peers out her, half-blind
without her glasses.
MISS FORCIBLE
April, I think you're being followed.
MISS SPINK
It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline?
She'll be having the Oolong tea.
MISS FORCIBLE
No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer
Jasmine.
MISS SPINK
No, Oolong.
MISS FORCIBLE
Ah, Jasmine it is, then.
Forcible grabs a handful of tea, puts it in the pot and
pours boiling water in.
MISS SPINK
Come on, boys!
The dogs leap off the sofa and, as Coraline takes their
place, she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase
filled with STUFFED SCOTTY DOGS IN KNITTED SWEATERS WITH
ANGEL WINGS.
CORALINE
(ALARMED)
Are those dogs .... real?
MISS SPINK
(SIGHS)
Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn't bear
to part with them ... so we had them
stuffed.
(CONTINUES)
(MORE)
MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
Now, there's Hamish the third, the
fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the
second, the fifth, the..
Miss Forcible arrives with a tea tray and urges Coraline
to take a candy as Spink goes on and on.
MISS FORCIBLE
Oh go on, have one  it's hand-pulled
taffy from Brighton  best in the world.
Coraline reaches for a pink and green one. But the taffy
is so old and sticky, her fingers get stuck. Then her
other hand gets stuck, trying to get the first hand out.
MISS SPINK (O.C.)
...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes,
the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior,
Jock senior, Jock the third, the
fourth...
Coraline, using her feet, finally un-sticks the candy
bowl which FLIES UP and sticks to the ceiling.
MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin,
twice removed.
She turns to Coraline, about to sip her tea. Spink
indicates cup.
MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
I'll read them, if you like.
CORALINE
Read what?
MISS SPINK
Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They'll tell
me your future. Drink up then, go on.
Coraline gulps down the bitter brew.
MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
No, not all of it, not all of it. That's
right, now hand it over.
Coraline passes her the cup. Spink puts a saucer on top
and swirls it three times, removes the saucer and peers
in at the abstract leaf pattern. She purses her lips.
MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
Oh... Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you
are in terrible danger.
Miss Forcible snorts.
MISS FORCIBLE
Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes
are going.
MISS SPINK
My eyes! You're blind as a bat!
Spink passes the cup to Forcible, who adjusts thick
glasses and peers closely into it.
MISS FORCIBLE
Oh, now, ummm... not to worry, child,
it's good news: there's a tall, handsome
beast in your future.
CORALINE
A what?
MISS SPINK
Miriam, oh really, you're holding it
wrong.
Spink forcibly rotates the cup.
MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
See? Danger!
Coraline wants more information.
CORALINE
What do you see?
The ladies, heads side by side, gaze into the cup. We see
a SPIKY CLAW formed from the leaves.
MISS SPINK
(OMINOUS)
I see a very peculiar hand...
Forcible rotates the cup back again. Upside down, the
claw hand looks like a GIRAFFE.
MISS FORCIBLE
I see a giraffe.
MISS SPINK
Giraffes don't just fall from the sky,
Miriam.
The stuck candy dish suddenly CRASHES to the floor.
MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
Oh!
MISS FORCIBLE
Oh, lord!
Coraline asks in a practical voice:
CORALINE
Well, what should I do?
MISS SPINK
Never wear green in your dressing room.
MISS FORCIBLE
Acquire a very tall step ladder.
MISS SPINK
And be very, very careful. Now, was there
something you came to tell us?
Coraline thinks it over, then shakes her head.
CORALINE
No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea,
though.
She gets up and leaves, the dogs immediately return to
their sofa.
MISS FORCIBLE
Toodle-oo.
MISS SPINK
Cheery-bye.
The ladies resume their card game with Miss Spink turning
to the dogs.
MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
Do you have any nice Queens for mummy?
She gives chase after the mice, hopping down the stairs
with the cheese.
Coraline follows the kangaroo mice directly to the little
door, opened a crack, where they disappear.
She pulls it open. Bricks are gone; tunnel revealed. She
doesn't hesitate this time to crawl through the door.
Coraline enters Other Kitchen to find Other Mother
preparing a delicious breakfast. She looks PRETTIER
tonight; her black hair shining, lips REDDER. She stops
HUMMING A LULLABY to greet Coraline.
OTHER MOTHER
Welcome back, darling.
CORALINE
Hi.
She is grating YELLOW CHEESE into scrambled eggs.
OTHER MOTHER
So thoughtful of you to send this nice
cheddar, Coraline.
CORALINE
Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait...
OTHER MOTHER
Would you go fetch your father?
Beams at Coraline.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
Bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now!
CORALINE
You mean my Other Father?
OTHER MOTHER
Your better father, dear.
He's out in
the garden.
CORALINE.
But my parents don't have time to garden.
Other Mother SHUSHES her and pops a strawberry in her
mouth.
CORALINE
Mmmmmm!
OTHER MOTHER
Go on...
Coraline shrugs okay, starts for the door.
EXT STUDY DOOR TO BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS
Looking out, she sees the broken-down garden from the
real world, still grey and lifeless in the dim light.
Coraline doesn't hold back this time. She stacks sausages
on eggs on top of waffles, rolls it up and stuffs it in
her mouth. The Other Mother FEEDS BITS OF SAUSAGE to the
HUNGRY SNAPDRAGONS bouquet now in a vase.
CORALINE
Mmmm...so good!
OTHER FATHER
I love dinner, breakfast food.
OTHER MOTHER
Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to
come see the Jumping Mice perform after
dinner.
CORALINE
Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it
was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was
wrong.
OTHER FATHER
Well, everything's right in this world,
Kiddo.
Coraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal, while
her Other Parents smile at one another.
OTHER MOTHER
Your father and I will clean up while you
and your friend head upstairs.
CORALINE
My friend?
There's a KNOCK at the door. Other Mother opens it to
reveal the OTHER WYBIE. He's cleaner, with better
posture, and cute button eyes.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were-
you-born.
The boy nods, button eyes shining.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Hello?
He just makes a shy smile, doesn't answer. She's
confused.
OTHER MOTHER
I thought you'd like him more, if he
spoke a little less.
(shrugs, smiling)
So I fixed him.
CORALINE
So he can't talk at all?
OTHER MOTHER
Nope.
She looks Other Wybie over appreciatively.
CORALINE
Hmm, I like it.
OTHER MOTHER
(PROUDLY)
Now run along, you two, and have fun.
Coraline heads out the door with the mute boy.
They somersault to a stop and sit up. Down two rows of
SMALL CANNONS that face each, an amazing MINIATURE CIRCUS
has been set up, with a FERRIS WHEEL beside it.
CORALINE
Whoa... cool!
Coraline goes right to the Ferris wheel where a
MECHANICAL CHICKEN eats dried corn on the cob, fires up
its belly, then POOPS OUT POPCORN into paper bags.
Other Wybie stomps a firing button and COTTON CANDY
shoots out of a cannon. He catches the cone, then starts
firing off all the cannons. Coraline looks back to find
him covered in the cotton candy.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Look at you!
Spotlights come on in the big top, the entrance opens,
and a big voice is heard over loudspeakers.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)
Lady and gentleman! For to tickle your
eyes and ears and making hearts to thump,
I  Sergei Alexander Bobinsky  am
introducing...
They race to the entrance, stoop down to crawl inside.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)
... my as-tound-ishing, stu-pen-dulous
and AH-MAZING Jumping Mouse Circus!
They sit between miniature grandstands and watch as the
little BLIMP, bathed in spotlights, enters through a
flap. It circles around, rising to the top of the tent,
then NOSE-DIVES towards the ground! It CRASHES in the
center of the circus ring, and OPENS LIKE A FLOWER from
which 50 JUMPING MICE spring up like Chinese acrobats to
spell out C O R A L I N E.
CORALINE
(DELIGHTED)
My name!
The jumping mice leap to the ground in formation,
BRANDISH TINY INSTRUMENTS, and DRUMMERS START POUNDING.
The DRUM MAJOR MOUSE parachutes down and whips out a
BATON. On his signal, the group launch into a WILD
RUSSIAN CIRCUS MARCH.
Coraline, grinning, turns to the Other Wybie.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
It's wonderful, Wybie!
The boy smiles and nods to the beat of the bass drums as
the hopping band marches in and out of ever changing
formations - PINWHEELS, X's, CIRCLES WITHIN CIRCLES.
They hoppers begin to SPIRAL to the center of the circus
ring when the floor RISES UP from its center to form a
six-foot Tower of Babel, the mice HOPPING TO THE TOP. The
DRUM MAJOR balances on the tippy-top on a COLORFUL CIRCUS
BALL.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Wow!
He RUNS the ball DOWN AND AROUND the spiral as the MICE
HOP OFF, and when he hits the ground, the TOWER DROPS
AWAY to reveal the OTHER MISTER BOBINSKY! He CRACKS A
WHIP.
Coraline and Other Wybie STAND and CLAP. Other Bobinsky 
in a RINGMASTER'S OUTFIT with a full length cape  bows
graciously, doffing his tall black hat. His moustache is
waxed, his eyes black buttons.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great!
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
Very very thank you, lady and gentleman.
On cue, the entire jumping mice band DISAPPEARS INTO
OTHER MR. B'S SLEEVES while the drum major SWINGS UP from
the man's moustache and onto his head, where he's quickly
hidden by the tall black hat.
CORALINE
We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so--
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
(COACHING)
AHHHHHH---
CORALINE
A-mazing!
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
You are very velcome anytime you like,
you and also your good friend there.
She happily turns to Other Wybie, beaming with joy.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY(CONT'D)
Dosvedanya, Coraline.
Bobinsky takes her hand to kiss it.
Other Mother kisses SLEEPING CORALINE'S forehead, sits
back in the bedside chair. Other Father, close by, pulls
a cotton candy cone off Other Wybie and munches it.
Coraline's Other Parents smile warmly, knowing something
secret that makes them glad.
PULL BACK MATCH
DISSOLVE:
EARLY MORNING. Coraline once again wakes in own bed in
the real world, the little doll  left on the chair  now
clutched against her chest.
CORALINE
Ughhh.
Her gaze moves from the doll to where she left the cheese
by the door. It's GONE. This is much too confusing.
Coraline tries the small door in the corner wall. It's
locked. What the heck?
PRESIDENT'S DAY SALE. Mel piles gray blouses, a navy
skirt, white socks onto the arms of a CLERK.
Sitting alone on some stairs, Coraline sees a pair of
fancy GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES.
As she tries them on, a YOUNG RASCAL in costume with
sword BOUNCES PAST her down the stairs on a WHEELED STEP
STOOL - his FATHER in pursuit.
YOUNG RASCAL
My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!!
There's an off screen crash, then the step stool rolls
back to Coraline. She gets an idea.
Mel is checking out school blouses, when Coraline rolls
past, first one direction, then the other, modeling the
colorful gloves. Without looking up, her mom tells her:
MEL
Put them back.
CORALINE
But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear
boring gray clothes. No one will have
these.
MEL
Put them back.
Coraline mutters:
CORALINE
My other mother would get them.
MEL
Maybe she should buy all your clothes.
Coraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves.
Coraline and Mel are driving home, shopping bags in back.
CORALINE
So what do you think's in the other
apartment?
MEL
I don't know. Not a family of Jones
imposters.
CORALINE
Then why'd you lock the door?
MEL
(shorter than previous)
Oh, I found some rat crap and... I
thought you'd feel ... safer.
CORALINE
They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams
aren't dangerous; they're the most fun
I've had since we've moved here.
MEL
Your school might be fun.
CORALINE
With those stupid uniforms?
Right.
MEL
Had to give it a try.
They pull into their DRIVEWAY.
Mel pulls out salsa, mustard, catsup, stale tortillas
from the fridge.
MEL
How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup-
salsa wrap for lunch?
Coraline, carrying in the bags from outside, makes a
face.
CORALINE
Are you kidding me?
MEL
Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway.
Dad's planning something special.
Coraline squinches up her nose.
CORALINE
Gross-gusting.
MEL
(BRIGHTENS )
You wanna come along? You can pick out
something you like.
Coraline plops down in a chair.
CORALINE
Oh, like the gloves?
Mel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair. The girl
pulls away.
MEL
Look, Coraline... if things go well
today, I promise I'll make it up.
CORALINE
That's what you always say.
Mom rolls her eyes, shaking her head, and opens the door
to leave.
MEL
Won't be long.
Shuts the door.
CORALINE
(MUTTERS)
But I might be...
She leaves.
Coraline pulls open the key drawer, looking for the small
black key. Not there. She looks around, then spots it
hanging on a hook above a door. She stands on a chair and
snags it.
Coraline stoops in front of the small door and pushes the
key into the keyhole and unlocks the door.
She listens for her mother's car. Nothing. Grasping the
key between thumb and forefinger, she closes her eyes,
she pulls the door open.
ANGLE ON CORALINE: A SOFT BREEZE MOVES her hair. She
knows before her eyes open that the BRICKS ARE GONE.
CORALINE
(TRIUMPHANT)
I knew it was real!
She opens her eyes, smiles, and CRAWLS FORWARD.
ANGLE ON CORALINE THROUGH WINDOW. CAMERA PULLS BACK and
we FIND the BLACK CAT, perched on the wet window sill,
OBSERVING Coraline as she disappears into the tunnel.
With a look of concern, he exits frame.
Lunch is ready and waiting for her: foot-long hotdogs
with relish; grilled cheese sandwiches with gherkins;
curly-fries; piles of coleslaw and potato salad; five
flavors of soda-pop. There's a NOTE attached to a GIFT-
WRAPPED BOX:
OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
Dearest Coraline,
M
iss Spink and Miss Forcible have invited
you downstairs after lunch. I hope you
like the new outfit I made you! Love,
Mother.
Coraline tears open the box and finds a pair of beautiful
BLUE BOOTS, BLACK CORDUROY TROUSERS, and a METALLIC GREY
SWEATER WITH TWINKLING STARS.
She holds up the sweater to her body, smiles, then puts
down the clothes and digs into lunch.
She pushes past elegant VELVET CURTAINS to discover an
enormous, darkened THEATER with dim rows of seats and a
high WOODEN STAGE.
A FLASHLIGHT comes towards her, carried by a black
SCOTTIE DOG with button eyes. He looks up at her, sniffs,
then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of
BUTTON-EYED SCOTTIES, to a front seat by the Other Wybie.
She squeezes his arm hello, he looks back warmly.
CORALINE
Hey, Wybie.
Light flash, the audience quiets, then the curtains open
on a SEASIDE SETTING with ROTATING WAVES. OTHER MISS
SPINK rises up on stage left, in a MERMAID SUIT, large
WIG, BUTTON EYES, and UKULELE.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
(SHOCKED)
She's practically naked!
And Miss Spink sings.
OTHER MISS SPINK
I'm known as the siren of all seven seas
The breaker of hearts by the bay.
A flat cut-out ship manned by cut-out men rows in behind
her.
OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
So, if you go swimmin'
With bow-legged women,
I might steal your weak heart away.
She bows her head and the audience of dogs THUMP their
tails.
Spink is LOWERED through the stage floor, the SCENERY
CHANGES, and on the right, a huge SCALLOP SHELL RISES up
with the OTHER MISS FORCIBLE, clad in the bare minimum -
her homage to Botticelli's BIRTH OF VENUS. She's facing
the wrong way.
CORALINE
(whisper, to Wybie)
Oh my God.
A dog HOWLS, alerting the near-blind lady, who turns to
the audience and begins the next verse.
OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through
the waves,
And hope to lead sailors astray,
But a true ocean goddess,
Must fill out her bodice,
(indicates her ample bosom)
To present an alluring display.
The dogs thump and woof, Wybie and Coraline clap.
Spink, furious at the greater reaction, gets back in the
competition. Rising up, she makes it clear just who she's
dissing.
OTHER MISS SPINK
Beware of old oysters, too large in the
chest,
Let's banish them from the buffet.
But Forcible is up to the challenge - the scenery starts
to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and
down, competing.
OTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D)
I'm far more nutritious
OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
You smell like the fishes
OTHER MISS SPINK
Did I hear a banshee?
OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
You're sea-green with envy
OTHER MISS SPINK
This mermaid enchantress,
OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
No, I "Birth of Venus!"
The set rigging can't take it anymore -- ropes snap,
sandbags swing, scenery starts to fall.
OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
(CONT'D)
Will send sailors swooning --oh--!
OTHER MISS SPINK
Will send sailors swooning --oh--!
With a crash, the old ladies TUMBLE DOWN IN A PILE.
Coraline winces. The audience HOWLS with laughter as the
curtains close on the disaster.
DRUM ROLL. A SCOTTIE DOG pushes a large BUCKET OF WATER,
labeled "POOL", onto center stage. Spotlights tilt up to
the top of very tall diving platforms WHERE THE OLD
LADIES NOW STAND. Coraline can't stand it.
CORALINE
(WHISPERS)
I can't look!
OTHER MISS SPINK
Ready to break a leg, Miriam?
OTHER MISS FORCIBLE
Our lives for the theater, April!
They begin to bounce on the diving boards. As they bounce
up, the two troupers unzip FAT SUIT DISGUISES from which
emerge their YOUNGER BEAUTIFUL SELVES which LEAP to catch
matching TRAPEZE BARS that swing into place.
Coraline LAUGHS with relief and amazement, Other Wybie
pleased. Dogs WOOF, MUSIC BEGINS and the TWO BEAUTIES 
eyes BRIGHT BUTTONS, SEXY BATHING SUITS striped pink and
green  SWING OUT over the stage.
YOUNG FORCIBLE
What a piece of work is man!
How noble in reason!
They FLY past each other on their trapezes, double up,
catch one another hand to ankle. We notice a LARGE PEARL
RING on Forcible's finger.
YOUNG SPINK
How infinite in faculty!
In form and moving how express and
admirable!
In a SUDDEN change of direction, they SWING OUT over the
audience, trapeze bar LOWERING and PULL CORALINE INTO THE
AIR! She HOLLERS, terrified.
They expertly TOSS HER one to the other, FLIPPING AND
SPINNING, as they continue their lines. Her SCREAMS
become CRIES OF EXHILARATION.
YOUNG FORCIBLE
In action like an angel!
YOUNG SPINK
In apprehension how like a god!
CORALINE
Ahhh!!!
YOUNG FORCIBLE
The beauty of the world!
YOUNG SPINK
The paragon of animals!
Coraline swings face-to-face to the dogs in the royal box
seats where one licks her.
CORALINE
Yeah!!
The acrobats TOSS CORALINE UP into the air and JACK-KNIFE
DIVE into the large bucket below. They rise up, unhurt,
just in time to catch Coraline. The THREE BOW to
THUNDEROUS THUMPING APPLAUSE and, as the camera pulls
back on the scene, Other Wybie throws her a rose!
OTHER MOTHER
You could stay here forever... if you
want to.
CORALINE
Really?
OTHER FATHER
Sure...we'll sing and play games, and
Mother will cook your favorite meals.
Other Mother rests her hand on Coraline's shoulder.
OTHER MOTHER
There's one tiny little thing we need to
do.
CORALINE
What's that?
OTHER FATHER
Well, it's a surprise.
Coraline is seated in her place. The Other Mother places
a SMALL BOX with a bow in front of her, and takes her
seat along with Other Father. Coraline excitedly removes
the lid.
OTHER MOTHER
For you ... our little doll.
The "surprise" is a spool of BLACK THREAD, a SILVER
NEEDLE, and a pair of SHINY BLACK BUTTONS -- FOR
CORALINE'S EYES.
Coraline GASPS. She looks up at her Other Parents, hoping
it's a bad joke.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
(SMILING)
Black is traditional, but if you'd prefer
pink or vermillion or chartreuse...
Coraline sees their button eyes changing colors, growing
ever more panicked.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
... though you might make me jealous.
CORALINE
NO WAY!
She bats the box away, and her hands FLY to her face,
COVER her eyes.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
YOU'RE NOT SEWING BUTTONS IN MY EYES!
OTHER MOTHER
Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to
stay here.
Other Father tests the needle on his finger.
OTHER FATHER
(ENTHUSIASTIC)
So sharp you won't feel a thi-- Oww!
Other Mother KICKS him under the table. Embarrassed, he
puts the needle back in the box.
OTHER MOTHER
There now; it's your decision, darling.
We only want what's best for you.
She walks over and puts her hand, now ICY COLD, on
Coraline's shoulder. Coraline PUSHES it away and STANDS
UP.
CORALINE
I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW!
OTHER MOTHER
(WOUNDED)
Bed?
OTHER FATHER
Before dinner?
Coraline fights to control her quaking voice.
CORALINE
I'm really, really tired. Yeah...
(fakes huge yawn)
I just need to sleep on things.
Other Mother stands, masking disappointment.
OTHER MOTHER
Well of course you do, darling... I'll be
happy to tuck you in.
Coraline backs away, urging them to stay where they are.
CORALINE
(palms out, forced smile)
Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so
much already--
She turns to leave and finds the Other Mother BLOCKING
THE DOORWAY. Other Father joins her.
OTHER MOTHER
You're welcome. And I 
(smiles to Other Father)
we aren't worried at all, darling.
(SOFTLY)
Soon you'll see things our way.
She lets go. She and the Other Father herd Coraline
across the hallway to the stairs.
Coraline carefully climbs the stairs, the Other Parents
watching. When they can no longer see her, she RACES up
the last steps and DASHES to her Other Bedroom.
Coraline shuts the door and is quickly surrounded by
fluttering DRAGONFLIES.
MAGIC DRAGONFLY
What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to
play?
She jumps up and CATCHES the paper creatures, opens the
TOY CHEST and tosses them in.
The PLUSH BLUE SQUID greets her from the shelf, followed
by the TOY TANK GIRAFFE.
TOY SQUID
Yeah, I wanna hugga your face!
TOY TANK GIRAFFE
Get a grip, soldier.
She GRABS them both and drops them in the toy chest.
Her PHOTO FRIENDS - NOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS FOR EYES -
call out from the photo by her bed.
PHOTO FRIENDS
Hey!
PHOTO FRIEND 1
Where's yer buttons, yuper?
PHOTO FRIEND 2
You wanna stay, don'tcha?
Coraline grabs them as well, drops them in the chest, and
SHUTS the lid. She barricades the door with a DRESSER and
CHAIRS and then the TOY CHEST.
CORALINE
I'm going home tonight, robots - and I
won't be back.
She sits on the bed, pulls off the blue boots then CLIMBS
UNDER THE COVERS, pulling them over her head and holding
tight. She HUGS herself to stop shaking, knowing she must
fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at
home. She closes her eyes and tells herself:
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go
to sleep!
She tosses one way, then another. WE HEAR her voice
CONTINUE:
CORALINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Go to sleep, go to sleep...
There are strange, backwards sounds, then the eerie
voices of Other Mother and Other Father.
OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
There's just one tiny little thing we
have to do.
CORALINE
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...
OTHER FATHER (V.O.)
So sharp you won't feel a thing...
CORALINE
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep...
OTHER MOTHER (V.O.)
Soon you'll see things our way...
Coraline fidgets and turns and turns again but sleep
finally wraps her and takes her to oblivion.
MATCH PULLBACK
DISSOLVE:
We see Coraline's room, BRIGHTLY LIT LIKE MORNING IN THE
REAL WORLD.
ANGLE ON Coraline's face beneath the covers, as she's
WOKEN by the light. With a hopeful look, she calls out,
pulls back the covers:
CORALINE
Mom!... Dad!..
Her smile turns to shock -- there's a BRIGHT, FULL MOON
in her window and it's STILL NIGHTTIME IN THE OTHER
WORLD.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Oh God, I'm still here?
Coraline races downstairs to the Other Living Room where
the little door home must be! But the living room is
LOCKED TIGHT. She pulls at the handles, plants a foot and
tries with all her might! It's no use. She stops,
panting, then hears a piano note being hit over and over.
Coraline opens the door and finds the Other Father
sitting at the piano, his back to her, hitting the note.
She speaks in her bravest voice.
CORALINE
Hey you! Where's the Other Mother?
I
want to go home.
The Other Father turns around. He looks ill; his hair
messed and his glasses askew. He speaks, his voice slowed-
down.
OTHER FATHER
All will be swell, soon as Mother's
refreshed. Her strength is our strength.
The WHITE-GLOVED HANDS POP OUT from the piano. One COVERS
HIS MOUTH, the other WAGS A FINGER in his face.
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.
CORALINE
If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna
find the Other Wybie. He'll help me.
She turns to go.
OTHER FATHER
No point; he pulled a long face...
He PULLS DOWN the corners of his mouth impossibly far.
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D)
...and Mother didn't like it.
The PIANO HANDS pop out again, aggressively SHUT HIS
MOUTH and SPIN HIM away from Coraline. Frightened, she
runs to the door that leads outside, and pulls it open.
OTHER HALLWAY - SAME
Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors,
TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for
danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of
anything.
She JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS
with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the
door swings open into the pitch black living room. The
hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other
Little Door on the far wall, cracked open. She steps into
the room.
A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path,
blocking the little door, and all around her things start
to glow. The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing
BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens
in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The
radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a
serving bug.
The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline.
OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
They say even the proudest --
The sofa, now a LARGE BUG, turns in place to reveal her
sitting on it.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
--spirit can be broken ... with love.
She's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out
in a behold my handiwork gesture.
A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the
Other Mother.
The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like
one?
She extends a CANDY DISH filled LIVING CHOCOLATE BEETLES.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar.
Coraline is disgusted. The Other Mother takes back the
dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE. It's the first thing
she's eaten in the film.
CORALINE
I want to be with my real mom and dad. I
want you to let me go.
The Other Mother FROWNS, swallows. She speaks with a
FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice.
OTHER MOTHER
Is that any way to talk to your mother?
Coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave.
CORALINE
You aren't my mother.
The Other Mother STRAIGHTENS. Her button eyes, now DEAD,
stare into Coraline's.
OTHER MOTHER
Apologize at once, Coraline!
Coraline stares right back, not blinking.
CORALINE
No.
OTHER MOTHER
(TENSELY)
I'll give you to the count of three.
One...
Then she stands up, GROWING TALLER.
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
...two...
She grows TALLER STILL and SCARIER like a super model on
steroids.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
...THREE!
This TALL OTHER MOTHER GRABS Coraline by her NOSE and
DRAGS her to the hallway.
CORALINE
Ow, what are you doing!
She PULLS Coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the
end. Coraline flails at the Tall Other Mother with her
fists.
CORALINE
Ow, that hurts!
Tall Other Mother SHOVES Coraline RIGHT THROUGH THE
MIRROR as if it was water!
Coraline HITS the ground hard. The Tall Other Mother,
head thrust through the mirror, stares down at her
angrily.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
You may come out when you've learned to
be a loving daughter!
She PULLS HER HEAD OUT and leaves Coraline in DARKNESS.
Coraline pounds on the mirror-door, kicks it with her
blue boots. A SOB wells up in her throat.
And then we hear a SOFT GHOSTLY MOAN.
She turns. She can just make out a sagging iron bed. When
the voice speaks, there is a faint glow from beneath its
stained cover.
CORALINE
(FRIGHTENED)
Who's there?
TALL GIRL GHOST (O.S.)
(WHISPERS)
Hush! And shush! For the Beldam might be
listening!
Coraline steps towards the bed, the faint glow from under
the covers in sync with the words she hears.
CORALINE
(WHISPERS)
You ... you mean the Other Mother? ...
She gently pulls back the sheets.
The DIMLY GLOWING GHOSTS of THREE CHILDREN, BUTTON EYES,
SIT UP: a SWEET GIRL GHOST, Coraline's size; a TALL GIRL
GHOST, emotional; a young BOY GHOST, very sad.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Who are you?
BOY GHOST
(WISTFUL)
Don't remember our names... But I `member
my true mommy...
The boy, dressed like Huck Finn, CONJURES up ghost
flowers.
The strange-looking flowers wither and fade. He's so sad
that Coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it.
CORALINE
Why are you all here?
ALL GHOSTS
The Beldam!
The ghosts move about in a dance macabre, like ghostly
fish in water.
SWEET GIRL GHOST
She spied on our lives,
through the little doll's eyes,
BOY GHOST
And saw that we weren't
happy.
TALL GIRL GHOST
So she lured us away,
TALL GIRL GHOST (CONT'D)
with treasures and treats,
SWEET GIRL GHOST
and games to play!
BOY GHOST
Gave all that we asked -
SWEET GIRL GHOST
yet we still wanted more -
TALL GIRL GHOST
So we let her sew the buttons.
BOY GHOST
She said that she loved us,
TALL GIRL GHOST
But she locked us here
ALL GHOSTS
And ate up our lives.
The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down.
Coraline is stunned. She thinks a little and then speaks,
trying to steady her voice.
CORALINE
Well, she can't keep me in the dark
forever; not if she wants to win my life.
Beating her is my only chance.
A beat. Then the Sweet Girl asks in her sing-song way:
SWEET GIRL GHOST
Perhaps, if you do win your escape, you
could find our eyes?
CORALINE
Has she taken those, too?
SWEET GIRL GHOST
Yes, miss. And hidden them.
BOY GHOST
Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls
will be freed.
CORALINE
I ... I'll try.
The ghosts PULSE with hope. Coraline sits down against
the mirror door, bounces her head against it. She's not
hopeless.
Suddenly, HANDS REACH THROUGH THE MIRROR and PULL HER
OUT!
C.U. of Coraline's FACE, eyes wild, as she TEARS at the
hands that hold her. She GRABS one and, FLIPS her MASKED
ATTACKER onto the ground. She pulls off his mask: it's
the OTHER WYBIE, his mouth stitched into a PAINFUL, EAR
TO EAR SMILE.
CORALINE
(PANTING)
WYBIE?..
Coraline sits him up.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Did she do this to you?
She unstitches his painfully-huge grin.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I hope that feels bet--
OTHER WYBIE
Shhh.
He stops her with a finger to her lips, and points to the
Other Living Room, its door UNLOCKED AND OPEN. He grabs
her hand and PULLS her there.
It's dark, the bug furniture asleep. They run to the big
armoire bug that guards the little door and SHOVE IT out
of the way. It CRASHES to the floor. And from upstairs, a
voice calls out.
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
Coraline? Is that you!
CORALINE
Let's go!
She opens the little door. A COLD WIND blows from the
dark passageway, now filled with SPIDER WEBS and the
SHOES, COATS, AND HATS of other kids who tried to escape.
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
Coraline...
The tunnel MOVES at the sound of her voice. Coraline
takes Other Wybie's arm.
CORALINE
Come on. She'll hurt you again!
He shakes his head no, then pulls off his glove to reveal
a HAND MADE OF SAWDUST. He blows his fingers away.
HIGH HEELS CLICK from the stairs; she's ALMOST THERE!
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
Coraline? How dare you disobey your
mother!!
Other Wybie shoves Coraline into the tunnel and shuts the
door.
Hunched down, she moves as quickly as she can, tearing
through the sticky cobwebs.
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
(calling after her)
Coraline!
Strands of web brush her face, stick to her hair; she
closes her eyes, hands out until she finally gets to the
little door at the other end. She DIVES, TUCKS, --
-- AND ROLLS OUT onto the REAL LIVING ROOM FLOOR.
Coraline SLAMS the door shut and turns the sharp little
key  still in the keyhole  to LOCK IT.
She stands, covered in dust and cobwebs, and calls out
with joy and relief.
CORALINE
I'M HOME!
She goes quickly through the apartment, happily calling:
CORALINE
Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real
Dad ... Real Mom!
CORALINE
Oh, Mom's groceries!
There are bags of groceries on the table, as if her
mother had just gotten in. She pulls open a bag to peek
and FRUIT FLIES shoot out. The food is spoiled.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
(PUZZLED)
Uhhh. That's disgusting.
Door bell rings.
She runs excitedly to the door and flings it open.
CORALINE
I missed you guys so much-- You'll never--
But it's just Wybie, the real boy.
CORALINE
Oh... the Wybie that talks...
He's waves, face down, awkward.
WYBIE
Huh? Ha ha ha....yeah... Um, so you know
tha-that old doll I gave you?
Coraline tenses, sharp breath.
WYBIE (CONT'D)
Um... my Gramma's real mad, says it was
her sister's - the one that...
disappeared?
She reads him like a book.
CORALINE
(REALIZATION)
You stole that doll, didn't you?
Wybie answers quickly, guilty as heck.
WYBIE.
Well, i-it looked just like you. And I
FIGURED--
Coraline, rushing the words, tells him the truth.
CORALINE
It used to look like this pioneer girl;
then Huck Finn junior; then it was this
Little Rascals chick with all these
ribbons, and braids, and....
Her voice trails off. Coraline studies Wybie, then, snaps
her fingers.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Grandma's missing sister!
He nods, one brow raising up.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I think I just met her. C'mon!
She pulls him inside and--
INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
--drags him down the hall.
WYBIE
Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed
TO--
Coraline WALKS HIM to the LITTLE DOOR in the corner wall
and points. Wybie looks around anxiously, fearful and
curious to be in his grandmother's old house.
CORALINE
She's in there.
Reluctantly, he bends down and reaches for the key in the
lock.
WYBIE
C-can you  can you unlock it?
She grabs his hand, stops him.
CORALINE
Not in a million years. But it wouldn't
matter; she can't escape without her
eyes. None of the ghosts can.
Wybie stares at her, nodding his head as if he
understands her crazy story. He changes the subject, gets
back to his mission.
WYBIE
Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get
that doll?
Coraline snaps at him.
CORALINE
Great! I'd love to get rid of it!
She exhales in a huff. Grabs his sleeve, leads him from
room.
The doll's not on the bed, not on the chairs or moving
boxes.
CORALINE
Where are you hiding, you little
monster?!
Wybie nervously watches Coraline pull out her dresser
drawers, yank cushions off the window seat.
WYBIE
You and Gramma been talking?
CORALINE
The doll's her spy! It's how she watches
you, finds out what's wrong with your
life!
Wybie, trapped like a deer-in-the-headlights, tries to
make sense of her remarks.
WYBIE
The doll...is my Gramma's...spy.
CORALINE
NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this
whole world where everything's better -
the food, the garden, the--
(leans in on him)
--neighbors.
Holds her hands up.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
But it's all a trap!
Wybie, eager to escape, cups hand to ear by the window.
WYBIE
Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone
calling me, Jonesy.
Coraline sees right through him.
CORALINE
Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat!
He moves around her towards the door, turns to leave.
WYBIE
The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that
you couldn't find the doll-- OW!
A blue boot - thrown by Coraline - HITS his arm. He turns
back as she takes off the second one.
CORALINE
You're not LISTENING TO ME!
WYBIE
That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY!
He FLEES as the second boot flies past. Coraline GROWLS,
and gives chase.
INT UPPER STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS
She grabs her boots from the floor, and CHASES him down
the stairs in her socks.
Coraline, standing in the rain, excitedly looks through
the car's window. But the car is EMPTY. She spots her
mom's PHONE, then opens the door to grabs it and speed
dial a number.
CORALINE
Pick it up, Dad, pick it up.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Hi!
CORALINE
Dad!
Whe-
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I'm digging in my garden right now, but
leave a message and I'll get right back
to you.
She dejectedly looks at the phone, then snaps it shut.
CORALINE
Where have you gone?
Miss Spink is knitting a SWEATER WITH WINGS for a worried-
looking ANGUS, one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap.
Coraline sips tea, anxious, the other two DOGS beside
her.
CORALINE
Uh... don't you only make wings for the
... dead ones?
MISS SPINK
Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't
been feeling very well of late.
MISS FORCIBLE (O.S.)
April? Aren't you getting ready?
MISS SPINK
(looks off camera)
We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline
says her parents have vanished, quite
completely.
ANGLE ON Miss Forcible, tightening her elaborate corset
behind a screen, using pulleys and hooks.
MISS FORCIBLE
What?! We've waited months for those
tickets.
One of the corset hooks FLIES UP and pulls off her wig.
She ignores it and comes over to address Spink.
MISS SPINK
I suppose we could walk!
MISS FORCIBLE
With your gamy legs? It's nearly two
miles to the theater!
Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT, frustrated.
MISS SPINK
Oh, oh yes ... your missing parents. We
know just what you need. Miriam,
get...that's right.
Miss Forcible grabs another dish of old stuck-together
candy and puts it in front of Coraline.
CORALINE
How is hundred-year-old candy going to
HELP--
Miss Spink suddenly RAISES her KNITTING NEEDLES as if to
STAB CORALINE. Coraline yelps, hands up in defense. But
it's CANDIES she attacks, sending sticky chips flying,
making loud grunts as she stabs.
She pulls a LARGE, THREE-SIDED CANDY WITH A HOLE IT from
the rubble and passes it to Coraline.
MISS SPINK
There you go, sweety.
Coraline studies the odd candy.
CORALINE
What's it for?
She holds it up, looks through its hole at the ladies.
MISS SPINK
Well,it might help. They're good for bad
things, sometimes.
MISS FORCIBLE
No, they're good for lost things.
They don't look any different.
MISS SPINK
It's bad things, Miriam.
MISS FORCIBLE
Lost things, April.
MISS SPINK
Bad.
MISS FORCIBLE
Lost.
MISS SPINK
Bad things!
MISS FORCIBLE
Lost.
MISS SPINK
Bad.
MISS FORCIBLE
Lost.
Coraline can't take anymore. She gets up, takes the odd
piece of candy and leaves.
Coraline, dressed for bed with her blanket over her
shoulder, walks into her parent's room, the PHOTO of her
and her parents at the Bear Fountain in the foreground.
She pulls down the bed covers and builds COPIES of her
parents out of pillows. She fits an extra neck brace on
one pillow head and some reading glasses on the other.
Then Coraline lies down and pulls up the covers, very
sad.
CORALINE
Good-night, Mom. Good-night, Dad.
She kisses them both and BEGINS TO CRY. CAM PUSHES IN.
DISSOLVE TO:
Coraline, asleep. SOMETHING blurs past camera. One paw
and then two paws bat her nose. She opens her eyes to
find OPAL BLUE EYES staring at her. It's the BLACK CAT,
purring loudly.
CORALINE
Hello. How did you get in?
The cat yawns, his eyes flash.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Do you know where Mom and Dad are?
The cat blinks. Then he heads out the door.
She follows him, wrapped in her blanket, to the MIRROR at
the end of the hallway. The mirror starts to GLOW and
then an IMAGE FORMS within the glass. It's HER PARENTS!
They cling together, blue with cold, as snow falls.
CORALINE
MOM! DAD!!
They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel BREATHES on
the inside mirror-glass to fog it. She writes H E L P U
S.  her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL,
SAD BIRD. Frost RISES UP, hiding the letters and then her
parents. The image fades.
Coraline STRIKES AT THE MIRROR as hard as she can. GLASS
SHATTERS and she drops to the ground, shaking. The cat
nuzzles her..
CORALINE (CONT'D)
How did this happen?
From under the bed, the cat drags out the BUTTON-EYED
DOLL, REMADE into HER MOTHER on one side, and HER FATHER
on the other!
CORALINE
She's taken them.
Coraline, enraged, THROWS the doll. FIRE LIGHT comes up
on her face as the background DISSOLVES TO:
CLOSE ON DOLL: BURNING in the FIREPLACE.
Coraline and cat watch until the fire burns out. She
takes a breath and looks up at the mantel.
ANGLE ON snowglobe, the one of the FOUNTAIN BEARS from
the Detroit Zoo. Coraline cradles it, remembering.
CORALINE
They're not coming back, are they  Mom
and Dad. Not on their own.
The cat blinks. She looks over at the locked little door
in the corner wall.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Only one thing to do.
CUT TO:
INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM
- CONTINUOUS
Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go.
Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest,
her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in
the bag. She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair.
The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the
hole, drops to the floor. She hesitates a moment, then
sticks it in her bag.
We hear the click of the door being unlocked. It opens to
reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline.
She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a
breath and crawls forward.
The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall.
The cat, his voice returned, SPEAKS to her.
CAT
You know, you're walking right into her
trap.
CORALINE
I have to go back.
With great feeling, she explains:
CORALINE (CONT'D)
They are my parents.
CAT
Challenge her then. She may not play
fair but she won't refuse. She's got a
thing for games.
Coraline thinks about it, remembering.
CORALINE
Hmmm, okay.
The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle
BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK. Coraline
tenses when a voice calls out.
MOTHER
Coraline?
CORALINE
Mom?
There, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue,
Coraline's REAL MOTHER, with neck brace and dressed in
her shopping clothes, calls.
MOTHER
Coraline, you came back for us!
CORALINE
(RELIEVED)
MOM!
She runs forward eagerly and--
--out the Other Little Door, throwing her arms out to hug
her real Mom.
MOTHER
Darling!
(voice shifting)
Why would you run away from me?
Coraline sees her mother's hand GROW as it wraps around
her. Alarmed, she PUSHES AWAY and sees the DECOY MOM grow
into the TALL OTHER MOTHER.
The room LIGHTS UP with the glowing bug furniture and a
fireplace fire.
Coraline tries her best to be brave.
CORALINE
Where are my parents?
The Tall Other Mother's button eyes GLITTER.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
Gosh, I have no idea where your "old"
parents are. Perhaps they've grown bored
of you and run away to France?
Her teeth gleam.
CORALINE
They weren't bored of me.
You stole
them!
Other Father, a FOOT SHORTER than before, his sagging
face a pale PUMPKIN color, his hair VINES, comes up
behind Coraline.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a
seat, won't you?
Other Father, GURGLING happily, herds Coraline onto the
walking bug chair.
The Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns
to it and CLAPS her hands.
A moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel -
FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things -
carrying the KEY from the real world door.
The Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and -
while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she
SWALLOWS THE KEY.
CORALINE
(OFFHAND)
Why don't you have your own key?
OTHER FATHER
Only one key.
The Other Mother PULLS A VINE growing from his ear,
SHUTTING HIS MOUTH.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
Shhh!
(SUNNIER)
The garden squash need tending, don't you
think, pumpkin?
She turns him around, her hands under his arms and drags
him out.
OTHER FATHER
Squish squash, pumpkin sauce...
After a beat, Coraline hears the very faint SOUND OF A
FINGER ON GLASS, just like when her mother wrote HELP on
the mirror. Coraline jumps to her feet, looking around
the room for a sign of her real parents.
CORALINE
(loud whisper)
Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you?
A muffled screen door slams O.S. and the Tall Other
Mother calls to her from the kitchen.
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.)
Breakfast-time!
Coraline leaves frame.
Coraline pauses in the doorway.
CORALINE (V.O.)
(to herself)
Be strong, Coraline.
She sits at the kitchen table in her regular place, her
back to the sink.
Tall Other Mother, humming happily, prepares a mushroom
omelet and bacon. Fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the
oven.
At the table's center, Coraline sees the box with her
BUTTON EYES with needle and thread. A bead of sweat rolls
down her forehead. As casually as she can, she asks:
CORALINE (CONT'D)
(anxious, trying to be cool)
Why don't we play ... a game? I know you
like them.
The Tall Other Mother's button eyes FLASH.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
Everybody likes games.
CORALINE
(NODS)
Uh huh.
Bacon sizzles and spits on the stove.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
What kind of game would it be?
CORALINE)
An exploring game ... a finding things
game.
Other Mother tries to act disinterested, but her fingers
drum with excitement.
OTHER MOTHER
And what is it you'd be finding,
Coraline?
Coraline hesitates.
CORALINE
My real parents.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
(DISMISSIVE)
Too easy.
She folds the omelet over in the pan.
CORALINE
And, and the eyes of the ghost children.
Tall Other Mother smiles: now it's getting interesting.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
Huh.
The meal ready, she turns from the stove and takes the
food to Coraline.
TALL OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D)
What if you don't find them?
CORALINE
If I lose, I'll stay here with you
forever and let you love me.
(indicates button box)
And I'll let you sew buttons into my
eyes.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
Hmmm... And if you somehow win this game?
CORALINE
Then you let me go. You let everyone go 
my real father and mother, the dead
children, everyone you've trapped here.
The Tall Other Mother smiles a malicious not in a million
years smile.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
Deal.
She holds out her hand. Coraline doesn't reach.
CORALINE
Not till you give me a clue.
Tall Other Mother snorts, her smile sours. She slowly
circles Coraline, and speaks as if talking to a very
stupid child.
TALL OTHER MOTHER
Oh, right... In each of three wonders
I've made just for you, a ghost's eye is
lost in plain sight.
CORALINE
And for my parents?
Tall Other Mother - standing behind her in front of the
sink - smiles wickedly and just starts TAPPING HER BUTTON
EYE with her finger nail. Coraline turns away from her.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
(SHRUGS)
Fine. Don't tell me...
Extending her hand, Coraline starts to turn back.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
...it's a deal--
But the Tall Other Mother HAS DISAPPEARED and the tapping
now is the FAUCET DRIPPING in the sink.
Coraline EXHALES, walks to the sink, stares at the
dripping faucet.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
What does she mean "wonders?"
Out the kitchen window, the FANTASTIC GARDEN LIGHTS UP,
answering her question. She FURROWS HER BROWS, thinks
this was too easy.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Hmmm.
CUT TO:
Coraline steps into the apartment and carefully shuts the
door. The cannons and Ferris wheel are dark and quiet;
the circus tent glows dimly. Pale green moonlight shines
in patches through holes in the roof. The corners and
edges of the room are very dark.
OTHER BOBINSKY suddenly CRAWLS by the door behind her.
Coraline whips around, on guard. He LOOMS UP past the
cannons on her right, leaning towards her.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
Hello, ga-LOO-boo-shka.
There are too many joints in his arms and legs.
CORALINE
I'm Coraline.
His tall, crooked hat is pulled so low, and his collar so
high, that his face is completely hidden.
He throws out his arm towards her and the CIRCUS BALL
from the mouse circus rolls from his sleeve to his hand.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
Is dis vhat you're looking for?
She looks through the hole of the triangle candy and sees
an AMBER GLOW  the THIRD GHOST'S EYE!
CORALINE
Uh-huh.
She grabs for it, but he's too quick. He back-bends to
all fours and SCUTTLES around her towards the back
shadows.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
You tink vinning game is goot ting?
Coraline holds up the triangle candy, scans the room for
him. His voice sounds distorted now.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.)
(CONT'D)
You'll just go home and be bored and
neglected...
WE SEE him twine up a post behind Coraline, crawl out on
a beam...
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
(CONT'D)
...same as alvays.
He SWINGS UPSIDE-DOWN from his ankles, his head stopping
right by Coraline's. She whips around, alarmed.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
(CONT'D)
Stay here vis us; vee vill listen to you
and laugh vis you.
He DROPS to the floor on his head, then SLITHERS into the
circus tent. Coraline does not want to follow him. But
she does.
The Other Mr. B is perched on a pile of MOLDY CHEESES in
the center of the ring. He moves like all his bones are
broken.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
If you stay here, you can have vhatever
you vant, vsig-DA - alvays.
Coraline raises the triangle candy to her eye, sees the
AMBER GLOW coming from inside his hat.
CORALINE
You don't get it, do you?
She moves closer.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
I don't understand.
Small forms MOVE under the back of his coat.
CORALINE
Of course you don't understand. You're
just a copy she made of the real Mr. B.
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY
(last breath)
Not even that anymore.
Coraline pulls off his hat. Instead of his head, a HUGE
PALE RAT SITS THERE - holding the circus ball. It barks
at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar.
RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls
back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around
for the circus ball.
There's a rat bark behind her and she turns. The HUGE RAT
- balanced on a wheel of cheese, circus ball in paws -
TAUNTS HER, then RUNS THE CHEESE OUT THE DOOR! She GIVES
CHASE.
The OTHER RATS RACE behind the twin rows of cannons - the
cheese wheel rat rolls through them, heading towards the
door!
Coraline CHARGES. The cannons, manned by rats, FIRE
COTTON CANDY at her. She's HIT in the side, her leg, her
ribs; she weaves and STUMBLES, the shots landing like
punches.
CORALINE
Ahhh! No!!
A PET DOOR - perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel -
appears in the front door as the rat approaches.
Coraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE-
WHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE.
Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as
hard as she can AT THE RAT.
The whistling candy FLIES through the pet door towards
the RAT, just outside.
Coraline, lurching forward, HOLLERS.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
NOOOO!
Two waiting rats - tail tips tied - pull tails tight, and
TRIP her. She CRASHES THROUGH THE DOOR AND--.
It's dark and stable in here, with just some creaks and
intermittent vibrations. A poisonous green light spills
from the other living room.
Coraline goes there, carrying the cat over her shoulder,
past wallpaper that PEELS UP as she passes, to the room
where she last heard the sound of her mother's finger on
glass.
A poisonous GREEN FIRE - LIKE SLEEPY SEA SNAKES - BURNS
in the fireplace. The bug furniture looks grey now, their
lights flickering as if short-circuited; legs and wings
twitching uncontrollably.
Coraline scans the walls, the ceiling, looking for a sign
of her parents.
ANGLE ON CORALINE in foreground. She senses the Other
Mother behind her, a creature who is no sort of Mother at
all but a witch, a Beldam. She turns.
The Beldam is hunched on the sofa - her face hidden.
BELDAM
So, you're back....
Her voice sounds dry and tired. She turns her face
towards Coraline. It is a WHITE DEATH MASK, cracked and
peeling - her true face.
BELDAM (CONT'D)
And you brought vermin with you.
Coraline shudders and steps back. The cat makes a fearful
sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.
CORALINE
No, I ... I brought a friend.
The Beldam rises up 12 FEET TALL. She is WITHERED to the
bone; with plate-like shoulders and hips; her bustle now
an arachnid's tail section. Her true form.
She reaches her long, sharp FINGERS MADE OF NEEDLES to
Coraline's face.
BELDAM
(FLATLY)
You know I love you.
Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.
CORALINE
You, you have a very funny way of showing
it.
The Beldam smiles, turns away, then back, her hand
outstretched.
BELDAM
So?
Where are they - the ghost eyes?
Coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and
starts to hand them over. But she catches herself.
CORALINE
Hold on.
And pulls back.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
We aren't finished yet, are we?
The Beldam looks daggers, then smiles sweetly.
BELDAM
No, I suppose not. After all, you still
need to find your old parents, don't you?
Too bad you won't have this.
She produces the TRIANGLE CANDY that Coraline lost and
FLINGS it into the green fire. The Beldam laughs while
the MAGIC BURNS out of the candy with sparks and pops.
ON CORALINE. The third ghost eye PULSES WITH AMBER LIGHT
in her hand. Coraline turns away, so the witch won't see.
SWEET GIRL GHOST (O.S.)
Be clever, miss; even if you win she'll
never let you go!
Coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the
armoire bug and understands: she's got to get the Beldam
to unlock it! She furrows her brow as an idea comes to
her then nods.
She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she
can muster, says:
CORALINE
I already know where you've hidden them.
The Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and
sceptical.
BELDAM
Well... produce them.
Coraline points to the little door.
CORALINE
They're behind that door.
The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and
speaks very quietly.
BELDAM
Oh, they are, are they?
A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS
TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way,
as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the
armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline.
Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on
wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming
from?!
The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES
SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline --
CAT
There!
-- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE -
OPAQUE WITH FROST.
C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass
is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see
the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED
PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back
from them.
CORALINE
(WHISPERING)
Mom.
Dad!
ON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's
discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns
to Coraline, expectantly.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Go on.
Open it. They'll be there, all
right.
The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns
it, leaves the key in place.
She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song
voice.
BELDAM
You're wrong, Coraline!
She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider-
web tunnel.
ON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat -
obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's
thinking very hard.
BELDAM (CONT'D)
(PITYING)
They aren't there.
She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK
BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the
Beldam softly gloats:
BELDAM (CONT'D)
Now you're going to stay here forever.
Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the
fury she can.
CORALINE
No ... I'm ...
She GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER
HEAD.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
NOT!
And she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL -
face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and
lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD.
FREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the
shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little
door.
Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside,
stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door
from the other side.
The Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A
BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO
SHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAM'S EYES!
ANGLE ON CAT as he's thrown on armoire bug.
ON BELDAM, hands covering her face.
BELDAM
NOOOOOOOOO!
Her hands pull away to show EMPTY, FLAT SOCKETS and TORN
THREAD!
BELDAM (CONT'D)
You horrible cheating girl!
She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral
of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center.
A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR!
The web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT.
There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS.
The cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture
straight to the little door and disappears into the
tunnel.
Coraline falls the very bottom of the web.
Fifty feet above, the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS
DOWN like a huge, flying spider!
Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the
trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS.
The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around,
grasping blindly.
BELDAM (CONT'D)
Noo!! Where are you? You selfish brat!!
Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE
DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room.
She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS
CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks
free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB
TO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM.
BELDAM (CONT'D)
Hahahaha...
The Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now!
Coraline makes it to the little door, but the BELDAM IS
COMING UP BEHIND HER VERY FAST!
BELDAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
YOU ... DARE ...
Coraline SCRAMBLES through the door, KEY IN HAND, and
grabs the door's handle. Before she can shut it, the
BELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE.
BELDAM
... DISOBEY YOUR MOTHER??!!
Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The
cat takes off down the tunnel.
Coraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB
HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN!
CORALINE
PLEASE...SHUT!!
The ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT
FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip
the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED.
The door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY
at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one
thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the
Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then
SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the
ground!
She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement!
Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when
it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming
through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped
down, as fast as she can.
The pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing.
BELDAM (O.S.)
DON'T LEAVE ME! DON'T LEAVE ME!!! I'LL
DIE WITHOUT YOU!!!!
And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW
SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far
door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side
STARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER!
Ahead, DAYLIGHT APPEARS, and then the LITTLE DOOR TO THE
REAL WORLD!
Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND
LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split-
second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A
CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door
and lock, hold. It's over...
Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's
ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows
a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first
since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue
with white clouds.
She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the
ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside.
She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes
and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE!
She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her
hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny
bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She
looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE.
She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and
neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside.
As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe,
Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does
this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY
REAL MOTHER calls to her.
MEL (O.S.)
Coraline? We're home!
Her TRUE PARENTS enter the room from the hallway, a
dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair.
CORALINE
Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!
Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around
them.
MEL
Missed us?
C.U. ON CORALINE. Huh?
Mel notices the broken snow globe.
MEL (CONT'D)
Oh no, you broke my favorite snow globe.
CORALINE
I didn't break it. It must've broke when
you escaped.
Mom spots her bloody knee.
MEL
And cut your knee.
Charlie crouches low, clutching his briefcase.
CHARLIE
Coraline, I asked you to count all the
windows, not put your knee through them.
CORALINE
BUT-
Mel tells her.
MEL
Well, get yourself cleaned up,
(WARMS)
we're going out tonight.
CHARLIE
We gotta lot to celebrate!
Coraline, confused, takes a stab.
CORALINE
You're talking about... your garden
catalog?
MEL
Of course! What else?
Her parents turn to leave the room.
CORALINE
But look at the snow on your clothes...?
But the snow melts without a trace.
MEL
(CONFUSED)
What's gotten into you, Coraline?
Her parents walk off. Coraline shrugs her shoulders and
looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel. She
cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT HOUSE - NIGHT, SKY CLEAR
The VW is parked out front, its interior light fading as
light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on. We HEAR
Charlie make a strangled sound.
Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED,
wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string
around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night
sky.
Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's
an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the
bed. Coraline LAUGHS.
CORALINE
So, gonna order the tulips?
He opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this.
CHARLIE
What's that?
CORALINE
For the garden party!!
He sits up and kids her, tickling her face with the
squid.
CHARLIE
I have no idea what you're talking about.
CORALINE
Dad!
She turns to Mom, arranging things on a shelf.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the
invitations.
Her mother nods, points up.
MEL
Even Bobinsky?
CORALINE
Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's
just...eccentric.
Charlie LAUGHS. He bends down to kiss her.
CHARLIE
Good night, Coraline.
As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers
next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a "told you so"
look, and she and Charlie leave the room.
Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the
GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES she'd wanted! She pulls one on to
admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window
CORALINE
Oh, hello again.
She walks over to the window, opens it.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
You still mad?
His expression says yes, he's still mad.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the
Other Mother?  it was all I could think
of.
The cat's angry expression softens. He rests his head on
her hand, licking her fingers and purrs.
Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and
carries him over to her bed.
She grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large
PEARL, the CIRCUS BALL, and the GREY STICKSHIFT KNOB. She
holds them out to the cat.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
I think it's time, don't you? To set them
free?
The cat nods. She puts the ghost eyes under her pillow
and gently lays down, the cat lying beside her. The two
of them close their eyes, and in no time at all, they
doze off to sleep. WE SLOWLY TILT UP.
MATCH MOVE DISSOLVE TO:
-- ROLLS HERSELF AWAKE IN HER OWN BED. FAST PULL BACK
above her to find covers thrown off and the CAT awake by
her side.
Coraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES
ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs. She takes out the
key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice
PANICKED:
CORALINE
I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s-
somewhere she can never ...
The cat doesn't like the sound of this. Coraline grabs
her blanket and heads to her door. But the cat leaps down
and blocks her way.
CORALINE (CONT'D)
Outta my way!
She sidesteps the cat and leaves her room. The cat glares
after her
Coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads
down the hall. She passes the LIVING ROOM and exits
frame. CAMERA stays on living room, where, on the LITTLE
DOOR in the corner wall, SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE.
WE ROCKET IN AND--
JUMP CUT TO:
The baseboard is PUSHED ASIDE. Through the narrow gap at
the door's bottom, the DISMEMBERED HAND OF THE BELDAM
CRAWLS OUT. It scrambles out of frame in the direction of
Coraline!
EXT ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - SAME
Coraline moves briskly, the house below, GRIPPING THE KEY
that's tied round her neck. DARK, ROPEY CLOUDS reach like
fingers across the gibbous moon. Coraline sings her
father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling.
CORALINE
Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl,
I think you are so nice ...
