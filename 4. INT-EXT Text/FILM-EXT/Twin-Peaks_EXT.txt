As Desmond and Stanley walk to the adjoining morgue they see a pile of
steel BARS similar to the one they saw Cable bending in the picture.
AT THE MORGUE DOOR
Stanley moves up to Desmond and speaks confidentially.
STANLEY
You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this

Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty

Where are we going to
sleep?
DESMOND
We're not.
You and I are going to get
some food.
STANLEY
Yes, it's been several hours since we've
eaten.
I didn't realize that so much
time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?

No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean
just exactly what I say.
STANLEY
In that case, we should go to the Canyon

STANLEY AND DESMOND
Thanks, Irene.

Good morning.
STANLEY
Thank god it is morning.
23.
CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAWN
Desmond and Stanley drive thru to the manager's trailer which is
surrounded by a small white picket fence.
They park and step to the
trailer.
Desmond knocks twice on the door.
From inside they hear a
voice that makes Cole's voice sound like a whisper.
VOICE
OH, GOD, WHAT...
WHAT...
Just then Desmond and Stanley notice a sign on the door that reads.
"DO NOT EVER DISTURB BEFORE 9
A.M...
EVER"
VOICE
CAN'T YOU READ!
STANLEY
Nine's really late.
We are really early.
They both fumble for their badges as they hear the manager coming
closer to the door.
They meet the manager, CARL RODD.
CARL
God damn, this better be
important.
He stops in the middle of this when he sees the badges.
DESMOND
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special
Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam
Stanley.
Sorry to disturb you, but we
would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer,
please.
CARL
More popular than Uncle's Day at a
whorehouse.
(takes one step out of his trailer)
GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS
BRIGHT!
BLUE BRIGHT.
Carl steps thru the little picket fence's gate and leads them towards
Teresa's Trailer.
CARL (continued)
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she
lives in town.
Teresa rented it about a
month ago.
DESMOND
Did she have someone with her?
CARL
Right.
She had a friend with her.
The
friend took off.
DESMOND
Was there an argument?
CARL
Not that I know of.
But arguments do
happen, don't they?
DESMOND
Yes they do.
Did she have visitors?
CARL
No, hey, I already told this whole damn
thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite-Able"...
Here's the trailer now.
He swings open the door.
CARL (continued)
And this is exactly the way she left it.
I
never touched a GOD DAMN THING.
(frustration rising)
GOD!
Desmond and Stanley go in.

CANYON TRAILER COURT - SAME
Desmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches Cliff get
into his car and drive to work.
Stepping away from the trailer Desmond spots something underneath.
He bends down and retrieves a Titleist Golf Ball.
DESMOND
Is there a golf course around here?
CARL
Not a lot around here, no.
Got some
clubs, but not very many fellas with
balls.
Desmond drops the ball in a plastic bag and gives it to Stanley who
puts it in his kit.
Desmond turns to Carl.
DESMOND
Thanks for your help, Carl.
Sorry we
woke you up.
CARL
That's alright.
I was having a bad
dream.
I was dreamin' about a joke
with no punchline.
Desmond and Stanley nod to Carl and walk to their car.
STANLEY
I couldn't help but notice that you had a
suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the
murderer.
You did think that, didn't you,
Agent Desmond?
DESMOND
He's not the murderer.
(after a beat)
But he's a bozo.
STANLEY
Yes, he is like a clown.
Desmond walks around the car to the drivers' side and gets in.

The FBI MOBILE CRIME VAN sits outside as Desmond and Stanley pull up.
30.
BEHIND THE SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Desmond, Cliff, Stanley, Cable, the secretary and the FBI van driver
all have stepped outside by the pile of iron bars.
CABLE
Now, J. Edgar, I'm going to take off my
badge, here.
Do you mind?
(takes his badge off)
The only way you're going to get that
body is over mine.
He picks up a steel bar and bends it ala the picture in his office.
CLIFF
(to Desmond)
You try that you little monkey.
DESMOND
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Desmond takes his coat and badge off.
Cable takes his shirt off and
Desmond follows.
Cable is bare-chested and Desmond is in FBI issue
underwear.
Desmond goes to pick up an iron bar and Cable hits him with a sucker
punch.
As Desmond bends away from this Cable rushes at him.
Desmond
stops him with a few well placed punches to his face.
Cable falls
down and Desmond stands over him.
Chet picks up the steel bar and
bends it.
He then tosses the bar away.
Cable stands up and rushes at Desmond who flips and flops him around.
Cable tries one more grand roadhouse punch which Desmond expertly
ducks.
DESMOND
(eyeing Cable's glass jaw)
This one's comin' from J. Edgar.
Desmond blasts him in the jaw and Cable goes over - lights out, all
systems down.
The no longer giggling secretary and Cliff stand and stare.
Desmond
looks at them.
DESMOND
Who's next?
After a moment of unbearable humiliation they shuffle away.

Stanley and the driver finish loading the body into the van.
Desmond
and Stanley talk.
DESMOND
Take the van back to Portland, Stanley.
I'm going to take one more look at the
trailer park.
They walk towards the van until Stanley stops.
STANLEY
(confidentially)
One thing that has been troubling me.
That lamp at the diner.
Do you think
they were working on it for esthetic
reasons or was their work due to faulty
wiring?
DESMOND
Faulty wiring.
STANLEY
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they,
Agent Desmond?
(extends his hand)
I'm Sam Stanley.
If you ever need me.
DESMOND
Thanks, Sam, for the good work.
You
have a good eye for detail.
STANLEY
We do notice things, don't we, Agent
Desmond?
Are you going back to the
trailer park for the Blue rose?
Desmond smiles at Stanley as they shake.
DESMOND'S POV
As he enters the van, Desmond can barely make out what Stanley says
as he points to the driver.
STANLEY
(very muffled)
83,000 dollars.
33.
THE TRAILER COURT - DAY
Desmond is standing in front of Teresa's trailer with Carl Rodd.
CARL
(motioning behind and to the right
of Teresa's trailer)
And that's Deputy Cliff's trailer over
there.
The red one.
CHET
Right.
CARL
I'll be in my trailer if you need me.
Carl walks away towards his trailer.
Desmond walks over and around
Cliff's red trailer.
He gets a strange feeling.
He looks past
Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a
HAND appear in the window of a trailer.
Then the hand disappears.
Desmond walks to that trailer.
He knocks on the door but no one
answers.
He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_
_a_small_indentation_at_the_top_.
In the indentation is _Teresa_
_Bank's_ring_.
As he reaches out and touches it, _he_disappears_.
34.
CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAY
Carl Rodd shows Cooper to Teresa's trailer.
CARL
GOD.
I'm beginning to lose faith in the
United States Government and that
includes the telephone system.
Don't
you folks talk to one another.
That's her
trailer there and I haven't touched a god
damn thing.
Agent Chet Desmond come
by a second time and asked too see
Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer
(gestures to the red trailer)
...which I showed him.
I went back to
my trailer...
(gestures back to his)
After that I never saw him again.
COOPER
Thank you, Carl.
Cooper starts walking in the opposite direction from Cliff's trailer
picking up on the same odd vibe that struck Desmond.
CARL
(turning back)
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer.
I
told you.
COOPER
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
CARL
Well, where are you going?
COOPER
I am going over here.
CARL
(coming along with him)
God damn, you people are confusing.
Cooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks.
COOPER
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
CARL
A trailer was here.
What the hell do you
think?
COOPER
Can you tell me who's trailer it was...
and who stayed in the trailer?
CARL
An old woman and her grandson.
COOPER
Can you tell me what their names were?
CARL
Chalfont.
Weird.
Chalfont was the
name of the folks that rented the space
before they did.
Two Chalfonts.
Cooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer.
As he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence
of SOMETHING.
Cooper struggles to his feet and looks around.
Under a tree and
close to the tracks is a car.
COOPER
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
CARL
Yep, it sure is.
Cooper walks to it.
AT DESMOND'S CAR
Cooper inspects the car.
Coming around to the front of the car he
notices the windshield.
On the windshield someone has written the
words, "Let's Rock".
38.
WIND RIVER, NEAR DEER MEADOW - AFTERNOON
Cooper stares into the stream.
COOPER
(dictating into his recorder)
Diane, it's 4:20 in the afternoon.
I am
standing here at Wind River where they
found the body of Teresa Banks.
Diane,
this case has got a strange feeling for
me.
Not only has Agent Chester
Desmond disappeared but this is one of
Cole's Blue Rose cases.
The clues that
were found by Agent Desmond and Agent
Stanley have lead to dead ends.
The
letter below the fingernail gives me the
feeling that the killer will strike again.
But like the song says, "...who knows
where or when".

He probably wanted to drive over.
DONNA

Mrs. Tremond and her grandson are standing in the parking lot staring
at Laura.
Mrs. Tremond waves to Laura to come over.
When Laura comes
to them Mrs. Tremond holds out a framed picture.
TREMOND
This would look nice on your wall.
She hands Laura the picture.
It is a picture of a room with flowered
wallpaper and a dark doorway in its corner.
Laura's study of it is
interrupted by the grandson.
GRANDSON
He's looking for a book with pages torn
out.
He's walking towards the hiding
place.
He's moving under the fan now.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Shelly comes out of the Diner with another load of meals.

Shelly, you really can help me.

She watches him cross to his car and drive away.
LAURA

Laura is coming apart, sobbing.
Behind her, on the sidewalk,
a NEIGHBOR has noticed her.
WOMAN
Laura...
A closer look reveals how upset Laura is.
WOMAN
What...
Laura are you all right?
Laura turns away so the woman can't see her crying.
The woman takes
a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass.
LAURA
(trying to hold it together)
I...
lost my necklace...
it must have
fallen.
Laura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace.
She
pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already
around her neck.
LAURA
(clumsily)
Oh, here it is.
Woman moves back to the sidewalk.

Well, I'm glad you found it, darling.

storming out the house with her own very large butcher knife - very
upset with Ed's progress.
NADINE
ED...
ED.
(pushing him away)
I'll take over here.
Ed backs off and Nadine dives in slicing.
NADINE
You were cutting this deer like a

Sit down and watch while I do

CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY
SHERIFF TRUMAN and JOSIE PACKARD break from a kiss.
Smiling, Truman
goes back to gently strumming his guitar.
TRUMAN
Josie, I think we should go public.
JOSIE
That would be wonderful, but it's only
been a year since Andrew died.
TRUMAN
What are you afraid of?
What people
think?
JOSIE
I don't want to offend the customs of
your country.
TRUMAN
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend
the customs of this country.
For
instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
JOSIE
Fish eyes?
TRUMAN
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't
eat a fish eye.
JOSIE
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
TRUMAN
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in
Seattle.
He was digging through his
food with his chopsticks for about five
minutes till he found the fish eye and he
dropped it into his throat.
I guess it
must have gotten stuck in his uvula
because right away he started to have
trouble.
His throat began to flutter
there like there was a wind blowing.
And he couldn't swallow and they rushed
to him and loosened his collar and they
were asking him if he was alright and
he started to turn blue and his eyes
started to roll back into his head and he
still couldn't get the fish eye out and
they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver.
I
went over to him as they were
preparing to do an emergency
tracheotomy.
They were over him with
a knife when he suddenly shot the fish
eye out of his throat and right onto the
ceiling.
Splat!
It just stuck up there
and spread out.
It was about the size of
a half dollar.
And that's why I don't ever
eat fish eyes.
He plays the guitar for Josie.
Then stops.
TRUMAN (continued)
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's
just the way I feel.
It's the custom
thing I was thinking of.
In America we
don't use any part of the fish but the
meat just to the side of the insides.
We
throw away the tail, the rest of the
insides and the head.
JOSIE
I understand.
TRUMAN
We throw away the _whole_ head.

embrace.
Teresa brushes away some hair that has fallen over her face.
As she does this Laura sees the SAME RING.

giggles.

Here he comes.
They both start laughing again.
They see a guy coming through the
woods.
We recognize him as the sullen deputy from Deer Meadow,
Cliff Howard.
BOBBY
(suddenly serious)
Who sent you?
CLIFF
Jacques.
LAURA
That's right.
The deputy takes out a very big bag of coke, showing it to them.

Wow.

Oh, my god, I shot him.
Bobby starts for the dead body.
BOBBY (continued)
Come on, you gotta help me.
With Laura's help they get the body back to the clearing.
They fall
down to their knees, out of breath, staring at what they have done.
Their faces register the shock of having just killed someone.
Laura
looks at Bobby's stunned expression.
LAURA
Look at your face.
A laugh squirts out of Laura.
Bobby turns to her in disbelief.
LAURA (continued)
Bobby, you killed Mike.
Bobby stares at her for a second like Laura has gone insane.
BOBBY
This isn't Mike.
(suddenly unsure - surreal)
Is this Mike?

(frantically to herself)

What do you mean?

You know it and I know it.
JAMES
What is wrong with us?...
We have
everything.
LAURA
Everything, but everything.
JAMES
Oh, Laura.
LAURA
(mimicking him)
"Oh, Laura..."
She gives him a terrible slap.

You always hurt the ones you love.

What are you talking about?
Bobby

LAURA
You want to see...
JAMES
See what?
LAURA
(disgusted)
Right.
Open your eyes, James.
You don't
know me.
Even _Donna_ doesn't know me.
Your Laura disappeared...
It's just me
now.
James grabs her trying to control her.
She twists out of his arms.
LAURA (continued)
How 'bout this, James?
She lifts her hand and gives him the finger.
James ignores the
finger and kisses her, but she's gone ice cold.
LAURA (continued)
I think you want to take me home now,
James.
She leads him back to the bike.
He won't start it.

Oh, quit crying.

fucking caring.

starts to cry.

Laura screams with agony and tries to get off as they approach the
light.
Laura falls off as they skid to a stop.
JAMES
(confused and terrified)
Laura...
Laura crawls back up and puts her hands around James' neck.
LAURA
(from far away she screams)
JAMES, I LOVE YOU.
For a moment she focuses on him.
She looks like the Laura that James
loves.
Innocent and Beautiful.
Laura turns and sees the woods.
It pulls her.
She releases her hold
on James and runs into the waiting darkness.
The red light swings in the wind above James.
It turns green, but he
doesn't move.
When the light turns red again, James guns the engine
