Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation
room into the light of day. They remove their masks and we
see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties.
She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin
and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core
that we will come to realize is off-the-charts. This is
MAYA, a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first
overseas assignment.
DANIEL
(to the guard)
Are we gonna board up these windows
or what?
(TO MAYA)
Just off the plane from Washington,
you're rocking your best suit for
your first interrogation, and then
you get this guy. It's not always
this intense.
MAYA
I'm fine.
She's not.
DANIEL
Just so you know, it's going to take
awhile. He has to learn how helpless
he is. Let's get a coffee.
MAYA
No, we should go back in.
Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes
Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation
room.
DANIEL
You know, there's no shame if you
wanna watch from the monitor.
She shakes her head.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Alright.
At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
You might want to put this on.

MAYA
You're not wearing one. Is he ever
getting out?
DANIEL
Never.

You don't remember, do you? You -
me: same same. Bad memory.
While GUARDS move in the deep b.g., Daniel and Maya are seated
at a picnic table with an appetizing spread of Arabic food.
DANIEL (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
Short term memory loss is a side
effect of sleep deprivation. It
should come back to you.
The Guards bring a prisoner to the table and remove his hood:
Ammar. He stares weakly at the table.
AMMAR
(CAREFULLY)
I don't know. How can I remember?
MAYA
After we kept you awake for 96 hours,
you gave us names of some of your
brothers and saved the lives of a
lot of innocent people.
DANIEL
Which is the smart thing to do, you're
starting to think for yourself.
Ammar is lost. But the food is tempting.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Eat up! You earned it.
Ammar eats.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
So you flew via Amman to Kabul to
hang out with your uncle? Mukhtar.
AMMAR
How did you know that?
DANIEL
I told you man, I know you. Alright,
you got me - flight manifests. It
must've been pretty fucked up for
you guys after 9/11. What did you
do after the invasion and before you
went back to Pesh?
20.
AMMAR
After 9/11 I had to choose: fight,
to protect our turf - or run.
DANIEL
(SYMPATHETIC)
You chose to fight.
Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes.
AMMAR
I wanted to kill Americans. We tried
to get into Tora Bora but the bombing
was too high. We couldn't cross.
MAYA
Sorry, who is the "we" in that
sentence?
AMMAR
Me and some guys who were hanging
around at that time.
DANIEL
(CASUALLY)
I can eat with some other dude and
hook you back up to the ceiling?
AMMAR
Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and
Abu Ahmed.
Maya makes notes on her pad.
MAYA
Who's Abu Ahmed? I've heard of the
other guys.
AMMAR
He was a computer guy with us at the
time. After Tora Bora, I went back
to Pesh - as you know - and he went
North, I think, to Kunar.
MAYA
What's his family name?
AMMAR
Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.
MAYA
Abu Ahmed means "father of Ahmed",
it's a kunya.
(MORE)
21.
MAYA (CONT'D)
Ammar, I know the difference between
a war name and an Arabic name.
DANIEL
She got you there, dude.
AMMAR
I swear to you both: I don't know
his family name. I would have never
asked him something like that. It's
not how my uncle worked. My uncle
told me he worked for bin Laden. I
did see him, once, about a year ago,
in Karachi. He read us all a letter
from the Sheikh.
MAYA
A letter?
DANIEL
What did it say?
Daniel offers Ammar a smoke.
DANIEL (CONT'D)
Cigarette?
Ammar accepts. Daniel's lights it.
AMMAR
It said "Continue the jihad. The
work will go on for a hundred years."

We find Daniel trying to catch a moment of solitude...eating
an ice cream cone and standing in front of a makeshift cage
filled with wild MONKEYS.
The monkeys are watching Daniel intently, their hands gripping
the wire cage. Daniel playfully feeds them some of his ice
cream.
A CIA GUARD approaches Daniel
CIA GUARD

You Agency guys are twisted. The

Daniel nods, weary. Then a monkey reaches through the bars
and steals the remainder of Daniel's ice cream cone.
He looks at the monkey and laughs.

We find Maya entering the gates of a Pakistani prison. The
weather makes the place seem especially bleak.
SUPERIMPOSE: MILITARY DETENTION CENTER - ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN
Pakistani families enjoy a fine summer day.
Faraj's Courier walks past playing children... while from a
nearby tower, Daniel observes.
After a moment, ABU FARAJ, who we recognize from his
photograph, appears at the south end of the park. Faraj
walks in the direction of his courier, noting his
SURROUNDINGS:
CHILDREN playing.
Several people in BLACK BURKHAS.
33.
BRIGHT SUN.
At last Faraj reaches an open area where he can see his
courier face to face.
They exchange a nervous glance that conveys the danger: It's
a trap. Faraj spins to flee, but it's too late.
The black BURKHAS descend on him. It turns out they are
heavily armed Pakistani agents. From on high, Daniel watches
his captured prey.
CUT TO:
Daniel and an armed guard escort a hooded and handcuffed
Faraj to his cell.
DANIEL
What do you like? Bob Marley?
Reggae? Egyptian music? Just let me
know, if there's music you like, I

Maya walks around the facility, quiet at this hour, and finds
another insomniac, Daniel, by the monkey cage. The cage is
empty.
MAYA
Faraj is completely denying knowing
Abu Ahmed, and that's using every
measure we have.
DANIEL
He's either going to withhold or die
from the pressure you're putting on
him.
MAYA
Do you want to take a run at him?
DANIEL
No.
37.
MAYA
No? Since when?
DANIEL
You know, I've been meaning to tell
you: I'm getting outta here.
MAYA
What? You okay?
DANIEL
I'm fine. I've just seen too many
guys naked. It's gotta be over a

do something normal for awhile.
MAYA

DANIEL
Go to Washington, do the dance, see
how that environment works.

You should come with me. Be my number

Maya looks at Dan. No longer the man he once was. She
doesn't hide her disappointment.
MAYA
I'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from
D.C.
They both look at the empty cage, clocking the irony.
DANIEL
They killed my monkeys.
Something about an escape. Can you
fucking believe that?
MAYA
Sorry, Dan.
DANIEL
Look, Maya, you gotta be really
careful with detainees now. The
politics are changing and you don't
want to be the last one holding a

MAYA
I know.

Back in Pakistan, the country has indeed changed to a more
militarized police state, and as we establish the new

The car pulls up to a checkpoint manned by PAKISTANI POLICE.
The Policeman look at the car - look at the plate - the plate
is diplomatic - they walk around the car and stop at the
window - shine their bright light right into Maya's eyes.
A POLICEMAN motions for her to roll down her window.
POLICEMAN
Where are you going?
MAYA
To the Marriott. I assume you noticed
the dip plates.
POLICEMAN
But you have a bag -
The policeman motions to a DUFFEL BAG resting on the rear

MAYA
It's a gym bag.
Maya does not get out of the car. She stares at him
defiantly. He advances forward a bit. She rolls up her
window, flicks the door lock, and starts dialing her cell
phone.
The policeman walks away to rejoin his group. The police
confer. The original policeman returns, this time with
several other cops. They knock on the glass. Hard.
Maya stares straight ahead.

So John?

When he arrives, I'll set the tone,
and then I'll flip it to you - and
you'll talk about asset protection.
JOHN
Roger that.
JESSICA
Then Lauren, I know you want to get
some questions in there - but give
Balawi time after John speaks. We'll
cover the basics and have his birthday

Jessica turns to Zied.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Is that order okay, or do you want

ZIED
I'll introduce you, and you introduce
your team. He knows this is a high

SECURTY GUARD
Quick question: all is taking place
inside our main building?
JESSICA
Right. And Lauren? Washington will
want real time updates so please
stay on top of that. Be concise.
The Director is in the loop. And I
wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't
update the President.
LAUREN
Yeah, I'm on it.
They take in the possibilities.
JESSICA
Now, I just need to get Balawi's ass

Waiting and waiting. No cars approach. The sun beats down.

Several hundred yards before the Camp entrance is a beat-up
SEDAN. The car pulls up to the checkpoint but doesn't

JESSICA

Why are there gate guards there? We
talked about this, no one is supposed
to be there when my source arrives.
You might have spooked him already!
SECURTY GUARD
Procedures only work if we follow
them every time.

JESSICA
This time is different - I'm sorry I
can't explain, but it's for a good
cause.
SECURTY GUARD
Look, I'm responsible for everyone's
safety, okay? It's not just about
you.
JESSICA
I just need them to go away for a
minute. You can search him as soon
as he gets here.
The Security Guard pauses, then into his radio:
SECURTY GUARD
(INTO RADIO)
All stations, go ahead and stand
down.
CHECKPOINT GUARD
(OVER RADIO)
Roger.
The guards move away from their post. The sedan drives past
the gate into a maze of barriers. We follow the car as it
navigates the maze of HESCO barriers, kicking up a cloud of
dust.
Jessica runs back to her team and flashes a thumbs up.
She smiles and pulls out her phone, sending a text.
ECU: PHONE TEXT:
He's here. Brb
MAYA:
Cool!
The car navigates the second set of barriers.
Jessica looks up to see the car approaching and puts the
phone back in her pocket. The sedan is now 50 yards away.
SECURTY GUARD
Okay, he's coming. We're gonna search
him when he gets here.
Everyone prepares. The car gets closer and closer, a driver
in front and a passenger in back.
The sedan pulls to a stop. A BLACKWATER GUARD taps on the
backseat window. Balawi exits on the passenger side. His
free hand is in his pocket.
BLACKWATER GUARD
(to the other guard)
Is he supposed to limp like that?
SECURTY GUARD
Take your hand out of your pocket!
Hey!
BALAWI
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
BLACKWATER GUARD
(raising his M4)
Get you hand out of your pocket!
BALAWI
Allahu Akbar.
Jessica's smile fades
And Balawi detonates a suicide vest hidden under this jacket

You're not gonna like this, he's on

Hakim parks in front of the Rawal Call Center.
Larry drives his team around the narrow streets of Rawalpindi.
In the backseat, the COMPUTER TECH studies his laptop-like
tracking device.
MAYA O.S.
My guess is that he lives close to
where he's making the calls, and it
makes sense he'd be living in
Rawalpindi because there's an Al
Jezerra office there.
Larry is at the wheel, moving slowly through a dangerous
part of town. The streets narrow.
Two motorcycles suddenly pull around in front of Larry's van
and stop. The riders pull out guns.
Hakim gets out of the car and walks toward the men. We can't
hear what they're saying. At last, Hakim comes back to the
car.
Larry's SUV speeds onto a highway, weaving in and out of
dense traffic.
SUPERIMPOSE: PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN
The congestion thickens. They slow to a crawl.
The SUV, stuck in traffic. Can't move.
Larry leaps out of the car and heads into an open air market -
It's packed. All MEN - most with traditional beards worn by
Al Qaeda members - many talking on cell phones.
Impossible to tell who is who. Impossible to find this needle
in a haystack.
CUT TO:
The search continues... Hakim prowls a back alley. Then
goes up on a rooftop to survey the activity below.
Hakim is on a street corner conducting surveillance. We
follow him into a crowd and then lose sight...
We find him again, another street, another fruitless search.
As Hakim goes from street to street, we hear:
JACK O.S.
We got a signal on Tipu Road for ten
minutes. Then he went to Umar Road
for five minutes. Nogaza Road.
Darya Abad. That's in the Umar Road
area. In Rawalpindi: Haider Road,
Roomi Road. He went to the Convoy
Road, which is near the hospital.
So that's Haider, Roomi Road, Said,
No Gaza, Taimur. He made a call
from Haifa Street, that's the spice

No.

Larry scans the street - sees a half dozen guys on cell

TECH (CONT'D)
He's really close.
LARRY
Look at the cars. He's in a vehicle.
Larry spots something:
LARRY (CONT'D)
The guy with the phone in the white
SUV.
They snap a photograph of a WHITE POTAHAR SUV.
LARRY (CONT'D)
Is that him?
TECH
Could be.

LARRY
You got him?
TECH
I got him.
LARRY
I'm breaking off -
The grey minivan pulls away.
CUT TO:
A two lane highway. Tucked on the side of the road is an
OLD MAN with a cart of mangoes.
MAYA (V.O.)
Our current hypothesis is that he
lives somewhere along the highway,
in one of the towns, or a medium
sized city called Abbottabod, or up
near Kashmir.
ECU: mango cart. Nestled among the fruit is a BLACK RADIO.
Squatting in the dirt near a bus stop is another OLD MAN,
watching passengers disembark from a bus.
MAYA (V.O.)
Kashmir is interesting because it's
a way station for the Tribals.
We stay with the old man for a while.
At last, the white POTAHAR SUV drives past. He makes a note
in his pad.

A nut seller, another CIA look out, scoops a handful of nuts
into a bag for a CUSTOMER as he keeps an eye on CARS exiting
the highway.
He takes note as the white POTAHAR passes him.

MAYA (V.O.)
Abbottabod is interesting because we
know from detainee reporting that
Faraj stayed there, briefly in 2003.
CUT TO:
The street is filled with compact cars.
MAYA (V.O.)
The good news is he's driving a white
SUV. SUV's are actually pretty rare
in Pakistan. If he was driving a
sedan or a compact, we'd be fucked.
CUT TO:
The building GUARD sees Maya heading out to her car.
GUARD
Good morning.
MAYA
Good morning, Amad.
Maya gets in her car. The gate opens. As she starts pulling
out onto the street, suddenly a car drives up in front of
her and THREE SHOOTERS come out and hammer Maya's Toyota.
- Maya's guard starts returning fire, but his aim is terrible.
- SHOOTERS bear down on Maya, pumping bullets into her armored
car.

The gate closes, saving her, at the last possible moment.
Hakim paces on a street as the POTAHAR we've been following
drives past him. Hakim watches the vehicle enter a gated
COMPOUND.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
We have explored the possibility of
digging tunnels, of sending hot air
balloons, of re-routing supply C-
130's to take a peek, but that might
be too alerting. We've looked for
ways of collecting available DNA
from his trash - you know, looking
for his toothbrush, but they burn
the trash. We started a vaccination
program, we sent a doctor to the
house, to see if he could pull blood.
A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the
doctor away.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
That didn't work out. We thought
about sending a guy with a bucket to
pull a sample from the sewer to
analyze his fecal matter.
SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR
What was wrong with that, exactly?
He looks up.
GEORGE
What was wrong with that? The sample
would be too diluted.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
And it's asking too much to get a
voice confirmation with him on the
phone?
GEORGE
They don't make telephone calls from
the compound. We pulled the cell
tower nearby.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
And I'm also going to give up hope
that he might ever get in that white
SUV and drive around a bit and we
could see him? Don't they get
groceries.
GEORGE
The unidentified third male does not
get groceries. He does not leave
the compound. He does not present
himself for photographs.
(MORE)
81.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
When he needs fresh air, he paces
around beneath a grape arbor, but
the leaves are so thick they obscure
our satellite views. This is a
professional attempt to avoid
detection - real tradecraft. The
only people we've seen behave this
way are other top level Al Qaeda
operatives.
The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant
who slides a big folder across his desk to George.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
We did a Red Team on your analysis.
According to them, this behavior
could belong to someone other than
Al Qaeda.
DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
They did give a forty percent chance
that the unidentified third man is a
senior Al Qaeda operative. But they
also said there's a thirty-five
percent chance he's a Saudi drug
DEALER
(reading from the
BINDER)
A fifteen percent chance that he's a
Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent
chance that he's one of the relatives
of the brothers.
SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR
Basically, we agree with you, the
house screams security, it screams
someone who wants privacy, it even
screams 'bad guy', but it does not
scream bin Laden.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
You get the point.
(BEAT)
If you can't prove it's bin Laden,
at least prove it's not somebody
else, like a drug dealer.
Beat.
The meeting is adjourned.
As they walk out --
82.
GEORGE
You know we lost our ability to prove
that when we lost the detainee
program.
(BEAT)
Who the hell am I supposed to ask?
Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered
up? He'll just tell his lawyer to
warn bin Laden.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
You'll think of something.

Daniel, Hakim, and of course, Maya. The doors grind open to
reveal: TWO STEALTH BLACKHAWKS
GENERAL
I actually tried to kill this program
a couple of times. They've gone
through an initial round of testing,
and they have excellent radar defeat -
we just haven't tested them with
people in them yet.
The General continues his briefing..
GENERAL (CONT'D)
You'll notice these stealth panels
similar to what we use on the B2 -
(pointing to the rotors)
- The rotors have been muffled with
decibel killers - it's slower than a
Blackhawk and lacks the offense.
But it can hide.
JUSTIN
Excuse me. Can I ask a question?
What do we need this for in Libya?
Gaddafi's anti-air is virtually non-
existent.
Maya looks over, not sure what to say.
GEORGE
Gentlemen, can I have your attention?
My name is George. I run the Af-Pak
division at CTC, and I'm primary on
this for the agency. This is a title
fifty operation.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
Some of us have worked together
before. This is a good one. Maya,
do you want to brief them?
Maya looks at the SEALs. Folds her arms. This isn't going
to be easy.
MAYA
There are two narratives about the
location of Osama bin Laden.
This registers on the SEALs.
MAYA (CONT'D)
The one that you're most familiar
with is that UBL is hiding in a cave
in the Tribal Areas, that he's
surrounded by a large contingent of
loyal fighters.
Beat.
MAYA (CONT'D)
But that narrative is pre- 9/11
understanding of UBL.
The second narrative is that he's
living in a city - living in a city
with multiple points of egress and
entries and with access to
communications so that he can keep
in touch with the organization. You
can't run a global network of inter-
connected cells from a cave.
Beat.
MAYA (CONT'D)
We've located an individual we believe
based on detainee reporting is bin
Laden's courier. He's living in a
house in Abbottabod, Pakistan. And
we assess that one of the other
occupants of the house is UBL.
JUSTIN
Excuse me. You got an intel source
on the ground?
MAYA
No.
86.
JUSTIN
No? Okay, so how do you know it's
bin Laden? We've been on this op
before, you know.
MAYA
Bin Laden uses a courier to interact
with the outside world. By locating
the courier, we've located bin Laden.
PATRICK
That's really the intel? That's it?
MAYA
Quite frankly, I didn't even want to
use you guys, with your dip and your
velcro and all your gear bullshit.
I wanted to drop a bomb but people
didn't believe in this lead enough
to drop a bomb, so they're using you
guys as canaries on the theory that
if bin Laden isn't there, you can
sneak away and no one will be the
wiser.

But bin Laden is there - and you're
going to kill him for me.

JUSTIN (CONT'D)
If her confidence is the one thing
that's keeping me from getting ass-
raped in a Pakistani prison...I don't
know. I'm gonna be honest with you
though, I guess I'm cool with it.
91.
They bump fists, laughing. Maya's cell phone rings. She
moves aside to answer it.
We INTERCUT with George in his Langley office.
GEORGE
Maya, I wanted you to hear it first.
You know that thing we talked about?
It's going to happen.
MAYA
When?
GEORGE
Tonight. Good luck.
She hangs up, turns back to the SEALs, who are still playing
horseshoes with the grace of young guys in their prime.
Their lives are in her hands.
CUT TO:
MAYA
Thank you for coming with me.
HAKIM
Of course. I'll go with you where
ever you want.
A few hundred feet in front of them they can see SEALs
preparing their gear.
MAYA
Fuck Hakim, what if I'm wrong?
(MORE)
92.
MAYA (CONT'D)
I wish we could have just dropped a
bomb.
HAKIM
Please don't drop it while we're in
the house.
MAYA
I'm serious.
HAKIM
Me too. Don't drop anything while
I'm inside.
Off her anxious smile --
CUT TO:
LZ - NIGHT
Blinding white lights - rigged to chain link fencing, like a
space shuttle launch -
Silhouetted shapes behind the lights and the thump-thump-
thump SOUND of high-dollar helicopters -
Now push through the glare and the fence into -
LZ
A top-secret LZ.
Where twenty-two SEALs in full battle rattle and an attack
DOG load into TWO STEALTH BLACKHAWK helicopters
Moving fast, wordlessly, loading weapons and gear - under
the intense bright white light, then -
- Doors slam, engines whine -
Fifty yards away, Maya stands alone, looking on.
- And the HELOS rise above the lights and disappear into the
night.
Flying in formation, barely visible in the moonless sky, no
flying lights.
The helos near the Tora Bora mountain range: dimly visible
bulks rising in front of the helos.
The stealths take a sharp turn. Skimming the mountain.
PATRICK
Who here's been in a helo crash
before?
Everyone raises their hands.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Okay, so we're all good.
CUT TO:
94.
Find the HELICOPTERS navigating tight mountain passes. NOTE:
Throughout the flying sequence that follows the helicopters
fly very close to the ground, with a margin of error less
then twenty feet.
CUT TO:
PILOT POV:
The terrain zooms by as we travel through a twisty mountain
PASS -
- Looming straight ahead on a collision course is a GIANT
MOUNTAIN. They zoom closer. We can see individual rocks now -
Seconds before impact, the HELICOPTERS bank into a hard left
turn.
DUST blows off the mountain.
CUT TO:
Outside: Darkness....just a THUMP THUMP THUMP...
And then we see them: flying in tight formation, the oddly
rectangular helos, with their black stealth panels and sharp
edges, like two alien spaceships advancing.
PILOT
(OVER INTERCOM)
Should be coming up just off our
nose, 3 o'clock.
Everyone grabs onto their gear, getting ready to fast rope.
DOOR
Patrick flings open the side door. Night wind rushes in -
Small cottages mixed in with larger suburban homes. Among
them, swimming pools. The water shimmering. Surreal. Then:
rows of green fields. A stand of trees.
It appears: AC 1. It is massive - six or seven times larger
than any other nearby structure - with sixteen foot high
walls and a gated interior. A fortress.
96.
The helos circle the COMPOUND, kicking up dust, and begin to
descend.
Cross cutting all that follows:
- At thirty feet above the ground the helicopter begins to
shudder and lose stability. Instead of descending in a
straight path, the bird drifts sideways
PATRICK
(shouting to pilot)
Hey! Slide right.
- Then lurches down, falling to within 15 feet of the swirling
ground, rotors churning the dust, creating near BROWNOUT
conditions, a dust hurricane
ECU: rear rotor blades edging closer to the wall, inch by
inch.
-- Engines straining LOUDLY in the thin, hot air
-- The bird loses control, SPINS to a hard landing
-- TAIL crashes hard on the WALL, in a awful screech of
twisting metal and sheared concrete -
97.
The dust settles to reveal...a twisted wreck.
PRINCE 51 has crash landed into a precarious position, with
the back half of the helicopter wedged into the top of the
wall and the front of it in the ground, leaving the passengers
inside suspended more then ten feet off the ground.
Although he's wearing a heavy pack and carrying gear, Patrick
jumps down, landing with a knee-shattering combat roll.
Several SEALs follow him.
Patrick pulls out of his roll and turns around to face the
house, looming ominously ahead of him.
The second helo passes over but a storm of debris and garbage
from the rooftop creates another flight risk and the helo
banks away.
CUT TO:
98.
Patrick, Justin and SIX other SEALs cluster near the First
Gate in the animal pen. One of the SEALs places a charge on
the gate, while others check the Prayer Room.
Boom! The charge partially blows open the metal swing doors
of the gate, leaving a very narrow gap. Not ideal. The
SEALs muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening
in the jagged metal as the SNIPER climbs up on the roof of
the prayer room.
Patrick and Jared arrive at the guest house but can't see
inside - the windows and doors are covered with sheets.
Patrick kneels down to place a charge at the front door handle
when the door erupts with gunfire
- Bullets fly out of the wooden door. One skims Patrick's
shoulder as he kneels lower. Patrick fires back at the house,
putting a dozen rounds inside.
A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle
unlocks. ABU AHMED'S WIFE appears at the doorway and walks
out.
JARED
Ir-fah ee-dek!
ABU AHMED'S WIFE
(IN ENGLISH)
You killed him.
The rest of the P51 SEALS breach a gate to the courtyard of
the Main House. The gate flies open in a fiery ball.
CUT TO:
99.
SEALs jump out of P52, rush to the outer wall and set
breaching charges on a gate... While Hakim, the DOG HANDLER,
and another SEAL peel off down the block
Saber and his team stand by as BOOM!!!, The gate charges go
off...only to reveal a BRICK WALL behind the gate.
SABER
That's not a door.
SEAL
Failed breach.
They hustle to the next entry way and prepare another breach
CUT TO:
The COMMANDING OFFICER hears that the SEALs outside are
preparing a charge. SEAL MIKE radios in
SEAL MIKE (O.S.)
(INTO RADIO)
This is Echo 11, we're going to breach
the main gate.
COMMANDING OFFICER
(INTO RADIO)
Negative. I'm internal, I'll let
you in.
The Commanding Officer opens the gate and the other SEALs
walk inside. As a group, they move towards the main house,
arriving at the South side front door. The door is open and
they enter -
In the regrouping that occurs on the side of the main house,
Justin and Patrick find themselves side by side - and the
old friends take a moment to reconnect while the rest of the
team places charges and prepares for the next phase of the
assault.
PATRICK
(QUIETLY)
You good?
JUSTIN
Yeah. I forgot...were we supposed
to crash that helo?
Patrick allows himself a smile.
PATRICK
Ibrahim tried to shoot me through
the door. I popped him from the
outside.
JUSTIN
I fucking smoked Abrar and his wife.
(SHIFTING TONE)
(alt: I think she was
PREGNANT)
PATRICK
Still alive?
JUSTIN
She's gonna bleed out.
PATRICK
What a fuckin' mess -
The door blows - and they keep moving -
102.
- Boooom!
-- The door FLIES like a missile right into where Jared had
been standing.
JARED
(TO JUSTIN)
Thanks.
JUSTIN
Yeah.
CUT TO:
The neighborhood, awakened by the crash and gunfire, stirs
to life. Hakim and the SEALs notice LIGHTS flipping on.
And down the block, a group of several young men appear on a
roof.
SEAL
(raising his weapon)
This is Echo 05, I've got unknowns
gathering on the Southwest Rooftops.
Hakim, move those guys back.
HAKIM
(speaking in Pashto)
Go back brothers, this is official
government business, and there is
nothing to see here!!
SEAL
I'm going to start wasting them.
HAKIM
Please! They will kill you!
The onlookers pause. SEAL aiming lasers dance across their
chests.
HAKIM (CONT'D)
They will kill you!
They turn and go.
104.
The Commanding Officer issues orders.
106.
COMMANDING OFFICER
(INTO RADIO)
All Stations: target secure, target
secure.
The COMMANDING OFFICER is talking on two radios at once -
one to his men, the other to brass back at Jalalabad base.
COMMANDING OFFICER
(INTO RADIO)
Echo 05, this is Red 02, how long do
you need for SSE?
COMMANDING OFFICER
(INTO RADIO)
You have four.
COMMANDING OFFICER
(INTO RADIO)
If you're not at the LZ in four, I'm
going to leave your ass behind.
Hakim arrives at the crashed helo. He crawls into the
interior and finds a BLACK BODY BAG. We follow this bag:
The body bag is laid in the courtyard.
The EOD SEAL slides into the belly of Prince 51. While he
places charges, another SEAL climbs up to affix charges to
the roof and rotors ...and like a tight roper, he walks out
on the tail of the helicopter, when suddenly his foot slips,
piercing the tail's thin skin, and he nearly falls off.
He manages to place a last charge - but the remainder of the
tail piece will not be detonated.
109.
Back at the whirling helicopter, the SEALs shove the BODY
BAG into the interior compartment and jump in after it.
The helo rises into the night.
CUT TO:
PRINCE 51 explodes, sending shrapnel and a fireball high
into the air
The SEALs watch the flames as the compound shrinks beneath
THEM
The fire of the exploded crashed helo blazes in the night.
Bathed in the bright white lights, Maya waits for the helo.
Concern on her face.
At last, she hears it.
A moment later, PRINCE 52 hovers into view and lands. Patrick
and several SEALs run out, carrying the bag...
Maya makes her way towards the hangar tent.
Maya waits on the tarmac, alone.
A C-17, one of the largest most impressive planes in the
American fleet, rolls to a stop and the hatch opens.
She climbs the ladder -
