There's not an empty inch inside the little vehicle or
on top.
The passengers are silent. A woman breast feeds
a baby.
Several passengers fan themselves. Many sleep.
The Pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat.
MANOOJ
(to his neighbor)
Our farm has died, so we are
moving to Calcutta to become rich!
Hasari and Aloka look
at each other: If only it were the
pursuit of wealth and
not survival. The woman under-
stands. And now the
BUS GRINDS forward and the Pals look
back. Hasari coughs,
suppresses it... as silence falls.
The elder Pals stand huddled
together in the dust and we
see, nestled behind a boulder
at the roadside, a tiny,
blue flower -- beautiful and
fragile, but like all things
alive, determined to live...
and we hear the sound of a
DOZEN VOICES CHANTING a quiet
mantra in unison as we --
DISSOLVE TO:
This flower floats gently in a bowl of water. The TITLES
END as we PULL BACK SLOWLY to reveal a dozen Anglos,
several Indians, and one Kenyan seated cross-legged
before an aging Yogi, who's quietly urging the suppli-
cants to find "their light, allow your white light to
fill your spirit's eye." Above, ceiling fans move the
air.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
As we PAN the group, we see that everyone has his/her
eyes closed in earnest meditation... until we COME TO an
American, MAX LOEB, 29, who pops open first his right eye
-- looks to his right and left -- closes his right eye
and opens his left eye -- looks left and right... and
then, instead of continuing the mantra and the search for
his white light, expels a stream of air through his
pursed lips, making a vibrating, flatulent sound, one
indicative of sizeable frustration and dismissal.
MAX
Get serious.
Around him, other single eyes pop open, searching for the
source of this unmeditative sound. Max nods and smiles
a wry smile as if to say: This just ain't doin' it for
me, folks.
Max closes the trumpet case and starts chucking his
clothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise. We
notice the Hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around his
neck. His girl friend, BETSY KAHN, overdressed somewhat
in an Indian style, endeavors to exercise the inner peace
she's been pursuing...
BETSY
I swear to God, you never give
anything enough time! What did
you expect in five days, Max?
MAX
Only what
they promise in the
brochure:
Inner peace, serenity,
and a nice
chant that gets rid of
this rock
in my gut. E.S.T., they
do you in
a weekend.
BETSY
I would really appreciate it if
you wouldn't be terribly glib just
now, Max.
That's okay with Max, who's willing to eschew communica-
tion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff in
the valise.
BETSY
Am I to assume you'll be at the
airport in Calcutta a week from
tomorrow?
(CONTINUED)
4.
CONTINUED:
MAX
Impossible to predict, Betsy Ilene
Kahn. Maybe you better give me my
ticket.
BETSY
Screw you, Max -- I paid for it!
How many times am I going to let
you walk out on me and come back?
MAX
I think only you can answer that,
Betsy Ilene Kahn.
She slaps him.
MAX
Do you really think that's an
appropriate way to get rid of your
Western rage, Bets?
She swings at him again.
He catches her hand hard in his
fist.
MAX
One slap is romantic. Two would
call for retaliation... Lend me a
hundred dollars.
She yanks free, begins to chant her mantra as he grabs
his knapsack and valise and goes out the door.
Now,
she's silent and, in the simplest sense, deeply hurt.
She can't help herself; she cares. We STAY WITH
her
a moment as we --
DISSOLVE TO:
A small service desk. A CLERK, who doubles as Ground
Control on the microphone, passing on the prevailing wind
and the active runway. We hear the STATIC-BACKED VOICE
of a PILOT, giving his call numbers, then announcing
he's clear for immediate takeoff on the active runway.
The Clerk CLICKS off and finds Max.
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
MAX
How you doin'?
The Clerk gives Max a warm smile.
CLERK
Hello.
MAX
I've always wanted to walk into a
little airport just about like
this one and ask the guy at the
counter the following question.
Ready?
The Clerk nods; he's at Max's ervice.
MAX
When's the next flight to anywhere?
CLERK
To Bombay. Tomorrow, at one
o'clock in the afternoon.
A beat --- the Clerk with his smile, Max with his, one
simply warm, the other giving off simmering heat.
Max is crammed into the back seat with the plump Ravi.
ANOTHER ANGLE
We see now that, contrary to our assumption that Veejay
would be in the left seat, it's Manubai who's flying the
plane. The NOISE of the ENGINE forces them to speak
somewhat loudly.
VEEJAY
We were among the fortunate back
in '48.
We got out of East Bengal
before partition destroyed so many.
We make mattresses. The Rajah
Double Spring.
Veejay has an old flask out.
VEEJAY
We don't have a flight attendant
on this flight...
(passing the flask)
Are you a musician, Mr. Loeb?
MAX
Unattached trumpet player and
recently-certified associate guru.
As he takes a hit
on
the flask, Max's eye focuses on the
little mirror on
the
dash. In it he can see Manubai's
eyes. If we
were
to
judge by what he sees in them, she
doesn't find him
the
least bit amusing. He smiles his
smile at her.
Gangooly enters, glances around, waves the Pals in.
They're amazed. There's a cage occupied by two parrots.
In one corner, a small altar dedicated to the goddess
Lakshmi is decorated with some flowers and, behind a
torn, plastic curtain in a corner, part kitchen, part
wash place, containing a tap with running water.
GANGOOLY
Be free -- look around.
On the faces of the family is one thought: Is it
possible? Amrita goes right to the parrots.
GANGOOLY
They'll need feeding. Give them
seed. But don't spoil them.
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
He bows briefly before the altar as he moves to the
washing area.
GANGOOLY
And now, one of the miracles of
life in the city. One and two...
He turns on the tap and a stream of brown WATER GURGLES
out. The Pals are hypnotized, the fists around their
hearts begin to ease.
GANGOOLY
Holy water from the Ganges! Flows
out forever. Come -- touch it.
Manooj and Shambu put their hands under the tap.
GANGOOLY
Drink! It's as pure as the dew on
Shiva's lips.
They drink. Gangooly claps in delight... and beckons
Hasari aside.
FAVORING GANGOOLY AND HASARI
GANGOOLY
Now, this place is yours for two
weeks. My cousin, Moti, is away,
traveling. Normally, the rent
takes fifty rupees for a week, but
for a brother, forty. No, don't
thank me.
Hasari pulls out his little screw of money.
HASARI
I have only seventy-five, but as
soon as I have work...
GANGOOLY
Give me the fifty, pay the rest
next week. You'll find work, I
trust you. Aren't I from Bihar,
too?
Yes.
And the money is in his hand.
He joins his hands
together.
GANGOOLY
You are pleased? Then Mr. Gangooly
is pleased. It's how I am.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
He turns on his heel and he's gone. For a moment, the
Pals are still, swept from the brink of catastrophe to
salvation... and now, as one, they release their sheer
and utter joy.
Ravi and Veejay leading Max up the grand staircase,
Manubai in the foyer, looking after them.
Ravi leads the way into a lovely guest bedroom.
RAVI
I hope this is all right. The
room hasn't been aired or the bed
turned, but --
VEEJAY
Oh, he doesn't care about that, do
you, Max? Here, look here.
Veejay opens a little cupboard, stocked with liquor.
VEEJAY
Help yourself. Be comfortable.
Ravi, come on, go, go, let's leave
the young man to himself.
Obediently, Ravi goes.
Veejay follows.
Max goes to the
window.
HIS POV
The beautiful Manubai in the garden.
MAX
He lies down on the bed.
He's found Nirvana.
It's Hasari who watches now. There's LAUGHTER from Aloka
and Amrita. Joyful SHOUTS from the boys. Hasari is
alone in the main room, on his knees, in front of the
pile of their baggage and bundles. He turns his atten-
tion from the laughter to a just-opened, old suitcase.
He takes out a small tea box. Opens it delicately.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
It's full of something brown. He
pushes his fingers in
and feels this bit of earth with a tenderness that's
almost religious, puts a pinch to his nose and breathes
it in. The LAUGHTER and SHOUTING
from the bathing area
is GROWING.
Shambu is paddling near the tap. Aloka is bending over
the drain and Amrita is rinsing her heavy, dark hair
with a pot. Manooj is nearby, rubbing himself with an
old towel. Hasari enters unnoticed and looks at the
group with tenderness... and with gratitude for their
good fortune.
A MAN, red with anger, yanks the curtain aside, stares.
The family freezes. Aloka's hair drips unnoticed on her
sari.
MAN
What are you doing here?
Who are
you?
HASARI
My name is Pal, Hasari. Mr.
Gangooly rented this space to --
MAN
Mr. Who?
HASARI
Gangooly.
You must be his cousin,
Mr. Moti.
MAN
I don't know any Gangooly and my
name is Binal and this is my home
-- get out!
The furious Binal, followed by the Pals, goes into the
main part of the room. A small crowd has been attracted
by the noise.
HASARI
But this is true. We paid him a
deposit of fifty --
BINAL
A man goes out because he has to
work, and some beggar tries to
move in while his back is turned.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
This while Binal has begun to throw things out onto the
street, though this cleansing of his home doesn't stop
him from picking up a stick. The odd sympathizer meets
with...
BINAL
So, should I suffer if they are
so stupid to jump into the first
mouth that wants to eat them?
He turns with the stick on Hasari.
BINAL
You're lucky I don't kill you!
Hasari looks at Manooj, who drops his eyes. They collect
the remainder of their possessions and hurry out the
door.
Moving through the dark, a figure, touching things,
looking at photographs of the Chattergees. We hear
a MUFFLED DIALOGUE mixed with the SINGING a la Dean
Martin of "Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime":
"Goddamn it, boy, what's the matter with you? --
"Everybody loves somebody sometime" -- "Go for it,
son!" -- "Sure, Dad, whatever you say, Dad." --
"Everybody falls in love somehow" -- "You're the dad,
Dad." Now, a humidor. Max opens it, takes out a
cigar, takes two. Takes five. Senses someone. Turns.
14.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Ravi in her bathrobe.
MAX
I'm starving.
He gives her his best saint's smile.
RAVI
Well, you don't want to eat those
awful cigars. Come with me, we'll
wake up the cook, she'll fix you
something proper.
In the moving mirror we see counters and shelves of men's
clothing.
The mirror stops at Max slipping into a kurta before an
audience of Ravi, Manubai, and a salesman.
RAVI
It's not extravagant at all. You
can't go around all week in your
tribal garb.
Max sees a boy's face pressed to the glass: he indicates
the shirt, for the boy's approval. The boy smiles a
wonderful smile.
RAVI
Now he looks civilized, doesn't
he, Manubai?
MANUBAI
Almost.
Max looks at her.
She at him.
16.
A flaking gray wall, half-obscured with moldering files.
The grilled window lets in a little light and the quiet
supplications of those outside.
An old CLERK at a desk. A voice calls out.
The Clerk
looks up, crosses to the grill.
Hasari's tense face through the bars. A TRUCK RUMBLES
past, drowning out the words... except these: "...trade
union." The Clerk shakes his head sadly. On the verge
of panic, Hasari hangs onto the window...
CLERK
Do you have family?
HASARI
Yes, yes of course. But I'm
three days without work. I'll
take anything.
The Clerk digs in his pocket, presses two rupees on
Hasari.
CLERK
Here, now go away.
HASARI
No, I don't want you to give me --
The next man in line forcibly moves Hasari out of the
way.
CLERK
In this city, a man with a family
can't be proud. Take it!
The Clerk waves him away, turns his attention to the
next man.
Manubai's face.
Then Max's.
Then hers.
Then his.
Looking at each other.
Five days.
Kiss.
Ravi.
MAX
I said you have three days to
get me into bed, and I'm betting
you can't do it.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
MANUBAI
It's all right for you to use my
mother as your tour guide and
meal ticket, because she'll get
something nice out of it. But
what would I get?
He stares at her a moment, then gets up, goes around the
table.
MAX
Well, gee,
I don't know. Maybe I
could say
something so amusing
that you'd
laugh so hard it would
break that
hot poker you have up
your ass.
She stares at him. He bends to kiss her. She doesn't
pull away... but after a moment he realizes she isn't
responding. He continues the kiss, but he opens his
eyes... to find her staring at him. He pulls back.
They stare at each other another moment, then Max
senses someone in the doorway.
RAVI
Staring at them, disappointment filling her eyes.
MAX
The same sound of frustration and ennui he made in the
ashram.
The room is utterly utilitarian. The Porter turns on a
ceiling fan, sending an army of cockroaches scurrying
for calmer terrain. Max clearly doesn't care for
cockroaches.
PORTER
It pleases you?
MAX
No fruit basket? No mini bar?
Max hands the Porter several rupees.
PORTER
Bar? Of course -- many, many.
But make care, Sahib. Please,
for me. If it is lady you like
to know -- yes? -- you let me.
Huh? Very sweet girl, good
nature, very sweet. Or boy, very
good...
Max puts a finger on the Porter's head, turns him for
the door.
PORTER
No like boy? Something then for
smoke -- mmmh, very good for smoke!
AT DOOR
Max eases the Porter out.
As the door is closing...
PORTER
Maybe you like two girls -- look
a little Chinese, but very great
pleasure.
Max smiles his smile and disappears the Porter behind the
closed door. The smile disappears and the FAN gets his
attention; it has an annoying rhythm and sound. He
flicks the switch, but the fan continues to snap around.
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
He stares at it... and startles us by suddenly flicking
out a hand and grabbing the blade, stopping the fan.
He lets go. The fan is still. He carries his knapsack
to the tub; it has brown stains along the middle and
the water has a brown tinge as it flows out of the tap.
He sits on the edge of the tub, dumps his knapsack on
the floor, picks up a half-dozen pamphlets from the
ashram.
CLOSE ON PAMPHLETS
Guides to inner peace.
RESUME
He wings the pamphlets at the trashcan.
Max sits on the floor in a corner and plays as we hear
the sound of a fierce WHISTLE and a SCREAMING ENGINE.
A needle injected, blood flowing into a bottle.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Hasari seated on a stool, watching his blood leave his
body, his face broken out in perspiration.
HASARI
I thought you were only taking a
little.
ATTENDANT
We pay more, we take more.
HASARI
I'm feeling a little dizzy.
ATTENDANT
It'll pass.
HIS POV
Rafik and a thin man chatting easily and exchanging ciga-
rettes with another attendant. His vision BLURS.
HASARI AND NURSE
With his free hand, he begins to grapple for the Atten-
dant to keep his balance, starts to fall... and the
SCREEN GOES BLACK.
FADE IN:
Max lies on his messed bed, contorted, with his feet up
over his head against the wall. A book lies open beside
him. A half-eaten room service meal, many hours old,
moulders on the bedside table. Max is babbling a mock
sports case into his fist...
MAX
They're in the shotgun. There's
the snap from center, the clock is
running -- five, four, three -- he
has an open man at the Notre Dame
twenty for the victory... and he
freezes. He freezes! Mr. Choke
chokes. The fans go --
A KNOCK at the door. Max shuts up, falls off the wall.
He crosses to the door. Opens it. POOMINA is 16,
beautiful and exotic-looking behind her excessive makeup.
ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING MAX
The porter pushes the girl gently into the room, smiling
at Max, nodding. The door is closed.
27.
MAX AND POOMINA
He may have been receptive to a "sweet, young girl," but
not a kid in her teens.
MAX
Got an I.D. on you?
(she doesn't get it)
How old are you?
POOMINA
Twenty, sahib.
MAX
I buy that.
She approaches him seductively.
POOMINA
I can do anything you want, sahib.
She fingers the
Hebrew letter at Max's throat, on its
gold chain. For
a moment, Max is mesmerized by this
child; but then,
as she begins more serious ministra-
tions, he pulls
back.
MAX
Hold it, time out. Time, there's
time out on the field.
POOMINA
Is problems, sahib?
MAX
Is problems, yeah, just a couple.
POOMINA
No, please, yes, I can --
There's something desperate in her that makes him put a
finger to her lips and say...
MAX
How 'bout some chow?
(she doesn't get it)
I was just about to order some room
service. Food. I call, they come,
we eat.
She stares at him.
Max smokes a Monte
Cristo and watches Poomina, like a
frightened little
animal, devour the last of a Green
Acres room service
meal and then wrap a small piece of
fish in the paper
napkin.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
She looks up at him, delivers a small burp.
Covers her
mouth in charming embarrassment.
POOMINA
Now, you are ready for great
pleasure, yes?
MAX
Watching you eat was my great
pleasure. Now you go home.
As he escorts her toward the door, Poomina is distressed.
Max realizes she can't leave empty-handed. He pulls out
some notes.
MAX
For you.
She hasn't given up, though, and as he takes the money,
she stands on tiptoe and kisses him. Torn, Max begins
to respond. He stops
himself, his grip on her causing
her discomfort. His
breath comes in little bursts.
MAX
You're a very wet kisser. Work on
it, get in touch in five years.
He leads her toward the door. Like some lunatic comedy.
she resists. He pushes. She locks her knees. He opens
the door.
MAX
Goddamn it, cut it out!
Now, good
night.
He muscles her out the
door, closes it, wipes his lips.
He stares at a parade
of cockroaches gliding along the
wall as he listens to
her CRYING quietly on the other
side of the door. He
debates... and he loses. Opens the
door. Poomina stands
there; the tears stop and a lip-
twitching smile lights
her face.
MAX
Five years already? Gee, time
really flies when you have no
moral conviction.
She slides into his arms, pressing against him. With his
shoulder, he closes the door, leaving us outside.
A bare light bulb; a SCRATCHY vinyl RECORD on a turn-
table.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
Poomina watches Max do a sleight-of-hand trick with a
coin. He tosses it up, brings his hands past each other,
then holds out his fists; she picks on... but the other
holds the penny. Fooled, she laughs. He does it again;
she points to one fist -- empty -- then other -- also
empty. Max reaches behind her ear and... produces the
coin. She loves it, her laughter escalating. But then
she seesm to read something in the b.g. where we see four
thugs, two of whom will become known to us as THE GOONDA,
a capo to the local "mafia" chieftan, and ASHOKA, son of
the local Godfather. Ashoka works on a pimple on his
chin. The Goonda meticulously cleans a spot of mud with
spit from one of his expensive new running shoes. Max
eyes the thugs eyeing him.
MAX
Short guys!
Quit lookin' at us!
This remark goes over big with the thugs. Max doesn't
care. He knocks off the last of the beer in his bottle.
The bartender brings them two shots of something in two
unmatched glasses.
POOMINA
Special drink for you, sahib.
Only the most man can drink it.
You make try. For me.
MAX
For you, I would drink battery
acid.
POOMINA
Who that finish first.
I bet!
She puts her glass to her lips and, in a childish,
exaggerated way, mimes waiting for him to commence a
drinking race with her. The two of them toss off what's
in their glasses. The bangla in Max's glass is stronger
than battery acid. He does an elaborate routine involv-
ing the pain, the surprise, the sheer awfulness of the
drink. But puts it down with mock machismo.
POOMINA
I beat!
MAX
I really don't think so -- oh no,
nay, nay! I never lose the truly
irrelevant contest.
POOMINA
We have fun some more.
I bet
again!
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:
She turns to the bartender, calls for two more. All the
while, in the b.g., The Goonda and his two thugs watch
emotionlessly and Ashoka works on his acne.
- DAY
The crucifix sways. Now Max's eyes RACK FOCUS TO the
cherubic face of JOAN BETHAL, peering AT the CAMERA
without sympathy.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Max on a cot in a tiny, spare room, a butterfly bandage
under one eye. Joan, Irish, short, stout, hovers over
him. Behind her, Hasari Pal.
JOAN
Good morning, junior, welcome to
our country.
Max manages to sit up.
Wishes he hadn't.
MAX
Oh, I like the way the room moves
in circles.
(checking out his
accommodations)
I suppose I should inquire where I
am.
JOAN
You're in the City of Joy.
MAX
Is that geographic or spiritual?
JOAN
Oh, now we require that each
visitor decide that for himself.
This gentleman and a young lady
brought you here.
MAX
Did I do that to your nose?
(as Hasari nods)
I'm sorry.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
Hasari shrugs, smiles... and a gigantic rat drops in
Max's lap. He leaps to his feet and against the wall.
The rat scurries away.
MAX
What was that -- a Shetland pony?
JOAN
I would have to inspect it more
closely, but I believe that was
one of our economy-size rats.
Max clambers for the door.
Too late, Joan thinks to
say...
JOAN
Watch your --
Max cracks his head on the door frame.
MAX
Thanks -- got it.
He ducks outside for some air.
At first all we see are feet on a marble floor. The
Goonda's in his running shoes, then Ram and Hasari's
bare feet.
This is the partitioned splendor of an old house
sprinkled with the relics of a grand colonial past.
Everything is baroque, rotting and somehow impressive.
Hasari has never been anywhere like this, and is caught
between curiosity and fear of breathing.
The three men enter a large room shuttered from the sun-
light -- dusty and packed with a ramshackle assortment
of furniture. Two fat blue titmice perch in a cage next
to ambitious plaster portrait of Napolean.
Sitting behind a desk is Ashoka, leaning over a mirror,
squeezing a balky pimple.
Near a large window, his 60-year-old father, GHATAK, in
a European jacket and dhoti, works with intense concen-
tration at repairing a pair of broken glasses with a
twist of fine wire.
The three new arrivals stand silent and respectful
before the desk. At last, without raising his head...
ASHOKA
Not a tongue between you then?
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
RAM
Yes, yes, I am wondering, sir,
we are, is it possible you might
have something for my friend?
Ram indicates Hasari, as if there might be some question
to whom he's referring. Ashoka attacks the pimple.
RAM
Let me explain it for your ears,
sir. My cousin from Bihar has
just arrived in our city --
GOONDA
They've brought a small present
-- of respect.
The Goonda places a small bundle of rupees on the desk.
Ashoka allows himself a disinterested glance at
Hasari.
ASHOKA
So, you want to be a human horse?
RAM
Oh yes! I have personally witnessed
his excellence -- yes.
ASHOKA
He doesn't talk? Can he neigh at
least?
(to Hasari)
You -- do your ears function?
HASARI
Oh yes, Babu.
Can I... uhm...?
ASHOKA
Neigh!
Like a horse.
Ashoka pulls back his lips, shows his teeth and imitates
a neigh: "Ne-igh! Ne-igh!"
HASARI
Well, yes, Babu, I can do that.
Would you like me to imitate a
horse?
Finished with the pimple, Ashoka wipes a finger on his
shirt and takes a helping off a plate of sweetcakes
as...
38.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Behind him, The Godfather walks up to the desk, putting
his glasses on. He barely glances at his son, but
waves him out of the chair.
Ashoka doesn't like it, but he steps aside. As he does,
he turns a look of hatred on Hasari. Through no fault of
his own, Hasari has made an enemy. Ghatak chews on a pan
and casts a benevolent eye on Hasari.
GHATAK
Lift your longhi.
Hasari does.
The Godfather looks at his legs and thighs.
GHATAK
The wise men of our nation say that
nirvana is the attainment of a
state of supreme detachment. For
me, nirvana is counting each
evening, one by one, the rupees
earned by my two thousand and
forty-six rickshaws.
Hasari doesn't know whether to respond. A glance at
Ram tells him not to. Ghatak gestures for Hasari to
lower his longhi.
GHATAK
You are with family?
HASARI
I have a wife and three children,
Babu.
GHATAK
And they must eat, heh. The
world is full of open mouths.
He chews on this a moment, then opens a drawer... and
holds a small, tinkling rickshaw bell toward Hasari.
Hasari understands that, incredibly, he has a job. His
breath is so shallow, he can barely utter his gratitude.
He takes the bell.
HASARI
I shall be eternally grateful to
you. From now on, I shall be as
the youngest of your brothers.
GHATAK
Stay loyal. These days, it's a
crop nobody plants.
The Godfather turns his beatific and Godlike smile on
Hasari Pal.
(CONTINUED)
39.
A door opens. Moonlight. Faces peer through the door.
Ram lights an oil lamp. In the glow, the family looks
around their tiny space. Hardly able to suppress smiles.
HASARI
Someone has blessed us. A job, a
roof, a school. Soon I'll be able
to send money home...
(looking at Amrita)
... and put away a little bit for
your dowry.
In their excitement, the boys run.
OUTSIDE
and up to the roof, under the stars.
We LOOK UP WITH
them and:
DISSOLVE TO:
Max is trying to explain to the waiter what he wants.
MAX
Beef. You know -- cow? Minced,
little salt, pepper, slap it flat
like this, throw it on the grill,
flip it.
Now, though, he just glimpses the shiny gas tank and
engine of a motorcycle around the hip of the waiter.
He leans out.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Ashoka, astride his motorcycle, GUNNING the ENGINE as a
boy runs out of a store with an armload of cassettes.
WITH MAX AND WAITER
MAX
Put it on the grill, I'll be right
back.
WITH ASHOKA
He pulls the boy's ear, REVS the ENGINE to go... and
senses someone close. He turns to find an American
hovering at his shoulder.
MAX
You know, I have to say you
really don't look Jewish. I
believe that's mine.
He reaches for the necklace with the Hebrew letter.
Ashoka recognizes Max. Looks around for help. There is
none.
ASHOKA
Don't touch me. No one touches me.
MAX
Really?
Max grabs Ashoka... who breaks free, and GUNS the CYCLE
down a side street. Max gives chase, his aching ribs
slowing him a bit.
43.
SEVERAL CUTS
Ashoka, glancing back, begins to open up some distance.
Yet, Max hangs tough, weaving like a broken field runner
through the mass of bodies and vehicles. Now, suddenly,
he loses Ashoka. He has to make a choice about this
corner or that one. He chooses.
The only light is the feeble waver from a candle. The
blind Meeta lies on a rough mattress on the ground. Her
ragged sari is pulled up to her middle. Her face runs
with sweat, her hair is plastered to her face. A girl
with black eyes is fanning her with a piece of wood.
Meeta sends up a SOFT, uninterrupted MOAN. A wedge of
blood-soaked cloth is between her legs.
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
A middle-age leper is leaning over her -- a midwife,
encouraging Meeta with a string of commands in their
own language.
Max kneels, Aloka at his side.
His breathing becomes
shallow... but then he pulls off
the blood-soaked
bandages. Between Meeta's legs
he can just make out
the bottom of a foot. The child
is breached. Maybe
already dead.
ALOKA
Will she die?
Max goes into reflex actions. Joan has opened the first
aid kit. There's a flashlight among the medicine,
alcohol, compresses, scissors, etc. He hands the flash-
light to Aloka as...
MAX
(to Joan)
Pull me two c.c.'s of Coramine.
He nods at Aloka; she illuminates the scene.
MAX
Uh-oh, uh-oh, who's this coming'
down the lane? Why it's -- is it
possible -- way over here, in
India -- yes, it's Mr. Choke.
He comes to a stop. Everyone stares at him. Meeta
moans. For a moment, he stays frozen. Aloka reaches
out instinctively, wipes the sweat from his eyes. This
gesture seems to free him; he looks at her, looks at the
room and its expectant, trusting faces...
MAX
I'm going to have to turn it --
the baby. Tell her she has to
relax these muscles as much as
she can.
He doesn't finish the sentence. Aloka speaks softly to
Meeta as Max takes Meeta's arm, makes a tourniquet.
Joan hands him the syringe and he injects. Hands the
syringe back to Joan and begins to work at turning the
baby.
Aloka takes Meeta's hand and it's a moment before we
realize Aloka, with her fine hand, is holding Meeta's
fingerless palm.
52.
OUTSIDE
A small group waits, trying to determine from the sounds
what's happening inside. Anouar pours tea from a pot on
the small fire, offers the cup to Hasari. Hasari stares
at the cup, doesn't want to be impolite, but more than
that, doesn't want to touch the cup. He shakes his head,
smiles. Anouar drinks off the tea.
INSIDE
Sweat pours down Max's face into his eyes. He shakes it
out. Aloka leans forward and, with her new sari, wipes
the sweat away again. Max nods thanks.
MAX
Tell her again to breathe in short
little bursts now.
He demonstrates. Aloka does the same to Meeta. Meeta
tries to cooperate. And suddenly Max has the baby
turned.
MAX
All right!
Now, tell her to push.
Aloka translates. Meeta pushes.
The midwife, the little
girl, Aloka lean forward.
MAX
Again.
Yes!
Again.
It's coming.
OUTSIDE
No one is sitting now. Everyone hangs close to the
door. Only Hasari remains apart, seated on a tree stump
in the middle of the quad. He coughs; suppresses it.
INSIDE
MAX
I've got the head. Come on,
little baby, come on, little
baby. Be alive, be alive, be
alive.
Aloka wipes the sweat away again. He looks at her, his
voice squeezed out through his teeth.
MAX
We've got it, we've got it.
Yeah!
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
He seems as released as Meeta. Then he gives a last
gentle tug and a CRY squeezes out of the little piece of
life in his hands. Max is fairly overwhelmed by the life
in his hands. Poomina steps close, a smile on her lovely
face, and touches the baby in Max's hands.
Max hears Joan praying inside.
JOAN (O.S.)
Jesus, my brother, you who I am
trying to believe are the light
and salvation of the puking world
...
THE PALS
Aloka sits huddled with her husband while their children
sleep; they listen...
JOAN (O.S.)
Please see that we are living in
madness and darkness here...
MAX
listens.
JOAN (O.S.)
... and we need help. Om, Jesus,
om and amen.
Suddenly, he hurtles into motion. He runs down the alley,
his stride stretching out, swallowing up the distance
between here and the world beyond the City of Joy in
great gulps.
It's a small place; it's sweltering, and it's packed
with hundreds of families shoulder to shoulder. Though
Betsy's trying to be discreet, it's not a very private
place, as we see by the number of people watching Max
and Betsy.
BETSY
I bought it, I got a refund!
MAX
But I want to go home with you.
BETSY
You want to go home with me?
MAX
Yes.
BETSY
Then prove it.
MAX
Good -- how -- name it.
BETSY
Buy yourself a ticket.
MAX
I would love to do
that, Betsy
Ilene, boy would I
love to do
just that, but I'm
financially
embarrassed at the
--
BETSY
Use your credit cards.
MAX
What credit cards? You know I
maxed them before we left. Just
lend me --
BETSY
No! You won't pay me back; you
never have. Oh, Max!
MAX
They're calling our flight. I
want to go home with you, Betsy
Ilene Kahn. Because I have a
vision. It's...
He's trying to woo and charm her.
He mimes a kind of
house shape.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
MAX
I see you and me, Betsy Ilene
Kahn, nibbling toward each other
through a quarter pounder with
cheese, chugalugging a frosty
light beer -- great taste! Less
filling! Bowling! I want to go
bowling, Besty Ilene Kahn!
He fires a strike through the watching crowd.
MAX
I want... Oh, my Lord Amighty, I
want so many American things --
BETSY
Oh, stop it! You have no earthly
idea what you want, Max! And
stop calling me Betsy Ilene Kahn.
MAX
Isn't that your name?
BETSY
You call me Betsy Ilene Kahn like
you just met me yesterday.
MAX
What should I call you?
My girl,
my significant other --
BETSY
Don't get cute! You get cute and
I swear to God --- you told me once
I look like my mother!
MAX
You do -- so what?
BETSY
See -- you don't understand!
MAX
How could I possibly not
understand a conversation as easy
as this one, Betsy Ilene.
BETSY
I hate you!
MAX
Na ya don't.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
BETSY
I stood by you for three years!
MAX
I know.
BETSY
I supported you through your
internship!
MAX
You did.
BETSY
Why? It was never working. What
have I been thinking all these
years -- that you'd change?
You're the most self-pitying,
self-destructive, self...
She can't find anything fierce enough, so she abates,
tries to get it together to make a dignified exit.
BETSY
But you've taught me something,
Max. You never finish anything.
Well, I quit. I've found my
light and I'm free of you.
She heads for the gate, people parting to give her a
wide berth.
MOVING SHOT - TOWARD THE GATE
MAX
Will you at least call my mother
and ask her to empty my savings
account and wire --
BETSY
Do it yourself, Max. Call her
collect. You should have called
her weeks ago anyway just because
she's your mother!
(to herself)
White light, white light...!
She hands her ticket and boarding pass over and she's
through the gate. Max turns to find the audience fixed
on him.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
MAX
Guerilla theater, folks. 'All the
world's a stage.'
Don't know if
that word reached you here yet.
If you'd care to show your
appreciation by a small donation...
Many smiles... and several instant offers of rupees.
A
beat, then...
MAX
Aw, what the hell.
... Swallowing his incredible embarrassment, Max takes
the money.
Max with his stethoscope to Meeta's baby. Meeta in a
brightly-colored sari and a lot of bracelets and Aloka
looks on. Poomina clings to the wall.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
MAX
He's just malnourished. Is she
giving him the milk we gave her or
selling it?
Aloka asks Meeta in Hindi. Meeta clearly swears she's
giving the baby the milk. Aloka pushes her.
ALOKA
Not all.
Most.
MAX
Tell her to give all the milk to
the baby.
Aloka does so as Max bounces the baby, coos to it play-
fully. The baby pees all over him. Aloka translates
quickly. Meeta starts apologizing. Poomina can't help
laughing. Max reminds Meeta that that's once for each
of the two weeks of the baby's life. Aloka soothes Meeta
as she hustles her, Poomina, and the baby out, then
quickly begins to wipe Max's face with a clean rag. This
isn't something she's accustomed to doing, but she's
doing it before she has time to think. Max finds himself
conscious of her closeness to him... and then she becomes
suddenly self-conscious and she backs off, ducks her
head. He peeks up under.
MAX
Psst.
She looks at him.
MAX
It's okay.
He smiles.
So does she.
The MUSIC is of days gone by, playing on an old RADIO.
Sticks of burning incense send off trails of smoke. The
godfather, MR. GHATAK, Looking infirm, wipes a tear from
his eye.
GHATAK
Acha!
Now we see
Max and Joan seated on cushions before the
godfather,
tea in hand. Max catches a glimpse in an
anteroom of
several thugs with several young girls, one
of whom is
Poomina. She catches a glimpse of Max as she
disappears
past a door. A moment later, her head peeks
around the
door frame. She brings her hands together.
ASHOKA (O.S.)
You!
Poomina quickly disappears.
Max's attention is pulled
back to the godfather...
GHATAK
I understand that you're interested
in expanding your clinic and free
school, and that you intend to
start treating lepers in the City
of Joy.
JOAN
We'd like to better serve the
entire community, Mr. Ghatak.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
GHATAK
Of course. That's very good.
Admirable. And we'd be pleased to
rent you suitable space. But you
must understand that certain
payments will go up.
JOAN
I understand the rent would have
to go up if we rent larger
quarters from you, Mr. Ghatak, but
why should we have to pay more
protection?
GHATAK
More people, more potential
trouble. Strangers. If I don't
charge you, what will I tell
others?
JOAN
But we can't afford it!
GHATAK
Surely if you can expand, you can
pay more.
Joan throws up her hands -- how do you reason with this
man?
MAX
Am I stupid, but isn't this
protection money money we're
paying you to protect us from you?
GHATAK
We live in chaotic times, Miss
Bethel, Doctor. I control the
City of Joy and maintain it as a
model of harmony. It's a miracle,
but a very fragile miracle.
MAX
And how are we threatening your
miracle?
GHATAK
I admire your courage in choosing
to work in such a violent place,
Miss Bethel.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
GHATAK (CONT'D)
Your neighbors in the City of Joy,
they're not educated, they're
given to violence, to meanness, I
can promise you they won't like
having lepers among them, but
because they know you're under my
protection...
He dispatches a globule of spit into the copper urn next
to his right toe... and tries to get to his feet. The
Goonda hurries forward to help him.
GHATAK
Doctor, do you like our music?
MAX
Well, I can't say I've developed a
craving for it yet.
GHATAK
It's difficult to appreciate what
we don't understand, isn't it?
Let me put it another way: The
world is a terrible place. Only
the ruthless prevail. My son will
make the arrangements with you.
One of the thugs helps the godfather outside, where, in
the b.g., we see him listening to his music and pottering
in his garden. As Max and Joan turn, Max finds himself
face to face with Ashoka, who wears Max's necklace and
chai. There's a long pause as the two of them take the
other's measure.
MAX
(to Ashoka)
I like your taste in neckwear.
Joan puts a cautioning hand on Max's arm. Ashoka seems
just the slight bit uneasy dealing with Max and so keeps
trying to direct himself to Joan. He smokes a long
Indian cigarette.
ASHOKA
The entire package we're proposing
will cost you three thousand rupees
a month.
Joan is taken aback by the sum.
JOAN
If we pay you that, we won't have
any money for supplies.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
ASHOKA
I'm told you're very resourceful.
MAX
I think I see a solution. May I?
What if we were to work out a
profit-sharing arrangement? We
give you a share of our net profit.
ASHOKA
How do you expect to make a profit
off of lepers and the poor, Doctor?
MAX
Beats the hell outta me, asshole.
But you've obviously found a way.
The question would seem to be whether Ashoka will have
Max killed here or outside the house. His eyes on Max,
Ashoka puts the cigarette out against the back of his
hand... and smiles at Max.
It's dark and claustrophobic. The air vibrates with the
SQUEAL and CLATTER of METAL. About twenty kids sit in a
line, back to back, manipulating aseries of lethal and
unprotected lathes and polishers. No one can hear his
neighbor.
69.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Hasari, with Shambu in the rickshaw, arrives to take the
children home. As he looks inside, he notices...
HASARI'S POV
Not far from Amrita sits a handsome boy (Subash). He
catches Amrita's eyes. Amrita is sweetly embarrassed
to find her father staring at her.
ON HASARI
But he can't help but smile. At the same time he's re-
minded moment to moment of his various obligations.
Max's cigar. He sits slightly apart from Joan, Sunil,
Aloka, Ram, Hasari, Selima, Margareta, Surya, SALADDIN,
ASHISH and Shanta, Aristotle John, MEHBOUB, Anouar, and
Said.
Hasari is stretched out, Aloka rubbing his screaming
legs. Throughout the following, their eyes meet and
deflect...
SALADDIN
The Godfather is at least
civilized. The son is vicious.
Remember the last elections -- the
Molotov coctails, the blows with
iron bars. They'll throw us out.
We won't be able to find anyone
else to rent to us. We'll just
have to agree to pay what he
wants.
MEHBOUB
Saladdin's right. Neither nature
nor the people with the power
have any conscience. We have to
pay.
A sigh escapes Surya.
He shakes his head.
Eyes
flick at him.
ASHISH
What do you say, Doctor Big
Brother?
SUNIL
I think we must try to break the
Godfather's hold on us.
This is startling and is met with a babble of cautious
agreement and dispute.
SUNIL
Please, hear me out. But I think
we have to be very cautious.
MAX
How the hell do you proceed with
caution against these people?
You can't. You have to risk
everything.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
MAX (CONT'D)
You try to negotiate with these
people, you make compromises with
them, they'll eat you alive. Stand
up against them now and they'll
fold. I guarantee it. Underneath,
they're cowards, they got no guts.
We show them we're strong and
the'll just move on to easier
pickings.
ASHISH
We?
You have an airplane ticket.
Still, he's clearly piqued a lot of support.
SUNIL
You know, Max, this is not
American gangster television.
SALADDIN
Yes, if you're wrong, you don't
have to be here.
MAX
I'm not wrong. You bow your heads,
you plead with your Gods to do
what you won't do yourselves.
You put up with this nightmare
as if there were no choice. I'm
telling you, if you don't stand
up to that little pimple face
now, he'll own you for the rest
of your lives.
Everyone stares at him. Many of them want to buy his
commitment. There's another large sigh from Surya.
Aloka and Hasari's eyes bang off of each other, she
silently urging him to speak. He's deeply conflicted
and deeply frightened.
ANOUAR
Even though I am invisible to some
of you and I don't have a complete
set of legs to stand on, I stand
with the Doctor Big Brother. Maybe
nature doesn't have a conscience
or those with the power, but don't
we?
Said, the giant mute, mades an unintelligible sound in
his throat, but clearly he's agreeing with Anouar.
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
MARGARETA
I agree with Anouar and Max Daddah.
I think it's worth the chance.
Silence... until Aloka and Hasari's meet again and, out
of his terrible fear and conflict, he says very shyly...
HASARI
Is it permitted to speak?
There are quick nods around the room.
With great difficulty,
Hasari says his piece.
HASARI
I want my children to be educated
and cared for; this is our home,
we have never had such friends.
But many of us owe a great debt
to the Godfather. He is strong
and could kill us... But we must
choose. I trust my Big Brother.
I say we must stand up.
There's still dissension, but somewhat more support.
Said makes a fierce, unintelligible supportive sound.
Surya sighs again. Eyes flick at the old man.
SUNIL
Sister Joan, what do you think,
really?
JOAN
Well, I think Max has hit on the
heart of what we're trying to build
here: a self-help society. Each
of us has to decide for himself.
As for me, I suppose I think,
really, that if the bastards are
going to suck us dry, I'd like to
get in a couple of good left-
handers before I turn the other
cheek.
SALLADIN
But who will rent to us!
Surya clucks his tongue and shakes his head; everyone
assumes he is preparing a heated refutation of the
resisters. His sighs, though, have been a building
commitment.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
SURYA
I have a property I will
rent you
for two hundred rupees a
month,
and not a rupee less. As
for
protection... you are on
your own.
Many of the faces are uncertain -- Hasari's notable among
them.
A) Two cows are shooed out of the ramshackle building as
bustling activity on the new clinic begins. Cleaning
the place. Debris being torn out, hurled into a
pile in the street.
B) Said, with the strength of three men, holds up a heavy
beam while Hasari tries to secure it. Max, hot,
smelly, and hating the place, stands in the middle of
the room, wishing he were elsewhere. The beams starts
to slip. Max leaps to Hasari's side.
C) We see
that Max and Hasari are thrown together again
in some
carpentering task in uneasy camaraderie. A
finger
pokes Max on the back. He turns to find
Poomina
holding out two cups of tea.
D) The whole
group shares a meal, prepared under
the
direction
of Selima, though the lepers remain
separate
from the
normals. Anouar leads the lepers in
singing
a song.
Joan and Margareta pick it up, as do
several
other of
the normals.
E) Equipment from the old school/clinic being moved from
the square down here.
F) Max and Aloka do one of those dances where two people
with arms loaded try to go around each other. Finally
he says he'll stand still and she should go around
him. They both laugh. Hasari watches.
G) As Max puts medicine into a cabinet, Ram peeks in,
nods his approval, "helpfully" passes Max something
Max can reach just fine himself, shows Max an enormous
hole in his shorts and hits Max for ten rupees.
H) A small truck carrying a charitable organization's
logo on the side is being unloaded of powdered milk
and various other things.

74.
CONTINUED:
I) UPSTAIRS AND STAIRWELL
Hasari and Max
move the last cot upstairs and into
place beside a
window that will come into play at the
end (It looks
down on the street). Hasari nods to Max,
indicating he
should look.
J) THEIR POV
Everyone gathered as Shanta and Ashish put a banner
above the door: "You are invited to the festival of
this world and your life is blessed." The assemblage
applauds and embraces.
K) UPSTAIRS
Hasari smiles at Max, brings his hands together, but
doesn't embrace the doctor.
People peer in through every opening. Mehboub's chest is
bandaged. Sunil squeezes through the packed courtyard
and hallway, Ashish carrying a wounded woman behind him.
Hasari steps into a doorway, us WITH him.
Max, blood crusted on her face, sutures Poomina's awful
facial wound as Aloka prepares a compress.
ALOKA
Will she... Her face, will it...
MAX
If she's very careful and doesn't
do anything to open the wound, the
scarring will be minimal.
(to Poomina)
Do you understand? You can't...
You have to stay here.
(to Joan)
You make her stay here.
JOAN
I'll try.
MAX
Don't goddamn try, Joan!
Goddamn
do it!
Poomina peers through her pain at Max, his hands putting
her back together.
MAX
(a litany)
I hate this place, I hate this
place, I hate this place.
Max looks at the doorway and he locks eyes with Hasari.
Max breaks the contact. Hasari stares at him as we hear
the godfather's MUSIC on the RADIO.
82.
Flickering candlelight illuminates the "Raft of Medusa."
Max rails at Joan.
MAX
I just don't... I don't want to...
I don't want to care! I don't want
to care this much! I just don't
want to be invested in you people.
In people! I became a goddamn
doctor because my goddamn father
wanted me to be a goddamn doctor
because he was a goddamn doctor!
He was the goddamn king of
doctors! It's too goddamn hard!
Out of breath, out of words, Joan reaches out and takes
Max to her, brings him beside her on the cot. Beneath
the "Raft of Medusa," she sits with an arm around Max, as
if he were her son.
JOAN
Not everyone's cut out for this.
You did the best you could.
Better than many. It's all right.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
MAX
I didn't do the best I could! I
did what I always do! I shot my
big mouth off and did a half-assed
job. And what I want to do now is
I want to go back to America and
make money and live a life without
entanglements and demands and
people hanging on me.
JOAN
(a beat)
You know, the fact is from the
minute we're born we're
shipwrecked. Some see that as a
lifetime of drowning, of fear,
others only to endure, but to
triumph. It's all in the
individual spirit, isn't it?
MAX
Got it: To run, to spectate, to
commit.
(raises his hand)
Running spectator.
JOAN
Then, by all means, go home, Max,
and go with my blessing and my
eternal friendship.
The candlelight flickers against them as they sit side
by side. Neither speaks.
Alone in his pain, he spots his tea caddy in which he
planted his seeds over a month ago. He bends over to
tenderly touch the growing shoot and water the earth.
He looks up and the three children are staring at him.
What will their father do now to keep them alive?
The needle injected, Hasari's blood flowing into a
bottle.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Hasari seated on the stool, watching his blood leave his
body, his face again broken out in perspiration.
HIS POV - RAFIK
Waiting.
BACK TO SCENE - HASARI
His face immobile, his thoughts distant. The Attendant
starts to pull the needle out. Hasari stops his hand.
HASARI
Take more.
The Attendant shakes his head.
HASARI
Take more.
The Attendant looks at Rafik, who shrugs, nods... and
allows the blood to flow on out of Hasari's body.
Hasari and Gangooly enter. A repulsive smell almost
makes Hasari gag. Gangooly takes Hasari's arm and steers
him through the gloom. Hasari discovers the origin of
the smell.
A line of skeletons arranged along the walls. Tables
stacked with bones: skulls, spines, rib cages, hands
and feet. Each skeleton sports a label with a price in
U.S. dollars.
Crouched among the bones and packing crates are men work-
ing. Some smoke, some have masks over their faces. They
scrape and clean and decorticate. They skillfully
assemble their grisly creations, emotionless but like
artists.
89.
POV - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY
THROUGH a dusty, glass, interior window, we see, almost
in mime, the manager examining Hasari.
With a smile, the manager produces some papers. Hasari
shakes his head, starts for the door. Gangooly stops
him.
GANGOOLY
Of course, take some time, think
about it. People all over the
world, anxiously waiting, willing
to pay. 15,000 rupees for a
kidney. 25,000 for an eye.
Gangooly winks, peers at Hasari with a single eye, and
smiles.
Heat haze on the road. As we FOCUS, we FIND Max, Joan,
Aloka, also with their thoughts. Joan gazes out the
window of the taxi. Max looks at the back of Joan's head
a moment, then looks at Aloka, who sits between them.
She deflects his eyes forward.
JOAN
Hasari has forbid her to have
anything more to do with us. He'd
be very angry if he knew she was
seeing you off.
Max looks at Joan.
Looks out the window.
First we see joyous people greeting arriving passengers;
parents greet a young man returning from college abroad.
The way clears and we CLOSE IN ON Max, Joan, and Aloka, a
tiny island in this sea of people at the moment of their
parting. Max empties all the money out of his pockets.
MAX
This is for Poomina.
When I get
home...
He thrusts the money on Joan and Max offers his hand;
she goes through the hand to embrace Max. Then Max and
Aloka look at each other.
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
ALOKA
You did good things.
(chokes up, but
manages)
Thank you for coming to our
country.
And now Max heads out the door.
Sparsely populated.
They sit in isolation at a table
over a cup of tea.
JOAN
It's not like
he's royalty or
anything, so
I'm not persuaded we
have to wait
for the plane to
actually take
off.
ALOKA
No.
We should go.
Yet, they
remain another moment... then get up. Joan
puts her
arm around Aloka and they turn to go. The looks
on their
faces suggest they've come face to face with
something
startling.
ANGLE ON DOOR
Max.
Standing inside the departure doorway.
MAX
What were those three choices
again?
Their faces. And his with just a wistful version of his
old grin... and we --
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
He finds his family... and Max.
The two men stare at
each other.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
MAX
I need Aloka at the clinic.
(as Hasari stares)
All right, they, the patients,
need her. She's a good nurse.
(as Hasari stares)
Come on, man, this is between you
and me. Why take the kids out of
school, why punish your wife?
Hasari holds his anger in; he moves to a mat and lies
down, his back to Max. But Max doesn't go.
MAX
I have a little money, I can get
it from the States...
HASARI
It's not a question of money.
We'll survive on our own.
That's it. Hasari lies with his back to Max. After some
moments of silence, Aloka indicates Max should go. And
he does. After another moment...
ALOKA
Maybe he's right. The clinic is
for everyone and if I am needed --
Hasari bolts up, a look of anger on his face we've never
seen.
HASARI
No! I'm your husband and you'll
do as I say! Unless, of course,
you've become an American wife and
then you'll do as you please!
HASARI
Stay away from them. They are not
part of us. They will only be good
to you as long as you please them.
The children, Aloka are frozen, she very close to tears.
Hasari lies back down, again turns his back on them.
Max unwraps a bandage from a leper's partial limb. Looks
around for Aloka. She's not there. Said is acting as
his nurse. Points at his instruments.
MAX
Hand me the scissors, please.
Helpfully Said hands him the tweezers.
MAX
Scissors, scissors.
He demonstrates. Said fumbles through the instruments,
picking up the scissors by the ends.
MAX
Not that end -- No, that's fine,
thanks, I've got it.
Max follows Anouar past bubbling cauldrons and heaps of
animal skins. The place stinks fiercely. Anouar and
Max exit into...
A SMALL YARD
Two young men (the two pullers Chomotkar and Ramatullah)
... and something covered with a tarp.
MAX
You didn't steal this.
RAMATULLAH
The police, Sahib, they stole it.
We stole it from them.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
The pullers whip the tarp off. A battered rickshaw, the
springs poking out of the seat, the broken wheels lying
in the body, the finish scarred and gouged, one shaft
broken.
MAX
How much?
FROM BEHIND, we watch Max take a wrapping off of
Poomina's wound, Joan assisting him. Indeed, Ashoka
extended Poomina's smile on either side of her mouth.
The scars are healing as nicely as could be expected.
Max did a fine job.
MAX
You must have had a good doctor.
Still no running, jumping, picking
up anything heavy. And you stay
here. You're going to help Sister
Joan and you're going to school.
Do you understand?
A beat, Poomina nods.
But now a look of abject fear
comes over her face.
The Goonda stands in the doorway. Max begins singing
"Sweet Little Sixteen." The Goodna stares impassively
at Max.
THE GOONDA
Time to collect the rent, Sister.
JOAN
Of course.
Come with me, please.
Joan leaves, followed by The Goonda. Max works care-
fully at the fine line of scabbing on Poomina's scar...
but then something takes his attention.
ACROSS THE COURTYARD
Manooj, with a small tin of food, looks this way and
that... and then sneaks into the shed.
Startled, frightened, Hasari presses himself against the
wall, as does Manooj. Hasari is wearing a wet dhoti,
caught in the middle of straightening the wheel rim of
the old rickshaw.
HASARI
Close the door!
Max is very surprised but, needless to say, pleased.
He
looks at the rickshaw, looks at Hasari.
HASARI
Close the door. The Godfather
has more eyes than a pineapple.
Max quickly closes the door. The half light is broken
by thin beams of light that dance with dust.
Hasari studies Max a moment, then moves to put the first
wheel on. Instinctively, Manooj moves to his side, takes
hold of the rickshaw so Hasari can slip the wheel on.
Hasari nods and goes for the other wheel. Manooj moves
around to the other side, hefts the carcass. Hasari
slips on the second wheel. Hasari looks at Max. Max
brings his hands together and starts to go.
HASARI
I was saying to Manooj that if a
man bows down too many times,
there will come a day when he will
no longer be able to stand upright.
The two men look at each other... and then Hasari gets
on with his work.
MAX
I promised Manooj and Shambu I'd
take them to the movies. Is it
all right?
HASARI
(a beat)
If a man makes a promise...
Max brins his hands together and starts for the door.
Hasari picks up one of the worn seat boards.
We're TRACKING WITH a moving bag of peanuts behind a row
of boy's heads. On the screen in front of them, a "medi-
eval era" sword battle between the great Kumar Kapur and
a legion of bad guys.
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
We hear the sound of CRACKING NUTS as we MOVE FROM Manooj
to three kids we've seen in the neighborhood (two boys
Manooj's age and Shoba, who's Shambu's age) and then to
Shambu, each kid dipping into the bag in his turn.
Finally: Max's (and on the other side of him, Amrita
and Poomina.) The bag arrives... empty.
MAX
(whispering)
Thanks, guys. Who wants to go for
more peanuts?
No one. We're talking about rapt attention.
We hear
NUTS CRACKING. Max smiles.
The wards are full, as are the corridors. Patients on
beds and stretchers everywhere. Most have at least one
member of their family to look over them. In a side
room, Max is arguing with a porter who tells him he can't
help him.
Max slaps some rupees into the porter's hand,
tells him to take him to the person in charge.
Shambu is fading. Aloka smooths the sweat from his brow,
trying to keep Shambu alive by force of will and love.
Then Max is back, standing over her with another man. It
may take a moment before we recognize the ATTENDANT from
the Blood Bank.
MAX
They'll admit him, but we have to
pay for the blood. I gave him all
I had. He wants more. Do you have
anything?
ALOKA
Sister Joan gave me this.
Aloka holds out a fistful of rupees. The Attendant blows
through his lips, indicating it's a paltry sum. Max
grabs the money and shoves it at the Attendant.
MAX
We haven't got any more!
The Attendant doesn't move... until he sees Max is about
to explode.
MAX
If this child dies while you
stand here, I'll kill you.
The Attendant is smart enough not to push any further.
MAX
Now, I need an X-ray room and I
need an O.R. nurse.
ATTENDANT
Not possible. You can't give
care, you're an American. You
must be an Indian doctor.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
MAX
Then take me to one!
As Max takes flight with the Attendant, Aloka strokes
Shambu and Hasari hovers. We CLOSE IN ON Shambu's
inanimate face and HOLD a moment.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Max hurtles down the corridor with a young INTERN in
tow. Almost a kid, he's been up for days. But he's
going to help.
INTERN
This way, please.
Max scoops Shambu up and rushes down the corridor behind
the Intern, leaving Hasari and Aloka looking after him.
His arm comes around her shoulders.
dip into a little box of paints. The boys look on as the
two men paint an intricate design on the shafts. Shambu
sits in the rickshaw seat. He wears an ankle to hip
cast. Manooj is spelling words and urging Shambu to
follow suit. Aloka is putting out a tray of food. Ram,
Ramatullah, and Chomotkar slip in, quickly close the
door. The two pullers focus on the rickshaw, Ram on Max.
RAM
Doctor Daddah, please, very
important, only one moment.
MAX
This is going to cost me every
rupee I didn't make today.
Ram thrusts an envelope into Max's hand.
MAX
A letter from your wife.
Ram nods nervously. Max looks at the postmark as he
slices it open with a finger.
MAX
This is postmarked six weeks ago.
RAM
So?
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
MAX
So, what have you been doing --
incubating it?
RAM
I was afraid.
Ram waits, his hands twisting each other.
MAX
'My dear husband...'
RAM
Oh that's very hopeful so far!
MAX
'Your words brought tears of joy
to my arid eyes.'
RAM
Oh, I'm in love! My words
brought tears to her arid eyes!
(then fearful)
What does that mean -- arid?
Manooj throws his hand up.
MANOOJ
I know!
Dry.
MAX
Correct. Her eyes were dry, your
letter irrigated them.
RAM
Aaah!
He snatches the letter, crushes it to his heart.
Notices
the finish work on the rickshaw.
CHOMOTKAR
This is a puka nasgar. What a
curse that you can't use it.
HASARI
I'm going on the streets tomorrow.
This gets everyone's attention.
The pullers shake their
heads, they're worried for him.
MAX
Listen. I don't want you to think
I'm crazy, but I don't think that
truck was an accident.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
MAX CONT'D)
I think Ashoka was after me. You
can bet he'll be after you too.
HASARI
I'm going to speak to his father.
MAX
Can I go with you? I'll go with
you. Can I go with you if I shut
up?
A beat... and Hasari gives him a small nod.
The manager stares at Hasari, as he consumes a pot of
rice and vegetable curry. Gangooly hovers like a crow.
Hasari stares at the contract before him.
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
HASARI
If a man dies and he's not burned,
what do you think becomes of his
soul?
The manager turns his palms up, continues chewing.
Hasari stares through the window at the row of skeletons.
HASARI
I must provide for my family.
GANGOOLY
Oh, it's a noble fate. If indeed
your wheel ceases to turn, you will
help educate somewhere in this
great world a fine doctor.
Hasari bends to the contract and laboriously signs his
name.
Birds flying
below ceiling. The room has a barred cage
running all
around its edge; the cage is filled to near
overflowing.
Hasari stands before the JUDGE, his face
covered with
blood, his body a mass of aches and welts.
At the back
of the room, Max and Aloka; elsewhere,
Ashoka, the
Goonda, and several of his thugs.
HASARI
The life of a rickshaw puller is
not one a man would choose if he
had a choice. Our feet blister
and burn up from the boiling
asphalt, our noses burn from the
fumes of countless motor cars and
buses, our backs curve permanently
from the loads we carry hour after
hour, day after day. But I am
proud to be one of the human horses
who carry my countryman from place
to place and I am thankful for the
opportunity to make a living. But
I will not keep silent anymore and
I will not be cheated and
threatened anymore. Life is hard
enough. No more.
Ramatullah starts to applaud.
Rassoul follows suit.
The Judge bangs his gavel.
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
JUDGE
Silence!
(when it's silent)
This man will be permitted to
use his rickshaw without let or
hindrance. And I will make a
restraining order against Mr.
Ghatak.
Cheers from the pullers.
The Judge bangs his gavel.
JUDGE
I haven't finished these
proceedings. For his part in this
disturbance, I fine the defendant
50 rupees.
HASARI
Fifty rupees, Your Honor?
That's --
JUDGE
Pay at this time or spend seven
days in jail!
Seven days in jail will cost him far more than fifty
rupees. As he reaches into his pocket for his screw
of money, a hand suddenly protrudes into the cage through
the bars.
RAMATULLAH
Hasari!
And now another hand with several rupees reaches through.
RASSOUL
Hasari!
Now a dozen voices call his name and a
dozen hands reach
through the bars with rupees clutched
in their fists and
press the money into Hasari's hands.
The Judge, Max and
Aloka, and certainly Ashoka watch this
in amazement. The
Judge bangs his gavel.
Max turns, shoots a little finger gun and winks at Ashoka.
CLOSE ON ASHOKA
ON his face, we see pure hatred for these two men.
110.
Rain. Max, The Pals, Ram, Joan, Anouar, Meeta and the
Baby, Poomina, Saladdin, Mehboub, Ashish, Shanta,
Margareta, Bandona, and the other members of the commit-
tee sharing a meal.
HASARI
Really -- a boyfriend, Amrita?
AMRITA
No!
Amrita whacks Manooj.
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
MANOOJ
Yes, she does. His name is Subash
Ghosh. His father owns the workshop.
HASARI
Is there someone you care about?
The look in Amrita's eyes tells us indeed there is.
Hasari smiles at Amrita and then at Aloka.
HASARI
Then I must speak to his father
and I must complete your dowry.
Amrita squeezes close to her mother.
This is serious
and joyous.
HASARI
You will make people sigh at how
beautiful you are. And I shall
drop tears of joy.
RAM
At my wedding I became so
frightened, my father gave me
things to drink to calm me down.
I went out to piss and fell asleep
under the village tree. When I
woke I thought it was the tree I'd
married. I still love that tree.
The laugh. But Hasari's attention is on his daughter.
He reaches a loving hand to her.
A rag has been wrapped around the faucet and water runs
slowly and silently down into the nearly filled tub. The
scene is illuminated dimly by a flashlight with fingers
over the beam.
ON MAX
He sleeps. Suddenly he's grabbed, his eyes spring open
in fear. Hands yanks him out of bed, slam him up against
the wall, then hurtle him across the room and into:
BATHROOM
Where the tub has been filled. His head is slammed down
underwater and he's held there struggling.
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
His head is yanked up and through bleary eyes he sees a
knife at his throat and the Hewbrew letter chai dangling
from the knife - wielder's neck, illuminated by a
flashlight.
ASHOKA
Go home, Doctor.
Before he can respond, he's slammed down into the tub of
water again and held there until it seems his lungs will
explode. Then he's dumped backward, gasping for breath.
He bangs on Joan's door. She opens the door in her Indian
pajamas. One look at him...
JOAN
What's happened?
MAX
Ashoka ordered me to go home.
Well, I've come home.
A beat. She steps aside, he steps in, and the door closes
him safely inside.
Water pouring off the room into the courtyard. Hasari
locks his rickshaw into the shed and turns out, attention
to Max, Aloka, Joan, Poomina, Margareta, Mehboub, several
others trying to patch leaking roof tiles and keep
supplies high and dry.
Hasari enters. Max looks at him, doesn't like the look
of the obviously exhausted man.
HASARI
How can I help?
The rain continues, as does the work in the clinic. Max
is working on Anouar, Aloka assisting. Meeta and the
baby (now 6 months old) in the b.g.
ANOUAR
I think Aloka would have a gentler
touch than you, Max Daddah. Maybe
she should perform this surgery on
her own.
Aloka ducks her eyes, embarrassed.
MAX
Last time you told me you were
more than two women could manage.
ANOUAR
Yes, but given a choice between one
and none, I will accept the one.
Max lifts Anouar off the table and places him on his
cart.
MAX
Okay, you ought to be good for
another few days. Send in the
next patient.
Anouar scoots out. Max and Aloka both turn to the
instruments lying on the table and knock a pair of
scissors to the floor. Simultaneously, they bend to pick
it up and bang heads.
LOW ANGLE
The first
impulse of each is to touch the other's head.
But almost
simultaneously, their hands freeze short of
touching.
Several months ago, Max might have tried to
kiss her;
now, though, there is friendship and affection.
FROM here,
we see a pair of bare feet. We COME WITH Max
and Aloka
UP.
116.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Shoba, a deeply concerned look on his face. Slowly his
hands come forward, holding his parrot, with a broken
wing. He puts the parrot on the examining table.
Hasari seals a letter and a money order into an envelope,
seals, and puts it into the slot. He is
clearly
exhausted. Outside he can
see two Sikh merchants at his
rickshaw, looking around in the rain for him. He hurries
toward the door.
HASARI
Here!
I'm here!
Aloka and three women huddled beside a window, Amrita
half hidden behind them. We PAN ACROSS a staircase TO
another window, THROUGH which we see a doorway. In the
doorway, Subash turns to smile a shy smile at Amrita; he
shrugs. PAST him now, we see Hasari facing SUBASH'S
FATHER and three UNCLES, surly men with hair matted with
mustard oil. The Ghoshes are all seated on low chairs
and stools. Hasari is standing.
Mr. Ghosh and the Uncles stare at Hasari, who stands
politely and hopefully before them.
MR. GHOSH (SUBASH'S FATHER)
You're a rickshaw puller, am I
correct?
HASARI
Yes, that's correct.
He looks at his brothers, on either side.
They look at
him.
MR. GHOSH
And I a partner in the workshop
where your daughter is employed.
Were you aware of that?
HASARI
Yes, yes, I was, my daughter told
me, thank you.
(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED:
MR. GHOSH
Yes, well then, perhaps you can
tell me why I would permit my son
to marry your daughter.
Mr. Ghosh raises his palms.
It's all over as far as
he's concerned.
UNCLE #1
Just a moment, please.
The brothers huddle, whisper just loudly enough for
Hasari to hear.
UNCLE #1
Are you saying there's no way
you'd consider this match?
Mr. Ghosh shakes his head, shrugs his palms.
UNCLE #1
Perhaps some inducement?
Would
that be of any help?
MR. GHOSH
(considering this)
What could he possibly offer?
UNCLE #1
Probably nothing. But perhaps,
in fairness, we should find out.
Mr. Ghosh shrugs.
The huddle breaks.
All five men
stare at Hasari.
We PAN ACROSS members of our group -- lepers and
normals -- passing bowls of rice in a simple communal
meal, Singing a religious song quietly. On the floor
in the b.g., Anouar is writing something on a slightly
damp stretch of cloth with a child's crayon. Said
takes the cloth and tacks it to the wall. What Anouar
has written is this, "All that is not given is lost."
Everyone in the room stares at the words.
122.
Max opens his eyes to find Joan, Hasari, Aloka, and the
children keeping a vigil.
MAX
Oh, Jesus, the guy went to sleep
when he was supposed to be working?
I gotta get up --
He tries to get up.
Joan pushes him back down.
JOAN
Sshh, sshh, sshh! No heroics,
junior. Lay back. You're all
right.
MAX
All right.
(a distant laugh)
Yeah, I am, I'm all right.
He is a little delirious. The boys come close, kneel
at his side, instinctively reach out to him.
MAX
Want you guys to know something.
About me. Wanted to be the
world's greatest heart surgeon,
just one better than my dad. Just
one. First time I'm the lead
surgeon on a case, the main guy, I
choke. Froze. The chief made me
step aside. My teacher. Had to
take over for me. Went into
radiology. Photography. Had to
have somethin' easy. No pressure.
Wasn't too nuts about myself.
Quit.
Hasari reaches out and touches Max, telling him with a
touch that it's all right. He stares up through bleary
eyes at all of them with utterly open love. Amrita
holds out a small gift to him: It's a banana leaf,
holding a small scoop of rice and surrounded by little
decorative leaves.
MAX
You people... You...
(a beat)
I love you guys.
Hasari, Max (dressed quite India), the local Hara Giri,
Mr. Ghosh and the four Ghosh uncles crammed into the
tiny room. Members of our group jam the doorway,
spectating. The air is close.
HASARI
I can offer no more
than I've
offered! No more!
All right,
I'll add two dhotis,
two vests,
and a punjabi. But
that's all.
Mr. Ghosh lights up a bidi, looks at his brothers,
wrinkles his brows at Hasari.
MR. GHOSH
That's all?
Did he say that's
all?
HASARI
My daughter's qualities will make
up for what is lacking.
SUBASH'S FATHER
Well, it won't do! I am firm in
requiring for my exceptional son
the bicycle, 1000 repees... and
one ounce of gold.
HASARI
That's robbery! The child of a
rajah might be worth that, and
I'm not even sure of that!
Impossible!
We linger on Shambu a moment.
Sister Cecilia, in full habit, looks over a sheaf of
test scores.
Then she peers up at...
ANOTHER ANGLE
Manooj, seated between Hasari and Max.
SISTER CECILIA
Well, indeed
I think Sister Joan
is right --
we've got a prospect
here. We'll
start you off with a
few classes;
if that works out,
we'll make a
proper student of you.
(CONTINUED)
124.
CONTINUED:
Hasari can't believe his ears.
Manooj sits frozen.
Max
grins.
A thin stream of dawn light coming through the half-
closed shutters.
FROM HERE - THE BALCONY
Through the open door, we can just see Joan, praying
quietly. Close around her, Anouar, Meeta, Surya, Marga-
reta, Poomina...
THE ROOM
Beneath "The Raft of the Medusa," Hasari Pal speaks to
his family and Max, Aloka sitting close to the bed, the
Children on the bed beside their father, and Max standing
close.
(CONTINUED)
128.
CONTINUED:
HASARI
A man's journey to the end of his
obligations is a very long road.
And you have to remember that you
can never give up. We pray that
life will bless us, that we will
be kings, with possessions and
money that we can rule over all
around us. But it's a mist; the
only thing that makes it possible
to endure life is our love, one
for the other.
A beat, the family and Max tightly bound together.
And
now we hear the dim sounds of RICKSHAW BELLS.
HASARI
I was dreaming the sound of
rickshaw bells, and now I hear
them.
Max opens the windows.
Manooj helps his father sit up.
COURTYARD - THEIR POV
Outside, there are rickshaw pullers filling the courtyard
and spilling out into the street. When the window opens,
all the Pullers start ringing their bells and the room is
full of their music.
HASARI
Are they here for me?
Unquestionably, they are.
HASARI
A city so big. When we arrived,
we didn't have a place to live, a
friend.
He smiles.
OUTSIDE
The many hands with their ringing bells.
CLOSE ON WINDOW
The tiny figure of Shambu joins Max in the window.
Max
bends close.
(CONTINUED)
129.
CONTINUED:
SHAMBU
(whispering)
Is my father going to die?
Max makes the same sound he made in the ashram at the
beginning of the movie, though this sound of dismissal
different.
MAX
Get serious.
Hasari mirrors Max's expression of dismissal!
HASARI
Get serious! I've agreed to the
bicycle, I've agreed to the 1000
rupees! I can go no further. I
have nothing more to give!
OUTSIDE THE HUT
Everyone crowded around the door. From within, we DIMLY
HEAR the negotiations continue. Max approaches from the
clinic. Shambu slips down the steps from above as...
MAX
How's it going?
RAM
All that stands between them now
is the ounce of gold. Max
Daddah, Joan Di -- is she a good
reader?
MAX
What do you mean?
RAM
She read this letter to me.
( he shows Max)
But I think she must have read it
wrong. She said my wife writes
that irrigation has come to our
village.
MAX
But that's great.
(CONTINUED)
130.
CONTINUED:
RAM
But it means I should go home to
my wife.
MAX
I thought that's why we've been
writing all these letters.
RAM
Yes, of course, I love her from
here, yes; but, what if I go home
and find I don't love her from
there.
Shambu takes him by the hand and tugs him quickly to the
edge of the tea shop. The little boy indicates Max
should bend close. Max leans down.
SHAMBU
Daddy needs gold, right?
Max nods.
And Shambu brings his fist up from under the
table.
CLOSE ON SHAMBU'S HAND
He opens his hand to disclose what he scooped off the
ground during the fight: Max's necklace and Hebrew
letter.
SHAMBU
Do you think this is pretend gold
or real?
MAX AND SHAMBU
Max stares at the little boy's hopeful face.
We see the fully blossomed flower in the tea caddy and
then Hasari's fingers come INTO THE FRAME. He carefully
snips the flower free of its stalk.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Amrita is dressed in the beautiful sari her father bought
her. Father and daughter are alone. He hands her the
flower and adjusts her veil tenderly.
(CONTINUED)
131.
CONTINUED:
HASARI
You never did belong to me. You
were only lent to me by God until
you marry and continue the wheel
of life.
Amrita stares at her loving father and slowly her arms
come up around his neck, the flower against his curved
back. Tears fill Hasari's eyes, but a smile graces his
lips.
