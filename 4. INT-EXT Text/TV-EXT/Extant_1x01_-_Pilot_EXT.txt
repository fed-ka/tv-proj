      A celebratory cookout is in full swing.  There are streamers 
      that say "WELCOME HOME", lots of balloons, and TWO DOZEN 
      FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS of all ages and sizes.

      JOHN WATTS (late 30's) mans the grill and chats away with his 
      GUY FRIENDS. John's a handsome academic.

      Ethan plays wiffle ball with some KIDS in the yard.

      Molly holds court with her GIRLFRIENDS, including SAM (late 
      and BETS (40's).

                                  BETS
                    I can't imagine. I'm away from Karl 
                    and the kids for two days, it's 
                    like...

                                  MOLLY
                    I know.

                                  BETS
                    I don't know how you did it.

                                  MOLLY
                    A lot of video conferencing.

                                  BETS
                    And no alcohol?

                                  MOLLY
                    I haven't had a drink in thirteen 
                    months.

                                  BETS
                    Ok, that's like the saddest story 
                    I've ever heard!  We have to remedy 
                    that right now.

                                  MOLLY
                    Can't.

                                  BETS
                    No can'ts, we're doing shots.

                                  MOLLY
                    Doctor's orders...





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      3.

                          (to Sam)
                    Come on, doctor.

                                  SAM
                      Absolutely not.

                                  BETS
                    One shot.

                                  SAM
                    No alcohol until tomorrow, until we 
                    run her tests.  After that, I'll 
                      personally write her a prescription 
                    to get shitfaced.

      The Girls laugh.  Molly glances over and catches John 
      watching her.  He gives her a wink and she smiles at him.

      Across the yard, a commotion breaks out.  Molly looks that 
      way just in time to see Ethan shove a SMALL KID down.

                                  JOHN
                    Ethan!

      John and Molly rush to where Ethan stands over the Kid.

      John grabs Ethan by the arm, Molly helps the Kid up as his 
      PARENTS arrive.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

                                  ETHAN
                    He wouldn't give me the ball.

                                  JOHN
                    And, your solution was to push him?

      Ethan stares at the ground.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What do you say?  Ethan.

      Ethan looks at the kid and holds out the ball.

                                  ETHAN
                    I'm sorry.

      The Kid takes the ball and the standoff eases.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      4.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  JOHN
                    If you do it again, that's it, 
                    that's the end of the party for 
                    you.  You'll be grounded.  Do you 
                      understand?

      Ethan nods.  John walks away with the parents.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I'm so sorry.  I think we're just 
                    having a little trouble with the 
                      transition...

      Molly looks back at the kids.  Ethan looks at her and Molly 
      forces a small smile for him.  He returns the smile and goes 
      back to playing.


      Molly rounds the corner with the garbage and is startled to 
      find a MAN standing in the shadows.  On seeing her, he turns 
      casually and walks the other way.

      She's unnerved but she holds her ground and tosses the trash 
      into a metal bin.  She slides her finger over the bin and an 
      LED readout begins to analyze and process the trash.

      The Verdisign logo is seen on the bin.

      Molly watches the Man reach the other end of the alley before 
      she turns back to the house.


      A coastal city in Florida.

      A good portion of the skyline's architecture is made up of 
      streamlined buildings of glass and steel.  Lots of light and 
      air and green space, both literally and figuratively.


      The car turns into the gated entrance of a black glass 
      monolith that stretches into the heavens.


      A state of the art admin building glistens in the sun.


      The garage door opens and Molly's car pulls out.  She and 
      Ethan drive past the van that was parked in the same spot 
      last night.


      Molly and Ethan sit on the bench near a small ice cream 
      stand.  Both with oversized cones.

      Ethan eats his while Molly punches in Sam's name on her 
      phone.  She dials, and waits.  No answer.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

      CONTINUED:

      She hangs up and takes a breath.

                                  MOLLY
                    How is it?

                                  ETHAN
                    Good.  Do you want to try it?

                                  MOLLY
                    Sure.

      She does.

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    That is good.  Do you want to try 
                    mine?

      He nods.  She gives him a taste.

                                  ETHAN
                    I like yours better.

                                  MOLLY
                    That's called food envy.  Do you 
                    want to switch?

                                  ETHAN
                    Ok.

      They do.  He takes a bite and ends up with a bit of an ice 
      cream mustache. 

      Molly watches him eat his ice cream for a moment.

      A BALLOON VENDOR approaches with two balloons.

                                  MOLLY
                    No thank you.

                                    BALLOON VENDOR
                    They were already paid for.

      He hands one to Ethan.

                                    BALLOON VENDOR (CONT D)
                    This one is for you.

                                  MOLLY
                    Paid for by who?

                                    BALLOON VENDOR
                    The man right...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

      CONTINUED: (2)

      He turns and looks behind him, but there's no one there.

                                    BALLOON VENDOR (CONT D)
                    He's gone.  Sorry.

      Molly sees a card attached to the bottom of her balloon.  She 
      opens it.

      A message inside reads: "I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. 

      CONTACT SOON.  TRUST NO ONE."

      Molly grabs Ethan's arm and pulls him off the bench.

                                  MOLLY
                    We have to go.

                                  ETHAN
                    Mom...

      He drops his ice cream cone.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    You made me drop my ice cream.

                                  MOLLY
                    Here.  You can have this one back.

      She tries to give him the one he had before.

                                  ETHAN
                    I don't want that one.  I want 
                    another one like this.

                                  MOLLY
                    But, this is the one you picked.

                                  ETHAN
                    I don't want it, anymore.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ethan, we have to go.  Now.

                                  ETHAN
                    I want another ice cream.

                                  MOLLY
                    I said let's go!

                                  ETHAN
                    No!




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.

      CONTINUED:

      She yanks his arm and drags him away.  He shrugs her off and 
      takes off running through the park.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ethan!

      She chases after him.


      Ethan runs into a wooded area, along a trail.

      Molly runs after him.

                                  MOLLY
                    Ethan!

      He disappears in the trees.


      Molly searches for him in another section of the trail, 
      exhausted and panicked.

      She looks into a patch of weeds and sees his form, standing a 
      few dozen yards away, facing away from her.

                                  MOLLY
                    Hey!  Answer me.

      He doesn't.  She trudges through the weeds and finds him 
      looking down at something on the ground.

      It's a dead crow, laying at his feet.

      Molly stops.  Ethan turns and looks up at her.

                                  ETHAN
                    It was like this when I found it.

      Molly looks at the crow.  It doesn't look like it's been 
      there long.  She looks back to Ethan.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    Your hair looks really pretty.


      Molly steps out of the house and into the backyard, towards a 
      small building at the back.

      There's a light on inside and music playing.

      Molly opens the door and steps inside...


      Molly opens the door to find Sam on the porch.

                                  MOLLY
                    Hi, I looked all over for your pan 
                    and I couldn't find it.

                                  SAM
                    That's ok, I probably just forgot 
                    and put it away.

      Sam walks her off the porch and into the yard.

                                  MOLLY
                    I'm sorry you came all the way over 
                    here.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    55.

                                  SAM
                    No, it's all right.  An old friend 
                    is in town so we're just out 
                    running around, anyway.

      She looks to her car across the street.

      Molly looks over and the door opens.  The silhouetted figure 
      we've seen, the man with the gloves, steps out.

      In the dim glow of the street lamp, Molly can just make out 
      his features.  She recognizes his face instantly as the man 
      she'd read about, her colleague, HARMON COULTER.

                        END ACT 4

                          ACT 5


      Molly and Coulter talk in the shadows, away from the house.

                                  MOLLY
                    Everyone thinks you're dead.

                                    COULTER
                    Not Sparks.

                                  MOLLY
                    Why do you say that?

                                    COULTER
                    Because he's the one who identified 
                    the body.

                                  MOLLY
                    What body?

                                    COULTER
                    Exactly.

                                  MOLLY
                    It happened to you, too?

                                    COULTER
                    Yes.

                                  MOLLY
                    Who did you see?

                                    COULTER
                    My mother.

                    And, you didn't tell them?

                                    COULTER
                    I told them.  I was worried they 
                    would think I was crazy.

                                  MOLLY
                    What happened?

                                    COULTER
                    I was right.

                    But, why do it, why fake your own 
                    death?

                                    COULTER
                    Because, there's work to do, work 
                    that they can't know about.  Work 
                    that you and I will have to do, 
                    together.

                                  MOLLY
                    I don't understand.

                                    COULTER
                    Molly, you and I are on the 
                    precipice of something monumental, 
                    something that is going to change 
                    the world, forever.  At first, I 
                    thought it was just about contact.  
                    That revealing themselves to us up 
                    there was the big event.  But, now 
                    I think we're looking at something 
                    much bigger.

                                  MOLLY
                    You think they're trying to find a 
                    way to Earth?

      Coulter points to Molly's stomach.

                                    COULTER
                    I think they already have.
