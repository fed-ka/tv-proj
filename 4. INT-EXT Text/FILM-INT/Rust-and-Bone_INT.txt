There is a map of the French rail system near the toilets
in a regional train. While Sam pees, Ali examines it. He
follows the lines to plot out their trip. He arrives where
France ends, at the Mediterranean. Sam comes out of the
bathroom, straightening his pants.
SAM
I'm thirsty.
ALI
We don't have any money.
SAM
I'm thirsty!
A different speed, different countryside.
Ali notices a half-empty bottle of Evian water left on a
tray. He takes it. He searches through the garbage under
other empty seats.
Ali and Sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit, and finish
off abandoned bottles of water.
Another TGV. Rain evaporates off the windows. Ali has
fallen asleep. He's too big for his seat. Sam watches the
landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat. Ali
opens one eye.
ALI
Stop it.
Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their
banging.
ALI
I said to stop it.
The sandals freeze.
Cut.

6. THE CHILD
All of a sudden, Sam is asleep, his eyelids blinking
quickly.
While driving...
RICHARD
(Southern accent)... A couple miles back I
saw a blond guy. (Imitates screeching
brakes) I stop short! "You Ali?" I ask. He
says "No, me Kurt". Another few hundred
feet, another big blond guy! (Screech) I
ask "You Ali?" again. This time I didn't
even understand what he answered. Another
few hundred feet... Ten of them! Ten! Every
Kraut and Flemish guy on the coast! So I go
call your sister...
Ali is thrown for a loop.
ALI
(uncertain) You kidding?
RICHARD
A little.
SAM
(to Ali) Is he a little crazy?
RICHARD
(to Sam) What? You don't like my truck?
SAM
Yeah I do.
RICHARD
(pretending to be shocked) He doesn't like
my truck!
SAM
I do too like it!
Worked up, Sam shrieks, holding his hands over his ears:
SAM
(screaming) I like your truck!
The road hugs the seashore. Ali watches beaches, homes, a
railway line pass by... Voice over, we hear Richard's
5
distant voice.
Anna empties Sam's Spiderman bag onto the table, spilling
out old, dirty, crumpled clothes.
ANNA
(with a hint of Southern accent) Is this all
you have for him?
Anna Van Versh, Ali's sister, is in her thirties. She is a
huge woman, very tall with a pretty face. She wears
leggings that make her ass look like a workhorse's and a
pair of flip flops. At the bottom of the bag, Anna finds a
passport and opens it. It is Sam's.
6
ANNA
She remembered his passport!
ALI
She didn't remember anything. It was already
in there. She forgot about it, that's all.
When they went to Amsterdam, they'd use the
kid to smuggle dope...
ANNA
You got to be kidding!
ALI
That's what she told me.
Anna shakes her head in disbelief. A beat.
ANNA
How will you tend to the kid? I won't be
able to all the time. I work, and so does
Richard... Was he in school there?
ALI
I don't know.
ANNA
You don't know if your kid's in school?
ALI
Um, no. (turns to Sam) You in school?
No answer. Sam is watching TV.
ANNA
Back at your mom's place, did you go to
school?
SAM
Yes.
ANNA
I can try to enroll him at the school. I'll
see... We also need to get him some clothes.
He can't go like that... I'll ask the
neighbors.
(gives the child her hand) Come with me to
7
the backyard. I have to feed my babies.
In the cluttered basement, Sam is rolled up in a sleeping
bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the
antique Special 50 moped by the light of a flashlight.
Ali wanders through an electronic goods shop, pretending to
be interested in cameras. Through the shop window, he can
see Sam waiting outside in the sun.
The logo is in the shape of a sheriff's badge and hangs
over some filing cabinets on the wall of a modest office:
"ALTA Securite".
OWNER
No criminal record? You never fucked up?
ALI
No.
The boss is in his fifties. He sits behind some files. His
hair is short and white, it looks like he's wearing a
helmet. He is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie.
He stares at Ali.
OWNER
Is that the truth? We'll be checking
anyway...
Ali nods. The owner reaches out.
OWNER
Your papers...
Ali hands him his tattered paper ID. The owner writes down
the number. Ali is 13-14 on the picture.
OWNER
What was your last job?
ALI
I worked in a slaughterhouse. Not for long.
It closed.
OWNER
Ever work in security?
ALI
Yeah. I was a night watchman in a stadium
for 6 months. Working for the city. In a
parking lot too. I did replacements.
12
OWNER
Ever do any combat sports?
ALI
Karate, for 6 years. I even won Junior
Division. And two years of boxing. Thai.
OWNER
You gave it up?
ALI
It was my trainer who gave up.
OWNER
Why?
ALI
He died.
A beat.
OWNER
And how are you physically? You stay in
shape?
ALI
Yeah.
OWNER
You don't smoke?
ALI
No.
OWNER
Drink?
He shakes his head "no". The boss notes something in a
file.
Anna and Sam are waiting outside the office. The owner
kisses Anna on the cheek. He asks how Richard is doing,
then shows them to the door. Anna looks proud to know him.
13
Ali drives. His head seems to touch the roof of the little
Fiat and his thighs are too thick for the seat. He glances
over at Stephanie.
ALI
Still bleeding? Keep your head back. Wait...
He manipulates the knob to push her seat back. He grimaces
in pain.
ALI
Shit!
STEPHANIE
Did you hurt yourself?
He shows her his right wrist.
STEPHANIE
It's swelling up.
He rests his hand on the wheel. After a beat:
ALI
You often go to the Fever?
STEPHANIE
No.
ALI
Why do you go alone?
No answer.
16
ALI
To dance?
STEPHANIE
Yes.
ALI
To find a guy?
She turns and looks down her nose at him:
STEPHANIE
Oh yeah?
ALI
You're dressed like that just for dancing?
STEPHANIE
How am I dressed?
ALI
I don't know... Look.
He points to her skirt, riding up her thighs.
STEPHANIE
Yeah, so what?
ALI
You look like a hooker.
STEPHANIE
Excuse me?
ALI
How would you call it?
STEPHANIE
I don't believe this. Pull over here!
ALI
What?
STEPHANIE
Stop this car on the double!
17
No reaction.
STEPHANIE
It's MY car! If I tell you to stop, you
stop!
Still no reaction, as if she hadn't said a thing. She is
about to scream again, but remains silent, although open-
mouthed. She finally settles back down on the back of her
seat and looks elsewhere.
A beat.
ALI
Dressed like that, it's no surprise that...
STEPHANIE
That's enough now!
They ride in silence.
They enter the apartment. The light is on. Simon comes out
of the bedroom in his boxer shorts and a T-shirt. He's
thirty, blond, and there is something commanding about his
look that could be thought to resemble Stephanie's.
He discovers Ali and the blood stains on Stephanie's T-
SHIRT:
SIMON
What the hell? What's going on?
STEPHANIE
Nothing. A fight...
SIMON
Are you okay?
19
STEPHANIE
Yeah, I'm fine.
SIMON
(pointing to Ali) Who's he?
STEPHANIE
The bouncer from the Fever. He drove me
home.
ALI
(introducing himself)... Ali.
SIMON
The Fever? What the hell were you doing
there?
Ali opens the refrigerator.
SIMON
What are you looking for?
ALI
Ice cubes.
STEPHANIE
He hurt his hand...
Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom.
Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl. Ali's hand in the
bowl. He looks around.
There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back
of a killer whale, Stephanie posing with a group of young
people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo,
Stephanie rising out of the water on Niska's rostrum, etc.
From the nearby bedroom, he hears snatches of Simon's
REPROACHES:
SIMON (OFF)
If you decide to go out, call me. That's
all! Who were you with there?
STEPHANIE (OFF)
Philippe and Christine.
20
SIMON (OFF)
I thought you went out to dinner.
STEPHANIE (OFF)
We decided to go out for a drink after.
SIMON (OFF)
You get my text messages? Why didn't you
answer me?
Stephanie comes back into the kitchen. She has changed her
T-shirt. She seems tense.
STEPHANIE
Feeling better?
ALI
Is that you in the picture with the orcas?
STEPHANIE
Not orcas. Just one orca. Her name is Niska.
ALI
Is that your job?
STEPHANIE
Yep...
Ali nods vaguely admiringly.
ALI
Fuck... I didn't think that...
STEPHANIE
That what? A whore could train whales? Well,
you see...
Simon is at the door. He is wearing a jean.
SIMON
(To Ali) Okay, are you done now? Can you
leave us alone?
Ali stares him down.
21
ALI
You talking to me?
It's as if Ali's calm, peremptory tone suddenly let Simon
know who he was dealing with.
SIMON
Yes, but...
ALI
But what?
SIMON
Nothing, forget it...
In one second, Stephanie sees Simon's face undergo a
metamorphosis, his nervous authority suddenly disappear.
She glances at Ali as if to say Please go now.'
He gets up and wipes his hands on a dish rag.
ALI
Okay, I'm going. So long. (pointing to a
piece of paper on the table) I left you my
number if ever you need it...
She dissolves an aspirin in a toothbrush glass. She checks
her lip in the medicine chest mirror. She notices Simon
watching her from the bathroom doorway.
SIMON
Are you okay? Are you upset?
STEPHANIE
No, I'm not upset.
She drinks the aspirin.
STEPHANIE
I saw your face before...
SIMON
Before?
22
STEPHANIE
With that guy who dropped me off. I saw your
face. I saw how you piped down.
SIMON
I piped down? Me?
STEPHANIE
Yes, you piped down... (pause) Don't tell me
what I should do, how I should live my life.
Don't give me any more orders, Simon.
SIMON
What does that mean?
STEPHANIE
Don't give me any more orders, that's all.
She turns on the faucet and runs her lips under the water.
CUT TO:
Two rooms adjoining the locker room. Two desks, and on the
walls pictures of the trainers with their orcas, laminated
posters of various training methods, files for each animal.
Stephanie is in her diving suit, sitting in front of
Louise, a 23-year-old woman who is reading a document about
her internship.
A trainer leaves the locker room, his backpack slung over
his shoulder.
TRAINER
Coming?
No answer. Tension. He leaves without a word.
Louise looks up. She has been crying. Stephanie looks at
her, impassive. Louise swallows her tears.
LOUISE
Really... this isn't fair.
23
STEPHANIE
No, Louise, there are lots of things you can
say but not that. The pools are my
responsibility and all I care about are the
animals. I have to see to their environment
and that starts with their trainers. Do you
understand?
LOUISE
What are you trying to make me believe, that
I wasn't up to par?
STEPHANIE
No, listen.
LOUISE
Lacking in maturity? Skills?
STEPHANIE
You're not consistent. We've already
discussed that. The foundation of the
relationship with the orcas is stability.
During your internship you've had your ups
and downs. It's not your competence that...
LOUISE
You know this has nothing to do with my
internship. You couldn't care less if I was
competent or not! It has to do with that I
fucked Michael. Just say so.
STEPHANIE
Oh, please...
LOUISE
And in fact what really bothers you is not
that we fucked, but that he told me about
you. How you think you're so... How you've
become such a bitch. That's why you're
firing me. That's what you should write in
your report.
STEPHANIE
Okay, are you done? We can stop here. No
need to spoil the rest of your internship.
Louise stands up.
24
All at once, silence. Then surface noise, but muted by the
cubic meters of water
Underwater shots from pool number 3.
Overhead, the surface shines like a mirror. In pool number
3, a five-ton black shadow bides its time: it is Niska.
Behind the grate in pool number 3, Niska watches her mates
diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles.
A mechanical creak, then the grate slowly begins to lift.
It's about to be her turn.
25
Niska swims into the big pool, slowly at first, but then
picks up speed. She surfaces, disappears for a long beat,
then again reappears, churning up a whirlpool of bubbles.
On the other side of the mirror, the music blares and the
crowd cheers.
What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into
the pool. We recognize Stephanie. She caresses Niska's
rostrum, then kisses it, hanging onto her fins, waltzing
with her up to the surface. Her hands look ridiculously
tiny on the huge black fins. We see her face mirrored in
one of the orca's huge black, gentle eyes. A liquid world
of greens and blues whirls around them.
Now, with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum,
Stephanie has Niska swim around the pool, accelerating the
water pressure and speed. The plastic wall rushes by, a
rush of adrenaline clouds of sediment are lifted as if by
a gust of wind.
A young male, Tom, joins Niska in pool number 1. Niska
immediately rushes him, as if riled by the intrusion, and
flattens him against the plastic wall.
In the shifting reflections at the water's surface, we can
make out Stephanie and two other trainers' faces on the
beach'. Their palms beat on the water, summoning the orcas
for their next number.
Tom gathers some momentum, then shoots around Niska to jump
into first place. He disappears a moment, then is back into
the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning.
Niska then gets into place and takes a running start, but
just as she is about to shoot out of the water, Tom appears
out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him.
We sense chaos up above. Then we see Niska crash back into
the water, with, one after the other, a piece of the huge
video screen that towered over the stage, bits of scenery,
and all kinds of random objects, as if Niska had carried
away half the platform in her wake It all seems to fall
in slow motion, like flecks of snow in a snow globe.
Something sinks toward us a body, floating weightless and
disjointed in a cloud of red.
26
Silence.
The silence of an on-duty nurses' lounge: a table, a
microwave on a mini-fridge, and Louise, standing by the
window sipping coffee.
She is wearing a fleece jacket, her hair messily pulled
back. She hasn't had any sleep.
She hears a scream. She rushes into the corridor.
Chaos. Louise rushes into the room. She finds Stephanie
crawling on the floor, dragging her IVs.
She hesitates, overwhelmed, then calls for help.
LOUISE
Help! Help! Please!
On the linoleum, two stumps stick out of Stephanie's
nightshirt: two thick bandages surround her thighs that
look like two wrapped hams.
STEPHANIE
My legs! What did you do with my legs?
Two nurses arrive.
Stephanie is back in bed, the IVs in her arms. Louise rocks
her gently. Stephanie's eyes struggle against sleep. She
wants to scream again, but doesn't have the strength. She
29
falls asleep in Louise's arms. She feels eight years old.
Black.
A series of scenes, day and night, fade into one another,
always from the same POV.
In the foreground, looking our way, is Stephanie's face
and, behind, the visitors who succeed one another.
Stephanie's eyes are shut.
She opens them:
- The other trainers from Marineland, holding bouquets.
They are silent and look devastated. They occasionally
speak to each other in whispers.
Stephanie closes her eyes.
Black.
Stephanie opens her eyes:
- Louise is seated nearby
LOUISE
I stopped by your place. I saw the cleaning
woman. She didn't want me to pay her. She
was... in shock. She's scared to come here.
She sends her regards.
She closes her eyes.
Black.
She opens them.
- A blonde, pretty woman in her fifties is sitting
behind Stephanie, her face is close to hers. It is her
mother. She speaks with a slight accent.
MOTHER
I spoke to your brothers. They wanted to
talk to you but I didn't think it was the
right time. We'll all come with Hugo during
the next school break... I was afraid I
might lose you. I don't know what I'd have
30
done... It may seem selfish. In any case,
you've always done whatever you wanted. But
this time I was so scared that I don't think
I'll ever be scared again.
Her eyes close.
Black.
Her eyes reopen.
The surgeon and his assistants.
The orthopedist and his assistants.
Her eyes close.
Black.
Her eyes open.
- Simon is there, looking stiff and ill at ease.
He tries not to make any noise as he puts a bunch of keys
on the night stand. He leans over and kisses her hair.
Her eyes close.
Black.
It's her mother again, but this time accompanied by a tall,
uncomfortable looking blond teenage boy. She leans over to
kiss her.
MOTHER
(in German) Hugo wanted to say goodbye to
you. We're leaving tomorrow but we'll pray
for you, honey.
Her eyes remain open.
Black.
Stephanie wakes up with a start in her handicapped bathtub.
She tries to grab the bars but can't find them. She rolls
over on herself like a floating log. She panics.
CUT TO:
There are several rows of parallel bars, with amputees
hanging on to them as they relearn to walk with their
prosthetics. Most of them are old. Nurses help them along.
From her wheelchair, Stephanie watches, looking glum and as
if at a great distance. Her hair is greasy and her face
swollen by her medication and induced sleep.
She looks through the big window that opens onto the
exterior. Outside, amputees smoke and chat. She notices one
group, livelier than the rest. At its center, a guy is
smoking a cigarette he holds in a pincer in the place of
his hand. His name is Gilles.
Four of them are smoking a joint in Gilles' Megane.
Outside, evening is falling over the convalescent center's
parking lot.
Stephanie is sitting up front. She passes the joint to
Gilles, who takes it in his chrome pincer. She notices the
scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth.
There is a couple in the backseat, making out: Raphael (his
arms are missing and his sleeves are pinned up at his
shoulders) and Julia.
GILLES
(to Stephanie) Want me to tell you
something?
32
STEPHANIE

GILLES
You haven't finished mourning, that's all!
STEPHANIE
Really? Mourning who?
GILLES
Your legs.
STEPHANIE
Mourning my legs?
GILLES
Yes.
He sounds as serious as a civics teacher. She looks at him,
incredulous. Raphael sticks his head up front.
RAPHAEL
Pass me the joint...
Gilles' pincer and joint go for Raphael's lips. He takes a
long hit.
GILLES
They were a part of you. When a man dies, he
gets buried. There's a ceremony, a prayer...
Now a piece of you ended up in a hospital
trashcan without a prayer, without any time
for meditation.
A beat. She is dumbstruck. She cannot believe what she's
hearing. In the backseat, Raphael exhales some smoke into
Julia's open mouth.
GILLES (cont'd)
You have to think about it symbolically...
STEPHANIE
Yeah, it's really symbolic...
33
GILLES
I know where my arm is. We buried it under a
nice oak tree behind my house in the
scrubland. My wife and kids came and we
sang...
Stephanie has a fit of the giggles.
GILLES
(a bit vexed) You think I'm kidding?
STEPHANIE
No, it's the grass. I'll stop...
She laughs so hard she cries.
RAPHAEL
Shit, it's a laugh riot up there. (to
Gilles) Can you take us home?
She looks back and, between the seats, notices the girl
toying with Raphael's fly.
GILLES
I'm too beat. I'll take a nap, then go. (to
Stephanie) How are you getting home?
A HyperBrico DIY store in an industrial zone in Cannes. Its
windows shine in the night like an aquarium.
Ali and Kadhi, a huge guard accompanied by a dog, make
their rounds. They open doors with a magnetic key, each
time recording their passage on electronic terminals.
A bit before midnight, someone knocks at the main entrance.
Ali goes to look. It's a guy in a leather jacket and
baseball cap, with a backpack and a shoulder bag.
ALI
What do you want?
34
MARTIAL
To come in.
The guy takes out a card and presses it against the glass
door: it's the business card of ALTA SECU, the security
agency.
ALI
Hey, Kadhi, come here!
Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy.
KADHI
Okay, okay... Are you Martial?
MARTIAL
Yeah.
KADHI
Give me your keys.
ALI
Who's he?
KADHI
It's fine. The boss told me he was coming.
He works for the company.
Ali hands him the bunch of keys.
Ali goes down an aisle looking for something and finally
finds what he was looking for: a folding ladder.
Martial has spread out his material in a stock room at the
back of the store at the end of a corridor formed by
palettes: precision tools, drills, electronic mini-cameras
still in their wrapping, cases equipped with antennae,
packs of batteries... A small radio is playing a night
program on Radio Monte Carlo.
Equipped with a small headlamp, Martial carefully cuts a
hole in a cardboard box with his Leatherman scissors. He
conceals a tiny camera inside.
35
Ali arrives with the ladder over his shoulder.
ALI
Will this do?
MARTIAL
Perfect. Put it down there.
Martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf.
MARTIAL
Imagine you're the manager of a big store
like this and the union reps have been
busting your balls. What do you do?
ALI
Fire them.
MARTIAL
You think that's how it works? What do you
do before you fire them?
He checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole,
then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket
monitor.
MARTIAL
Well, beforehand you try to see how long
they spend in the restroom, if they take
extra-long coffee breaks, smoke on the
premises, steal from the stockroom, rip
customers off with the sales receipts...
When you know all that, you put the pressure
on them and you fire the ones who don't
leave.
Can you give me a stroll down the aisle?
ALI
A stroll?
MARTIAL
Walk down the aisle. No, further down, like
you came out of that door there. Good,
perfect...
Ali twice passes within the camera's field of vision.
Martial climbs down his ladder.
36
MARTIAL
That's it.
ALI
Okay, then I'll be getting back.
MARTIAL
Hold on!
Martial pulls a 10 Euro bill from a jacket pocket.
ALI
It's fine.
MARTIAL
Take it.
Angle on the bill in Ali's hand.
Ali is in the security room reading a kickboxing magazine.
A small radio is playing a late evening program. Outside
in the parking lot, Kadhi smokes while walking his dog. The
dog takes its time. Ali watches Kadhi pull on the leash.
Ali's cell phone rings. The screen reads unknown'.
ALI
Hello?
STEPHANIE (OFF)
It's Stephanie. Remember me? We met at the
Fever.
Ali is taken by surprise.
ALI
Yeah... How are you doing?
She sniggers. Her speech sounds slow and thick.
STEPHANIE (OFF)
You know what happened to me?
37
ALI
Yeah... I saw the papers the news on TV
How are you?
STEPHANIE
(sniggering) How do you think I am?
A beat. Ali is at a loss to answer.
STEPHANIE
How are you?
ALI
Okay... normal.
STEPHANIE
Still a bouncer?
ALI
No, not really.
STEPHANIE
You want to get together?
ALI
Yeah, but nights are tough. I'm a security
guard now. Three nights a week.
STEPHANIE
I'm... crazy busy too. Every day and every
night. I don't know how to manage...
A beat.
STEPHANIE
Now.
ALI
Huh?
STEPHANIE
Come now.
The door opens automatically. He is surprised. He hears a
tired voice from inside.
STEPHANIE (OFF)
Come in.
She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote
control. She activates it and the door closes behind Ali.
Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there
are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T-
shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom
whose legs hang limp.
STEPHANIE
Have you been waiting long?
ALI
No... I just got here.
STEPHANIE
Was that you who rang before?
She looks exhausted but feverish.
ALI
No.
STEPHANIE
Come in. Sit down.
He sits down on a small couch.
STEPHANIE
Want something to drink? A coffee?
39
ALI
Yes.
STEPHANIE
I only have instant.
ALI
That's fine.
It takes two tries to activate the wheels on her
wheelchair.
ALI
Need any help?
She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her
wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen. He sees her pajama
legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap.
ALI
Have you been living here long?
STEPHANIE
I don't know... Three or four months.
ALI
(looking around)... It's nice.
She comes back.
ALI
Are you alone? You got no one to help you?
STEPHANIE
Help me what? Walk?
ALI
No, for the cleaning and everything...
STEPHANIE
Yeah there are people. They come and go.
Hold on.
She manages to navigate from the living room into her
bedroom. He stays in the living room. He hears a kettle
whistle in the kitchen. He goes into the kitchen and pours
water into the glass/mug. He finds her hunched over in her
40
wheelchair. She is nodding off, high on her medication.
ALI
Hey, are you okay?
STEPHANIE
I'm fine.
He opens the window.
STEPHANIE
Does it stink here?
ALI
Yeah, a little.
STEPHANIE
It's me.
He opens the curtains and looks outside. It is getting hot
out. The automatic sprinklers have gone on.
ALI
Let's go out. (No answer) Hey, you hear me?
STEPHANIE
Yes.
ALI
Let's go out.
STEPHANIE
No.
ALI
Get dressed.
STEPHANIE
Leave me alone.
ALI
Where are your clothes?
He opens the closet.
41
A decrepit, simple, functional, but reasonably clean
workout room. Guys of every color work the punching bags,
lift weights, do chin-ups... From the gym next door, we
hear the booming music of an aerobics class.
In a small ring at floor level, Ali and Foued, loaded down
with protective gear, pound each other. Each of their blows
lands right on target. They repeat the same series of moves
several times at varying speeds.
Ali and Foued are dripping wet. They have towels around
their necks. They fill their small plastic bottles at a
faucet in the workout room.
Through a large window in the corridor, Ali watches the
aerobic class going on in the gym: legs and feet moving in
rhythm, red faces, sweaty underarms, butts, boobs and the
braid of the instructor, who uses it to beat the measure,
as she swings it from one shoulder to the other.
FOUED
I have to get back. I need to train.
Ali nods, without actually looking at him.
A cell phone vibrates. Through a narrow transom, a ray of
sun slices through the dark equipment room. They haven't
bothered undressing. Ali and the aerobics instructor are
making love on a pile of workout mats.
Ali's cell phone continues to vibrate, goes silent,
vibrates again. He answers. We hear a crackling voice.
ALI
I'm still at the gym. I'm leaving... I said
I'm leaving!
He hangs up. They continue.
Louise has a set of keys. She enters Stephanie's apartment
with the mail.
47
LOUISE
Steph!
Made up and well-groomed, she looks older than she actually
is.
Stephanie answers from the bathroom.
STEPHANIE (OFF)
I'm in here!
Louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters
the bedroom. Stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom,
her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel.
LOUISE
Shit, you're not ready! The appointment is
in a half hour!
STEPHANIE
It's fine!
LOUISE
What do you mean? You're a freaking pain! I
have to get back to work. Come on, let me
help you.
She grabs the arms of the wheelchair and pushes Stephanie
toward the closet.
STEPHANIE
Let go of me! Stop, I can manage alone.
LOUISE
Oh yeah? Okay, so manage then!
She lets go of the wheelchair and leaves the bedroom.
In CU: the brochures of prosthetic manufacturers we see
pictures of the various models go by.
Stephanie is in the doctor's office with Doctor Vitias. He
is in his fifties and is wearing a white jacket.
VITIAS
We'll order two pairs of prosthetic devices,
one for everyday life and one for the sport
you do.
Stephanie pages through the various brochures.
STEPHANIE
Don't you have something simpler, classier?
VITIAS
What do you mean by classier?
STEPHANIE
I don't know... like a wooden leg with a
piece of rubber at the end?
VITIAS
(smiling) No, sorry. We don't make those
models anymore.
Louise shuts her eyes, visibly exasperated.
STEPHANIE
Or just a plank. A plank with wheels and
straps. And irons to move forward with.
49
LOUISE
(furious) Can you cut it out?
STEPHANIE
What? If I want...
LOUISE
I've had enough of your schtick, you hear
me?
STEPHANIE
Come on...
LOUISE
Shut up!
Stephanie shuts up. Vitias still looks patient as Job.
Sitting on an examination table, Stephanie waits for the
resin bands wrapped around her stumps to dry.
Louise is sitting on a stool across from Stephanie. Their
eyes meet.
STEPHANIE
Go if you want I'll take a taxi.
LOUISE
I told them I was with you.
STEPHANIE
And that works? If you tell them you're with
me, do they let you do what you want?
LOUISE
Well...
STEPHANIE
Cool. If ever you want a day off, just tell
me. I'll write you a note.
Louise looks at her. She's not going to let her get on her
nerves.
There is a knock at the door. A nurse enters.
She checks the resin bands, looks at her watch.
50
NURSE
10 more minutes, just to make sure. Then
Doctor Vitias will come for you.
She smiles and closes the door.
The two young women are again left alone. Stephanie
stretches out her hand. Louise takes it.
And they remain like that.
In close up on the screen of a small DVD player: amateur
images of two bare-chested guys fighting in the garden of a
suburban house. It looks like a wild boxing match, free-
for-all vale tudo in which anything goes.
In the Bricorama security room, Ali, Kadhi and Martial,
excited, are bent over the screen.
A few blows to the face have one of the combatants KO on
the lawn.
KADHI
Look at the next one! Watch how he whacks
him.
A change of scene on the small screen: a courtyard between
two tower blocks, with new combatants, but with the same
amateur images and the same violence.
KADHI
(pointing to the screen)... I know him. I
fought him twice in Nationals. He's not bad.
He was at the boxing club in Marseille.
Martial watches Ali, fascinated by the images, as if he
were sizing him up.
An apartment in a Golfe Juan housing project. After-dinner
time. Kids are playing, women doing the dishes.
On the living room couch, under a tapestry of a lion hunt
in Technicolor, Martial blows on his glass of tea. His
51
cousin is sitting across from him. Ali is on a stool at the
end of the table.
MARTIAL
He says he's done Thai boxing. He can fight.
He's enormous. He's not afraid of taking
punches, and he's white.
COUSIN
I see.
The cousin turns to Ali. He takes his time sizing him up.
COUSIN
Is that true? You like to fight?
ALI
Yeah.
COUSIN
Okay, so I organize the fights. I pick the
fighters. I see if the money's there. I ref.
I collect the dough... I take a third of the
bets. The rest goes to the winner...
MARTIAL
A third of how much?
COUSIN
We don't fight for less than 800.
Ali does the division in his head.
MARTIAL
So?
Ali hesitates.
ALI
(to Martial) There's something I don't get:
how much do you take?
MARTIAL
I don't know. You tell me. How much do you
need? I'll take 20% of what you win. How's
that?
52
ALI
And how much does your cousin give you?
MARTIAL
Oh, I introduced you to him, didn't I? How's
that?
ALI
Okay.
The cousin stands up. They all shake on it.
Ali is in a corner of the living room, sitting in front of
Anna's old PC and watching some fight videos he's found.
Anna rushes into the room.
ANNA
Keep Sam with you for 5 minutes!
She hurries to find some papers in the drawer of a commode.
Ali hasn't budged.
ANNA
Oh! Hear me? I don't want your son in the
garden.
ALI
Yeah, I heard.
He gets up and goes to get Sam who is playing behind the
house. Anna finds her papers and leaves in another
direction.
ALI
Sam! Come here! I want to show you some
stuff!
He lifts Sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer.
ALI
Look how they fight...
He clicks on an image and the fight continues... the
audience's noise as well. Sam watches, intrigued. Ali
53
commentates, pointing to guys onscreen.
ALI
Look at him, in red. See how strong he is?
SAM
Is he the good guy?
ALI
No, he's the bad guy. Look how he tries to
grab his legs. Wait.
His phone vibrates. He takes it from his pocket. It's
Martial. He answers.
ALI
Hello? Yeah...
SAM
Why is the red one the bad guy? Daddy?
ALI
I don't know. Look and tell me who wins.
He turns down the sound, settles Sam on the stool and gets
up to go speak.
ALI
(into the phone) So? What did he say? Which
others? How many?
Sam watches the fight in silence. Dogs bark in the garden.
Sam feels something coming. He looks out the window, then
goes running.
Ali hasn't noticed a thing and continues his phone
conversation.
ALI
What is this bullshit? What do you mean, a
tournament?
Martial is leaning on the bar of a noisy Arab cafe/betting
office, talking into his phone.
54
MARTIAL
Last one standing gets the money. I know,
but he says it's better that way. Do you
think you're in a position to negotiate a
percentage? Where did you get that idea
from? He gave me a website if you want to
see the others.
He takes out a small spiral notebook.
From the living room, Ali hears Sam screaming in the
garden.
ALI
Tell him to give the website to his mother.
All I see is me doing more fights and him
making more dough.
Ali goes to the window.
Outside, near the kennel, Sam has lunged at a guy in a
jumpsuit who is helping Anna get the puppies into a metal
cage. Sam is screaming. Anna tries to take him into her
arms. Sam clutches the bars of the cage. The puppies bark.
Anna finally manages to rip Sam free and drag him back into
the house.
ALI
(into the phone) He's changing the rules and
so am I... I couldn't care less.
Anna storms into the living room. Sam is shrieking, having
a tantrum. He kicks and bites.
ALI
I'm on the phone!
ANNA
What the hell? I asked you to watch him for
5 minutes!
ALI
(into the phone) I'll call you back.
Ali hangs up.
55
Outside, the kennel keeper rolls the cage across the
garden. Anna hugs Sam in her arms.
ANNA
(to Sam) He's taking them to the country.
They'll be so happy there.
SAM
Leave me alone. They're my babies!
Sam refuses to calm down. Anna looks at her brother.
ANNA
What are you doing? Are you his father or
not?
ALI
You're such a pain in the ass.
ANNA
Don't talk to me like that!
Ali rips the child from his sister's grip. Sam struggles.
ALI
Stop it now! I said stop! Calm the fuck
down!
SAM
Let go of me! Let go!
Sam kicks out. Ali shakes him.
ALI
Cut it out, dammit! You're such a pain!
He flings the child away. Sam's head hits the coffee table.
Silence.
Anna rushes over and picks up Sam, who has stopped crying.
He's been knocked out. Anna is frightened. She examines his
scalp, she strokes his head. She trembles. A cut on his
head begins to bleed. She kisses the wound. Ali comes over,
upset.
56
ANNA
Don't touch him! Don't touch him I said! You
know what? You're... you're a bad person.
Huddled against Anna's breasts, Sam opens his eyes.
A narrow road. Down below, a town. The Mercedes Vito with
the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust.
Stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the
overhead strap to avoid hurting herself.
At the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge
homies. They signal Martial to over.
He rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside.
They see Ali and Stephanie in the back.
HOMEBOY 1
Who's she?
MARTIAL
His girlfriend.
Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his
reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial
drives in.
Ali and Stephanie are alone in the car. Through the tinted
windows, they can see a concrete yard with boats dry-docked
around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding
every balcony. Some men are over in one corner,
discussing: Martial, his cousin and some other mean looking
guys.
In the shade, a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans,
is a bare-chested, muscle-bound North African. He warms up,
59
wagging his head from left to right.
ALI
(under his breath) Motherfucker's acting
like he's on Canal Plus.
STEPHANIE
Who are the other guys?
ALI
I don't know. Guys with money. Dealers.
A beat.
STEPHANIE
You okay?
ALI
Great.
Martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into
the passenger seat.
MARTIAL
It's okay. Let's go. Fall against the big
one in black shorts. I told you. They're big
guys.
ALI
Okay. And the bets? How much is there?
MARTIAL
A little over 2000 for the time being. But
it'll go up during the final match.
STEPHANIE
What do I do?
MARTIAL
No girls. Stay in the car. (To Ali) You
ready?
Ali nods.
60
Stephanie watches the faces leaning over the balconies
overhead. She hears the spectators' hostility and cheers.
A circle has formed around the fighters.
She sees the shadow, and only the shadow, of his opponent's
fist barely miss Ali's face.
Then things speed up. Ali uses his feet, knees and fists.
When his opponent begins to totter to one side, Ali hangs
onto him like a pit bull. When he falls, Ali pounds on his
face with his fists and elbows. The ref' has to enlist
Cousin's help to pull Ali away.
Ali returns to his place in the car. Stephanie looks at
him: he can't sit still.
ALI
I have to go.
Another combat begins, while Ali jogs around the hangar.
Stephanie watches other combats, whether featuring Ali or
not.
61
She sees feet dancing on the concrete.
She sees the banknotes in people's hands.
She sees heads leaning over balconies.
She sees an opponent's fist hit Ali behind the ear.
She sees another of Ali's opponents get back to his feet,
and Ali's fist split open his nose like a ripe fig.
She sees another opponent's head bounce off the concrete.
She sees a tooth roll across the concrete, like dice in a
crap game.
She sees Ali perform three steps of a moonwalk and kiss his
own biceps.
CU on a long cut behind Ali's ear. Stephanie's fingers use
a Kleenex instead of cotton.
Bare-chested with a towel around his neck, Ali leans
forward to make his wound more easily accessible.
STEPHANIE
It's nothing, just a cut. (to Martial) Got
anything to disinfect it with?
MARTIAL
(driving) No.
STEPHANIE
(to Ali) Keep this on it. It's the only one
I have.
Ali looks up at her.
ALI
You liked it.
62
STEPHANIE
Yes.
ALI
Me too.
He again lowers his head.
STEPHANIE
Put this on it. It's the only one I have.
Ali straightens up, covers himself with the towel and
remains like that: invisible, out of breath, clearing his
throat and spitting out the window... Stephanie observes
the welts on his body.
A big service station appears a bit farther down the road.
Ali sits back up.
ALI
Pull over here. I'll go rinse off my face.
(puts out his hand) Give me 50.
Martial uses his turn signal.
Behind the wheel of his stopped car, Martial counts the
bills spread out on his lap.
MARTIAL
Have you known him for long?
STEPHANIE
No, not very.
Alone in the back seat, Stephanie looks out at the service
station.
STEPHANIE
What do you want to know? If I knew him
before the accident?
Martial looks back.
63
MARTIAL
What?
STEPHANIE
You find it weird that we're together? You
wonder what he's doing with me?
MARTIAL
No, since you know him, I just wanted to
know if you've seen him like that before?
STEPHANIE
No.
Martial finishes counting the bills.
MARTIAL
He freaks me out.
He takes his share and hands Stephanie the envelope.
MARTIAL
1200 for him.
She looks at the envelope without taking it.
STEPHANIE
Why are you giving me that?
MARTIAL
It's for Ali.
STEPHANIE
Exactly. So why give it to me?
He looks at her, suddenly surprised.
MARTIAL
Hey, you make it complicated. Either you
take it or you don't. And either I talk or I
keep my mouth shut.
He tosses the envelope at her. She looks away. Ali finally
gets back into the car with a big box. It's a toy: a green
John Deere tractor with all the accessories.
64
ALI
For my kid.
STEPHANIE
You have a kid?
ALI
Yep.
A nearby house. Evening is falling. Ali and Jolle make
love in her bedroom. His cell phone rings. The screen
reads: "Stef". He doesn't answer. Jolle comes noisily. Ali
puts his hand over her mouth.
Through the window, we see Sam in Anna's garden, playing
with his new tractor. Richard is hanging towels and swim
suits on the line to dry.
67
Sitting on the couch in a T-shirt and boxers, Stephanie
finishes her dinner, watching TV distractedly.
Balancing on her stumps, she puts her plate in the
dishwasher. Then, supporting herself on her hands, she
leaves the kitchen, wiggling her way into the bedroom. She
lifts herself into bed as best she can.
Evening falls over the bougainvilleas. Stephanie watches
old people coming home in their wheelchairs or hanging on
to their Zimmer frames.
Ali walks up a long standard hotel corridor lined with
numbered doors. He stops and knocks at room 429.
No answer. He knocks again. Finally, room 431 opens behind
him. Martial looks out.
MARTIAL
Hey! I'm here.
ALI
They told me 429.
Martial motions him in.
MARTIAL
Normal. This one is for the equipment.
Boxes of equipment are piled up under the window and the
small table has been converted into a work surface. A
camera is plugged into the TV set. It shows a still
picture: an empty location, one sector of an industrial
site filmed from above.
MARTIAL
I have to watch this. Have a seat.
You wanted to see me.
Ali sits on the edge of the bed. Martial watches the screen
out of the corner of his eye.
68
ALI
I need to find a coach. A real one. Someone
who has me work on my takedowns.
MARTIAL
Foued?
ALI
Foued doesn't know jackshit. Just jiu-jitsu
and rap stuff. You need to ask Cousin. His
guys must train somewhere.
MARTIAL
Think so?
ALI
Yeah. And I'll need some time to train.
MARTIAL
I'll talk with Alta Secu. We'll be able to
work something out.
ALI
Work it out how?
MARTIAL
I'll have my company pay you and I'll bill
them what you cost me. They'll keep paying
you but now you'll work directly for me. You
won't have to spend your nights there.
There is some movement on the screen. He interrupts
himself. Gray silhouettes cross the screen, open a door and
disappear before coming back to cross the screen once
again.
ALI
Where's that?
MARTIAL
At the Mousquetaires.
Martial rewinds and zooms in on some faces.
MARTIAL
I'll make a copy and you'll take it to the
69
owner. Ask for Steve at Security. He'll tell
you what to do.
Sam is on Richard's lap, driving' the truck. He is in
seventh heaven. In front of them, a man is running down the
shoulder of the road.
RICHARD
Look who it is! Go on, honk!
This new gym is large, clean and light. In one corner there
is a genuine ring, and on the other side, a piece of
tatami.
Ali is working out with Joao, a Brazilian in a kimono. They
try out some foot-fist series. On the mat, Ali shadows and
deconstructs Joao's gestures.
They are at the kitchen table, eating salad. Stephanie is
in her wheelchair. Ali has finished his plate.
ALI
Is this all you have?
STEPHANIE
Look in the fridge. There must be some
cheese left.
ALI
You don't have any pate?
STEPHANIE
No, I don't have any pate.
He gets up and opens the fridge. He takes the cheese,
sniffs it, then takes some yoghurt too. He notices a box of
cereal on a shelf and takes it. He returns to the fridge
for some milk. She watches, her mouth open in suspense.
STEPHANIE
You're a good eater, aren't you?
ALI
I'm hungry.
He begins with the cheese.
ALI
No bread?
72
She shakes her head "no" and points to a box of biscuits on
the shelf.
STEPHANIE
There are crackers up there. Do you have a
girlfriend?
He shakes his head.
STEPHANIE
You don't have anyone?
ALI
Yes, but they're not girlfriends.
STEPHANIE
What are they? Quick fucks?
ALI
Yeah.
She hesitates.
STEPHANIE
A lot?
He looks at her.
STEPHANIE
You mind talking about this?
ALI
No, I don't care. (pause) How about you? Did
you have a lot of boyfriends?
STEPHANIE
When, before?
ALI
Yeah.
STEPHANIE
I was with Simon...
ALI
That's all?
73
STEPHANIE
No, there were others. But not a lot either.
I... I wasn't very... In fact, I liked it
when guys looked at me... I liked to feel
that I turned them on... Afterwards, I don't
know... they bored me.
Ali looks at her, strangely attentive, as if he didn't
understand, or didn't believe her.
ALI
And now?
STEPHANIE
Um, nothing. I don't even know what it looks
like anymore... I don't even know if it
still works...
ALI
You don't want to?
STEPHANIE
Did I say I didn't want to anymore? Of
course I still want to...
ALI
How do you go about it?
STEPHANIE
How do you think I go about it? If I were a
guy I'd say I jerk off to a porn video...
I'm a girl.
Ali is dumbstruck.
STEPHANIE
Okay, let's change the subject...
She begins piling up plates and silverware.
ALI
You want to fuck?
She is thrown for a loop.
STEPHANIE
Huh?
74
ALI
You want to know if it still works, so let's
fuck and that way you'll know.
He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous
laugh.
STEPHANIE
Just like that?
ALI
Um, yeah. Give me that.
He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the
dishwasher.
STEPHANIE
I... I don't know if I can like that...
ALI
Whatever you want... You tell me...
She hesitates.
STEPHANIE
Wait.
She wheels herself away from the table and into the
bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table.
ALI
What do I do?
STEPHANIE (OFF)
Wait!
He waits. Then:
STEPHANIE (OFF)
Come here.
He enters the room. The shutters are closed. She is in bed,
under the covers. She watches him sit down on the bed, undo
75
his pants and turn toward her.
ALI
Okay? Ready?
Unsure of herself, she pulls a face.
STEPHANIE
Let's try.
He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her,
but she pushes him away gently.
STEPHANIE
(a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't
kiss?
ALI
No. Your breasts... can I?
STEPHANIE
Yes.
He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering
her. She tries to wriggle herself free.
STEPHANIE
You're crushing me!
ALI
Maybe you should stop talking now...
STEPHANIE
Okay, I'll stop.
His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her
thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets
herself go.
She grabs hold of him.
STEPHANIE
Gently!
76
Ali opens the fridge. He is dressed again. Stephanie
appears in a robe, sitting in her wheelchair. We can tell
she feels too shy to look at him.
ALI
Are you okay? How was it?
She blushes.
ALI
Is it still working?
STEPHANIE
Um, yes... no... I don't really know. It's
different... It's hard to tell after just
one try...
ALI
Yeah but I don't have time right now. I have
to go!
STEPHANIE
(blushing) No, no! That's not what I
meant... I just meant that it's too soon to
tell... like too many things are happening
at once...
Ali doesn't understand.
ALI
But did you enjoy it or not?
STEPHANIE
I did.
A beat.
ALI
When you're up for it and you can't find
anyone, ask me. If I'm oper, we'll do it.
STEPHANIE
What's "oper"?
77
ALI
Operational... If I'm available. If I can, I
mean!
STEPHANIE
If you're "oper" we...
ALI
Yeah.
She sketches a vague gesture.
ALI
What?
Her throat is constricted, she is unable to answer.
STEPHANIE
Nothing. Great.
Stephanie and Louise are out shopping. Stephanie holds
herself up thanks to the shopping cart she is pushing. We
join their conversation already in progress.
STEPHANIE
When I feel like it, I send him a text
message and ask if he's oper. If he is, we
hook up.
Louise reacts.
LOUISE
What's oper?
STEPHANIE
If he's up for it. If he's free. If he is,
we fuck.
LOUISE
Is that all?
STEPHANIE
Yes, that's all. What else do you want?
LOUISE
I don't know. Is that enough?
STEPHANIE
For me it is.
80
LOUISE
What does he do?
Stephanie hesitates a moment, as if worried about how
Louise will react.
STEPHANIE
He fights.
LOUISE
What kind? MMA?
STEPHANIE
No. Illicit fights in the projects.
Louise reacts.
STEPHANIE
Whatever I say, you make a face.
LOUISE
Just give me a second to react... Are you in
love?
She hesitates.
STEPHANIE
He does me good.
Stephanie waves good-bye. They return her wave.
The taxi drives away. The group scatters.
CUT TO:
A dark cellar. We hear Ali and Stephanie labor and sigh. A
door suddenly opens above and we hear voices.
81
ALI
Shit!
STEPHANIE
Who is it?
He looks for his clothes...
Later, Sam guides Stephanie up the narrow stairs of the
house. She has a hard time with her legs' and canes.
A child's room with cheap wall paper depicting dolphins.
Stephanie is sitting on the edge of the bed.
STEPHANIE
So this is where you sleep? It's a nice
room.
Sam nods in agreement. He gives her a strange look.
STEPHANIE
Why are you looking at me like that? Does it
scare you? You want to see them, is that it?
He nods.
She lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis
underneath. Sam looks attentively, stretches out his hand,
touches it carefully.
SAM
Does it hurt?
Stephanie smiles at him.
STEPHANIE
No... Want to touch it?
Sam reaches out his hand.
In CU through the tinted windows of Martial's Mercedes
Vito: the face of a boxer who is lying on the ground and
being pummeled.
Ali is sitting bare-chested in the back seat, a towel
around his neck and a bottle of water between his knees.
84
Ali watches the fight. Sitting next to him, Stephanie fills
a plastic bag with ice cubes. She hands it to him.
STEPHANIE
Here.
He applies it to his eyebrow. She displaces a bloody strand
of hair and replaces it with another.
We see Martial return to the car and open the front door.
MARTIAL
You okay?
He puts a wad of money in the glove compartment.
MARTIAL
You ready?
Ali nods yes'. He opens his door, gets half out and
empties the bottle of water over his head.
Stephanie is left alone in the car. She hears the
spectators' cheers. She closes the window and turns on the
air conditioning full blast.
The car is driving back into town. Martial is driving. The
windows are open. Ali holds a bag of ice against his cheek
bone, while Stephanie applies her Band-Aids to a cut over
his eyebrows. They are talking, but we can not hear what
they say. All we hear is the noise of the wind against the
open windows. Ali suddenly breaks out laughing. Martial
does too in the rear view mirror. Stephanie follows suit
Muzak.
Ali and Martial follow the head of security into the store.
Some of the personnel are near the cash registers, silent,
hostile and immobile. The morning customers wonder what's
happening.
The head of security elbows his way through.
HEAD OF SECURITY
Let them through, please!
The personnel reluctantly make way.
Red graffiti on the wall: "A SPYING BOSS IS A CRIMINAL
BOSS!"
86
Ali recognizes the place with the palettes up to the
ceiling. In the back, he also recognizes the manager,
protected by two guards and being harangued by union
representatives.
MARTIAL
(to Ali, pointing to the manager) Go get the
equipment. I need to see him.
Ali obeys.
UNION REP
Don't bother. We're the ones who will call
the police. The police and the press. That
way they'll know you spy on your workers!
The manager looks away, accompanied by his two guards.
UNION REP
At least have the courage to look at me when
I talk to you!
CUT TO:
The cameras, the ripped out cables, the phony boxes have
been piled up on the floor. It looks more like the crime
squad has been at work. Ali opens a garbage bag and bends
over to retrieve the equipment.
WOMAN (OFF)
What are you doing there?
She's a young employee in the store uniform.
ALI
(suspicious) Packing up.
WOMAN
Is it your stuff?
ALI
No.
He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a
picture.
87
ALI
Don't you take a picture!
WOMAN
You work for them?
She continues to manipulate her phone.
ALI
I said no picture!
WOMAN
Why shouldn't I? You film us!
He straightens up menacingly.
ALI
I'm going to slap you!
A hand grabs his arm. It's Martial.
MARTIAL
Forget it. Let's get out of here!
ALI
And the equipment?
MARTIAL
Forget about it. We're fucked here. The cops
are going to question the managers and the
managers will turn us in.
They leave.
Martial's fingers slowly play with the hair on his chest.
He is lying nude on the bed of his Formule 1 hotel room. He
smokes and stares at the ceiling. His suitcases and bags
are packed, all he has to do is close them.
He hears knocks next door. He gets up with a sigh, pulls on
his pants and opens the door. Stephanie is waiting in front
of room 429.

MARTIAL
In here.
Stephanie looks back, surprised. Martial motions her in.
MARTIAL
I have to go away for work. 3 or 4 months, I
don't know yet... Since Ali wants to keep
fighting, I thought maybe you tend to that
while I'm not here...
She is thunderstruck.
STEPHANIE
Is he okay with that?
MARTIAL
He's the one who asked me to call you.
STEPHANIE
Why me?
MARTIAL
I guess he trusts you.
STEPHANIE
(laughs, thrown for a loop) Yes, sure
but.... I don't know anything about that
scene... I don't know those guys!
He hands her an old spiral notebook.
MARTIAL
I wrote it all down here. As for the rest,
ask me your questions and I'll answer them.
STEPHANIE
How do I do the bets?
MARTIAL
You can count on your fingers, can't you?
STEPHANIE
Honestly, can you see me dealing with those
beasts?
89
MARTIAL
Yeah.
A beat.
MARTIAL
And you need money to cover the bets, and
you have money.
She looks at him.
MARTIAL
What? You're not rich? What did the
insurance company give you for your legs?
200,000? 300,000? Those jobs must have good
health plans. Am I wrong?
STEPHANIE
No.
A shadow crosses Stephanie's mind. She looks at the open
bags and suitcases, without really seeing them. The place
looks like it's expecting a police raid.
STEPHANIE
Where are you going?
MARTIAL
Grenoble, then Vienne.
STEPHANIE
Austria?
MARTIAL
No, in the Isre.
STEPHANIE
Was the insurance money your idea?
MARTIAL
Yes.
A beat. He gives her time to wrap her head around that one.
Then, since she still looks troubled, he taps her on the
hand.
90
MARTIAL
It's me, I said. Don't worry. I'm the bad
guy.
The club is hot as a steam bath. Loud music blares out of
loudspeakers. Bodies dance and eyes shine bright.
At the table "left of the bar": Cousin and three friends
who are with him. Another round of bear hugs and
handshakes. Martial, Stephanie and Cousin regroup face to
face. Martial speaks, Cousin listens and at times looks
over at Stephanie, who looks at him too. She notices one of
the tattoos on his arm: a green and red snake that seems to
be slithering out his sleeve. The barman brings two bottles
of champagne.
Ali leans toward her:
ALI
Want to boogie?
She doesn't understand.
ALI
(loud) You want to dance?
91
She looks frightened, but then smiles when she sees what
he's up to.
ALI
Come on!
STEPHANIE
No, no!
ALI
Whatever you say.
He goes to the dance floor and begins to rock. He dances
badly, clumsily. Martial pours champagne.
We are back inside. Ali is working on a girl a bit farther
off on the dance floor. Stephanie follows Cousin through
the noise and sticky heat. When she next looks at the dance
floor, Ali is no longer there.
Ali and the girl are on their way to the exit. Ali looks
for a friendly face, meets Stephanie's glance and motions
that he's leaving. She waves: "Yeah, ok, I get it."
Ali disappears with the girl.
Stephanie is at the bar, drinking. She types an SMS into
her cell phone: "operational?" She hesitates, then puts
93
away her cell phone. She hadn't noticed a guy sitting next
to her. She also failed to notice that he's been speaking
to her for a while now.
STEPHANIE
(loud) Huh? I can't hear you...
GUY
(loud) No problem. What are you drinking?
STEPHANIE
(loud) Champagne?
The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He
might be thought to resemble Simon.
GUY
What's your name? I'm Pierre.
STEPHANIE
Hey there. I'm Marie.
GUY
Come here often?
Stephanie is on automatic pilot. When she turns to the
room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her. She
can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts
under her T-shirt. She answers his questions, she returns
his smiles. When she finishes her glass and puts it down on
the counter, he kisses her. She doesn't push him away
immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time
to put a good face on it.
STEPHANIE
No... No, please. I don't feel like it. Not
tonight. I can't...
The guy looks disappointed, then manages a good loser's'
smile.
GUY
Okay, no problem...
STEPHANIE
It's best I go. Good night and thanks.
94
He sees her lean over to retrieve her canes and then hobble
away.
GUY
Sorry. I couldn't know.
Stephanie freezes.
STEPHANIE
You couldn't know what?
GUY
Huh?
STEPHANIE
You couldn't know what, asshole?
Foued runs to warn Martial, Khadi and Cousin that something
is wrong.
When Martial arrives, he sees Stephanie collared by a
bouncer three times her size. She lashes out with one of
her canes, while under the bar, another bouncer tries to
help the blond guy back to his feet. There's a deep gash on
his skull.
Cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand.
The buzz of a small electric compressor.
In extreme close up: the needle of a tattoo machine
pricking skin. Ink flows, a cotton swab wipes... a tattoo
slowly appears.
Lying on a table, Stephanie is having what remains of her
legs tattooed.
CUT TO:
99
Stephanie is at a teller's window, withdrawing a rather
large amount of cash.
A machine counts out the bills, while the employee stuffs
wads of them into an envelope.
112. EXT/INT USED CAR DEALERSHIP. DAY
Pennants flap in the wind, the pennants of a used car
dealership.
CU: car doors opening, automatic gearboxes, Stephanie's
"feet" testing pedals, bucket seats, backseats, tinted
windows opening and closing, etc.
A painting of a lion hunt and, under it, Stephanie and
Cousin on a couch, talking shop.
Leaning over a computer and a cell phone, they go over
potential adversaries.
Some kids stick their heads in to see what Stephanie looks
like.
Foued, wearing protective gear, spars with a black
cruiserweight. The fight is close, the sound of flesh on
flesh resounds. Outside the ring, Ali cheers Foued on.
He notices on the other side of the ring a young thin,
bearded guy in a Lacoste polo shirt buttoned up to his neck
- Leonardini - who is following the fight with the eye of a
pro.
When Ali and Joao are later working out on their bit of
tatami, Ali sees Foued sitting on a bench, with a towel
around his neck and talking with Leonardini.
FOUED
He saw me at la Ciotat. We spoke a few times
on the phone. When he has it in for you, he
never lets up. Leonardini is well-known.
100
He was a club in Strasbourg with a training
center. He's taking me on a trial basis for
three months. If it works out, he'll make
challenger in the nationals.
Ali and Foued are off to one side in the locker room.
ALI
So are you going to Strasbourg?
FOUED
What do you think? I'd be an idiot...
ALI
And when are you leaving?
Leonardini enters the locker room.
FOUED
Mr. Leonardini, this is my buddy Ali. Ali
Van Versh.
Leonardini shakes his hand.
ALI
Pleased to meet you.
CU: a black and red arrow with, in industrial characters:
"RIGHT".
It's the tattoo on Stephanie's right thigh. Ali's hand
grips and squeezes the thigh. They are making love.
The room is half-lit. Ali growls and grinds his teeth in
his sleep. Stephanie slowly and noiselessly rolls over to
her side of the bed. She gets up and, using her hands,
drags herself toward the bathroom.
Suddenly, feeling like he's suffocating, Ali awakens. It
takes a few seconds for him to realize where he is. His
hand sweeps across the bed.
ALI
Where are you?
STEPHANIE (OFF)
Here.
He sits up. She is embarrassed.
STEPHANIE
No, don't look!
ALI
What are you doing?
STEPHANIE
I'm going to pee.
ALI
Is it early?
STEPHANIE
Five.
102
ALI
Shit, I collapsed...
Ali slips out of bed, naked, yawning and groggy. He comes
and leans over her...
STEPHANIE
I don't like it when you see me like this...
ALI
Hold on.
She hangs onto his neck. He lifts her up and, both naked,
he carries her into the bathroom.
Stephanie is sitting on the toilet, while Ali pees in the
shower.
STEPHANIE
I called the numbers they gave me at the
gym. I spoke to an organizer, Gnther Bower.
She yawns.
STEPHANIE
There's a gala in Turin next week. He told
me that we'd have time to meet there. I'm
going to go.
ALI
Yeah. And when do I see him?
STEPHANIE
Later, in his gym in Dortmund. He wants to
organize a test match, to see what you're
worth. To see if you've got the "Gttlicher
Zorn""...
Ali comes out of the shower.
STEPHANIE
Turn on the water.
103
ALI
Huh?
STEPHANIE
Turn on the water when you pee. It's
disgusting.
He runs some water.
He carries her back into the bedroom. She looks at his
face, the scar on his forehead, the scar over his nose.
STEPHANIE
How's your nose?
ALI
Mm.
STEPHANIE
It doesn't seem broken.
ALI
No.
They look at each other.
He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her.
Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places
her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving.
She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock.
She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away,
surprised.
ALI
Now we're allowed?
No answer.
They make love.
In CU: the tattoo on Stephanie's left thigh. A red and
black arrow with, in industrial characters: "LEFT".
Music.
104
The road speeds by. Sun. Road signs with the names of
Italian cities. The landscape has changed.
Wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses, Stephanie drives
with her elbow out the window. On the radio, we hear the
voice of an Italian DJ.
A standard hotel lobby.
Curious, Stephanie looks at the crowd of fighters the day
before the Ultimate' tournament: muscle-bound giants
squeezed into tight jackets, with bashed in eyebrows,
collapsed nostrils, cauliflower ears...
Every language can be heard, some greet each other, some
hug, they all size each other up...
CUT TO:
Propped up on her cane, she heads for a table in a corner
of the bar where a man is consulting his cell phone.
STEPHANIE
(in German) Mr. Bower?
GNTHER
(in German) Yes?
STEPHANIE
(in German) I'm Stephanie Granget.
Gnther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of
those years in the ring.
CUT TO:
105
Settled in a corner in front of their open PCs, Stephanie
and Gnther talk shop.
CUT TO:
They are about to separate.
STEPHANIE
(in German) Can you get me a ticket for
tonight?
GNTHER
(in German) I don't know. I'll see what I
can do. (pointing to her legs) What happened
to your legs?
STEPHANIE
An accident. In another life. I was an
animal trainer. I worked with orcas... The
show took a turn for the worse.
GNTHER
(it dawns on him) Oh, of course! In France!
The accident! It was you?! I'm talking to a
star!
Stephanie makes a face.
GNTHER
Yes, I am... Amazing. What courage! Bravo!
I'm very honored, really. I was an idiot
before!
STEPHANIE
Why?
GNTHER
I acted like an arrogant business man. I'm
so ashamed. Will you forgive me?
STEPHANIE
Of course, Mr. Bower.
GNTHER
Call me Gnther. Of course you can come
tonight. As my guest!
106
Bleachers have been set up in a gym, surrounding a cage-
like, fenced-in ring. Inside, combatants fight, no rules,
no holds barred.
On the floor, two wrestlers clasp and elbow each other.
One is bleeding from the forehead.
Below the ring, Stephanie is mesmerized by this carnival of
violence.
Gnther leans toward her:
GNTHER
(in German) Funny, huh?
STEPHANIE
(in German) What? That?
GNTHER
That... and you!
Stephanie walks down a corridor. She stops in front of a
door and knocks. Gnther opens. He looks surprised. He is
barefoot, in a pair of trousers and an unbuttoned shirt.
He looks at her inquisitively, and when she still doesn't
SAY ANYTHING:
GNTHER (in German)
Are you okay? Do you need anything?
She hesitates.
STEPHANIE (in German)
I... I came to see if I got it wrong, or
not.
He knits his brow.
GNTHER (in German)
Got what wrong?
STEPHANIE (in German)
You don't understand?
107
GNTHER (in German)
Excuse me?
STEPHANIE (in German)
I got the impression, the way you were
looking at me before... Try to understand
because this is getting hard for me...
GNTHER (in German)
No, you didn't get it wrong.
He smiles and opens the door.
GNTHER (in German)
I have someone in my life, you know.
STEPHANIE
So do I.
He draws her inside. The door closes.
Anna is about to open her cash register, when a West Indian
in a security uniform whispers into her ear, apparently
asking her to follow him. Another cashier is already
waiting to take her place.
Anna joins three other employees waiting in a corridor.
They exchange a few words under their breath.
Anna comes out of an office, looking distraught. She has to
lean against the wall to hold herself up. A colleague comes
to help.
COLLEAGUE
So?
ANNA
I got fired.
COLLEAGUE
Come on. There's something we want to show
you.
108
In the locker room, we recognize the girl who had
photographed Ali while he was trying to reclaim Martial's
camera equipment. The girl says something to Anna. When it
seems that Anna can not believe her ears, the girl takes
out her cell phone and confronts her with the evidence.
Anna needs to sit down.
In the kitchen, Anna and Richard are sitting at the table
in front of a meal they haven't had the appetite to start.
ALI
You okay?
No answer.
ALI
You don't seem it.
He goes to open the fridge.
ANNA
What are you doing?
ALI
I'm hungry.
ANNA
Close it! Don't eat here.
Ali stares at her, stunned.
ANNA
Don't eat here.
ALI
What the hell is going on?
ANNA
I was fired this morning. I'm unemployed.
109
ALI
Shit... But what's the problem if I eat
here?
Anna stands up.
ANNA
They had cameras in the storeroom... They
filmed us when we took the expired food.
They fired us.
Ali's head spins.
ANNA
You had your sister fired. How does it feel?
How much did you get for that? You get paid
per person or a flat rate? Nothing to say? I
take you in, I take care of your son and you
have nothing to say?
ALI
I couldn't know...
ANNA
You couldn't know? You couldn't know what?
That you were screwing us out of jobs? That
you were hurting people?
Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand
delivers a resounding slap.
He takes it like a man. A moment passes. Ali is red from
the slap, red with shame until he suddenly straightens up
and knocks over the table.
RICHARD
Calm down. Calm down, I said!
Ali looks back. He sees Richard's grim face at the other
end of a hunting rifle.
RICHARD
Take your stuff and get out of here. We
don't want to see you around here anymore.
110
A sudden noise draws their attention: Sam is watching from
the top of the stairs.
ANNA
Go to your room. Go upstairs immediately.
An SMS arrives from Stephanie: Almost there. I miss you.
Ali is lying on his mattress. He puts down the phone. He
hears Anna and Richard's voices upstairs. He sits up and
begins to stuff things into a bag.
A new message arrives: I'm home. Oper? Ali hesitates,
then turns off his phone and clicks his bag closed.
Night has fallen. Sam's nose is stuck to his bedroom
window. He sees his aunt sitting at the plastic table in
the garden downstairs with her face in her hands.
A door slams. Sam rushes to the bathroom window. He sees
his father stomp down the street, never once looking back.
Sam remains glued to the window pane.
Ali's silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight
before again disappearing into the dark. Sam watches him
for as far as he can.
Fade to black.
In the half-light of the basement, a rectangle of light has
formed where the door opens onto the street. Stephanie
looks over Ali's mess: his magazines, body building
equipment, dirty T-shirts, track suits hanging over a
trestle...
Anna is standing against the light at the door and, a bit
farther off, Sam is sitting on the stairs watching them.
ANNA
In his message he said he was in Strasbourg.
No news since. I don't know what he's doing
111
there, or even if he's still there. Has he
called you?
She shakes her head "no".
ANNA
Did you try the gym?
STEPHANIE
Yeah. They don't know.
ANNA
If I had an address or a number, I'd give it
to you... Even if I think it's dumb. Do you
believe me?
STEPHANIE
Yes.
ANNA
After what he did to me...
Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door. She's about to
leave.
ANNA
He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck
about anything. All he ever cared about was
himself. He's totally selfish.
Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light.
STEPHANIE (OFF)
You don't know him.
ANNA (OFF)
Me? What did you expect with him?
STEPHANIE (OFF)
I don't know. Not this.
Fade to black.
Black.
112
A ring has been set up in the middle of the gym. A few guys
have gathered round to watch Ali rhythmically pound on his
trainer's bear-like paws.
Leonardini sets the pace.
LEONARDINI
1,2... 1,2,3,4... Faster! 1,2,3. Yes.
Faster! Move! You're stepping back!
Ali pounds harder and harder. He times his respiration to
match the movement of his fists.
Young athletes, some tall, some short, some heavyset, some
not, are sitting on refectory chairs to watch TV. Ali does
too. His hair is cut short and his face is closely shaven.
He looks younger. He could be a student.
Through the window, Ali sees a twelve-ton Scania pull to a
stop at the entrance to the parking lot and beep its horn.
Ali runs out to meet it.
Leaning against the window of the Intensive Care Unit, Ali
sees Sam's nude, tiny body being worked on by doctors...
his skin is blue from the cold... there is a tube in his
mouth... his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a
respirator... his mouth spits out brackish water
brutally...
A door opens and a nurse appears. Ali straightens up.
NURSE
We'll take care of you. Come with me.
He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his
hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred
fingers, his broken, bloodied hands.
118
Sam is lying in a hospital bed. His eyes are closed and
coils of tubes attach him to control apparatus.
Ali is at his side. His hands are now wrapped in thick
bandages. The disinfectant makes him look like he is
wearing yellow gloves halfway up his arms.
Richard is standing behind him, near the window.
Ali takes Sam's fingers, places them in the palm of his
bandaged hand and looks at them.
Sam's eyes begin to dart wildly under his eyelids... his
fingers quiver... his eyes open.
There are not many people in the corridor at this late
hour. Richard is bent over a coffee machine. A cup slowly
fills up. Farther off, Ali is KO, leaning against a wall.
Richard brings him a coffee. Ali takes it clumsily into his
damaged hands.
Richard's cell phone rings. He moves away to answer and
speaks into it softly. A few moments later, he returns to
Ali and hands him the phone.
RICHARD
Here. She wants to talk to you.
ALI
Anna?
Richard shakes his head.
ALI
Hello?
STEPHANIE (OFF)
It's me. (pause) Do you mind?
ALI
No.
119
STEPHANIE
How is he?
ALI
Okay. He woke up an hour ago.
STEPHANIE
Is he injured?
ALI
No, I don't think so.
STEPHANIE
And how are you?
ALI
I fucked up my hands on the ice.
STEPHANIE
Is it serious?
ALI
They're broken.
A beat.
ALI
How are you?
STEPHANIE
I'm okay.
ALI
What are you up to?
STEPHANIE
You mean in general? In my life?
ALI
I wanted to say that...
STEPHANIE
I'm not asking for anything. I'll be going.
I'll call you back to see how Sam's doing.
Give him a kiss him from me...
120
ALI
Don't hang up.
STEPHANIE
ALI
Don't hang up!
STEPHANIE
I won't hang up...
ALI
He was in a coma for 3 hours... Three
hours... For three hours he was dead... I
was scared to lose him.
His eyes well with tears.
ALI
Don't leave me.
STEPHANIE
I won't leave you.
Black.
ALI
I love you.
A child sleeps.
His eyes are darting under his eyelids: vestiges of light
and shadow, of noise.
Sam opens his eyes: he is in a hotel room. At the foot of
the bed, a TV with the sound turned down low is
broadcasting a cartoon of mice fighting in Polish.
Stephanie comes and goes, picking up things littering the
floor and packing their bags.
Over these images, we hear Ali's voice:
The human hand contains 27 bones. Some
monkeys have more: gorillas have 32, five in
121
each thumb. For humans, it's 27.
If you break an arm or a leg, after a while
calcium gathers around the bone and joins it
together. In the end, it's stronger than
before. But if you break a bone in your
hand, you know it'll never fully heal.
You'll think about it before every fight.
You'll pay attention... And even if you pay
attention, the pain will come back... like
needles, like broken glass...
Ali is wearing a T-shirt. He still bears the marks of
yesterday's fight. His eyebrows and hands are bandaged.
ALI
Wake up, kiddo. It's over. We're going home.
SAM
Did you win?
He smiles and kisses his biceps.
The lobby of a Holiday Inn, the day after an Ultimate
tournament... (much the same ambience as in Turin) The
fighters, winners and losers, are about to leave. They
greet each other, pose for photographers, answer
interviewers, sign autographs... Ali's hands are still
bandaged. He is being interviewed along with a kind of
Viking with a closed eye and broken arm.
Ali goes to join Stephanie and Sam outside the hotel, where
a taxi driver is loading their luggage. A young Polish fan
calls out: "Ali! Ali!" He wants a photo.
Ali lifts Sam into his arms and pulls Stephanie closer.
They pose.
