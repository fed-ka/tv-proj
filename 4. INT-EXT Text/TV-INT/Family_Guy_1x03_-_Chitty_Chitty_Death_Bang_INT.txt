                It's a box of One Dollar Rice!

  An ELDERLY MODEL in an evening gown waves a shaky, flabby arm 
  over a box clearly marked "ONE DOLLAR RICE." Bob Barker turns 
  to his panel of contestants.

                What is your bid, Linda?

  The AUDIENCE shouts out numbers, as well as "Baba Booey" and 
  "Freebird!" An ATTRACTIVE ASIAN LADY is the first contestant.

  Lois dumps some apple sauce in a bowl. She sprinkles cinnamon 
  on it as Stewie watches, suspicious. She brings the bowl over 
  to him.

                                  STEWIE

                I saw that! You put something in 

                there!

  He pushes it on the floor. Lois goes to clean it up.

  He flips to the back of the book. Suddenly the room is bathed 
  in a flashing red light. A siren sounds. Peter closes the

  wings). The sperm begin firing lasers at the large egg, which

  Stewie deliberately blasts a few of his competitors out of 
  the "sky", and flies in toward the egg. The battle continues

  A young, pleasant MANAGER comes over to Peter.

                                    MANAGER

                Welcome to Cheesie Charlie's. Are you 

                here for an affair?

                                    MANAGER

                Yes, Mr. Griffin. We're really looking 

                forward to Stewie's birthday party.

                                  PETER

                Yeah, I bet you are. Now, exactly what 

                am I gettin' for my money?

                                    MANAGER

                Well, our party packages include 

                  everything, even a visit from Cheesie 

                Charlie himself.

                                  PETER

                Well, let's say you knock off fifty 

                bucks and we get a less popular 

                  character. Like that elephant from 

                Horton Hears A Ho.


  HORTON the elephant lies on the bed reading a book. The CAT 
  IN THE HAT sits at the table.  The faint sound of a creaking 
  bed is heard from the next room. Horton perks up a bit and 
  puts his ear to the wall.

                                  HORTON

                Hey.

                  a common, everyday simpleton here.

  Peter absently pulls a plastic ball from the crack of his ass 
  and tosses it aside. We hear it bounce away.

                                  PETER (CONT'D)

                I'll just take my business elsewhere.

                Why yes, I made them from scratch.

                Meg, you didn't tell me your mother

                                  MEG

                She said it's a once in a lifetime 

                event!

                Well, so is your little brother's 

                first birthday.

  Brian enters and opens the refrigerator.

                                  MEG

                Stewie won't care if I miss it.

                                  LOIS

                Of course, he will. And so will I. 

                You'll be invited to other parties.

                                  MEG

                Yeah, like that New Year's Eve party 

                at the Insane Asylum?


  Meg looks bored as a bunch of mental patients in party hats 
  count down to midnight.

                                  PATIENTS

                Ten! Nine! Six! Chair! Milk! Blue!

                You see the rabbit, don't you?

                                  PETER

                Heya, Lois. I got something to tell 

                you...

                                  LOIS

                Just a second, Peter.

  As she speaks, Stewie, wearing his backpack, uses suction 
  grips on his hands and shoes to climb down the side of the 
  house. As he passes the window, we hear the muffled popping 
  sounds as the suction cups stick and release. Only Brian 
  notices this. He shrugs and goes back to perusing the fridge.

                                  LOIS (CONT'D)

                Meg, this party is important to me. My 

                little baby is turning one.

  Stewie's last suction cup pops off and he falls out of frame 
  with a crash.

                                  STEWIE (O.S.)

                Aahh!

                  (OBLIVIOUS) Look, I've been planning 

                this day since my ultrasound. Now our

  Peter reacts to this.

                It's not safe. I mean, kids disappear 

                from that place like silverware.

                Well, I think this could work out

  Peter stands, in front of the copy machine as it flashes and 
  copies.

  ANGLE ON THE OUTPUT TRAY -- The machine cranks out page after 
  page of xeroxed coins.


                                  PETER

                Then I went on a game show.


  Peter and two other contestants listen to Alex Trebek read 
  the answer.FAMILY GUY  -  "CHITTY CHITTY DEATH BANG" (TABLE DRAFT) 8/20/98       30.

                For eight hundred dollars, "This 

                chemical dye is used in over ninety 

                percent of all cosmetics."

  Peter buzzes in.

                                  PETER

                  Diarrhea!

  Everyone laughs. Peter looks confused.

                                  PETER (CONT'D)

                What? (REALIZING) Oh, sorry. What is 

                  diarrhea.


                                  BRIAN

                So how did you get the money?

                                  PETER

                The old-fashioned way. I earned it.


  Dozens of purring cats in cages fill the garage.

                                  PETER

                Okay, which one of you is Fluffy? 

                You're goin' home.


                                  PETER

                Now I can afford to give Stewie the 

                party Lois always dreamed of.FAMILY GUY  -  "CHITTY CHITTY DEATH BANG" (TABLE DRAFT) 8/20/98       31.                         


                                  BRIAN

                I don't know, Peter. If I heard Lois 

                  correctly, she just wants a party with 

                her family and... Hold it.

  A beat later, a tiny chuck wagon pulled by a team of tiny 
  horses tears through the kitchen.

                                  CHUCK WAGON DRIVER

                Yah! Yah!

  Brian tears after the chuck wagon, but it disappears through 
  a cabinet door. Brian opens the cabinet and there's just a 
  bag of dog food.

                                  BRIAN

                Someday.


  The kindly Security Guard is kneeling by Stewie, who is 
  sitting in a chair as if he's being interrogated.

                                  SECURITY GUARD

                Do you know your phone number, little 

                boy?

                You won't get me to talk. Not even 

                with cold running water, jumper 

                cables, and a car battery!

                                  SECURITY GUARD

                Sounds like you don't want to go home.

                                  SECURITY GUARD

                Y'know son, runnin' away never solves 

                  anything. You're getting to be a big 

                boy now, and part of growin' up means 

                facin' your problems head-on.

                                  STEWIE

                  (CONSIDERS THIS) Hmm. The ruptured 

                  capillaries in your nose belie the 

                clarity of your wisdom. It seems the 

                answer to my dilemma lies not in some 

                war-torn third-world republic, but 

                deep within myself. I will face this 

                  "professional" who tasks me. And as 

                for you, kind sage, I only hope my,

                you spend the next ten years IN FROZEN 

                  CARBONITE!

  Stewie draws a device and fires, freezing the Security Guard 
  solid.


  MUSIC: "THIS IS THE END" (BY THE DOORS)

  Stewie is in just his diaper and a Care Bears headband. He 
  mentally prepares for the battle ahead, doing a kata (a 
  series of fluid martial arts poses) a la Martin Sheen in 
    APOCALYPSE NOW. He then grabs two baby bottles, quickly ties 
  the nipples together, then expertly flings them about like 
    nunchakus.


  Meg is with Jennifer and her new friends. All of them are 
    clean-cut, smiling teenagers with really short hair who are 
  unusually peppy and wearing identical dark blue jogging suits 
  and tennis shoes. In the center of the room there's a large 
  punch bowl.

                                  JENNIFER

                I'm so glad you could join us, Meg. 

                We re gonna have a great time on our 

                trip.

                A trip? Like to the beach? Because I 

                didn't bring my bathing suit...

  Meg smiles and moves away. She doesn't see Jennifer as she 
  pours rat poison, anti-freeze, rusty nails, broken glass, a 
  rabid dog, and a book into the punch bowl. HOLD ON THE PUNCH 
  BOWL: The book floats on top of the punch. It reads, "Paul

  Lois is on her bed, wiping her eyes, sadly. Peter paces, 
  agitated.

                                  PETER

                C'mon, Lois, I hate to see ya cry. We 

                got animals, we got a clown... I mean, 

                a party couldn't be any better if 

                Jesus himself showed up.


  A party is in progress. JESUS is the center of attention. 
  He's holding a pitcher of water.

                                  JESUS

                Okay, everybody, for my next miracle, 

                I'm going to turn water into funk!FAMILY GUY  -  "CHITTY CHITTY DEATH BANG" (TABLE DRAFT) 8/20/98       40.                         


  Jesus snaps his fingers and there's a puff of smoke. Suddenly 
  the room is brightly colored, with 70's-style disco lights, a 
  flashing floor, and funkadelic music. Everybody starts doing 
  the same funky dance moves. Jesus, still in his robe, now 
  sports an Afro and leaps into a jazz split.


                                  PETER

                I don't get it. I mean, I'm sorry I 

                let Meg go to another party, but 

                c'mon, it's Stewie's birthday, not 

                yours. (UH-OH) Is it?

                                  LOIS

                Peter, we're celebrating the day our 

                family became whole.

                                  PETER

                Huh. I never thought about it like 

                that.

                                  LOIS

                If I never accomplish anything else in 

                my life, I can always be proud that I 

                brought three healthy, normal children 

                into this world.


  Stewie, now full-term, is very cramped.

                                  STEWIE (V.O.)

                The prison cell had become smaller and 

                smaller as the days passed. My only 

                means of retaliation were my impotent 

                kicks.

  Stewie kicks.

                                  STEWIE (V.O.) (CONT D)

                I could hear my captors mocking me.

                  (MUFFLED) Oh, my, he's a feisty one.

  The soft impression of Peter's face appears inches from 
  Stewie's.

                                  PETER (O.S.)

                                  STEWIE (V.O.)

                I was quite sure that soon I would be 

                dead.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:FAMILY GUY  -  "CHITTY CHITTY DEATH BANG" (TABLE DRAFT) 8/20/98       42.                         



  STEWIE'S P.O.V.: - Light streams in as the walls of the cell 
  part. Stewie starts toward the opening.

                                  STEWIE (V.O.)

                And then, without warning, there was a 

                light at the end of the tunnel. I took 

                  advantage of the opening. Free at 

                last!


  STEWIE'S P.O.V.: -- The screen parts, revealing a bright 
  white light. Suddenly a man's face (the DOCTOR) appears in 
  the screen. He wears white scrubs.

                                  STEWIE (V.O.)

                But suddenly, I was seized by a 

                  mysterious Man in White!

                really like that guy over there, but 

                he doesn't even know I exist. He must 

                think I'm like a total dog.

                                  JENNIFER

                Oh, that's so not true! You look

  passenger seat.

  We hear a large gong sound. The kids all reverently turn to a 
  large door. Jennifer leans over to Meg.

                  (TOUCHED) You did all that?

                                  PETER

                Hell, no, not me. But her mom did. (TO 

                MEG) She's always doin' stuff for me 

                and you kids. That s why when she asks 

                us to do something, we should do it.

                                  MEG

                I know, but it s just Stewie's 

                  birthday. Why does she care if I'm 

                there?

                                  PETER

                I don't know... Maybe, it s kind of 

                like her birthday, too. Once a year 

                for each of you, your mom gets to 

                remember the day you came into her 

                life.

                                  MEG

                (TEARING UP) I'm the worst daughter 

                ever!

                                  PETER

                No, you're not, honey. What about that 

                fat girl from the Judds?

                                  MEG

                I've been so selfish. After all mom's 

                done for me.

                I miss my mom.

                                  CULT KIDS

                Yeah./ Me, too./ I still hate my Dad, 

                though.

                                  JENNIFER

                Gee, Mr. G., you're right.

                                  CULT KID #2

                Mr. Griffin, could we come to Stewie's 

                party, too?

                                  PETER

                Sure. You're all invited.

                                  JENNIFER

                Meg, you have the coolest family.

  Peter picks up a glass of punch and raises it.

                                  PETER

                She sure does. Hey, here's to family!

                                  CULT KIDS

                To family!

  They all drink the punch. Peter lifts his glass but glances 
  at his watch, spilling the punch.

                                  PETER

                Oh, jeez, look at the time. C'mon!

  He grabs Meg just as she's about to sip her drink, spilling 
  it. They head out the door..


  The leader comes in carrying a dark blue jogging suit.

                                  CULT LEADER

                  Children, the time of ascension has 

                  arrived...

  The Cult Leader looks down and sees his dead followers on the 
  floor (and out of frame), then the half-empty punch bowl.

                                  CULT LEADER (CONT D)

                Oh, for the love of... Haven't any of 

                you been in a cult before?

  He crosses to the doorway and sees Peter and Meg drive off.

                                  CULT LEADER (CONT'D)

                No! I can't achieve transcendence by 

                myself! That would just make me some 

                kind of lone nut. Come back, Meg!

  He starts out, then stops.

                                  CULT LEADER (CONT D)

                Whoops, can't forget my ceremonial 

                white robe.

  He grabs a white robe off the coat rack by the door. It looks 
  uncannily similar to what the doctor was wearing in Stewie's 
  birth flashback.FAMILY GUY  -  "CHITTY CHITTY DEATH BANG" (TABLE DRAFT) 8/20/98       52.                         



  The Cult Leader walks in the hall. The place is eerily quiet. 
  He hears a scampering behind him and whirls, but nothing's 
  there.

                                  CULT LEADER

                Is anybody home?

  The door slams shut behind him.

                                  CULT LEADER (CONT'D)

                Aaah!

  Stewie's voice is amplified - - it sounds as if it's coming 
  from all around.

                                  STEWIE (V.O.)

                  (AMPLIFIED & FILTERED) Greetings, Man 

                in White. I've been expecting you.

                                  CULT LEADER

                (SCARED) Who said that?

                                  STEWIE (V.O.)

                  (AMPLIFIED & FILTERED) Peek-a-boo, I 

                see you!

  The Cult Leader turns toward the living room and spots a 
  partially open closet door with a mirror on it.

                                  STEWIE (V.O.) (CONT D)

                  (AMPLIFIED & FILTERED) You're getting 

                warmer!

  The Cult Leader moves towards the closet door, then throws it 
  open! It's just a baby monitor.

                do you want?

                I want to get the hell out of here.

                                  STEWIE (V.O.)

                  (AMPLIFIED & FILTERED) I'm sorry, 

                we're fresh out of that. I'm afraid 

                all we have left is untimely death!

  The Cult Leader hears a noise behind him. He whirls around -- 
  no one's there. He turns back and closes the closet door. We 
  see in the mirror that Stewie's standing right behind him! He 
  wields a strange looking laser-sighted raybeam. The Cult 
  Leader spins around to face him.
