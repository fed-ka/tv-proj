      SHE STARTS TO WALK OVER, THEN, NOTICES, BEHIND HIM, A NOT SO 
      CUTE CREEP, CLEARLY LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.  SHE SIGHS.

                                  JULES

                ...Then we had sex, fell asleep and 

                when I woke up this morning he was 

                gone.  

                                  ANDI

                So what you re saying is... you may or 

                may not be engaged?

                                  JULES

                Right!  (TO BOBBY) You have to find 

                out.  

                                  BOBBY

                Me?  How am I supposed to find out?

                                  JULES

                When you guys hang out.

                                  BOBBY

                When are we  hanging out? 

                                  JULES

                Soon.  Remember, Lowell said,  we 

                should hang out soon  and you said, 

                   absolutely.       Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    24.


                                  ANDI

                  Actually, you said  absosmurfly,  

                which was so weird.   

                                  BOBBY

                The guy makes me nervous.

                                  JULES

                Lowell s free tomorrow night.  

                                  ANDI

                Will you go?

      BOBBY THINKS.  SIGHS.  

                                  BOBBY

                Can it count as your anniversary 

                present?

                                  ANDI

                Your romance knows no bounds.  (THEN 

                TO JULES) And you have to tell Kate. 

                                  JULES

                I know.  (THEN) Why do I?

                                  ANDI

                Because.  She s one of your best 

                friends.  

                                  JULES

                I know.  But I m scared of her.  

                                  BOBBY

                Oh my God, me, too!  She s terrifying!  

                How have we never discussed this in 

                twelve years?       Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    25.


                                  ANDI

                Think of it this way: would you rather 

                she find out on her own?  

      AS JULES AND BOBBY CONSIDER JUST HOW SCARY THAT WOULD BE, THE 
      DOOR BURSTS OPEN.  IT S WILL.

                                  WILL

                Hey, what s everyone doing Saturday 

                night?  

                                  ANDI

                Watching Dance Moms and eating an 

                entire Pavillions cake after Bobby 

                goes to bed.  

                                  WILL

                Well, cancel that,  cause I m having a 

                party.  

                                  BOBBY

                What?  You hate parties.  

                                  WILL

                I know, I know, but, well... (TO 

                JULES) I thought about what you said 

                and maybe I could be a little more 

                  positive.  So I started thinking about 

                the upside to not being married and it 

                turns out, there s a lot.

                I don t have to organize Kim s 

                iPhotos, or spend the better part of a 

                weekend trying to teach her parents 

                how to do e-mail, or live in a shoe-

                free home because she spent a semester 

                in Japan.  I ve been wallowing when I 

                should have been celebrating.  

                                  JULES

                This is amazing, Will!  A party will 

                be so healing.  We can bury your 

                marriage license, make a list of 

                things you want to manifest in your 

                next relationship, read excerpts from 

                  spiritual masters and--

                                  WILL

                No, no, don t do that.  It s just a 

                party where people get together and 

                say mean stuff about Kim.

                Kate, I have to tell you --

                                  KATE

                What the hell, Will?  (TO OTHERS) He 

                set me up with a tiny man on purpose!  

                                  WILL

                What?  He s a  nice  guy...    Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    27.

                Five-ten is my cut off and you know 

                that!  

                                  WILL

                That doesn t sound very Volvo-like.

                                  KATE

                Shut up.  This is a nightmare.  I had 

                to pretend I wasn t feeling well to 

                get out of going home with him and now 

                what am I supposed to say when he 

                calls?    

                                  WILL

                Nothing.  He s not going to call.  For 

                your information, he wasn t interested 

                in you, either.  

                                  KATE

                Of course he was interested.  He was 

                very interested.  

                                  WILL

                Not according to him.

                                  KATE

                  I don t... I don t understand.

                                  WILL

                He didn t like you.    Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    28.

                  I understand, I just don t understand!  

                He s, like, two feet tall!  How could 

                he not like me?!

      WILL SHRUGS.  HORRIFIED AND FURIOUS, KATE TAKES THIS IN.

                You know, I was surprised you called.  

                It didn t feel like we were totally 

                vibing the other night, but good on 

                you for reaching out.

                                  BOBBY

                Well, I mean... I was kind of 

                  responding to your invitation.  (OFF 

                LOWELL S CONFUSION) At dinner?  You 

                said,  we should hang out soon. 

                                  LOWELL

                If I m being honest, I was just being 

                polite.  I didn t think you d actually 

                call.  

                                  BOBBY

                Well, if I m being honest, I didn t 

                want to.  Andi thought it d be nice 

                for us to hang out and I forgot our 

                  anniversary and it just seemed easier 

                to come.      Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    30.


                                  LOWELL

                Huh.

                                  BOBBY

                What?  

                                  LOWELL

                I wonder why you forgot your 

                  anniversary.  Subconsciously, there 

                must be a reason, right?  How s your 

                  relationship?  Are you guys in a good 

                place?  Do you do nice things for each 

                other?

                                  BOBBY

                Of course not.  We re married.   

                                  LOWELL

                How often do you have sex?

                                  BOBBY

                What?  That s very... I don t... How 

                often do you?   

                                  LOWELL

                Not a lot.  Three, four times a week.  

      BOBBY REACTS.  THAT S A LOT.  

                                  LOWELL (CONT D)

                every day.  

                                  BOBBY

                What?!  Every day?  Like... every day?    Friends With Better Lives - "PILOT"    31.


                                  LOWELL

                Why?  How often does Andi?  

                                  BOBBY

                That s not really her thing.  Per se. 

                She used to.  A long time ago.  But 

                now, she just... no.  

                                  LOWELL

                Never?

                (DAWNING ON HIM) Now I do.  

      AND WE...

                                  BOBBY

                Because Andi wanted a surprise 

                  Anniversary party and she got me this 

                watch and the place that makes flowers 

                out of fruit closed down.

                                  BOBBY

                Because it s all the same people and 

                we can do it at my house and I ll pay 

                for half.  

                                  WILL
