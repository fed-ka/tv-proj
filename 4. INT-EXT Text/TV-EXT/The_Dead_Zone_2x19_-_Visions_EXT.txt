          It's one of those days that make you understand why people
          spend their summers in Maine.  The stadium seats are empty,
          but the field is buzzing with activity, as this is the
          finish line/reception area for a town-wide MARATHON. 

          CROWDS mill around booths selling juice, snacks, balloons,
          etc.  A van from a local RADIO STATION broadcasts live
          from the summer event.     

          Most people are cheering the runners as they come into
          the home stretch.  JOHNNY, SARAH, and J.J. are in the
          crowd.  J.J. is holding a paper water cup, craning his
          head to look down the line.

          Johnny is barely watching the race, mind elsewhere.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny.  Johnny.

          He snaps out of his funk, looks at her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, what?

                                        SARAH
                        You feeling okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Huh?  Yeah.  I'm having a great
                        time...

                                        SARAH
                        Staring at your shoes?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're really cool.

          Sarah shakes her head, then considers something else.

                                        SARAH
                        You weren't having a vision, were
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually, I was.  I saw myself,
                        at home, watching ESPN.

                                        SARAH
                        If you didn't want to come, you
                          should've said something.  You
                        used to love this marathon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's 'cause I was running in
                        it.
                                (beat)
                        And way before it was called the
                        "Faith Heritage Alliance Race for
                        Peace."

          (There may be a banner somewhere declaring just that.)

                                        SARAH
                        Who cares who sponsors it, it's
                        still a fun event for a good cause. 

          Johnny watches the runners come in.  Most wear white,
          some have peace slogans on their shirts or headbands.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (muttering to himself)
                        A cause with no effect.

          Johnny looks back to the marathon, and we drift into slow
            motion... sound becomes hollow as we watch people running,
          crossing the finish line, totally in the moment, unaware
          of the fate that he's seen for all of them.

                                        J.J. (O.S.)
                        Dad!

          Johnny turns to see WALT, running in shorts and a muscle
          shirt proclaiming "Penobscot County Sheriff Dept.," waving
          to cheering neighbors as he crosses the finish line.

          J.J. runs up to Walt with his cup of water, and Sarah
          follows him, clapping.  Johnny smiles as Walt scoops J.J.
          up into his arms.  Walt doesn't look that winded as he
          hams it up for J.J. 

                                        WALT
                        Did I win?  Did I win? 

          J.J. laughs, pouring the water cup over Walt's head. 
          Walt pulls Sarah into his embrace.  Johnny watches from a
            distance, a smile still on his face, however distant.  

                                        HOMELESS MAN (O.S.)
                        You have no meaning!  You mean
                          nothing!

          Johnny turns to see a HOMELESS MAN (he guesses) ranting
          and raving over by some recycling and trash bins.  The
          Man is wearing a dark, torn overcoat, boots, and a hood
          in the summer heat.  He is muttering loudly to spectators. 
          They are all pointedly ignoring him, but he continues.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        You're all dead.  Why bother? 
                        What?  What do you want me to
                        say, the end is coming?  The sky
                        is falling?

          Johnny stares harder, and then realizes... he recognizes
          this man.  Gripping his cane in hand, he begins to walk
          over.  As he nears, Johnny sees how ripped up the clothes
          are.  The look is Grim Reaper by way of Salvation Army. 

          The Man's left hand is jammed into his left pocket.

          His other hand gestures wildly.  The Man suddenly stops
          and POINTS DIRECTLY AT JOHNNY, spitting rage.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        Don't come any closer!  Shame on
                        you, Johnny Smith!  Shame on you
                        for what you've done to these
                        people!

          Johnny tenses.  This guy knows him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me?

          Johnny can see the Man's face; a face half scarred, maybe
          burned.  A face he's seen before.  A face that freezes
          him in his tracks.  The face twists into a pained smile. 

          The Man jams his free hand into its pocket and walks around
          the corner into the tunnels under the stadium.

          Johnny hurries after him in the same shot.  He rounds the
          corner only to find the tunnel empty.  Johnny can see way
          down the tunnel before it begins to turn. 

          There are no doors, nothing to hide behind.  Whoever the
          Man was, he just vanished into thin air.  Johnny, freaked
          out, turns to see if anyone else saw this.  No one did. 
          He is alone in the tunnel.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:


          From the right angle it looks like a haunted mansion.



                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        Hey, it's Bruce, I'm not home,
                        leave a message.

          Stock Shot flying over the hilly terrain surrounding the
          wealthy town of White Plains, NY.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Hey, it's me.  Listen, I'm heading
                        out of town, tonight.  Bruce, I
                        saw him again.



                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        He came to my house.  I think he
                        knows what I've seen, about
                          Armageddon.  He told me to drive
                        to New York... and I don't know
                        why, but I feel I've got to be
                        there.  Call you from the road...

          Johnny's jeep pulls up next to the street sign.  Nice,
          upper middle class homes line the street, and it looks
          like nothing bad could happen here.  Johnny gets out.


          TRACKING WITH JOHNNY'S CANE

          As it keeps pace with him.  He approaches...


          JOHNNY'S POV - A MAILBOX

          The old-fashioned kind with a red flag.  This one has a
          white cursive "1356" on it.  The name "WEY" is on the
          door.  The door opens as a LITTLE GIRL runs up and pulls
          it down, taking out a big handful of mail.  She smiles at
          Johnny and runs back to her HOUSE.     

          It's a blue House - white and light blue, that is.  Classy,
            inviting, not obnoxious. 

          A WOMAN (MADELEINE)is walking across the lawn toward the
          girl.  Mid-thirties, beautiful but not overdone. 

                                        MADELEINE
                        Let's see.
                                (the mail)

                                        LITTLE GIRL
                        I want to bring it in!

          The girl runs past her Mom, up to the porch steps.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT ONE - 06/23/03 - BLUE        11.


    16CONTINUED:16

          She slips on the second step, not seriously, and the mail
          flutters to the ground.  Madeleine shakes her head, and
          starts to pick it up.  She catches Johnny watching from
          the street, and gives him a polite smile. 

          Johnny returns the smile, but is disturbed by the scene:
          why was he told to come here?  Just then, he hears, then
          SEES a BLACK MERCEDES SPORTS CAR humming down the street
          toward him.

          He steps closer to the curb to let it pass.  It slows as
          it approaches, pulling into the driveway, DRIVER looking
          at Johnny through the side window.

          It is the HOMELESS MAN.  Except he has no burns on his
          face, and is wearing a clean, short sleeved polo shirt!

          Johnny tenses up as the car parks in front of the garage,
          and the Man gets out, looking back at Johnny. 

          The girl stops helping Mom pick up mail, and runs to...

                                        LITTLE GIRL
                        Daddy!

          She jumps into the Man's arms.  He kisses her, and moves
          on, glancing at Johnny as he carries her down the walk.
          He passes his Wife, as he heads up the steps, saying
            something to her as he heads in.  She follows up the steps,
          glancing back at Johnny before she closes the door.      

          Johnny hesitates, not sure what to do.  He tentatively
          takes a step toward the house, and soon finds himself at
          the front door.  Rings the doorbell. 

          A beat later, Madeleine answers the door.  Johnny misses
          the beat to introduce himself; this is just too strange.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Hi.  Can I help you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Um, yeah.  I was looking for your
                          husband.  I think.

          He winces at himself.  She looks suspicious.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Can I ask what this is regarding?

          The little girl, JULIA, precociously pokes her head between
          her Mom's legs, and looks up at Johnny.

                                        JULIA
                          Bonjour.

                        Va Bien, Merci.

          This gets a smile out of Madeleine, relaxing her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry, I've been on the road
                        for over ten hours, and I'm a
                        little out of it.  My name's Johnny
                        Smith, I just drove down here
                        from Maine.

                        Maine?

          The Man, who's name is CHRISTOPHER, shows up.

                        Maddy?

          He looks out the door, gives Johnny the once-over.  Johnny
          stares into his eyes.  It's definitely the same guy. 
          Without the burns he's actually handsome.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        What's going on?

          She looks back and forth between Johnny and Christopher.

                                        MADELEINE
                        You don't recognize him?

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        No.  Listen, we're not interested.

          He moves to close the door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait a minute, you have nothing
                        to say to me?

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Excuse me?

                        What's your name?

          Christopher bristles at Johnny's tone.

                          Julia...

          Johnny does not know what to make of this.  Chris does.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Like she said, you have the wrong
                          address.

          His forceful tone draws a curious glance from Madeleine.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's wrong, I'll give you
                        that.

          Christopher gives Maddy a "get inside" look.  She does so
          with reluctance, taking Julia with her.  Christopher stares
          Johnny down, speaking in a lower, more intimate tone.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Who're you with?  Frank's guys? 
                        The 309?  Alright, I get the
                          message.  Now, you listen to me. 
                        My daughter lives here, you
                          understand?  Maybe that's the
                        point; you can get to me.  Just
                        know that I can get to you.  I'm
                        not talking about your boss, I'm
                        talking about you.  Okay, "John
                        Smith?"

          He punctuates this with an aggressive PAT on the shoulder.

                        I said, are we okay?

          Johnny is frozen where he stands.  Christopher slams the
          door.  Johnny turns to look at the street, even more
          confused and disturbed than he was before he came here...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not even close...

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK:

                                              ACT TWO

          FADE IN:


          The site for a future shopping center.  The exoskeleton
          of what will be a supermarket has just started to appear,
          but basically this is still a big pit in the earth with a
          few construction trailers and machines around.  Parked
          nearby we see Christopher's BLACK MERCEDES sports car.

          Johnny is parked in his Jeep near the perimeter, watching
          Christopher Wey at work.  While he spies, he's on the
          cell phone with Bruce.

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        Listen, I'm glad to hear you're
                        alive, but I'm at work here...

                                        JOHNNY
                        C'mon, Bruce, this is serious.  I
                        need your help.



          Johnny leans forward in his car seat, staring at...

          JOHNNY'S POV   Christopher, hard-hat on, talking to a
            CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, going over blueprints.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's where it gets weird.  If
                        it's the same guy, then he's not
                        exactly a stalker.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Unless it's not the same guy, but
                        I'm pretty sure it is.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're actually making negative
                        sense.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Told you I need your help.  Can
                        you get off work?  Please?

          In his room, Bruce turns back to the young woman, who
          manages a smile, even though she's vaguely in pain.

                                        YOUNG WOMAN
                        Think that's as far as I can go
                        without a massage.

          Now it's Bruce's turn to feel pain.  He grips the phone.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll head out after lunch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks, Man.  Call me when you
                        get here.  I've gotta check
                          something out...

          Johnny hangs up and gets out of his Jeep.  He slips through
          the fence, into the site. 

          Johnny passes by Christopher's sports car.  As he touches
          it.  RAMP INTO JOHNNY'S FACE...



          Johnny enters and looks up.  Several beams and girders
          are already in place, with plywood ceilings that cut the
          sun off and make things a bit darker in here. 

          Johnny follows the sound of VOICES, proceeding as quietly
          as he can.

          He peeks around a beam and sees Christopher arguing with
          three men from the local construction union. 

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Frank, I'm not ignoring you, and
                        you know I would never disrespect
                        you, but I need you to trust me,
                        okay?  What I don't need, is for
                        you to send guys to my house. 
                        That won't solve anything.

                                        FRANK
                        What're you talking about?

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        You know who I'm talking about. 
                        "John Smith."

                                        FRANK
                        I don't know any John Smith.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                          Alright, whatever his real name
                        is.  Blonde guy with a cane.

          Suddenly Johnny FEELS something, like the hairs rising on
          the back of his neck.

          He turns to see a familiar SILHOUETTE watching him,
          standing at the end of a double row of steel beams.  The
          figure steps behind one of them. 

          Instead of heading directly there, Johnny moves a different
          way, toward an area where he hopes to cut the man off.

          Johnny gets there, and finds no one here.  Then...

                                        HOMELESS MAN (O.S.)
                        What are you doing here?

          Johnny looks UP, and sees the burnt man balanced on top

                        I could ask you the same question.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        You shouldn't be here. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You told me to come here. 
                          Remember?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've been there.  Nice house. 
                        Belongs to a guy named Christopher
                        Wey.  Heard of him?  You two sort
                        of look alike.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        He's not important.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But his wife and daughter... they
                        are important to you, aren't they?

          The Man glares down at Johnny, starts to pace up there.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        I... I need to see them...

                                        JOHNNY
                        "Before it's too late?"  It's
                        already too late.

                                (stops)

                        I'm not going to let you hurt
                        them.

          The Man starts to pace again, holding his head.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        Hurt them?  You... you saw that?

          It looks like he's going to fall.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've seen what you're going to
                        do.

          The Man stares down at Johnny, looking confused and
          vulnerable.

                        Why do you want to hurt them?

          Johnny turns to see the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN heading toward

          A heavy hand lands on his shoulder.

            Christopher, Frank, and the two union goons turn to see
          Johnny and the Foreman approaching.  Chris's eyes go wide.

                        Chris, I found this guy over by

                        My brother?  What's that got to

                        You know, it's dangerous to not
                        wear protective gear around a
                        site.  Could be an accident...

                        Frank, Frank, don't.

          Frank gets in Johnny's face... Johnny shakes off the
            distraction.  Christopher steps up next to Frank, trying
          to head off any violence.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        I'll make you a deal.  You stay
                        away from me, and stay away from
                        my family, and you can just leave.

                        Don't make deals.  Get him out of

          One of the other union guys moves toward Johnny, who backs
          away, shouting to Chris.

                        If you care about your family so
                        much, maybe you should stay away
                        from your secretary.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Those S-Class seats go back pretty
                        far, don't they?

          Chris runs up to Johnny, waving the union guy away.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Wait, wait, wait.  Excuse us for
                          a second. 


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT TWO - 06/25/03 - YELLOW      21.

          The union guy steps away, and Chris closes in on Johnny,
          who has now got his attention.  Chris talks low.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        What the hell do you want from
                        me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want to know about your brother. 
                        You're a twin, right?

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Twin?  No.  Ronnie was four years
                        younger than me.

          Now it's Johnny's turn to be confused.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Was?

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        He died when he was eight years
                        old.  From Lupus.

          Johnny, at a loss for words, just stares at Christopher.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Look, what do you want?  Money?

          Christopher is nervous now, thinking Johnny is trying to
            blackmail him.  Johnny looks away, toward the market site,
          where he just talked with the mysterious rag man.  Chris
          follows Johnny's look, curious.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.  You're right.
                                (looks back at Chris)
                        I've made a mistake...

          Christopher looks anxious as Johnny turns to walk away.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          REVERSE ON AN UGLY MAN

            Mid-forties, watching from his car.  He lowers the
            telephoto lens on his pro camera with a satisfied smile.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


  3232OMITTED



                                        BRUCE
                        How do you always manage to find
                        the most insane situation possible,
                        and then get me stuck in the middle
                        of it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        'Cause I need someone to believe
                        the most insane situation is
                          something that could really happen.

          Johnny rings the doorbell.  Waits.  No answer.  He turns
          to Bruce, who shrugs.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe no one's home.

          Johnny turns back to the door, and knocks.  On his THIRD
          KNOCK, WE SHOOT INTO THE DOOR, THROUGH THE PEEP-HOLE --

          To reveal MADELEINE on the other side, watching.

          Johnny realizes she's watching.  He looks directly into
          the peep-hole, nods to her, and turns to leave.

          He's down the porch steps when the door opens.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Wait.

          Johnny turns around.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I probably should've called first.

                                        MADELEINE
                        That's okay, I think I know why
                        you're here.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT TWO - 06/24/03 - PINK        25.



          Bruce bursts out onto the porch.  No one here.  He scans
          the backyard, which butts up next to a heavily wooded
          ravine area.  Johnny comes onto the porch beside him.

                                        BRUCE
                        The woods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Told you he's fast.

          Bruce jumps off the porch, powers across the backyard and
          into the woods.  Johnny turns back to a stunned Madeleine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stay inside, lock your doors!

          He runs off after Bruce.  Madeleine shuts the doors and
          locks them, as afraid of Johnny as anyone else, now. 



          Bruce tears through the trees, stops and listens.  Hears
          a faint rustling in the distance.  Runs off that way.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT TWO - 06/23/03 - BLUE        29.

          JOHNNY

          Enters the woods, moving slower than Bruce.

                                        HOMELESS MAN (O.S.)
                          Shouldn't have done that.

          Johnny stops in his tracks, turns to see the Man standing
          there.  Left hand in his pocket.  Right hand at his side.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        You scared her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        At least she's still alive.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        You're making a mistake.  All I
                        wanted to do was to see my family.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your family?

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        Yes.  And I can only look at them,
                        when you look at them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who the hell are you?

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        My name is Christopher Wey.  Or
                        at least, it used to be.  It
                        doesn't matter anymore. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't understand...

                                        WEY
                        What if I told you I wasn't really
                          standing here?  That you were
                        having a vision of me standing
                        here.  And that I am really
                          standing somewhere else, several
                        years into the future...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd say that you don't know how
                        my visions work.  I need to be
                          touching something. 

          Wey takes his hand out of his pocket.  Fingers open to
          reveal a small silver knob.  Johnny's heart catches as he
          recognizes it.  IT IS THE HEAD PIECE OF HIS CANE.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        So do I.

          Johnny brings up his cane, and stares in shock at the
            identical twin handle.  He DROPS HIS CANE and Wey suddenly
          VANISHES into thin air!  Johnny is alone in the woods. 

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:


          It is quiet now in the woods.  Johnny calls out...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce!

          No answer back.  After a beat, Johnny kneels down, and
          tentatively touches his cane.  Nothing happens.  He reaches
          up and carefully picks it up by the shaft.

          Nothing happens.  He grips the silver head... and we hear
          the crackle of a DZ SOUND EFFECT.  Our angle adjusts to
          show WEY, standing in the same exact spot as before.  He
          looks agitated.

                                        WEY
                        You see?  I knew the truth would
                        scare you.  That's why I couldn't
                          approach you directly.  I knew
                        you wouldn't understand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me try.  I'm seeing the future,
                        while you're seeing the past.
                        We're sharing a vision.

          Wey looks surprised.  Johnny rises to his full height.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Believe it or not, this has
                          happened to me before.  Once.
                                (re: cane top)
                        Where did you get that?

          Wey regards the iron sphere in his hand.

                                        WEY
                        It's a long story... though it's
                        missing a big piece.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

          Wey holds out his hands, one with the cane head in it.

                                        WEY
                        See for yourself.

          Johnny is wary, but Wey remains still.  Waiting.  Johnny
          steps forward.  He reaches out, slowly, and takes hold of
          the cane head in Wey's hand.  He can feel it.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/23/03 - BLUE      32.


    41CONTINUED:41

            Suddenly, Wey's other hand shoots out and grips the top
          of Johnny's cane, forming a CIRCUIT between them and
          shooting us into a MAJOR VISION SEQUENCE:



          WEY morphs into CHRISTOPHER (losing the burns, etc.) as
          he walks up his porch steps, unlocks his front door.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        The last thing I remember, was
                        walking into my house.  It was
                        August, I don't remember the day...

          He disarms the security code inside.  Flips the keys in
          his palm.  Takes a step inside...  A BLACK SHAPE moves
          behind him, and a blunt object SMASHES into the back of
          his head. 

                                                                      WHITE FLASH TO:



          Wey is upright now, stumbling against a bright, overexposed
          background.  Still in hospital gown, IV tubes and EEG
          wires dangle from his arms and head like exposed nerves. 

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        There was nothing to see...

          He trips on something, and falls down.  He pats the surface
          of what he tripped on.

          CORPSES caked with ash, choked to death.  Wey, completely
          dazed and out of it, feels their faces and clothes.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                          I thought I was in a nightmare...

          He liberates a pair of SUNGLASSES from the flannel shirt
          of one of the corpses.


  4747ANGLE   HAZY WHITENESS

          Wey, out of the field of focus, stumbles closer and closer
          toward us.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        I would come to know that I was,
                        in fact, in Baltimore, Maryland...

          He walks into CLOSE UP, squinting.  He puts on the dark
          sunglasses.  His mouth slacks open as his eyes adjust,
          seeing what we can see in their reflection...

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        Or, what was left of it.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 07/02/03 - GOLD      34.

          CAMERA SHOOTS INTO WEY S EYE



                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        There were other survivors, but...
                        no one I could trust.

          Wey, now dressed in his signature rag-tag outfit, hobbles
          away from a makeshift HOVEL, sucking water out of a fruit*
          can.*

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        I don't know how I made it, but
                          whatever happened... it changed

                        Every night, I had the same dream.

  6262CLIP FROM  THE STORM 

          Wey appears, looking at Johnny.  We quickly cycle through
          the OTHER INSTANCES in which the "Future Man" appeared to
          Johnny.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        At first, I didn't know you.  But
                        when I learned who you were, I
                        knew what I had become.



          Johnny pulls away from him, breaking the circuit, but
          still holding his cane.

                                        WEY
                        Now, every time that I hold this,
                        and you hold that...

          The potential of all this begins to dawn on Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We can see each other.

          WITH JOHNNY AND WEY

          Johnny hasn't noticed Bruce yet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen.  I need to know.  The
                        war.  Is it a war?  When exactly
                        does it...  How?  How does it
                        start?

                                        WEY
                        You don't know?
                                (beat)
                        Of course... not yet...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is it Greg Stillson?  I know he's
                        connected.

          Wey holds up a hand to silence him.

                                        WEY
                        You've got questions, and I've
                        got answers.  But first I need
                        you to tell me what happens to my
                        family.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        WEY
                        You said I hurt them.  I don't
                          remember that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How can you not remember...

                                        WEY
                        I told you, I'm missing a big
                        piece.  The last thing I remember
                        was walking into my house.  The
                        next thing was that I couldn't
                        see.  I risked talking to you
                        because I want to see my wife and
                        my daughter again.  And I need to
                        know what happened that night.

          Johnny is reluctant to tell Wey his gruesome vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you're like me, why haven't
                        you already seen it?  In a vision?

                        Where I'm from, there's nothing
                        left to touch.

          Wey holds up the cane head like the Greek Witches held
          out their one eye.

                                        WEY
                        This is all I've got.  You are
                        all I've got.  And I can only see
                        as far as you can.

                        When I touched you, the old you,
                          yesterday... I saw Madeleine and
                        Julia dead.  They were murdered. 

          Wey is hit hard by this.  Bruce has gotten closer, realizes
          Johnny is in a vision.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny?

                        I'll make you a deal.  You change
                        that... you save them... and I'll
                        tell you everything you want to
                        know. 

          Wey, overcome with despair, lets the cane head drop...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait, you have to tell me --

          Wey DISAPPEARS.  Johnny, upset, throws his cane down.  He
          now becomes aware of Bruce next to him.  Bruce picks up
          Johnny's cane, offers it back to him.

                                        BRUCE
                        No.  You better tell me.  After
                        we get out of here.  C'mon.           DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/25/03 - GREEN     39.



          Johnny and Bruce are halfway across the front lawn (coming
          from around the side of the house) toward the street,
          when Madeleine steps out onto her porch, calling out.

                                        MADELEINE
                          I called the police!  They're on
                        their way.

          She means it as a warning, as well.  Johnny turns back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good!  Stay inside till they get
                        here!

            Madeleine is not sure what to make of Johnny; is he
          dangerous, or is he really trying to help her?  Did he
          really see someone in back of her house?

                                        MADELEINE
                        What do you want?

          Johnny turns back again, and sees WEY, standing halfway
          across the lawn, in between him and Madeleine.  Although
          he's fifty feet away, it sounds like he's whispering in
          Johnny's ear.  

                                        WEY
                          Remember, Johnny.  Either you
                        save her, or I'll see us both in
                        hell. 

          Johnny looks from Wey to Madeleine.  She looks confused;
          what is Johnny staring at?  

          Wey turns around, and sees his wife.  He moves toward
          her, almost as if on reflex.  Walking across the lawn...

          Johnny lets his cane drop out of his hand, and Wey
          DISAPPEARS.  We can hear POLICE SIRENS in the DISTANCE.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry, I can't tell you right
                        now.  Just stay close to Julia. 
                        I'll be back, I promise.

                        Um, Johnny?  Time to go...

          Johnny picks up his cane by the wood, and heads out.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 07/02/03 - GOLD     39A.

          Johnny and Bruce approach the front door.  Johnny turns
          back to WEY, who is standing at the bottom of the porch
          steps, hands in his pockets.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where's the key?

                        Flower pot.

          Johnny kneels down, lifts the flower pot; there's the
          KEY.  Bruce looks back toward Wey.  Through him, actually,
          since he sees no one there.  It weirds him out.

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't know if this is such a
                        good idea.  Maybe we should wait
                        'till she gets home.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And say what?  Mind if we come
                        in, and try to figure out how you
                        get killed?

          He unlocks the door, opens it.  The security alarm panel
          starts to beep a warning.  Johnny looks to Wey, who is
          now suddenly beside him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you remember the code?

                        One, three... one... seven.

          Johnny punches it in.  The panel beeps acceptance.  Wey
          smiles to himself, sadly.

          ANGLE - FROM THE STREET

          We see a familiar car edge into frame. 

          LANCE FOSTER watches from behind his wheel as Johnny and
          Bruce enter the house.



            NEIGHBORS watch as Johnny and Bruce are ushered into the
          back of a police car, cuffed.  REVEAL Madeleine pulling
          into her driveway, Julia in the backseat.  LANCE FOSTER
          greets her as she gets out.

                                        MADELEINE
                        What's going on?

                          I called the cops as soon as I
                        saw them breaking in.

          She looks over to the cop car, sees JOHNNY turning to
          look at her through the back window.  He freaks out when
          he sees her standing next to Foster. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Madeleine!  That's him!  That's
                        him!  He's gonna kill you!

          Johnny's voice is muffled by the cop car.  He thrashes in
          the backseat as the car pulls away.  Madeleine shudders.

                                        FOSTER
                        You recognize him?

                        He's been by the house before.

                        He's also been to see your husband.
                                (off her look)
                        I was coming over to show you
                        these.

          He hands her an envelope, photos inside.

                                        FOSTER
                        He's in a few.  But the ones you
                        can use in court are...

          She's found them.  Photos of Christopher and his Secretary,
          making love in his Mercedes.  Foster watches as Maddy
          nods to herself, tears welling in her eyes.

          He reaches out slowly for her, almost touching her hair. 
          His touch snaps her back to the moment.  She shakes off
          being creeped out.

                                        MADELEINE
                        I, I'm sorry, it's just now people
                        are breaking into my house...

          Foster fidgets, nervously, his eyes never leaving her.

                                        FOSTER
                        If you don't want to stay here,
                        you're free to bring Julia, and... 
                        I have a spare room.

                                        MADELEINE
                        That's kind, thank you.  You're
                        right, I can't stay here.  I think
                        I'm gonna take Julia to my Mother's
                        house.  Tonight.

                                        FOSTER
                        Yeah, that's a good idea.  Tonight.

          Off Foster, we --

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:


          Christopher knocks on the door.  It's opened by a 65 year
          old woman, his MOTHER-IN-LAW.  He looks down, wordless,
            withering under her gaze for a beat.  She closes the door. 

          He waits outside.  We hear muffled VOICES from inside the
          house.  The voices escalate sharply.

          The door opens suddenly, Madeleine standing there.  They
          stare at each other for a long beat.

                                        MADELEINE
                        I said not to come here.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        You said not to call.
                                (beat)
                        I just came from the police
                          station.  They say we've got
                        nothing to worry about.

                                        MADELEINE
                        They're wrong.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        I know that everything that's
                        going on... is my fault.

                                        MADELEINE
                          Christopher.  I'm not going to
                        forgive you.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT FOUR - 07/02/03 - GOLD      51A.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        I know.  I don't want that.  I
                        just want to talk.

                                        JULIA (O.S.)
                        Daddy!

          Julia comes running down the hall, followed by her
            Grandmother, who fails to stop her as she runs past
            Madeleine and into Christopher's arms, where she buries
          her head and begins to cry. 

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Hey, hey what's wrong?

                                        JULIA
                        I was scared for you.

          He holds her close, mouthing softly to Madeleine:

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        I just want to talk.

                                        MOTHER-IN-LAW
                        He's not stepping foot inside
                        this house.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Mom, stay out of it.

                                        MOTHER-IN-LAW
                        This is my house.

          Maddy and Chris lock eyes, Julia between them.  She closes
          her eyes, and nods. 



            Christopher's car pulls into the driveway.  He gets out
          as Madeleine's car pulls off the street behind him. 
          Christopher looks at his house, thinking.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT FOUR - 06/23/03 - BLUE       54.

          He heads to Madeleine's window before she opens the door.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Let me check something out first.

          He walks up the walk.  Just like in the vision.  He ascends
          the porch steps.  Unlocks the front door.



          Julia gets out of her Mom's car, happy to be home. 
            Madeleine also gets out as Julia runs past, up the walk.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Honey, wait a minute.

            Suddenly, Madeleine reacts to a sound behind her.  She
          turns in SLOW MOTION as a BRIGHT LIGHT blinds her eyes.
