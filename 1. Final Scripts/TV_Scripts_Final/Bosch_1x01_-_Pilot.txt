EXT. U.S. DISTRICT COURT/DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

That peculiar mix of the magisterial and marginal that is 
downtown L.A.: lawyers, judges, law enforcement personnel and 
business executives, cheek by jowl with the homeless, the 
mentally ill, felons, ex-felons; para-legals and illegals.  

Christmas.  Holiday decorations on the lamp posts and nearby 
buildings.  In front of the federal building, a 20-foot 
tinseled Christmas tree that has seen better days.

On the steps of the plaza TWO CAMERAMEN are setting up their 
tripods, videocameras and a microphone tree.  No cameras 
allowed in federal court, so the stand ups will be outside.

Detective HARRY BOSCH -- early forties, tough, wounded -- 
stands by the statue of blindfolded Lady Justice, smoking.  
His eyes track an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE as she hustles up the 
steps and through the heavy glass doors.  He shoots his butt 
into the trash can and follows her in.


INT. COURTROOM 4/U.S. DISTRICT COURT - DAY

Bosch sits at one of the tables next to Assistant City 
Attorney RODNEY BELK.  The Blonde he followed into the 
 CHANDLER, courthouse sits at the other table: SUNNY  MONEY 
mid-thirties, killer eyes, killer legs, exceptionally good at 
what she does.  Next to her sits ROSA FLORES, middle-aged.

A FULL JURY seated in the box.  In the public gallery, 
several reporters, including NATE TYLER from the L.A. Times 
and TV reporter GLORIA NEWSOME, as well as a SKETCH ARTIST 
poised to capture the personalities of the case.

Judge ALVIN KEYES, sixties, Southern and courtly, enters from 
chambers and takes the bench.

BAILIFF
All rise.  The United States 
District Court for the Central 
District of California, Judge Alvin 
M. Keyes presiding, is now in 
session.  All persons having 
business before the court, draw 
near and you shall be heard.
Be seated.

Everyone settles, including the Judge.2.


KEYES
In the matter of Flores versus 
Bosch, are we ready for opening 
statements?

CHANDLER
Yes, Your Honor, the plaintiffs are 
ready to proceed.

Belk stands, all 250 pounds of him.

BELK
Your Honor, the defense is ready.

Bosch is a defendant here.

KEYES
Very well then.

KEYES turns his Atticus Finch attentions to the JURY.

KEYES (CONT D)
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for 
being on time this morning.  We 
will begin our trial today with 
opening statements from the 
attorneys for both sides.  These 
statements are not to be construed 
as anything like actual evidence.  
The attorneys, being attorneys, may 
make some highfalutin  allegations, 
but just because they say it, 
 make it true. doesn t

Polite smiles and chuckles from the JURY.

KEYES (CONT D)
It will be up to you to decide if 
what the lawyers allege in these 
statements is in fact proven during 
the course of this trial.  The 
plaintiffs always go first.  Ms. 
Chandler, you have the floor.

Chandler stands and moves to a lectern that stands off the 
corner of the jury box.  She smiles and begins, making eye 
contact with each of the jurors in turn. 3.


CHANDLER
The judge is quite right when he 
 tells you that the statement I m
about to make is only a blueprint, 
a road map, if you will, of the 
case I will be presenting on behalf 
of my clients, Rosa Flores and her 
daughter Elena.  I would like to 
take you down that road a piece -- 

She shoots a quick glance in Keyes  direction, to see if that 
bit of folksy landed.  Bosch glances at Belk and rolls his 
 homespun approach.eyes at Chandler s

CHANDLER (CONT D)
This is not a criminal case.  You 
may believe that what happened to 
 husband and father my clients was 
criminal, but in this courtroom we 
are trying a civil matter.  It 
involves the fatal shooting of a 
man named Roberto Flores.  A loving 
husband and father.

She glances at Rosa at the plaintiff s table and then behind 
her to the gallery and ELENA FLORES, fourteen, sitting 
tearfully in the front row.  

CHANDLER (CONT D)
Most of all, this case is about a 
 police officer, who wasn t
satisfied with his job and the vast 
powers that come with it.  He also 
wanted your job, ladies and 
gentlemen of the jury.  And Judge 
Keyes  job.  In fact, he wanted the 
 job, the job state of California s
of administering verdicts and 
sentences, especially carrying out 
executions.  He wanted it all.  
This case is about that officer, 
Detective Harry Bosch, sitting at 
 table. the defendant s

As she turns to look at him all eyes go to Bosch --

FLASHBACK TO:


EXT. ALLEY/PICO UNION - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Raining.  Dark.  As Chandler narrates, Bosch raises his gun 
and aims. 4.


ROBERTO FLORES kneels in a puddle, arms up and spread wide.  

CHANDLER (V.O.)
In acting under the color of law, 
Detective Bosch shot and killed 
Roberto Flores on the evening of 
November 12th, 2010. 

Bosch fires twice.  The bullets tear into his chest. 

CHANDLER (V.O. CONT D)
Shot twice through the heart.  We 
will prove that Roberto Flores was 
unarmed.  

Flores falls backward into the puddle, his empty hands 
splashing in the alley rainwater.

CHANDLER (V.O. CONT'D) (CONT D)
We will prove that he offered no 
resistance, he offered no threat.  
We will prove that Detective Bosch 
killed an innocent man...  

CLOSE ON 

Bosch, rain dripping off his face, looking at what he s done.

CUT BACK TO:


INT. COURTROOM 4/U.S. DISTRICT COURT - DAY

Chandler pauses and stares at the jury, selling it.  Bosch 
watches intently, already frustrated by her story.

CHANDLER
Ladies and gentlemen, we look up to 
our police.  We all depend on them, 
in matters of life and death.  Most 
of them -- the vast majority -- do 
a thankless job and do it well.  
What we are talking about here is a 
rogue cop, a killer cop, a cop who 
epitomizes the worst traditions of 
the Los Angeles Police Department,  
the bad old LAPD of Rampart and 
Rodney King.  A cop who one night 
four years ago took it upon himself 
to be judge, jury and executioner.  
Detective Bosch shot dead a man he 
thought was a killer.  But there 
was no legal basis for that belief.  
(MORE)5.

CHANDLER (CONT'D)
Mr. Flores had not been arrested or 
charged with any crime.  He had 
never been arrested or charged with 
any crime.  Roberto Flores had no 
criminal record.  He was unarmed 
that night.  There was no reason 
for Detective Bosch to consider him 
a suspect, to stalk him that night, 
to kill him in cold-blood.  The 
justice Detective Bosch decided 
Roberto Flores deserved that rainy 
night lasted only a few seconds.  
Just the time it took Detective 
Bosch to point his satin-finished 
nine millimeter Smith and Wesson 
and pull the trigger.  Twice.

Bosch follows the eyes of several jurors, leans forward past 
 Belk to see Rosa Flores crying quietly at the plaintiff s
table.  He sits back, barely masking his contempt.

CHANDLER (CONT D)
Ladies and gentlemen, the LAPD and 
the District Attorney took no 
action against Detective Bosch. 
They rubber-stamped his reckless 
and criminal behavior.  But thanks 
to you, Roberto Flores will have 
his day in court.  And you will be 
able to right the great wrong done 
to him and his family. 

 Bosch shakes his head.  Belk turns and gives a look:  don t
react.  He puts his hand on his arm -- Bosch brushes it off.

CHANDLER (CONT D)
The German philosopher, Friedrich 
 fights Nietzsche, said,  Whoever
monsters should take care that in 
doing so he does not become a 
monster himself.  For when you look 
into the abyss, the abyss looks 
into you. 
(then)
Ladies and gentlemen, that is what 
this case is about.  Detective 
Harry Bosch has looked into the 
abyss.  And on the night Roberto 
Flores was murdered, the abyss 
looked into him.

As all eyes go to Bosch,

FLASHBACK TO:6.


EXT. ALLEY/PICO UNION - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Bosch holds his dripping weapon, his unblinking stare.

CHANDLER (V.O.)
The darkness engulfed him, and he 
fell.  Detective Bosch became that 
which he was sworn to fight.  A 
monster...

Bosch walks over and looks down at Flores.  By his reaction, 
not what he expected.  Off Flores, eyes wide open, unseeing --

Chandler looks at each juror, in turn, and then says:

CHANDLER
Thank you.

As she takes her seat, Bosch exhales.  He tracks Chandler 
back to her table and catches the daughter, Elena, in the 
first row, staring daggers at him.  Unnerved, he turns away 
like a guilty man.

KEYES
We are going to take a brief recess 
before we hear from Mr. Belk.

BAILIFF
All rise...

As KEYES stands, everyone else follows --


EXT. U.S. DISTRICT COURT/DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

A HOMELESS MAN roots in the ash can for butts, mumbling to 
himself, as Bosch smokes by the statue, watching Gloria 
 opening.  Her Newsome tape a standup report on Chandler s
words drift across the plaza...  

NEWSOME
...the wrongful death civil suit of 
veteran homicide detective Harry 
Bosch opened today in federal court 
in downtown Los Angeles.  Bosch is 
being sued by the family of Roberto 
Flores, a man Bosch believed to be 
the serial killer known as the 
Dollmaker.  
(MORE)7.

NEWSOME (CONT'D)
The family contends Flores was not 
the Dollmaker, and that he was 
unarmed the night Bosch shot and 
killed him.  The Dollmaker case was 
never solved.  Although Bosch was 
cleared by the LAPD, questions 
remain about exactly what happened 
that night...

BOSCH
(under his breath)

He looks over as the Homeless Man abruptly stops mumbling, 
looks up at someone s approach and walks quickly away.  Bosch

BOSCH (CONT D)
You scared him off.

CHANDLER
He knows me.

He used to be a lawyer.  He s 
embarrassed for me to see him like 
he is now.

BOSCH
What happened to him?

CHANDLER
Long story.  Ask Bulk.  Maybe he ll 
tell you.

BOSCH

Speaking of which.  Can I ask you 
something -- just you and me here?  
Why didn t the city settle this 
 all gone away case?  It could ve

do it every week.

BOSCH

I d go out and get my own lawyer if 
they tried to settle.  

He looks over to Newsome, who is interviewing a CITIZEN.

media.

watching the widow and the daughter 
crying their eyes out every day?

BELK (V.O.)
...The law gives a police officer 
the right to use deadly force if he 
believes he is in danger.


INT. COURTROOM 4/U.S. DISTRICT COURT - DAY

Off the Courtroom Artist s SKETCH of Belk at the lectern PAN 
up to Belk, half way through his opening statement.  Bosch 
sits at the defense table, staring straight ahead, unable to 
look at his lawyer, who he and everyone else knows is second 
tier talent compared to Chandler.

BELK
Which is what Detective Bosch 
believed.  That his life was in 
danger.  A dark rainy night, an ill-
lit street, crime-ridden 
neighborhood, a dedicated detective 
in hot pursuit of a serial killer.

CHANDLER
(on her feet)
Objection.  An unproven 
characterization, your honor.

KEYES
Which is exactly what this trial is 
for, Ms. Chandler.  
(MORE)10.

KEYES (CONT'D)
I did not allow Mr. Belk to 
interrupt your opening, which, I 
might add, was replete with 
unproven characterizations of 
Detective Bosch.

CHANDLER
Yes, your honor.  I apologize.

She sits.  Belk continues, a little thrown by the 
interruption.

BELK
A police officer in threatening, 
possibly dangerous circumstances, 
trying to apprehend a suspect, is 
allowed, under the law, to use 
deadly force when he believes his 
own life is in jeopardy.  The facts 
of this case will show that Mr. 
 Flores ignored Detective Bosch s
repeated commands to stop moving 
and put up his hands.  He ignored 
repeated commands to keep his hands 
in plain sight --

 chest.alley, his gun is pointed directly at Flores 

BELK (V.O.)
Ms. Chandler quoted Nietzsche.  Let 
me quote Sun Tzu, The Art of War. 
When Detective Bosch encountered 
Roberto Flores on that dark, rainy 
street three years ago, he entered 
what Sun Tzu called The Dying 
Ground.

Flores  right hand goes inside his rain coat.

Bosch yells at him to stop and put up his hands.  Flores 
draws a gun and brings it up in a two-handed grip.

BELK (V.O.)
At that point Detective Bosch had 
to fight or perish, shoot or be 
shot.  To second guess his actions 
now is impossible -- and unfair.  
 there.  We weren t11.


Bosch fires two shots to the chest before Flores can get off 
a shot.

Flores goes down in a puddle.  Bosch lowers his gun and 
stares at what he has done.  Rain drips off his face.

INT. COURTROOM 4/U.S. DISTRICT COURT - DAY

Back to Belk.

BELK
Detective Bosch reacted as he 
should have, just as all his 
training and experience taught him 
to -- with deadly force.  Mr. 
Flores had only himself to blame. 
His death was a result of choices 
he made that night. Detective Bosch 
acted properly, under the color of 
law...
(pause)
Thank you.

Belk shuffles over and sits.  Bosch glances at the jury.  
They seem unmoved, blase.  Keyes shuffles papers.

KEYES

 enough for today.  We are that s
going to take the weekend, to 
separate opening statements from

The courtroom starts to stir, relieved.

KEYES (CONT D)
 Please remember the court s
admonishment to avoid reading or 
listening or watching any media 
reports on this trial.  I wish you 
all a good weekend.  Thank you all 
very much. 

BAILIFF
All rise.12.


The judge leaves the bench and the jury shuffles through the 
rear door to the assembly room.  Tyler, Newsome and the other 
media types exit, Chandler and the Flores family in tow.  
Belk leans back.

BELK
What do you think?

Bosch pushes his chair back and gets up.

BOSCH
I think she ate your lunch.

He leaves Belk in a pool of his own flop sweat.

Bosch, behind the wheel, smoking, listening to jazz radio -- 
 something with momentum.  Freddie Hubbard sHub Cap. 

Hollywood Boulevard is decked out in candy canes and tinsel 
on the light posts and glittery Christmas scenes strung above 
every intersection.  Xmas in Tinsel Town.

Bosch goes past A COUPLE OF CUSTODIES cuffed to a bench -- 
one of them a drunken Santa Claus, his red hat askew.  He 
looks up at Bosch with blood-shot eyes.

BOSCH

He steps through back door of the detective bureau.


INT.  BULLPEN/DETECTIVE BUREAU/HOLLYWOOD STATION - CONTINUOUS

Late afternoon, holiday Friday, half empty.  Holiday decs on 
the walls and a few desk-top Christmas trees.  But it all 
looks old and dusty and straight out of a box that is pulled 
from storage every December 1st.  The usual squad room 
clutter: file cabinets, counters, desks, every flat surface 
awash in files and paperwork.  A FEMALE DETECTIVE at a desk 
in a pod under a sign that says CRIMES AGAINST PERSONS is 
wearing a Santa Claus hat.

Bosch goes to a December deployment board nd runs his finger 
along the date boxes until he gets to the weekend.  He stops 
his finger under the names JOHNSON and MOORE.  13.


He turns and sees JOHNSON and MOORE, both overweight and 
middle-aged, putting on their suit jackets, on their way out.  
Bosch walks over, taking an envelope out of his coat pocket.

BOSCH
Crate and Barrel, just the two guys 
I want to see.

Bosch starts looking through a stack of phone messages, 
pointedly ignoring his partner, JERRY EDGAR a/k/a J.

CAMERA moves through his neat, austere house.  The dining 
room table is a work table, stacked with files.  The living 
 room is basic: no personal photos, just a print of Hopper s
Nighthawks over the functional couch.  A rarely used pre-flat 
screen tube TV.  No Christmas decorations, no indoor plants.  
A perfect place for a man whose whole life is his work, and 
whose work is a sacred mission.  The only touch of 
extravagance is the stereo -- no expense spared here.  Frank

Bosch and Edgar move down the alley, carrying their weapons 
ready.  Dumpsters, abandoned cars, debris, graffiti on every 
wall.

They come to a crossing street.  They pause and look at each 
other.  Bosch signals to Edgar, motioning him to go down the 
street while he stays in the alley.   They separate.

Bosch continues down the alley alone.  Ten steps and suddenly 
Flores stands up from behind a dumpster.  He raises his hands 
and steps into the middle of the alley.  

Bosch yells at him to get on his knees and raise his hands.  
Flores complies, drops to his knees in a puddle. (To this 
point, this matches what Chandler described in her opening 
statement.) 

Bosch raises his gun --

hand, lifts it to his nose, inhales, gently puts it down. 
Does the same with the left hand.  Looks under her feet, 
feels under the driver's seat, shifts position, leans over 
her body, feels down in the space between seats.  Under the 
passenger seat, he finds something: a small caliber handgun. 20.


He sniffs the barrel, stands, turns, hands gun to SID Tech.  
Strips off his gloves.  Catches Uniform's eye.

BOSCH (CONT D)
Suicide.  

UNIFORM
Whoa.

BOSCH
Swab her left hand to confirm 
gunshot residue.  Send me the 
report.

Bosch turns back, contemplates Dead Woman, then looks out at 
the City of Angels.  Incomparable view, incomparable day.

BOSCH (CONT D)

like this?

On Bosch, gazing at the last thing she ever saw, wondering 
why here, what was she thinking when she pulled the trigger --


EXT. WONDERLAND AVENUE - DAY

DR. GUYOT, elderly, walking his yellow lab, CALAMITY, on this 
glorious day, up the hill.  Gorgeous.  Flowers in December. 
Stops at the end of the street, leans down --

DR. GUYOT
You gonna be good?

He lets her off the leash.  She's off like a shot, up the 
hill, and into the woods.  As Dr. G trudges after her --


EXT. LAKE HOLLYWOOD OVERLOOK/MULHOLLAND DRIVE - DAY

Bosch stands next to his car filling out reports, using the 
hood as a desk.  The Uniform saunters over.

UNIFORM
Suicide, huh?

BOSCH
Yep.

UNIFORM
Beautiful girl like that... I mean, 
why?21.


Without looking up Bosch points at the Hollywood sign which 
is very close on the next mountain ridge.

BOSCH

Bosch goes back to writing while the Uniform looks up at the 
sign and contemplates what Bosch just said.


EXT. WONDERLAND AVENUE - DAY

DR. GUYOT, at the edge of the woods, leash in hand, whistling 
for his dog.  He whistles.  He calls.

DR. GUYOT
Calamity?  Here, girl.  Come on, 
girl. Come, dammit.  Calamity? 
Calamity Jane?

A rustle in the brush, and Calamity emerges from the woods.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
Good girl.  Come.

She trots toward him, a dark piece of driftwood in her mouth.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
Come.  Bring it here. 

He reaches down to take it from her.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
Give it to me.  Leave it.  Leave 
it.  Calamity --

She growls and bares her teeth.  Dr. Guyot frowns, leans in, 
takes a closer look.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
What do you have there, girl?

Calamity growls again, guarding her prize -- 


 SEDAN - LAKE HOLLYWOOD OVERLOOK - DAYINT. BOSCH S

Late afternoon.  Getting dark.  BOSCH, behind wheel, checks 
car clock: 4:20.  He watches through the windshield as the 
BODY CREW removes the dead woman from her car and puts her on 
a stretcher, then covers her with a green blanket.  As they 
open the back of the van and start loading her in, his cell 
phone rings and he answers.22.

Bosch turns onto Wonderland Avenue --24.

Bosch, driving up the steep, winding street, to dead-end 
traffic circle, pulls up behind a patrol car, cuts engine.


EXT. DR. GUYOT S HOUSE/WONDERLAND AVENUE - DAY

Bosch looks up at steep wooded hillside.  Gauges the light, 
looks at watch, mutters to himself, heads for --


 HOUSE - DAYEXT. FRONT DOOR/DR. GUYOT S

The door is opened by a strikingly attractive officer in her 
mid-thirties, JULIA BRASHER.  She makes the uniform look 
good.  Bosch shows his badge, steps in --


 HOUSE - DAYINT. HOME OFFICE/DR. GUYOT S

Bosch enters, Brasher behind.  Guyot, at his desk, Calamity 
curled at his feet, a large book -- Gray s Anatomy -- open in 
front of him, an open shoebox next to that, with an Officer, 
JULIUS EDGEWOOD, black, mid-thirties.  Guyot, wearing latex 
gloves, is comparing something in the book to what's in the 
shoebox.  Bosch nods at EDGEWOOD.

EDGEWOOD
Detective Bosch.  Dr. Guyot.  He 
found the bone.

DR. GUYOT
To be accurate, my dog found it.  I 
just called it in.

Bosch steps over to the desk, leans in to look at the dark 
yellow-brown object in the box.

BOSCH
This it?

DR. GUYOT
I was just showing the officer.

Guyot spins the book around: taps an illustration of a bone, 
posterior and anterior views -- and a small sketch of a 
skeleton with the humerus bone of both arms highlighted.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
 Those highlighted areas -- that s
the humerus.  If we compare it to 
the recovered specimen --25.


Guyot lifts the bone out and compares it to the illustration:

DR. GUYOT
  Way up the hill I didn t.

BRASHER
Calamity.

Bosch gives her a look, she steps back.  To Edgewood: 

BOSCH
You guys can clear.  I can take it 
from here.

Edgewood gets the message, glances at Brasher, nods yes.26.


BOSCH (CONT D)
 And keep this off the air.  Don t
want the media hyenas sniffing this 
out.

EDGEWOOD
Copy that.

They exit.  Bosch turns back to Guyot, pulls on a glove.

BOSCH
You told the sergeant that the bone 
had a fracture --

Guyot runs a finger along a vertical striation.

DR. GUYOT
 a break See the striation?  That s
line, Detective.  A healed 
fracture.

BOSCH
Healed?

Broken and mended.  Ante-mortem.

 He holds the bone out to Bosch and he takes it.  While he s
studying the break line --

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)

usually comes from severe twisting 
of the limb.

Their eyes meet.  The moment s broken as Dr. Guyot comes out 
with Calamity on a leash and Brasher turns at the sound.  
Bosch glances down into the trunk, sees his flashlight, 
checks if Brasher's watching, covers it with an oil rag.  He 
grabs a roll of crime scene tape and a digital camera, slams 
the trunk closed, turns to her. 

BOSCH (CONT D)

She smiles, slides hers off her belt and gives it to him.

BOSCH

BRASHER
Sure.28.


DR. GUYOT
Ready.

BRASHER

Bosch nods, pleased. She signals Edgewood in the car, points 
up hill. But Edgewood pulls the car up, lowering his window.

EDGEWOOD
Just got a hot shot, partner. 
Double D.

BRASHER
I hate domestic disputes.

BOSCH
(dryly)
Me, too.  Especially when they turn 
into homicides.

BRASHER

He starts to hand her back her flashlight, she demurs --

BRASHER (CONT D)

luck.

You too.  Be careful.

She jumps in the car and it takes off.  Bosch steps over to 
the doctor and his dog.

DR. GUYOT

(unhooking the leash)
Go get the bone, girl. Go get it!

Calamity's gone like a shot. Guyot smirks an I told you so 
look as Bosch turns on the flashlight and starts uphill --29.


EXT. WOODS/LAUREL CANYON - DAY

The sun isn't down yet but the woods are dark.  Bosch climbs 
slowly, grabbing branches to pull himself up.  He can hear 
Calamity crashing through the brush way up ahead, Guyot 
CALLING and WHISTLING somewhere down below.  


EXT. WOODS/LAUREL CANYON - DAY

Bosch comes to a level area where the trees are thinner.  He 
sees the dog by a stand of acacia trees, but it takes off. 
Bosch walks over and starts scanning the ground with the 
light.  Finds a place where the earth has been dug up, 
disturbed.  With his foot he stirs the loose dirt, uncovering 
a batch of small brown twigs.  Then he realizes they aren't 
twigs at all.

He kneels, shines light.  Dawns on him what he's looking at: 
SMALL DELICATE BONES, scattered in the newly disturbed dirt.  

He stands, begins taking pictures, close on the bones first.  
He steps back and takes a wider shot of the area.  He puts 
down the camera and starts marking off the area with the 
crime scene tape -- 


EXT. CRIME SCENE/WOODS/LAUREL CANYON - DAY

Bosch has finished taping off the area.  Almost dark.  BOSCH 
starts back downhill, cutting pieces of tape with a penknife 
and tying them to branches to mark his path --


EXT. WOODS/WONDERLAND AVENUE/LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

Bosch makes his way downhill.  He loses his footing, FALLS 
heavily, sliding into a tree trunk, ribs first.  

He lies still for a moment, then groans, feels his side.  
Hurts to breathe.  As he struggles painfully to his feet --


EXT. DEAD END/WONDERLAND AVENUE/LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

Guyot, with a neighbor, VICTOR ULRICH, as he puts the leash 
on a panting Calamity --

ULRICH

DR. GUYOT

ULRICH

Bosch emerges from the woods, shirt torn and bloody, face 
scratched. He is favoring his ribs on one side.

DR. GUYOT

BOSCH
I fell. 

DR. GUYOT
I should take a look at that.

Bosch weighs what to say, then:

The door is opened.  TERESA CORAZON, 40, attractive, Latina.

CORAZON

Bosch looks back at his city car.

BOSCH
Nah, I traded that junker in for a 
newer one.

As he steps in --

BOSCH waits, "admiring" the tastefully flocked all-white  
Christmas tree hung solely with blue lights and ornaments.  
He holds the shoebox under one arm.  He shifts it to his 
other arm and it aggravates his ribs.  He winces at the pain, 
just as Corazon enters, carrying his camera.33.


CORAZON

Bosch, in uniform, full gear, alone, making his way 
cautiously down a pitch black tunnel, infra-red goggles, 
sweeping it with his high-tech light. Distantly, the SOUND of 
a CHOPPER from the world above.

Sees a faint cold purple white GLOW at a bend in the tunnel.  
Switches off his own light.  Holds up his hand. He can see it 
in front of him. Puts his hand down, moves slowly toward the

behind several official vehicles parked at the cul de sac. 

Brasher gets out of the Prius.  She s in off-duty clothes but 
has her badge hanging around her neck.  She holds it up to a 
uniform officer posted at the bottom of the hill.  He lets 
her pass and she starts climbing the hill.  A series of ropes 
have been strung tree to tree and portable stairways put in 
place here and there to make climbing the hillside easier.

TOP OF THE HILL40.


Bosch stands with Edgar, holding a crudely drawn chart of the 
hilltop that is dissected into squares, directing a small 
group of YOUNG POLICE CADETS on how he wants them to conduct 
a surface search of the area.

BOSCH
We spread an arms distance apart in 
one line and we move slowly across 
each quadrant on the map...  
Slowly, got it.  Take your time...

In background Teresa Corazon and her excavation team:  DR. 
WILLIAM GOLLIHER and KATHI KOHL, plus ASSISTANTS, are 
conducting an excavation of the site Bosch discovered the 
night before.  There is a VIDEOGRAPHER recording their 
efforts, always sure to keep Corazon in the frame.

Bosch sees Brasher make it to the top of the climb.  He hands 
Edgar the chart.

You get them going.  Good luck.

Bosch walks over to Brasher, curious but pleased to see her.

BRASHER
I heard you needed volunteers.  I 
offer my services.

BOSCH
Thanks, we could use you.

somebody would bury a body up here.

 dig is covered by a makeshift canopy.  The The coroner s
perimeter of the grave has been dug out and Golliher -- 50s, 
ponytail, Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts -- is using small 
digging instruments and brushes to slowly reveal the bones. 
It looks like an anthropological dig. 41.


Corazon is not getting dirty herself, preferring to stand 
 wearing a ton of makeup outside the tape and direct.  She s
for the camera.

Golliher lifts a sizable bone from the dirt, brushes it off 
and hands it up to Kohl.

GOLLIHER
Left femur -- mark it in B-twelve. 

Kohl takes the bone to a folding table where all the bones 
are being placed after retrieval.  She then charts the find 
on a sheet on a clipboard that holds a sketch of the burial 
sight.  Bosch and Brasher step over and look at the table. 
Bones from the ribs, spine, arms, hands, hips and now the 
femur (thigh bone) arranged on the table.  Kohl puts down the 
chart and Brasher takes a look at it, reading the top line:

BRASHER

The coroner has stepped over, her Videographer in tow.

CORAZON (CONT D)

blocks of a city.  We know exactly

GOLLIHER (O.S.)
Detective Bosch.

Bosch looks over.  Golliher is at the dig site, holding 
something up with a tool. 

Bosch steps over, pulling a plastic evidence bag from his 
back pocket.  Golliher drops a quarter into it.

GOLLIHER (CONT D)
Nineteen ninety.  Found it by the 
left wing of the pelvis -- it was 
 probably in our young victim s
pocket.  That puts us inside twenty-
five years.

GOLLIHER
Two other things I want to 
emphasize preliminarily.  Grave 
depth and location terrain.  They 
tell us something about what 
happened here.

BOSCH
Tell us what?

GOLLIHER
A contradiction.  We are talking 
about a very shallow grave which 
suggests panic, poor planning. But 
by the same token, the remote 
location, the difficult terrain...

BOSCH
Tells us the opposite.  Like the 
place was chosen.  Ahead of time.

Golliher nods, then turns back to his work.43.


BRASHER
Detective, how do you want me to 
help?

Bosch points off at Edgar.

BOSCH

into the grave and scattered the 
bones over time.

BRASHER

She nods and smiles.  Bosch watches her go off toward Edgar.


EXT. HILLSIDE CRIME SCENE - LATER

A second folding table now and the dig team has added scraps 
of deteriorated clothing, the elastic band from a boy s pair 
of underwear and a backpack that appears largely intact.

Bosch is looking at the assembly with Golliher, who is taking 
a break, eating yogurt out of a plastic container.

GOLLIHER
Haines underwear.  That and the 
pelvis assembly confirm we have a 
male here.

Bosch studies what remains of a life on the tables.

There is a sharp WHISTLE.  Bosch looks across the hilltop and 
sees Edgar and Brasher standing together in the knee-high 
brush.  Edgar is signalling them over with both hands.

EXT. HILLSIDE CRIME SCENE/TALL BRUSH - MOMENTS LATER

Bosch and Golliher walk up and Edgar steps back.

EDGAR
Brasher found it.

BOSCH looks down.  A CHILD'S SKULL, half-buried in the soil, 
hollow eyes looking up at him.44.


He looks up, finds BRASHER.  She looks back at him, sobered.  

Golliher kneels down next to the skull.  He bends down to 
study it from all angles.  He then puts his hand on the top 
of it, his finger tracing a triangle pattern in the bone.

Corazon, her videographer and a STILL PHOTOGRAPHER join the

GOLLIHER
The cranium shows clear evidence of 
fracture lines and surgical 
healing, which again indicates 
we re dealing with relatively 
contemporary bones.  Can we get 
this photographed so I can collect 
it?

The videographer and still photographer move in as Golliher 
stands and steps back.  He turns to Bosch and confides:

GOLLIHER (CONT D)
There was a surgery ante mortem. So 
there will be records -- somewhere. 
Hospital records. You may be able 
to get your identification that 
way.

Bosch nods.  Golliher returns to the skull.  Kneeling down he 
carefully extracts it from the soil.  From his back pocket he 
pulls a paint brush and uses it to carefully brush the dirt 
off the skull. 

GOLLIHER (CONT D)

He turns the skull and pauses when his brushwork reveals a 
fracture at the rear base of the skull.

Bosch squats down next to him to look.

Blunt force trauma?

GOLLIHER

BOSCH

Bosch looks up at the somber faces of those gathered around 
them in a circle.  The videographer has his camera on him but 
 a man on a mission.Bosch no longer cares.  He s

Tables and canopy are gone.  Bones have been collected and 
 Office.   Corazon and packed for transport to the Coroner s
her videographer are gone.  Golliher and Kohl and their 
Assistants are carefully going down the makeshift stairs 
carrying bone boxes in two hands.  

Bosch, Edgar and Brasher remain behind.  To Edgar:

BOSCH
City services will leave the ropes 
and the stairs in place for the 
next two days, in case the DA wants 
us to come back for more photos or 
to survey the hillside.  You check 
with a deputy in major crimes

They separate.  Bosch goes into the woods.  Slips behind a 
thick tree to relieve himself.  But then he peeks around the 
other side to get a line on the man hiding in the trees.

Bosch gets a bead on him and starts moving quickly through 
the brush, but his footfalls announce his movement.

The MAN alerts, then starts moving away.

The chase is on. Bosch runs through the heavy brush. 

A branch hits him in the side and he groans as it rakes 
across his wounded ribs.   He keeps going and is gaining on 
the Runner.

Edgar comes out of nowhere and tackles the fleeing figure. 

Bosch catches up, holding his side.  Edgar and the Runner are 
rolling around in the brush.

THE RUNNER
Wait, wait.  Hold it. 

Edgar straddles him and pins him face down.  Wincing, Bosch 
leans in for a closer look. 

BOSCH

stands, brushing himself off.

A red jacketed waiter comes down the bar.

WAITER

Bosch and Brasher turn to look at each other at the same 
time.  The moment of decision.


 HOUSE - NIGHTINT. BEDROOM/BOSCH S

Bosch and Brasher make love urgently, their moves matched by 
the jazz from the living room stereo -- the Sonny Rollins and 
Branford Marsalis duet of For All We Know.  Like the two 
saxophones, they move in competing but complementary rhythms.

Bosch s ribs hurt. He makes wincing sounds and she pauses -- 

BRASHER

BOSCH
In a good way.

BRASHER

In response he kisses her fiercely.  As they resume --54.


 HOUSE - NIGHTINT. BEDROOM/BOSCH S

They lay side by side in the dark.  Bosch reaches up to the 
lamp on the side table and turns it on. The action stresses 
his ribs, and she sees the purple blossoms on his side.  The 
 music changes -- Frank Morgan sYou Must Believe in Spring.

off the floor and goes into the bathroom.

BRASHER (O.C.)
What are the bullet casings for?

BOSCH
Oh... nothing really.55.


The toilet flushes and Brasher comes out, now seductively 
wearing Bosch s shirt.  She gets in bed and climbs on top of 
Bosch.  She leans over and turns out the lamp.

s  much later.  Brasher is asleep, her hand on Bosch It s

INT. FOSTER HOME - DAY - FLASHBACK

BLACK AND WHITE, jumpy IMAGES distorted by a FISH-EYE LENS:  
TWELVE-YEAR-OLD HARRY running down a hallway, pursued by an 
ANGRY ADULT MALE with a baseball bat.  

Trapped at the end of the hallway by a blank wall, TWELVE-
YEAR-OLD HARRY turns to face his pursuer.  The ANGRY ADULT 
MALE raises the bat to strike, and TWELVE-YEAR-OLD HARRY 
raises his forearm to fend off the blow --


 HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHTINT. BOSCH S

Bosch comes out of the memory -- too painful to stay there. 
Brasher is still sound asleep. 

He slowly gets up and gently puts her hand down on a pillow. 
He starts to get dressed in the dark.


EXT. WONDERLAND AVENUE CUL DE SAC/LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

Bosch s car is parked under the lone street light. We see the 
beam of a flashlight making its way up the wooded hillside.

EXT. HILLTOP CRIME SCENE/LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT

Bosch turns off the flashlight.  The moonlight is bright 
enough.  He is squatting at the spot where they found the 
skull of the murder victim.  Bosch picks up a handful of 
dirt, lets it run through his fingers.  Another handful.  He 
sifts through the dirt, getting a feel for what happened here 
so long ago, communing with the soul of the dead boy, whoever 
he may be.  He mutters to himself.  Making him a promise.

The nearby brush rustles.  Bosch flicks on the flashlight:

A COYOTE56.


It looks at Bosch, curious.  Bosch watches it.  Maybe the 
coyote disturbed the grave and brought him the case.  The 
coyote turns and disappears into the brush.

Bosch turns off the light.

Off Bosch at the burial ground, alone in the night -- 


EXT. U.S. DISTRICT COURT/DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

Bosch is once again at the statue having a smoke before court 
begins.  He watches a steady parade of MEDIA and TRIAL 
JUNKIES entering the courthouse.

He sees Tyler go in.

Then he sees Rosa and Elena Flores being escorted by Money 
Chandler.  Elena is the only one to glance Bosch s way.  She 
quickly looks away.

The Homeless Man from the other day shuffles up, muttering to 
himself, sounding like he says something about the  Concrete 
 just before he kisses two fingers, then reaches up Blonde 
and touches them to the butt of the statue of Lady Justice. 
He then goes to the ash can, finding the pickings thin.

HOMELESS MAN
I hate Mondays.

Bosch walks over and throws his butt into the can, then hands 
the homeless man his half full pack of cigarettes.

BOSCH
You and me both, brother.


INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

As Bosch approaches Courtroom 4 he sees Lt. Pounds on a bench 
sitting next to CHASTAIN, an IAD investigator who will be a 
witness in a latter episode.  Bosch despises both.

at Bosch.  The jury stares at Bosch.  Out in the gallery all 
eyes are on Bosch.  He moves his stare from Chandler and 
looks out and clocks Rosa Flores, Tyler, Irving.  He sees a 
new face staring at him:  FBI AGENT LILLY, late thirties, who 
examines Bosch with intense interest.  Bosch doesn t know who 
the mystery man is but he recognizes him as law enforcement.
