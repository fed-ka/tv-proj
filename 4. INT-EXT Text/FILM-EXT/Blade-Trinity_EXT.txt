Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of
rocky desert.
Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an
ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud
brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur.
SUPER TITLE:	SOUTHEASTERN IRAQ, DHI QAR PROVINCE
SIX MONTHS AGO
AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER
kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep.
He
is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a
religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO.
Presently, we hear HELICOPTERS.
The sheepherder looks up --
TWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS
approach from the East.
They touch down near the base of the
ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust.
FOUR FIGURES
disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear.
They
wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the
teeth.
To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens.
One of the figures turns to the East.
We can see the rising
sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of
a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He
raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day.
Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward.
They mount the central steps of the ziggurat.
-- a MASSIVE EXPLOSION ripping through an industrial building.
Banks of windows BLOW OUTWARDS, FIRE ROlLS, brick walls
CRUMBLE, raining debris everywhere.
A SCREAMING, BURNING MAN
goes tumbling into the night air.
Buoyed by the explosion,
his body flies upward, trailing fire like a human comet.
MORE MEN (VAMPIRES) race out, some of them on fire.
CLOSER
as a FORMIDABLE FIGURE resolves out of the swirling flames.
It's Blade, striding towards us in slow-motion, body bristling
with weapons, the exaggerated sounds of his FOOTFALLS ringing
out like drums of doom.
He looks like the God of War.
WHOOSH!
We ramp back up to
real-time.
Then faster as --
-- a TRIO OF VAMPIRE LOW-LIFES (STONE, GEDGE, and CAMPBELL)
run for their lives towards their vehicles.
TWO MODIFIED
STREET RACING CARS are pulling out; a Mustang and an Eagle
Talon.
Gedge is climbing into the Talon even as it starts to
move, pulling the door shut.
At the same time --
-- Stone and Campbell climb atop two stretched and lowered
hardtail chopper cycles.
Blade starts forward, drawing two of
his custom MACH pistols, but --
--	the Mustang comes SCREAMING IN REVERSE TOWARDS him!
Blade makes a SUPER-HUMAN LEAP over the speeding car.
Momentarily upside down, he FIRES through the windshield and
engine block as he flips.
Within the car, the vampires ASH.
The Mustang EXPLODES.
flipping over and --
--	Blade, now facing frontward again, continues to FIRE as he
lands, aiming at --
THE TALON AND THE CHOPPERS,
which haul ass out of the parking lot, swerving into the
traffic on the street beyond.
Blade KEEPS FIRING until he's out of bullets.
Then --
ELLINGSON (O.S.)
No more bullets, Blade?
Guess it's time
for you to fall down and go boom.
FOUR STRANDED VAMPIRES,
from the conflagration, their clothes still smoking, surround
Blade.
Call them EMOND, DOH, DENLINGER, and ELLINGSON.
Blade holsters his MACH pistols.
Then reaches for a wicked
looking CHAIN-KNIFE strapped to his thigh.
The knife has a
button on either side of the hilt.
As Ellingson RUSHES him --
-- Blade triggers the first button.
ZZZING!
The knife-blade
ejects from the hilt, trailing outward six feet on a razored
chain.
The blade penetrates Ellingson's chest.
He GASPS as
he starts to ASH.
But before his disintegration is complete --
-- Blade hits the second button.
The knife-blade retracts,
the razored chain WHIRRING back into the knife-hilt.
Blade
SPINS, triggers the first button again --
The knife-blade FLIES OUT, the razored chain whipping around
Denlinger's throat.
Blade tugs.
The razor chain cuts through
Denlinoer's neck, decapitates him. As he ASHES --
-- Blade triggers the knife again.
As it ejects, he whirls it
over his head, making a sound like a BULL-ROARER.
Blade drops low, swinging the razored chain.
The chain slices
through Emond's legs.
Emond's amputated legs ASH, the rest of
him tumbling onto the asphalt.
He SCREAMS.
Blade retracts the knife-blade, whirls, THRUSTS it through
Doh's abdomen. who was coming up from behind.
As Doh ASHES,
Blade returns to Emond, finishing him off --
-- and Blade is on the move again, RUSHING after the vampires
who escaped.
The bike-riding vamps cut across traffic, then SCREAM down an
on-ramp to a busy street below.
BACK TO BLADE,
sprinting from the parking lot to the sidewalk.
He touches a
hand to his ear.
We SEE a tiny receiver tucked within.
BLADE
Whistler!
I'm on the Stonebridge
overpass at Clemons --
WHISTLER'S VOICE
Got it!
Heading eastbound, I'm just
beneath you --
Blade dodges past a HONKING car, stepping onto and over the
trunk, then leaps atop the safety rail of the overpass as --
A BIG-RIG CAB
hauling a semi-trailer THUNDERS beneath the overpass, sounding
its AIR HORN.
It has safety cables running along the
perimeter of the trailer roof, like an aircraft carrier.
WHISTLER'S VOICE
-- GO!!!
Blade LAUNCHES HIMSELF into the air.
He lands atop the semi,
then tumbles, nearly slipping off the edge as he --
-- snags one of the safety cables atop the trailer!
He
dangles above the asphalt then SWINGS himself into the open
back of the trailer.
We HOLD for a beat, then hear the
THUNDERCLAP of a high-performance ENGINE turning over as --
BLADE'S MATTE-BLACK DODGE CHARGER
ROCKETS out of the back of the trailer, sailing right over a
car that was tail-gating the semi, heading into three lanes of
on-coming traffic at fifty miles an hour!
Blade hits the brakes, sending the battle-scarred muscle car
into a spin, clipping other vehicles in the process.
Hyper-speed.
The Charger jets forward as the NOS nitrous
system boosts the car's speed by another 300 HP, leaving any
and everything in its dust.
In seconds, it has caught up to --
STONE AND CAMPBELL
They draw TEC-9s, FIRING back at Blade.
The bullet-proof
windshield holds as do the kevlar body panels protecting the
engine -- but the rounds chew the shit out of the bodywork.
The Charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat,
causing Stone and Campbell to rear-end Blade.
The vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like
crash-test dummies.
Stone SMASHES through Blade's back
windshield, continuing into the front seat--
-- while Campbell tumbles over Blade's roof and across his
hood, somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield
wipers at the last minute.
-- right into the path of an oncoming bus!
WHAM!
Stone is
ground to paste and --
The Talor is up ahead, weaving in and out of traffic.
Fighting to see, Blade accelerates, gaining ground --
The VAMPIRE DRIVER leans out of his own wihdow, looking back
at Blade, FIRING an AUTOMATIC PISTOL --
Roof-mounted UV DAYLIGHTS come on, bathing the car ahead and
(more importantly) the vampire driver with UV LIGHT!
The vampire at the wheel SHRIEKS, ASHES, leaving the car
driverless.
Gedge tries to lean over and take the wheel --
--	Blade SLAMS his charger into the Talon.
The cars briefly
lock, grinding SPARKS.
Then they disengage.
Blade jerks his
steering wheel, gives the Talon ANOTHER SLAM.
The Talon hits the curb, riding halfway up onto a sidewalk,
PLOWING DOWN newspaper vending machines and table-top displays
piled with cheap wares, then a phone booth, a food cart.
PEDESTRIANS duck for cover and --
-- the Talon gets some serious air, ROLLING onto its side as
it comes back to earth.
--WK-KRUNCH-- the wreck skids to a stop against a streetlight.
The streetlight CREAKS, CRASHES DOWN on the wreck.
BYSTANDERS
gather, murmuring amongst themselves --
Gedge drags his bleeding body from the wrecked Talon.
He
staggers to his feet, clutching a pistol, limps away --
BLADE'S CHARGER
pulls up.
Blade climbs out, shotgun in hand.
The shotgun has
an under-mounted stake launcher.
Blade FIRES at --
-- Gedge.
The stake hits him in the back.
KNOCKING him onto
the street.
Bystanders SCREAM, falling back, taking cover --
Blade approaches, puzzled.
Gedge is still alive, LAUGHING.
He looks at Blade, eyes crazed, flashing his fangs.
BLADE
Staked you with silver.
Why aren't you
ash?
Gedge coughs blood, struggles to speak:
GEDGE
Why aren't you smarter?
Not a vampire,
dumbshit -- set your sorry ass up --
Gedge tugs at his fangs.
They're fake, PROSTHETIC.
Gedge is
looking past Blade.
Blade turns, looking up --
A ROOFTOP ABOVE
Danica is perched there.
She backs into the shadows.
But
Blade doesn't have time to investigate because --
--	POLICE SIRENS are drawing near.
Blade retreats to his
charger.
He GUNS it, speeding away as we --
CUT TO:
Blade's Charger pulls up to a boat house at the water's edge.
Blade climbs out, disappears inside.
WHISTLER (O.S.)
What the fuck happened tonight?
Establishing.
SUPER TITLE: FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS
WOMAN'S VOICE
It was horrible.
The one car crashed, and
then the guy in the coat was shooting the
other guy --
Whistler exits the store, perusing the tabloid as he walks.
We hear the WHIR of a camera's HIGH-SPEED MOTOR DRIVE and --
A SERIES OF DIGITAL SHOTS
capture Whistler as he moves down the sidewalk.
ANGLE ON AN FBI AGENT
perched on a nearby roof, taking surveillance photos.
FBI AGENT
Subject is heading West.
WHIP-PAN to a parked CAR, Cumberland and Hale seated within.
CUMBERLAND
Got him.
Cumberland starts the car, starts following Whistler.
WHISTLER (0.S.)
Congratulations.
You're famous.
Just
what we needed.
It's rush hour and the streets are choked with traffic.
PEOPLE mill past on the crowded sidewalk.
We move from face to face, capturing brief portraits of
working-class desperation -- an OVERWEIGHT GUY, a PAIR OF
HOMELESS TEENAGERS, an ASIAN VENDOR, a STREETWALKER.
VOICE (O.S)
How about that one?
SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
No fatties.
They taste like Cheetos.
THIRD VOICE (O.S.)
What about that shrunken apple-head
beeyatch-a-saurus over there?
VOICE (O.S.)
Fucking blow me, man!
We hear LAUGHTER and we WHIP-PAN over to a grimy office
building, ZIPPING UP the face of it to --
A ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE
A SKATE-PUNK (SQUID) gets some air, flipping his board up into
a nice Ollie backside grab, then scoots over to --
-- THREE MORE PUNKS perched on a concrete ledge, watching the
people below them.
They are: PROOF, FLICK and DINGO.
All in
their teens, sporting copious piercings and tattoos.
Flick
wears a ratty T-shirt from "The Lost Boys" movie.
DINGO
C'mon, just pick one.
PROOF
Once you buy a prize, it's yours and
yours to keep.
They keep looking.
Then, Flick suddenly points, excited --
FLICK
Got it, got it!
Baby on board!
ANGLE ON A MOUSY WOMAN (ABIGAIL)
moving below, her figure camouflaged beneath layers of
clothing.
She's in her 20s, lugging a NEWBORN in a BabyBjorn
carrier that's strapped to her chest, clutching a bag of
groceries in either hand.
She looks a little haggard.
As we watch, she reaches an elevated rail station entrance.
BACK TO THE SKATE-PUNKS
Dingo nods and smiles approvingly.
DINGO
Looks like we got ourselves a combo meal.
A series of shots as Abigail makes her way into the station,
passing a few other PEOPLE here and there.
Cop cruisers, unmarked cars, and SWAT trucks sweep in, SIRENS
blaring, disgorging a small army of POLICE and FBI AGENTS.
POLICE BOATS are pulling up to the dock.
AGENTS CUMBERLAND AND HALE
emerge from an unmarked, wearing bullet-proof vests,
brandishing firearms.
Cumberland barks orders into a radio.
CUMBERLAND
Lock it down!
Keep them contained!
On the rooftops above, various SWAT SNIPERS take position.
From their vantage point below, Cumberland and the others can
hear the explosions. Cumberland is on his radio, SHOUTING:
CUMBERLAN D
What's going on in there?
AGENT'S VOICE
(over radio)
Some kind of self-destruct program!
They're fragging their hard drives!
CRASH!
The three of them come FLYING DOWN in a spray of
glass, landing atop one of the police cruisers below.
The
roof buckles under their weight, windows SHATTERING --
CUMBERLAND
Take him down!
An FBI AGENT raises a CODA net gun atop his shoulder, taking
aim.
BA-BANG!
Four projectiles expand out from the barrel,
carrying a STEEL NET which has been strung between them.
The netting hits Blade, wrapping around him, restricting his
movements.
Immediately, a small army of agents DIVE on top of
him, PUMMELING AWAY, trying to beat him into submission --
CLOUDS OF FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS MUSHROOM OUTWARD, catching
all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane
force.
In the midst of the conflagration --
-- Blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors --
BLADE
WHISTLER!!!
-- but the wall of FIRE and LIGHT is rushing onward, sweeping
up everything in its path, turning the world to white.
Abigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non-UV arrow in
her bow.
She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly --
SHUNKT!
The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye.
He goes down,
his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background
as the Land Cruiser speeds away.
The Land Cruiser rockets away, disappearing into the night.
The Land Cruiser moves across an abandoned lot towards the
weed-choked ruins of an old amusement park.
We pass by the
skeletal remains of a roller-coaster, a tilt-a-whirl, the
vandalized and wood-rotted remnants of a carousel.
Finally, the Land Cruiser turns towards a motorized loading
door in the side of a large warehouse and disappears inside.
We soar through the night sky, diving down towards a cluster
of gleaming, high-tech spires.
As we isolate a penthouse
apartment atop one of them we hear an ANGRY SCREAM.
DANICA (O.S.)
Fucking Hannibal King!
FLASH!
We see the man we met earlier (DRACULA/DRAKE) on the
banks of the river Euphrates, striding towards us, engaged in
fierce battle with UBAIDIAN SOLDIERS.
He's clutching the same
sword we saw in the ziggurat, clad in the same armor.
KING (V.0.)
Dracula's only one of the names he's gone
by.
Now they call him Drake.
If you
believe the legends, he was born in
ancient Sumeria.
As Drake SLASHES his sword downward we CUT BACK TO --
FLASH!
We are in Egypt now, circa 1650 BC.
Drake wages war
against the HYKSOS.
He is closer to the camera.
And will
continue to move closer with each successive flashback.
KING (V.0.)
Every single vampire -- every single
monster that's walked the earth since then
-- owes their existence to Him.
FLASH!
The Peloponnesian War, Southern Thrace, circa 405 BC.
We see Dracula battling ATHENIANS.
Even closer now, his face
spattered with blood.
At the same time, the SOUNDTRACK is
gradually swelling, expanding in complexity and volume.
KING (V.0.)
-- read between the lines --
FLASH!
5th century AD, battling the GOTHS.
With every swipe
of his sword, we WIPE FORWARD into the future.
KING (V.0.)
-- you'll find countless references to
Him.
Always mentioned, never named.
FLASH!
8th century AD, the reign of Charlemagne.
Battling
the VIKINGS.
The FLASHBACKS come faster now, assaulting us
with ever-increasing rapidity.
Drake continues striding forward while the rest of the world
evolves around him, centuries whizzing by via computer
generated time-lapse photography.
KING (V.0.)
He's been there --
FLASH!
12th century AD, the time of the Crusades.
The
violence intensifies.
KING (V.0.)
-- moving behind the scenes --
FLASH!
17th century France, the time of Louis the XIV.
The
pace becomes breathless.
KING (V.0.)
-- cutting a bloody path through the Ages
until suddenly --
FLASH!
18th century Russia, the time of Peter the Great.
The
soundtrack is THUNDEROUS.
Drake has become a bloody blur of
bestial rage and unfettered horror and --
KING (V.0.)
-- just like that --
Grime.
Neon.
Near-silence as the cacophonous soundtrack
recedes into the background, replaced by the steady drone of
inner-city TRAFFIC.
ON DRAKE,
viewed through a long-lens, clad in modern, casual attire,
striding in SLOW-MOTION down a PEDESTRIAN-CHOKED sidewalk.
Slower.
A HEARTBEAT.
The pulse of the people.
And over
this, intruding, the Doppler effect WAILING of an approaching
car as it rushes past us in a SCREEN WIPE until we are --
OUTSIDE A GOTH STORE
Drake studies a window display.
Halloween merchandise.
Costumes and monster masks and -- VAMPIRE NOVELTIES.
We see
vampire lunchboxes, Dracula plush dolls, plastic fangs, key
chains.
Even Dracula bobbleheads.
Drake stands in stark contrast to the mass-marketed caricature
on display before him.
CRASH!
Goth Guy comes flying through the display window, his
trajectory taking his body clear across the street and into
the display window of the store opposite us.
DRAKE's ROAR echoes through the canyons of downtown.
CUT TO:
Time-lapse.
The sun rises over the decrepit amusement park.
Establishing.
The Sun at it's zenith
-- Blade, King, and Abigail cruise the streets in a jagged
fast-forward montage.
The Land Cruiser jumps the curb, SCREECHING to a stop in front
of a scuzzy bar.
Amidst a wall covered with graffiti and
flyers we see a vampire glyph.
--	STUMBLING right into Abigail's arms.
She trips him up,
swinging him around, pinning an arm behind him.
She pulls the
back of his collar down, sees a VAMPIRE GLYPH --
We can't hear what the familiar is saying, but he's squealing,
raising his hands in a "please don't hit me anymore" manner.
The Land Cruiser rockets down the streets.
In quick succession we see a half-dozen underworld dives --
-- a pool hall --
-- an internet cafe --
-- an electronics repair shop --
All are fronts for vampire operations, featuring back rooms
with refrigerated blood and high-tech coffin-like beds where
the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested.
In each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to
oldfashioned strong-arm tactics:
-- Blade HEAD-BUTTS a familiar.
-- King PUNCHES a familiar across the jaw.
-- Abigail KICKS a familiar in the stomach.
Cut to a flurry of EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of VAMPIRE GLYPHS being
exposed on the backs of familiar's necks, one after another --
THEN A MONTAGE OF FACES
as familiars have their heads cainfully SMASHED against --
-- walls --
-- car hoods --
-- pool tables --
-- into windows and doors and garbage cans.
The bullying moves come faster, the shots becoming more and
more abstract until --
-- WHAM!
Blade tosses HOOP, a skinny familiar, off a roof.
It's a four story drop.
Hoop falls, SCREAMING -- but then
jerks to a stop about twenty feet down, dangling upside down.
We see now that Hoop has rope tied around one of Hoop's
ankles.
And Blade is clutching the other end of the rope.
Blade hauls Hoop back up -- but still keeps him dangling
upside down.
King and Abigail look on.
BLADE
Want another spin, ass-hole?
Eventually,
your head's gonna pop off.
HOOP
Shit!
Oh Jesus, please, please --
BLADE
Who's your handler?
HOOP
I don't know his name, I swear I --
Blade prepares to drop Hoop again --
-- but a CELL PHONE in Hoop's jacket RINGS.
Blade fishes it
out.
The screen reads:
EDGAR VANCE, 555-5631.
Dr. Vance, the psychiatrist who gave Blade the mental
evaluation, is cruising in his Pacific Blue XKB convertible
Jaguar.
He's wearing sunglasses, talking on his cell phone.
VANCE
This is Dr. Vance.
Did someone page me?
CITY ROOFTOP - DAY
Blade ends the call, then looks to Hoop, smiling cruelly.
Blade lets Hoop drop.
The familiar PLUNGES four stories,
SCREAMING.
Lands dead-center in a Goodwill box below.
CUT TO:
A high-tech office complex surrounded by meticulously-groomed
grounds.
A sign with a swanky "VANCE INSTITUTE" logo zooms.
Blade, King, and Abigail approach, taking note of Vance's
Jaguar (complete with vanity plate), parked in front.
KING
Hey, Blade -- why didn't the vampire bite
Mick Jagger?
(off Blade's look)
Cause you can't get blood from a Stone.
As Blade walks off --
KING (CONT'D)
Hey, they can't all be gems!
Drake runs with inhuman speed.
He effortlessly scales a chain
link fence, then BARRELS straight through a wooden barricade,
sailing over a trash dumpster.
Seconds later, Blade follows,
catching sight of Drake rushing out into --
-- a crowded urban market.
What unfolds is a foot-chase at
super-human velocity.
Vampire and hunter are moving at least
twenty miles an hour, BATTERING ASIDE various pedestrians,
SMASHING through and over stalls of merchandise.
Drake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes
of rush-hour traffic WHIZZING PAST.
Abruptly, Drake cuts into the traffic, LEAPING atop the hood
of an oncoming car.
The car's HORN sounds, brakes SQUEAL.
BLADE FOLLOWS,
jumping onto the hood of another car. More
HORNS sound.
In this manner. Drake and Blade race across the flowing
traffic itself. using the hoods and roofs of the cars like
moving stepping stones.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET
Drake mounts the steps of an older apartment building,
THUNDERS his way through the main entrance --
Cut onto the fire escape.
A glimpse of Drake overhead.
Blade clambers up the fire escape, moving in a near-blur.
One
story of steps up the rickety metal ladder --
SMASH!
A LARGE PLANTER comes down from above, nearly striking
Blade.
He lets go with one hand, swings outward --
-- then he's climbing again.
A CLOUD OF PIGEONS take wing,
flapping frenetically about him, momentarily blinding him.
Another story, a third, a fourth.
As he reaches the top,
Blade jumps, catching the edge of the roof above him --
-- FLIPPING himself over and onto the roof.
He lands in a cat
stance, drawing his sword, quickly scanning the area.
DRAKE (O.S.)
So you're the hunter they all fear.
Blade spins --
DRAKE
stands on the ledge of the roof, cradling an INFANT in his
arms.
In the full glare of the afternoon sun.
DRAKE
(re: infant)
Just so we understand each other,
Daywalker.
With his free hand, he massages his jaw.
We hear a few more
Pieces of POPPING CARTKAGE as the very last of Drake's
cermanent features seem to settee into clace.
BLADE
Why did you kill Vance?
DRAKE
He'd outlived his purpose.
He'd become a
liabi1ity.
Drake nods at Blade's sword --
DRAKE
Your sword -- I've seen that hilt before.
Eight or nine centuries ago.
The hunter
who carried it was an accomplished
fighter.
Drake in his armor, head to head with a 14th century VAMPIRE
HUNTER.
The hunter has BLADE'S SWORD.
Drake tears the sword
from the hunter's grasp, turns it around, thrusts it back
through the man's chest.
And as the man GASPS we are --
-- back to here and now.
DRAKE
He was honorable, in his own way.
He
died a good death.
BLADE
I wouldn't know about that.
DRAKE
You lie.
You're part of a grand
tradition, Blade.
You hunters have
plagued my people since the day we first
walked the earth.
And I have vanquished
them.
One by one.
Blade pauses, looking for some kind of opening.
BLADE
How can you exist in the daylight?
DRAKE
I've always been able to.
Haven't you
read Mr. Stoker's fable?
I was the first
of the vampires.
I am unique.
BLADE
(realizing)
That's why they brought you back.
DRAKE
Yes.
My children seek to isolate the
properties in my blood that make me immune
to sunlight.
Through me, they believe
they can all become Daywalkers.
Drake glances down at the street people.
Throngs of PEOPLE
are massing there, pointing up at him.
DRAKE
The world's changed much since I went to
sleep.
How crowded it's become.
Look at
them down there.
Lives brief as
fireflies.
Do you think they can ever
grasp what it means to be immortal like
us?
BLADE
You're not immortal.
I must've heard a
hundred of you people make the same claim.
And every one of them's seen the end of my
sword.
Drake smiles, intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent.
DRAKE
Perhaps I will as well, then.
But I think
it's more likely that you will fall before
mine.
(beat)
Catch.
Drake tosses the infant at Blade.
Blade twists around to
catch it, scooping it safely up.
But when he looks back --
-- Drake is gone.
KING (O.S.)
Shit!
Moving towards the mirrored windows we hear LABORED BREATHING.
A high-tech research park.
The real Blade and Abigail are returning.
The sliding garage
door opens and the Land Cruiser glides inside.
Abigail's SCREAM ECHOES over the moonlit cityscape.
Caulder pulls up in front of a fish supply store.
We hear the RUMBLE of two motorcycles.
Blade emerges from the
alley astride his signature Ducati ST2 crotch-rocket.
Abigail
appears a moment later on her own customized bike.
Blade revs his engine.
Then the two bikes take off.
CUT TO:
An EXPLOSION OF GLASS as two of the vampire rottweilers tumble
into the night.
They fall like stones -- twenty stories down
into the traffic-clogged intersection below.
FADE IN FROM WHITE.
We see the sky, the burning orb of the
rising sun.
A trio of FBI helicopters ride out from the dawn,
swooping down over the stirring city.
ABIGAIL (V.0.)
It didn't take long for the authorities
to arrive.
As the helicopters touch down in the plaza we see a small
convoy of POLICE and FBI VEHICLES converging around them.
Cumberland and Hale are among the first out.
They rush
towards the Phoenix Towers entrance, guns drawn, DOZENS OF
AGENTS and OFFICERS behind them.
A bright summer day.
Blade stands at the edge of a cliff,
looking out over a sun-struck ocean.
For the first time since
we've seen him, he's not wearing armor or sunglasses or
handguns or rifles.
And were it not for the sword he holds,
we might even mistake him for an ordinary man.
ABIGAIL (V.0.)
And so Blade took it.
Blade flings his sword over the cliff, into the ocean below.
ABIGAIL (V.0.)
We never saw him again.
UNDERWATER
We see the sword sinking, reflecting the refracted sunlight
from above as it twirls end over end.
BACK TO BLADE
At peace with himself at last.
After a moment's reflection,
he turns and walks away.
ABIGAIL (V.0.)
He disappeared completely.
(beat)
But that's what heroes do.
They simply
fade out.
And in this way --
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES
as Blade moves further and further away from us, dwindling
into the horizon until he disappears entirely.
ABIGAIL (V.0.)
-- they become legends.
FADE TO BLACK.
Over darkness we hear the sound of TRAFFIC.
FADE IN.
We are moving towards a local punk dive wedged into
a crowded block in the meat packing district.
A DOORMAN (LUCIUS) stands outside, checking CUSTOMERS' IDs.We
hear HILLBILLY THRASH MUSIC coming from within.
ANGLE ON KING AND ABIGAIL
approaching.
King holds his four-barreled rifle.
Abigail
peels away, disappearing into an alley as King nears the front
door.
The doorman recognizes King, knows he's trouble.
KING
Evening Lucius.
LUCIUS
King, what the hell are you doing here?
KING
Just a little sport hunting.
