  they spank each other s butts with their racquets.  

                                CHRISTIAN
                      (spanking)
                    Hey, good backhand.  

                              ELLIE
                      (spanking)
                    Good instruction.  

                              JULES (O.S.)
                    Good morning!
                      (then, approaching)
                    Hi, I m tennis!  Uh, Jules.  Can I 
                    touch your hair?  I mean, it s just 
                    nice.

                                CHRISTIAN
                    So, Jules, will you be joining us?  

                              ELLIE
                    No, Jules has too much on her plate 
                    today.  

                              JULES
                    Actually, I rescheduled a few things. 
                    So now I have time.

                                CHRISTIAN
                    Great.  I ll be right back.     

  After Christian crosses off, Ellie pushes Jules.

                    What?  Don t be a ball hog.  

                              ELLIE
                    I ve been fake seeing him for months.  

                              JULES
                    You re married.   

                              ELLIE
                    So?  Finders keepers.

                    Finders keepers?  What, are you going 
                    to call dibs next?

  A beat, then:

                    Dibs!

                      (a second later)
                    Dibs!

                              ELLIE
                    There, it s official.  Now back off, 
                    or I ll have to embarrass you in

                    Huh, you must ve forgotten that when 
                    you get competitive, you start 
                    grunting like a linebacker.  My

  Christian is on one side of the net, feeding balls to Jules

  lets out dude grunts.  But Jules  grunts verge on orgasmic.

  With Ellie glaring at Jules, this continues until:

                              JULES

                      (catching the ball)

  A crowd gathers in the parking lot. Andy and Grayson watch 
  Bobby whack an empty beer can off his boat with a golf club.

                    Ellie usually wears the dungarees, 
                    but it s time that you started living

                    I think you just asked two divorced

                              BOBBY

                      Christian?  I think I did something

  REVEAL: Jules lies on her back while Christian stretches her

  Andy moans and then RISES out of the of cans.  He s groggy

                    It s  can t hang , jackass.  And 
                    that s not the issue.  You re holding 
                    Bobby s hand while he hits rock 
                    bottom.  Granted, it s not a very far 
                    fall for him, but still.    

                              ANDY
                    Come on, he s just riding the wave.  

                              GRAYSON
                    I ve been where Bobby is.  He s 
                    burying his pain under a mountain of 
                    partying.  After Vivian left, I 
                    buried my pain under a mountain of 
                    young girls.  I m still doing it.  
                    Not a good example-- my life s 
                    actually pretty awesome.  But Bobby s 
                    isn t.  He s in trouble, and if you 
                    keep partying with him and he doesn t 
                    deal with this, he s going to go even 
                    deeper into a dark place where we 
                    might not be able to get him back.

  Andy watches Bobby brush his teeth, then rinse his mouth 
  with a hose.  Saddened, Andy hangs his head.  The word 
   BALD  is written on his scalp in marker.  Grayson chuckles. 

                              ANDY
                    What?

                    to use the money you pay him for your 
                       one-on-one time , to take me out on 
                    a date?  Mmmm.  I can already taste 
                    that pizza.  You know what it tastes

  Grayson (groggy) opens the door for Andy.

                              GRAYSON
                    Thank you for waking me up.  I was 
                    hoping I could experience more of 
                    this hangover.

  Ellie sprints by in the background followed by Jules.

                              JULES
                    Get back here, Ellie!

                      (regards that a beat, then:)
                    Anyway, I think you re right about 
                    Bobby.  You should tell him he s out 
                    of control.  

                              GRAYSON
                    He won t listen to me.  I judge him 
                    all the time.  It has to come from 
                    someone who supports him no matter 
                    what.  You re the idiot that gave him 
                    seed money for  Chippy Chippy Bang

                              ANDY
                    They didn t really explode, Grayson.  
                    They were just peanuts covered in Pop 
                    Rocks, and they were a good idea. 

                              GRAYSON
                    They really weren t.

                              ANDY
                    I know.  How am I supposed to look 
                    Sir Cobb-A-Lot in the face and tell 
                    him there s a chink in his armor?  

                              GRAYSON
                    While you ponder that, what can you 
                    tell me about this?  
                      (reveals chest:  SEACREST OUT )
                    Why won t it come off in the shower?

                    It s permanent marker.  You should 
                    probably start getting used to it.

  Ellie runs around a group of playing KIDS.  Jules barrels 
  through and jumps OVER a kid in a wagon.

                              JULES (CONT D)
                    And hurdles!

  The next few shots show Jules chasing Ellie down sidewalks, 
  through yards -- maybe even passing a shocked ROBBIE (the 
  kid Jules chased in the pilot).  Jules is about to catch 
  Ellie when Ellie takes a knee, as if she were injured.  

                              JULES (CONT D)
                    Oh my gosh, are you okay?

  Suddenly Ellie throws sand from a sandbox in Jules  face.  
  Jules wipes the sand away as Ellie runs around a corner.  

                              JULES (CONT D)
                    Real mature, Ellie!

  Just then Jules  phone rings.  Jules answers, out of breath:

  Ellie tiptoes through a front yard where a KID fills an

                    Travis is late.  I dragged him to 
                    this guy Dale s place to get my stuff 
                    back, which I did, but I also kind of 
                    stole Dale s dirt bike trophy.  But 
                    then Dale showed up.  Travis is tough 
                    and all, but Dale could totally take 
                    him with nunchucks and such, so we 
                    had to hide in the closet.  But I m 
                    totally over Dale now and it s all 
                    thanks to Travis, so you should 
                    probably give him some because he s 
                    basically a mega-hero stud.

                    Wow, Travis.  Sounds like you should 
                    get a medal or something.

                    What can I say?  Helping people is my 
                      anti-drug.

                    Okay, cool.  Thanks, Laurie.  
                      (Laurie exits, then to Travis)
                    I know you want to sleep with her.
