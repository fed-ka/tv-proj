      Full moon - a mantle of stars. SIKES, in shirt sleeves, 
      looks through Cathy's telescope toward the night sky. CATHY 
      stands next to him. Near them are some wine and sour milk. 
      A radio plays romantic MUSIC.

                    I got it - I got Space Lab.

                                  CATHY
                    Let me see!

      He makes way for her to look through the telescope.

                                  CATHY
                    Oh... look at it!
                            (checks her watch)
                    We've got three minutes 'til they test the 
                      communications laser.

                    A space station - it's so incredible. Seems 
                    like they just put a man on the moon. You 
                    must be proud, too - a Newcomer astronaut.
                            (sighs)
                    Guy must be having a trip up there.

      Cathy looks at Sikes, feeling his wistfulness.

                    I'm like every kid in America. We all wanna 
                    be astronauts.

                    "To boldly go where no man has gone 
                    before."

      His words hang in the air between them. They look at each 
      other, then up at the sky, then back at one another again. 
      Beat. Sikes shivers slightly from the cold.

                                  CATHY
                    You're cold. You should've taken a jacket.

      She reaches for his arm - her touch is electrifying to him. 
      Noticing his reaction, Cathy becomes aware of the sexual 
      tension between them.

      CLOSE - SIKES looks in her eyes.

      CLOSE - CATHY is shy under his gaze. She looks down.

      SIKES lifts her chin.

                                  SIKES
                    Cathy... ?

      Beat. Taking the plunge, Sikes leans forward, and kisses 
      her. Cathy enjoys the sensation, but is awkward with the 
      mechanics. Her eyes blink. Sikes caresses her cheek, moving 
      his hand toward the back of her neck. Touching her hairless 
      nape, Sikes is reminded of the difference between them. He 
      opens his eyes, then pulls back.

                                  CATHY
                    I don't feel like a human woman, do I?

                                  SIKES
                    No... not really... but that's okay.

                                  CATHY
                    So, you liked it?

                                  SIKES
                    Did you?

                                  CATHY
                    I think so.

                    I feel... strange.

      They stare at one another, both unsettled.

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah.

                                  CATHY
                    The laser test is going to start.

      Sikes doesn't know whether he's relieved or disappointed.

                                  SIKES
                    Right.

      Cathy turns back to the telescope. Sikes looks at Cathy, 
      drawn to her, yet confused.


      MARILYN HOUSTON walks to her car, accompanied by BUCK, his 
      human classmate NOAH RAMSEY and several other students.

                    I was at the faculty meeting - Mr. Fisher 
                    presented the new "approved" reading lists. 
                    The school board, because of political 
                    pressure, is banning Salinger, Flaubert, 
                    Camus...

                                  BUCK
                    Camus? You mean we can't read "L'Etranger"?

                                    MARILYN
                    Not in school.

                    Lay what?

                                    MARILYN
                    "The Stranger" - a pivotal book in 
                    twentieth century literature - which the 
                    school board considers "subversive."

                                  BUCK
                    I loved that book!

                    In our history class, you know what's 
                    required reading now? 'My Turn" by Nancy 
                    Reagan.
                            (stops; to all)
                    Listen, out of school, your time is your

                    you want.                                  BUCK

                                  NOAH
                            (laughs uneasily)
                    Let's just keep the books short, okay?

                                    MARILYN
                    How bout day after tomorrow.

                                  NOAH
                    That's good - I'll be there.

                                    MARILYN
                    Oh, Buck, I wanted to tell you, your essay 
                    on Whitman as the zeitgeist of Post Civil 
                    War America was really well thought out. 
                    Very sophisticated.

                                  BUCK
                    Thanks.

                                  NOAH

                    Hey, I know mine's late - my hard disk 
                    crashed. I'll get it to you tomorrow.
                            (upbeat)
                    It's about the Alamo.

                                    MARILYN
                    I look forward to it, Noah.

                                  BUCK
                    Can we start with Flaubert? I hear "Madame 
                    Bovary" is great.

                                    MARILYN
                    Oh, that's my favourite book - yes!

      Noah sees the connection between Buck and Marilyn, and he 
      resents it.


      George and Sikes walk down the gangway to the boat slips. 
      Surrounded by sea water, George is tense as he walks on the 
      floating dock.

      Marilyn, Buck and Noah sit on the grass, enjoying the 
      remains of a picnic. Buck and Noah have paperback copies of

                    For all of Emma's silliness - her bourgeois 
                    values - she's ultimately a sympathetic 
                    character - a victim of her society.

                                  BUCK
                    Yeah. Like everybody else - she wasn't 
                    satisfied with what she had.

                                    MARILYN
                    Right. Her sense of worth came only from 
                    material possessions or social status - not 
                    from anything internal.

                                  BUCK
                    But Flaubert's writing was so good, you 
                    really understood her. I also read

      Bukowski bags trash on a hillside bridal trail. Looking up 
      he sees:

      SIKES AND GEORGE approaching with a park ranger who's 
      pointing Bukowski out to them.

      BUKOWSKI knows this is trouble. He starts retreating.

      But: BUKOWSKI leaps off the trail down the side of the 
      hill.

      SIKES rushes toward him. George runs back to their car. As 
      Sikes reaches the edge of the hill. He sees:

      peels out.

      PARK ROAD - BUKOWSKI on the racing bike, flies. George's

      He yanks the wheel.

      THE CAR follows BUKOWSKI into a tunnel.

      George floors it, turning the wheel hard again.

      THE CAR barrels down the road, screeching as it cuts 
      Bukowski off.

      CLOSE - BUKOWSKI reacts to the car blocking his path. He 
      tries to brake, but it's too late.

      THE BIKE hits the car, catapulting Bukowski up and over the

      BUKOWSKI lands in the brush.

                                  CATHY
                    I care so much for you, Matt. But whenever 
                    we're together, I sense you looking at me 
                    and I feel incomplete - like I should have 
                    hair and ears and eat the food you do and 
                    make love the way you do.
                            (beat)
                    I come away feeling like there's something 
                    wrong with me. But there isn't.
                            (gesturing to herself)
                    This is what I am. A Tenctonese - an alien.
                            (beat)
                    You're right. We are different. And I don't 
                    think you can ever love those differences.                                  SIKES
                            (starting to protest)
                    Cathy -

                                  CATHY
                            (cutting him off)
                    Don't, Matt.

      Joshua's car pulls up.

                                  SIKES
                    This isn't fair to me.

                                  CATHY
                    We are what we are. Nothing would change.
                            (touches his cheek)
                    It's all right.

      Turning away, she starts toward the car. Sikes wants to 
      call her back, but doesn't know what else to say.

      CATHY suppresses tears as she moves to the car.


      Sunset. Buck waits on a bench just off a footpath. Glancing 
      at his watch, he looks down the path. His face lights up,       seeing:

      HIS POV - MARILYN coming toward him.

      BUCK gets up to meet her.

                                  BUCK
                    I was afraid I got the day wrong.

                                    MARILYN
                    I'm sorry I'm late, Buck.

                                  BUCK
                    That's okay.
                            (excited)
                    I just read this really great book - 
                    "Catcher in the Rye." You know it?

                                    MARILYN
                            (smiles)
                    Yeah. I loved it when I was your age, too.

                                  BUCK
                    I'm gonna read all of Salinger. We could 
                    talk about him at our next session.

                                    MARILYN
                    Buck, there isn't going to be a next 
                    session. Someone reported to Mr. Fisher 
                    that you and I are... having an affair.

                                  BUCK
                    What?!

                                    MARILYN
                    I have to transfer schools.

                                  BUCK
                    Why?! It's not true.

                                    MARILYN
                    Mr. Fisher will take it to the school board 
                    if I don't transfer.

                                  BUCK
                    Let him! We'll fight it!                                    MARILYN
                    This is my job - I could lose my license. 
                    And even if I win, I'll never live it down. 
                    People will always wonder - they'll always 
                    be suspicious.

                                  BUCK
                    You're just gonna give in?

                                    MARILYN
                    You don't need this either - it could get 
                    very ugly.

                                  BUCK
                    I don't care. You're the one who's always 
                    saying you gotta fight for what's right.

                                    MARILYN
                    Not this time. I can't.

                                  BUCK
                    I don't understand... .

                                    MARILYN
                            (extending her hand)
                    Buck, I want you to know what a pleasure 
                    it's been having you as a student...

                                  BUCK
                            (refusing to shake hands)
                    Why are you talking to me like this?
                            (imitating her)
                    "What a pleasure it's been." You act like 
                    we hardly know one another.

                                    MARILYN
                            (turning)
                    I gotta go.

                                  BUCK
                    Marilyn!
                            (when she turns back)
                    Why?

      She stares into his passionate, questioning eyes.                                    MARILYN
                            (beat)
                    Because, it could happen.
                            (stepping closer)
                    I want it to happen.

      She kisses him. Unused to this human act, Buck is at first 
      confused. But as their embrace continues, he is swept up by 
      desire and returns Marilyn's kiss with equal passion.
