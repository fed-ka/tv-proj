      A bustling hive of activity -- COPS, DETECTIVES, PERPS and 
      LAWYERS all zipping about -- through the throng, we find:

      IRIS -- 25, a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN -- carrying a TAKE-OUT 
      TRAY OF COFFEE, a LAPTOP BAG slung over her shoulder -- 
      everyone knows her, says hi, as she makes her way --

                                  UNIFORMED OFFICER 
                    Hey, Iris!  One of those for me?

                                  IRIS
                    Not with your ulcer, Forrest.

                                  DET. CHYRE
                    I don t know, Iris.  Your Rockets 
                    aren t looking so good.  Not sure 
                    they can cover the spread.

                                  IRIS
                    Keep betting those paychecks on the 
                    Combines, Chyre.  You ll be able to 
                    retire when you re ninety.  

      Iris reaches Det. West -- puts one coffee on his desk -- and 
      we suddenly get why she s well known at the station house --

                                  IRIS
                    Hi, Dad.

                    Shouldn t you be in class?

                                  IRIS
                    I have the week off to work on my 
                      dissertation.  I picked up some 
                    extra shifts at the coffee shop.  
                    Found myself in possession of a 
                    double cap, no foam, one sugar.  

                                  DET. WEST
                          (re: other cup)
                    If that s a decaf tea for Barry, 
                    drop it off and then leave.  He s 
                    working and he s in trouble.       

                                  IRIS
                    When isn t Barry working... or in 
                    trouble?


      CLOSE ON: CHEMICALS TILTING BACK AND FORTH -- WIDEN TO REVEAL 
      Barry at his work station -- analyzing evidence -- FAST FOOD 
      by his side -- as Iris enters -- Barry s eyes light up -- 

                                  IRIS
                    Okay, I m ready to see the Atom 
                      Smasher... smashing.

                                  BARRY
                    There was a shooting today.  Your 
                    dad needs me to process some 
                    evidence.  Which means I don t know 
                    if we can go to S.T.A.R. Labs.  

                                  IRIS
                    But seeing this thing go on is like 
                    your dream.  Your sad little, nerdy  
                    dream.

                                  BARRY
                    I prefer  geek  to  nerd. 

                                  IRIS
                    They re the same thing.  

                                  BARRY
                    Not if you met a real  nerd  --  
                    Um, those... are my fries.

      Iris is half way into Barry s fast food --

                    I m stress eating over my 
                      dissertation.  We started selling 
                    Cronuts at Jitters.  I ate two

                    If I don t graduate soon, I m going 
                    to be more muffin top than woman.

                    Please.  You look amazing.  

      The way Barry looks at her -- it s clear he s smitten -- 

                                  IRIS
                    Which would be a compliment, except 
                    you re Barry.  Which means your 
                    opinion of my looks is meaningless.

      Iris looks out the window at the skyline -- another shot of   
      -- the world s grandest testament to science: S.T.A.R. LABS

                                  IRIS
                    What s so important about this 
                    Particle Accelerator anyway?   

                                  BARRY
                    Only everything.  Harrison Wells  
                    work in Quantum Theory is light 
                    years ahead of anything they re 
                    doing at CERN.  

                                  IRIS
                    You re doing that thing where 
                    you re not speaking English.

      Barry goes to the DRY ERASE BOARD -- DRAWS A DOT -- 

                                  BARRY
                    Imagine this dot is everything the 
                    Human race has ever learned until 
                    this moment.  

                                  IRIS
                    Does that include twerking?

      Undeterred, Barry DRAWS a GIANT CIRCLE around the dot -- 

                                  BARRY
                    That is everything we can learn 
                    from the particle accelerator.  
                    It s a whole new way of looking at 
                    physics.

                    It will change the way we think 
                    about... everything.  From a single 
                    atom, to an entire galaxy.

                    You have got to get yourself a 
                      girlfriend.

      We can see Barry wants more than anything for her to be his 
      girlfriend but then... Det. West enters --

                                  DET. WEST
                    Hey, leave him alone.  He s

                                  IRIS
                    Your test thingy is done.

      Barry looks at the screen -- eyes lighting up -- gotcha --

                    I think Mardon and his brother are 
                    hiding on a farm.  

                                  DET. WEST
                    A farm?

                                  BARRY
                    The fecal matter I found on the 
                    street next to where Mardon boosted 
                    his getaway vehicle, it was cow 
                    manure.  There are ten dairy farms 
                    within a hundred mile radius of 
                    Central City.  But there was also 
                    trace elements of Oxytetracycline, 
                    an antibiotic.  Only four farms 
                    still pump their cattle full of 
                      antibiotics.  Bet you find a really 
                    sweet Corvette parked at one.

                          (back on the clock)
                    I m sorry, Barry.  I ve got to go.

      As West heads out - Barry turns expecting Chyre -- but 
      instead -- Detective Thawne approaches -- 

                                  DET. THAWNE
                    Hey, Allen.  Glad to see you.  

                                  BARRY
                    Uh, thanks, Eddie.

      Thawne heads out, confused by her demeanor.  Something 
      catches Barry s eye on the WALL: PHOTOS of fallen officers, 
      Barry sees DETECTIVE FRED CHYRE --

                                  IRIS
                    The night of the explosion.  Clyde 
                    Mardon shot and killed Chyre.  
                    Mardon and his brother died trying 
                    to escape.  Their plane crashed.  

      Suddenly a UNI enters -- dragging in a JUNKIE in CUFFS -- 

                                  UNIFORMED OFFICER
                    Hey, Barry!  Good to see you!

                                  JUNKIE
                    Screw you!

      Barry sees the junkie grab the Uni s SIDEARM -- when -- TIME 
      SLOWS AGAIN! -- the gun aimed right at the cop -- the sound 
      slows down -- low, like a record player -- and then -- 

      The world snaps back to life -- as the Uni grabs the gun back 
      and tussles with the junkie --

                                  BARRY
                    Iris, I... uh... need some time 
                    alone.  In my lab.  I ll call you 
                    tonight.  I promise.  

      As a freaked out Barry heads up the stairs -- Off Iris...


      QUICK CUTS as Barry turns to the MINI-CAM on his COMPUTER, 
      draws BLOOD, loads a TEST TUBE OF BLOOD into an ANALYZER -- 
      looks at THE DIGITAL CLOCK on the SCREEN -- 00:00:00 -- OVER

                    Or something else...

      Barry approaches the clock --the SECOND HAND moves -- the 
      AMBIENT SOUND in the room changes -- Barry looks at the 
      computer, confused -- RECORD TIME: 00:00:01 --

      Barry hits PLAYBACK -- a BLURRED IMAGE -- A BRIEF HIGH-
      PITCHED sound -- Barry types -- PLAYBACK set at one tenth of 
      the speed -- hits PLAYBACK again -- it s still distorted, but 
      BARRY S VOICE is now audible -- and he sees himself moving 
      around the room -- impossibly -- in the blink of a second --

      Then Barry realizes -- the lab is a mess -- papers strewn, 
      chairs knocked over -- the truth now unassailable -- 

                                  BARRY

                          (a beat, never easy)
                    When I was eleven, my mother was 
                    murdered.  It was late.  A sound 
                    woke me up.  I came downstairs and 
                    I... I saw what looked like a ball 
                    of lightning.  Inside the

                    Everyone, the cops, the shrinks, 
                    they all told me what I saw was 
                      impossible.  But what if the man 
                    who killed my mother was like me?

                                  WELLS
                      Anti-matter, Dark energy, x-
                      elements...

                                  BARRY
                    Those are all theoretical.

                                    HARTLEY
                    How theoretical are you?

                                  BARRY
                    That s the real reason you kept 
                    this place open.  To find them.

                                  WELLS
                    And you were the first.

      Wells types, a MAP OF CENTRAL CITY appears on the monitor -- 
      glowing white spots blink on -- a large one in the center -- 

                                  WELLS
                    We mapped the dispersion throughout 
                    Central City, though we have no 
                    real way of identifying exactly who 
                    or what was exposed -- we ve been 
                    searching for other meta-humans 
                    like yourself.

                                  BARRY
                       Meta-humans?

                    I saw one of them today.  Clyde 
                    Mardon.  He s a bank robber.  And 
                    he can control the weather.

                    His physiology can actually affect 
                      meteorological changes?

                    It s not cool!  A man died.  Mardon 
                    must have gotten his powers the 
                    same way I did.  From the storm 
                    cloud.  And he s still out there.  
                    We have to stop him before he hurts 
                    anyone else.

                                  WELLS
                    That s a job for the police.

                                  BARRY
                    I work for the police.

                                  WELLS
                    As a forensic assistant.  I built 
                    the particle accelerator to make 
                    this city, this world a better 
                    place.  Instead, it cost me my 
                    company, my reputation...

      Everyone reacts -- all of them victims in some way --

                                  WELLS
                    ... but then I found you.  Inside 
                    your body could be the map to that 
                    new world.  Vaccines, medicines, 
                    genetic therapies... all treasures 
                    buried in your cells.  We can t 
                    risk losing everything just so you 
                    can go out and play hero.  
                          (then)
                    You re not a hero.  You re just a 
                    young man who was struck by 
                    lightning.

      Hurt beyond words, Barry leaves -- 


      Barry steps inside -- FURNITURE overturned -- FAMILY PICTURES 
      smashed -- Barry sees the CORONER and a YOUNGER, UNIFORMED 
      OFFICER WEST  -- standing over a TARP -- West spots him --

                                  DET. WEST
                    Barry, are you okay?  Where have 
                    you been?

      Barry isn t listening -- he moves closer to the tarp -- West 
      tries to stop him -- but Barry pulls it back revealing -- 

      Barry s mother -- NORA -- her eyes wide open, her face fixed 
      in fear -- murdered -- as Young Barry SCREAMS --

      Barry holds court before Hartley, Caitlin and Cisco -- 
      working off EVIDENCE PHOTOS and a LARGE MAP OF CENTRAL CITY --

                                  BARRY
                    I went over the NTSB evidence from 
                    the plane crash that supposedly 
                    killed Clyde and Mark Mardon.  
                    Neither of their bodies were 
                      recovered.  Plotting a course from 
                    their takeoff would have put them 
                    smack in the center of the energy 
                      dispersion caused by the explosion 
                    here.  They got a full taste of 
                    whatever you unleashed.  

                                    HARTLEY
                    Wells made it very clear, we are 
                    not getting involved in this.  

                                  BARRY
                    I ve been going over unsolved cases 
                    from the past nine months.  There s 
                    been a sharp increase in 
                      unexplained deaths, missing people.  
                    Your meta-humans have been busy.
                    I m not blaming you.  I know you 
                    didn t mean for any of this to 
                    happen.  I know you all lost 
                      something.   But I need your help 
                    to catch Mardon.  And anyone else 
                    out there like him. 

      Barry looks to them.  Are you guys with me?  

                                  CISCO
                    This whole city s been angry and 
                    miserable since the accident.  You 
                    might be the only good thing that 
                    came out of it.  I m with you, bro.

      Hartley turns to Caitlin -- sees she s wavering --

                                    CAITLIN
                    For the past nine months I have 
                    been coming to this place.  Where 
                    Kyle died.  I don t want anyone 
                    else to get hurt because of us.  I 
                    need losing him to mean something.

                    If you re going to do this... I 
                    have something that might help.  


      A RED UNIFORM covers a FULL FIGURE DUMMY -- its CRIMSON COWL 
      has a CLEAR COMPACT GAS MASK over the nose and mouth -- no 
      symbol -- no ear pieces -- no lightning -- this is the first 
      stage of what will one day be the iconic FLASH costume -- 
      Barry, Hartley, Caitlin and Cisco stand before it -- 

                                  BARRY 
                    What is it?

                                    HARTLEY
                    Something I ve been working on.   
                    It s designed to replace the 
                    turnouts firefighters traditionally 
                    wear.  It s made of a reinforced 
                      tri-polymer, it s heat and abrasive 
                    resistant so when you re moving at 
                      high-velocity speeds, it won t 
                    shred like your normal clothing.

                                    CAITLIN
                    At least you won t face Mardon 
                    naked.

                                    HARTLEY
                    The suit has built in sensors so we 
                    can track your vitals and stay in 
                    contact with you.

                                  BARRY
                    So you made this to help firemen?

                    Labs satellite.  Atmospheric 
                    pressure dropped 20 millibars in a 
                    matter of seconds.

      West and Thawne enter, GUNS raised -- BALES OF HAY everywhere 
      -- they see Mardon standing alone -- his back to them --

      Then, suddenly, HAY on the ground flutters from a cold breeze 
      -- the breeze becoming A HARSH WIND -- West sees his BREATH --

      As West CUFFS Mardon s hand -- the wind PICKS UP -- LIFTING 
      BALES OF HAY into the air -- SWIRLING around the barn -- 
      Thawne gets THWACKED in the head  -- KNOCKING HIM against a 
      wall -- dazing him -- 

                                  MARDON
                    Looks like you re going to need 
                    another new partner...

      Mardon KNOCKS the gun from West s hand -- the wind carrying 
      it away  -- Mardon stares at a shocked West -- 


      West shirks before the whipping wind -- Mardon unaffected -- 

                                  MARDON
                    It s getting easier to control.   I 
                    used to think a gun made me strong.  
                    But this.  This is real power.  The 
                    power of nature.  Of God.  You

                    You re right.  I ve been thinking 
                    small...

      Mardon raises his hands -- and the wind gets stronger -- West 
      scoops up the dazed Thawne and rushes them towards the door --  


      West lugs Thawne out of the barn -- rushing for safety when --

      BOOOMMM!!  The barn roof explodes into the sky!  A SECTION OF 
    THE BARN ROOF heading straight for West and Thawne --

      The cops hit the ground -- Thawne out of it -- West bracing 
      for the end -- when --

      -- a CRIMSON BLUR miraculously TACKLES the debris away from 
      the cops -- a shaken West looks up, amazed -- 

      And we finally get our first look at Barry as THE FLASH 1.0 -- 

      Barry tears off the gas mask -- which leaves the cowl with 
      its iconic design -- before West can speak -- Barry ZIPS away

                    Barry, wind speeds are 200 miles-
                    per-hour and increasing.  If it

                                  BARRY
                    I have to try.  

      Barry takes a breath.  And then runs -- ducking and dodging 
      debris -- racing towards the tornado --  

      Barry becomes a RED BLUR moving faster and faster, running 
      counter to the tornado --

      BACK IN THE CORTEX 

      The trio monitor Barry s vitals -- they re not good -- 

                                    HARTLEY
                    The suit is holding up.

                                    CAITLIN
                    But he s not.  

                                  CISCO
                    He can do it.  I know he can do it.

      But the cyclone is too powerful -- A TENDRIL whipping out -- 
      SLAMMING into Barry who SKIDS out -- out of breath -- 

                                  BARRY
                    It s too strong...    

      Mardon looks out at CENTRAL CITY in the distance -- 

                                  MARDON
                    Time to think big...

      The TORNADO begins to move -- towards the city -- Barry is 
      overwhelmed -- until he hears --

                                  WELLS (O.S.)
                    You can do this.

      Barry reacts -- IN THE CORTEX -- Wells has wheeled into the 
      Cortex, moved by Barry s heroism -- 

                                  WELLS
                            (passionate)
                    You were right.  I created this 
                    madness.  But you can stop it.  You 
                    are more than your speed.  You can 
                    do this.  

      Invigorated by Wells  words -- Barry takes off again -- this 
      time running harder -- crackling with lightning -- faster and 
      faster -- until the tornado is violently unraveled --




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      52.

      Barry on the ground, struggles to rise, pulls off his cowl -- 
      can t catch his breath -- CHAK!  Mardon stands over Barry 
      with a gun, out of power and winded himself --

                                  MARDON
                    I didn t think there was anyone 
                    else like me.

                                  BARRY
                    I m not like you.

      Barry braces for the end -- when:  BLAMM! BLAMM! BLAMM! -- 
      Mardon s body falls, dead -- Barry looks up and sees -- WEST!  

                                  CAITLIN
                    Barry?  Barry?!

                                  BARRY
                    It s okay.  I m okay.  It s over.

    IN THE CORTEX -- our team breathes a sigh of relief -- and 
    for the first time since we ve met her... Caitlin smiles.  A 
      small one.

      BACK AT THE FARM -- West slumps down beside Barry -- West, 
      finally having seen the impossible -- as the SUN BEGINS TO 
      RISE -- off the two men -- the two partners -- facing a new 
      day --

                                            ACT SIX


      Young Iris watches from the top of the stairs as Det. West in 
      officer s uniform and Young Barry enter.  West sees her.

                                  DET. WEST
                    Why aren t you asleep?

                                  IRIS
                    I was waiting for you to bring 
                    Barry home.  

                                  DET. WEST
                      Sweetheart, why don t you show 
                    Barry the guest room?  He s going 
                    to be staying with us for a little 
                    while.  I m going to go talk to 
                    Mom.     
                          (to Barry)
                    It s going to be okay, son.

      West heads upstairs -- Iris holds out her hand -- a beat 
      before Barry takes it -- looks at her -- needing someone, 
      anyone, to understand --

                                  BARRY
                    Iris, my dad... he didn t do it.

                                  IRIS
                    I believe you...

      Off the two children -- so close --


      Barry waits on one side of A TWO-WAY GLASS PARTITION -- A 
      PRISON GUARD leads in a PRISONER -- DR. HENRY ALLEN -- 
      Barry s father -- he sits as they pick up their PHONES -- 

                                  HENRY
                    Hey, slugger.  

                                  BARRY
                    I ve been worried about you.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      56.

                                  HENRY
                    Me?  You were the one in the coma.  
                    Are you doing okay? 

                                  BARRY
                    Dad, don t ask me how I know but... 
                    I know what happened to Mom now.  I 
                    mean, I don t know who killed her 
                    but I know how.  And I m going to 
                    find them and get you out of here.  

                                  HENRY
                    Barry, we ve talked about this.  
                    You need to stop worrying about me.  
                    And live your life.  

                                  BARRY
                    For the first time, I feel like 
                    maybe I can...

      INTERCUT WITH:  


      Thawne is there with Iris -- drinking coffee --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    The truth is, since the night Mom 
                    died, I ve been stuck in one place.  
                    I missed out on a lot of things...  

      Thawne gets up to pay the check, kisses Iris on the cheek  -- 
      as she looks up at a TV SCREEN showing CHANNEL 52 NEWS REPORT 
      -- The headline reads,  UNEXPLAINED DEATHS IN KEYSTONE 
      CONTINUE  -- off Iris, her curiosity piqued --


      Hartley, Cisco and Caitlin hover around the suit -- 

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    But I m different now.  I met some 
                    new people.  They re helping me 
                    find my way...   

                                    HARTLEY
                    The faster he runs, the greater the 
                      electrical discharge.  We could add 
                    metallic conducting points to help 
                    separate and safely draw off the 
                    energy.  Here and here...

      Cisco affixes A LIGHTNING BOLT SHAPED ICON to the chest --



                                                                              (CONTINUED)THE FLASH    "PILOT"   White Production Draft   2/3/14      57.

      CONTINUED:7575

                                    CAITLIN
                    Why is it shaped like a lightning 
                    bolt?

                                  CISCO
                    So it s not boring.

      As the trio bicker, Wells wheels out -- seemingly content --


      West and Barry stand before the MURDER BOARD for Barry s 
      mother -- West picks up the FILE BOX labeled  NORA ALLEN  -- 
      as the two men -- two partners -- reexamine the evidence --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    No more living in the past.  I m 
                    ready to start moving on...


      Henry s eyes moist at his son s new happiness.

                                  HENRY
                    I love you, son.

                                  BARRY
                    I love you too, Dad.

      Barry puts his hand on the glass -- his dad follows suit --

                                  BARRY (V.O.)
                    My name is Barry Allen.


      Making sure he s alone, Wells places his hand on A HIDDEN 
      SENSOR in the WALL -- scans his FINGERPRINTS -- and a SECTION 
      OF THE WALL BECOMES TRANSLUCENT AND SLIDES OPEN -- 


      Wells enters the clean and antiseptic, seemingly empty area -- 
      until SOMETHING RISES UP from the floor -- a GLASS CASE 
      containing a BLANK TABLET -- 

      And then, Wells stands up -- not paralyzed after all --

      He places his hand over the tablet which becomes a NEWSPAPER 
      FRONT PAGE -- The HEADLINE reads,  THE FLASH SAVES CENTRAL 
      CITY  -- below it is a BLURRY PHOTOGRAPH of THE FLASH -- not 
      Barry in his suit from the pilot but the finished costume 
      from the comics  -- and then we see the date:  April 25th, 
      2024 ...

      The newspaper is from a decade in the future...  

      Off Wells -- keeping secrets far greater than we could have 
      imagined...


                                        END OF PILOT
