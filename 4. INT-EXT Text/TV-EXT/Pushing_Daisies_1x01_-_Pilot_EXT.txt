      CAMERA FLIES OVER the "Welcome to Couerd'Couers" sign at
    the field's edge to FIND a bright, care-free boy of about 10
      (YOUNG NED) racing through the flowers sending petals flying
    as he chases his dog DIGBY, an adorable yellow lab as bright
    and care-free as Young Ned.  Our OMNISCIENT NARRATOR (imagine
      Patrick Stewart reading a bedtime story) begins:

                                      NARRATOR
              At this very moment in the town of Couer
                d'Couers, Young Ned was 9 years, 27
                weeks, 6 days, and 3 minutes old.

      Young Ned is only a few feet behind his dog, 3 sets of legs
      speeding through the brush.  He reaches out trying to make
      contact, but Digby is just out of touch.  Closer... closer...
      The brush gives way to a clearing.  Closer... closer, still...

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                His dog Digby was 3 years, 2 weeks, 6
                days, 5 hours and 9 minutes old.

      WHAM.  Out of nowhere, Digby is HIT BY A PASSING SEMI-TRUCK.
      A BLUR OF BIG RIG obscures the impact.  Ned stops, horrified. 

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                And not a minute older.

      TIME SLOWS TO A CRAWL.  FUR SAILS THROUGH THE AIR, as if
      Digby was taking flight by his own propulsion.  ALL SOUND
      DROPS OUT except for the RAPID, RHYTHMIC POUNDING of Ned's
      HEART and the EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION of his LUNGS.

    He approaches the unmoving body of his dead dog Digby.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                This was the moment Young Ned realized
              he wasn't like the other children.  Nor
                was he like anyone else for that matter.

    Ned kneels down beside Digby and as he reaches out to stroke
    the dog's matted fur...  CAMERA JUMP CUTS TO:

    AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NED'S FINGER

    The ridges of his fingertip look like circular troughs.  As
    Ned touches his dog we see a small STATIC POP OF ELECTRICITY
      between his finger and Digby's fur.                                                                                        2.

      CAMERA JUMPS WIDE

      TIME RESUMES TO NORMAL as Digby inexplicably scrambles to
      his feet with a happy dog-smile on his face and runs off
      into the field of daisies.

                                      NARRATOR
                Young Ned could touch dead things and
                bring them back to life.

      Young Ned watches slack-jawed and furrow-browed as Digby
      disappears over the horizon.  He stares at his finger, not
      sure exactly what just happened.

      CLOSE ON - A FLY 

      It lands on a cupboard door and darts to and fro until SMACK.
      A FLY SWATTER ends its life in one abrupt movement.  We are...


      A girl named CHUCK, pig-tails et al, plays in the back yard.

                                      NARRATOR
                Young Ned was in love.

      She's making a small village out of mounds of dirt and
      cardboard boxes with Play-Doh people and toy cars as her
      FATHER waters the lawn in the background.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                Her name was Chuck.  At this very moment,
                she was 8 years, 42 weeks, 3 hours and
                2 minutes old.                                                                                        3.

      She squeezes a little people head out of the Play-Doh Fun
      Factory and places it on the body she's already constructed.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                Young Ned did not think of her as being
                born or hatched or conceived in any
                way.  Chuck came ready made from the
                Play-Doh Fun Factory of Life.

      She makes the final few touches on her village and it COMES
      TO LIFE THROUGH THE MAGIC OF IMAGINATION.

      CHUCK'S P.O.V. - IMAGINATION REALIZED

      Large as life, TOY CARS drive through tiny streets, and TOY
      PEOPLE mill about on tiny sidewalks.

      BOOM.  BOOM.  BOOM.  BOOM.  The ground SHAKES.  The TOY PEOPLE
      react to the strangeness... then a GIANT REPTILIAN LEG STOMPS
      into a cardboard building, crushing it.

      CAMERA REVEALS A GIANT PIG-TAILED GODZILLA stomping through
      the village, sparing no one as PLAY-DOH PEOPLE SCRAMBLE. 
      And just when we think a lone TOM CRUISE-ESQUE PLAY-DOH PERSON
      has escaped... SQUISH.  A GIANT RODAN-ESQUE WINGED DINOSAUR
      looking as much like Ned as the Godzilla looks like Chuck
      (wearing the same clothes, etc.) stomps him good.

      SMASH BACK TO REALITY

      Chuck and Ned are stomping through the remains of her small
      village, having an absolute ball and getting very dirty.

      ON NED

      His Mother is sweeping the dirt off of him with a broom.


      Young Ned sits on the porch, dressed all in black.  He watches
      as Chuck's 30-something Grey Garden-esque aunts (VIVIAN and
      LILY) drag large steamer trunks into Chuck's house.

                                      NARRATOR
                Chuck was orphaned when her father died
                and fostered by her aunts Vivian and
                Lily.  A renowned synchronized swimming
                duo, they shared matching personality
                disorders and a love for fine cheese. 


    The JEWISH and CHRISTIAN GRAVEYARDS are two halves of the
      samecemetary.  The Synagogue and Church on either end of
    the hillside graveyard.  Two funerals are taking place, one
    on each side of the graveyard.

                                      NARRATOR
              At their respective parent's funerals...


    The peak of the cemetary hill.  Young Ned and the Neighbor
      Girl ENTER FRAME from their respective side, silhouetted by
    the sun.  She takes his hand and kisses him on the lips.

                                      NARRATOR
                ...dizzy with grief, curiosity and
                hormones, Young Ned and a girl named
                Chuck had their first and only kiss.

      MOMENTS LATER

      Young Ned watches the Neighbor Girl head back down the hill. 
      After a moment, Young Ned s dog Digby returns and bounds
      right up to Ned.  He reaches out to pet Digby and the dog
      pulls away.  Despite this, Digby wags his tail and smiles,
      keeping a safe distance.  As Young Ned leads Digby down the
      other side of cemetary hill, CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK...                                                                                        7.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                The effect of his Mother's death on
                Ned's psyche was twofold.  He avoided
                social attachments, fearing what he'd
              do if someone else he loved died. 
                Secondly, he became obsessed with pies.

    The setting sun shining bright and round MORPHS INTO A GOLDEN
      BROWN PIE on a cloud-print tablecloth.  We are:

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                It's 19 years, 34 weeks, 1 day and 59
                minutes later...


      A charming Parisian (in tone)/American (in style) googie-
      esque bakery.  The front of the business is rounded and given
    the facade of a giant pie wedged into the ground floors of
    an ADJACENT APARTMENT BUILDING, complete with a pie-crust
      roof.  A sign reads: The Pie Hole.

                                      NARRATOR
                ...if you crave something before you
                die I recommend where the Pie Maker
                makes his pies.


      EMERSON chases a RUNNING MAN across a rooftop.

                                      NARRATOR
                And how he came to be the sole keeper
              of the Pie Maker's secret...

      The Running Man jumps to make it to the next building and
      misses, plunging 10 stories to his death.  Emerson looks
      over the ledge to see the Running Man HIT a trash bin with a
      BONE-CRUNCHING WHAM that most definitely killed the man. 
      But he BOUNCES into a SLIGHTLY YOUNGER NED who happened to
      be emptying the trash at the time. 

      CAMERA JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP of the
      impact and we SEE the POP OF STATIC ELECTRICITY.

      CAMERA POPS WIDE as the Dead Running Man OPENS HIS EYES and
      takes off again.  Slightly Younger Ned gives chase.

      Emerson watches as Slightly Younger Ned tackles the Running
      Man and he goes limp.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                After the runaway corpse, Emerson Cod,
                a Private Investigator, proposed a
                partnership with the Pie Maker.

      CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Emerson staring, slack-jawed.

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                Murders are much easier to solve when
                you can ask the victim who killed them.

      RESUME - PIE HOLE - DAY

      Ned watches Emerson through the porthole window in the kitchen
      door.  Emerson looks up from his pie.  Their eyes connect.

                                      NARRATOR
                Since the bakery was on the verge of
                financial ruin, the Pie Maker agreed so
              he could keep his Pie Hole open.                                                                                        10.

                The facts were these... Charlotte
                Charles, 28 years, 24 weeks, 3 days, 11
                hours, and 51 minutes old, was found

      A simple, pine casket.  The lid is set in place over
      Charlotte's beautiful, lifeless body.  We don't see her face.

                Jewish law prescribes burial in a plain

                                      ACT THREE


    Ned runs across the cemetery vaulting over headstones.  He
      cuts into a road and falls into step behind the Hearse.


    Ned waves at the clouds of dust.  He sees the Hearse continue
      down the driveway until it turns onto the street, a long
      line of cars pull out behind it.

    Ned sees which direction the Hearse is heading and cuts across
    the Funeral Home yard, jumping over fences and hedges.


    The Pallbearers stop and we HEAR Chuck slide up and bump her
      head on the inside of the coffin.

                                      CHUCK'S MUFFLED VOICE
                Ow.                                                                                        28.

      Two Pallbearers react to the "Ow," glancing at one another
      over the top of the casket, each thinking it was the other.


      Ned runs as fast as he can, spying the cemetery up ahead. 
      He quickens his pace, running past the last of the mourners.


      CAMERA PUSHES IN ON YOUNGER VIVIAN AND YOUNGER LILY, their
      backs to us as they sit on the side of the pool facing very,
      very sparsely populated audience stands, mermaid fins cover
      their legs.  A SIGN READS: "The Darling Mermaid Darlings."

              No longer nursing at the teat of
                synchronized swimming stardom, their
                personality disorders blossomed into
                incapacitating social phobias.

                She never strayed far from home.  She

              in her backyard...

      ON A HOMELESS MAN

      He's below a banner reading: "HONEY FOR THE HOMELESS: HONEY
      DRIVE."  Chuck stands next to him holding a jar of honey.


      CAMERA ROCKETS through the headstones until FINDING a large
      mound of earth next to a hole in the ground next to a
      headstone that reads "Charles Charles, Loving Father." The
      TWO GRAVEYARD WORKERS seen earlier are about to take their
      first shovels-full of dirt and sling them into Chuck's grave. 
      Ned runs up to the Graveyard Workers, out of breath.

                                    NED
                Hey, I think somebody's truck's on fire.

      They look over his shoulder to see their work truck CONSUMED
      IN FLAMES.  The Workers GASP and run to put out the fire.

                                      GRAVEYARD WORKERS

      Ned makes sure they're not looking and jumps into the grave,
      pulling the lid off the coffin.  Chuck sits up and smiles at
      the sight of her Prince Charming.  He returns the gesture:

                It's just so shockingly stupid I have a
                hard time believing you did it.

                                    NED
                You just agreed to be her partner.

                                      EMERSON
                I intend to profit from your stupidity. 
                Are you in love with her?  Cause it's
                that level of stupid.

                                    NED
                I'll admit to being confused.  This is
                a very confusing time.  Childhood issues. 
                Diggin' in the dirt.S'all coming up.

                                      EMERSON
              We all have the childhood issues.  I
                got a full subscription.  Horror stories.

                                    NED
                I kinda killed her dad when I was 10.

                                      EMERSON
                Maybe not "horror" stories.

                                    NED
                She doesn't know.  I wanted to make it
                better or different from what it was
                because what it was was her dead and I
                didn't want that to be my fault, too.

                                      EMERSON
                Who died instead, Captain Sav'a'ho?

      Ned hands him the folded newspaper in his back pocket.

                                    NED
                It's a random proximity thing.

                                      EMERSON
                Bitch, I was in proximity.

                                    NED
                I wasn't thinking.

      Emerson glances at the obituaries and a circled picture of
      the now deceased obese, chain-smoking Funeral Director.                                                                                        38.

                                      EMERSON
                I wondered where he went.

                                    NED
                Thank god he was an A-hole.  He took
                stuff off of dead people and sold it on
                ebay.  It's all in the obituary.

                                      EMERSON
                Oh, that's nice.  Fact he was an A-hole
                make you feel better about what you did?

                                    NED
                Yes.  Immensely.  I would've felt
                horrible if it was... you, for example.

      Emerson slaps Ned upside the head.

                                    NED (CONT'D)
                Ow.  I'm not proud.

                                      EMERSON
                I like that you did it.  Makes the worst
                thing I ever did seem insignificant.

                                    NED
                Listen to you all judgey-judge.

                                      EMERSON
                You don't know this woman.  You don't
                know anything about her.  Except she
                got herself killed.

    As Ned takes that in...

                                      NARRATOR
                The Pie-Maker hadn't considered Chuck
                could be anything but the little girl
                next door he fell in love with.

      CAMERA DRIFTS OVER THE LEDGE to find the side of the Pie

                She only ever had charitable thoughts
                and her heart was filled with kindness.


      Emerson, Ned and Chuck pull up in front of the building. 
      Only Ned and Emerson get out.  Chuck slouches in the back.

                                      NARRATOR
                Boutique Travel travel boutique manager,
                  Diedre Duffield, hoped it would catch a
                killer before a killer caught her.


      Ned's VINTAGE MERCEDES screeches to a halt across the street
      from Chuck's Aunts' House.  Ned, Emerson and Chuck hop out.

                                    NED
                You stay here.

                                      CHUCK
                I just wanna look in the windows.  Like
                the ghost of Christmas past.

                                    NED
                This isn't your Christmas anymore.

                                      CHUCK
                I want my pie and I wanna eat it, too. 
                I'll get crumbs in the bed I don't mind.

                                    NED
                You can't.  You can have your pie, but
                you can't eat it.  That's how it works. 

                                      NARRATOR
                Chuck was the Pie-Maker's pie and he
                could never have a bite.

                                      EMERSON
                You're making me hungry.

                                      CHUCK
                What if something happened?  What if
                they got hoisted on my petard, too?  I
                would just die.  Again.

                                    NED
                I wish I could give you an emotional
                Heimlich so you could cough up that wad
              of fear and anxiety, but... I can't.

      Ned stares at her, his heart swells.

                                    NED (CONT'D)
                          (to Emerson)
                Give her a hug.

      Emerson gives Chuck a hug.

                                    NED (CONT'D)
                That was from me.

      Chuck watches them cross the street to her Aunts' house.                                                                                        45.

                For 19 years, 33 weeks, 3 days, 7 hours
                and 42 minutes, Aunt Vivian and Aunt
                Lily were all Chuck had.  And before
                Chuck, all they had were each other.


      Young Chuck and 30's Vivian and 40's Lily lead a RABBI and a
      train of PALLBEARERS carrying her father's coffin through
    the GRAVEYARD on the hill above the Synagogue.                                                                                        46.

                                      NARRATOR
                They retreated behind a fence and made
                sure the world stayed on the other side.


      Ned and Emerson stand at a walk-in gate talking to a box.

                                      VIVIAN'S VOICE
                Hello?

                                    NED
                Hi.  Uh, my name is Ned.  I lived next
                door 20 years ago.  I was a friend of
                Chuck's... or Charlotte's, rather.

      Emerson shoots him a look.BUZZZ.  The walk in gate unlatches
    and Ned turns and gives Chuck in the car a thumbs up.  She
      returns the thumbs up and then immediately scrambles out of
    the car, running to catch the gate before it closes. 


      Chuck peers through the window at her Aunts, examining the
      life she left behind.  Regardless of their neurosis, Chuck's
      Aunts were the only family she had and she loves them.

                                      NARRATOR
                For the life of her, Chuck couldn't
                remember why she was so desperate to
                leave her Aunts behind.


      Chuck spots Ned spotting her and ducks out of sight. 

      She sneaks another look at her Aunts through the window,
      surrounded by their feathered friends in cages.  She moves
      around the side of the house, eyes the stacks of bee hives.


      Chuck stands on the ledge out of sight, the two plaster
      monkeys under her arm.


      Chuck is trying to see through the window, but can't around
      the winding maze of NEWSPAPER STACKS.  She shimmies along
      the ledge toward another window.


      Chuck emerges from the second story and climbs down the rose
      trellis.  She turns back to see:

      SECOND STORY WINDOW

      Ned's looking out the window at Chuck.  The wail of
      approaching sirens can be heard in the distance.

      NED'S P.O.V.  - YARD

      Chuck runs across the yard and stops at the dead Plastic
      Sack Killer and kicks him.

                                      NARRATOR
                A rush of warmth washed over the Pie
                Maker, he would later describe this
                feeling as delight.  The girl he rescued
                from death had returned the favor.


      POLICE and NEWS VANS parked in the street outside the fence. 
      POLICE OFFICERS, REPORTERS and CAMERA-MEN storm through the
      gait and stop short at an unusual sight.

    THE DEAD PLASTIC SACK KILLER

      He's laying sprawled out surrounded by broken glass.                                                                                        52.

      They step out onto the porch, surveying the REPORTERS and a
      gathering CROWD OF LOOKILOOS

                had another go at the teat of stardom.

      ON CHUCK 

      She's wearing scarf and long-coat, watching from the gathering
      CROWD OF LOOKILOOS.

                                      CHUCK
                Hey.  Aren't those the world-renowned
                Darling Mermaid Darlings?

      The Reporters glance at Chuck, then back at Lily and Vivian,
      then swarm to the Darling Mermaid Darlings in a CACOPHONOUS
      MURMUR OF QUESTIONS and GASPS.

      Chuck smiles, pleased with herself...

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

      The flowers in the yard are blooming and there's a fresh
      coat of paint being applied to the house.  Lily and Vivian
      emerge and walk down the path to the gate, stepping out.

      Vivian and Lily in robes and wearing bathing caps climb the
