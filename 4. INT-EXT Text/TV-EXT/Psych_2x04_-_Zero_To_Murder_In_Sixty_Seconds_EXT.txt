      CLOSE ON the rear wheel of a ten-speed bicycle.  There are 
      multiple baseball cards attached to the spokes, a pedal-
      powered generator attached to a taillight, and no fewer than 
    ten reflectors.  The handlebars are adorned with side mirrors 
    and a mini-speedometer.  The middle bar has an air pump and 
      water bottle.  We pan up to reveal YOUNG SHAWN clipping his 
      Sony Walkman to the bike.  

    He puts on the headphones as we pull back to reveal YOUNG GUS 
    -- in helmet, knee pads and elbow pads -- waiting patiently 
      beside him on his no-name banana-seat bike.  Gus' only 
      accessory is the thumb-bell attached to the U-frame 
      handlebars.  Far down the street, HENRY stands with his arms 
      raised.  

    He lowers his hands and Shawn takes off.  We stay on him as 
    he pedals furiously, "Eye of the Tiger"blaring in his 
      headphones.  His baseball cards are clacking, lights 
      blinking, and reflectors... reflecting.  He grabs his water 
      bottle like a marathon runner and douses his head as he flies 
      across the finish line.  He then looks up to see Gus 
      patiently standing next to Henry, having crossed the finish 
      line ages ago.  Shawn is dumbfounded.  

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    How d I lose?  My bike is twice as 
                    good as his!  

                                  HENRY
                    That s the thing, Shawn.  Sure your bike 
                    looks good, with the cool reflectors and 
                    gadgets from a year s worth of cereal-
                    top boxes, but Gus here focused on what 
                    counts.  Hard work.  He just out pedaled 
                    you, son.  You understand?

      Shawn looks at Henry and then at Gus.  Gus rings his thumb 
      bell -- challenging Shawn.  

                                  YOUNG SHAWN
                    Best two out of three!  I had the 
                    wrong song playing that time.

      They reposition themselves as Henry just shakes his head...  


      Shawn and Gus follow Lassiter outside.

                                  SHAWN
                    Maybe I should be giving a 
                      presentation, too.  On 21st Century

                    sonic weaponry -- you name it.  

      Lassiter then stops dead in his tracks and stares at an empty 
      space on the curb where his car used to be.

                                        ACT ONE


      Lassiter tries not to let any of the passing officers know 
    his car was stolen.

                                  LASSITER
                          (to Shawn and Gus)
                    Keep your mouths shut.  I don t 
                    want people to think anything s 
                    wrong.
                          (then; to passing 
                            officers)
                    Morning O Connel, James, Dobson.  
                    Just shooting the breeze...  
                    Rapping with the fellas.

                                  SHAWN
                    Good.  Now they ll just think it s 
                    1974.

                                  LASSITER
                          (realizes)
                    Wait.  Is this some kind of a 
                    prank?  Did youtake my car?  

      Shawn and Gus are taken aback.  Shawn pours it on.

                                  SHAWN
                    For you to think that we d stoop so 
                    low as to tamper with police-issued 
                    property and defile the institution 
                    that is the Santa Barbara Police 
                    Department is an affront to our 
                    honor.  I, for one, am offended.

                                  GUS
                    And I, for two.

    Gus then surreptitiously turns to Shawn.

                                  GUS (CONT D)
                          (mouths)
                    Did you?

      Shawn shakes his head,  no.   

                                  LASSITER
                    Maybe they left some evidence...

      Lassiter stoops down and looks at the empty space.  SHAWN 
      VISION - CLOSE UP on Lassiter s keychain, he sees the tiny 
      remnant of a valet parking stub.  

                                  SHAWN
                    I m getting something...

    His leg starts to  uncontrollably  shake.  

                                  GUS
                    What, Shawn?  What is it?

                                  SHAWN
                    It s a psychic trace on Lassiter s 
                    car...

      Lassiter tries to ignore them, but his interest is piqued.  
    He looks up out the corner of his eye.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    It, it s faint.  I hear the car.

                          (rolls eyes)
                    If you don t mind...

    He goes back to looking for evidence.

                                  SHAWN
                    Wait!  There s more...  
                          (closes his eyes)
                    You were recently someplace where 
                    the security of your car was 
                      compromised...  Am I seeing 
                    someplace posh?  Someplace 
                    surprisingly upscale for someone on 
                    a civil servant s salary?

                          (intrigued)
                    Okay, I ll humor you.  As it just 
                    so happens, I dined at a very 
                    exclusive restaurant last night.

                                  LASSITER
                    It is none of your business with 
                    whom I spend my personal time.

                    He was alone.

                          (again; eyes closed)
                    Something happened at the 
                    restaurant that led to your car 
                    being stolen.  I m sensing red

                    No... The valets!  Check the valet 
                    who parked your car.  They may have 
                    used the old  key in the putty  
                    trick to get an impression.

                                  LASSITER
                    Of course that would ve been my 
                    first deduction, had I not been 
                    smarting from this egregious 
                    offense.  I ll get right over--

    He remembers his predicament.

                                  SHAWN
                    No car.  Remember?

    He and Gus share a laugh.

                                  GUS
                    Maybe there s a bus stop near this 
                    fancy restaurant.

                                  SHAWN
                    Or a cab.

                                  GUS

      Busted, they lead Lassiter to Gus  parked car.  Gus opens the 
      driver s side and starts to get in.

      They sheepishly get in the back seat.  Lassiter gets behind 
    the wheel and pushes the driver s seat all the way back, 
      squeezing Shawn s legs to his chest.

      Lassiter pulls off and we:


      Shawn is on his cell phone.  We see a warehouse in the 
      background.

                          (into phone)
                    Gus, get this.  The valet s phone 
                    number was actually the number to a 
                    pay phone outside of a warehouse...  
                    Yep... Meet me at the station in an 
                    hour. 

    He hangs up.


    The bust is in progress.  Various police officers and crime 
      scene workers mill about, collecting evidence and leading 
      handcuffed members of the theft ring out of the building.  
      Inside, we see that the floor is covered with cars, car parts 
    and machinery used to turn the former into the latter.  Shawn 
    and Gus watch as WALLY (we ll meet him later) is led out.  
      SHAWN VISION - Wally appears to smile as he s pushed into the 
      back of a patrol car.  Chief Vick approaches, holding an 
      evidence folder.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Looks like a slam dunk, Spencer.  Wally 
                    there is the ring leader.  All the 
                    evidence we ll need to take him down is 
                    right here.  Stolen parts, serial 
                    numbers, shipment logs, you name it.

                    Well, if I can t thank you, I can t

    She hands Shawn a check.

                    This ring was responsible for

                          (re: evidence folder)
                    Wally had operatives in place as valets, 
                    mechanics and car wash attendants -- all 
                    copying people s keys and then stealing 
                    their cars from different locations.

                    Does it say anything in there about 
                    them stealing loose change or 
                    switching the presets on radios?  
                    Because that always happens to me.

                    Gus, put your aluminum foil hat 
                    back on.

                                  GUS
                    I m notparanoid.  It happens.

                                  INTERIM CHIEF VICK
                    Anyway, I believe this is a department 
                    record for the fastest bust ever for a case 
                    this size.  Truly your best work.

    All of the officers applaud Shawn for his work.  He nods, 
      basking in their praise.  Lassiter, also clapping, lingers 
      after the others disperse.  He pulls Shawn and Gus aside.

                                  LASSITER
                    I can t help but notice a car 
                    belonging to a certain head detective 
                    isn t in here.

                                  SHAWN
                    Don t worry, we had the boys from 
                    crime scene move it down the street 
                    right before you and the chief 
                    arrived.  You re in the clear.

      Lassiter breathes a sigh of relief.  Shawn turns to Gus.  

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                          (realizes)
                    Today is street sweeping.  Did we 
                    park on the east side of the street 
                    or the west?

                                  GUS
                    The north side.

                                  SHAWN
                    Dude, it wasn t the north side.

                                  GUS
                    Sure it was.  I d know -- I m good 
                    with directions.  You re not.

                                  SHAWN
                    Please, I m great with directions.  
                    You have the bearings of a bumble 
                    bee.

      Behind Lassiter, Shawn and Gus then see a tow truck pulling 
      away with Lassiter s car -- the parking ticket still in the 
      windshield.  They exchange a look.

                                  SHAWN (CONT D)
                    Was that tow truck going east or 
                    west?

                    I don t care.  Let s go!

      They bolt before Lassiter realizes what happened.


      A semi-truck holding the fleet of cars from Jonny G. s shop 
    is parked in an abandoned field.  Two men in dark suits and 
      sunglasses stand outside of a limo and hand a briefcase to 
      Wally.  He opens it to reveal multiple stacks of one hundred 
      dollar bills.

                                  WALLY
                    It s been a pleasure doing business 
                    with you.

    He closes the briefcase and they shake hands.  In the 
      distance, they hear the sound of booming bass musicfollowed 
    by the wailof police sirens.  Gus and Shawn, with Lassiter 
    and Juliet stuffed in the back seat, pull up followed by 
      squad cars.  The police encircle Wally and the men, sirens 
      blaring.  The cops then leap from their vehicles, guns drawn.  
      Lassiter and Juliet get out of the Echo, followed by Shawn 
    and Gus.

                                  LASSITER
                    Hold it right there.  You re all 
                    under arrest!

                                  WALLY
                    We re simply making a transaction.  
                    I m like,  Here are your automotive 
                    goods, sir.  And he s like,  Please 
                    take my money.   Capitalism.

      Shawn approaches.

                    Selling custom cars is legal.  But 
                    murdering Jonny G. to take over his

                                  SHAWN
                    No, it makes perfect sense.  
                    Especially knowing how you resented 
                    Jonny G. for not including you in 
                    the real business of the shop...

                    Jonny G. was involved in a lot of 
                    stuff I didn t know about.  If I 
                    asked questions, he d be like

                    So you came up with a plan to get 
                    Jonny out of the way and take over 
                    his operations.  You got yourself 
                    arrested, knowing that in jail 
                    you d have the perfect alibi when 
                    Jonny showed up dead.

                    You brilliantly planned his murder

                    I always do the final check myself, 
                    you know, to make sure it meets the

                                  SHAWN
                    You knew he always tested the cars 
                    on the day they were scheduled for 
                    delivery.  So you figured out which

                    using.  Then you rigged it to leak

                    Very creative.  But unlike last 
                    time, there s no evidence.  The
                    People s Burden.

      Shawn then has a psychic inspiration.

                          (hand to head)
                    Wait, someone s talking.

      Everyone looks around.  No one is speaking.

                    Someone who witnessed everything...

    He stumbles around until he places his hand on one of the 
      cars.

                    Check inside the wheels of the 
                    cars.

      Wally jumps in front of the officer.

                                  WALLY
                    Stop!  You don t have a warrant.

                    Carry on.

    An officer takes a crow bar and pries the cover off of one of 
    the wheels.  Plastic bags of white powder fall out.

                    It s drugs, sir.  In all of them.

                    Okay, you re coming with us.  This 
                    time, for drug trafficking and

    He cuffs Wally as officers grab the other two men.
