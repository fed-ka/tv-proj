  FADE IN:


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Practice swords clash as the men train under the ever 
  watchful eye of DOCTORE. AGRON presses his younger brother 
  DURO, hammering him. Duro takes a crack across the angry 
  BRAND on his forearm. He GRUNTS in pain, dropping his sword.

                                        DURO
                        Fuck. Two weeks and the mark is 
                        still raw as a whore s cunt.

                                        AGRON
                        I bear the same, brother. Without 
                        pissing about it.

  Agron kicks the fallen sword over to him.

                                        DURO
                        That s because you have the hide of 
                        a goat. And almost as much sense.

  Duro attacks. Agron meets him, half taunting him with a 
  laugh shared only by siblings attempting to brain each 
  other. As they battle past CAMERA, ADJUST to find

  SPARTACUS AND VARRO

  sparring. Spartacus is a thing of physical perfection, his 
  two practice swords slicing the air with balletic 
    malevolence. Varro counters, brandishing sword and shield, 
  looking for an opening. He finds one and charges, but

  SPARTACUS EASILY DEFLECTS

  with one sword, SMACKING Varro across the midsection with 
  the other. Varro grunts, shaking it off. Spartacus circles 
  him.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You lower your guard after each 
                        assault.

                                        VARRO
                        I shall see it raised then...

  Varro rushes, raining blows at Spartacus. Spartacus 
  counters, each stroke sure and swift. Varro thrusts his 
  shield out to defend. Spartacus quickly rolls off it, using 
  his momentum to spin behind Varro and bring his sword up 
  around his throat. He growls in his ear.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Your head is mine. How shall I 
                        mount it?

  Varro chuckles in defeat as he pushes the sword away.

                                        VARRO
                        You move well today.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You do not. What distracts you?

  Varro s mood deflates.

                                        VARRO
                        I had Ashur send letter to Aurelia. 
                        More than a week past now, and no 
                        reply.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You expect different? A woman 
                        seldom rushes back to the husband 
                        who calls her whore.

                                        VARRO
                        I said no such thing.
                                (off Spartacus  
                                  look)
                        Not in words.
                                  quickly)(
                        The letter was contrite. I admitted 
                        I reacted poorly to the news of her 
                        being with child.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And now she makes you wait. The way 
                        women punish us for being fools.

  Spartacus gears up for another round.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Strike it from your mind. Or find 
                        your brains upon the sand...

  Spartacus attacks, hammering Varro. They battle like fucking 
  gods, WIPING US TO --


  INT. TRICLINIUM/VILLA - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  POV - MOVING past a line of SIX BEAUTIFUL NAKED SLAVE GIRLS, 
  each wearing an exquisite WHITE MASK in the classic 
  likenesses of Roman Goddesses.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                                          LICINIA (O.S.)
                        These are exquisite...

  REVERSE TO REVEAL LICINIA (the Ilithyia-esque beauty from 
  ep. 108). LUCRETIA stands with her, a warm smile bending her 
  lips. NAEVIA hovers in the background.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        They have been in the family for 
                        generations.

                                          LICINIA
                      So this sort of arrangement happens 
                        often?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        No. But when such requests are 
                        made, one must be prepared to offer 
                        only the finest quality.

                                          LICINIA
                        The House of Batiatus does not fall 
                        short in that regard.

  She smiles wryly, not speaking of the masks at all. Her eyes 
  fall on one of them, striking her fancy.

                                          LICINIA(cont'd)
                        This one, I think.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Diana, Goddess of the Hunt. A fine 
                        choice.

  She removes the DIANA MASK, revealing MIRA, a voluptuous, 
  sultry house slave in her mid 20 s. Lucretia hands the mask 
  to Licinia. She considers it as she moves through the villa, 
  heading out.

                                          LICINIA
                      Do you think she would approve? 
                        When Actaeon saw her bathing, she 
                        turned the poor bastard into a stag 
                        and set her dogs upon him.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        How fitting then, that you shall 
                        have a stag of your own to play 
                        with. Have you decided?





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

                                          LICINIA
                        There is only one man I would 
                        invite such peril to know. I will 
                        have Spartacus.

  Lucretia forces a smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The champion, of course.

                                          LICINIA
                      Is that a problem? If more coin is 
                        required --

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  instantly regroups)(
                        No, I would not hear of it. The 
                        cousin of Marcus Crassus deserves 
                      no less than the Slayer of 
                        Theokoles, at fair price.

  Licinia pauses.

                                          LICINIA
                      It is not the price that gives 
                        concern. If ever my husband were to 
                        hear of this...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The gods themselves would have to 
                        whisper it in his ear. We take the 
                        utmost care regarding the delicate 
                        nature of these arrangements. The 
                        mask will ensure anonymity, but you 
                        must also do your part. Tell no 
                        one. And arrive exactly at the 
                        appointed time, unencumbered.

                                          LICINIA
                        Absent slaves or attendants?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Who may hold your husband s loyalty 
                        truer to value. I would avoid 
                          complications, for you and this 
                        ludus.

  ILITHYIA enters with her Slaves, escorted by Batiatus  house 
  Guards. Licinia quickly hides the mask behind her back.

                        What was his name? The Celt...

                        Yes, Segovax. Pity. Perhaps you 
                        should buy several next time. Until 
                        you get the hang of it.

  Ilithyia forces a smile. Lucretia intervenes.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It is a difficult process. Very few 
                        live to see the test, fewer still 
                        the arena. My husband demands only 
                        the best.

                      my own husband expects me.

  She kisses Lucretia on the cheek.

  Licinia exits, giving Ilithyia a measured smile as she 
  passes. Ilithyia eyes her as she disappears down the hall.

                      It warms the heart, to know my 
                        hands are responsible.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Let me take them in thanks.

  Lucretia takes her hands, moving to kiss her cheek. Ilithyia 
  adjusts, kissing Lucretia on the lips.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        You should be more careful.

  Lucretia eyes her, not sure of her meaning. Ilithyia laughs.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        With Licinia. She is of a strata 
                        above your station, and will not 
                        hesitate to remind you of it if her 
                        mood shifts. And it shifts 
                        frequently.

  Lucretia smiles, giving nothing away.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I am well versed in dealing with

                      Of course you are.

  She hooks her arm in Lucretia s, strolling through the 
  villa.

                        Invited? To what?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The masquerade.

  Lucretia tenses, tries to cover.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                      Oh come, you think I had not 
                        noticed the mask she was attempting 
                      to conceal? Am I to be excluded, 
                        then?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You are mistaken. There is no 
                        masquerade. She merely borrows the 
                        visage of Diana.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      To avoid  complications ?

  Lucretia tenses. Ilithyia clocks the reaction with a grin.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        A wealthy woman of status visiting 
                        a ludus... Concealing masks and 
                        whispering of complications... If I 
                        did not know better, I would 
                        suspect intent to fuck one of your 
                        gladiators.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Ilithyia --

  Ilithyia squeals in delight.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        She is, isn t she? That little 
                        whore! How positively depraved!

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  panicked)(
                        I promised discretion. You must not 
                        breathe a word of this.

  Ilithyia takes Lucretia s arm again, her eyes twinkling.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I would never think it. You have 
                        been a most valued friend. And this 
                        will be our little secret...

  Ilithyia smiles warmly. Lucretia forces one of her own, 
  knowing that Ilithyia now has the advantage over her. The 
  only question is how she will use it...                                                                                    8.


  INT. BEDCHAMBER/BATH - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  BATIATUS has just come from the bath. SLAVES dry, perfume, 
  and dress him. He frowns sourly, not caring for the news 
  Lucretia brings.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I can control her.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Ilithyia?
                                  snorts)(
                        Like you did with her and Segovax? 
                        She had her own man make attempt on 
                        Spartacus, under our very roof. And 
                        you yet speak of control.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Spartacus inflames her beyond 
                        reason. Licinia is another matter. 
                        Even Ilithyia has sense enough to 
                        fear reprisal from the cousin of 
                        Marcus Crassus.

                                        BATIATUS
                      As she should. Jupiter s cock, the 
                        man shits gold! The favor of such 
                      an ally in Rome could pave my way 
                      to a seat in the senate...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        There is one small obstacle. 
                        Licinia desires the touch of our 
                        champion.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus? He will not be 
                        difficult.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He is always difficult.

                                        BATIATUS
                      In a past that no longer exists. I 
                        shall command... and it shall be 
                        done.

  He pulls her into a heated kiss, confident and in charge.                                                                                    9.


  INT. TROPHY ROOM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Two GUARDS escort Spartacus in. Batiatus meets him, waves 
  the Guards back.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The Champion of Capua arrives! A 
                        man who so terrifies Jupiter the 
                        clouds burst and the heavens weep!

                                          SPARTACUS
                      My glory is but a reflection of my 
                        dominus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You flatter!

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I return in kind.

  Batiatus laughs, enjoying that.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And the gods take notice. Just when 
                        I thought we had accrued every 
                        accolade possible, yet another 
                        falls to us from the heavens. Fair 
                        Licinia, cousin of Marcus Crassus 
                        himself, has personally requested 
                        you.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Crassus?

                                        BATIATUS
                        The richest man in all the 
                        Republic.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        A great honor. Who will be my 
                        opponent?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Opponent?!
                                  laughs, delighted)(
                        Licinia has no interest in watching 
                        you fight. Her desires are of a 
                        more... intimate nature.

  Spartacus takes that in with a troubled frown.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I am to lie with her?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        And shame all men who follow.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  a beat)(
                        Such things are asked of a 
                        champion?

  Batiatus senses resistance.

                                        BATIATUS
                        They are.
                                  a beat)(
                        You have concern?

  A beat. Then Spartacus locks eyes with Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I am the champion of Capua. I shall 
                        perform all duties required of me.

  Batiatus beams, pleased at the response.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Bring her to satisfaction. And see 
                        our fortunes rise along with your 
                        cock.

  Batiatus moves off, WIPING US TO --


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  TIGHT ON STITCHES being removed from a freshly healed wound.

                                          MEDICUS (O.S.)
                      Is there discomfort?

  WIDEN TO REVEAL CRIXUS sitting on a table, being tended by 
  the MEDICUS. There is obvious discomfort, but Crixus refuses 
  to let it show.

                                        CRIXUS
                        None.

  Medicus snorts, not believing it.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        How long before I return to 
                        training?

                        The fact that you yet walk among 
                        the living is marvel in itself. To 
                        press the blessing --

                        How long?

  The Medicus considers the question with a frown.

                                          MEDICUS
                        A week. Perhaps two --

                                        CRIXUS
                        Tomorrow.

                                          MEDICUS
                        No. It is much too soon.

  Crixus stands, looming over the Medicus.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Tomorrow.

  The Medicus gauges the situation, nods.

                                          MEDICUS
                        Tomorrow, then.

                                        ASHUR
                        A glorious day, too long in coming!

  They look over to find ASHUR hobbling in.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Crixus! Risen from the dead! And 
                        Ashur, finally freed of his 
                        shackles, to take up sword again!

  Crixus glances at Ashur s leg brace.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You would resume training? As a 
                        gladiator?

                                        ASHUR
                        I yet bear the mark.

  Ashur holds out his forearm, showing the brand of Batiatus: 
  the Mark of the Brotherhood.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    12.

                        arena.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Perhaps this time you will have 
                        sense to stay out of my way.

  Crixus exits. Ashur glares after him, all trace of 
    pleasantries replaced by thoughts of vengeance.

                                        ASHUR

  The Medicus moves to comply. OFF Ashur, burning with 
  hatred...


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON LUCRETIA, lips slightly parted in absent pleasure.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He gave you no pause?

  WIDEN TO REVEAL Batiatus ramming a SLAVE GIRL from behind as 
  she goes down on Lucretia. Naevia is absent.

                                        BATIATUS
                        None. Our dog... is finally

                        You were wise... to put down his 
                        bitch...

  They climax together. Batiatus withdraws with a laugh, 
  pushing the Slave Girl aside.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Bring us wine.

  The Slave Girl exits. Batiatus nestles Lucretia, his lips 
  finding hers.

                        Everything comes to plan. We shall

                        with it the ear of Marcus Crassus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Every breath he takes is in service 
                      to the glory of this house.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I know he is willing. But it has 
                        been many months since he last lay 
                        with a woman. After such a time, 
                        his passion may be... all too 
                        brief.

  Batiatus considers that with a frown as the Slave Girl and 
  Mira enter with the wine, pour.

                                        BATIATUS
                        That would prove unfortunate.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Yet easily avoided, if Spartacus 
                        were to be presented opportunity to 
                        hone his skills beforehand...

  OFF Lucretia as she sips her wine, a salacious smile bending 
  her lips...

  INT. SPARTACUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus enters his cell and freezes, tensing.  REVEAL 
  Mira, lounging naked on his bed, eyes smoldering, a sultry 
  smile on her lips.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You have wandered to the wrong 
                        cell.

                        Are you not Spartacus? Bringer of 
                        Rain? I am Mira. I have been sent 
                      to please you.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      To what end?

                        itself?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I do not care for games. Give your 
                        true purpose.

  She hesitates. He yanks her up.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Find your tongue!

                        Domina fears it has been too long 
                        since you were last with a woman. 
                        That you will be unable to withhold 
                        your seed long enough to please the 
                        Roman woman.

  A beat. Spartacus releases her. His manner softens -- but 
  not his words.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The notion offends me. As does your 
                        presence.

  He picks her garment up off the bed, shoves it into her 
  hands. She stares at him, surprised.

                                        MIRA
                        You do not desire me?

  Spartacus removes his towel and climbs into bed, turning 
  away from her.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I desire only sleep. And the 
                        absence of dreams.

  He closes his eyes. She stands for a moment, uncertain, then 
  exits, WIPING US TO --


  INT. MESS HALL/PANTRY - BATIATUS  LUDUS/VILLA - NIGHT

  HECTOR, a handsome, rugged guard, unlocks the pantry gate 
  for a now-dressed Mira. She disappears up the stairs to the 
  villa as he locks the gate and moves off on his rounds. A 
  beat. ADJUST to find

  CONTINUED:

  NAEVIA

  emerging from the shadows of the pantry, having narrowly 
  escaped detection. She presses against the gate, her eyes 
  desperately searching for

  CRIXUS,

  who appears from the shadows of the mess hall. He quickly 
  steps up to the gate and kisses her passionately through the 
  bars. Crixus grips the iron bars, hissing his frustration.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The gods grant me strength to tear 
                        these bars from their fucking 
                        moorings.

                                        NAEVIA
                      We were fools to think they would 
                        favor us.

                                        CRIXUS
                      We yet share a roof. It would not 
                      be so had Dominus sold me to 
                        Vibius. Is that not some proof that 
                        our union is favored?

                                        NAEVIA
                      To have you, but not have you. It 
                      is a wound beyond healing.

  Crixus gently caresses her cheek.

                                        CRIXUS
                        All wounds heal. Even the deepest.

  She takes his hand, tears coursing down her face.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Would that they had never been 
                        inflicted.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You would wish never to have known 
                      my heart?

  SOUNDS from the villa above draw her attention. She kisses 
  him quickly without answering, hurries up the stairs. OFF 
  CRIXUS, left uncertain by the exchange...                                                                                    16.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  SWORDS CLASH as the day s training begins. Spartacus and 
  Varro exchange blows. Varro pauses, catching sight of

  CRIXUS

  as he strides out into the square, looking like he owns the 
  fucking place. The other men pause to watch his triumphant 
  return.

                                        VARRO
                        The Undefeated Gaul returns.

  Spartacus gives Crixus a dismissive glance.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Perhaps it is time he chose a new 
                        name.

  ANGLE ON DOCTORE as he clasps arms with Crixus.

                                          DOCTORE
                      My spirit soars to see you again 
                        upon the sands.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  a vulpine grin)(
                        The underworld would not have me.

  Doctore turns to the men.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Take note, you worthless fucks! A 
                        true champion rejoins the 
                        Brotherhood!

  He tosses Spartacus a pointed look as half the men hustle 
  over to welcome Crixus back. Agron spits in disgust, 
  snorting to Duro.

                                        AGRON
                        Champion of ass and balls.

  ADJUST off Crixus and the men to

  THE BALCONY

  where Lucretia watches with an appreciative smile. Naevia 
  hovers nearby.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                        Has there ever been such a man as 
                        Crixus?

                                        NAEVIA
                        No, Domina. There has not.

  Her eyes fill with longing and regret, unnoticed by Lucretia 
  as Batiatus joins them from the triclinium.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Praise the gods for his return.

                        And our purse filled by such.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Yes. Filled to bursting.

  Lucretia smiles, but as she turns back to Crixus it is clear 
  that her interest has nothing to do with monetary gain. 
  TRAINING SQUARE

  Crixus slides his arm into a practice shield and takes a 
  wooden sword offered by Doctore. He grips it with deep 
    satisfaction.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You will spar with Duro --

                        The German? He has yet to step in 
                        the arena.

                                          DOCTORE
                        And you have been long absent. 
                        Prove yourself with the man and see 
                        advancement.

                        And who shall face Ashur?

  They turn to find Ashur striding up with a practice sword, 
  leg brace removed but a slight limp still in evidence.

                                        ASHUR
                        Choose carefully, for I long for 
                        blood.

  Doctore glances at Ashur s leg, locks eyes with a frown.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

  Ashur glances up to the balcony. Batiatus motions him up to 
  the villa.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A word.

  Batiatus disappears back inside. Ashur s proud smile wilts. 
  Crixus laughs.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The master calls his dog to his

  A knot of Gladiators laugh as Crixus moves to spar with 
  Duro.

                        lowest among us would have ended

                      He is eager to regain his place. I 
                        would not see him overreach, nor 
                        hide pain from his recovery. If you 
                        notice Crixus attempting to conceal 
                        anything from me, tell me 
                        immediately.

  Naevia averts her eyes, the dangerous irony of that not lost 
  on her.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Yes, Domina.

  Mira enters with a fresh urn of hot milk.  She pours it into 
  the tub, nervously avoiding eye-contact with Lucretia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The opposite sex has no sense when 
                      it comes to their limits.  They 
                        must be constantly watched, least 
                        they harm themselves in the simple 
                        act of being men.

  Mira turns to leave.

  Mira turns back, her eyes downcast in respect -- and fear.

                        How did Spartacus fare last night?  
                        Was his cock of impressive size 
                        when engorged?  How many times did 
                      he have you?  Speak.

  Mira shifts nervously.

  Lucretia levels a withering gaze.  A beat.

  Mira complies, eyes never rising to meet Lucretia s.  Naevia 
  subtly averts her own, not wishing to add to the girl s 
    embarrassment as Lucretia assesses her body.

                        Apologies, Domina.

  Lucretia considers her for a long beat, returns her 
  attention to her bath.

                        will find a sword in its place.

  Lucretia waves her away.  OFF Mira, fear constricting her 
  face as she exits, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The Gladiators spar and work various training stations.  
  Crixus, intent on proving that he s in full form, viciously 
  presses Duro.  Duro gets cracked, stumbles back, fighting to 
  catch his breath.

                                        DURO
                        This isn t... the arena...

                        The world is my arena, pup.

  Crixus charges, his sword a blur.  Duro struggling to 
  deflect them, fails.  Crixus sends him crashing to the sand, 
  dazed and spitting blood.  Crixus laughs, turning to 
  Doctore.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    22.

  WHAM!  Agron slams into Crixus, knocking him off his feet.  
  The two men struggle, throwing punches.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Stand down!  Agron!

  He grabs Agron by the hair, hurls him off Crixus.  Duro 
  rushes to help him.  Crixus leaps to his feet.  Doctore 
  restrains him with a palm to his chest.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Enough.

                        and I will see you both to the 
                        mines!

  Duro and Agron move off, glaring at Crixus as they pass 
  Spartacus and Varro drinking from the rain barrel.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Crixus continues making friends.

  Varro nods absently, lost in thought as he drinks.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Yet no word from your wife?

                        more coin to pay Ashur for the 
                        service of letters.

  Spartacus follows Varro s gaze, sees Ashur at the ludus gate 
  with Batiatus, preparing to leave.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You will dishonor us, if your mind 
                      is not on the games.  Tell the

  Spartacus turns to find Crixus coming up, practice sword and 
  shield in hand.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Perhaps you would care for a real 
                        opponent.

  Spartacus considers him for a moment.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Are you so eager to return to the 
                        Medicus?

  Crixus  hand tightens round the handle of his sword.  But 
  before he can respond Hector the guard interrupts.

                                        HECTOR
                        Crixus.  You are summoned.

  Crixus glares at Spartacus.

                        Soon.

  He turns and follows Hector, WIPING US TO --


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Crixus slams Lucretia, his eyes still smoldering from his 
  exchange with Spartacus.  She grips his hair, pulling him 
  into an animal kiss as they climax together.  Crixus slides 
  off of her, preparing to go.  Lucretia stops him.

                        Tarry a moment.

  Crixus registers surprise at the unusual request.

                        Dominus is yet at the marketplace.  
                        And Ilithyia is not expected for 
                        several hours.

  Crixus nods, settling back in next to her, unsure of what to 
  make of this.  She takes his hand, moves it gently across 
  her stomach.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

                        chest, threatening to never beat 
                        again.  And then you looked up to 
                        the pulvinus.  To me.   What was of 
                        your mind, in that frozen moment 
                        between life and death?

  Crixus considers the question, the memory yet fresh.

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

  blow.  Crixus looks up to the pulvinus.

  CRIXUS  POV

  scanning the crowd.  PAUSE BRIEFLY ON Lucretia, gazing at 
  us, distraught, then MOVE UP AND LAND ON NAEVIA.

  BACK TO CRIXUS

  as a faint smile bends his lips at the sight of her, the 
  reason for his own heart to beat.                                                                                    25.

  Crixus is still in the moment, speaking of the absent 
  Naevia.

                        having lived to know the love of a 
                        goddess.

  Lucretia is deeply moved, believing the words meant for her.

  Batiatus exits through the crowd, away from Solonius.  Ashur 
  watches him go, his loyal eyes filling with resentment as he 
  considers his options.

  disgust.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Five sacks, for the price of ten.  
                        And see to it they are dry this 
                        time, shit whore.  The last ones 
                        stank of mold.

                      Do not churn, good Solonius.

  Solonius turns to find Ashur approaching.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        The thief will suffer when prices 
                        plummet with the next harvest.

                        I pray his cock follows the 
                        decline.
                                  looks for Batiatus)(
                        You are left off leash?

                                        ASHUR
                      My master is for his villa.  I yet

                                  a whisper)(
                        And words, searching for receptive 
                        ears.

  Solonius gauges that, nods as he moves away from the 
  Merchant.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Such base character seldom weighs 
                        the true worth of a man.

                        offered when last we spoke.

                      It concerns your life.  If that is 
                      no cause to loosen your purse...

  Ashur starts to turn away.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Wait.

  Solonius withdraws his purse, slips Ashur a few coins.  
  Ashur stares at him.  Solonius sighs, hands him the entire 
  purse.

  Ashur slips away into the crowd.  OFF Solonius, darkening...


  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - SUNSET

  Lucretia walks with Ilithyia, who takes in the now opulent 
  villa with appreciation.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I really cannot believe the 
                        difference.  When I first entered 
                        your home, I felt great sorrow for 
                        the woman forced to live in such 
                        conditions.  Now look at you.  
                        Surrounded by opulence rivaling 
                        families of proper heritage.

  Lucretia smiles warmly through the veiled slight.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Trinkets, not nearly valued as much 
                      as your friendship.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        You have many new friends of late.  
                        You and Licinia seem quite at ease 
                        with one another.

  Lucretia tenses, wishing to avoid the subject.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gratitude for the introduction.  
                        Would you care for some wine or --

  Ilithyia sighs, flustered.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Wine will not still my thoughts.  I 
                        prattle on with pleasantries, but I 
                        cannot pretend indifference to what 
                        you revealed about Licinia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I revealed nothing.  You leapt to 
                        conclusions.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        And landed on proper footing.  Ever 
                        since, I can think of nothing else.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.
  CONTINUED:

                                        LUCRETIA
                        With respect, Licinia s passions 
                        are her own concern.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                  laughs)(
                      My mind falls not to Licinia.  It 
                      is filled with baser thoughts.  A 
                        vision of brutish hands being laid 
                        upon me... in a manner quite 
                        lacking in my husband s touch.
                                  breaking from it)(
                        I should not speak of such things.  
                        I dishonor myself.

  Lucretia considers this as a welcome surprise.  The fly has 
  at last wandered into the web.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Your desires should not shame you.  
                        You are a woman.  And our needs are 
                        vast.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I must put my mind from it.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      To the purpose of distraction?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Preferred to discovery.  Such a 
                        thing would ruin my husband, and 
                        taint my father s name.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Such concerns have been voiced by 
                        all those who have partaken of our 
                        wares.  Can you name any, save 
                        Licinia?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I have heard of none.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        No.  You have not.

  Lucretia smiles wryly, her point having been made.  Ilithyia 
  beams at the thought of getting away with such a thing.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Shall I make arrangement?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

  Ilithyia teeters on the edge of impropriety, finally pitches 
  over with a scandalous giggle.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Yes!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You will not be disappointed.  May 
                        I suggest Varro?  You seemed quite 
                        taken by the prowess he displayed 
                        the eve of the Vulcanalia.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Varro?  Far too common.  The man 
                        must equal the risk.

  She locks eyes with Lucretia, a knowing smile creasing her 
  lips.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        A fact well known by your own 
                        desires. Ones that I admittedly 
                        share...

  OFF LUCRETIA, realizing she has been maneuvered...

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  AN ORNATE VASE SMASHES against a wall.  WIDEN to reveal 
  Lucretia destroying the bedroom in a full-on Citizen Kane 
  rage.  Naevia and other SLAVES scamper out of the way.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Domina --

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Out!  Out of my fucking sight!

  She sweeps her perfume and oils from her vanity, the vessels 
  CRASHING to the floor.  Naevia and the Slaves comply, 
  passing Batiatus as he hurries in.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My ears suggest a tempest, but eyes 
                        reveal a wife gone fucking mad!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Look to that bitch Ilithyia as the 
                        cause.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.
  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus scowls, picking up the shattered pieces of the 
  ornate vase.

                                        BATIATUS
                        What new slights have prompted you 
                      to such costly eruption?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Her cunt overflows at the thought 
                      of Licinia bedding a gladiator.  
                        She desires equal treatment, and 
                        has set her lust upon Crixus!

  Batiatus considers that for a moment.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And her choice drove you to rage?

  Lucretia realizes she s slipped, quickly recovers.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It was not her choice, but her 
                        manner that offended.  Honey drips 
                        from her tongue, concealing the 
                        bite of piss she showers upon us.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The acrid taste is well familiar...

  He strokes her hair, trying to calm her.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        ... but we must swallow it, along 
                        with our pride until we have 
                        secured her husband s patronage.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What use is Glaber when Licinia can 
                        give us Marcus Crassus?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crassus' wealth is undeniable, yet 
                      he holds but the rank of senator.  
                        Glaber outweighs with that of 
                        Legatus.  The favor of both coin 
                        and title would speed our 
                        ambitions.

                        One day soon we will give Ilithyia 
                        a lesson in manners.  But for now, 
                        necessity dictates we give her 
                        Crixus. Make the arrangements.

  OFF Lucretia, realizing she has no other choice...


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Crixus stands like a bronze god as a SLAVE scrapes the grime 
  off his chiseled flesh.

                                        DURO (O.S.)
                        Fucking Gaul...

  REVERSE TO FIND AGRON AND DURO, scraping the dirt off 
  themselves as they glare at Crixus from across the bath.

                                        AGRON
                        Turn your thoughts.  I will have at 
                        him soon enough.

  Duro moves off for more oil.  Agron scrapes, his eyes 
  attempting to incinerate Crixus from a distance.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You wish your brother dead?

  Agron turns to find Spartacus behind him, SLAVES scraping 
  him.

                                        AGRON
                        Who speaks such a thing?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Your actions.

                                        AGRON
                        I only look to protect him.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And who will do so in the arena, 
                        where every man must stand alone?  
                        You do him no favors.

  Varro s ANGRY VOICE pulls Spartacus  attention to the 
  entrance of the bath.

                                        VARRO (O.S.)
                        You lie!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

  Varro slams Ashur against the wall by his throat, eyes wild, 
  intent on further violence.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Varro.

  Spartacus approaches.  Varro hisses to Ashur.

                                        VARRO
                        Tell him you lie!

                                        ASHUR
                                to Spartacus)(
                        I did only what you paid me to do.  
                        I sought out his wife, but she was 
                        not there.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The boy?

                                        ASHUR
                        I saw no one.  But there was blood, 
                        spilled upon the floor --

  Varro screams, slugging Ashur.  Ashur fights back, sending 
  them both careening into the other men.  Shouts erupt.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Varro!  Gain your senses!

  Spartacus tries to separate them.  Varro screams in rage, 
  his eyes wild.  Doctore rushes in.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Guards!  GUARDS!

  Chaos reigns as GUARDS rush in, WIPING US TO --

  INT. HOLDING CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON HANDS being secured in shackles.  POP WIDE to 
  reveal Varro struggling as Guards chain him to the wall. 
  They finish, exit.  Varro rails and thrashes, desperately 
  attempting to free himself.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        They will not break.

  Spartacus appears from the shadows on the other side of the 
  holding cell bars.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        I have tried.

  Varro gives his chains a last violent yank, grunts in 
    frustration.

                                        VARRO
                        Speak to Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Towards what purpose?

                                        VARRO
                        You have his ear.  If he would let 
                      me leave these walls for but a day 
                      or two --

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He would not allow it.

                                        VARRO
                        You will not even make attempt?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You are fortunate only to be 
                        chained.  To petition Dominus with 
                        such insanity would only provoke 
                        further punishment.  How would this 
                        help your cause?

  Varro slumps in defeat.

                                        VARRO
                      My cause is lost.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Ashur saw only blood.  No bodies.  
                        Which means your wife and child may 
                        yet be living.

                                        VARRO
                        The gods punish me, for failing 
                        them.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The gods rarely take note of fools.  
                        Now pull head from ass and use it 
                        for once! Where would your wife and 
                        boy flee, if set upon?  Think.

  OFF VARRO as he gropes for the answer -- and the frail 
  sliver of hope...


  INT. MESS HALL/PANTRY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  GUARDS pass by on their rounds.  Crixus disengages from the 
  shadows, quickly moves to the pantry gate -- and tenses to 
  find Naevia absent on the other side.  His eyes scan the 
  darkness, futilely searching for her.

                                        CRIXUS

  No reply.  He turns from the bars, troubled by her absence.

                        I could not sleep.  My mind burns 
                        with hope and desire... for the 
                        arena.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Embrace the sands of time.  As they 
                        flow, I harbor no doubt you will 
                        again be a champion.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  bitter)(
                        Capua already has its champion.

                        Spartacus bears but the title.  I 
                        look towards a man of honor to 
                        reclaim it.

  Crixus registers surprise at that.  OFF his smile, realizing 
  he has an unexpected ally in his quest to regain his 
  position...                                                                                    36.


  INT. SPARTACUS' CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus sleeps.  PAN to the door as it slowly creaks open. 
  A SHADOW slips in, cautiously creeping toward Spartacus, 
  bending close.  WHAM!  Spartacus snaps awake, instantly 
  grabbing the intruder by the throat.  He freezes, realizing 
  it s Mira.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      If you value your life... never 
                        awaken a gladiator.

  Spartacus releases her.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Return the way you came.

                        Why do you refuse me?  Am I not 
                        pleasing...

  She lets her gown fall to the floor, revealing her naked 
  perfection.  Spartacus never takes his eyes from hers.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I have no desire to lie with a 
                        woman who has been commanded to do 
                        so.

                                        MIRA
                        And what do you think will happen 
                      if I fail such a command?

  Spartacus hears the fear in her words, frowns.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Stay then.

  She smiles, taking a step towards his bed.

  He tosses her a ratty blanket.

                                        MIRA
                      Is there nothing I can do for the 
                        Champion of Capua...?

  Spartacus considers her, a thought forming.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.

                        serviced.  If you are able...

  OFF Mira, her sultry smile broadening at the prospect...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - MORNING

  Spartacus annihilates RHASKOS in the morning s training. 
  Crixus glances over, dissecting the Champion s moves for 
  future reference as he again spars with Duro.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus grins to Lucretia.

                        Spartacus breathes fire this

  Mira appears, setting breakfast on a table.  Lucretia eyes 
  her with a knowing smile.

                        I wonder to the cause.  Mira.  How 
                        did your evening pass with our 
                        champion?

                                        MIRA
                      He made... many demands of me.

  Batiatus slaps Mira on the ass as she exits.

  Lucretia gazes down at Crixus training in the morning sun, 
  her emotions well concealed.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Crixus fends off Duro, who is intent on making up for his 
  earlier defeat.  Crixus laughs, enjoying the challenge.

                        Finally, the pup bares his teeth.

  Agron glances over from his own sparring, grins at his 
  brother s performance.

  VARRO

  is hauled out into the square by Hector and another GUARD 
  and unceremoniously dumped to the sand.  Doctore frowns at 
  him.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Perhaps next time thought will 
                        precede tongue.  Pair with 
                        Spartacus.

  Varro wearily complies.  Spartacus eyes his friend s ragged 
  condition.

                        Nor is it deserved.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Embrace dreams when the sun falls.  
                        I have news.

                        Not yet.  But I have dispatched 
                        Mira, one of the house slaves, to 
                        look for her.  And your son.

  The encouraging words rally Varro.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Mira was sent by Domina.  To 
                        prepare me for... certain duties 
                        required of a champion.

                                        VARRO
                                  laughs)(
                      So the gods throw women at you, 
                        now!

  As they clash swords, MOVE ACROSS THE MEN to Crixus, 
  expertly deflecting Duro s assault -- until his attention 
  flickers to NAEVIA

  in the pantry, talking with Hector.  He unlocks the gate 
  from the mess hall and joins her inside.  As he shuts the 
  gate behind him, she LAUGHS shyly, lightly touching his arm.

  CRIXUS FILLS WITH RAGE,

  Duro taking the unfortunate brunt of it.  Crixus attacks, 
  brutally dismantling the young gladiator.

  AGRON

    instinctively moves to protect his brother, but then stops 
  short.  He locks eyes with Spartacus, remembering his words 
  from earlier, thinks better of it.

  CRIXUS

  spins, landing a VICIOUS CRACK TO DURO S JAW, lifting him 
  off his feet, BLOOD SPRAYING.  He CRASHES TO THE HARD SAND. 
  Doctore nods, pleased with the move.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Your form returns.  Pair with 
                        Hamilcar.

  Crixus, chest heaving, moves to comply.  His eyes fall to 
  the pantry as he goes, his heart dropping as he finds Naevia 
  and Hector now gone.

  DURO

  spits blood as he painfully rises, looking to his brother 
  for support.  Agron turns away, continues sparring.  Varro 
  catches the silent exchange.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.

                        brother.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Better that than his head.

  Spartacus slams into Varro, SMASHING US TO --


  INT. OFFICE - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  A BLOODY SACK THUNKS onto the table.  WIDEN TO REVEAL AULUS 
  (the henchman that killed Sura in Ep. 106) having placed it 
  there, Ashur by his side.  Batiatus eyes the sack.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It is done?

                                        ASHUR
                        The whore Despoina fucks no more.

                                        AULUS
                        Nor the man inside her when I slit 
                        her throat.

  Batiatus shifts his eyes to Ashur, questioning.

                                        ASHUR
                      It was not Solonius.

  Batiatus considers that, opens the sack.  He peers in, 
  examining the head inside (which we do not see).

                                        BATIATUS
                        Whose face do I look upon?

                                        ASHUR
                        Kastor.  One of Solonius  men.

  Batiatus considers the head, his face unreadable.  He closes 
  the sack and tosses it back to Aulus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Send it to Solonius.  Let him savor 
                        the relief of escaping death.  For 
                        the moment.

  OFF BATIATUS, already planning his next move...

  INT. ATRIUM/VILLA - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Hector and another Guard escort Spartacus to the atrium 
  where Lucretia awaits with Naevia.  Lucretia waves the 
  Guards off.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You will be bedding a proper Roman 
                        woman. Far beyond your station.  
                        Heed me well, that you not offend 
                        her.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes, Domina.

  Lucretia moves through the villa.  Spartacus follows, with 
  Naevia in tow.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Speak not a word, nor make a sound, 
                        save one of pleasure.  Follow her 
                        lead and anticipate her desires -- 
                        then fulfill them.  Vigorously.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes, Domina.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      In the arena, you are the Champion 
                      of Capua.  But tonight, you are 
                        nothing more than a common slave.  
                      To do as commanded.  Are we clear?

  She stops at a dimly lit chamber where Mira and several 
  other SLAVE GIRLS wait to prepare Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      We are clear, Domina.

  Lucretia scrutinizes him for even the slightest sign of 
  resentment or willfulness.  Finds none.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  re: Mira and Girls)(
                        They will prepare you for the 
                        festivities.  Wait until summoned.

  Spartacus gives her a head-bow and enters the chamber. Mira 
  and the Slave Girls remove his subligaria.  Lucretia takes a 
  deep breath, steeling herself for what s to come.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                      my guest well plied when she 
                        arrives.

  Naevia bows, exits.   OFF Lucretia, the importance of the 
  evening -- and something deeper -- weighing heavy...


  INT. PANTRY - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Naevia descends the stairs.  She moves to the wine jugs, 
  searching for the right one.  A silent beat, broken by --

                                        CRIXUS
                        Where were you?

  She whirls, startled to see Crixus standing in the shadows 
  outside the gate.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Last night.  I waited to the point 
                      of discovery.

                                        NAEVIA

                        I could not break away.  I was 
                        tending to Domina.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Domina...?  Or the guard I saw you 
                        with today.

  Naevia half laughs, waving that away.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You are mistaken --

                                        CRIXUS
                        I am not blind.  You laugh and 
                        touch his arm.  The way he gazes at 
                        you...

                                        NAEVIA
                      If you are not blind, then you 
                        surely see that Hector gazes at all 
                        women in the same fashion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I give no shit to other women.  You 
                        shame me.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                        You shame yourself, with thoughts 
                      of imaginary slights.

                        No.  You do not.  Nor did Hector...

  She withdraws the GATE KEY from her robe, dangling from a 
  length of cord.  Crixus stares at it in shock.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You stole his key?!

  She opens the gate.

                        I have but a moment before I must

                      to apologize for ever thinking --

  Crixus is on her as soon as the gate is open, pulling her 
  into a desperate kiss.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You are my heart... I shall never 
                        doubt the beating of it again...

  She kisses him hungrily, forgiving him.  OFF their 
  passion...


  INT. CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  QUICK RAMPED POPS as Mira and the Slave Girls rub Spartacus 
  with a mixture of GOLD FLAKES, gilding every inch of his 
  chiseled body.  Mira peers up at him with deep longing and 
  tenderness -- clearly this girl is developing feelings for 
  Spartacus.  The two lock eyes for just a moment, and then 
  Spartacus looks away.

  A GOLDEN MASK OF APOLLO

  is handed to Mira.  SPARTACUS  POV as Mira places the mask 
  over his face, WIPING US TO --


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  GUARDS stand at the periphery, blindfolded, as Spartacus 
  steps into a BROAD SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT.  MASKED AND COVERED 
  IN GOLD, he looks every bit the naked, Roman god.

  LICINIA

  reclines on a nearby sofa, a cup of wine in her hand.  She 
  wears nothing except the WHITE PORCELAIN MASK OF DIANA and a 
  loose wrap of diaphanous silk.  Her mouth parts in 
    astonishment as she takes in this figure of masculine 
  perfection wrought in living gold.

    LICINIA/DIANA RISES,

  a goddess in her own right.  The cup falls from her hand, 
  forgotten as she joins Spartacus in the moonlight.  Her hand 
  trembles in sexual expectation as it touches his chest.  An 
  electric beat.  She removes her hand, gazing at the gold 
  dust now coating her palm.  She looks up at Spartacus.

                                          LICINIA/DIANA
                                  a whisper)(
                        Take me.

  Spartacus hesitates for a fraction of a second, then does as 
  commanded.  His hands find her flesh, possessing it as he 
  eases her to the floor and enters her.  She gasps in 
  pleasure and pain, loving them both.

  SERIES OF DISSOLVES

  as Spartacus performs his duties as befitting a champion. 
  She shudders and groans, crying out in rapture, losing 
  herself deep in the animal passion of the illicit moment as 
  she rides Spartacus like a caged beast, finally freed. 
  Spartacus flips her on her back, mounts her.  Long, deep, 
  powerful thrusts, her legs wrapped tightly around his waist, 
  hands clawing at his back.

                                            LICINIA/DIANA(cont'd)

  They whip around to find Lucretia standing with ANOTHER 
  DIANA, dressed and masked exactly the same.

                        Apologies, Licinia.  It seems we ve 
                        arrived before Ilithyia has 
                        finished with Spartacus.

  Ilithyia (Licinia/Diana) stiffens, whirling to rip the mask 
  off of Spartacus.  She stares up at him in frozen horror.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        No...

  A slight smile of revenge bends Lucretia s lips.  Instead of 
  giving Ilithyia Crixus, Lucretia has maneuvered her into 
  fucking the man she hates.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Ilithyia...?

  Rage flashes across Spartacus  face as he realizes that he 
  just fucked the wife of the man that sent his own into 
  slavery.  In a flash his hands are at her throat.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  stunned)(
                        Guards!  Guards!

  The Guards rip off their blindfolds, tearing Spartacus away 
  from Ilithyia.  He struggles like a madman, enraged.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Remove him!  Now!

  The Guards haul the struggling Spartacus out of the room. 
  Ilithyia chokes, gasping for air behind her mask.  A tense 
  beat -- broken by the Other Diana, aka the real Licinia, 
  laughing as she removes her mask.

                                          LICINIA
                        Oh, would this not set every tongue 
                      in Rome to wagging.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Stop laughing...

                                          LICINIA
                        The wife of Legatus Claudius 
                        Glaber!

  Ilithyia rises, pulling the mask from her face.  Eyes wild 
  and streaked with tears.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.
  CONTINUED:

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Stop...

                                          LICINIA
                        Fucking Spartacus, the man who 
                        nearly ruined him!

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It is a scandal, is it not?

                                          LICINIA
                        The most splendid I have ever 
                        heard.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        STOP LAUGHING!

  Ilithyia loses it.  She smashes Licinia in the face with her 
  mask.  The mask shatters, sending Licinia crashing to the 
  floor.  Ilithyia pounces on her, repeatedly slamming her 
  head into the floor.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        Stop laughing!  Stop laughing!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Ilithyia!

  Lucretia pulls Ilithyia back, but it's too late.  The back 
  of Licinia's skull is crushed.  Bits of brain stain the 
  floor. She gurgles blood, spasms, lays still, eyes open.


  A BLOOD SPLATTERED ILITHYIA

  collapses into Lucretia's arms, sobbing.  Lucretia stands 
  frozen, realizing her little game has gone horribly awry. 
  CAMERA PULLS OUT into an OVERHEAD SHOT: Lucretia cradling a 
  tearful Ilithyia; Licinia, dead on the floor, her head 
  haloed by a SLOWLY EXPANDING POOL OF BLOOD.


  INT. BEDCHAMBER/PERISTYLE - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

    Shell-shocked, Ilithyia sits in the DEEP background on the 
  edge of the bed, rocking mindlessly back and forth.  RACK TO 
  FOREGROUND as Batiatus rails at Lucretia in the peristyle.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  harsh whisper)(
                        What were you thinking?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

                                        LUCRETIA
                        She slights me at every turn.  I 
                        only wished to teach her a lesson.

                                        BATIATUS
                      By pairing her with Spartacus?!

                                        LUCRETIA
                      If my husband will not defend my 
                        honor, I am forced to do so myself.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Honor?  Is that why the cousin to 
                        Marcus Crassus lays dead in our 
                        fucking house?!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        That was not my intent.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your intent matters for nothing.  
                        Fuck! We are undone!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        No. Licinia came alone.  She told 
                      no one of her purpose.

  Batiatus freezes, wheels turning.

                                        BATIATUS
                      No one?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Not even her slaves.  There is 
                        nothing to connect her with the 
                        House of Batiatus... Once her body 
                      is disposed of.

                                        BATIATUS
                        What of Ilithyia?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Leave her to me.

  OFF LUCRETIA, darkening as she turns to Ilithyia in the 
  bedroom...


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus absently scrapes the gold flecks from his skin, 
  lost in thought.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        Apologies.

  Spartacus looks up to find Batiatus entering, a Guard 
  stationed at the mouth of the bath.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It was an unfortunate mistake, 
                        coupling you with Glaber s wife.  
                        Know that it was not my intent, nor 
                      of my knowledge.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      It is I who owes apology.  For a 
                        moment my hands were not my own, 
                        but those of a man who no longer 
                        exists.

  Batiatus takes this in, nods.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let us not speak of this night 
                        again.

  He moves to exit, pauses in the doorway.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Spartacus.  Your loyalty.  It 
                        honors this ludus.

  Batiatus exits.  OFF SPARTACUS, his body partially covered 
  in gold, neither man nor god...


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Lucretia cradles Ilithyia in her arms, soothing the 
  traumatized woman.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I did not mean...

                                        LUCRETIA
                      Of course you didn t.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The way she laughed at me....  You 
                        said I was to lie with Crixus.  Why 
                        did you give Spartacus?  Why would 
                        you do such a thing?

  Lucretia pins her with a hard look.  The gloves are off.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You ask what you already know 
                        answer to.

  Ilithyia crumbles.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      My husband will see me dead for 
                        this... You have killed me...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        No.  I have brought us closer.  No 
                        one will ever know what happened 
                        this night. And Licinia's body will 
                        not be found. You are protected.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        They will know.  They will all see 
                        the deed in my eyes.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Then you will stay here.  With me.  
                        Until your eyes are clear.

  Ilithyia stares, trying to comprehend that through the 
  tears.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        You would do such a thing?  For me?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      We have had our differences, 
                        however veiled.  But I have come to 
                        realize what a valuable friend you 
                        are.

  She kisses Ilithyia on the mouth, a lingering, Judas-kiss.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        And this will be our little secret.

  Lucretia smiles, using Ilithyia s earlier words against her. 
  Ilithyia registers the sickening threat they carry, which 
  only serves to deepen Lucretia s smile...


  BLACKOUT.
