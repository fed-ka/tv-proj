          Johnny and Bruce finish up a light jog.  As they walk
          toward the front door, Johnny stretches a tight back.

                                        BRUCE
                        You crampin' up?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nah, it's just weird -- I barely
                        ditched my cane, now I'm a jogger
                        again.

                                        BRUCE
                        Gotta find some way to work off
                        that pent-up energy.
                                (then)
                        Loren says you haven't called her
                        back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, yeah.  Loren's a nice girl. 
                        I just wasn't feeling it.

                                        BRUCE
                        You weren't 'feeling' it?  You
                        had dinner.  Once.  Whatever
                          happened to 'let love grow'?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Whatever happened to 'love at
                        first sight'?

          With that, they arrive at the front door to find a large
          BOARD-LIKE OBJECT wrapped in BROWN PAPER.  Bruce tears
          off a card attached to it.

                                        BRUCE
                        'Mr.  Smith.  I hope you can help.' 
                        There's no name.

                                        JOHNNY
                        See?  Somebody out there loves
                        me.

          Bruce makes a face, and--          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TEASER - 2/1/05 - PINK  2.



          The ocean laps against a rocky coast, and we FIND...





          A stunning property.  Slightly shabby, but expansive. 
          And lived-in.  Walt's cruiser pulls up.  Bruce and Johnny
          get out of Johnny's Rover.  Walt reacts to the spread:

                                        WALT
                        So much for the starving artist.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, the good ones live large,
                        Walt.  Look at this place.  No
                        wonder he never leaves.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The man buried his first daughter. 
                                (then)
                        There's no escaping that.   

          Bruce frowns at the downer moment -- but Johnny is clearly
          taken by the spooky mystery of the place. 

          Johnny and Walt progress toward the front door, but Bruce
          hangs back, spotting the lighthouse

                                        BRUCE
                        I think that's where he works. 
                        I'm gonna check it out.

          Bruce is already taking off.  Walt's happy to let him go:

                                        WALT
                        Knock yourself out.
                                (then)
                        And Bruce -- we're guests, not
                        fans.

                                        BRUCE
                                (messing with him)
                        Damn.  Forgot my autograph book.

          And he goes.  Johnny and Walt approach the front door. 

          Johnny, still focused, knocks on the door.  No answer.

          Grabs the doorknob.  These guys have been doing it long
          enough to have that silent language: Walt looks at Johnny --
            anything?  Johnny shakes his head.



          Johnny and Walt move around back.


          JOHNNY'S POV - LIGHTHOUSE AND COASTLINE

          Johnny spots a lone figure against the water.

          Find ANDREW LYNE, a gruff older man with a shaggy beard,
          tennis shoes and paint-splattered shirt. 

          Lyne eyes something in the sand.  As he squats down to
          touch it, REVEAL Johnny and Walt approaching.

                                        WALT
                        Mr. Lyne?

          Lyne doesn't look back.  He's riveted by what he finds --
          a metal camping LANTERN.  Rusted beyond recognition.

                                        LYNE
                                (eyeing the lantern)
                        What do you think?  Maybe a jilted
                        lover was scouring the beach at
                        night, searching for a lost soul. 
                        But the flame flickered away and
                        died.

          Johnny and Walt exchange a look, then...

                                        WALT
                        Maybe somebody just threw it away.

          Lyne slowly turns.

                                        LYNE
                        Sheriff Bannerman.

          They shake hands.

                                (hates the notoriety)
                        You've read about me in the papers.

                                        LYNE
                        My daughter admired your gift. *
                        What happened to your cane?*

                        Outgrew it.

                          I see...
                                (he liked the cane)
                        It gave you an air of mystery.

          Lyne wipes his hand on his shirt. 

                                        LYNE

                        It does.  But not always on demand. 

          Lyne holds out his hand.  Johnny isn't sure how to react...

                                        LYNE
                                (quiet intensity)

                        I need someone to find her.

          Johnny shakes his hand.  Nothing.

                                        LYNE
                          Sheriff, you'll have to do it the*
                          old-fashioned way.

          Lyne moves toward the LIGHTHOUSE, they follow.

                        This place is amazing.  He's got
                          peacocks.

          That's Walt's cue to go:

          Walt gets in his car and drives away.

                        Now we go back to school.



          A sign for "Maine State College."  Pick up DYLAN QUINN --
          20, chiseled, goatee, wannabe artist -- portfolio on his
            shoulder.  He walks with Johnny and Bruce.

                                        DYLAN
                        I'm tellin' ya, Chloe never called

                                        DYLAN
                          I haven't talked to her in, like,
                        weeks.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (not buying)
                        That's a long time.

          Dylan is clearly hiding something.

                                        DYLAN
                        I told you.  She's just a friend. 
                          Besides, I don't have to tell you
                          nothin'.  Even if you are workin'
                        for the old man.

          They arrive at Dylan's car, a slightly tricked out little
          Japanese number.  As he fumbles for his keys and drops
          them, Johnny picks them up... on purpose.

          We SPIN around Johnny as he stands next to the car... and
          there's Dylan, waiting by his wheels.  He is parked in
          front of Lyne's place (near where Johnny and Walt parked
            earlier).  Chloe, carrying the suitcase she packed earlier,
          meets Dylan.

          Dylan is about to get in his car, but Johnny stops him.

                        You picked Chloe up at Lyne's

                        Where'd you take her?

                        Look, you can tell me, or you can

                        I took her to the bus station.

                        She was broke.  I had to lend her

                        She didn't blame the old man. 
                        She said he didn't know any better.

                        The cash is handled by this
                          cockroach that poses as an art
                        dealer.

                        His name's Graydon.  Promised to
                        put my stuff in a show... yeah
                        right.  Guy gives snakes a bad
                        name.

          As Johnny takes in this new info:

                                        GRAYDON (V.O.)
                                (prelap)
                        Of course I'll make it happen...



          Johnny gets in his Range Rover.  Emotionally, he's at a
          brick wall.  Bruce, right behind him, also reads his
          friend's frustration.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TWO - 2/1/05 - PINK  27.

                        Yeah.

                        I'll see ya.

          Johnny closes the door.  Then, he spots....


            A NOTEPAD ON THE WINDSHIELD

          One of those suction-cup things, for jots.  Clip-on pen.


          JOHNNY

          pulls the pad off the window, but he doesn't write.  He
          draws.  Focused.  Intense.  The way he was as Lyne in
          that vision.  He creates a woman's hair.  Her face.  We
            recognize her.  It's....



          ...The yard of a very DISTINCTIVE MANSION.  The ground is
          covered with leaves that FLUTTER past.  When Chloe looks
            back...Johnny is Lyne now.  Same garb as before.

          They venture inside....


  3030OMITTED



          Dead empty.  Leaves blow across the yard, as Johnny and
          Bruce approach, having just exited the Land Rover.

                                        BRUCE
                        Gamble House ranks with some of
                        the great salons in history. 
                          Algonquin Round Table's got nothin'
                        on this place.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All this from the one book?

                        I did some more digging.  The,

                                        BRUCE
                        Which would be fitting with Lyne's
                        view of the world.  Calm and
                          sophisticated on the surface --
                        but underneath, distorted,
                          unexpected, out of control.  That's
                        why he paints with blurred focus. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        To obscure the truth.

          At that moment, Johnny pushes through the gate at the
          bottom of the steps, and WHOOSH he sees --


  3737CHLOE IN A WINDOW - VISION - DAY

          Johnny rushes to the front door. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's here.

                        Chloe!  

          Johnny finds the door locked.  Gets frustrated.  He is
          intent on getting in.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny, easy, man--

          Johnny checks another window.  Chloe's in that one, too. 
          (This time we see she's in the white dress.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hang on, Chloe!  

          Johnny tries the door again, and suddenly....


  3838THE WORLD GOES DARK

          Johnny looks back, and Bruce is gone -- and DAY BECOMES
          NIGHT IN THREE SECONDS.

          When Johnny looks back to the door, it opens, as a well-
          dressed couple heads out.  Inside: The ANTIQUE-FILLED
          HOUSE (as we saw before).          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TWO - 2/1/05 - PINK  33.



          Johnny lets go of the front door.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                        She's not his daughter, Bruce...
                        Chloe's not Lyne's daughter.

          The revelation hits them, and we....

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:


          Johnny leans the Chloe painting against the house.  Johnny
          has his mini-chemistry-set thing going out here -- and
          he's got Bruce mixing chemicals in a container.    

                                        BRUCE
                        I can't believe I'm agreeing to
                        this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It'll work.  The older paint's
                        got a different composition, so
                        once we apply the--

                                        BRUCE
                        It's nuts, Johnny!  This is
                          priceless art and you're about to
                        go Mr. Wizard all over its ass. 
                        I will not be a party to this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then don't.

          Johnny pulls the jug from his hand.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, man.  Wait, wait!

          Bruce can barely watch --

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, but if God's an art lover,
                        you better be prepared to do a
                        lot of explaining.

          As Johnny pours the CHEMICAL SOLUTION along the top of
          the painting.  It streaks down...

          And bleeds the Chloe painting away.

          It REVEALS another painting beneath.  The sky and the
          rocky shore behind Lyne's house.  Johnny pours a second
          wave of the stuff.

          And Julia emerges -- posed exactly, and positioned in the
          same part of the canvas as Chloe.  It's as if Julia emerges
          directly from under her.

          Eerie. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn.  She could be Chloe's twin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the idea.

          ON the image of Julia, we hear:

                                        WALT (V.O.)
                                (prelap)
                        Julia Lyne died fifteen years
                        ago.



          Sheriffs cruisers parked outside.  DEPUTY ROSCOE leads
          several other deputies toward the house.  They cross
          Johnny, Bruce and Walt.

                                        WALT
                                (to Roscoe)
                        I want a full sweep, inside and
                        out.

                                        ROSCOE
                        On it, boss.

          Johnny and Walt move on, toward the studio, as Graydon
          meets them.

                                        GRAYDON
                        I'm not going to allow --

                                        WALT
                                (hands him a paper)
                        That's a warrant, Mr. Graydon.  I
                        suggest you read it.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Based on what?  You are not going
                        to put my friend through this.

                        You just had to have some new
                          paintings to sell, didn't you? 
                        So you found the right girl and
                        turned her into his long lost
                          daughter.

          Graydon freezes at the realization.  They know. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (holds out hand)
                        Wanna shake my hand now?

          Graydon is a deer in the headlights, when--

                                        LYNE (O.S.)
                        Tom.

          Lyne is at the large open doors to his studio.  More
          disheveled and unshaven than we remember.

                                        LYNE
                        It's alright.  Let them look.  A
                        word Mister Smith, if you wouldn't
                        mind?



          Roscoe regroups with Johnny, Walt and Bruce.  They are
          out in front, near the cars.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Nothing out of the ordinary. 
                        Unless you count unfinished
                          sketches of the missing girl in
                        every corner of the place.

                                        BRUCE
                        We must be missing something.

                                        WALT
                                (to Johnny)
                        We're still dead in the water.

          Johnny doesn't want to believe that.  He eyes Graydon on
          the front steps of the house, arguing with a DEPUTY. 

          It gives Johnny an INSTINCT, which he promptly acts on...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Roscoe.  Did Graydon give you
                        back the warrant?

                                        ROSCOE
                        Still got the slime on it.

          Roscoe finds it in his shirt pocket, folded up.  Hands it
          back to Johnny.  The second Johnny touches it...


  4949VISION - NEW ANGLE ON JOHNNY - NIGHT

          NIGHT FALLS and Walt and Roscoe are already gone -- as
          Chloe suddenly rushes past Johnny.  She has her favorite
          SUITCASE in hand...and she heads for Dylan's car out by
          the street.  Dylan, inside, hasn't spotted her.   



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - THREE - 2/1/05 - PINK  44.


    49CONTINUED:49

          It's right before the Act I moment when Chloe left with
          Dylan, but now we have Graydon's perspective -- as he
          appears from the shadows, stopping her. 

                                        GRAYDON
                        Chloe, this is nuts.  Don't do
                        this to him.  To yourself.

          Graydon takes her by the arm -- then touches her. 
          Intimately.

          This guy is all sleaze.  Chloe pushes him away.

                                        CHLOE
                        I'm not the one hurting him. 
                        He's a great man -- and you're
                        destroying him.  

                                        GRAYDON
                        You really fell for it, didn't
                        you.  The Andrew Lyne mystique.

                        People should know his life is
                        controlled by a sleazy --

          Graydon slaps her.  Johnny instinctively wants to help,
          but obviously can't. 

                                        GRAYDON
                        Listen real close.  Mr. Lyne's
                        got his secrets, but you know
                        what?  I control them.  And you're
                        one of those secrets now.  You
                        even think about going public --

                                        CHLOE
                        You can't hurt me any more than
                        you already have.

                                        GRAYDON
                        What about the old man?  You think
                        I could hurt him? 

          Chloe hadn't considered that.  She wriggles herself free.

                                                                      FLASH BACK TO:


  5050OUTSIDE LYNE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny, still holding the warrant, watches Graydon.  Walt
          and Roscoe look on.

                        Walt.  I'll be in touch.

          Johnny walks away, as Bruce follows him.  Off Walt....

                                                                                CUT TO:



          Where Bruce and Johnny met Graydon in Act I.  It's after
          hours.  The place is empty.  Graydon hurries to the front
          door and taps the number code lock as the door buzzes and
          open.  He enters.  

          We're behind him, FOLLOWING HIM.  He rushes to his desk
          and opens a drawer.

          INSIDE: A locked compartment.  He opens it with a key he
          has hidden under a vase.

          He extracts paperwork jammed into a file.  Got what he
          wanted.  But as he rushes out....

          He crosses with Johnny.  But Graydon doesn't acknowledge
          him.

          This has all been a VISION.

                                                                              WHOOSH TO:



          Johnny and Bruce outside.  Johnny releases the handle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's worried.  He's gonna show up
                        any second and pull something out
                        of his desk.

                                        BRUCE
                          Something he doesn't want us to
                        find.

          Yep.  Johnny quickly enters the correct code into the
          door lock and it opens.

                                        BRUCE
                        Remind me to bring you along on
                        my next bank heist.

          They slip inside...          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - THREE - 2/1/05 - PINK  46.



          NO BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT.

          Johnny, as Lyne, walks onto the beach... but Julia is NOT
          at his feet...  The brown-haired girl walks in front of
          him, just turning around -- but wait, it's Chloe, not
          Julia!  In her white dress!

          Johnny/Lyne SWINGS the rock at Chloe's head!  He hits her
          again!  The murder is interspersed with HARROWING POV as
          we --

          Nora walks toward the rocky coast.  Reveal Chloe in front
          of her.  In the white dress.

                        phone you made it sound like he
                        might hurt himself.

                        He's been so lost without you. 
                        He needed to take a walk, to clear
                        his head.

          Walt's cruiser pulls up.  He and Johnny and Bruce rush
          out.

                        Wait--

          Johnny spots Nora's apron.  Discarded near the door on
          the way out. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is Nora's.

          Johnny touches it.  WHOOSH!


  6666VISION - MATCH & MOVE AROUND THE CANVAS

          As Nora appears, at a canvas, putting her apron on to
          start a day of work.

          Johnny is at a canvas, beside Nora, watching in THIRD
          PERSON.  This is her memory.  Lyne enters, a spring in
          his step.

                                        LYNE
                        Did you see that sunrise?

                          Someone's full of energy today.

          Lyne sips coffee. 

                                        LYNE
                        I've been thinking.  Chloe's an
                        art student.  And she knows her
                        way around a studio.  She has an
                          extraordinary eye for color.

          Nora stops priming.

                                        NORA
                        What are you saying? 

                                        LYNE
                        Perhaps it's time for a change. 
                        Time for you to fly on your own. 
                        God knows I've taught you all I
                        can.

                                        NORA
                        But I like it here.  I like being
                        with you.

                                        LYNE
                        It's best for both of us if you
                        go.  You'll be free.  

          Now Nora looks at him, betrayed and hurt.

                                        NORA
                        She's not even family.

          He touches her face.

                                        LYNE
                        But you know this -- you can never
                        be my muse.  

          Nora is quietly crushed.  Johnny sees this, and WHOOSH! 


  6767BACK OUTSIDE THE STUDIO

          Johnny comes out of it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora... She was his only real
                          daughter...



          ... Nora, on the rocky coast.  Chloe looks out, now wearing
          that familiar white dress.

                                        CHLOE
                        Are you sure he's on his way back?

                        He'll be here. 

          Chloe feels good about what's coming.

                                        CHLOE
                        I'm glad you called.  You've always
                        been so good to me, Nora.  In a
                        way, I feel like we're almost
                          ...sisters.

          Chloe smiles, feeling at home.  Nora smiles back.

          As Chloe looks back at the coastline, Nora looks down.

          Nora eyes a ROCK.  Big one.  Perfect for bludgeoning.

          We recognize it as the one Johnny held in his vision.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - FOUR - 2/1/05 - PINK  55.

          ... Nora picks up the rock.

          Chloe looks down the beach.  She spots a lone figure. 
          Lyne is approaching.

                                        CHLOE
                        I see him.

                        Good.  I want him to look at you. 
                        I want him to find you exactly
                        where he found her.

          Chloe stops and turns... 

                                        CHLOE
                        Who?

                        Julia.

          Nora hits Chloe in the forehead with the rock.  Chloe
          falls to the sand.

          Just then, Johnny, Bruce and Walt rush toward the rocks.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora!

          Nora sees them.  But doesn't care.  She is over a
          dumbstruck Chloe.

                                        NORA
                        He's my father.  And I'm his only
                        muse.

          Nora raises the rock, as...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora, wait!  You don't want to do
                        this.

          Nora shivers, the cold wind whipping around her.  She
          suddenly seems torn -- confused.

                        It's not right.  He should be

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, it's all been a lie.  And
                        you wanted me to see that lie,
                        didn't you, Nora?  That's why you
                        sent me the painting.

          We realize he's right.  She did send him the painting.

                        So you could stop hurting.

          Johnny eases closer, as Nora breaks into tears...

                                        NORA
                        I just wanted him to love me.  To

                        I know.

          Johnny gently takes the rock from her hand as she crumbles
          into his arms.  Walt and Bruce react.  The moment Johnny 
          touches her...

          Johnny lets go of Nora.  By now, Walt has pitched in,

          Johnny goes to a dazed Chloe, a slight trickle of blood
          moving down her face.  For a moment, it reminds him of
          his VISION.
