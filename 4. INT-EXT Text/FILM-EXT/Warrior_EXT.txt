A beautiful blue-collar city approaching nightfall. Bridges.
Rivers. Churches. The working class poetry of the `Burgh.
PADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church
holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other
PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes.
Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and
drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He
listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight
bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view,
Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue-
collar neighborhood high above the city.
TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the
stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter
coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a
brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops
a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the
approaching night.
Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off
the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he
approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his
eyes.
PADDY
Tommy?
Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.
PADDY (CONT'D)
What're you doing here?
TOMMY
I was just passing through. Figured
why not have a belt with the old
man.
2.
Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a
long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.
TOMMY (CONT'D)
She looks good.
PADDY
(patting car hood)
Yeah, she's hanging in there.
TOMMY
Well, you always did take good care
of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of
priorities.
Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the
stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a
fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
TOMMY (CONT'D)
Got a little something for ya. Mom
always said never go anywhere empty
handed.
PADDY
She did. But that's not for me
anymore, Tommy.
TOMMY
What? You change brands?
Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not
drinking? What gives?
PADDY
C'mon, let's go inside.
Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a
confused Tommy follows.
TITLE CARD: WARRIOR
A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class
home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run
about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some
whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces
painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY.
TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like
a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA.
She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a
lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up.
THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A
BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN
AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN.
TESS
What's going on here?
BRENDAN
Well, I'm not sure, but I think
Daddy is now a princess.
Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here"
expression.
TESS
Em, you want to open your presents?
The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents."
Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with
gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.
Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to
the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered
in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.
TESS (CONT'D)
(off pink box)
This an awfully big box.
BRENDAN
It's her birthday.
Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't
look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift
with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.
7.
TESS
(TEASING)
I know, but that's why you call it
a budget. You set it, and you don't
budge.
Brendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife.
The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the
lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to
her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set.
She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan
pressing free weights on an old bench.
Brendan pulls into the parking lot of the local strip club. A
white TENT is set up outside, and the parking lot is
overflowing with cars. Something big going on.
A steady rain tumbles down over an old-school diner in the
shadow of the railroad tracks.
Marine base camp in the middle of the Iraqi desert. Blackhawk
HELICOPTERS floating in the sky. MARINES rushing about.
Bradford hustles outside into the searing sunlight.
Brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out
of his Camry, and looks to the street, where Paddy stands
outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door.
Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. He's
clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there,
uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street
lamp.
PADDY
Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop.
BRENDAN
What're you doing here?
PADDY
I have some news for you.
BRENDAN
Something wrong with your hands?
Paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
If there's nothing wrong with your
hands then there's no reason for
you not to phone. That's the deal.
37.
PADDY
Yeah, I forgot--
BRENDAN
Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.
Paddy holds his hands out, palms down.
PADDY
Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my
hands so steady? Have you?
BRENDAN
I'm going inside.
PADDY
I've got a thousand days. A
thousand days sober today.
BRENDAN
Well, that's great, Pop. But it
doesn't change anything.
PADDY
What do you mean it doesn't change
anything? Have a heart, Brendan.
Paddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen
before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely.
BRENDAN
You listen to me. You take your
have-a-heart bullshit and you run
it down the road. Run it out on
someone who doesn't know you like I
do.
PADDY
C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we
could break bread. Open some lines
of communication.
BRENDAN
You got two lines of communication,
the telephone and the post office.
Just because you decide it's a
special day, it doesn't make it one
for me. I got a wife and kids
inside and they're waiting for me,
so I don't have time for whatever
this is.
38.
PADDY
I know you got a wife and kids in
there. I got a grand-daughter I
haven't seen in three years and
another I haven't even ever met.
BRENDAN
Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do
you remember having anything to do
with that?
Paddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
That shit you pulled. Never again.
And all the shit I saw growing up?
That doesn't happen here.
Brendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on
his face. Then he heads for the house.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
Take care of yourself.
As he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out.
PADDY
Tommy's back.
Brendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad.
PADDY (CONT'D)
He's in the `Burgh.
BRENDAN
Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
PADDY
He came to see me.
BRENDAN
He came to see you?
PADDY
He's over at the house. We're doing
a little training at Fitzy's.
Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's
anymore.
Brendan walks closer. Incredulous.
BRENDAN
You and Tommy are training
together?
39.
Paddy nods.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
Tommy Conlon.
PADDY
Riordan. He's using your mother's
maiden name now.
BRENDAN
I know what her name is.
PADDY
I thought you'd want to know he's
back. That's why I drove all the
way over here.
BRENDAN
I thought you came to break bread
over a thousand days?
PADDY
That too.
Brendan looks at him. Considers.
BRENDAN
Did he say if he wants to see me?
PADDY
He doesn't say much. He's just not
that happy kid he was.
BRENDAN
Wow, look at you. Mister inside
man.
Paddy frowns.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
You and Tommy training together
like nothing ever happened. This is
unbelievable. Now I know what
you're really doing here.
PADDY
What's that?
BRENDAN
You came to gloat.
PADDY
I did not come to gloat. I came to
get my son back.
40.
BRENDAN
Well, there you go. You got your
son back.
PADDY
I'm talking about you, Bren--
BRENDAN
You got your son back.
Brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
You know, part of the reason I
stuck around was `cause I thought
I'd finally get you all to myself.
But you didn't have any interest in
training me. Tommy was the one.
PADDY
Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean,
you know. I'm sorry.
BRENDAN
Forget it. You were always a front
runner. You never had any interest
in underdogs. But I was your son.
PADDY
You are my son.
BRENDAN
Am I?
PADDY
Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you
to find just a little space in your
heart to forgive me.
BRENDAN
Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I
do not trust you. Tell Tommy this
is where I am if he wants to see
me.
PADDY
Alright. But they're not different
things. You've gotta trust to
FORGIVE--
BRENDAN
Goodnight, Pop.
41.
Paddy looks toward the house, where Emily, Rosie, and Tess
stand at the door. Paddy waves.
PADDY
My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's
grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie?
Brendan keeps walking. Opens his door to step inside.
ROSIE
Daddy, who is that?
BRENDAN
Just some nice old man.
Brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken Paddy alone
in the yard.
Tommy, his hoodie drenched, jogs up the sidewalk and enters
the gym.
Tommy, hoodie up, runs in the darkness as Paddy's Olds trails
behind him, the SOUND of "Moby Dick" playing in the car.
Frank watches as a team of FIGHTERS races up a steep hill.
Marco is ahead of the pack, Brendan in the middle.
Tommy runs hard through an industrial area along the
Allegheny River. The sky, the steel, the bridges,
everything's hard and gray.
Brendan takes steady blows from an OPPONENT in another
smoker, then turns the tables, slams his man down, and chokes
him out. His skills are improving.
J.J. RILEY (V.O.)
...but with this type of format,
it's gonna be tough to deny who the
champion is.
In an expansive and grim scrap yard along the river bank,
Tommy somehow manages to lift and flip old long-haul rig
tires. They're roughly the size of hot tubs. His strength is
astonishing.
J.J. RILEY (V.O.)
You've got four fights in two
nights, sixteen fighters down to
one. Winners gonna be the last man
standing.
Everyone charging up the hill with Frank pushing them. Marco
leads the charge again, but Brendan is gaining and a close
second.
Tommy runs across the bridge as Paddy follows behind in the
Olds, right at his heels. The pace is relentless.
45.
Tommy pounds on tires with a sledge hammer as Paddy exhorts
him on. It's a brutal regimen.
Brendan works over another FIGHTER in a smoker. He looks
fantastic and submits the guy with slick Jiu Jitsu.
Up the hill they race, Brendan now leading the way and Marco
struggling to catch up with him.
Tommy keeps running, Paddy in the Olds right behind him.
FRANK (V.O.)
You've gotta relax and stay calm in
there. The cage is your home. You
set the pace.
Tommy keeps pushing the giant tires until he finally reaches
the end of the yard. He's ready.
Frank, Brendan, and group of other FIGHTERS stand at the
bottom of the hill and tend to Marco Santos, who has just
badly INJURED HIS KNEE.
END OF TRAINING MONTAGE
48.
An AMBULANCE pulls in front of the ER.
Brendan pulls a garbage bin down to the curb as Tess walks
out of the house talking on a cordless PHONE.
TESS (INTO PHONE)
Yeah, the girls are good. They're
good. Yeah, you should. You've been
spending so much time with Brendan
these days it's like you're part of
the family or something. Yeah, he's
right here.
(handing phone to Brendan)
It's your boyfriend.
BRENDAN (INTO PHONE)
Hey Frank.
(BEAT)
That's unbelievable. I can't thank
you enough. I don't know what to
say. Alright, listen, I've gotta
call you back. Alright, bye.
Brendan hangs up the phone. Looks at Tess.
50.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
I'm in. I'm going.
A look of serious concern crosses Tess's face. She puts her
hands on her hips.
TESS
Really? So that's your decision?
You decided? `Cause I really
enjoyed that conversation we just
had about making that decision
together.
Brendan doesn't say anything. Knows she's right. And that
he's about to get laid into.
TESS (CONT'D)
You told me you were gonna fight
guys that watched too much UFC. I
saw that Koba dude on TV, and he's
the guy they're watching.
BRENDAN
It's a lot of money, Tess.
TESS
I don't give a shit about the
money, Brendan. I told you that.
We're gonna end up cashing in your
life insurance policy before we
pick up that prize money.
BRENDAN
You don't think I can do it.
TESS
I think you can get killed.
BRENDAN
I'm not gonna get killed.
TESS
Fine, you're not going to get
killed. But can you promise me
you're not going to get hurt?
You're not gonna end up in the
hospital? You're not gonna end up
paralyzed? We'll have no prize
money. No house. Payments for
HOSPITAL BILLS--
51.
BRENDAN
Tess, I can promise you this: if I
don't try, they're gonna take the
house. How's that for a promise?
No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd
really love it if you'd be with me
on this.
Tess looks at her husband. Wants to support him, but can't.
TESS
I'm not gonna watch you fight
again. I'm not.
(BEAT)
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.
Tess starts walking back toward the house. She marches up the
lawn without turning back, leaving Brendan, alone, in front
of his house. He looks at the toys strewn across the yard.
Surveys the neighborhood. He's going to Sparta.
CALLEN (V.O.)
Fourth of July weekend doesn't
officially start until tomorrow...
Sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches, hotels, and
boardwalks of AC. Thousands of PEOPLE jam the outside of the
majestic Boardwalk Hall. It seems as if everyone on earth is
in town.
CALLEN (V.O.)
...but fight fans are already
descending on Atlantic City for the
Super Bowl of Mixed Martial Arts,
Sparta.
BILLBOARDS heralding the arrival of the SPARTA tournament are
everywhere. Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam
Ocean Avenue, early FIREWORKS pop. The buzz is electric. The
greatest show on earth has hit the shore.
52.
LIMOUSINES pull up in front of the Boardwalk Hall rotunda as
"Mad Dog" Grimes, Orlando "Midnight" Le, Karl "The Dane"
Kruller, and other fighters make their way down a long red
carpet swarming with FANS.
In the middle of it all is J.J. Riley, greeting press and
guests and running the show as the Tapout crew, Colt Boyd,
and others mill about and talk shop. Announcers BRYAN CALLEN
(40s) and SAM SHERIDAN (30s) corral J.J. for an interview.
CALLEN
J.J., you've made a fortune with
your hedge funds, yet you turned
your back on Wall Street and
dedicated your life to making
Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this
tournament so important to you?
J.J. RILEY
Growing up, we all wanted to know
who the toughest kid in the
neighborhood was, right? I wanna
know who the toughest man on the
planet is. That's why I put this
together, that's what all these
people are here to see, and come
Saturday night, that's what we're
gonna find out.
SHERIDAN
Thank you, J.J. And here's
something fans never thought they'd
see: Koba is here! The legend
arriving to fight on U.S. soil for
the very first time...
The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo,
trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS.
FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie
premiere out there and Koba's the star.
The sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of Atlantic
City, and sinks into the sea.
Brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the Atlantic Ocean
lap at the shoreline. Boats bob on the water. Stray bottle
rockets trace through the night sky.
In the distance, the NEON LIGHTS of an amusement park flash
and zip. Behind Brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements
for Sparta filling their BILLBOARDS.
Brendan continues walking, then spots Tommy coming toward
him. The brothers make eye contact. Stop. Then approach each
other warily.
BRENDAN
Been looking all over for you.
How's it going?
TOMMY
It's going.
BRENDAN
I was thinking maybe we could grab
a coffee.
TOMMY
I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
BRENDAN
You don't want to go sit down
somewhere?
TOMMY
I'm good right here.
56.
Brendan looks at Tommy. Sees how rigid he is. A long silence.
Finally Brendan cuts right to it.
BRENDAN
Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to
know I was never gonna see you guys
again?
TOMMY
You were briefed. You had the
information. You chose the old man
and the girl.
BRENDAN
She wasn't some girl. I married
her. She's my wife.
Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent
Christmas PHOTO of Tess, Emily, and Rosie from his wallet.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
(handing Tommy the picture)
That's Tess. And that's Emily and
Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy.
Tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back.
TOMMY
Don't know `em.
BRENDAN
I know you don't know them. Of
course you don't know them.
TOMMY
Why am I looking at pictures of
people I don't know?
BRENDAN
Because that's my family.
TOMMY
And who are you exactly?
BRENDAN
I'm your brother, man.
TOMMY
You were in the Corps?
BRENDAN
What?
57.
TOMMY
I said I didn't know you were in
the Corps.
BRENDAN
I wasn't in the Corps.
TOMMY
Then you ain't no brother to me. My
brother was in the Corps.
With that, Tommy walks briskly away from Brendan and up the
beach. His brother runs after him.
BRENDAN
Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old
kid. What the hell did I know?
TOMMY
I don't know what you know. Why
don't you go ask your girlfriend
about it?
BRENDAN
She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it?
I stay with Tess and I never get to
see you guys again? Not a single
phone call? Nothing?
No response from Tommy. He's a wall.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
God, man, I don't understand this.
You won't forgive me, but you'll
forgive Pop?
TOMMY
Shit. He's just some old vet I
train with. He means nothing to me.
From what I hear he means nothing
to you, either, so you got balls
talking about forgiveness.
BRENDAN
That's got nothing to do with
forgiveness. I've got a family to
protect. Everything I do is for
them.
Tommy smirks. Walks away again.
BRENDAN (CONT'D)
But I forgave Pop. Just like I
forgave you and Mom.
58.
TOMMY
(TURNING AROUND)
You forgave us?
BRENDAN
Yeah.
TOMMY
I'm not surprised you made the
tournament, Brendan. You got some
stones.
BRENDAN
I fell in love, Tommy. What the
hell was I supposed to do?
TOMMY
You were supposed to stick to the
plan. You were supposed to come
with us. Mom needed you. I needed
you. You were my big brother and
you bailed on me.
The words hit Brendan hard.
TOMMY (CONT'D)
Hey, I'm glad you stayed and
everything worked out for you,
Brendan. See, you leave, you get
the opposite. You leave, you get to
bury people.
BRENDAN
You're not the only one who
suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know
she was sick. I never even got the
chance to say goodbye to my own
mother. You had no right to keep
that from me! That was not your
decision to make!
TOMMY
You know what? You walk around with
your pictures in your wallet and
you're all, I forgive you, I
forgive Pop. I forgive everyone.
But you know what? You're full of
shit.
Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing
on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for
a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.
59.
TOMMY (CONT'D)
Are we done, Brendan? Are we
finished?
Tommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity.
Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say.
Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach.
Sunny day. And a nearly abandoned school parking lot.
The Goodyear BLIMP, "SPARTA IS HERE" blinking on it, floats
over Atlantic City. FIREWORKS explode majestically above
Boardwalk Hall and fall into the sea, where hundreds of boats
bob, televisions tuned to Sparta visible from many of them.
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE cram the beach and boardwalk, crane their
necks toward the sky, and watch the stunning pyrotechnics. In
the streets, limos line up on Ocean Avenue. Even from a
distance, the excitement and energy are palpable.
CALLEN (V.O.)
The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena! It might be
Fourth of July weekend, but this is
Christmas Eve for fight fans! This
is Atlantic City! This is the War
on the Shore! And this is what
everyone has been waiting for!
Enormous electronic BILLBOARDS flash outside of the giant
seaside casinos. On one, Koba hangs off the side of a ferris
wheel and swats at smaller fighters buzzing around him in a
replication of the iconic "King Kong" movie scene.
61.
CALLEN (V.O.)
Sixteen of the baddest men on the
planet duking it out over a 24-hour
period for the largest purse in
Mixed Martial Arts history. In the
town everyone knows from the game
of Monopoly, we've got ourselves a
winner-take-all affair. Buckle your
seatbelts, roll the dice, and take
riiiiide on the Reading. Sparta.
Is. Here!
Dawn breaks over Atlantic City.
Fourth of July weekend in full swing down the Shore.
A bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before
explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on
the beach and boardwalk have swelled. It seems as if the
entire east coast has descended on AC.
Outside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a
new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a
ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero
outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course.
Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him
down, and below the three of them, in miniature, is Brendan
holding a sling shot.
82.
"ODE TO JOY" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF
CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot.
Pull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater
packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN,
Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As
he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC,
Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class
root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B.
As the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a
familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito
shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here.
Thousands of people staring at the drive-in screen and you
can hear a pin drop. They're aghast. Zito can hardly look. KC
buries her head in Nash's chest.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE SLAUGHTER CONTINUES. HOW BRENDAN IS
TAKING IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS.
The parking lot is quiet and tense. Zito and the kids stare
at the movie screen.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: KOBA PRESSES BRENDAN UP AGAINST THE CAGE AND
TRIES TO CHOKE HIM OUT.
The drive-in crowd goes absolutely BERSERK. Tito leaps into
Nash's arms. Stephon hugs KC. Zito pumps his fist in the air.
CALLEN (V.O.)
That's gotta be the biggest upset
in MMA history! Brendan Conlon has
tapped the great Koba!
Tito and the kids sit on the hoods of cars eating hot dogs
and waiting for the final fight. Joe Zito looks up at the
movie screen, where Bryan Callen makes an announcement.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: A SURPRISED CALLEN.
CALLEN (ON SCREEN)
We've just got some incredible news
that I'm having trouble putting
into context, but here it is: the
two men fighting for the
championship tonight, for the five
million dollar prize, for the
middle weight championship of the
world, are brothers.
Stunned expressions from Zito, KC, Nash, Stephon, Tito, and
everyone at the Drive-In. The wild night has taken an
unexpected turn.
A sobered up Paddy runs out of the hotel and climbs into a
waiting taxi.
People stand on cars. Chairs. Each other's shoulders.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE BATTERED BRENDAN CONTINUES HIS WALK,
WADING THROUGH A CROWD THAT IS AS PUMPED AS HE IS SOMBER.
Tito, KC, Nash, Stephon, and the other students start
chanting "Mis-ter C! Mis-ter C! Mis-ter C!"
The crowd is tense and subdued. It's not going well.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: TOMMY KEEPS TATTOOING BRENDAN WITH HEAD
SHOTS. BEATS HIS BROTHER WITH MALICE. IT'S HARD TO WATCH.
Very quiet at the Drive-In. It's tough for everyone to watch
what's happening to Brendan.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: ROUND TWO. A REPEAT OF ROUND ONE. TOMMY JUST
WHALING ON BRENDAN AND BRENDAN TRYING TO HANG ON FOR DEAR
LIFE.
The crowd fired up by Brendan's comeback, and mesmerized by
what's taking place in the cage between the brothers. It's
complete and utter chaos in there.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: TOMMY PACES IN HIS CORNER, HIS SHOULDER
WRECKED. JOSH ROSENTHAL TRIES TO SEE IF HE'S ALRIGHT BUT
TOMMY TURNS AWAY. HE'S NOT QUITTING AND NO ONE'S GOING TO
TELL HIM HE HAS TO.
Zito and the kids staring at the screen, imploring Brendan to
take the helpless Tommy out and win the championship.
The crowd wants a victory. Tito and the boys start the "Mis-
ter C!" chant again.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: FRANK ADMONISHES BRENDAN IN HIS CORNER. IT'S
OBVIOUS WHAT HE'S TELLING HIM, BUT BRENDAN'S EYES ARE FAR
AWAY. HE'S NOT LISTENING TO A WORD.
While most of the crowd erupts in celebration and the kids
leap into each other's arms, Joe Zito stares at the screen.
ON MOVIE SCREEN: AS PEOPLE ENTER THE RING, BRENDAN AND TOMMY
STAY ON THE GROUND, BRENDAN CRADLING HIS BROTHER IN HIS ARMS.
103.
