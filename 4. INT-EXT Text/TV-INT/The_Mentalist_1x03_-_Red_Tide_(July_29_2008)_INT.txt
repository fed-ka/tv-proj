      A flurry of activity -- CHO and LISBON organize fingerprint 
      gear, load guns, pack evidence kits -- preparing to head out. 

      (In the b.g., JANE and VAN PELT walk around the room close 
      together (we don t know why yet), drawing closer to Lisbon.)  
      ON A MONITOR near Lisbon, a YEARBOOK PHOTO of our Teenage 
      Victim, smiling and happy (and wearing braids).  As RIGSBY 
      enters --

                                  LISBON
                    Victim is Christine Tanner, 
                    fifteen.  Drowned.  Washed up on 
                    the beach in Santa Marta.
                          (to the room)
                    Who s got the ultraviolet?

      Rigsby tosses her the ultraviolet wand, starts packing.

                                  RIGSBY
                    So she drowned.  Why us?

                    The killer s clever, but not quite 
                    as clever as he thinks he is.

                    bodies in the water are State

      Lisbon eyes the photo of Christine on her computer screen.  
      The girl looks so happy.  

      Jane and Van Pelt near Lisbon, occasionally turning this way 
      or that.  Now Lisbon, puzzled, sees Jane has his hand lightly 
      on Van Pelt s wrist, as if taking her pulse while they walk.  
      Jane s very intense, eyes half-closed as if seeing something 
      no one else can.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    All right, what are you doing?

                                  JANE
                    Grace is mentally telling me where 
                    she hid the keys to the van.  If I 
                    find them, I get to drive.

                                  LISBON
                    So now you are a psychic.

                                  JANE
                    No no.  It s all science. 

      Jane, still touching Van Pelt s wrist, pirouettes away with 
      her, an eerie, slow-motion waltz.  Lisbon and the others 
      can t help watching...  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Keep concentrating, Grace... With

      Jane puts out his hand as if feeling a vibration in the

                    would be a trick.

      Jane reaches past Van Pelt, into the planter behind her.  
      Pulls out the keys.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A dark cluttered wreck of a room.  Decent TV.  Lisbon and Van 
      Pelt talk to DAMON TANNER, mid-30's, Christine s father.  
      Hollow-eyed and beaten down, a drinker -- Christine s loss 
      only the latest blow.  Next to him on the couch is LISA, a 
      tough 12.  In a broken La-Z-Boy is MICAH, 7, playing on a 
      battered old Gameboy.  Both are pale and exhausted from 
      weeping. 

      Van Pelt s watching Lisbon like a hawk, trying to learn.

                                  TANNER
                    Excuse the mess.  Chris was the 
                      house-proud one round here.

                                  LISBON
                    We understand.  Mr. Tanner, we may 
                    have to ask some tough questions.  

      She looks at the kids meaningfully.

                    Lisa nothing she hasn t heard 
                    before, and Micah don t give a 
                    shit.  Slow.  He s only sad because 
                    he sees Lisa is.

                    When did you notice Christine

                                  TANNER 
                    Yesterday morning.  She hadn t made 
                    nothing for the kids.  I realized I 
                    hadn t seen her in a while.  She 
                    might be away for one night without 
                    my knowing, but...

                    Any idea where she was during that 
                    time period?

                                  TANNER
                    No.  Chrissy s real independent.  
                    Never had to worry about Chrissy.

                    It takes you two days to notice 
                    your child is gone and another day

                    College kid.  Walked away laughing.  
                    Not a scratch.  You know?  Not a 
                    scratch. 

      Lisbon just stares at him, as if she had gone away somewhere 
      in her mind.  Van Pelt waits a beat, expecting Lisbon to take 
      up the questioning.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    So, Christine kind of took over 
                    from her mom huh?  Cleans.  Cooks.  
                    Looks after the little ones.

                    Yeah.  I don t know what we re 
                    going to do now.

      Lisbon comes back.  Evidently she s been somewhere rough.  
      Looks at her notes.

                                  LISBON
                    Christine was arrested last year.

                                  TANNER 
                    She wasn t into drugs.  She was  
                    straight edge, if anything.  It was 
                    her dumbass friend Marla.

                    big into surfing.  Started hanging

      WIDER as Cho sits at his temp desk, taps at a computer

                    I would.  But me and Chris didn t

                    that might have reason to do this?

      Marla shrugs, but starts thinking.

                    Maybe she s been hooking up with 
                    somebody she shouldn t have?

      A name obviously occurs to Marla.  A sly look fades in.

                                  MARLA 
                    Now that you mention it...

      Lisbon has heard that tone before.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes, Marla.  If you help us, I ll 
                    talk to the prosecutor.  See if I 
                    can help you on these charges you 
                    have pending.

                    Her dad is a devil worshipper.  He 
                    was molesting her as part of his 
                    satanic rituals.

      Lisbon and Van Pelt look at her poker-faced. 

                                  MARLA (CONT D)
                    I m kidding.  

      Lisbon stands, nods to Van Pelt and they start to go.

                    Last year, Chris was banging an 
                    older guy.  Like old.  She called 
                    him Pops.

                                  VAN PELT
                    No name?  Just Pops?

                                  MARLA
                    Pops.  That was it.  One time, she 
                    said he was getting weird, and she 
                    was talking about dumping him.  
                    But I don t know if she ever did.  
                    Like I say, we haven t been close 
                    for a while now.

      Lisbon and Van Pelt think they have a live lead.

                                  LISBON
                    That s interesting.  But it s not 
                    enough for a call to the D.A.  
                    Didn t she say anything else about 
                    him?  Anything at all?

      Lisbon tosses some PHOTOS on the table between them.  A WOMAN 
      with horrible bruises, stitched cuts on her face.

                    started the argument, when I hit

      Cho, Rigsby, Van Pelt working in the b.g. as Lisbon talks to 
      Damon Tanner.  Kids, Micah and Lisa, in tow.  Tanner is 
      agitated.  And drunk.

      He s loud.  The kids shrink back, but resignedly.  Used to 
      it.  Lisbon clocks it.  Her mouth tightens.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Tanner.  If we make an arrest, 
                    I will call you first, I promise. 

      Behind her, Rigsby leads Reeker, still cuffed, to a holding 
      tank.  Tanner sees them, pushes by Lisbon, belligerent --

                    Is this him?  Is this him?

                                  LISBON
                    Go home, Mr. Tanner.  Look after 
                    your children.

                    Go home!  Now! 

      Tanner busts into tears.  Lisbon stands and looks at him, 
      frozen.  Lisa, leading Micah, comes and takes her father s 
      hand.

                                  LISA

      Lisbon briefs Cho, Van Pelt, and Rigsby.  They re all looking 
      at her like kids at the quiet calm teacher that just screamed 
      for the first time.

                                  LISBON
                    Coroner just told me Christine was 
                    put into the water sometime early 
                    Wednesday morning.  So this Tuesday 
                    night party is critical.  Somebody 
                    who was there must know what 
                    happened later that night.


      Big place -- this school has money.  A memorial has just been 
      held for Christine Tanner.  A blown-up PHOTO of her sits on 
      the easel near the stage.  Stragglers are still leaving.  
      Dale, Win, Hope and Andy are seated together in the front 
      row.  The way Andy and Hope are casually entwined tell us 
      they are a couple.  Lisbon approaches.

                                  LISBON
                    Hi people.  

                                  DALE
                    Lady, we don t need a grief 
                      counsellor.

                                  HOPE
                    We know how to grieve.

                                  LISBON
                    Good.  I m not a grief counsellor.  
                    The principal didn t want to 
                    mention homicide detectives in 
                    front of other students.  I m Agent 
                    Lisbon, California Bureau of

      Jane appears.

                                  JANE
                    Hi guys.  I know Hope and Win.  
                    You must be Dale, and you re Andy. 

      The kids murmur in reply, a little alarmed.

                    animal you want, what would it be?  
                    Quick.

                    What? 

      The kids are confused and off balance now.  What s his game?  
      Jane keeps them off balance by abruptly changing the subject.

                                  JANE
                    When I spoke to you before, about 
                    Tuesday night at Devon Point, you 
                    didn t mention that you had a party 
                    after you went surfing.

                                  HOPE
                    Party?  It wasn t a party.

                                  JANE
                    The big deal is you were the last 
                    people, aside from her killer, to 
                    see Christine alive.  She was  
                    drowned later that night.

      The kids react with the shock expected of them.

      MINELLI and Lisbon walking and talking. 

                                    MINELLI
                    You brought him all the way back 
                    here why?

                                  LISBON
                    The local Chief begged me not to 
                    put him in his jail.  Merrick s a 
                    big cheese down there.  

                                    MINELLI
                    That is a signal, is that not a 
                    signal to cut the man loose?  

                                  LISBON
                    He hit Jane pretty good.  People 
                    were watching.  I had to arrest 
                    him.

                    This guy is connected.  This guy 
                    has Arnold s cellphone number.  You 
                    have zero evidence of any 
                      wrongdoing.  I know you re not so

                    I m not so dumb I can t see motive 
                    either, sir.  If Merrick was having 
                    sexual relations with Christine, 
                    that makes him suspect number one 
                    in her killing.  

                                    MINELLI
                    If.  It s a hunch.  Based on 
                      rockabilly.

                                  LISBON
                    It s a Jane hunch.  You keep him 
                    around for a reason.

                    Let us work Merrick until his 
                    lawyer arrives, maybe we ll get 
                    something more.

                                    MINELLI
                    Work him gently.  

      Minelli walks on.  Turns.

                    Bruised.  I ll tell him you asked.


      Merrick sits opposite Cho.  Both silent, gazing placidly at 
      each other.  Finally...

                                  CHO
                    Do you have a thing for youngsters 
                    in general, Dane?  Or was it 
                    Christine in particular that 
                    appealed to you?  That, I can 
                      understand.  Because you know, you  
                    meet some fifteen-year-olds, 
                    they re just as smart and mature

                    Maybe Christine was one of them.

      Morning.  Lisbon and Jane and Cho, near the big double doors, 
      sipping coffee and eating doughnuts.  Lisbon eyes her watch.

                    What do you think?  Did it work?

                    of them had walked in?

      Just then the doors open.  

      It s Hope.  She smiles diffidently at Jane and Lisbon, shy 
      and childlike in the unfamiliar surroundings.

                    I saw him clear as day.  Maybe it s

      Hope starts to tear up...



      Lisbon and Jane and Hope, seated.  Hope is a sobbing mess. 

                                  LISBON
                    Just tell us what happened.

                                  JANE
                    From the beginning.

      As she speaks, we see FLASHES from that night --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)              THE MENTALIST     "Red Tide"     PROD. DRAFT 7/29/08     46.

                                  HOPE
                      Flipper ed already left -- wasted 
                    as usual...

      FLASHBACK


                                  HOPE
                    He didn t mean to, it was an 
                    accident!  We couldn t help the 
                    guard, see.  But Dale we could.  So 
                    we promised not to tell.  All of 
                    us.  Except Chris.  Not Chris.

      FLASHBACK


      She swallows, it s hard to say --

                                  HOPE
                    Dale hit her.  We were all standing 
                    there and he just hit her on the 
                    head.  Then she was still moving, 
                    so he drug her to the ditch there 
                    and drowned her in it.  Held her 
                    under until she stopped moving.

                                  LISBON
                    And you and Win and Andy didn t say 
                    a word.  Two people murdered.

                                  HOPE
                    What if I was next?  I ve never 
                    seen Dale like that.  He was like a 
                    different person or something.

      Jane puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                  JANE
                    You re safe now.

      Van Pelt puts her head around the door, beckons...


      Dale stands, waiting.  Jane and Lisbon and Van Pelt join him.  

                                  DALE
                    I can t let my dad be punished for 
                    something he didn t do.  I know for 
                    a fact he had nothing to do with 
                    this. 

                                  JANE
                    We know it also.

                                  DALE
                    You do?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)              THE MENTALIST     "Red Tide"     PROD. DRAFT 7/29/08     48.
      CONTINUED:4040

                                  JANE
                    We know it was you that killed 
                    Christine and the guard.

                                  DALE
                    What?!  No!  That s not right.  Who 
                    told you that?  

                                  LISBON
                    Hope.

                                  DALE
                    No she didn t.  I don t believe 
                    you.  


      Dale looks stricken as Hope repeats her story in his 
      presence.  Lisbon and Jane between them.

                                  HOPE
                    I m sorry, Dale.  I had to tell the 
                    truth.  I had to.   

                                  DALE
                    How can you do this?  I knew you 
                    had a cold streak, but this...

                                  HOPE
                    Dale, don t.  You re only making it 
                    worse by continuing to lie.  You re 
                    only deceiving yourself. 

      Dale points at Hope.

                                  DALE
                    It was her.  It was her who killed 
                    Chris.  She was jealous of her ever 
                    since she started hanging out with 
                    us.  Used to be it was Hope was 
                    queen bee.  Then Chris arrives and 
                    we only hook up with Hope when, you 
                    know, Chris isn t available.

                                  HOPE
                    That s so distorted and not true.

                                  DALE
                    No.  I m telling the truth now...

      Dale mimes the action...

                                  DALE
                    Killed her. 

                                  HOPE
                          (angrily to Dale)
                    I did it for you jerk.  I did it 
                    for you.   
                          (turning to Jane and 
                            Lisbon)
                    She was screwing his father!  
                    And she s acting as judge over his 
                    life?  Telling him his life is 
                    over?  He s going to jail because 
                    she, she s got to show integrity, 
                    and morals?  She was a prissy self 
                    righteous hypocritical bitch and 
                    she was going to ruin his life.  

      Dale s like -  there you go, it was her. 

      Van Pelt appears at the door, beckons.  Off Lisbon s look of 
      bemused -  What now?  


      Win and Andy are waiting nervously.  Lisbon and Jane join 
      them.

                                  WIN
                    It was Flipper.

                                  LISBON
                    Really.

                                  ANDY
                    Yes it was.  Flipper.

                                  LISBON
                    It s strange you say that because 
                    we believe that it was Dale killed 
                    the guard, and Hope who then hit 
                    Chris in the head with a shovel, to 
                    stop her from calling the police.

                                  ANDY
                          (amazed)
                    How did you know that?

                                  JANE
                    She s psychic.

                                  WIN
                    Dale must have told them, you dope.
                          (sees ray of hope)
                    But that s what happened alright.  
                    Me and Andy were like, whoa!  But 
                    what could we do?

                                  ANDY
                    These are our friends.  
                    We couldn t tell.

                                  JANE
                    I don t think so.

                                  WIN
                    You don t think what?

                                  LISBON 
                    Walk this way.

      Lisbon ushers them toward the interrogation room.


      Jane and Lisbon usher in Win and Andy, whose faces fall on 
      seeing Hope and Dale; now seated glumly alongside each other.  

                                  JANE
                    You two couldn t tell because you 
                    were part of it.  All four of you 
                    killed Christine.

      Jane continues, Lisbon and the four kids listen...

                                  JANE
                    And now you re all equally under 
                    arrest.

      Off the four teenagers...


      FLASHBULBS OF PHOTOGRAPHERS AND NEWS TV CREW LIGHTS flare on 
      the other side of double doors as Rigsby leads in Dane 
      Merrick, shaken, in handcuffs.  Watching are -- Lisbon and 
      Damon Tanner, his two kids in BG.  

                                  TANNER
                    Statutory rape?  What ll he get?

                                  LISBON
                    He won t do time.  Tough to prove 
                    him guilty in a court of law.  But 
                    we ll have fun trying.    

      Tanner nods.  Their attention turns to his kids.  

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    You have good kids.

                                  TANNER
                    Yes.

                                  LISBON
                    You are all they have.

                                  LISBON
                    So be good to them.

                    I am good to them.

      A defensive tone.  Don t get personal.  Tanner starts to walk 
      away and Lisbon is about to let him.   But then she goes 
      after him.

                                  LISBON
                    Mister Tanner.
                          (he pauses)
                    My father was a good man, like you 
                    are, and after my mom died, he was 
                      a helpless drunk like you are.  
                    Killed himself and damn near killed 
                    me and my brothers, too.

      She hands him a card. 

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Get some help.  Your children 
                    deserve it.  And so do you.

      She walks out.  On Tanner and his kids and the office 
      bustle...

                                                                          FADE OUT.
