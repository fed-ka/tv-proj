      CHEERFUL ROCK MUSIC emits from the brightly lit bar. Its sign announces 
      "OPEN 24 HOURS" and "COCKTAILS." An enormous STUFFED GRIZZLY BEAR stands 
      on the porch. 


      Trucker #1 staggers through the door. He gives the bear an affable pat 
      on the head. 

                                      TRUCKER #1 
                        Howdy, buddy. 

      He moves down the stairs, glancing this way and that for a secluded 
      spot. Finding a dark corner behind a truck, he unzips his fly and goes 
      about his business. 

      Suddenly, from out of the darkness, there is a LOUD THUMP, followed by a 
      SCREAM. More LOUD THUMPS accompany escalating SCREAMS. Trucker #1 zips 
      up and moves around the truck to a green big rig parked around the back, 
      behind the pumps. The THUMPS and SCREAMS stop. 

                                      TRUCKER #1 
                        Uh, hello? Hello in there? 
                                (beat) 
                        Hello? 

      There is no response. He waits a beat, then heads back to the bar, and 
      we follow him back to the door. 

 1       In silence, the CAMERA MOVES IN on the rig to a few feet from the door, 
      and then stops. All is still for a beat, then  

      With a loud CRASH, the PASSENGER DOOR comes FLYING into the CAMERA.

      FADE IN: 


      TRUCKER #2 makes his way across the parking lot. Spotting something, he 
      stops in his tracks. REVEAL FOUR DEER gathered around the big green rig. 
      Trucker #2 smiles at the lovely image, then his expression darkens. 
      REVEAL the deer as they disappear one by one. Off the Trucker's 
      perplexed expression. 


      The POLICE CRUISER drives along. 


      The SIRENS SOUND as the cruiser pulls into the parking lot. A small 
      crowd has gathered. Dwight and Reed get out of the car and approach 
      Trucker #2. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        I'm Detective Faraday. This is Officer 
                        Reed. 

                                      TRUCKER #2 
                        I'm glad you came. We been waitin' all 
                        morning. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Right. 
                                (beat) 
                        Where is it? 


 5                                       TRUCKER #2 
                        Where's what? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        The& 

      He looks quizzically at Reed. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        The thing? 

                                      TRUCKER #2 
                        Sure. Right. Come on. 

      Trucker #2 leads Dwight and Reed over to the rig. He points to the 
      passenger door, which has been reattached. Dwight reaches out to open 
      it, but at the mere touch of his fingers it falls off and CLATTERS to 
      the ground. The men jump back in surprise. Trucker #2 watches as Dwight 
      and Reed crouch down beside it. 

                                      REED 
                        Someone kicked the door in, or some 
                        kind of device. Maybe a car crash, or-- 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (interrupts) 
                        No, I don't think so. It looks like 
                        somebody broke the door off from the 
                        inside, then picked it up and tried to 
                        put it back on, you know? 

                                      REED 
                        What the hell could do that? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I don't know. 

                                      TRUCKER #2 
                        Look, the door ain't the problem. The 
                        problem's inside. Here, look for 
                        yourself. I'll go around. 

      Trucker #2 moves around the truck while Dwight steps up to the cab. He 
      looks to Reed. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Come on. 

      Reed raises his eyebrows. Dwight gets it. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Fine. 





      More squad cars are on the scene. The area around the truck has been 
      marked off with police tape. 


      Dwight storms out. Reed meets up with him. 

                                      REED 
                      I just got a call from the station. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I know, I know. We're off the case. 

                                      REED 
                        Yeah. They want me back patrolling 
                        Greenwood and you on an animal attack. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (interested) 
                        What is it? 

                                      REED 
                        Some old man's pet monkey bit some old 
                        lady's dog, and now there's a royal 
                        rumble goin' down. 

      They start towards the car. 

                                      REED (CONT'D) 
                        They want you back at the station. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Wonderful. 


      BIRD'S EYE POV of a thick forest. 


      TIME LAPSE as CLOUDS roll along. 


      TIME LAPSE on the CLOUDS as day turns to NIGHT. BOLTS OF LIGHTENING 
      FLASH. A PAINTING OF A NATIVE AMERICAN WOMAN appears in the dark sky. It 
      dissolves to a PAINTING OF A DEER. 



      Henry and the Blonde laugh and dance in the parking lot. They kiss and 
      giggle as he leads her across the lot to his rig. 

                                      HENRY 
                        Oh, it's right here. 

      He points to the decal of a shapely woman on the door. 

                                      HENRY (CONT'D) 
                        See this little lady right here? 

      The Blonde giggles. He opens the door. 

                                      HENRY (CONT'D) 
                        After you. 

      She climbs into the cab. He sighs and follows. 


      Henry and the Blonde, who now wears modest blouse and has her hair in 
      pigtails, giggle and kiss as they walk to the truck. There is a CRACKLE 
      in the bushes. They stop. 

                                      BLONDE 
                        Did you hear something? 

      He glances around. There is nothing but silence. He widens his eyes and 
      leans in close to her ear. 

                                      HENRY 
                        No. 

      They both LAUGH as they continue towards the truck. There is another 
      CRACKLE. The Blonde stops. 

                                      BLONDE 
                        No, wait. I definitely heard something. 

      They both glance around. 

                                      HENRY 
                        No, you didn't. Come on, come on. 
                                (slaps her behind) 
                        Let's get in the truck. 

      He opens the door. 


 23                                       HENRY (CONT'D) 
                        There you go. Okay. 

      She climbs inside. He glances around. 


      POV through the passenger window as the Blonde and Henry slowly rise 
      into view, their eyes wide with horror. DRAMATIC ORCHESTRA MUSIC RISES 
      as we CUT TO  

    A sweet-looking DOE standing beneath the rig. She blinks once, then 
      twice. The horrified couple SCREAMS. 


      Henry and the Blonde LAUGH. This time, she is in a skin-
      tight pink T-shirt. 

                                      HENRY 
                        Come here. 

      He pulls her close and they kiss deeply. They LAUGH as they continue 
      towards the rig. Suddenly, there is a CRACKLE in the bushes. They stop. 

                                      HENRY 
                        Ooh, hey. 
                                (beat) 
                        Did you hear something? 

                                      BLONDE 
                        No. Let's go. 

      She turns to him and GIGGLES. They continue along. 



 24                                       HENRY 
                        Okay. 

      They stop at the truck. Henry spots something. 

                                      HENRY 
                        Hey. 

                                      BLONDE 
                        What? 

                                      HENRY 
                      I didn't leave the door unlocked. 

      He gingerly steps towards the door and opens it. He climbs inside. She 
      follows. 


      CLOSE ON the Deer Monster's "hoof" as it CLOPS down on the truck door. 


      The Deer Monster carries the Blonde, Creature from the Black Lagoon-
      style. She kicks and SCREAMS. The Monster glances around, then CLOPS 
      towards the forest. The Blonde passes out. 


      The Monster hastily replaces the truck door, then STOMPS off into the 
      night. 



      The Deer Woman approaches. She glances over her shoulder, then proceeds 
      inside. 



      The street is busy and neon-lit. One cruiser is already parked outside 
      the shop, where a CROWD has gathered. A second cruiser pulls up. Dwight 
      and Reed get out. They look to the storefront. A SPLATTING SOUND causes 
      them both to look down. REVEAL DROPS OF BLOOD plopping onto Reed's shoe. 

                                      REED 
                        What the fuck? 

      They both look up. REVEAL a HUMAN ARM, still in its bloody sleeve, 
      dangling over the roof ledge. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        At least we found the arm. 
                              (shouts) 
                        Oh, boys! 

    A COP appears at the ledge. He looks down at Dwight and Reed. 


    A nearby wall is smeared with BLOOD. A UNIFORM picks up the butchered 
      arm and slips it into an evidence bag. Patterson stands over by the 
      ledge. He spots Dwight and Reed. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Faraday, what the hell are you doing 
                        here? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Just looking around. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        What, are you just wandering from crime 
                        scene to crime scene these days? 

      PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures. 

                                      REED 
                        Hey calm down, man. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Calm down? He just ambles in here and 
                        I'm supposed to&come to think of it, 
                        who the hell are you? 

      Dwight spots something. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Excuse me. 

      Dwight moves towards the ledge. Reed approaches Patterson. 

 33                                       REED 
                        I'm Officer Reed. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Reed? Didn't I see your name on the 
                        street beat? What are you doing 
                        loitering around my crime  

      Dwight crouches by a smudge of blood. He sets his pen beside it to 
      measure. 

                                      REED (O/S) 
                                (interrupts) 
                        Detective Faraday has just as much of a 
                        right to be here as you. He had the 
                        first one of these...these things. 

      He spots another smudge a few paces away. Patterson and Reed stand face-
      to-face as they argue. 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Murders. 

                                      REED 
                        Have you seen the bodies? You think a 
                        human did that? 

                                        PATTERSON 
                        Well, what would you prefer me to 
                        think? You think-- 

      He cuts himself off as he notices Dwight, who is leaping across the roof 
      like an animal. 

                                        PATTERSON (CONT'D) 
                        Faraday, what the fuck are you doing? 
                        Get off of my roof! 


      The area is taped off. Fuches stands with a UNIFORM. Reed and Dwight 
      move along. Fuches calls out from inside. 

                                      FUCHES (O/S) 
                        Goodnight, ladies. Drive safely! 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Shut up, Fuches. 

      Fuches grins. Reed and Dwight move up to the cruiser. 

                                      REED 
                      I can drop you home before I turn the 
                        car in. 


 34                                       DWIGHT 
                        No. No, thanks. I live about a mile 
                        from here. You know, I'll walk. 

                                      REED 
                        You sure? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        It'll do me good, clear my head. 

                                      REED 
                        Okay. Get some sleep. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        You too. 

      Reed goes to the car. Dwight starts down the sidewalk. 


      Dwight moves along a quiet street. He passes a LARGE NATIVE AMERICAN 
      MURAL. He rounds a corner and picks up the pace a bit. Behind him, there 
      is a faint CLOPPING sound, like horse or deer hooves on cement. He stops 
      and turns. After a beat, he continues. There is another CLOP-CLOP. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        No, no. I'm definitely losing it. 

      He continues at a brisker pace, glancing over his shoulder every so 
      often. There is more faint CLOPPING. He hurries along. Suddenly, there 
      is a LOUD SCREAM. A THUG leaps out of the darkness and grabs Dwight by 
      the neck. He wields a knife. 

                                      THUG 
                              (shouts) 
                        Give me your wallet, asshole, and I 
                        won't cut you! 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (calm) 
                        Okay, okay, okay. 

      Dwight suddenly wrests free. He spins around and kicks the Thug in the 
      crotch. The Thug SCREAMS, drops the knife and collapses to the ground. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        You motherfucker! You almost gave me a 
                        goddamned heart attack. 

      Dwight pulls his gun. 

                                      THUG 
                        Please, mister, don't shoot me! 



 35                                       DWIGHT 
                        Don't shoot you? Don't you know better 
                        than to mug a policeman? 

                                      THUG 
                        You don't look like a cop. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        You know, I was going to call back up 
                        and have you booked, but you know what? 

                                      THUG 
                        What? 

      Dwight plunges the knife into the Thug's arm. The Thug SCREAMS. 

                                      THUG (CONT'D) 
                        You fucking stabbed me! 

                                      DWIGHT 
                              (shouts) 
                        Don't pull it out. There's a hospital 
                        about four blocks from here. Have the 
                        doctors remove it, and when that arm 
                        heals up, get a job and stay off the 
                        goddamned street. 

      He withdraws the gun and moves off, leaving the Thug to writhe in pain. 

                                      THUG 
                              (to himself) 
                        What the fuck was that? 


      REVEAL the Deer Woman standing nearby, her eyes wide as she looks on. 
      She slips into the darkness. 


      Dwight and Reed head through the parking lot, both silent and grim. 

                                      REED 
                        I'm going home, showering, changing and 
                        getting completely drunk. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        What's the matter? This case getting to 
                        you? 

                                      REED 
                        Look, every legend is based in fact, so 
                        maybe-- 

                                      DWIGHT 
                                (interrupts) 
                        Every legend is not based in fact. 

                                      REED 
                        If you take that attitude we're never 
                        going to get anywhere. 
                                (looks at his watch) 
                        Look, I get off soon. I'm thinking 
                        about coming back, maybe hitting the 
                        slots. You want to to come? A little 
                        drinking, a little gambling? 

                                      DWIGHT 
                      I don't gamble. 

                                      REED 
                        Did you see how they were paying off in 
                        there? 



 48                                       DWIGHT 
                              (laughs) 
                        You saw one person win, so now you're 
                        going to come back and play, thinking 
                        that you're going to win like the one 
                        person you saw win out of the hundreds 
                        of people that are in there? 

                                      REED 
                              (grins) 
                        That's correct. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        It's people like you that make America 
                        great. 

                                      REED 
                              (laughs) 
                        Wanna bet? 

      They head off. As they go, they pass a STATUE OF A NATIVE AMERICAN. 
      CLOSE ON its menacing face. 


      The cruiser barrels down the street, SIRENS BLARING. 


      The cruiser continues along. Suddenly, a deer leaps out. It stands 
      there, its eyes alight as the cruiser SQUEALS to a halt just inches from 
      it. 


      The cruiser zigzags through the street. 


      The cruiser barrels along. 


      Dwight's car pulls up. He rushes out, leaving the door open. He charges 
      up the stairs. 


      The Deer Woman leaps over the balcony and lands gracefully on the 
      ground. She rushes off. Dwight appears on the balcony. He heads down the 
      stairs. 


      Dwight rushes to his car. He gets in and drives off. 


      The Deer Woman runs through the darkness towards the woods. 


      The cruiser pulls up behind the Deer Woman. It swerves in front of her, 
      cutting her off. Dwight gets out and pulls his gun. 

 57                                       DWIGHT 
                        Police! Police! Don t you move! 

      She stands there motionless for a long beat. Then she kicks the side of 
      the car and it spins off, knocking Dwight to the ground. She runs off. 

                                      DWIGHT (CONT'D) 
                        Jesus Christ! 

      He picks himself up and limps to the car. 


      The Deer Woman's reflection appears in a stream. She cups a handful of 
      water and drinks. SEVERAL GUNSHOTS are fired in the distance. She 
      hurries away. 


      Dwight's car drives along. 


      The Deer Woman stands by a tree. Her eyes FLASH YELLOW in Dwight's 
      headlights. Dwight speeds towards her. She is motionless. The car 
      barrels up and SMASHES her full-force against the tree. 

      There's a moment of silence, and then Dwight crawls out of the car. 
      Blood streams from his forehead as he straightens. 

      Suddenly, the car lifts from the ground. REVEAL the Deer Woman, her eyes 
      ablaze and her mouth filled with blood, as she holds up the car. Dwight 
      unleashes a stream of RAPID GUNFIRE. QUICK CUTS as the Deer Woman's head 
      jerks back and forth. Dwight FIRES his last bullet. The car drops to the 
      ground. 

      Dwight catches his breath. He leans against the car, then slumps to the 
      ground. POLICE CRUISERS pull up, their SIRENS BLARING. 

                                      DWIGHT 
                        Animal attacks. 

      He LAUGHS. The cruisers pull up. SEVERAL OFFICERS get out and rush 
      towards him. 

      FADE OUT: THE END
