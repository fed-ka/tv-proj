POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...
The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
his body. His left holds a GUN!
Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.
ONLY SEE THE
DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.
A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
camera...
KAREN CROSS
... Police on scene are approaching
the suspect. They're at the center of
the Bridge now.
The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.
The
Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!

Who am I speaking with?

No questions. It's time to set the

without my say and I will execute every
last man, woman and child in here if my
needs are not met. Do not test me.

Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair

Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him.
CONNERS
Teddy, Vincent...

... Nice to see you both.
JENKINS
Conners has been reinstated to full
active duty. It's his scene.
This info comes as a surprise.
Especially to Callo.
CALLO
The last hostage situation this guy
headed, an innocent civilian died.
CONNERS
I was not responsible...
CALLO
You never are. That girl would be
alive today if it weren't for your
cowboy antics. You destroy lives.
CONNERS
Fuck you. Look who's talking about
destroying lives.
JENKINS
Decision's been made, Bernie.
CALLO
I was first on scene and I have seniority.

Don't do this, Martin.
JENKINS
We'll talk about it later.

JENKINS
Anything questionable happens today,

DEKKER

Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins.

You can call me Lorenz.
Dekker writes, "Lorenz."
CONNERS
Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there?
Can we get you anything? Food, medical
supplies. We heard an explosion.
LORENZ
Everyone who matters is fine. Of course,
I would've preferred not having the
authorities involved at all. We weren't
planning to be here this long. But, since
Seattle's finest needs a presence on the

My fame proceeds me.
LORENZ
Don't be flattered. I needed someone
who's been through the experience
before. Hopefully this time it will go
better for all involved. I plan on
living a full, long and rich life. I
didn't, however, expect them to find
you so quickly. I thought you were
suspended.
Dekker writes, "In The Know," on his pad.
CONNERS
I was, but I'm back.
You're

LORENZ
You never get what you pay for.
(back to business)
You want to know about the hostages?
How many and are they okay?
Dekker scribbles, "Pro".
CONNERS
Yes.
LORENZ
Approximately forty, they're fine,
considering. All except one. We had a
situation.
CONNERS
Someone's dead?
LORENZ
Theory... put to practice isn't always
perfect. Can't expect to keep the
hostages in check if a bad deed goes
unpunished or they may... randomly
decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
order to it.
(Conners drifts in thought)
Detective? Are you still with me?
Teddy SNAPS her fingers. That gets Conners attention.
There's a new intensity to his demeanor.
CONNERS
What else will I be looking for?

I'll contact you

LORENZ
Don't worry, I have no plans until
sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's

CONNERS

Nothing about today makes sense.
Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the
Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police

You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me

DEKKER
There's never been a single case in

DEKKER (cont'd)
that means to a twelve year old?
(beat)
Because he died on the job, he's a
hero? Never made sense to me.
CONNERS
So why become a cop?
DEKKER
Finish what he started. Every day he
went out, trying to do some good. Help
the people who couldn't help
themselves, just give'em a chance is
what he always said. Didn't always
work out right, but he tried. You
tried to help save that girl on the
bridge. If you weren't there, the girl
still would've died. She had a chance
because you were there. That's all we

Several NEWS TRUCKS have arrived, always after the story.
A CORONER, 40's, zips shut a body bag. Inside the BADLY
BURNT BODY of Detective Conners. The BADGE ON HIS BELT still
visible. They load him into the truck.

Fireman walks behind them, back towards the fire truck.
JENKINS huddles with a group of Detectives.

It's because he wasn't only a better

That's when DEKKER grabs the camera, PUSHES it out of her
face.
KAREN CROSS
We just wanted a statement.
DEKKER
Shame on you.
KAREN CROSS
This is more than just news for us.
American National's CFO sits on the
Board of Channel Two. They have a
vested interest in what's going on.
DEKKER
Find another source.
Karen and her Cameraman leave Teddy and Dekker alone.
TEDDY
Conners was right. We should've never
gone in. How many more mistakes can we
make in one day? He was eliminating
his accomplices. We thought he was
going to show up? We didn't even think
he could do this... How dumb are we?

Good evening Detective. I just wanted
to compliment you on a fine day. You
were an unexpected adversary that was
most challenging.
DEKKER
It's not over yet.
LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
Wishful thinking.
DEKKER
No. My wish is to catch you. You're a
murderer. A cop killer at that.
LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve
it. Callo was insignificant and
Conners crossed me. In years to come
you'll thank me for getting rid of him
before he corrupted you.
DEKKER
I know about the money. You steal a
billion dollars... They will find you.
LORENZ/ CURTIS (VO)
A risk I'm willing to take. It's
almost sunrise. Fare thee well.
Lorenz hangs up. Dekker surprisingly calm, hangs up the

FBI's got a team of 40 computer

Dekker peers around the corner... York's gone.
YORK (OS)
But I'll give you credit... You turned
out to be quite the little thorn,
didn't you?
Dekker speed-walks, continuing the search.
YORK (OS)
I think Conners would be sorry that you
died. But not me.
Dekker stops, eyes a full 360. The containers all look
alike. Dekker wonders if he's just going around in circles.
Until...
BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS RICOCHET ALL AROUND DEKKER!
He
dive-rolls for cover as...
ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK!

A narrow wooden dock. There's a few small boats, A TUG BOAT

EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane.

From on top of the TUG BOAT!
Dekker turns just as...
York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker.
As Dekker
struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES!

BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground
beneath the water.
Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.
He
falls to the planks.
York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he
wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM.
Dekker struggles to breathe.
York SQUEEZES harder.
YORK
I have come this far...

Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind
York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two!
Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.
York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.
Still choking.
Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!
York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!
He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...
... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!
The Pike punches through his
chest... POPS out his back!
