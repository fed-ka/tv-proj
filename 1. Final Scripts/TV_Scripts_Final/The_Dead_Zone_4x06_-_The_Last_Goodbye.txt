                                              TEASER

          FADE IN:

  11INT. HALLWAY - SMALL NIGHT CLUB (PORTLAND, MAINE) - NIGHT

          A dark hallway.  We PUSH IN on a closed door.

          We hear giggling from the other side.  The door POPS open. 
          It's Sarah, laughing.  Walt's covering her eyes, Johnny's
          leading them.

                                        SARAH
                        Where are we?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The whole point of a surprise is
                        for me not to have to answer
                        questions.

          The sound of MUFFLED CONVERSATION gets closer.

                                        SARAH
                        Walt, a little help here?

                                        WALT
                        I'm just along for the ride...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Trust me.  This'll be worth it.

          Johnny leads us towards another door.  Opens it --


  22INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB (PORTLAND, MAINE) - NIGHT

          A cacophony of voices in small venue STUFFED with people. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, you can look now. 

          Walt removes his hands.  Sarah looks around.

                                        SARAH
                        You brought me to 'open mike'
                        night?

          The LIGHTS dim.  The audience STIRS.  Johnny points to a
          lit playbill that reads:

          "LIVE: DARREN FOLDES"



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - TEASER - 2/10/05 - YELLOW  2.


    2CONTINUED:2

                                        SARAH
                        Oh my God.  OH MY GOD.

                                        WALT
                        Who the heck is Derek Foldes?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darren Foldes.  Son of the greatest
                          singer-songwriter of our
                          generation.
                                (off Walt's look)
                        Roy Foldes?

                                        SARAH
                        I told you about him, the tour I
                          followed when I was 17.

          Spotlights PIERCE the darkness and light up the stage. 
          People CLAP and CHEER.  They yell over the noise.

                                        WALT
                                (remembering)
                        Roy Foldes!  Didn't that guy drive
                        his car off a cliff?

          Lights WHIRL as DARREN FOLDES (27) takes the stage.  He's
          young, good-looking, intense.

                                        DARREN
                        This is a song you might know...
                        it was written by my father and
                        it's called, "I'll Remember."

          He cracks a powerful CHORD on his guitar and starts into
          what will be his (and Roy's) SIGNATURE SONG.  Sarah is
          all smiles as the crowd ERUPTS as the music continues...


  33INT. HALLWAY, SMALL NIGHTCLUB (PORTLAND) - NIGHT - LATER

          Sarah, Johnny and Walt hanging out after the show.  Walt
          bangs on the side of his head.

                                        WALT
                        DO YOU GUYS HEAR A SIREN?  I HEAR
                          A SIREN?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have fun?

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah, it was cool.  There was
                          something a little sad about it,
                        though. 


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - TEASER - 2/10/05 - YELLOW  3.


    3CONTINUED:3

          Darren walks towards them, carrying his guitar (no case). 
          He seems a little unsteady.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, we really enjoyed the show.

                                        SARAH
                        You were great.  Really.

                                        WALT
                        Loud!

                                        DARREN
                        Thanks for comin' out.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        You got another gig in the area?

                                        DARREN
                        I'm in Philly day after tomorrow. 
                        If they've sold any tickets. 

          Darren takes a long swig from a silver flask.  Johnny and
          Sarah share a concerned look.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, is that your dad's Fender?

                                        DARREN
                        One and only.  Bought it off some
                        guy on eBay. 

                                        SARAH
                        You weren't close?

                                        DARREN
                                (amused and drunk)
                        I never met the guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Would you mind if I...?

                                        DARREN
                        Knock yourself out.

          Darren offers the guitar to Johnny, who handles it
          carefully:

                                        JOHNNY
                        All the songs written on this
                        guitar.

          WHOOSH!            DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - TEASER - 2/10/05 - YELLOW  4.


  44INT. CONCERT VENUE (ANYWHERE) - CIRCA 1987 - NIGHT -
          VISION

          FLASH TO WHITE! 

          Johnny's eyes re-adjust to the SPOTLIGHT.  He stands on a
          stage.  Next to him is (YOUNGER) ROY FOLDES, 27, in the
          middle of an intense GUITAR SOLO.  In a grand finish, Roy
          raises his guitar over his head and we - FLASH!  


  55INT. PAWN SHOP (LONG ISLAND, NY) - DAY - VISION

          The SAME GUITAR is placed on a glass countertop.  A MAN
          we cannot see.  Johnny stands behind him.  A scraggly, 20-
            something CLERK.  He snaps the case open as we see the
          pristine Fender guitar.

                                        CLERK
                        I'll give ya a hundred bucks. 

                                        MAN (O.S.)
                        This thing used to belong to that
                        dead rock star, Roy Foldes.

                                        CLERK
                        How old d'you think I am?  One
                        fifty, plus the case.

                                        MAN (O.S.)
                        What the hell, I don't need it
                          anymore. 

          Johnny looks up in the mirror, and sees Roy Foldes.  Older,
          45ish, thick beard, but it's definitely him.


  66RESUME - INT. HALLWAY, SMALL NIGHTCLUB (PORTLAND) - NIGHT

          Johnny whirls out of the vision.

                                        DARREN
                        Hey, man, you okay?

          Off Johnny, as he looks into Darren's eyes...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  77EXT. CITY STREET (PORTLAND AREA) - NIGHT

          Johnny behind the wheel, excited.  Walt sits in the back
          seat, Sarah shotgun.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I swear to God, I saw him!  I saw
                        Roy Foldes.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, he died 18 years ago. 
                        His car dropped 100 feet into the
                        ocean.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They never found his body.

                                        SARAH
                        That's true.

                                        WALT
                        Let's assume this guy is still
                        alive, why do something like that? 
                        Why not just quit?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's a good question, maybe
                        I'll ask Roy when I find him.

                                        SARAH

                        Made me think about things, old
                          feelings.

                        You mean Johnny?

                                        SARAH
                        No.  Well, yeah, Johnny was part
                        of it, but it's not what you think. 
                        The music inspired me... gave me
                        the strength I needed at a
                          difficult time in my life.

          Walt can see how much this all means to her.

                                        WALT
                        Then you should go with him.

          Sarah is caught off guard...

                        You know what I mean.

                        I never thought I'd ever get
                          married.  It just wasn't on the
                        radar.  I'd seen too many broken
                          relationships, people tearing
                        each other to pieces in the name
                        of love.  Then I met you and
                        everything changed.  I'd finally
                        met someone I could trust and who
                        could trust me.  No matter what. 
                        So, if you want to go look for
                        this guy, I'm all for it.

  99EXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE (NEW YORK CITY) - DAY

          A rock riff, one of Roy Foldes' tracks plays, "Messin'

          Johnny's SUV cruises towards Manhattan.

          Sarah has her high top tennis shoes propped up on the
          dash.  There's an energy about them, as if they were
          reaching back into their own lives.  Johnny sips from a
          take-out cup.

          Johnny glances over at Sarah, but a doe-eyed, teenage
          Sarah stares back at him.

                          Meeting him changed my life...

          A lucid vision.  Half of Johnny's SUV is normal, the other
          half is TEENAGE SARAH sitting in the front seat (NYC
            outside).  Feet sticking out the window.  An acoustic
          guitar by her side...

                                        TEENAGE SARAH

                        Lacey Rolfey and I snuck around
                        behind the theater to see if we
                        could talk our way in.  I turned
                        around and Roy was standing right
                        behind me.  He took one look at
                        me and said "Little girl, you got
                        the music in you."  It was --
                          magical.  Like he could see a
                        part of me that nobody else could
                        see.

                        But when I hear there's a psychic
                        sitting in the lobby with
                          information about a rock star

                        Look, I have no reason to lie
                        about this.  I figured since you
                        and Roy were friends, that maybe
                        you'd be interested to know he

                        star... a self-centered pain in
                        the ass.  He was also gifted. 
                        I'd put him right up there with

                        Let me explain something to you.

                        'Crystal'.  It seemed personal.

                        I like to think of myself as a

  2424INT. AN UNDERGROUND BAR (PHILADELPHIA) - NIGHT

          A small crowd.  Johnny and Sarah are here.  Darren is on
          stage.  He adjusts the strings on his Fender Strat.  He's
          slightly drunk and unsteady.

                                        DARREN
                        This last song is an original
                        tune.

          Darren breaks into the song, which is surprisingly soft*
          and beautiful.  A DRUNK GUY yells:

                                        DRUNK
                        Play "I'll Remember"!

          Darren continues to play, trying to ignore this
            loudmouth...

                                        DRUNK
                        This is a bunch'a crap!

          The disappointment in Darren's face is not lost on Johnny
          and Sara, as he stops playing.

                                        DARREN
                        Look, I already played that song. 
                        So why don't you shut up and let
                        me finish?

                                        DRUNK
                        Why don't you jump off a cliff
                        like your dead old man!

                                        DARREN
                        Gee, that's original.

          Darren hesitates, then drops his guitar and leaps into
          the crowd as a huge fight begins...


  2525INT. THE UNDERGROUND BAR (PHILADELPHIA) - LATER

          Johnny and Sarah approach the crowded bar.

                        Grab a table.  I'm gonna find a
                          bathroom.

          Johnny walks away, as Sarah looks around and suddenly
          notices Darren at the end of the bar.  He's by himself
          drinking a beer.  Sarah decides to approach him.

          He looks around...

                        We met after your show the other

          Darren tries to place her, then...

                                        DARREN
                        Oh yeah.

                                        SARAH
                        I can't believe how some people
                        act.  Are you okay?

          Darren swigs from a bottle of beer.

                                        DARREN
                        Right as rain.  How 'bout that
                        guy in the front?  Big dude.  He
                        didn't look quite so large from
                        the stage.

                                        SARAH
                        I would've liked to have heard
                        that original song.

                                        DARREN
                        That makes you a majority of one.

          Darren takes another look at Sarah, she's cute.  He
            scribbles something on a cocktail napkin and hands it to
          her.

                                        SARAH

                        dad was a real ladies man.  So I
                        hear. 

                                        SARAH
                        You never met him? 

                                        DARREN
                          I didn't even know he was my father
                        'til a few years ago.  My mom got
                        sick.  Guess she thought I should
                        know where I came from.  That was
                        nice of her, don't you think?

          Sarah can see his pain.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sure he's proud of you --
                          wherever he is.

          Darren's demeanor suddenly shifts, like he's been kicked
          in the stomach.  He looks at her hard...

                                        DARREN
                        What's that suppose t'mean?

                                        SARAH
                        I just meant...

                                        DARREN
                        What is it you people?  I mean, I
                        understand not being able to let
                        go of the music, but can't you
                        let the poor sucker rest in peace?

          Darren grabs his jacket and guitar case.

                                        DARREN
                        Oh, but if you do see my old man,
                        tell him I said thanks for nothin'. 

          Darren walks off passing Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What was that all about?

          Off Sarah's bothered look...

                        There's something sad about him. 
                        That's probably why he drinks so
                        much.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It must be tough to live your

                        Ready to start working together

                        There is no story.

                        Then why are you shadowing the
                        kid?  It can't be his music.

          Sarah TURNS...

                                        SARAH
                                (flares)

                        so.

                        I'm entitled to my opinion.

          Johnny glances at him in the rear view.  Sarah holds the

                                        JOHNNY
                        You really gave it to that guy

                          Darren's cellphone number.

          She sticks the napkin in the glove box and closes it.

                                        SARAH
                        I been thinking... If Roy's really
                        out there then maybe he's in touch
                        with somebody from his past.

          Sarah thinks and then picks up a CD case and studies it.

                        How far is it to Rockland County?


  2929INT. NEPTOON RECORDS STORE (ROCKLAND COUNTY, NY) - DAY

          An indie record store FILLED with vinyl albums and vintage
          rock posters.  Johnny and Sarah ENTER.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How did you know about this place?

                        It was mentioned on a Roy Foldes
                        tribute CD.  It said that Roy's
                        writing partner, Stephen Vickings,
                        retired and opened a vintage record
                        shop.

                                        VICKINGS (O.S.)
                        We don't have any gangsta rap
                          records, if that's what you're
                        lookin' for?

          STEPHEN VICKINGS, 40s, spins towards them - smiling at
          his own joke.  He manuvers a racing style wheelchair.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We were wondering if you have any
                        Roy Foldes albums?

                                        VICKINGS
                        Albums?  Lemme guess, refugees
                        from the "Totally 80's"?

                        At least I cut my mullet.

                                        SARAH
                        We're big fans of yours, Mr.
                          Vickings.

                                        VICKINGS
                        Mr. Vickings is married to my
                        mother.  Stephen'll do fine. 

          Stephen wheels down the aisle.  Johnny and Sarah follow.

                        Like brothers.  I miss his energy. 
                        His passion.  But mostly I miss

          He slides a worn, folded sheet of yellow notebook paper

          As Roy steps out onto the sidewalk - Johnny is already
          there.  WHAM.  Roy gets NAILED by a GIRL holding a big
          box of sandwiches.  Delivery food spills everywhere.

          The girl turns around, she's stunning.  She doesn't

                        Here, lemme help you with that.

          They pick up the wrapped sandwiches, as Roy sets them
          back in the box and looks directly into her eyes.

          Johnny and Sarah stand in the middle of a JUNKYARD.  Heaps
          of cars and wreckage bleed with rust and broken glass.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's hard to believe anything
                          beautiful ever happened here.

                                        SARAH
                        This all used to be green grass,
                        the stage sat right over there. 
                                  (remembers)
                        We were standing right over here!

          Excited, Sarah grabs Johnny's arm and PULLS him towards
          the other side of the hill...

          CONCERT - VISION - CONTINUOUS 

          As Teenage Sarah speaks, she gives Johnny a "tour,"
          pointing to different areas in the junkyard, excited.

                        There was a huge parking lot filled
                        with arts and crafts...
                              (a beat)
                        Camp grounds over here.
                              (a beat)
                        I was standing against the fence
                        trying to get a glimpse of the
                        band... Follow me.

          A few things happen:

          The chain link fence becomes whole.  The scrap metal
            VANISHES.  The ground is suddenly covered with green grass. 

          The cold evening becomes a sunny afternoon.  PEOPLE fill
          the fields - the parking lot - the camping area.  

          Teenage Sarah is PRESSED up against the fence on the other
          side.  Her friend is beside her.

          Roy holds AUBREY'S hand, (the delivery girl) as they WALK
          past Johnny towards the backstage area.  As they approach
          the stage steps, Johnny is already there beside them.

                                        AUBREY
                        Are we allowed back here?

                        It's cool.  Just stay with me.

          Nathan rushes up. 

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        You're late!

                        Do you know how much money it
                        costs to pay security overtime?    

          Stephen rushes past, bass guitar in hand.

                        Come on, man!  Crowd's goin' crazy!    

          Roy pulls Aubrey towards the stage entrance, and before
          they go through -  Roy wraps a TURQUOISE BRACELET around
          her wrist.

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        I don't even know your name?

                        No, that won't do... Crystal.

                                        AUBREY
                        What? 

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        Anybody with eyes like those has
                        to be named - Crystal.  Wait here. 
                        And don't talk to that guy over
                          there... he's the Devil.

          Roy gestures towards Nathan, who just scowls.  Roy walks
          out ON-STAGE grabs his Fender as the crowd reacts.          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT TWO - 2/16/05 - WHT-2  27.

                        We still need to find something
                        that Roy and Aubrey shared.  Maybe
                        I can get a hit and find out what
                          happened to her.

          Johnny eases up next to the first door.

                        I feel like a peeping tom.

          He gently sets his finger tips on the door... WHOOSH!...
          Johnny steps away.

                        That's going to be a little bit
                        harder. 

                                        AUBREY
                        Are you sure you want to give up
                        the life of a rock 'n' roll star?

                        I guess when you're in love, the
                          furniture isn't that important.

          Johnny flicks on the bathroom lights and - WHOOSH!

          Aubrey is in the shower.  We can just make out her naked
          body behind the fogged glass.  An UNSEEN FIGURE steps
          into the bathroom.  The HAND turns on the sink faucet.

                                        AUBREY (O.S.)
                        Roy?  Whatchu doing back so soon?

          She OPENS the shower door and reaches for a towel.

                                        AUBREY (O.S.)
                          I thought you were going to the
                          studio... 

          When she grabs the towel she's jabbed with a SYRINGE. 
          Aubrey slides OPEN the shower door and stares bewildered
          at her UNSEEN ASSAILANT.

                                        AUBREY
                        Why?

                        I found her.  Nassau County, Long
                        Island, has a death certificate
                        for an Aubrey Henderson.  She
                        OD'ed the same year Roy died. 
                        But it says here the body was

                        That can't be right.  Johnny saw
                        her die in the bathroom of the
                        motel.  Unless somebody moved the

                        case has suddenly evolved into
                        cold blooded murder.  Maybe you
                        should back off and let the police
                        take over?

                        In the vision, Roy brought up the
                        idea of them getting married.  He
                        laughed about how it might ruin
                        his rock star image.

                        They came out of nowhere.  Like

                        he helped me choose the light
                        over the darkness.  And maybe, I

          Roy kneels over Aubrey's dead body, crying.  Upset. 
          Touching her TURQUOISE bracelet.  Johnny watches as Nathan
          comes into the bathroom.  He's all business, cold and
          calculated. 

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        I don't know what happened.  She
                        wanted to get some sleep while I
                        was up at the studio.

          Nathan checks her pulse. The syringe next to her arm...

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        We have to get you out of here...

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                        I'm not leaving her.  Not like
                        this... 

          Nathan pulls Roy up and SMACKS him.  (The same vision
          Johnny had of Nathan in Scene 15.)

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        You gonna throw your life away? 
                        Your career?  For what?  A
                          groupie?!

                                        YOUNGER ROY
                          Crystal's not a groupie.  I love
                        her.

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        We're in the middle of a North
                          American tour.  The press finds
                        this chick overdosed in your hotel
                        room, it's over.  Look, she's
                        already dead, but you have the
                        next minute to decide if your
                        career dies with her.          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT THREE - 2/11/05 - GREEN  38.


  5454RESUME - INT. NATHAN BERK'S OFFICE (NYC) - NIGHT

          Nathan pulls away from Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were there.  You covered up
                          Aubrey's death.  Did you kill
                        her, too?

                                        NATHAN
                        You have no idea what you're
                        talking about.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Money.  Lot's of money.  If Roy
                        takes off with Aubrey, you're
                        back booking one hit wonders. 
                        Imagine how much cash could have
                        been made if John Lennon hadn't
                        married Yoko Ono.  Five, maybe
                        six more Beatles records.  Big
                          business.

                                        NATHAN
                          I didn't kill anybody.  Besides, 
                        Roy Foldes is dead. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about his son?

                                        NATHAN
                        What about him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't he deserve a chance to
                        know what really happened to his
                        father?

                                        NATHAN
                        I'm not getting through to you am
                        I?  Darren Foldes is a disaster
                        waiting to happen.  I've tried to
                        help him, but the truth is he'll
                        never be his father.

          Angry, Nathan grabs a DEMO TAPE off his desk.

                                        NATHAN
                        I sent a guy down to tape his
                        show the other night.

          He throws the demo tape at Johnny.  As Johnny catches it:          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT THREE - 2/10/05 - YELLOW  39.

          DAY - VISION

          WHOOSH!  NDS OUT OF THE MIC.  DARREN IS ON THE STAGE.

          This is the SAME PERFORMANCE that Johnny and Sarah were
          at in Philadelphia.  (SCENE 24 REPEATED)

                                        DARREN
                        This last song is an original
                        tune.

          A DRUNK yells out...

                                        DRUNK
                        Play "I'll Remember"!

          THE SCENE CONTINUES PLAYING OUT JUST AS BEFORE, AS DARREN
          JUMPS INTO THE CROWD TO FIGHT, JOHNNY NOTICES SARAH AND
          HIMSELF IN THE AUDIENCE.

          Johnny notices a bearded man, 45ish, innocuously standing
          in the back.  It's Roy Foldes. 


  5656INT. NATHAN BERK'S OFFICE (NYC) - NIGHT

          Johnny reels from the vision.  Two SECURITY GUARDS enter.

                                        NATHAN
                        Escort Mister Smith down to the
                        street.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can find my way out.

          Johnny exits...


    56A56AHALLWAY OUTSIDE BERK'S OFFICE (NYC) - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny joins Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Darren's show, the one in Philly -
                        Roy was there.

                                        SARAH
                        You saw him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was in the back... in the dark.

                                        SARAH
                        He watches his son play.  That
                        means if we find Darren...

                                        JOHNNY
                        We might find Roy.          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT THREE - 2/10/05 - YELLOW  40.


  5757EXT. "THE VOGUE" NIGHTCLUB (NYC) - NIGHT

          Johnny and Sarah walk up to the velvet ropes - a sign
          says, SHOW CANCELED.  The MANAGER unhooks the ropes.

                                        SARAH
                        Show's been canceled?

                                        MANAGER
                        That's what the sign says.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened?

                                        MANAGER
                        Jack Daniel's, Johnny Walker,
                        take your pick.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was drunk?

                                        MANAGER
                        Looked like he'd been up all night.

                                        SARAH
                        In a way.

                                        MANAGER
                        Well, if you see him, tell him
                        he's not getting paid.  And give
                        him back this -

          The Manager SHOVES Darren's EMPTY GUITAR CASE into Johnny's
          chest:


  5858EXT. THE BLUFFS (LONG ISLAND, NY) - DAY - VISION

          The Corvette KICKS up dirt!  Johnny's behind the wheel,
          driving towards the edge, swigging a bottle of bourbon. 
          The car does a massive DROP into the ocean.  The Fender
          Strat GUITAR is in the passenger seat...


  5959EXT. "THE VOGUE" NIGHTCLUB (NYC) - NIGHT

          Johnny comes out of the vision, confused.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was in Roy's Corvette again, as
                        it was going over the cliff. 
                        Only it was different this time. 
                        I was driving and Roy's guitar
                        was in the passenger seat.

    59CONTINUED:59

          Sarah thinks for a moment, something's puzzling her.

                                        SARAH
                        Where's Darren playing tomorrow?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know. 

                                        SARAH
                        The box.

          She hurries away...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah?

  60A60AEXT. PARKING LOT (NYC) - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER

          Sarah has the tailgate down as she rummages through her
          open suitcase.  She digs out a mangled shoe box.

                                        SARAH
                        Got it.

          It's been written and drawn all over and is kept together
          with scotch tape and hair ribbons.

                                        SARAH
                        I've had this since I was thirteen. 
                        Everything important to me I put
                        in this box.

          Sarah opens the box and digs through it, setting various
          objects on the gate as she searches.  Maybe some photo
          booth pictures of her and Johnny, etc. 

                                        SARAH
                        It's been gnawing at me ever since
                        we first started on the trip. 
                        Here they are!

          She picks out a bundled wad of multi-colored tickets.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's that?

                                        SARAH
                          Memories.  Every ticket stub,
                        from every concert I ever saw.

    60ACONTINUED:60A

          She starts sorting through them, setting the Roy Foldes
          ticket stubs in a separate line.

                                        SARAH
                        We started in Portland.  Then to
                        Philly.

          She lays each stub in order of date and city.

                                        SARAH
                        Then New York.  And finally,
                        Boston.

          The stubs line up perfectly, by date and city, only from
          20 years ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (realizing)
                          Darren's touring the same cities
                        in the exact sequence Roy did
                        before he died.

                                        SARAH
                        It gets even weirder.  Do you
                        know what tomorrow is?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, but I have a feeling it's not
                          something good.

                                        SARAH
                        Tomorrow's the anniversary of
                        Roy's death.  Johnny, I don't
                        think your vision was Roy's
                          death... I think it was Darren's.

          Johnny and Sarah RACE through the twisty roads.  Sarah's
          got a map spread out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How much farther?

                        Maybe 30 miles.

                        Roy's car took a dive just after
                          sunrise.  If Darren's recreating
                        his father's death...

          Johnny notices the sun peaking over the horizon.

                                        SARAH
                        We're never gonna make it.

          Johnny suddenly notices Darren's napkin with his cell
          phone number sticking out of the glove compartment.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we don't have to.

                                                                              INTERCUT:


  6565EXT. THE BLUFF (LONG ISLAND, NY) - DAWN

          A cell RINGS.  On a quiet bluff...

          The Corvette idles.  Darren looks out over the ocean. 
          Guitar by his side.  The sun rising.  A peaceful moment,
          except that really annoying cell phone RINGS.  He takes
          another swig of liquid courage, then answers it.

                                        DARREN
                        I'm busy... call back later.

          Darren starts to shut off the phone, but...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darren!  Don't hang up!  It's
                        Johnny Smith! 

                                        DARREN
                        Who?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Johnny Smith.  The guy who's been
                          following you around?

                                        DARREN
                        What do you want?  How did you
                        get this number?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't matter.  Darren, I
                        know what you're planning to do. 

                                        DARREN
                        Man, you don't even know me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know your pain.  At least, I
                        can imagine it.  Trying to live
                        up to the memory of somebody you
                        never even met. 

                                        DARREN
                        You have no idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then tell me.  Tell me how it
                        feels?

          Darren takes a big hit off the bottle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darren?  You still there?

          Darren lifts the phone to his ear.

                                        DARREN
                        I love the music.  That feeling
                        when you're able to reach out and
                        touch somebody's soul.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That must be a great feeling.

                                        DARREN
                        Except nobody wants me, not the
                        real me.  They want that thing,
                        that part of me that doesn't exist. 
                        They want him.
                                (beat)
                        If that's what they want, that's
                        what they'll get.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darren, if you drive off that
                        cliff, you still won't be your
                        father.  You'll just be a Rock'n
                        roll footnote.  A bad joke somebody
                        makes at a party. 

          Darren swigs his bottle of bourbon.

                                        DARREN
                        That's the problem, bro.  I am a
                        joke.  I always have been.

          Darren hangs up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Darren?  Dammit!

          Johnny looks at Sarah and shakes his head.

          Darren swigs.  A glance in the rear view shows us he's
          crying.  He cranks up the powerful engine. 

                                        SARAH
                        What did he say?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think we're too late.

          Shaking, Darren CLUTCHES into first.  He takes a deep
          breath, then GUNS the engine, the Corvette KICKS UP dirt
          as he SPINS THE WHEELS, then drives fast towards the edge
          of the cliff!


  6666EXT. THE BLUFF (LONG ISLAND, NY) - CONTINUOUS

          WIDE SHOT of the car tearing towards the edge at top speed.

          Darren grips the wheel, his eyes filled with tears.  He
          glances over at the guitar.  It's now or never.


  6767EXT. THE BLUFF (LONG ISLAND, NY) - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny's SUV races up to the edge of the bluff.  Johnny
          and Sarah hop out.  They rush to the edge and...


          POV - WRECKED CORVETTE

          The car is crushed and slightly submerged in the water
          below.

    67CONTINUED:67

          RESUME JOHNNY AND SARAH

          They can't believe what they're looking at, then...

                                        DARREN (O.S.)
                          Headline reads!

          They SPIN to see Darren sitting against a tree, drunk. 
          Guitar by his side.  Bottle of bourbon nearly gone.  He's
          all dirty and scuffed up.

                                        DARREN
                          "Struggling musician commits
                          suicide, album goes gold and nobody
                          cares..."

          Sarah MOVES to him.

                                        SARAH
                        Are you okay?

                                        DARREN
                        I don't know.  I'm drunk.  Which
                        is probably a good thing to be if
                        you're gonna throw yourself out
                        of car movin' 60 miles per.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm just glad you changed your
                        mind.

                                        DARREN
                        There's one thing I still can't
                        seem to figure out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's that?

                                        DARREN
                        Who ARE you people?

                                        SARAH
                              (a smile)
                        Fans.  We're big fans.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looks like you dropped some fan
                        mail.

          Johnny notices some dirty looking envelopes scattered on
          the ground a few feet away from the kid.  One of them
          just has DARREN, written on it.  Johnny picks it up as is
          thrown into a vision:          DEAD ZONE: THE LAST GOODBYE - ACT FOUR - 2/11/05 - GREEN  47.


  6868INT. DINER (NEW HAVEN, CT) - DAY - PRESENT DAY - VISION

            A nondescript diner.  Johnny sits in a booth across from
          Roy Foldes, 45ish.  Drinking coffee by himself.  Roy writes
          an anonymous letter to his son, Darren.  We SEE some KEY
          WORDS AND PHRASES...

          "I've seen you play..." "...like your father."  "...don't
          give up."  "A loyal fan." 

          He seals it and writes DARREN FOLDES across the front of
          the envelope.  Exactly like the envelope Johnny picked up
          off the ground.

          Johnny looks around and sees the NEON SIGN of the diner. 
          (It's outside facing forwards; from inside, the letters
          are backwards.)  From Johnny's POV, it reads:

          "S'AHTRAM"


  6969EXT. THE BLUFF (LONG ISLAND, NY) - DAWN

          Johnny comes out of the vision, pulls Sarah aside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think I know where Roy is.


  7070EXT. DINER (NEW HAVEN, CT) - LATER THAT DAY

          It's the same diner from Johnny's vision.  Same neon sign. 
          Johnny's SUV sits in the parking lot.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is the place.  How's our boy
                        doing?

          Sarah glances into the back seat where we SEE Darren passed
          out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Eight hours on the road and he
                        hasn't budged.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm still not sure he believes
                        us.

          Sarah's attention is drawn across the lot.

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, my God.

          SARAH AND JOHNNY'S POV - BEARDED MAN

          The guy exits the side door carrying several large garbage
          bags.  Roy Foldes in the flesh.

                                        SARAH
                        That's him, isn't it?

                        That's him.

                        What do we say?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just tell him how you feel.

                                        SARAH
                        Me?

          She realizes what Johnny already knows... this journey
          has been hers and she needs to finish it herself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll be inside if you need me.

  7272EXT. BACK OF THE DINER (NEW HAVEN, CT) - DAY

          Roy tosses the garbage bags into a dumpster.

                        You look just the way I remember.

          Roy TURNS to REVEAL SARAH.  She stands behind him.

                                        SARAH
                        You've put on few pounds and you
                        grew the beard... but I could
                        never forget those eyes.

                                        ROY
                        Lady, you got me mixed up with
                        someone else.

                                        SARAH
                        You're Roy Foldes.

          He hesitates, then...

                        Gumbo, right?

          Roy takes a second, then HEAVES a few heavy trash bags.

                                        SARAH
                        It wasn't your fault, you know.

          Roy SLAMS the dumpster door shut.

                                        ROY
                        Excuse me?

                        her death, but she didn't overdose. 
                        She was murdered.  By somebody
                        close to you.

          He can hardly believe what he's hearing, as tears well up
          in his eyes, then...

                                        ROY
                        Who are you?

                          Somebody you once helped through
                        a tough situation once.  Somebody
                        who'd like to return the favor.

                                        ROY
                        Roy Foldes is dead, lady.  He's
                        dust in the wind.

          Roy walks off.  Sarah is stunned.  Until she blurts out:

                                        SARAH
                        Maybe you should tell his son?!

          Roy stops in his tracks.

                                        SARAH
                        He nearly killed himself a few
                        hours ago.  I imagine he'll try
                        again unless... unless somebody
                        tells why he shouldn't.

          Roy notices Darren across the lot as he climbs out of the
          SUV and looks around...

                        I'll introduce you to him, if you
                        want?

          Roy can't take his eyes off his son, as Darren notices
          him too.  It's an instant connection...

                        Just coffee, black.

          He turns to look out the window.

          A tinted SUV pulls into the parking lot in the front of
          the diner.  Nathan Berk gets out.


  7474EXT. BACK OF THE DINER (NEW HAVEN, CT) - DAY

          Darren and Roy stand in front of one another.  The
          similarity between them is striking.  There's some awkward
          silence, then..

                                        DARREN
                        This is awkward.

                                        ROY
                        It's that alright.  I don't know
                        where to start.  I've heard you
                        play.  A few times.

                                        DARREN
                        You've seen me on stage? 

                                        ROY
                        You're good.  A little heavy with
                        the right hand, but you can fix
                        that.

                                        DARREN
                        I was born with these stubby
                          fingers.

          There's more awkward silence, then...

                        There's so much I need to tell
                        you.  So much I need to explain.

                                        DARREN
                        We got time.  Don't we?

          Roy glances over at Sarah, then back at the kid.

                                        ROY
                        Yeah, we got some time.

          Sarah is about to cry.


  7575EXT. DINER (LONG ISLAND, NY) - DAY

            Meanwhile Johnny walks out in front of the diner as Berk
            approaches...

                                        NATHAN
                        So you found him?  I'm impressed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about. 

                                        NATHAN
                        Don't play games with me.  You
                        had to keep digging, you couldn't
                        just let it go, could you?

          Nathan grabs Johnny by the front of his jacket.   WHOOSH.


  7676EXT. THE BLUFF (LONG ISLAND, NY) - DAWN - 1987 - VISION

          Roy's '81 Corvette sits idling at the edge of the bluff. 
          Roy and Nathan stand in front of it.

                                        YOUNGER NATHAN
                        You sure this is what you want?

  7777EXT. MARTHA'S GRITS (NEW HAVEN, CT) - DAY

          Johnny reels from the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You knew the whole time?

                                        NATHAN
                        This is none of your business!

                                        ROY (O.S.)
                        Nathan!

          Nathan and Johnny turn to see Roy, Darren and Sarah.

                                        ROY
                        Let him go.  It's over.

          Nathan lets go of Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You helped Roy stage his death.

                                        NATHAN
                        For a psychic it takes you a long
                        time to catch on.

                                        SARAH
                        If it wasn't Nathan that killed
                        Aubrey, who was it?

          Johnny recognizes the turquoise bracelet on Roy's arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That bracelet belonged to Aubrey...

                                        ROY
                        That's right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Would you mind?

          Roy hesitates, then slips it off and hands it to Johnny,
          WHOOSH! -- just as a ROCK LIFE VAN whips into the far
          side of the parking lot.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think it might be better if you
                        finish this inside.

          ANOTHER ANGLE - VAN - MOMENTS LATER

          Doug Driscoll hops out of the back door, clumsy CAMERA*
          MAN in tow.  Driscoll approaches Johnny with a knowing*
          grin.

                                        DOUG
                        You found HIM?!  I knew you would.

  8080INT. NEPTOON RECORDS STORE (ROCKLAND COUNTY, NY) - DAY

          Johnny and Sarah walk into the records store.  Vickings
          is organizing some records.

                                        VICKINGS
                        You guys come back for some more
                        rock 'n' roll stories?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually, we came to tell you
                        one.

          Johnny picks out the album "From Within to Without."

                                        JOHNNY
                        Man, I loved this record.  This
                        carried me through high school.

                        You might call it the soundtrack
                        of our teenage lives.

          Vickings has a bad vibe about where this might be going...

                                        VICKINGS
                        Look, I got work to do...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You co-wrote these songs... but
                        you never wrote again after Roy
                        died.  How come?

                                        VICKINGS
                        It's simple.  I lost my
                          inspiration.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe.  Or maybe you never wrote
                        them to begin with.

                                        SARAH
                        You and Roy were childhood friends. 
                        There were rumors that he let you
                        put your name down and collect
                        fifty percent of the royalties.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Everything was fine until Aubrey
                        came along.  Roy was tired of the
                        grind.  He wanted to get off the
                        road.  Get married and settle
                        down.  But that would have been a
                        problem for you.  You had to find
                        a way to change his mind.

                                        SARAH
                        So you killed the woman he loved
                        and made it look like an overdose.

          Stephen stares up at them, his eyes a tornado of emotion.

                        You murdered her.

          Vickings is wheeled into the back of a police van.  He
          glances back to see Roy standing with Darren, Sarah, Doug
          and Johnny.  He looks stunned, like he's seen a ghost.

                                        ROY
                        All those years, you think you

                        Then you find out it was all a

                        Not all of it.

          Roy realizes exactly what he's been given -- a second
          chance.

                                        DOUG
                        I know I promised not to spill
                        the beans about you and, you know,
                        all of this.  But would you do me
                          a favor?  Would you call me first

                                        SARAH
                        Just promise me you'll never
                          disappear again.

                                        DARREN
                        I'll make sure of that.

          They all shake hands as Darren and Roy walk away.

                                        SARAH
                        I hope we did the right thing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They'll be okay.

          A tear rolls down Sarah's cheek.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, don't cry.

                                        SARAH
                        I was just thinking about the
                        choices we make in life.  How we
                        can never really be sure what's
                        right and what's wrong.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Regrets?

                                        SARAH
                        I have a husband who loves me
                            unconditionally, a little boy
                        that makes everyday seem new and
                        a dear friend that would do
                          anything for me.  What's to regret?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah... what's to regret?

          They hesitate as if they both might have something else
          to say, then Johnny slips his arm around her shoulder and
          they walk away as the SHOT PUSHES TIGHT on a vintage poster
          in the store window.  A poster of Roy Foldes.

          OVER THE SHOT, we HEAR Roy Foldes sing "6 Feet Under" (or*
          "Free")...*
