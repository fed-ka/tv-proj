Mist. Dark trees.
Dripping vines.
An ENGINE RUMBLES in the
distance.
The full moon shimmers on a puddle.
A FROG SPLATS IN,
splashing a one man pup tent.
INSIDE THE TENT
LUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen
asleep reading by flashlight. He's nineteen, still slightly
awkward and unaware he's growing handsome.
He listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer.
He peers out through the tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR
toward him. Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he HURLS
himself against the side of the tent, as...
OUTSIDE
an RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop
in the mud.
Stillness.
Luke extricates himself from the tent.
He runs to the driver-
side window of the RV.
LUKE
Are you all right?
Inside, ALEXA, thirties, earthy, looks up at him bleary-eyed.
She nods 'yes.'
LUKE (CONT'D)
How did you even get here?
There's
no road.
ALEXA
I'm sorry.
I'm from Utah.
LUKE
It's okay.
ALEXA
Are you alone out here?
2.
He nods 'yes.'
She bursts into TEARS.
ALEXA (CONT'D)
My husband. Bastard. I've been
driving for days. I don't even
know where I'm going.
LUKE
Oh, wow.
I'm really sorry.
She gathers herself, sniffling.
I have warm apple kringel in the
camper. Would you like some?
LUKE
Uh, what is it?
ALEXA
Pastry.
INSIDE RV CAMPER
Luke stands at the RV's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry
off a paper plate.
ALEXA
So, this "Survival Quest" is your
vacation?
LUKE
Yeah. It's my third try.
Kind a'
lame, huh?
ALEXA
No. Seven days alone in the
wilderness?
I'd be afraid.
LUKE
It's just something I really wanted
to do.
Luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink.
ALEXA
His shoes. Fishing lures.
The
electric drill.
LUKE
Good.
3.
She smiles, grateful, eyeing his torn t-shirt and shorts.
ALEXA
You're all wet and muddy. Why
don't I hang those up to dry?
LUKE
Thanks.
I'm okay.
ALEXA
I'm propositioning you.
LUKE
Oh...
Oh, wow.
You are?
He considers, fearful, but thrilled.
Students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle.
The huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old
SEMI-TRUCK RUMBLES up to the curb. It's the cab only, like
the sliced-off front of a train engine.
Luke hops down, startling his friends, KEENAN and JANINE,
passionately making out on the sidewalk.
Twenty, brainy and athletic, Janine adjusts her glasses, the
only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers
Luke's massive truck.
JANINE
It's remarkable. Sort of retro. I
thought you were gettin' a pickup?
LUKE
I changed my mind.
Hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to Keenan,
who climbs up and peeks inside the cab. He's rugged,
streetwise, perpetually bemused, -maybe Ed Norton and Bill
Murray had a son...
KEENAN
It's awesome. It's pleather.
LUKE
Fuck you.
You think it's stupid.
4.
Janine stares at him.
LUKE (CONT'D)
What?
She shrugs, trying to put her finger on it, and when Luke
rolls up his T-shirt sleeves, she grins.
LUKE (CONT'D)
What?!
JANINE
Oh my God. You got laid.
Finally! Who is she?
Luke glares at Keenan.
KEENAN
I didn't say a word! I swear!
You
know Janine. She's got X-ray
vision.
(to Janine)
Camping! A total stranger.
JANINE
I knew that whole "waitin' to meet
the right girl" thing was crap.
Congratulations! I have to get to
Physics. The truck's great.
KEENAN
See ya', hottie.
JANINE
Could find something to call me,
other than what every guy in the
world would say?
KEENAN
"Sweetheart?" "Babe?"
"Aphrodite?"
Janine sneers.
At a loss, Keenan grabs her and kisses her
passionately.
She walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it.
Keenan climbs up into the cab.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
So this is gonna' be like your car?
5.
LUKE
Look, I know it's dopey. But don't
you recognize it? It's painted and
the muffler's switched out, -but
this was my dad's.
Keenan looks around with fresh eyes. He reaches an arm way
up under the glove box and GRINS, pulling out a small stash
of weed.
KEENAN
Ten years.
A little dried out.
The truck barrels along through the trees.
Luke and Keenan
share a joint.
LUKE
First off, that woman. We didn't
go all the way, you know?
KEENAN
Yeah?
Okay, so?
LUKE
You think technically I'm still a
virgin?
KEENAN
Were you inside her?
LUKE
Yeah.
KEENAN
It counts.
Next.
...What?
LUKE
I been havin' this weird dream.
The thing is, I think maybe the
dream's real. Forget it. No way
I'm tellin' you.
KEENAN
You know enough of my secrets to
get me shot. Sharon's mom on
Thanksgiving? What the fuck dream
is there you can't tell me?
6.
LUKE
It's about part of me gettin'
smaller. An important part.
Keenan looks over warily, then busts out LAUGHING, then
realizes Luke's serious.
KEENAN
You have gotta' be fuckin' kiddin'
me. You're not thirteen!
LUKE
Screw you.
Maybe I caught
something.
KEENAN
I think it's good you bought this
truck.
They both LAUGH.
Cheap elegance. Luke and Michelle dine on the patio, strung
with far too many white lights.
MICHELLE
I caught him with my best friend.
Former. Such a cliche'.
LUKE
Sorry.
MICHELLE
Winthrop Hawkins. "Hawk." From
this Park Avenue family. He'd know
what kind of mushrooms those are,
what the best wine is.
LUKE
The best wine is beer.
MICHELLE
I'm such a moron.
LUKE
You're not.
MICHELLE
No, I am.
I have incontrovertible
proof.
She kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table,
a TATTOO of a GREEN BIRD on her ankle.
12.
MICHELLE (CONT'D)
It's a hawk. Get it? "Hawkins?"
See, you're smirking!
LUKE
I'm not.
MICHELLE
And it's GREEN! That's the one
color tattoo they can't REMOVE!
LUKE
Oh.
Bummer.
MICHELLE
I'm considering a prosthetic foot.
She smiles.
They sip from their glasses and drink each other in.
Luke contemplates a kiss,...
but his breathing grows shallow, he GASPS.
MICHELLE (CONT'D)
What's the matter?
LUKE
Nothin'. Maybe just kind a' hot
out here. You want moron? When my
dad died, -it's okay, I was nine.
I barely knew what was goin' on-
But I thought the tombstone was
really sad looking, so I painted
smiley faces and fish all over it.
MICHELLE
That's sweet.
LUKE
Yeah, I'm sure dad would've loved
that.
His face REDDENS. Overheated, Luke tugs at his shirt,
brushes SWEAT from his brow.
MICHELLE
So, what do you think makes a good
relationship?
13.
LUKE
For real? I don't know.
Friendship. Great sex. Knowing
you want to be there even when it
gets scary or bloody.
MICHELLE
Whoa.
Where'd that come from?
LUKE
Sorry.
MICHELLE
No, it's just not the usual guy
thing. ...You're great, you know?
Luke puts his hand on his chest, FEELS something.
He stands, puts on his jacket.
LUKE
Will you excuse me a sec'?
NEAR THE KITCHEN
HYPER-VENTILATING, his arms CLUTCHING HIS CHEST,
BEADS OF SWEAT on his forehead,
Luke checks the Men's Room door: LOCKED.
He ducks out the service entrance.
By the dumpster, Luke reaches behind his head, WHIPS off his
jacket and shirt, and looks down...
His eyes GO WIDE.
LUKE
-AAH!
On his chest: FEMALE BREASTS.
Two WAITERS come outside for a smoke.
FIRST WAITER
Table twenty-nine. Like to bring
her the cannoli special.
14.
Luke peers over the dumpster, down at his breasts, with a
HIGH FEVER, and PASSES OUT, slumping to the ground.
BEHIND THE DUMPSTER - LATE NIGHT
Luke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented. He's lying on the
ground, shirtless among bits of garbage.
He watches bleary-eyed, as a MOUSE peers at him from inside
an empty milk carton. The mouse runs over and sniffs at a
canteloupe, which triggers Luke's memory:
He GRABS his chest, relieved to find it's back to normal.
He stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and
staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck.
Luke's Semi THUNDERS along.
INSIDE THE CAB
Luke stares out in shock.
He hears HEAVY BREATHING, MOANS, VOICES.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Oh yes!
Don't stop!
He looks around for the source of the sounds, glances over.
RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR
in it's reflection a leering male, stripped to the waist.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Lie down for me, baby!
The HEAD LAMPS of an oncoming car FLASH at him.
As he glances out the driver-side window, MUSIC BLARES from
the passing car.
INSIDE THE CAR
A glimpse of what might be an ORGY of BODIES intertwined.
The FEMALE DRIVER - GRINS MANIACALLY UP at Luke as the CAR
HORN SCREAMS by.
Luke CAREENS to one side, glancing at the truck's
15.
LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR
The car recedes in the distance, but the Female Driver
appears CLOSE in the mirror's reflection, LEERING. She LICKS
THE MIRROR from the inside, and disappears.
THROUGH THE TRUCK WINDSHIELD
Luke stares out, EYES GLAZED.
Luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair,
trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell.
Hearing something behind him, he turns as Max PUNCHES him in
the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.
17.
MAX
You son-of-a-bitch, stay the hell
away from my sister!
Luke GASPS for air.
MAX (CONT'D)
You don't say a word?! You just
leave her sittin' there?!
LUKE
I came to apologize.
Max shoves him across the yard.
MAX
Get out a' here!
She's not home,
anyway.
LUKE
Will you tell her I came by?
MAX
No. She's honest with you, so you
bolt? And then what, you wake up
feelin' sorry for her?
LUKE
No! Is that what she thinks?
I
left 'cause a' what she said?
That's crazy! She's like the most
incredible girl I ever met!
Max sneers, skeptical.
LUKE (CONT'D)
I had this 'pasta quattro funghi' -
four mushroom. It took me a while
to even figure it out, but I think
someone put shrooms in it, or
somehow they got in there by
mistake. I was hallucinating and
everything.
MAX
Amazes even me, a guy's capacity to
be a world-class asshole.
Fortunately, I'm familiar with the
cause.
18.
LUKE
Will you please just tell her I
came by? Forget it. I'll catch up
with her on my own.
MAX
No.
You won't.
LUKE
Look, I'm gonna' see her again, -if
she'll see me. I don't care what
the fuck you say about it.
MAX
Oh, really?
They face off.
LUKE
Yeah, really.
MAX
You get near her, I'll feed your
nuts to the neighbor's dog!
LUKE
What kind a' dog is it?
MAX
Huh?
LUKE
I mean, is it a pitbull, or what?
Caught off guard, a smile escapes Max.
LUKE (CONT'D)
I'm crazy about her.
MAX
Shrooms, huh?
Luke nods 'yes.'
MAX (CONT'D)
I'll tell her you came by.
Luke nods, appreciative.
19.
A tanker truck QUAKES past. Surrounded by fir trees, the
eerily empty mini-mart glows with fluorescent junk food.
INSIDE MINI-MART
Luke stands behind the cash register, leafing through "The
Outdoors Man."
The CHIME BINGS and SYDNEY enters, early thirties, elegant in
thrift-store chic. She's cool and in control, ...at least on
the outside.
She surveys random candy bars, stealing glances at Luke.
SYDNEY
Had a sudden intense craving for a
cherry popsicle.
LUKE
You can check in that freezer.
SYDNEY
What a relief. I'm Sydney.
You?
LUKE
Luke.
SYDNEY
Workin' late, huh?
Luke?
LUKE
Yeah, four AM. It sucks.
SYDNEY
Sometimes you guys are just
unfathomably stupid.
LUKE
Excuse me?
SYDNEY
Why in the world do guys say "it
sucks" as if it were a bad thing?
I mean, every guy's dying to get a
blow job, right? So, you think
they'd treat those words with
profound respect, like holy
scripture. "What an unbelievable
sunset, honey: doesn't it just
SUCK?,"... "You won an Olympic Gold
Medal?!, that BLOWS!"
20.
LUKE
I guess you're right.
SYDNEY
It must be great at your age. That
river of testosterone coursing
through your veins, the damn about
to burst! How about we just lock
this place up and go for an Olympic
Gold?
LUKE
No thanks.
Jeez, lady.
Disappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door.
SYDNEY
I ought to dye my hair.
Don't you
think?
LUKE
Uh, I don't know.
Looks fine.
SYDNEY
Your hair is such an incredible
color.
LUKE
It's brown.
SYDNEY
I love it. Do you think I could
cut just a little piece? Match the
color? It really "sucks."
LUKE
Nah, c'mon. You're messin' with
me.
SYDNEY
I'm not. I love it. You really
should get rid a' that thing,
anyway. I have clippers in my bag.
LUKE
What thing?
SYDNEY
Cowlick. Right here.
See?
I can
just snip it off.
She SNIPS his hair.
Luke pulls away.
21.
LUKE
Hey.
SYDNEY
What's the matter? Don't you like
being touched? Don't you like
being a guy?
LUKE
No. I mean,... What?
Sorry, but
you're just bizarre.
She CHUCKLES, lays money on the counter.
SYDNEY
May be. But I learned long ago,
you can't change your true nature,
even if it can change you.
As she leaves, she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle.
Acres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse
converted into a pool hall. The windows glow from warm
lights inside.
Parked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks, cars, and
Luke's Semi.
INSIDE POOL HALL
Smoke, ROWDY MUSIC and the CLACK of cue balls.
Keenan and Luke snake their way through the pool tables.
LUKE
Holy shit. It's that lady from the
store! Grey and black at the bar.
Keenan looks over at Sydney, finishing off a bourbon.
RENTAL COUNTER
Janine and Michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from
the worldly British owner, POLLY.
She runs the place like a wild west saloon, with such ease
and confidence, it suggests there may be a shotgun under the
bar.
22.
POLLY
That boy, Keenan, still giving you
trouble?
JANINE
Actually, I tried exactly what you
said.
POLLY
And...?
JANINE
Unbelievable! Thanks.
POLLY
Works every time.
(to Michelle)
Nice to meet you, darling. I hope
you'll find not too many rules
here, and the drinks not too dear.
MICHELLE
Yeah, thanks. It's amazing.
Polly moves off.
JANINE
Isn't she great? Guys drive across
the state just to buy a beer from
her. Total loner, though.
No
one's ever seen her with anyone.
MICHELLE
What did she tell you to try?
Janine whispers in her ear.
Michelle's jaw drops open, scandalized.
They LAUGH.
AT THE BAR
Luke hands his keys to JEREMY, the handsome bartender, in
exchange for a full pitcher of beer.
LUKE
Thanks, man.
KEENAN
Oh, God. She's eyeing you.
I
think she's comin' over.
23.
Sydney saunters up.
SYDNEY
Can I buy you a drink?
LUKE
Uh, no thanks. We're already here
with dates and stuff.
SYDNEY
You are?
Who? Where is she?
KEENAN
They're around somehwere.
SYDNEY
Luke, if you like this girl, we
better talk.
LUKE
What?
Sydney glances around, talks quietly.
SYDNEY
Anything happen since we last
spoke? Hot flashes? Pressure in
your chest?
Luke pales.
LUKE
No.
KEENAN
Who are you?
SYDNEY
Dr. Sydney Catchadourian.
Keenan,
right?
LUKE
You know him?!
SYDNEY
We exchanged E-mail.
I came right
away.
Luke gives Keenan the evil eye.
KEENAN
From Philadelphia?
Why?
24.
SYDNEY
Your friend here has an extra
chromosome.
The little remaining color in Luke's face now drains away.
He shakes his head 'no.'
LUKE
Someone put mushrooms in my
mushroom sauce.
SYDNEY
I tested your hair.
LUKE
You're like some whack job.
Get
the hell away from me.
Luke moves off, sloshing beer.
Sydney sighs.
SYDNEY
Denial, denial, denial. Always the
first step. Keep him away from
that girl.
KEENAN
What're you talkin' about?
SYDNEY
Chromosomes. Most people have
forty-six: Two X if you're a girl,
an X and Y if you're a guy. He's
got forty seven: An X, a Y, and a
Z.
POOL TABLE
Janine and Michelle select pool cues.
JANINE
We've only been together six
months. And he's such a guy's guy,
everyone's buddy, but, alcoholic
parents, six months in "Juvey."
MICHELLE
Wild past, huh?
25.
JANINE
I think the only reason he's even
alive right now, is okay, partly
'cause he's so damn smart, but
mostly 'cause there's this one
person, he knows, absolutely, no
matter what, won't bale on him.
MICHELLE
You.
JANINE
No. He doesn't trust me at all.
Luke. He's a rock.
MICHELLE
Yeah?
JANINE
So, yes, you can trust him. I'm
hoping Keenan's the same way.
'Cause believe me, I'm not used to
rocks, I'm used to pebbles.
Michelle LAUGHS.
MICHELLE
Grains of sand.
Luke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer, glancing back
toward the bar. Keenan comes too, with a look of concern.
JANINE
Everything okay?
KEENAN
Sure.
I need a drink.
Keenan steals glances at Luke, trying to sort it all out.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
(aside to Luke)
That lady's nuts.
Luke nods.
AT THE BAR
Sydney sits at a bar stool, keeping an eye on Luke and
Michelle. Jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin, speaks with a
slight Texas drawl.
26.
JEREMY
Another round?
SYDNEY
Please. You see that couple over
there? I don't get it. What's he
see in her?
JEREMY
The brunette? You kiddin'? I'd
give my left one to be with her.
SYDNEY
Yeah?
So could he.
POOL TABLE - LATER
Now alone with Michelle, Luke lines up his cue stick, then
catches Michelle's admiring eyes.
She smiles, glances over at Keenan and Janine, making out by
the jukebox.
MICHELLE
Your friends sorta' like each
other, huh?
LUKE
Super-glue. Thirty seconds
together, you can't pull 'em apart.
MICHELLE
How'd they meet?
LUKE
Keenan sold her a bike. I don't
think they've been apart more than
six hours since.
Luke peers over the corner pocket, and watches Michelle shoot
and sink the ball.
LUKE (CONT'D)
I never thought in a million years
you'd go out with me, let alone
twice.
MICHELLE
You're not s'posed to say that.
That's a total pathetic, loser
thing to say. But I'm gonna' take
it as a huge compliment.
27.
MICHELLE (CONT'D)
Okay, two word answers only. Why'd
you ask me out in the first place?
LUKE
Beautiful. Unpretentious.
Why'd
you say 'yes?'
MICHELLE
Gentle.
Luke sneers, not his favorite compliment.
MICHELLE (CONT'D)
...Hot.
Deep.
Three words.
He smiles.
LUKE
Okay, two words. What're you most
passionate about?
MICHELLE
Friendship. Trust.
You?
LUKE
Hockey.
...Hockey.
MICHELLE
So much for "deep."
They LAUGH.
LUKE
You.
The electricity between them charges the air.
Luke maneuvers himself closer.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Okay, I'm gonna' take a wild shot.
Ricochet off the back, over here,
then straight into that side
pocket. What are my chances?
MICHELLE
Point zero zero zero one.
Luke takes his shot,...
and KISSES HER.
The ball ricochets off the back, across the table, and sinks
in the pocket at the side.
28.
AT THE BAR
Jeremy looks on, aroused.
Sydney squints, dismayed, barely
able to watch.
JEREMY
Damn. Will you look at that tonsil
hockey?
SYDNEY
I'd prefer not. This could get
bad.
JEREMY
You've been staring at him all
night. You got a thing for him, or
what?
SYDNEY
Actually, I'm hoping he's got one
for me.
POOL TABLE
Keenan and Janine rejoin Luke and Michelle, all four elated.
KEENAN
Looks like you two are gettin' on
okay. Should we rack up another
game?
MICHELLE
Definitely! I'd like to get good
at this pool thing.
Luke racks up the balls as Michelle lines up the cue.
MICHELLE (CONT'D)
Okay, I'm gonna' break this wide
open!
LUKE
Go for it!
Before Keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack,
Michelle HAMMERS the cue ball.
It CRACKS off the rack,
ROCKETS off the table,...
and CANNONBALLS Luke in the CROTCH.
29.
Keenan, Michelle, and Janine ALL GASP.
They CRINGE, poised, waiting for Luke to react.
MICHELLE
God.
Sorry.
Luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the
table.
He sees them watching him.
LUKE
What?
KEENAN
Man, I'd be on the floor cryin'
like a baby.
LUKE
No, I'm all right.
Surprised, they return to the game.
Michelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,...
with a slow-dawning realization that something, somehow, just
isn't right.
He casually touches his hand to his pants.
He pales slightly.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Would you excuse me a sec'?
He looks to Keenan for help.
AT THE BAR
Sydney watches as Keenan and Luke cross the hall toward the
back.
She flags Jeremy.
SYDNEY
Jeremy! Bourbon. Fast!
(a glance at Luke)
Better give me the whole bottle.
30.
OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM
Luke tries the men's room door, locked.
KEENAN
In here.
Keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room.
Luke follows, with a look of concern.
INSIDE STORE ROOM
KEENAN (CONT'D)
I mean, it was like a precision-
guided missile.
Luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers.
He looks down, SHUDDERS,...
LUKE
Uh- ah-
Luke's face CONTORTS, terrified.
KEENAN
I'll get some ice.
Luke shakes his head "no," points toward his crotch, GASPS,
barely able to make a sound...
LUKE
It's-!
Look!
Keenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed...
KEENAN
What?
then takes a look,...
His EYES GET HUGE.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
DUDE!!!
Sydney BURSTS in with the bottle of bourbon.
SYDNEY
I was afraid a' this!
(to Keenan)
Make sure no one gets in!
31.
SYDNEY (CONT'D)
(to Luke)
Now, will you listen to me?!
Luke, slack-jawed, keeps checking himself.
Each time the
horror of it grows more intense.
LUKE
Oh, GOD!
Sydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a
prescription bottle.
SYDNEY
It's gonna' come back.
Drink this!
LUKE
What're you givin' me?!
SYDNEY
Valium. Flexeril. And a shitload
of Darvon. You gotta' calm down.
LUKE
"Caaalm Down?!!!!!!"
SYDNEY
Here we go...
He and Sydney have to yell to hear over Luke's escalating
MANTRA...
LUKE
"CAAALM DOWN?!!!"
KEENAN
What's wrong with him?!
SYDNEY
He's a Zerophiliac.
KEENAN
A what?! I'm gettin' a doctor!
This isn't right!
Sydney GRABS Keenan, SHOVES him against the wall.
SYDNEY
I am a doctor! You breathe one
word, anyone else sees him like
this, and he's fucked! Pictures
all over the net, tabloids,
television!
32.
LUKE
TELE-VISION?!!
SYDNEY
No!
We're gonna' get it back!
(to Keenan)
You let me help him, he gets a
normal body, lives a normal life.
Now, you his friend or not?!
Keenan nods that 'yes, he is.'
Sydney releases him.
SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Hang onto him. So he doesn't get
hurt when he passes out.
KEENAN
Now just wait a sec'?
Is it
CONTAGIOUS?!
SYDNEY
There are no recorded incidents of
transmission from physical contact.
KEENAN
"Recorded incidents?!!"
LUKE
Oh, PLEASE God!
What did I DO
WRONG?!
SYDNEY
Nothing.
You're a Z.
KEENAN
"RECORDED INCIDENTS?!"
Oh my God,
I used his deodorant!
SYDNEY
Oh, will you calm down?
KEENAN
"C A L M
D O W N ?!!!"
LUKE
"C A L M
D O W N ?!!!"
Luke's eyes glaze over...
He weaves, losing his balance...
SYDNEY
Finally.
33.
Sydney helps Luke FLOP DOWN on the floor.
He passes out.
SYDNEY (CONT'D)
He'll be alright. He didn't go all
the way. When you fall asleep or
pass out, a Z almost always reverts
back. It's called a Nocturnal
Remission.
Keenan approaches Luke, then steps back.
SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Oh, relax, it's not contagious.
Keenan grabs the bourbon-Darvon concoction from Sydney, wipes
the rim of the bottle just in case, then takes a big swig.
A deserted, hilltop cemetery. Luke sits on the manicured
lawn, across from a gravestone with vestigial images of
brightly colored smiley-faces and fish.
LUKE
Michelle. And I really like her,
dad. But,...
He bounces a soccer ball against the headstone.
LUKE (CONT'D)
You know, I always thought your
dying was the worst thing that ever
happened to me, and that happened
more to you than it did to me... I
mean, a lot more, really.
Luke paces nervously.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Look, every day I wish you were
around, but I swear, if I tell you
this, you damn well better stay
dead!
He glances at a burial ceremony, half-mile away.
LUKE (CONT'D)
And I swear to God I'm gonna' beat
this thing. No matter what it
takes. Before I tell you, I just
want to make sure you know that,
okay?
A hushed voice...
LUKE (CONT'D)
I think I might be a Zerophiliac.
37.
Keenan and Luke spar on roller blades, hockey sticks in hand.
Luke WHACKS the hockey puck with such intensity, it may land
on Mars.
LUKE
I'm not doin' it. I don't care
what she says! I can control this
thing.
KEENAN
How?
LUKE
I didn't know what was goin' on
before. I do now, so, it's not
gonna' be a problem. I just need
to stay focused!
KEENAN
You mean, keep yourself from
getting turned on? How're you
gonna' do that? You get turned on
by two scoops of ice cream.
Luke glares at him.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
I'm just sayin'. I mean, you think
Larissa, the horse-faced girl's got
her good points.
Michelle and Janine ride up on their bikes.
JANINE
I knew we'd find 'em here.
MICHELLE
We just wanted to know if you're
alright. After last night.
LUKE
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Thanks.
Perfect.
MICHELLE
Good.
(slightly suggestive)
Good.
Luke smiles, his face REDDENS.
38.
MICHELLE (CONT'D)
I had a really good.
LUKE
Me too.
Luke smiles, nods, followed by a look of PANIC.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Will you excuse me a sec'?
He ducks away.
JANINE
What is goin' on?!
KEENAN
We just need to be alone.
We got
a big game tomorrow. Sometimes
guys just need to hang with the
guys, you know? No distractions?
Janine gives him a look of "What the hell are you talkin'
about?"
Keenan stares back, PLEADING.
Janine relents, despite herself.
JANINE
C'mon, Michelle. Let the boys play
with their pucks.
BEHIND STACKS OF LUMBER
Luke leans against the logs, wipes sweat from his brow, and
realizes...
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING AGAIN.
Panicked, he grabs his crotch, feels it,
Everything's normal.
Or is it?
He frantically unbuttons his shirt and peers inside,...
He slumps back against the logs,
WAVES OF RELIEF.
39.
Sydney makes her way through a barbed-wire fence, past a "No
Trespassing" sign. A lone DOG HOWLS in the distance.
Life-size replicas of Greek Gods, Venus and David, all face
one way in the mist. Their cold stone bodies press up
against each other; nude, indifferent.
A figure peers out between the statues in a long black coat,
a baseball cap over his eyes: Luke.
51.
SYDNEY
What are we doing here?
LUKE
Didn't want anyone around.
So, I
did what you said.
SYDNEY
Amazing, huh?
LUKE
Weird.
Awful.
SYDNEY
Hmm. Was it difficult making the
switch?
LUKE
No. It was hard gettin' back.
I
need an owner's manual.
Sydney smiles, nods in agreement.
SYDNEY
A lot of guys could use one of
those.
LUKE
So, what now? Do I take pills or
something?
SYDNEY
No, it doesn't work like that.
This may sound odd, but I need to
know if you're attracted to me.
LUKE
What?
No.
SYDNEY
Hmm.
You're not gay, are you?
LUKE
NO! Jeez! I'm just not attracted
to you like that.
SYDNEY
Okay, calm down. This could be a
problem. Right now, you can go
either way anytime you want. It's
a very special and critical time
for a Z, something you'll
experience only once in life.
52.
LUKE
Good.
SYDNEY
You need to use this incredible
opportunity you've been given, to
figure out which you're supposed to
be: male or female.
LUKE
What?
SYDNEY
Don't you see? You get to choose.
LUKE
I don't want to choose.
I want to
be a guy.
SYDNEY
Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes
your desires can conflict with your
desires. It's important to know
for sure.
LUKE
Believe me, I know.
SYDNEY
I think you need to try again.
LUKE
No way!
SYDNEY
Why're you so resistant? If the
truth is, you want to be a guy,
great, but if not...
LUKE
Don't even say that!
SYDNEY
Well, clearly some part of you
feels differently. You couldn't
change if you didn't want to.
LUKE
What?!
That's crap!
53.
SYDNEY
That's the thing about the truth.
It'll set you free, but first it
can really piss you off.
Sydney moves to leave.
LUKE
This is nuts! I'm supposed to be a
guy!
SYDNEY
Then what's the problem?
You are
one.
Sydney turns to leave.
LUKE
You're not gonna' help?!
SYDNEY
I will, the moment you're ready to
try again. You can come back to my
place right now if you want.
LUKE
Forget it!
Bikes and SUV's outside the shut down mill.
Abandoned timber
surrounds an asphalt clearing.
Luke, Keenan, Chad, Jeremy, and OTHER GUYS in the midst of a
friendly, if brutal roller hockey game.
Luke glances over and spots Max high up on a pile of logs,
cheering them on.
Jeremy passes the puck off to Luke who drives it MANIACALLY
to score the winning GOAL.
The Guys CHEER.
CHAD
Well, ain't we a basket a'
biscuits?
JEREMY
Yeah, Luke, what got into you
today?
54.
LUKE
The Force.
AFTER THE GAME
The guys gather up their belongings near the cars.
Luke sits on the running board of his truck, unlacing his
skates.
Max comes over.
MAX
Hey.
Good game.
LUKE
Yeah.
MAX
I dropped by your place. Any chance
you could give me a few pointers.
LUKE
Me?
MAX
You're awesome out there. And
according to my sister, you walk on
water.
Luke grunts, a smile.
MAX (CONT'D)
Truth is, I uh, met your cousin.
Luca.
LUKE
Oh.
Yeah?
MAX
You both have practically the same
name?
LUKE
We were both named after our Uncle.
Locasto.
MAX
Well, she's cool. Actually, she's
hot. I was hopin' maybe you could
hook me up.
55.
LUKE
Huh?
No.
Not a chance.
MAX
Boyfriend?
LUKE
No! She just wouldn't be
interested!
MAX
She a Lesbian?
LUKE
No! Of course not.
Jesus!
She's,
-my cousin!
MAX
Yeah, okay. So? Michelle's my
sister. You gonna' tell me you
wouldn't like to do her?!
LUKE
FUCK YOU, man!
Luke SHOVES Max, who SHOVES him right back.
MAX
What is your deal?!
LUKE
You ASSHOLE!
Luke lunges for him.
They go at it, wrestling FIERCELY.
Max gets the upper hand, and pins Luke down to the ground.
Luke surges with RAGE, breaks free. Grit teeth, ripped
clothes, they roll on top of each other, two rabid pitbulls.
Keenan and the Other Guys rush in, pulling them apart.
MAX
Keep the fuck away from me!
And
Michelle too!
LUKE
You can fuck off!
CHAD
What the hell's goin' on?!
56.
KEENAN
(to the guys)
Luke's datin' his sister.
VARIOUS GUYS
(recognition)
Aaaah!
LUKE
Oh, you can all fuck off!
Luke breaks free of the guys, and moves off.
Luke sits, waiting on the steps of a campus dormitory.
Janine approaches, grinning, carrying a box tied with a bow.
Keenan trails behind, straddling his bike.
LUKE
What's this all about?
Janine hands him the box.
60.
Keenan sneers, cringes.
JANINE
It's just a little something we
thought you might want.
Luke opens it, pulls out a BLUE DRESS.
LUKE
What the hell is this for?
KEENAN
(elated)
I told her.
(to Janine)
I told ya'. What a stupid ass
idea!
JANINE
Keen! Don't! We just want you to
know, whatever you decide, it's all
right with us.
LUKE
Decide?! WHAT?! No, it's not!
Get this thing away from me! JUDAS
PRIEST!
Luke HURLS the box out to the curb.
Keenan gives him a
thumbs up!
KEENAN
Sorry, man. Think she wishes
everyone was female.
JANINE
What's that s'posed to mean?
KEENAN
Oh, Christ, Janine! It means he
doesn't want to be girl!
Like
he'd have to think about THAT!
JANINE
There happen to be millions of us
out there that like being female!
LUKE
Well, bully for YOU!
Janine walks over to pick up the box.
61.
JANINE
NO! I want to know! Just exactly
what's wrong with being a girl?!
LUKE
Nothin'! It's great!
It's
fuckin' PHENOMENAL, if you happen
to BE one!
JANINE
Maybe we should've had this
conversation the other afternoon?!
LUKE
That wasn't my choice!
JANINE
I sure as hell didn't make you do
it!
KEENAN
Janine, will you just let me talk
to him for a sec'?
JANINE
Oh, what?! It's a 'GUY THING?!'
Give me a fuckin' break!
Janine storms off with the box.
KEENAN
Sorry, man. She talked me into it.
You know Janine.
Keenan picks up his bike, gets on.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
Look, uh,... you do like bein' a
dude, right?
LUKE
Asshole!
Keenan GRINS, rides off.
KEENAN
(calling back)
You should thank me.
The one she
picked out was PINK!
62.
UP THE WALKWAY
Luke passes a sidewalk trash can and notices the gift box
mangled inside.
Glancing around to make sure no one's watching, he pulls the
dress out, brushes off some dirt.
He shoves it back in the trash, stares at it.
The Semi Truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt.
From inside the cab, the blue dress flips over the rolled
down window.
ACROSS THE PARKING LOT
Keenan leans against a tractor, rolls his eyes, and twists
open another beer, which he gulps.
AT THE TRUCK
Luke hops down from the truck cab wearing Langford U. sweats
and a T-shirt.
Keenan sits on the running board.
72.
KEENAN
I mean, what the FUCK is goin' on?!
You do wanna' be a girl? You're
into guys now?
LUKE
No! I don't know exactly.
I don't
know.
Keenan downs his beer, pensive.
He crushes the can and hurls
it, SMACKING a garbage can.
KEENAN
What about Michelle?
LUKE
I had to be sure. I am now. Come
on, it's sort of a Catch-22. I
make out with a girl, I start
turning into one. You gotta'
admit, it's a little weird, isn't
it?
Suddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to Luke, Keenan
stands.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Let's get outta' here.
You want a
ride somewhere? Janine's?
KEENAN
Why don't you go see her?
Think
you're more her type.
Keenan picks up his bike.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
I'll see ya' round, okay?
LUKE
"See me around?"
Keenan shrugs.
KEENAN
Look, I'm gonna' find my own place,
okay?
This is gettin' too fuckin'
weird for me.
LUKE
I'm goin' to Dr. Catchadourian's
tonight. To make this stop.
73.
KEENAN
I don't care. I've had it with all
this crap. I mean, you gonna'
start hittin' on me next?
LUKE
Yeah, that's right Keenan, you and
me: let's do it.
Keenan rides off, leaving Luke shell-shocked.
The truck THUNDERS along through the trees, head lamps
BLAZING, dashboard lights bright.
Keenan's at the wheel.
LUCA
Janine said he's definitely there.
79.
KEENAN
Did she mention me?
Luca indicates 'no.'
KEENAN (CONT'D)
Women. God, I'm glad you want to
be a guy. You are absolutely sure,
right?
LUCA
Yes!
KEENAN
'Cause it really is totally cool
either way.
LUCA
I'm SURE.
KEENAN
Okay, I just don't want you to
think I'm zerophobic, or somethin'.
Students gather outside the farmhouse pool hall.
Male Sydney spots his prey, and approaches Jeremy, who hangs
out alone on the grass near a small bonfire.
The firelight licks their faces.
MALE SYDNEY
You're on the wrestling team.
JEREMY
Yeah.
You catch the meets?
MALE SYDNEY
Just an educated guess.
Wanna'
wrestle?
Jeremy LAUGHS, glances around, unsure what to make of him.
INSIDE THE SEMI
The truck CAREENS around a CURVE.
LUCA
Can't this thing go any faster?!
80.
Luca considers...
LUCA (CONT'D)
You know me better than anyone.
What do you think?
KEENAN
Huh?
LUCA
I mean, if I weren't a hundred
percent sure which I'm s'posed to
be. If you had to say.
KEENAN
All I know is, every time you look
at Michelle, or think about her,
you smile. What the hell else do
you need to know?
LUCA
It's not right. She deserves to be
with a normal guy.
KEENAN
So, you don't get to be with
anyone?
They drive in silence.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
That why they call it "zero-
philia?"
LUCA
She's not gonna' want some guy who
thinks maybe he's supposed to be a
girl sometimes.
KEENAN
How do you know? Did you ask?
LUCA
No way I'm gonna' ask her that.
KEENAN
Well, you have to.
Where are your
nads, man?!
Luca glares at him.
Keenan realizes his mistake...
KEENAN (CONT'D)
We'll get 'em back.
81.
The truck ROARS on.
As Janine looks on, Male Sydney moves in for the kill.
MALE SYDNEY
Come on, let's grab a couple beers.
Sydney tugs at his T-shirt.
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Of course, I see you brought your
own six-pack.
GRAVEL PARKING LOT
Keenan and Luca hop down from Luke's truck, scanning the
crowd.
Janine waves to Luca and points across the way.
Luca nods.
LUCA
Let's go!
KEENAN
Jeez.
She won't even look at me.
They stride across the field.
BEHIND THE BARN
Male Sydney shoves Jeremy passionately against the wall.
MALE SYDNEY
I do love to mess with Texas.
Keenan and Luca appear around the corner.
LUCA
There!
MALE SYDNEY
We better get outta' here.
Keenan reaches them first.
He wrenches Male Sydney and
Jeremy apart.
82.
JEREMY
Keenan?!
It's not the way it
looks.
KEENAN
Oh, Jeremy, I so profoundly don't
care if you're queer. Trust me,
around here, that's nothin'!
Luca catches up and TACKLES Male Sydney, throttling him on
the ground.
LUCA
You son-of-a-bitch!
We're doin' it
again, right now!
JEREMY
Jeez.
She your wife?!
MALE SYDNEY
No!
She just said, she wants sex!
(to Luca)
I can't. I'm sorry.
LUCA
"Sorry?!"
Fuck you!
FUCK ME!
NOW!
MALE SYDNEY
It won't work.
LUCA
We're goin' inside right here!
MALE SYDNEY
I'll scream rape.
LUCA
So will I.
They pull Male Sydney toward the barn door.
MALE SYDNEY
But I'm gay!
LUCA
So what?
MALE SYDNEY
We both need to be into it, or
nothing happens.
83.
KEENAN
Such bullshit.
Jeremy moves off, wide-eyed and disturbed.
MALE SYDNEY
That's why I became a woman in the
first place. I couldn't handle it.
Figured if I was female, it was
okay to like guys.
KEENAN
She's lyin'.
Male Sydney shakes his head 'no.'
LUCA
You're tellin' me, 'cause you're
straight as a girl and I'm straight
as a guy, we can screw and switch,
but...
MALE SYDNEY
'cause you're straight as a girl,
and I'm gay as a guy, even if we do
it...
LUCA
I'm just screwed.
Keenan's confused...
KEENAN
Jeez. You need trigonometry to
figure this thing out. Maybe
you're 'bi.'
MALE SYDNEY
In my world the Kinsey scale's
three-dimensional, but trust me,
girls do nothing for me. Zilch!
(to Keenan)
You, on the other hand...
Keenan RECOILS.
LUCA
What am I gonna' do?
KEENAN
What if he's lying?
I say, do him
again anyway!
84.
LUCA
Fine!
MALE SYDNEY
Fine.
Waste of time.
Luca notices Michelle standing nearby.
LUCA
Michelle.
KEENAN
Oh, man.
LUCA
It's not what you think.
Keenan and Luca realize that she's Luca right now, not Luke.
KEENAN
What does she think?
LUCA
I'm not sure.
MICHELLE
You asshole!
Michelle moves off.
ALONGSIDE THE BARN
Luca runs up.
MICHELLE
I don't believe this.
You slept
with that guy?!
LUCA
It's not what you think.
MICHELLE
Oh, please! What about Max?
LUCA
What about him?
MICHELLE
Don't you care about him at all?!
LUCA
Not like that: I'm straight!
I'm
attracted to you!
85.
MICHELLE
Oh, who cares, you idiot! And
sorry to break it to you, but I'm
straight too.
LUCA
No. This'll sound crazy, but I'm
not who you think I am-
MICHELLE
Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca: I know who
you are!
Luca stares, stunned.
LUCA
You know I'm a Zerophiliac?!
MICHELLE
Yes! So you can just go fuck
yourself. -Literally!
LUCA
Does Max know who I am?
MICHELLE
What if he does? Do you?
LUCA
He's a guy!
MICHELLE
And you're a girl!
LUCA
I'm not!
Michelle gestures "Oh really?!"
LUCA (CONT'D)
I'm not supposed to be!
MICHELLE
There's no supposed to be anything,
you just ARE!
LUCA
Is that what you think?!
NO!
86.
MICHELLE
Well, then congratulations! You're
a guy, just like every other guy I
ever met! I can't believe you
slept with him!
LUCA
He was a woman! I was tricked.
I
didn't know I'd switch.
Michelle stares, incredulous.
MICHELLE
You're gonna' tell me he's a Z
too?! Both of you?!
LUCA
Yes!
MICHELLE
Well, that's just perfect. What,
is there something in the water
around here?!
LUCA
She told me it would make it stop.
That it would keep me from turning
into a girl.
MICHELLE
So what?! Why's that so important
to you?! There's no way this was
gonna' work.
LUCA
Because I'm a Zerophiliac.
MICHELLE
Because you can't stand being one!
Bye, Luca.
LUCA
(correcting her)
Luke.
She glances back, sad and angry.
Luca watches her go, distraught, and then RUNS...
ATOP A GRASSY HILLSIDE
Luca collapses on the ground, overlooking Polly Wog's.
87.
Janine and Keenan run up, a few yards behind. They sit
nearby, catching their breath, unsure what to say.
Luca gazes up at the moon.
LUCA (CONT'D)
What's it like? To really make
love?
They all three gaze up at the moon.
Keenan steals a glance at Janine.
KEENAN
The best part's just lyin' there
after. Really close, really far
away.
JANINE
Like goin' to the moon, maybe.
KEENAN
Yeah. ...They should open a pizza
joint up there.
Janine glares at him, and Keenan winces.
LUCA
What am I gonna' do?
KEENAN
Maybe being a woman'll turn out
okay. Like being an elevated
member of the male species.
JANINE
Elevated "member?"
KEENAN
I just mean, maybe he'll learn to
like it.
JANINE
(sarcastic, to Keenan)
As hard as that is to conceive!
LUCA
Shut up! Both of you! What, you
want a written guarantee? You're
so damn lucky! You're into him,
he's into you. Super-glue! What
the hell else do you need to know?
88.
Janine looks to Keenan with a look of remorse, hopeful...
KEENAN
I think you're the female half of
me.
JANINE
I think you're the macho half of
me.
They kiss.
LUCA
And I don't know what half of who
the hell I am.
They look to Luca surprised,...
then all three bust out LAUGHING.
JANINE
What are you gonna' do?
LUCA
I don't know. I prefer being a
guy, but I'm a girl? I'm attracted
to Max, but I'm in love with
Michelle? It's like I'm s'posed to
be both.
Her own admission surprises her.
LUCA (CONT'D)
Not too practical. But at least
now I know.
She almost laughs, sad, but relieved.
Max slides out from under an old car. Seeing Luca, he
hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag.
LUCA
Hey.
MAX
Hey.
LUCA
I know she doesn't want to talk to
me. But do you know where I can
find her?
MAX
New York.
Left two days ago.
LUCA
Oh, man.
...You're staying?
MAX
Just 'til Friday.
Max returns to his work.
LUCA
I wanted to apologize to her.
Forget it, I don't know,...
Obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be
with me and her, but I just wish
she knew how much I, -and that I
wasn't cheating, I was just trying
to be a man for her.
(laughs)
She'd have a field day with that
one, huh?
MAX
True.
91.
LUCA
If you talk to her, please just
tell her, I'm sorry, and I wish her
the best,... everything.
MAX
Thanks.
Luca 'nods', not fully understanding Max's response.
LUCA
I'm sorry.
To you too.
MAX
For what?
LUCA
Mixed signals, I guess.
Max walks toward the back, then YELPS, wincing.
MAX
Ow!
Son-of-a-bitch!
LUCA
You all right?
MAX
Stepped on a nail.
Damn it!
Max sits on a crate, starts untying his boot.
MAX (CONT'D)
So, you gettin' used to this at
all?
LUCA
I wish.
MAX
You definitely had me confused.
LUCA
For whatever it's worth.
I think
you're a pretty hot guy.
MAX
Thanks.
But you're not interested?
LUCA
Truth is, I am. And I guess it
sounds crazy, but I couldn't do
that to Michelle.
92.
Luca moves off, as Max removes his boot, and his sock.
MAX
For whatever it's worth, I think
you're pretty hot too.
LUCA
Thanks.
MAX
Too bad you're a moron.
LUCA
Excuse me?
MAX
I have incontrovertible proof.
Luca stares at Max, and then down at his ankle, at the TATTOO
OF A GREEN BIRD.
Max meets her eyes,
and it finally dawns on Luca,
standing, in shock, and now putting it all together,
she LUNGES for him, nailing him to the ground, kissing him.
She RIPS Max's T-shirt as they fall to the asphalt, knocking
over oil cans.
Passion.
Unbridled.
IN THE PARTS YARD
Luca manhandles Max, shoving him against a pile of huge
tires, as Max's face transforms...
BY OLD RADIATORS
Michelle slams back onto the crabgrass. She pulls Luca
toward her as Luca's face transforms into Luke.
BY DISCARDED TRUCK CHASSIS
Luke and Michelle roll on the crabgrass, kissing,
TRANSFORMING as they roll, into Luca and Max and Michelle and
Luke and Luca -or was that Max?
93.
