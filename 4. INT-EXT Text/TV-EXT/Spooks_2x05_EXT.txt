 
A white furniture van with a sign on it -  Pluto Removals  -is 
being filmed at a distance. It is parked in an area of lock-up 
garages. 
 
Figures are unloading drums from the lock-up and putting them 
into the furniture van. 
 
                                  VOICE (RUTH) 
            These are members of a group calling itself 
          Patmos.  Ideology: survivalist. The lock-up seen 
          here was inspected by Special Branch. The drums 
        seen here were empty. The van has been left parked 
        in an East End car park for the last forty-eight 
                    hours. Level of Threat: Blue, A/B 
 
 
Again a hand-held camera. 
 
A Caucasian male is stopped, overpowered and deftly pulled 
into a van, the doors close and the van pulls off. And... 
 
 
Figures training with weapons in woodland and scrub, mountains 
behind. 
 
                                        VOICE 
        These pictures were taken in the Brecon Beacons of 
        an animal rights group believed to be planning an 
                armed attack. Target is suspected to be 
            laboratories in Bristol. Level of Threat: Blue 
                                        A/B. 
 
 
A CCTV Camera looks at the traffic crossing on the north side 
of the bridge.

Morning rush hour: traffic is jammed on the bridge and along 
the north embankment. The buses are full, people hurry along 
the pavements. Busy, crowded London. Focus on a figure 
crossing the bridge, walking towards camera - it s TOM. 
 
 
TOM walks down the steps of Hungerford bridge, then the camera 
zooms towards a coffee shop. The window is misted. GO CLOSER. 
 
A hand wipes a circle in the misted window and we see a POV 
from inside of TOM approaching. REVERSE: to see the person 
looking out is VICKY. 
 
 
 
VICKY is walking along amongst the London crowds. A normal 
day. 
 
CUT BETWEEN: TOM on the Grid, VICKY on the Embankment. 
 
                                        VICKY 
                And where the hell were you yesterday? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  I was held up. 
 
                                        VICKY 
                          Couldn t you have phoned? 
 
                                        TOM 
                            Not from where I was. 
 
                                        VICKY 
        I sat in that restaurant and they looked. People 
            looked at me. I had a big sign over my head 
                                     Jilted.    
 
                                        TOM 
                  I had a big sign over my head too. 
 
                                        VICKY 
                              And what was that?

TOM puts his hand over the phone so she cannot hear. 
 
                                        TOM 
          End of the world, end of the world, end of the 
                                        world. 
 
                                VICKY (ON PHONE) 
                          Tom? Tom are you there? 
 
TOM is suddenly gripped by anger. Cold. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              What did you have? 
 
                                        VICKY 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TOM 
                      For lunch what did you have? 
 
                                        VICKY 
                            Er... a salmon mousse. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    A salmon mousse. A salmon mousse. 
 
                                        VICKY 
          What s the matter with you? My life s in ruins 
        because of you. I mean what about me, you selfish 
                                      bastard? 
 
And he goes hot with anger: 
 
                                        TOM 
            Well what about you Vicky? Sitting in a posh 
          French restaurant in the middle of the Western 
        world, thinking  this is the worst thing that can 
        happen to me... . Me, me, me... Why are we all so 
          self-obsessed? Do you know I almost see the point 
          of covering all the salmon mousses with green 
                                        slime.

EMBANKMENT: 
 
VICKY stands still, in shock, phone in hand. 
 
                              TOM (V.O.) (cont d) 
                                        Vicky? 
 
VICKY hangs up. 
 
THE GRID: 
TOM looks at what is now a developing party. DANNY puts a 
plastic cup into TOM s hand. 
 
                                        HARRY 
        Let s down these and off to a liquid lunch at the 
                                      George?

MONITOR: GCHQ RED A/A WARNING: LIKELY ATTACK IN 24 HOURS.
