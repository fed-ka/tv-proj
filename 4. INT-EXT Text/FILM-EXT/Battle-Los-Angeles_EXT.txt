The SOUND is at a frantic pitch here-- The sound of CHAOS on
the streets. People SCREAMING, CAR HORNS BLARING as CARS
jockey for position, moving eastward among...
HORDES OF PEOPLE on foot, their PANICKED FACES rushing past.
SUPER: LOS ANGELES-- CONTACT + 1 HOUR as we...
CUT TO:
Correggio, GOLF CLUB in hand, steps to a golf tee. WHACK.
He tees off.
The marines follow the ball as it sails into the darkness.
CPL. CORREGGIO -
That's more like it.
PVT. LENIHAN, 18, baby-faced, looks impressed.
PVT. LENIHAN
Sweet.
PVT. IMLAY, 19, a dense but good-natured country boy, moves
to the tee.
PVT. IMLAY
Don't encourage him. Correggio's
freakin' ego's big enough already.
He takes the club from Correggio.
PVT. IMLAY
Let an expert show you how it's
done, bro.
Imlay TEES OFF, his swing plainly choppy, uncoordinated.
POV THROUGH IMLAY'S NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
As he WHACKS THE BALL, visible in the night vision's greenish
glow. It HOOKS into a sand trap.
PVT. IMLAY (O.S.)
Mother fu...
4.
Then he stops as a LIGHT flashes beyond the trees.
PVT. IMLAY
Foot mobiles. 3 O'clock.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Told you they'd come!
THREE GIRLS, 19-21, signal with a FLASHLIGHT. Then race down
a small hill onto the golf course.
The THREE GIRLS sit around a beat-up TAHOE parked near the
tee, CASE OF BEER on its back gate, sipping beers.
Corpsman ADUKWU, 20, a tall, thin Nigerian, TEES OFF.
PVT. IMLAY
That dog'll hunt! Damn, Daktari,
you can play!
ADUKWU
(THICK ACCENT)
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.
PVT. IMLAY
Well, how would I know? I mean,
it's an American game.
PVT. LENIHAN
Actually, Imlay, it's Scottish.
PVT. KERNS, 19, an antsy fireplug of a guy, shakes his head.
PVT. KERNS
Lenihan, you as good with an M-16
as you are with your mouth?
PVT. IMLAY
Kerns. Lay off him.
PVT. KERNS
What? Just wanna make sure the
rookie won't fold under fire.
Correggio shoves a beer into Kerns' hand.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Relax, dude.
He throws an arm around Kerns' shoulder, smiles at the girls.
5.
CPL. CORREGGIO
My buddy's jumpy 'cause he got an
assfull a' shrapnel our last tour.
PVT. KERNS
I'm jumpy? You're crawling up your
own ass 'cause we train with Sgt.
Nantz tomorrow.
Correggio eyes Kerns. This was the wrong thing to say.
One girl, smiling seductively, steps to Correggio, takes the
golf club.from him.
GIRL #1
If this is the officer's course,
what happens if they catch you out
here?
She readies to take a shot. Correggio snuggles up behind
her, ostensibly teaching her how to swing.
CPL. CORREGGIO
We can handle it, baby. We're
experts at night maneuvers.
Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu.
GIRL #2
So you're from where again?
Imlay pops a beer, interrupting.
PVT. IMLAY
Nigeria. Adukwu's our corpsman.
Like a medic. Saved Kerns' ass.
(TO ADUKWU)
Daktari, tell her about Nigeria.
Adukwu starts to talk, but Imlay interrupts again:
PVT. IMLAY
Adukwu's a green card marine...
(motions to Lenihan)
And Lenihan here-- He's just green.
Mom signed so he could join at 17.
I'm looking after him since he
don't know his ass from a hot rock.
Lenihan suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up.
GIRL #3
You're doing a good job.
6.
PVT. IMLAY
Yeah. We always take the new meat
out here to christen 'em...
Lenihan shuffles back out from behind the Tahoe.
PVT. IMLAY
Hey, barfy. Grab your beer.
toast.
Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly.
PVT. IMLAY
To Lenihan. Who gets his first
taste a' those hills tomorrow.
He points off to the HILLY, DESOLATE TERRAIN near the course.
PVT. KERNS
Good luck, rookie.
The marines chuckle knowingly, about to drink...
Then they hear the sound of TIRES skidding to a halt. They
look toward the hillside, see the WHITE HELMETS'of MPs.
CPL. CORREGGIO
MPs!
The marines grab the goggles and clubs, pile...
INTO THE TAHOE
With the girls. The Tahoe skids away, the beer CRASHING off'
the back. The first girl eyes Correggio.
GIRL #1
Experts, huh?
Correggio grins sheepishly. She smiles. sweetly, taking his
hand, writing her PHONE NUMBER on the back of it as...
Martinez, in uniform now, exits the ground-floor apartment,
heads to HIS CAR as Anna exits, watching him go, smiling.
ANNA
Call me later.
LT. MARTINEZ
(SIMULTANEOUS)
I'll call you later.
He stops, smiling back at her now. She waves coyly.
Then Martinez is RUNNING BACK TO THE APARTMENT.
Moving with the grace of the college football player he was
just a few years ago.
We don't go with him. Just observe from a distanceas...
Martinez arrives at Anna, who laughs as he leans down,
kissing her stomach now.
The 1st PLATOON of the 2/5, 39 marines, all 18-23 years old,
sweating as they RUN HILLS in FULL GEAR in the blazing sun.
Key on the MARINES FROM THE GOLF COURSE, staring forward
at... Nantz, running up ahead.
PVT. KERNS
Heard Nantz put in his papers.
He's out.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Good. Wish he done it years ago.
Lenihan, struggling, breathing hard, looks up at this,
STUMBLING as he does.
Nantz, looking back at the chatter, sees...
Imlay grab hold of Lenihan, helping him forward now.
SGT. NANTZ
Goddamn it, Imlay, you gonna wipe
his ass for him, too? Every man
carries his weight!
Nantz drops back, runs alongside the struggling Lenihan.
SGT. NANTZ
Just quit, Lenihan. Do us all a
favor. 'Cause the squad's only as
strong as the weakest man.,..
Lenihan STUMBLES and FALLS IN THE DIRT.
SGT. NANTZ
And right now you're getting us all
killed. You hear?
On these words, NANTZ MEETS EYES WITH CORREGGIO, further back
in the pack. Nantz looks away, sees...
Imlay, suddenly at Lenihan's side, helping him up. Nantz
shoves Imlay away, knocking him onto his ass.
9.
SGT. NANTZ
You think you're helping him,
Imlay!? You think you're making
him stronger?!
Nantz puts a boot into Imlay's chest, shoving him flat.
Correggio stares at this, steaming.
SGT. NANTZ
Stay on the goddamn ground, Imlay!
You've just been gut-shot.
(TO LENIHAN)
Your buddy's down, bleeding to
death, Lenihan. LZ's at the top of
this hill. You gonna let this man
die in the dirt on some stinking
hill? Or are you marine enough to
save him?!
Lenihan stumbles to his feet, wiping dirt from his mouth.
PVT. LENIHAN
I'm gonna save him, sir!
Lenihan bends, strains, somehow heaves Imlay up.
He begins STUMBLING UP THE HILL, carrying Imlay on his back.
SGT. NANTZ
Come on, goddamnit! It's a hot LZ!
The chopper's gotta move! They're
gonna leave you BOTH to die!!!
Lenihan staggers, knees trembling, weaving back and forth.
Then his foot comes down on a ROCK IN THE TRAIL. His ANKLE
GIVES WAY. Lenihan falls, yells in pain, grabbing his ankle.
SGT. NANTZ
GET UP!!!
PVT. LENIHAN
I can't.
SGT. NANTZ
Don't you ever tell me you can't!
Correggio takes a step towards Nantz now. Kerns stops him.
CPL. CORREGGIO
He's injured, Sergeant.
10.
A moment as they stare at each other. Nantz, voice like ice:
SGT. NANTZ
He's not injured. He twisted his
goddamn ankle.
Nantz' looks over the men, sweaty, covered with grime.
SGT. NANTZ
We are marines. "Can't" is not the
code we live by. "Can't" gets
marines killed. Do things the
right way, the marine way, maybe
you get to come home... Maybe your
buddy gets to come home.
Correggio stares back sullenly on this.
SGT. NANTZ
Dying's easy, ladies. Everything
else takes balls.
Nantz spits on the ground.
SGT. NANTZ
Adukwu. Run a bag of saline into
Lenihan and tape that ankle. We
start back in ten minutes.
Two surfers-- CPL. GRAYSTON, 23, looking grizzled beyond his
years, and PVT. SIMMONS, a spaced-out surfer vibe, sit on
boards in the water, staring at...
TWO MPs, on the beach, waving them in.
PVT. SIMMONS
I don't know why they always have
to give us shit. It's not fair.
CPL. GRAYSTON
Question is, why does everybody
think life's supposed to be fair?
Why do bad guys want to kill us?
Why can't I have a nipple ring?
Why is it the more power we get,
the more we want? Nothing's fair,
Simmons.
PVT. SIMMONS
(SMILES)
Whatever, Corporal. I just like to
blow shit up.
Suddenly, a SIREN begins WAILING from the base. Grayston and
Simmons exchange a glance. They start paddling in quickly.
Nantz is running with another platoon of MARINES. Everyone
slows as the SIRENS WAIL from the base.
13.
SGT. NANTZ
Hold.
The squad stops, following Nantz' gaze to...
An approaching dust cloud, being kicked up by...
A HUMVEE and TWO FIVE-TON TRUCKS
Speeding up the dirt road toward the marines.
Everyone is silent as they watch the HUMVEE and TRUCKS pull
up... This is not normal.
1st Sergeant Roy hops from the Humvee, shouting:
1ST SGT. ROY
Marines! Into the trucks. Now.
Proceed to the armory and draw
weapons.
The marines exchange glances, heading for the five-tons.
Roy motions to Nantz, who follows him to the Humvee.
SGT. NANTZ
What's going on, John?
1ST SGT. ROY
Look, Mike, I know you're burnt
out, ready to move on... Whatever
you want to call it. But
everybody's being deployed right
now. And the platoon's down a
sergeant. We need you.
SGT. NANTZ
For what? Do I have a choice here?
They arrive at the Humvee. Roy turns to Nantz.
1ST SGT. ROY
No. You don't. It's all hands on
deck, Mike.
Nantz nods, resigned. Starts climbing into the Humvee.
SGT. NANTZ
Just don't lose my paperwork.
14.
The Humvee and five-tons swing into the base past a mass of
activity: TRUCKS being loaded with supplies, TANKS driving
onto flat cars, MARINES racing about.
All activity has doubled, a frantic energy now. TRUCKS race
along the perimeter of the air field, massive CH-46
HELICOPTERS TAKE OFF loaded with MARINE UNITS...
The 1st platoon stands together, Lt. Martinez addressing them
as ANOTHER CH-46 HELICOPTER is landing nearby.
20.
LT. MARTINEZ
As you probably heard, Sgt. Nantz
will be taking over for Sgt. Beck.
We're lucky to have him aboard.
The CH-46 helicopters TOUCHES DOWN now, its massive,, bay door
opening for them. Martinez barks:
LT. MARTINEZ
Let's move, men!,
The platoon grabs gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing
aboard. Nantz hurries them along, grabbing packs, throwing
them on after the marines.
Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on...
Correggio grabs it back from Nantz.
Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio.
SGT. NANTZ
You got something to get off your
chest, Corporal?
CPL. CORREGGIO
No. It's cool, Sergeant. You got
a Silver Star and my brother came
home in a box. I get it.
Beat.
SGT. NANTZ
Get aboard, Corporal.
Correggio jumps into the chopper.
The airport is being quickly transformed into a military
base: MILITARY VEHICLES line the runway, more being driven
from a nearby CARGO PLANE.
The CH-46 LANDS.
The platoon JUMPS OUT, squad leaders forming the men up as...
Nantz and Martinez salute a CAPTAIN heading to them as F-18
JETS take off, screaming overhead.
LT. MARTINEZ
Lt. Martinez, sir. 1st Platoon of
the 2/5.
CAPTAIN
Situation is as follows: Most of
Santa Monica is cleared of
civilians. We've got a defensive
line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile
from the ocean...
He points out LINCOLN BOULEVARD on a MAP, the OCEAN close by.
CAPTAIN
At 9 p.m., everything from Lincoln
to the ocean will be bombed.
Martinez blanches.
LT. MARTINEZ
We're... leveling it, Captain?
CAPTAIN
We've got an infestation of god-
knows-what. It's an enemy ground
force only, they have no aircraft.
So our jets'll tear 'em a new
asshole. We will rule the air.
LT. MARTINEZ
But... there must be civilians
stuck behind the line, sir.
CAPTAIN
That's affirm. We're getting
distress calls, sending squads out.
He points to the MAP, to streets running from Lincoln Blvd.
23.
CAPTAIN
Your mission, Lieutenant, take your
1st squad, proceed west from
Lincoln to a community center
located here...
(pointing to map)
In a park on 10th and Bay Street.
Police were using it as an
evacuation point. They got
overrun. Get there, any civilians
you find, get 'em back here to the
FOB for evacuation. You got three
hours.
Another CHOPPER is LANDING. Nantz yells over the sound:
SGT. NANTZ
What do we know about these things,
Captain?
CAPTAIN
Not much. But police have shot
'em. They bleed.
The captain, hurrying to the next chopper, yells back:
CAPTAIN
It's our job to kill 'em.
Nantz and Martinez are double-timing with the 1st squad (Cpl.
Grayston, Correggio and Kerns, Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and
Lenihan, Mottola and Guerrero, Simmons and Adukwu).
As they approach Lincoln, they slow, eyes widening.
REVERSE to see what they're staring at:
LINCOLN BOULEVARD. Being fortified into a defensive line.
MARINES are setting up sand-bagged MACHINE GUN NESTS in a
parking lot fronting a nail shop and a China Express.
Other MARINES hunker behind barricades in front of a Goodyear
Tire Store, firing MORTARS toward the ocean.
RUBBLE. BURNING BUILDINGS. Smashed-in storefronts. Cars
CRASHED at intersections, the echoing WAIL of CAR ALARMS.
Pockets of CIVILIANS are being waved forward by MARINES. A
LITTLE GIRL with a Smurf backpack is rushed across Lincoln.
24.
Martinez turns, rallies the squad, most of whom look shocked.
LT. MARTINEZ
Let's go, marines! Clock's
running. Focus on the mission.
We're gonna get to that community
center and get those people safe.
A COBRA ATTACK HELICOPTER screams overhead, firing into the
distance. Martinez turns to Nantz, shouting over the din:
LT. MARTINEZ
Something to add, Sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
(to the squad)
Kill anything that's not human.
Nantz and Martinez lead the squad FROM LINCOLN onto 10th St.
Various STRUCTURE FIRES are visible in the distance.
The squad passes a FIRE TRUCK crashed against a fence, engine
idling. FIREMEN lie near their hose lines, dead.
Suddenly... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Deep, deafening sounds
exploding in the distance.
The ground SHAKES from massive AFTERSHOCKS. Billowing SMOKE
rumbles from the west. Ash rains,down, the sky turns black.
The squad hunkers down, panicked looks exchanged.
PVT. KERNS
What the hell is that?!
LT. MARTINEZ
Keep it together. Watch your
angles.
The aftershocks fade. Ominous quiet again.
The squad continues DOWN THE STREET.
CPL. HARRIS
Helluva way to get citizenship, eh,
Daktari?
ADUKWU
Shit, I'd rather be in Afghanistan.
25.
THICK SMOKE hangs in the air. The lack of visibility is
clearly adding to the marines' fright.
Numerous SHAPES become visible in the smoke.
As the squad approaches slowly, the shapes become clear...
BODIES splayed in the street.
CPL. HARRIS
Cherise and I were supposed to
register at Bed, Bath & Beyond
tonight...
CPL. STAVROU
Think you're gonna be busy, bro.
Nantz points his rifle into a CRASHED PICKUP TRUCK. A BODY
is slumped beneath the wheel.
Simmons comes up behind Nantz. Peers into the truck:
Sections of the BODY appear almost dissolved by a white
phosphorous-like substance.
PVT. SIMMONS
What is that shit, Sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
(caustic, dismissive)
Something bad, private. Now get
back with your team.
PVT. KERNS
Whoa, whoa... Contact! Twelve
o'clock!
A SHAPE is moving to them through the smoke.
The marines aim, about to fire just as the smoke clears...
A DOG. Standing there, staring mournfully at them.
Nervous chuckles now. Correggio sidles up to Kerns.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Relax, man.
Kerns just shoots him a look. The squad moves on.
As they approach a SIDE STREET that intersects 10th...
The DOG WHINES. Correggio pets it, trying to comfort it...
26.
But the dog suddenly RACES OFF, disappearing into the smoke.
The marines spin, rifles up, growing unnerved...
PVT. IMLAY
What the hell...?
CPL. HARRIS
Something spooked that dog...
Then Kerns sees the SMOKE SWIRLING DOWN THE SIDE STREET...
As if something is racing through it.
Kerns breaks formation, SPRINTS DOWN THE SIDE STREET, FIRING.
PVT. KERNS
Contact! Contact!
Discipline shatters as the squad follows Kerns...
DOWN THE SIDE STREET.
SGT. NANTZ
Marines! Hold your position!
Kerns stops, spinning, looking. for targets, breath ragged,
eyes panicked. Correggio races up.
CPL. CORREGGIO
What'd you see?!
Suddenly, the INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears
through the smoke, moving FAST down the side street.
Kerns is ready, FIRING. The others react, FIRING as well.
The ALIEN FORM is blasted, DROPPING into the smoke.
LT. MARTINEZ
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns' face.
SGT. NANTZ
One enemy runs and you break
discipline and chase it?!
(to the others)
Think, marines. Stay alive.
LT. MARTINEZ
The sergeant is right. Stay on
course. We have a mission...
27.
Suddenly, the SHADOWY ALIEN FORM RISES again, darting off,
disappearing into the smoke.
The squad stares back, stunned.
CPL. STAVROU
(QUIETLY)
Holy shit.
CPL. HARRIS
How many rounds it take?
CPL. STAVROU
Enough.
Correggio edges to Kerns, who's looking panicky.
CPL. CORREGGIO
You okay?
PVT. KERNS
They're real, bro. I kept prayin'
they wouldn't be...
SGT. NANTZ
Quiet.
Nantz, unnerved himself, stares into the smoke...
LT. MARTINEZ
What is it, sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
That thing running down the
street... That was to draw us in...
Slowly, fading in, we hear what Nantz hears now...
A RUMBLING SOUND BEHIND THEM. Building. Nantz spins to it.
SGT. NANTZ
They're coming. We took the bait,
now they're cutting us off.
PVT. KERNS
I can't see a goddamn thing!
But the SOUND of their ADVANCE tells us there's many.
SGT. NANTZ
Light it up!
The squad lets loose with a barrage of FIRE as...
28.
TRACER FIRE shoots back at the marines from the smoke.
Glimpses of INDISTINCT FIGURES moving fast.
LT. MARTINEZ
Mottola, get on the radio. See if
we can get some air support.
Mottola starts working the radio, trying to remain calm as.'..
PROJECTILES EXPLODE in BRIGHT FLASHES around the marines.
PVT. SIMMONS
Contact front! Contact front!
Correggio, frustrated, peers through the smoke.
CPL. CORREGGIO
What are we shooting at?!
PVT. MOTTOLA
Lieutenant. Command says air power
is totally committed. Enemy
contact all over the area...
Martinez stares back at this ominous news as...
The MARINES FIRE back into the THICK SMOKE. But the enemy
attack keeps INCREASING in ferocity.
One PROJECTILE hits a wall above Lenihan. It EXPLODES, some
kind of liquid splashing onto him. Lenihan grimaces.
PVT. LENIHAN
Ahh, shit! It's burning!
His HELMET is being eaten away by the liquid. Imlay is
immediately at Lenihan's side, pulling the helmet off.
Lenihan's skin is blistering, oozing.
PVT. LENIHAN
(PANICKED)
My face, man...! How's my face?
PVT. IMLAY
Ugly as ever, bro.
The squad hunkers down, trying to find any cover-available--
behind cars, trees.
Martinez drops BEHIND A CAR, pulls out his MAP, checking it
for escape routes.-
29.
Chaos as ENEMY TRACER FIRE increases, exploding around them.
Martinez looks desperate, forced to FLEE FROM COVER by the
alien fire.
LT. MARTINEZ
(SHOUTS)
Fall back! Here!
He leads them further down the side street.
SGT. NANTZ
We can hold this position,
Lieutenant!
LT. MARTINEZ
We're gonna get pinned down!
SGT. NANTZ
Sir, these things seem to be
operating tactically! Don't let
them dictate your decisions...
LT. MARTINEZ
(SHOUTS)
Move to live, marines!
The squad follows Martinez, retreating...
INTO A 'WALK' STREET.
JUST A SIDEWALK separates the houses opposite each other.
A moment. SILENCE. Nantz looks at the heavy FOLIAGE, dense
SHRUBS and TREES on both sides. He knows:
SGT. NANTZ
It's an ambush. This is the kill
zone!
Nantz slings his COMBAT SHOTGUN forward.
SGT. NANTZ
FIRE!
On Nantz' order, the SQUAD OPENS FIRE just as...
ALIEN FIRE EXPLODES from the THICK COVER of bushes and trees.
Nantz leads the brutal counterattack, PUMPING and FIRING his
combat SHOTGUN.
Martinez is shouting orders, directing the men as...
30.
Kerns backs against a fence, overwhelmed by the chaos. ; He
aims, shoots. Then he freezes.
Correggio steps in front of Kerns, firing to protect him.,
Lenihan takes a hit from the enemy tracer fire exploding
around the marines. He's blown back into thick bushes as...
THE REST OF THE SQUAD battles fiercely.
An alien PROJECTILE slams into Cpl. Grayston'S ARM. The
SPRAY OF LIQUID bubbles out from the wound.
Then something grabs Grayston through the bushes...
Nantz sticks his SHOTGUN into the bushes, fires. BOOM. And
Grayston is suddenly free. Nantz drags him into...
THE FRONT YARD OF A HOUSE.
The squad follows, Correggio pulling Kerns into the yard.
THEY BACK TOWARD THE HOUSE.
Guerrero, Imlay and Simmons lay down an awesome barrage with
powerful SAWS (Squad Automatic Weapon), covering.the retreat.
Trees and bushes are shredded, houses are splintered.
All this mayhem allows the squad to...
BARGE THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE.
Pandemonium. The marines are sweaty, bleeding, scared.
PVT. SIMMONS
Jesus! Oh my God!
CPL. STAVROU
Keep your shit together!
PVT. SIMMONS
What the hell are those things?!
CPL. HARRIS
They're the goddamn enemy.
PVT. IMLAY
Yeah, and there's a million of 'em!
PVT. SIMMONS
Where'd they come from?! Why'd
they come here?!
31.
LT. MARTINEZ
Everyone... just calm down.
PVT. SIMMONS
Calm down?! We keep shooting
them... Why don't they die?!
SGT. NANTZ
Stow that shit, Private.
(turns, to the others)
Watch the yard. Secure the back.
We're not dyin' here today.
The marines take up firing positions at windows and doors.
CORREGGIO EYES KERNS.
CPL. CORREGGIO
You okay?
Kerns stares back, deer in the headlights. He nods.
ADUKWU IS WRAPPING GRAYSTON'S ARM as Grayston fumbles for a
CIGARETTE. Adukwu lights it for him.
CPL. GRAYSTON
I know. These things'll kill me.
Adukwu smiles. Grayston stares at his arm, ironically:
CPL. GRAYSTON
Hell, now that just ain't fair.
Nantz moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded
Grayston and Guerrero.
SGT. NANTZ
Sir, what are your orders?
Martinez turns, stares at Nantz.
LT. MARTINEZ
I led us right into that ambush.
SGT. NANTZ
Sir. Your orders.
Beat. Martinez nods.
LT. MARTINEZ
Let's figure out how we get out of
here. We'll medevac the wounded
from that park.
32.
Nantz nods, turns to Mottola.
SGT. NANTZ
Radio the FOB. Get us a medevac at
that park by the community center.
As Mottola works the radio, he's startled to see Guerrero,
who has been SLASHED across both eyes.
PVT. GUERRERO
I can't see, Motorola.
Mottola, horrified, steadies his voice.
PVT. MOTTOLA
You'll be okay.
A slight beat. Then...
PVT. GUERRERO
You're one shitty liar, bro.
PVT. IMLAY
Hey, where the hell is Lenihan?!
Everyone stops, stares.
Lenihan, pressing a hand into his side, BLOOD oozing between
his fingers, peers INTO THE BACK YARD at...
A SWIMMING POOL, its water gently lapping. A GARAGE nearby.
Lenihan, startled by the SOUND of ALIENS RUNNING in the alley
behind the house, takes cover BY THE GARAGE.
He struggles to remain calm. Then the sound FADES. He
waits. Silence. Lenihan starts to edge,out as...
A BANG rings out on the far side of the garage.
Lenihan spins back behind cover, eyes desperately searching.
Nantz is MOVING, with Mottola and Imlay. covering.
SGT. NANTZ
(INTO RADIO)
We're coming for you, Lenihan.
What's your location?
Nantz, Mottola and Imlay moving through the thick smoke...
Nantz still trying to raise Lenihan on the radio.
SGT. NANTZ
Lenihan...? Lenihan...?
Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears. He
hears something...
The marines freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as...
Nearby, they hear SOUNDS of aliens running... Somewhere...
35.
The marines crouch, weapons up, straining to see through the
smoke. They remain stock still. Then...
The sound fades into the distance.
Nantz looks at the men. Motions. They creep forward as...
.OUT OF THE GARAGE. Lenihan staggers back, eyes darting
along the garage roof, gun aimed.
Nothing there.
As Lenihan continues backing away, peering through the
drifting smoke at the garage, he's unaware that BEHIND him...
A SHADOWY ALIEN FORM IS RISING FROM THE POOL.
Lenihan doesn't see it, but he senses it. He turns, FIRES...
A SPLASH as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back INTO THE
POOL, disappearing under the water.
Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool.
He peers over the pool edge...
An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on the bottom of the pool.
Lenihan is transfixed a moment. Then he raises his rifle to
punch more rounds into the thing as...
WHOOOM! The creature launches OUT OF THE WATER!
36.
BLISTERING GUNFIRE! As Nantz, Mottola and Imlay burst into
the yard. They fire, as does Lenihan.
The fusillade of bullets tears the creature up.
The marines STOP FIRING as the alien falls to the ground.
They stare amazed at the 7 ft. tall ALIEN CORPSE... Rigid
skeleton bursting out of its skin, some strange layer of
machinery intertwined with its flesh.
CPL. MOTTOLA
Oh my God... What the hell are
these things?
PVT. IMLAY
They're butt ugly, that's what they
are.
Nantz grabs onto Lenihan, noticing his wound.
SGT. NANTZ
We're gonna get you to the medevac,
Private.
PVT. LENIHAN
Thank you, Sergeant. Thanks for
coming for me.
SGT. NANTZ
But Lenihan...
PVT. LENIHAN
Yes, Sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
Ever get separated from your unit
again, I'll find you and shoot you
myself.
PVT. LENIHAN
Yes, Sergeant.
Imlay slings Lenihan's arm around his shoulder and they're
instantly moving, RUNNING FROM THE YARD.
The men meet up with the others. Adukwu and Kerns carrying
Grayston on a litter, Simmons holding onto the blinded
Guerrero, guiding him.
37.
LT. MARTINEZ
All right, let's get to the
community center...
They head off, Simmons still supporting Guerrero as THWACK!
An alien projectile slams INTO SIMMONS' THROAT. Choking, he
CRUMPLES to the ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless.
Panic. The marines spin, searching for targets.
LT. MARTINEZ
Move! Grab Simmons! Go, go!
Stavrou hoists Simmons as the marines run off, FIRING to
cover their retreat, as...
The SILHOUETTES of DARK ALIEN FORMS are visible on distant
rooftops, watching the rifle squad disappear down the street.
Nantz, Martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently
through the street, supporting their wounded. They take
cover behind cars, peering out to see...
The PARK in the distance. A wide open FIELD with a COMMUNITY
CENTER BUILDING on the far side.
There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems
strangely quiet.
Then, out of the smoke, an IMAGE APPEARS... Something MOVING
AT THEM...
The marines all shift, aim forward, about to blast away as...
FOUR MARINES come into view, moving ghost-like.
Nantz signals with his flashlight. The marines hurry over,
silently falling behind the cars.
LT. MARTINEZ
You guys are 2/5?
MARINE
2nd squad, 3rd platoon...
LT. MARTINEZ
Where's the rest of your unit?
MARINE
This is it, Lieutenant. Everyone
else is dead or missing.
The news hits Martinez hard. He eyes Nantz.
MARINE
We were on the street, like, ten
minutes and they ambushed us. As
soon as we radioed for help, it's
like they were everywhere...
PVT. MOTTOLA
(ON RADIO)
Medevac's incoming, lieutenant.
LT. MARTINEZ
All right. Stay with us.
And the squad moves out...
A large FIELD stretches from the street to a squat BUILDING,
the COMMUNITY CENTER.
The specter of LIGHTS is thrown onto the field, an other
worldly effect until we realize the lights are coming from...
A MEDEVAC HELICOPTER
Descending steadily, its thundering rotors whipping the air..
LT. MARTINEZ
Load the wounded. Sgt. Nantz, Cpl.
Harris-- let's find the civilians.
Martinez, Nantz and Harris run to the community center as...
The WOUNDED are hustled to the CHOPPER as it TOUCHES DOWN.
The marines run up to the chopper with the wounded. INSIDE
THE MEDEVAC they see WOUNDED laid across the helicopter's
cabin. A CREWMAN in the medevac yells over the din:
CREWMAN
You called in with two wounded!
PVT. IMLAY
We got four!
CREWMAN
Can't take four! We have no room!
CPL. STAVROU
Make goddamn room!
A beat. The crewman relents in the face of Stavrou's
impressive bulk, tries to make room.
Imlay and Stavrou get Simmons and Grayston on.
Mottola helps Guerrero in, squeezing his hand.
PVT. GUERRERO
I'll work on that mix for you.
PVT. MOTTOLA
Thanks, dude. Think I'm gonna need
it.
Lenihan crawls onto the chopper's deck with Imlay's help.
40.
PVT. IMLAY
(SMILES)
You just had to get outta the shit.
Lenihan smiles back.
CREW CHIEF
Now! We're moving now!
Imlay bumps fists with Lenihan, backs away as...
Nantz runs out with the BOY. Followed by Martinez and
Harris, hustling the two GIRLS out.
SGT. NANTZ
Wait! Stavrou, hold it! KIDS!
Stavrou tries to hold the chopper, screaming at it as...
THE MEDEVAC RISES.
Nantz, Martinez and Harris run to the chopper with the kids.
The marines around the medevac are screaming up at it, trying
to hold it, but to no avail.
The CHOPPER GAINS ALTITUDE as suddenly...
BOOM! A SHOCK WAVE OF ENERGY FIRES from the west as...
The MEDEVAC takes a DIRECT HIT.
The devastating energy wave blasts it END-OVER-END...
The massive helicopter CRASHES INTO A HOUSE blocks away,
exploding, as...
Nantz turns ominously as an unearthly BUZZING SOUND FADES IN.
LIGHTS are ADVANCING from a street leading to the field.
As the SOUND and LIGHTS BUILD, Nantz runs to the other
marines to get them off that field.
He pulls on them, urging them to the COMMUNITY CENTER doors.
They REACH THE COMMUNITY CENTER, fall into it just as...
Glowing through the heavy cover of smoke... The STROBING
LIGHTS of some strange ALIEN AIRCRAFT zooming overhead.
41.
Speeding toward Lincoln. FIRING PULSING WAVES OF ENERGY,
lighting up the distant sky.
The door opens. Nantz and Martinez edge out with Harris. As
they peer into the smoke drifting past the building, an IMAGE
becomes clear...
An ALIEN BODY. On the ground nearby. Ripped by bullets.
They step to it cautiously, realizing... IT'S NOT QUITE DEAD!
The alien MOVES, turning as if to stare back at them.
Without a word, Nantz lifts his rifle, shoots it in the head.
Kerns, Correggio and TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are on watch,
peering down to the street from opposite sides of the roof.
All on edge, exhausted, dirty. No one says a word.
Correggio eyes the other marines. They exchange an 'all-
clear' sign. Then Correggio pulls up a radio.
CPL. CORREGGIO
(INTO RADIO)
O.P. reporting. We're clear up
here.
Correggio and Kerns look over the destroyed streets, smoke
and flames rising from buildings in the distance, glimpses of
white phosphorous raining down. A beat, then...
CPL. CORREGGIO
.fucking aliens.
Kerns looks at Correggio, starts to chuckle at the absurdity
of it all. Then Correggio laughs. It's infectious. It's
desperate. Then the laughter slows. Stops.
PVT. KERNS
You think those things get scared?
They're probably just grunts like
us. Probably dumped into battle,
told to go fight...
Kerns looks out... The constant thud and crack of warfare...
A city crumbling. V
PVT. KERNS
I thought I could handle it...
CPL. CORREGGIO
You are handling it. Thing I'm
worried about is Nantz.
PVT. KERNS
Sergeant saved our ass at that
ambush... He knows what he's doing.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Yeah? Tell my brother that.
4.6 .
Correggio and Kerns are surveying the street. Correggio
pulls the RADIO up, talks quietly into it:
CPL. CORREGGIO
Stavrou, Harris...
Stavrou and Harris peer out an EXTERIOR DOOR as they hear
Correggio (V.0.) from the RADIO:
CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
.you're clear down 11th Street.
They exchange a quick glance.
CPL. STAVROU
Every day a holiday, buddy...
CPL. HARRIS
.every meal a feast.
They slip outside, running off silently.
Correggio and Kerns watch Harris and Stavrou run down the
street, covering them with their M-16s.
48.
Stavrou forces the door of a METRO BUS open, climbs INTO THE
BUS, ducking below the steering wheel as...
Harris covers, staring off to the FAR STREET. Tree branches
there cast LONG SHADOWS which sway with the breeze. Then...
The indistinct FORM of an ALIEN scout appears in the shadows.
CPL. HARRIS
Hey, Stavs...
CPL. STAVROU
Relax. First thing I wired was a
school bus. Trying to impress this
Betty. She had a huge rack...
CPL. HARRIS
Enemy scout. Move your ass.
Stavrou doesn't look up. Just works diligently.
CPL. STAVROU
Don't rush genius.
Correggio and Kerns remain still, peering into the distance.
PVT. KERNS
Shit. You seeing what I'm seeing?
Correggio pulls BINOCULARS...
POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: A SIDE STREET, TREES overhanging it.
50.
Movement. ALIEN SHAPES massing on the side street.
Appearing and disappearing through the smoke and trees.
Then the POV THROUGH BINOCULARS PANS to pick-up...
The BUS. Nearby. In the path of the alien movement.
Correggio grabs the RADIO. Says:
CPL. CORREGGIO
(INTO RADIO)
Harris. Movement, 1500 meters up
11th.
Suddenly, a loud BANG rings out below them.
PVT. KERNS
What the hell was that?!
They exchange glances with the other marines across the roof.
All four move quickly, converging on one side of the
building, look down the side of it...
An EXTERIOR DOOR leading into the center is BROKEN OPEN.
Stavrou, still beneath the wheel. Harris, eyes on the street
as the RADIO crackles with Correggio's VOICE:
CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
Harris, hostiles advancing right at
you. Approximately two hundred
meters and closing...
CPL. STAVROU
Done!
Stavrou hops into the driver's seat, tries to start the bus.
It doesn't turn over.
Harris and Stavrou exchange a quick glance. Stavrou drops
below the wheel again...
53.
The bus snakes through jammed streets, abandoned cars, bombed
out buildings.
Nantz runs down the street with the radio under his arm.
Heading toward a GAS STATION.
Nantz glances back, sees... The ALIEN AIRCRAFT SEARCHING the
street below, getting closer and closer to the bus as...
Nantz, almost to the gas station, wraps the pony tail holder
around the radio, looks back to see.
The ALIEN AIRCRAFT STOP, HOVERING OVER THE BUS!
Shining lights into it, scanning, scanning...
Nantz presses the "Push to Talk" button on the radio as...
The alien craft suddenly TURNS in NANTZ' DIRECTION.
Nantz wraps the pony tail holder around the radio, keeping
the button on it depressed so it's SENDING A CONSTANT SIGNAL.
He slides the radio toward one of the GAS PUMPS...
Keeps moving, diving BEHIND A VAN across the street.
Nantz peers around it, sees...
The alien aircraft HEADING FOR THE GAS STATION, descending.
Nantz slams a grenade into the launcher on his M-16.
The alien aircraft zooms at the gas pumps, its unearthly hum
growing louder and louder as...
NANTZ FIRES THE GRENADE.
The GAS PUMP EXPLODES! A MASSIVE FIREBALL HITS THE ALIEN
CRAFT!
Nantz flattens himself to the street as...
The ALIEN AIRCRAFT, trailing smoke and flames, thunders out
of control RIGHT OVER HIM...
Then CRASHES into a building... BLOWING APART!
Nantz runs out from behind the van, checks the remains of the
burning alien aircraft, rifle raised.
NO ALIEN inside. The ship is a DRONE.
Nantz takes this in, then starts back for the bus.
60.
The bus bangs past a few stalled cars, cruising up a ramp,
onto the freeway.
Imlay and Harris, prone, propped on their elbows, Imlay
scanning through binoculars, sees...
30-40 ALIEN FIGHTERS coming their way.
PVT. IMLAY
I got about three dozen hostiles,
twelve o'clock. 300 meters now.
Coming fast.
Nantz stands with Martinez at the concrete barrier. Nantz'
scans the marines' positions.
SGT. NANTZ
Prepare to repel. Fix bayonets!
This might get up-close and
personal!
Just a low CLATTERING now, the battle-rattle of Nantz and his
men fixing BAYONETS to their rifles. Nantz-yells out:
65.
SGT. NANTZ
Cpl. Harris!
CPL. HARRIS
Sir!
SGT. NANTZ
Being vastly outnumbered provides a
marine rifleman with what?
CPL. HARRIS
A target rich environment, sir!
SGT. NANTZ
Marines. We stand here. Let these
bastards know who they're fucking
with.
PVT. IMLAY
2/5!
Sporadic FIRE now, as the marines fire on the advancing
aliens, still at a distance.
Stavrou descends down the collapsed off-ramp, negotiating the
fractured, angled slab of roadway.
Kerns covers him above, from the freeway.
Stavrou hits the ground, securing the area. He looks up at
Kerns and gives him the "All Clear" sign. Kerns takes off...
Adukwu stands in.the bus, looking out to see Kerns running
back to them, signalling. Adukwu turns to the civilians
crowded behind him.
ADUKWU
Okay, it's clear. We're gonna go.
Amy and Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele. She hurries
the girls to the door of the bus as Kern runs up.
MICHELE
It's okay. I'll be right behind
you.
Adukwu picks up Amy. Kerns picks up Kirsten.
66.
PVT. KERNS
(takes a breath, telling
them, himself)
It's gonna be scary but we can do
it, okay?
An alien round flies through the bus, shattering the back
window! The girls scream.
Kerns and Adukwu race away, running with the girls... Rincon
grabs Hector. He and Michele follow...
RUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY...
To the off-ramp. It seems like a long way off. They run
past Correggio, rocking a SAW full auto. The FIRE is
deafening.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Come on!! Come on!! Get some!
Rincon and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look
up... They're getting closer and closer to the off-ramp as...
Alien rounds blow chunks of concrete off the roadway...
UP AHEAD, Kerns and Adukwu rush the girls to the EDGE OF THE
RAMP, hurrying to get them down as...
Rincon and Michele REACH THE OFF-RAMP now.
Kerns grabs Hector, HELPING HIM ANGLE DOWN THE OFF-RAMP,
getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting Stavrou as...
ON THE FREEWAY
BANG! MOTTOLA TAKES A ROUND TO THE SIDE.
Rincon spins, sees the marine drop, SCREAMING.
Rincon looks back at Adukwu, who is busy getting Michele down
the off-ramp now.
Then Rincon looks back to the freeway, sees Mottola writhing
in agony.
Rincon runs to Mottola, kneeling next to him.
Mottola looks up at Rincon, fear in his eyes.
RINCON
It's okay, son. I got you.
67.
Rincon starts to PULL Mottola TOWARD THE OFF-RAMP...
Struggling to get him to safety.
Mottola's body starts to convulse. Rincon stops, tries to
control him. Sees Mottola's eyes rolling back in his head.
Then Rincon is horrified when he looks up to see...
ALIENS RACING FORWARD... Heading his way!
Moving in and out of the sea of abandoned cars.
Rincon redoubles his efforts, pulling on the injured Mottola.
As he does, he looks back up to see...
The ALIENS ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF HIM now as...
BANG! The first alien is shot by...
Nantz, suddenly there, M-16 poised.
Rincon looks from Nantz to... MORE ALIENS coming at them!
No choice-- Rincon PICKS UP the injured Mottola's RIFLE.
Scared, but resolute. He looks at Nantz.
RINCON
What do I need to know?
The slightest beat, then...
SGT. NANTZ
It's set to fire in three round
bursts. We're low, so don't waste
your shots.
Rincon holds the M-16 against his shoulder, aiming.
RINCON
Just sight down the barrel...?
SGT. NANTZ
And give 'em hell.
Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in
the distance. He squeezes the trigger...
BY THE FREEWAY OFF-RAMP
Adukwu sees Rincon and the wounded Mottola now. He runs to
them, incoming rounds WHIZZ by as...
68.
Adukwu bends over Mottola, seeing that he's dead. Adukwu
closes Mottola's eyes as...
An ALIEN APPEARS from behind a car, AIMING STRAIGHT AT
ADUKWU. It is about to FIRE as...
BAM! BAM! BAM! Rincon FIRES, blowing the alien away.
Adukwu looks up, realizing Rincon just saved him.
He,meets eyes with Rincon, who stares back, stunned a moment
by his own actions. Adukwu immediately shouts a. warning.:
PVT. ADUKWU
Keep fighting!
Rincon snaps back, turns to fire... A moment too late as...
THUMP! Rincon is HIT. He falls.
Adukwu grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian's
eyes. Adukwu rips open packages of QuickClot, begins
spreading the fast-clotting powder on Rincon's wounds as...,
Harris and Imlay firing... From this height, they can see the
full expanse of freeway:
More WAVES OF ALIENS coming, using abandoned cars as cover...
CPL. HARRIS
Shit, Lieutenant, we're gonna be
overrun !
BY THE BUS / ON FREEWAY
Nantz and Martinez exchange a desperate glance on this. Then
Nantz. looks around, assessing the situation.
SGT. NANTZ
Gimme two of your smoke cannisters!
Martinez pops two canisters off, hands them to Nantz.
LT. MARTINEZ
Take someone to cover you!.
Nantz turns, sees Correggio. Then he turns the other way,
sees Kerns.
SGT. NANTZ
Kerns! Come on!
69.
PVT. KERNS
Me, Sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
I'm not worried about fightin' next
to you, Kerns. Now let's go.
A slight smile from Kerns on this as he follows Nantz...
Who sprints low, scurrying between cars... 10... 20... 30
yards closer to the enemy.
Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large SUV.
Kerns ducks low, covering Nantz. Nantz crouches, opens the
gas tank...
Unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the
canister aside... pulls the pin... flips the 'spoon' off...
SGT. NANTZ
Get ready to move on my word.
Nantz holds the fuse over the open gas cap.
SGT. NANTZ
Now!
Nantz drops the fuse into the gas tank.
They go RUNNING BACK TOWARD THE BUS as...
B0000M! The SUV EXPLODES in a ball of flames!
Nantz and Kerns dive BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE, Kerns crouching,
laying cover fire. Nantz pulls a fuse.
SGT. NANTZ
Again! Ready?!
PVT. KERNS
(pops up, fires)
Ready!
Nantz drops the fuse, they run... The CAR EXPLODES in flames!
Nantz runs to ANOTHER CAR, making sure Kerns is with him.
Harris and Imlay see what Nantz is doing...
70.
He's creating a WALL OF FLAME... Funneling the enemy into
one NARROW CORRIDOR!
Forcing them through the OPENING between the CARS ON FIRE...
PVT. IMLAY
Damn, Sergeant sure as shit's
ninja. He just gave us a kill
zone, didn't he, Corporal?
CPL. HARRIS
Soon as they come through, blow 'em
back to hell!
The first alien appears THROUGH THE BURNING CORRIDOR. Imlay
blows it away! Harris blows away the next... It's working!;.
Nantz and Kerns fall back BEHIND THE BUS, next to Martinez,
Correggio and a 2nd squad marine.
Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the
only ones left holding the aliens off. All FIRE forward as...
More and more aliens begin pouring through, braving the
flames... Into the line of fire...
Many aliens go down. But because of their sheer numbers,
few start to make it through, FIRING BACK at the marines.
Martinez sees the 2nd SQUAD MARINE go down in front of him.
Martinez rushes to his side... HE'S DEAD.
Martinez rises to shoot and...THWUMMP. Martinez is hit.
He looks down, blood running over his belt. Shock on his
face. He's been shot in the stomach.
Martinez looks around...
The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them.
Two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured
metal, firing directly into the faces of their enemy.
Martinez pulls himself together, struggling over to Nantz.
LT. MARTINEZ
Pull the men back... Pull 'em all
back now, Sergeant. I'm gonna stay
and cover.
71.
Nantz looks at Martinez about to say something. Sees the
blood draining from his stomach, down his legs.
Nantz grabs Martinez, pulling him up.
SGT. NANTZ
Lieutenant. We gotta get you outta
here. No way we're leavin' you...
LT. MARTINEZ
I said I got it...
SGT. NANTZ
I'm not leaving you here to die.
LT. MARTINEZ
That's not your call, Sergeant.
Now get your men outta here...
He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down
for him. He reaches into his vest...
Martinez hands the LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment
between them.
Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men.
SGT. NANTZ
We're pulling back. Head to the
lower street, now! NOW!
Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp, laying
cover as the men head down.
Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining
the others running to the off-ramp. Correggio sees...
MARTINEZ STAYING BEHIND, shooting at the aliens, drawing
their fire.
CPL. CORREGGIO
(TO NANTZ)
What about the lieutenant?
SGT. NANTZ
Keep movin', corporal! Go!
All the men climb DOWN THE OFF-RAMP. Nantz turns to go back
to get the Lieutenant himself, sees...
Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus.
72.
Martinez, behind the back of the bus, struggles to breath,
still drawing fire. Grabs his radio.
LT. MARTINEZ
(TRANSMITTING)
This is Lieutenant Bennie Martinez',
U.S. Marine Corps!
Aliens converge toward the back of the bus.
Ten... Fifteen... Twenty ALIENS heading for the signal...
Heading for Martinez.
LT. MARTINEZ
(TRANSMITTING)
1st Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 5th
Marines!
He turns, sees Nantz coming back for him...
Martinez pulls a smoke canister from his vest... Holds it up
for Nantz to see...
Then unscrews the fuse, pops open the gas cap of the bus...
ALIENS CLOSE IN ON MARTINEZ...
Nantz turns, dives for cover as...
Martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank...
A flash of fear across his face as... Aliens are on him as...
KABOOOOOOOOOOOOM! THE BUS EXPLODES IN FLAMES!
Massive fire ball shooting 300 feet into the sky'!
Nantz raises his head, debris raining down, sees...
ALL THE ALIENS DEAD.
His eyes wide at Martinez's sacrifice, the burden now on him,
he's in charge of the men, the civilians...
Nantz gets to his feet. Runs for the off-ramp.
73.
Nantz drops down the destroyed off-ramp... Runs to the
marines and civilians BEHIND THE ABANDONED VAN. He sees
Adukwu working on Rincon, Hector crying in Michele's arms.
SGT. NANTZ
Package Mr. Rincon for transport.
We've got to move...
CPL. CORREGGIO
Sergeant. Did you just leave Lt.
Martinez back there?
SGT. NANTZ
Lt. Martinez stayed behind. He
knew he was dying...
CPL. CORREGGIO
So you left him? Is that how it is
with you?
SGT. NANTZ
He sacrificed himself to save our
asses.
(steps to Correggio)
Now you get your head straight,
Corporal. This is my unit now.
Nantz looks at the men, who stare back, shaken.
SGT. NANTZ
Let's move. We need shelter...
Those bombs are gonna drop!
A frantic dash through the street, rubble and fires all over.
Marines carry the kids. HECTOR, in Harris' arms, head
swiveling, eyes searching for his dad, sees... Imlay and
Adukwu CARRYING rINCON, who appears lifeless.
As Nantz and the others slip out of the back...
80..
SGT. NANTZ
Stavrou, Harris.
CPL. HARRIS
Yes, Sergeant.
SGT. NANTZ
Blow something up.
CPL. STAVROU
Yes, Sergeant.
As the others RACE AWAY down the alley...
Stavrou takes his rifle butt, SMASHES the WINDOW of a nearby
CAR. Reaches in... Jams the car's gear into.neutral.
As the massive Stavrou pushes the car AGAINST THE STORE'S
BACK DOOR...
Harris pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE.
Harris.slides UNDER THE CAR... Punctures the GAS TANK.
As Harris rolls away from the FLOW OF GASOLINE...
Stavrou LIGHTS it. Both men RUN DOWN THE ALLEY.
CPL. STAVROU
Don't think they'll be comin' out
that way...
As... BOOM! The car, blocking the door, goes up in FLAMES.
DOWN THE ALLEY
Stavrou and Harris FALL BEHIND A BUILDING with the others.
NANTZ, still holding Hector, looks off to a SIDE STREET..He
signals to Kerns and Correggio.
SGT. NANTZ
Check it out.
The two marines run down the alley to the SIDE STREET.
Nantz sets Hector down. Looks the boy in the face.
SGT. NANTZ
This is the hardest thing you'll
ever have to do...
Michele, arms around Kirsten and Amy, watches Nantz.
8.1.
SGT. NANTZ
But we'll get through it together.
I promise, Hector.
Hector nods, still crying. Nantz exchanges a glance with
Michele, who moves to Hector, comforting him.
Nantz steps away as Kerns and Correggio run up, reporting:
CPL. CORREGGIO
Looks good, both directions.
Out of earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with
fiery intensity.
SGT. NANTZ
We are not losing one more of these
civilians. Period. Am I making
myself clear?
(BEAT)
Let's move.
The group jogs silently DOWN THE ALLEY.
Nantz leads the group down the residential street, tidy
bungalows on either side.
CPL. STAVROU
You okay, bro?
CPL. HARRIS
I hadn't a pushed Cherise to get
married, she'd still be in Chicago.
Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised. The squad halts as...
A SOUND fades in, a deep RUMBLING.
The marines FALL BEHIND CARS now, pulling the civilians down
with them as the RUMBLING continues to BUILD.
SGT. NANTZ
Under the cars! Now!
The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE
CARS with the civilians, pulling the kids under as...
A GIANT HOST OF ALIENS
82.
Rounds the corner in the distance, THOUSANDS'OF THEM, filling
the street from sidewalk to sidewalk. An army on the move.
NANTZ DRAGS HECTOR UNDER ONE CAR with him,' pulls the boy in
close, gets his legs under the car, under cover, just as...
The mass of aliens SWARM PAST, the ground shaking, RUMBLING.
The humans HUDDLE UNDER THE CARS, peering out to see the legs
and arms of the aliens flying by. Some bound OVER THE CARS,
which bounce up and down, BANGING with the aliens' weight.
The RUMBLING EBBS as the aliens disappear into the distance.
The squad moves in formation, surrounding the civilians.
Little Kirsten comes up behind Correggio. He's surprised as
she slips her hand into his. Correggio looks down, seeing
how scared she is. He smiles, grips her hand tightly.
Up ahead, Nantz leads, MAP in hand.
PVT. IMLAY
How far, sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
One block over.
Imlay smiles at Kerns.
PVT. IMLAY
We'.re gonna make it! Dude, we're
gonna make it...
But as they approach a CORNER... Nantz stops, exchanges a
glance with his corporals.
MICHELE
What's the matter?
SGT. NANTZ
The smell.
An ominous beat. The squad moves down the dark street as...
ASH FLOATS DOWN here from the sky... Like a beautiful early
winter snow...
THEN THEY TURN THE CORNER
83.
We slowly MOVE IN TIGHTER and TIGHTER on Nantz.
Until we are CLOSE ON NANTZ' FACE.
A REDDISH GLOW is reflected there. Nantz stops, looking
horrified. We REVERSE to see...
A DEEP BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the night sky from
NUMEROUS FIRES that rage within the fence line of...
SANTA MONICA AIRPORT.
As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation
is slowly revealed:
CRASHED F-18 JETS and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways.
BODIES and SMOLDERING MARINE VEHICLES litter the airfield.
PVT. IMLAY
Jesus... They wiped our Forward
Operating Base right off the map.
PVT. KERNS
Now we know why those bombs never
dropped. They took our jets out.
CPL. CORREGGIO
This was a dug-in marine Corps
position that had armor, air and
ground. Maybe we got nothing left
to fight with...
Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us everything--
THEY'RE LOSING THIS WAR.
Nantz turns, spies an AIRPORT FIRE STATION by the runways.
SGT. NANTZ
Let's get under cover. Now.
Black plumes of SMOKE fill the night sky as Nantz and his men
head silently toward the bodies of dead marines and aliens.
The tarmac is a smoldering WASTELAND: Empty, bombed-out
buildings on its outskirts, burning aircraft and vehicles
litter the runways. Fires crackle.
As they go, the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of
their fallen comrades, pulling out any available ammo.
IMLAY whispers a low, heartfelt refrain to the dead marines
he searches.
PVT. IMLAY
Sorry, bro.
He moves on to another fallen marine, searching.
PVT. IMLAY
Sorry, bro.
Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead
marine. Then looking up, he sees...
A LAV-25 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. INTACT.
Nantz moves to it. Then turns. A LOW WHISTLE from him and
the marines look up. They hustle to Nantz. Everyone gives
the LAV an excited once-over.
CPL. STAVROU
Looks like it just rolled off the
goddamn assembly line!
PVT. IMLAY
Good job, Sergeant!
86.
SGT. NANTZ
(TO STAVROU)
Can you drive this thing?
CPL. STAVROU
Hell, if it's got an engine,
sergeant, I can drive it.
SGT. NANTZ
Good. Get it running.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Seems like vehicles are targets...
SGT. NANTZ
A minivan's a target, Correggio. A
LAV with a Bushmaster chaingun...
That's an asset.
Imlay grins. Nantz motions to him, starting off.
SGT. NANTZ
Come on.
PVT. IMLAY
(FOLLOWING)
Me? Where, sergeant?
Nantz points to the CONTROL TOWER, its windows blown out.
SGT. NANTZ
High ground. We need to see the
big picture.
Nantz runs from the tower and climbs into the LAV.
90.
The LAV moves fast in total darkness down a car-strewn
street. Santa Monica Airport fading behind them, suddenly...
BOOOOOOM-! Bright burst of light!
And the Control Tower explodes in a ball of fire.
Miles away, the LAV drives through a CITY STREET, surrounded
by TALL BUILDINGS, the area a desolate wasteland now.
As the chopper hovers, Nantz drops to the roof, hunkers down
with the other marines. Nantz watches the evac helicopter
fly off to safety.
Then he turns to the marines, who stare back hopelessly,
clearly at their lowest point.
PVT. KERNS
Why'd we get off the chopper,
Sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
'Cause we have a job to do.
PVT. IMLAY
But we were getting out...!
CPL. CORREGGIO
You have some hunch and now we're
stuck out here in the shit?!
SGT. NANTZ
That's right. This fight's not
over.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Sergeant's gonna get us killed!
Just like my brother.
A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now.
SGT. NANTZ
Believe me, Correggio, I grieved
for every marine I ever lost...
Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine.
SGT. NANTZ
But we are in the fight of our
lives right now. And our duty is
to keep moving forward. Keep
fighting. That's how we honor men
like your brother, Correggio. And
Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father,
who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't
trained for that. He just picked
up a rifle and did what needed to
be done. If a civilian can do
that...
(MORE)
97.
SGT. NANTZ (cont'd)
Well then I better square my shit
away and do whatever I have to do
to defeat this enemy. But I can't
do it alone.
Nantz stares. The tension is palpable.
SGT. NANTZ
I need you men. And maybe we'll
die fighting today. Not because
we're heroes. But because we're
goddamn United States marines, and
always will be.
(BEAT)
I'm willing to give my full measure
for you. I'm hoping you'll do the
same for me.
A BEAT, glances exchanged. THEN ALL THE MARINES RISE AS ONE.
CPL. STAVROU
Sergeant. We'll follow you to hell
and back.
Nantz smiles, nods.
SGT. NANTZ
Good. 'Cause that's where we're
going.
The squad is moving in unison, covering all around,
approaching the LAV. They jump in.
The LAV cruises slowly. Nantz stares forward.
The BLACK DEAD ZONE looms ahead... As they get closer, it
seems like the whole area is absent of light. A black hole.
Nantz stares out, about to answer when the LAV LURCHES, then
lurches again. Stavrou REVS the engine.
SGT. NANTZ
What's going on?
CPL. STAVROU
Losing power, Sergeant. Gauges are
dropping... losing voltage...
The LAV slows. The engine skips. Then the LAV DIES.
99.
SGT. NANTZ
Stavrou?
CPL. STAVROU
She's dead, Sergeant.
Nantz looks around, warily. The streets are quiet, deserted.
SGT. NANTZ
All right, dismount. Grab anything
you think we can use.
The men nod, and move OUT OF THE LAV to...
Correggio and Kerns on one side of the street, Stavrou and
Harris on the other. Imlay with Adukwu. Nantz watches his
men move forward, covering each other's advance. Scanning'
the buildings, searching for targets...
Then Nantz halts them. They crouch together, peering at...
The middle of the DEAD ZONE just ahead of them. It is very
dark. No lights are visible from any source. The men SWEAT.
PVT. IMLAY
Hot as hell here.
CPL. CORREGGIO
No lights.
PVT. ADUKWU
My watch stopped.
SGT. NANTZ
Something's generating heat.
Messing with our electronics.
Sucking up all the power...
Nantz scans the street. The sweat dripping into his eyes.
SGT. NANTZ
Where would you put a critical
asset if you wanted to protect it?
Or hide it?
CPL. HARRIS
Underground.
Nantz points to A SUBWAY ENTRANCE AHEAD.
100.
A chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance,
and Nantz emerges, rolling down the pile to the street.
The other marines follow, set up a perimeter as..,.
Nantz takes cover behind a berm of rubble, DROPPING down,
flattening himself to the ground.
He sets the GLTD (LASER DESIGNATOR) up on top of the pile.
Nantz removes his flack jacket and places it over the laser
designator.
SGT. NANTZ
(TO HIMSELF)
Here we go...
105.
Nantz switches on the TARGETING LASER.
A RED BEAM OF LIGHT shoots from the designator to a fixed
point in the center of the street.
Nantz looks up to see...
The street fill with ALIEN SOLDIERS rushing out now.
PVT. IMLAY
Here they come!
The marines FORM A PERIMETER AROUND THE LASER, OPENING UP on
the aliens as...
The mass of aliens surges forward like a wave.
SGT. NANTZ
Hold them back! We have to keep
the laser on target!
Nantz FIRES. An alien goes down. He picks another target
and FIRES. The alien staggers, keeps coming. Three more
rounds and the alien goes down.
But the rest KEEP COMING... closing in...
FOLLOWING THE BEAM OF THE LASER BACK TO NANTZ.
Nantz is picking his targets. AIMING, FIRING... Turning,
finding targets, reloading, the aliens getting closer...
Then his rifle runs dry.
NANTZ pulls his sidearm. He aim, FIRES, shooting a closing
alien in its 'heart.' It drops.
Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another alien...
Then the next. The next. Then his sidearm is out of bullets
as... An EXPLOSION rips near Nantz.
Knocking the laser away.
Nantz struggles...TO THE LASER. RE-AIMING it as...
MORE ALIENS POUR INTO THE STREET.
The marines are pushed into a SMALL CIRCLE around the laser.
Fighting nearly back to back.
106.
Kerns is HIT. He is thrown to the ground, but is back up,
arm bleeding, firing.
An alien RUSHES AT CORREGGIO who spins just in time, FIRING
repeatedly until the alien goes down.
Stavrou swings his rifle butt, SMASHING another alien. It
staggers back. Stavrou puts numerous rounds into it.
An alien reaches ADUKWU, knocking him to the ground, about to
blast him...
Harris runs the alien through with his bayonet, twisting and
firing his rifle at the same time. The alien falls.
The marines are FIGHTING AS ONE.
All focused on SURROUNDING NANTZ. THEN THE LASER DIES.
Imlay notices the laser beam is gone.
PVT. IMLAY
Did we get a lock!?
SGT. NANTZ
I don't know!
Then... An ear-splitting NOISE. The marines look up, see...
A CRUISE MISSILE COMING STRAIGHT DOWN THE STREET!
Nantz looks up at his men, yelling:
SGT. NANTZ
INCOMING! Fall back! This way!
Nantz and his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do,
trying to hold off the aliens.
Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is
there to help him up.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Think you just twisted your ankle,.
sir.
And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this.
SGT. NANTZ
Don't stop!! We're too close to
the impact point!!
The marines start running as...
107.
MORE CRUISE MISSILES APPEAR, RIPPING TOWARD THE GROUND...
BOOOOOM! The first missile strikes!
Then another...and another ...BOOOOM! BOOOOM!
A piercing WHISTLE sounds. Nantz looks into the sky as...
Suddenly KABOOOM!!! A 2000 pound laser-guided ARTILLERY
SHELL explodes INTO THE GROUND...
THE GROUND HEAVES UP. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION of fire and smoke
erupting from beneath the surface.
