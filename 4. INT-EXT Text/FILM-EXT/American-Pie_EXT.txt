We see a Honda Accord drive by a sign at the city limits:
"Welcome to East Great Falls, Michigan -- A Great Place
To Be"
The front of the school.
KEVIN drives up in his Accord.
He's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school
senior.
VICKY rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident.
She's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big
"Vanderbilt" return address on it.
KEVIN
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
You got in.
VICKY
You think so?
She tears it open.
Pulls out a course catalog, various
forms, and a letter which she hands to Kevin.
KEVIN
"Dear Ms. Hughes.
We're sorry, but
after keeping you on the wait list for
the past couple months, we've decided
you are now rejected.
Enclosed is a
100-page, full-color brochure on how
rejected you are."
VICKY
Kevin, this is serious!
KEVIN
You got in.
Vicky SCREAMS in excitement, like a girl at a Beatles
concert.
Then she LAUGHS, and gives Kevin a big kiss and
hug.
VICKY
I love you!
She hugs Kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled,
almost perfunctorily returning the hug.
Jim has met up with CHRIS OSTREICHER -- "OZ" -- a cocky
senior with a football-player build.
He cradles a ball
in a lacrosse stick.
OZ
Illegal channels?
Shit, if there's
any channel that should be illegal,
it's whatever that women's channel is.
Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some
shit.
JIM
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little
Mermaid on TV the other night?
That
Ariel, whew.
OZ
She's a mermaid, dude.
JIM
(trumping him)
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
OZ
She's a cartoon, dude.
JIM
A hot cartoon.
OZ
Is there anything you don't jerk off
to?
JIM
C-Span?
They exit the restaurant.
JIM
What about you?
You're the one with
the girlfriend and you're still
stranded on third base.
KEVIN
You know, I've never got that shit.
What exactly constitutes third base?
OZ
(holds up a couple fingers)
Contact, dude.
KEVIN
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
They ponder this for a moment.
OZ
Shortstop.
'Course, you don't make it
to third, and you're out.
JIM
So let's say you get there...what's
uh, third base feel like?
KEVIN
Oh, man, that's kind of sad.
Jim shrugs, embarrassed.
OZ
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
JIM
Apple pie...
(then)
McDonald's or homemade?
They just look at him.
Finch hops on his scooter.
FINCH
Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia.
He MEEPS his horn and buzzes away.
A group of band dorks is on the porch, including
Michelle.
Stifler stands in the doorway, staring at them
in disbelief.
MICHELLE
We're here for the party?
STIFLER
What party?
There's no party.
MUSIC blares from inside.
A drunken HAND reaches through
the door and ruffles Stifler's hair.
PARTY GUY (O.S.)
Stiff-lerrr!
Par-tyyy!!
The hand disappears back into the house.
A beat.
STIFLER
Try the house down the street.
Stifler slams the door.
The dorks wait a moment.
BAND DORK
Ring the bell again.
MICHELLE
Ringing the bell is dorky -- let's
just go in.
We hear a CLICK OF A DEADBOLT.
Insert -- A hand pumping up the keg.
A fresh beer foams
out into the cup.
GUY #1
There we go.
Jessica and Vicky are refilling their beers at the keg.
Nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup.
VICKY
He likes it.
JESSICA
Of course he does.
What about you?
Have you just never had one with Kevin
-- or have you never had one, period?
VICKY
I think I've had one.
JESSICA
Well that's a no.
No wonder you're
not psyched about sex.
(starts filling Vicky's beer)
You've never even had one manually?
VICKY
...I've never tried it.
JESSICA
Are you kidding?
You've never double-
clicked your mouse?
Vicky shrugs.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Hell, just a pair of tight pants will
set me off.
(noticing Nadia next to them,
she passes the tap along)
Am I right or what, Nadia?
NADIA
(no bones about it)
You are right.
The hands are not
always necessary.
JESSICA
(to Vicky)
See?
NADIA
In fact -- I should teach you my own
special method.
I developed it myself
at the ballet institute in Prague.
You use nothing but the muscles of the
inner thigh.
Nadia walks off.
JESSICA
No wonder she never pays attention in
class.
Vicky nods, traumatized.
Finch is sitting on a bench, reading the paper, carefree.
Kevin and Jim approach.
KEVIN
This is your plan, Finch?
FINCH
Yep.
He turns a page.
Skims the articles.
A beat.
KEVIN
This.
Right now.
FINCH
Uh-huh.
JIM
You're just gonna sit there and drink
your coffee?
FINCH
Mochaccino.
(then)
Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I
do need to ask for your cooperation in
one small matter.
KEVIN
Of course, Finch.
What?
FINCH
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
KEVIN
What are we gonna hear?
FINCH
You'll see.
Gotta go.
Sixteen
minute round trip.
JIM
Finch, don't you think it's about time
you learned to take a dump at school?
FINCH
When was the last time you looked at
the facilities here?
KEVIN
Fifteen minutes ago.
Finch shudders and walks away.
Kevin and Jim stand
there, dumbfounded.
An ENTHRALLED GIRL approaches.
ENTHRALLED GIRL
Uh, guys?
Was that Paul Finch?
KEVIN
Yeah.
ENTHRALLED GIRL
You guys have like, seen him in the
locker room, right?
KEVIN
Yeah.
ENTHRALLED GIRL
Is it true that he's really...huge?
JIM
I have no idea.
Finch showers in a
bathing suit.
KEVIN
(forced)
No -- it's true.
He is...really...
big.
JIM
(loving it)
Yeah, enormous.
ENTHRALLED GIRL
Woah.
Does he have a date for prom
yet.
JIM
Definitely not.
ENTHRALLED GIRL
No way!
She hurries off to a GROUP OF GIRLS, sharing the gossip.
They all seem very interested.
KEVIN
(dumbfounded)
Finch hasn't done a damn thing, and
he's got girls lining up already.
Jim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase.
Kevin is walking home with Vicky.
He's a couple paces
behind her, almost tagging along.
KEVIN
I was being selfish.
And majorly
insensitive.
And I'm a total idiot.
VICKY
I think "shithead" really says it.
KEVIN
Yes!
I'm a shithead!
I'm a complete
and total shithead!
She cracks a little smile.
KEVIN (CONT'D)
And I want to try to make it up to
you.
VICKY
How?
Vicky stops walking.
Looks at Kevin.
Vicky's perfect suburban home...as we hear VICKY MOANING
IN ECSTASY.
VICKY (V.O.)
Oh...ungghhhhh!
KEVIN (V.O.)
Shhhh.
Your parents are downstairs.
The football field also doubles as the lacrosse field.
East Great Falls is battling Central.
It's a rough game,
muddy, brutal.
We see Oz grunting and groaning, playing
very tough.
On the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up.
She's
watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's
agility and domination.
Oz runs up the field, cradling
the ball in his stick.
A couple CENTRAL PLAYERS try to
check him.
Heather cringes with each impact, and is then
excited to see Oz dodge his opponents.
Finally, Oz scores with a triumphant YELL.
Heather
CHEERS with the crowd as the EGF players congratulate
each other.
After the game.
Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the
sidelines.
He's about to run over when COACH MARSHALL
snags him --
COACH MARSHALL
Good work, Ostreicher.
OZ
Thanks coach.
COACH MARSHALL
You're a killer, Ozzy!
OZ
(trying to get away)
-- Thanks, coach --
FOLLOW WITH OZ as he trots over to Heather, covered in
mud.
OZ
Hey, what're you doing here?
HEATHER
Just enjoying my exhilarating first
lacrosse experience.
You like,
"kicked butt."
A clod of mud falls from Oz's uniform onto Heather's
skirt.
OZ
(brushing it off her skirt)
Whoops, excuse me...
Oz wipes the mud from his hands.
A beat.
Heather has
something to say that's not quite coming out.
HEATHER
Um...Chris --
OZ
You can call me Oz.
HEATHER
Do I have to?
OZ
You can call me Ostreicher.
HEATHER
What's your middle name?
OZ
Forget it.
HEATHER
Come on!
I won't tell.
OZ
Neither will I.
HEATHER
Okay.
(pause)
So I had this...thought, and...this
may seem like it's out of left field,
and I don't know if you can, but since
I'm not going with anyone --
Before she can finish, Stifler runs up, sweaty and
excited.
STIFLER
Hah!
Central sucks!
(noticing Heather)
Choir Chick?
What the hell are you
doing here?
HEATHER
Well, I uh, I was --
(decides to stand her ground)
I was asking Chris to prom.
(turns to Oz)
So do you wanna go?
Oz is surprised at her directness.
Impressed.
OZ
Yeah!
STIFLER
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for
the limo.
OZ
Stifler, fuck --
(noticing Heather, "sensitive")
...man, you don't have to be so
insensitive.
A beat.
STIFLER
What??
(he dismisses it)
Whatever -- look uh, don't forget --
my cottage after prom.
On Lake
Michigan.
Stifler joins some other LACROSSE BUDDIES.
OZ
Alright, cool.
I gotta hit the
showers, but...I think this'll be
really good.
HEATHER
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
They share a smile.
Then Heather walks off towards her
car.
Oz trots off to Stifler and the other lacrosse
guys.
STIFLER
My man Oz, working it with the choir
babes?
LACROSSE BUDDIES
(cheering, slapping him)
Yeah, go Oz! etc.
Oz laughs, embarrassed.
OZ
(pandering to them)
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.
STIFLER
I'll bet you do, you little horndog,
she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies,
right?
Stifler goes into what can only be described as the Spank-
Me-And-Fuck-Me-Like-A-Whore-Dance.
STIFLER (CONT'D)
Yeah!
Sing for me!
yes!
The other guys LAUGH.
Oz joins in, laughing in spite of
himself.
They all high-five.
And from the other side of the field, we see Heather
peering over at them.
Hardly believing it as Oz joins in
the laughter.
After school.
Oz is there as Heather pulls up in a new
Saab.
OZ
Nice car.
HEATHER
I'm glad you think so.
OZ
You don't like it?
HEATHER
No, I like the car.
(then, direct)
By the way, though, about prom?
That
was like a bad idea.
Sorry I invited
you.
She hastily walks towards the school.
OZ
What?!
HEATHER
Oh, please.
I asked you because I
thought you might actually be worth
going with.
But you are just a jock.
No wait.
You're a jerk.
OZ
What?
No I'm not.
HEATHER
I saw you making fun of me with your
lacrosse buddies.
OZ
I wasn't making fun of you.
HEATHER
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
She hurries up more, breaking off from Oz, and enters the
school.
After a moment, he slowly heads in.
Jim runs like hell.
Jim trucks across the lawn to the door.
Jim sprints across the lawn.
Jim leaps over a row of bushes.
Wipes out.
Gets up and
keeps running.
Jim is walking through the courtyard, a bit dazed.
A
COUPLE GIRLS pass by him, giggling.
He trudges
along...noticing a CLIQUE OF GIRLS staring at him as he
passes by...and Stoner #1 giving him a peace sign...and
the Computer Nerd staring at him like a celebrity......
Jim's pace slows.
He hears a SNICKER behind him...he
slows even more, taking very careful steps...as he sees a
GIRL doing a really strange dance -- and his eyes pop out
as he sees that, yes, it's his dance.
He stops.
ALMOST
EVERYONE is staring at him.
Jim pulls his coat up over
his face and hurries off into the school, like a fugitive
avoiding the media.
People APPLAUD and LAUGH.
The remains of a couple subs are on a table.
Oz and
Heather are doing their song...it's rough, but they're
working through it.
And when they're in sync, they sound
really good together.
We SLOWLY PULL BACK as they sing
into the night.
Kevin is talking to GRETA.
She points offscreen.
Heather is studying outside.
Oz stands before her,
breathless, his hair still wet.
OZ
...I've got this lacrosse game.
It's
really important, it's our last game.
And you know, Central almost beat us
last time, so I really want to kick
their ass, and it's like cool because
we're gonna get to play at State,
which means that after the game I
might be able to stop by...
HEATHER
(pause)
You can't sing at the competition.
OZ
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.
I
just...I didn't realize it...
HEATHER
(upset but trying to be cool)
...it's okay, you should do whatever
makes you happy.
OZ
Alright...yeah...thanks for
understanding.
(a beat)
So I guess...I'll see you later.
An uncomfortable moment.
Oz walks off.
Heather looks
let down.
Kevin is at his locker, getting ready for class.
Stifler
comes running up with a wicked grin on his face.
STIFLER
Kevin!
You seen Shitbreak lately?
KEVIN
(immediately sensing danger)
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
STIFLER
Me?
Nothing.
I'm the one whose ass
he kicked.
(off Kevin's look)
I'll tell you one thing, though.
I
don't think he's gonna have a problem
shitting in school anymore.
Stifler pulls out an empty bottle of PRESCRIPTION
LAXATIVE, maniacally LAUGHING.
Oz is playing in the final lacrosse game.
The team
scores -- they're beating Central.
Everyone cheers,
except Oz.
We see Jim and Kevin in the stands, CHEERING.
Establishing.
The campus of Michigan State University.
Students pass in front of an older, impressive university
building.
A sign out front reads, "MICHIGAN STATEWIDE VOCAL
COMPETITION."
A scoreboard shows that East is leading by five goals.
Oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling
the ball in his stick.
He seems to have a good lead.
Suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball.
Someone has checked him.
He lays stunned on the ground,
as Stifler recovers the ball and scores.
The players run back to the sidelines to reset for the
face-off, and gather around the coach.
COACH MARSHALL
Alright!
Good hustle, guys, but we
can still lose.
You all saw what
happened to Oz out there.
I don't
ever want to see you guys thinking
you're gonna score.
You don't score
until you score, period.
The team is getting into it.
Shouts of "Hell yeah!"
But
Oz's got a quizzical look on his face.
Oz shows some emotion peeking through.
Confused.
COACH MARSHALL
It all boils down to today.
For you
seniors, this marks the culmination of
your past four years.
Think of what
that means to you.
Are you guys gonna
look back on your days at East and
know that you made the most of the
time you had?
A wave of realization washes over Oz.
He stands up tall.
COACH MARSHALL (cont'd)
Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher!
Oz collects himself.
Takes a deep breath.
OZ
Good luck, guys.
he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave.
COACH MARSHALL
Christ!
I didn't say you were out of
the game!
OZ
Sorry, coach.
COACH MARSHALL
What the fuck is this?
You got
someplace more important to be?
Coach Marshall is fuming.
The entire team is staring at
Oz.
OZ
Yeah.
He runs off.
ANGLE ON JIM AND KEVIN IN THE STANDS
A beat of confusion.
Then they stand up.
Oz runs through a gate.
Finch still sits.
His head is cocked at a different
angle.
The parking lot is full.
VARIOUS FORMALLY DRESSED
STUDENTS make their way into the school.
One group piles
out of a stretch limo.
We see a STEALTHY STUDENT slip a
bottle of liquor into his tux.
A FLUSTERED GUY struggles
to re-attach his date's corsage.
This is the prom.
Kevin sits on the steps into the school, depressed.
Kevin still sits there.
Jim, Oz, and Finch come out of
the school.
Slowly they walk up to Kevin.
OZ
...Guess what?
KEVIN
I don't care.
JIM
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's
is gonna be here soon.
KEVIN
I'm not going.
A beat as the guys don't know what to say.
Kevin's
speech is halting, downbeat.
KEVIN (CONT'D)
This isn't how I wanted things to turn
out.
Making the pact wasn't just
about getting laid.
It was about
doing one last thing with you guys
before we graduated.
But now I've
just wasted my last few weeks here
trying to do what?
I don't even know.
All I managed to do was fuck up our
friendship.
A beat.
Oz shrugs.
OZ
I still think you're okay.
JIM
So do I, Kev.
FINCH
Me too.
For the most part.
KEVIN
Nah.
Fuck, you guys are right, I
don't know what I'm doing.
I mean I'm
acting like I've got it all together
tonight.
But I know Vicky is gonna
ask me if I love her.
And I don't
know what I'm gonna say.
So now it's
like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the
whole thing.
JIM
Come on man.
Tonight is the night.
We're finally going to a post-prom
party on the lake.
We've been waiting
to do this for the last four years.
Why else are we still friends with
Stifler?
You gotta go.
A beat as Kevin ponders this.
OZ
And by the way, Sherman didn't even
get laid.
KEVIN
He didn't?
FINCH
Nope.
He pissed himself.
The guys LAUGH as Kevin is puzzled.
THEY are suddenly
illuminated by the glare of headlights.
A charter bus
pulls in front of the school.
JIM
There it is.
I want to grab my bag.
Oh, and my date.
OZ
Come on, Kevin.
Vicky's looking for
you.
Jim holds out a helping hand.
Kevin looks at it.
Grabs
it, and Jim pulls him up.
A beautiful cottage on the shore of Lake Michigan.
Students are filing out of the charter bus.
Jim and Michelle are walking up to the cottage.
JIM
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
MICHELLE
It reminds me of this one time --
(changing thoughts)
Hey, can I ask you a question?
How
come you don't have any stories?
I've
got lots of stories, and you don't
have any.
JIM
Oh, I've got stories, believe me.
They're a little more risque than
tales of Band Camp.
MICHELLE
Are they gross or something, like guy
stuff?
Tell me.
JIM
Okay.
You want a story?
Here's a
story.
Stifler finds this beer,
right?
And...
Oz and Heather are walking down the beach.
Holding
hands.
Deep in the background, we see kids partying.
OZ
There's something I've been meaning to
tell you, Heather.
HEATHER
What's that?
OZ
It's gonna sound really bad, but I
want you to know.
She nods.
They stop walking.
Oz swipes his feet around
in the sand.
OZ (cont'd)
See, uh, I'm a virgin.
And me, Kevin,
Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact.
That we would...lose our virginity...
before high school was over.
Heather is listening.
OZ (cont'd)
And, see, tonight is supposed to be
the night we all do it.
HEATHER
This isn't the best way to proposition
me.
OZ
No, that's not what I mean.
I mean --
look.
You know what made me leave
that game?
Coach was giving this
speech, about not slacking off when
you see the opportunity to score.
HEATHER
This isn't any better, Chris.
OZ
No, see Heather, what I realized is
that...with you, it's not like I'm
running towards the goal, trying to
figure out the best way to score.
And
this may sound corny, but --
He takes her hand.
OZ (cont'd)
I feel like I've already won.
Heather softens, taken off guard.
OZ (cont'd)
And, well, I really care about you.
A
lot.
And I want you to know that.
HEATHER
Oz, it's okay, I know.
OZ
You called me Oz.
HEATHER
Well, that's what your friends call
you.
I mean...I feel like I'm one of
your friends now...and also...your
girlfriend.
Oz seems truly touched.
OZ
Dieter.
My middle name is Dieter.
Heather nods, and speaks pensively.
HEATHER
Hmm.
You know that's
(cracking up)
really a shitty middle name!
OZ
(laughing)
I know, it sucks!
Through their laughter, they kiss.
After a moment, it
grows more passionate.
Lost in each other.
Oz and Heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes,
surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring
breeze.
Stars and a lustrous moon above.
The silence speaks.
We can see it in their eyes.
Yearning.
OZ
I can't think of anything to say
that's not cheesy.
HEATHER
Then don't.
They kiss.
It's time.
Heather and Oz are re-inventing the idea of passion.
Discovering love.
This is the stuff that you thought
only existed in romance novels.
Seriously.
Oz and Heather.
Souls entwined.
Making love.
Oz could be coming.
Heather could be coming.
But it's
all so darn passionate that the whole thing looks like
one big orgasm anyway.
The sun rises over Lake Michigan.
A brand new day.
Various students are passed out here and there.
Oz holds Heather in his arms.
Completely peaceful.
SEAGULLS CALL to each other.
WAVES BREAK on the shore.
Oz has lost all pretense.
Smiling to himself, or maybe
to the world.
A sign on the window reads, "Congratulations Seniors!"
