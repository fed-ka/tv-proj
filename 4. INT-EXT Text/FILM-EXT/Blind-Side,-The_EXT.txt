We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday
Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the
two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the
ball. As the play begins --
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the
Redskins quarterback, takes the
snap and hands off to his running
back.
JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps
forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann.
The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Two Mississippi. It's a trick play,
a flea flicker, and the running
back tosses the ball back to the
quarterback.
HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has
the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and
to the side and Carson flies past.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Three Mississippi. Up to now the
play's been defined by what the
quarterback sees. It's about to be
defined by what he doesn't.
LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins
lineman trying to block him.
(CONTINUED)
2 CONTINUED: 2
The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses.
Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann.
The image FREEZES.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor
is the best defensive player in the
NFL and has been from the time he
stepped onto the field as a rookie.
The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes
Theismann's body.
PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating.
TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
He will also change the game of
football as we know it.
WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES.
FRANK GIFFORD (V.0.)
Again, we'll look at it with the
reverse angle one more time. And I
suggest if your stomach is weak you
just don't watch.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
Joe Theissman never played another
down of football.
3 TEAM PHOTO OF THE 2005 SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 3
LEIGH ANNE'S. VOICE
Now, y'all would guess that more
often than not the highest paid
player on an NFL team is the
quarterback.
The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
And you'd be right. What you
probably don't know is that more
often than not the second highest
paid player is, thanks to Lawrence
Taylor, a left tackle.
The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle.

3 CONTINUED: 3
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Because, as every housewife knows,
the first check you write is for
the mortgage and the second is for
the insurance. The left tackle's
job is to protect the quarterback
from what he can't see coming. To
protect his blind side.
4 SERIES OF SHOTS 4
"Famous" left tackles - Jonathan Ogden, Orlando Pace, Andre
Gurode. Then we SEE SHOTS of their hands, feet, waists,
etc., corresponding with ---
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
The ideal left tackle is big, but a
lot of people are big. He is wide
in the butt and massive in the
thighs. He has long arms, giant
hands and feet as quick as a
hiccup.
A street anchored by project housing and littered with broken
down cars and ne'er-do-wells. Lots of folks out, milling
about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving
TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed.
He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully
steps instead of strutting. His name is MICHAEL OHER.
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
This is a rare and expensive
combination the need for which can
be traced to that Monday night game
and Lawrence. Taylor. For on that
day he not only altered Joe
Theismann's life, but mine as well.
As Michael continues toward us he begins to go OUT OF FOCUS --
INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.O.)
Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?
(NO RESPONSE)
Mr. Oher?...
MICHAEL (V.0.)

INVESTIGATOR'S.VOICE (V.O.)
Do you know, do you understand why
I'm here?
MICHAEL (V.0.)
To... investigate.
INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.0.)
Yes. To investigate. I'm here to
investigate your odd...
predicament.
The Taurus exits into --
The Taurus passes an endless supply of churches and strip
joints, all of which Michael's eyes take in.
We've gone from slums to nice neighborhoods - fathers and
sons play baseball, kids tend lemonade stands, sprinklers
keep the grass emerald green.
Michael's face tells us he's never seen anything like this.
The Taurus enters the parking lot filled with nice cars.

Steven and Michael eye the freshly painted buildings, the
flowers, the new playground jungle gyms and outdoor hoops.

STEVEN
Sure is pretty, huh, Big Mike?
Mike doesn't answer, just takes it all in. Steven sees and
opens a container filled to the brim with balls - footballs,
basketballs, four square balls.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
Not even locked!
MICHAEL
White people are crazy.
For a boy his size Michael can really move. He dribbles,
fakes left, then falls away, making a long three pointer.
Cotton's eyes get a little wider as he watches --
Michael dribbles the ball between his legs, behind his back
and jumps high, slamming the ball through the hoop. Big men
aren't supposed to move like this.
Cotton's lips are almost quivering --
COTTON
Mother of God...
First day of class. Students, mostly blonde-haired and blue-
eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry
their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with
friends they haven't seen over the summer.
Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the
arch. Beneath the school name we read "WITH MEN THIS IS.
POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE". Michael takes a
deep breath and enters. He carries his "school bag" - a
plastic grocery sack.
Just as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those
around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only
the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants
and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to
the fact that he doesn't belong here.
Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a
wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone.
School is out. Steven walks up to Michael...
STEVEN
Hey, Big Mike, um... my Pops'
girlfriend... she don't really want
you to stay with us no more.
Big Tony's Taurus pulls into the lot.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
We can still give you rides if you
want?
MICHAEL
Naw, it's aright.
Steven gets in the Taurus. Michael watches it drive away.
24
School is out and Michael walks among the kids of all shapes
and sizes. Two little Kindergarten girls'try and swing
themselves. Michael stops nearby, watching them.
MICHAEL
They're stuck, not sure if they should talk to this
"stranger". They jump off the swings and run away.
SI (OS)
Smile at 'em.
Michael turns to see Si nearby, watching him.

It lets them know you're their

little kids born blind smile?
They've never seen anyone do it
before but they smile anyway. So
it's universal. That's why it
works. Not that you should fake it
or anything... You're Big Mike,
right?
Sean holds. out a fist for Mike to "knock" and the two walk
toward the school entrance.
SJ (CONT'D)
I'm Sean, but everyone calls me Si --
that's for Sean Junior because my
father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy.
He was a basketball star at Ole
Miss, point guard, and now he owns
like a million Taco Bells.
Leigh Anne's car pulls up to the pick up/drop off and Si
starts toward it.
SJ (CONT'D)
Manana'.
Michael smiles at the kid, who smiles back.
Michael watches Leigh Anne's car disappear.

Michael turns to see Paul Sandstrom, the principal.
Michael and Sandstrom sit on a bench.
SANDSTROM
Mike, I just got a call from
someone at the police department.
(off Michael's look)
Do you remember the story in the
papers awhile back about the man
who fell off an overpass?
(Michael shakes his head)
No one knew who he was and they're
not sure if he jumped, or if... at
any rate he passed away.
Sandstrom struggles with how to say the words.
SANDSTROM (CONT'D)
Mike, the man... was your father.
Michael takes this in. without showing emotion.
SANDSTROM (CONT'D)
They've been looking for someone to
notify and came across your name on
our registry. I'm really sorry,
son.
(NO RESPONSE)
Were you close?
(Michael shakes his head)
When did you last see him?
MICHAEL
Iono.
SANDSTROM
I'll try and find out where he's
buried. Maybe we could go visit?
Michael nods, then rises and walks away.
Michael sits at a bus stop with his bag, rises as a bus stops
in front of him.

The Blind Side -- Yellow Draft - 04/15/09 22
Michael sits in the corner, his head resting against the
window, trying to sleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
A banner over the arch reads: THANKSGIVING PAGEANT TONIGHT!
Kids in costume - Pilgrims, Indians, turkeys - race out the
door to greet their proud parents. Si, in an ornate
headdress looks for and spots Sean and Leigh Anne waving.
They walk away together toward the parking lot.
41-42 OMITTED 41-42
Sean's car stops at a red light and Michael crosses in front
of them, wearing just his shorts and short sleeved shirt.
The BMW pulls to a stop alongside Michael. Leigh Anne gets
out, walks up to Michael.
LEIGH ANNE
Big Mike, my name is Leigh Anne
Tuohy. My kids go to Wingate. You
said you're going to the gym?
Michael slowly nods.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
The school gym's closed.
Michael takes this in but doesn't respond.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Why were you going to the gym?
(again no answer)
Big Mike?! Why were you going to
the gym?
MICHAEL
Because... it's warm.
This hits her all at once. She bites her lip.
LEIGH ANNE
Do you have anywhere to stay
tonight?
Michael eyes the ground, then nods.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Don't you dare lie to me.
The car enters the driveway of a beautiful home and stops.
Michael, plastic sack in hand, walks away. Leigh Anne exits
the front door, spots Michael and tries to catch up.
LEIGH ANNE

He stops, turns. Leigh Anne walks over.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Where are you going?
MICHAEL
Iono.
LEIGH ANNE
Are you spending Thanksgiving with
your family?
Michael shakes his head.
An expansive beehive of rotting housing. It's the place we
saw when we first laid eyes on Michael and nothing's changed.
Leigh Anne's car stops at one of the complexes.
LEIGH ANNE
This is where your mother lives?
He nods and she opens her door.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Okay, let's go.
He forcefully reaches across her and closes the door,
catching her off guard.
MICHAEL
Don't get out!
LEIGH ANNE
Who's going to help you with your
clothes?
MICHAEL
(POINTED)
Don't get out of the car.
Michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock
before he closes the door.
She watches as he walks toward the structure, then notices
several of the local ne'er-do-wells eyeing her. she locks
the doors again, just for luck.

Michael walks slowly past a few gang-bangers on the steps.
The obvious leader, ALTON, eyes him.
ALTON
Big Mike! Where you been?!
Michael ignores, keeps walking.
ALTON (CONT'D)
And who's that fine piece o' thing
driving you around?
One of Alton's minions, DAVID, sits nearby. Michael sees
him, nods.
MICHAEL
Hey, David.
David, a little embarrassed to be with Alton, nods back.
Michael arrives at an apartment and stops, taken aback. On
the door is an EVICTION NOTICE and padlock.
He reads from the eviction for several seconds.
An Addict down the way fires up and slumps into bliss.
With Leigh Anne's car in the bg., Michael, hidden from view
slumps against a wall, looking lost - the first real emotions
we've seen from-him.
Wrong side of the tracks. Michael and Leigh Anne cross the
street toward the shop.
LEIGH ANNE
I've lived in Memphis my whole life
and never been anywhere near here.
You're going to take care of me,
right?
MICHAEL
I got your back.
LEIGH ANNE
That's good to know. Thank you.
As they start to walk, Leigh Anne reaches up and takes
Michael's arm. He holds it out for her.
Drop off area. Leigh Anne's car pulls up and SJ, Collins and
Michael get out.
LEIGH ANNE
Have a great day. Learn something!
They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch.
Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a GARGANTUAN
ORANGE AND MAROON STRIPED RUGBY SHIRT.
Leigh Anne shakes her head, watching him walk away. A car
behind her HONKS. She checks the rear view mirror --
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Don't get your panties in a wad.
Sean's car pulls up to the valet. As the family gets out
Leigh Anne notices a bookstore next door and starts for it.
LEIGH ANNE
I've got a design book I need to
get. Sean, go check on our
reservation.
SEAN
They'll seat us when we walk in the
door. You can get the book after
dinner.

SJ shrugs and joins the girls, as does Michael. Sean watches
as his family deserts him.
The Tuohy family exits and waits for the valet.
SEAN
Now that was a good steak.
COLLINS
Thanks, Daddy.
MICHAEL
Thanks.
SEAN
You're welcome.
As the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except Michael
who notices something else --
AT THE SIDE DOOR: A BUSBOY steps outside for a smoke.
Michael absently walks over.
SEAN (CONT`D)
Michael?...
Leigh Anne touches Sean's arm, silencing him. They watch as --
Michael greets the busboy. They stand a few feet apart
talking. They nod at each other and after a few seconds --
They hug.
Leigh Ann is amazed. She's never seen affection in Michael.
Michael walks up to the two little Kindergarten girls from
before, sitting in the swings. He smiles. They smile back.
FIRST LITTLE GIRL
Hi Mike.

Hi. Need a push?
They giggle and Michael pushes them, one arm each until
they're flying high and squealing.

Collins watches.
Several players, in full gear, drag equipment out onto the
field under the watchful eye of Bert Cotton. Sean Tuohy sits
in the nearby stands.
Michael carries four blocking dummies to the center of the
field and tosses them like they're pillows. Cotton smiles.

first practice.
(LATER) 96
Michael is lined up at defensive tackle. The offense breaks
the huddle and Michael just stands there. He notices the
other defensive linemen get in a stance and kind of squats a
bit. When the ball is snapped he just holds his hands out,
keeping the blocker from getting close to his body.
The running back races right past him and into the secondary.
THE WHISTLE BLOWS and Cotton races up to Michael.
COTTON
Okay, Mike, you fought off the
block but you've got to shuck him
and make the tackle. You got it?
NEXT PLAY
Michael gets down in a his stance and when the ball is
snapped he gets under the blocker and lifts him up like WWF.
The quarterback goes back to pass and sees Michael lumbering
toward him with the lineman on his shoulders.
The Quarterback's eyes go wide and he races out of the pocket
and throws and incomplete pass. ANOTHER WHISTLE.
COTTON (CONT'D)
Shuck the blocker, Mike!
Michael gingerly sets the lineman on the ground.
IN THE STANDS
Leigh Anne shows up, sits next to Sean.

COTTON (CONT'D)
No! No! No!
As players leave the field, Bert Cotton walks and talks with
Leigh Anne and Sean...
COTTON
Most kids from bad situations can't
wait to be violent and that comes
out on the field. But this kid, he
doesn't seem to wanna hit anyone.
LEIGH ANNE
(almost to herself)
He's Ferdinand the Bull.
COTTON
What?
LEIGH ANNE
Nothing.
COTTON
I thought for sure he was gonna be
a player. I can't believe I used
up my chits to get him in school.
LEIGH ANNE
I thought you said it was your
Christian duty?
He gives her a smirk.
SEAN
Look, Bert, he's never even played
before.

Si, holding a sheet and wearing a whistle, stands before
Michael. No one else'is around.
SI
This is your summer workout sheet.
First it says to warm up and get
loose.
(off Michael's look)
Well, go ahead, get loose.
Michael moves his arms around a bit then stops.
SJ (CONT'D)
You loose?
(MICHAEL NODS)
Okay, next is five one hundred yard
runs to stretch out your legs.
Michael grimaces.
MICHAEL
Let's go home, play some video
games.
SI
Look, everybody at. Wingate is
expecting you to be a star football
player. You don't want to let them
down, do you?
MICHAEL
Iono..
SI
What about Dad and Mom?
(off Michael's look)
'Cause you see, in our family,
everyone's an athlete. Dad was a
basketball star, Collins plays
volleyball and runs track. Me, as
you know, I do it all and Mom,...
well, Mom was a cheerleader, which

Michael does ten yard "back and forths" as Si times him.
Michael does push ups as SJ lowers himself to count.
Michael does crab crawls.
WIDE - SJ runs Michael through his workout. He blows his
whistle and Michael collapses on the ground - dead tired.
Looks the same as before except for the'blonde woman walking
between the buildings.
Leigh Anne spots and checks a list of tenants posted. She
can barely see through the cover as someone has scrawled "C
Block" on it.
The one Michael visited before. Leigh Anne summons her
courage and knocks on the door. And again. No answer.
A VOICE comes from the apartment behind her --
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

wine cooler or sumthin'?
LEIGH ANNE
No, I can't, but thank you.
Leigh Anne speaks with a mother trying to keep her son from
hurting himself on a rusty slide. The mother points to
another building.
A door opens revealing DENISE OHER in a ratty robe.
LEIGH ANNE
Hi. Mrs. Oher?
DENISE OHER
You from the state?
LEIGH ANNE
No. My. name is Leigh Anne Tuohy and
your son Michael lives with me.
And my family.
Denise takes this in.
Michael, blindfolded, is led outside by the entire family.
When Leigh Anne pulls if off, Michael gasps at the sight of -
A NEW TRUCK in the driveway.
SEAN
Is that the one you wanted?
He just stands there, staring. Sean hands him the keys.
SEAN (CONT'D)
Well, hell, take it for a spin.

Go on.
SI
Can I go, too?
LEIGH ANNE

And they walk off together to class.
THE-truck CRASHES into the side of a VAN.
A massive traffic jam. Leigh Anne pulls her car right onto
the median, gets out and starts running. She passes stopped
cars and weaves past bystanders on her way to:
THE COLLISION INTERSECTION
As she approaches she sees -- Michael's truck -- the front end
is smashed -- The Van - its side caved in -- And --
Michael sitting on the curb, crying. She races over --
LEIGH ANNE

He looks up, sobbing.
MICHAEL
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!
LEIGH ANNE
Where's SJ?!
MICHAEL

Go help him! Please go help him!
Leigh Anne turns to see a group of PARAMEDICS kneeling around

LEIGH ANNE AND PARAMEDIC - MINUTES LATER
While the paramedics attend to an obviously fine SJ, Leigh
Anne and a FIREMAN eye the deflated airbag.
FIREMAN
An airbag deploys at 200 miles per
hour. Your son's too small to sit
in the front seat.
LEIGH ANNE
He's okay, though, right?
FIREMAN
Busted lip, some facial bruising.
When an airbag strikes a child his
size it usually means a fractured
face, a broken neck or worse. It's
almost like the airbag started at
him then changed direction.
Defective or something. Very, very
lucky.
Leigh Anne nods thanks and looks to Michael, still on the
curb, eyes on the ground. She walks over, kneels down.
LEIGH ANNE
Michael, it wasn't your fault. It
could have happened to anybody..
He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices --
HIS ARM - red, bleeding, a large burn from the wrist all the
way up to the sleeve, which is also singed.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Michael, your arm... what happened?
He looks up and into her eyes...
MICHAEL

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Do you remember just after we met,
and we went to that horrible part
of town to buy you those dreadful
clothes?
(HE NODS)
And I was a little scared and you
told me not to worry, that you had
my back?. Do you remember that?
MICHAEL
Yes ma'am.
LEIGH ANNE
If anyone tried to get to me you
would have stopped them, right?
(HE NODS)
And when you and Si were in that
car wreck, what did you do to that
airbag?
MICHAEL
I stopped it.
Leigh Anne points to the offense.
LEIGH ANNE
This team is your family. And you

MICHAEL
What about Mr. Tuohy and Collins?
LEIGH ANNE
I suppose they can be on the team,
too. Are you going to protect the
family, Michael?
He nods. She nods back and walks away, past Bert Cotton.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Yelling at him won't help. He

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
You're gonna wanna get this.
INTERCUT VIDEO AND LIVE ACTION:
At the snap Michael drives the defender into the dirt.
Michael drops back, knocks down one defender, then takes

Hut! Tony, the Wingate QB starts to drop back but hands off
the ball on a draw to BOBBY, the Oompaloompah.
Michael, unsure which player to block, just stands there
while they both crush Bobby.
The Milford players high five and both give Michael a
shoulder as they pass him.

Michael and keeps moving, forcing a pileup near the sideline.
Michael and Bobby are at the bottom of the pile.
66 extricates himself from the pile and gives Michael a

MILFORD #66
Big black pile of nigger crap!
Cotton is nearby, hears this, races straight over to the Ref.

Michael gets in his stance and on the snap of the ball powers

The Referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the
