We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and
PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of
water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms --
until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother.
ERIC (V.O.)
Soon after, a daughter was born to the
Queen and was named "Snow White."
With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud
father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King
cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.
ERIC V/O
And she was adored throughout the kingdom
as much for her defiant spirit as for her
beauty.
Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen
turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow
White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's
smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken.
YOUNG SNOW WHITE
We found it in the woods.
The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King
looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and
carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the
doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks.
The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing.
QUEEN
It will heal in time.
Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.

SNOW WHITE
I'll look after it.
The King watches Snow White, hiding his sorrow behind a smile.
So does the Queen, holding back her tears.
QUEEN
You possess a rare beauty, my love. In
here.
(She touches Snow white's heart)
Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need
its strength to one day become Queen.
YOUNG RAVENNA - her face reflected in a small hand mirror.
Ravenna as a child, beautiful but poor, looks into the
mirror. Her MOTHER, a gypsy woman in tattered clothes, moves
the mirror closer.
RAVENNA'S MOTHER
This - is all that can save you, Ravenna.
The young Ravenna looks away, distracted by SHOUTS and
COMMOTION outside.
CU - RAVENNA'S FACE
Present day. Still as a statue and even more beautiful as
cheeks are powdered, eyebrows plucked and lips painted by
several sets of HANDS. Her eyes stare straight ahead,
unblinking, her mind elsewhere.
Attendants are preparing Ravenna for her wedding to the King.
SNOW WHITE (O.S.)
You're so beautiful...
Ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of Snow White,
reverential, standing a few feet away.
Ravenna's face softens as she looks at the face of Snow
White. Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out
her arm - "Come."
As Snow White steps forward, the handmaidens withdraw until
only one is left, weaving beautiful flowers in Ravenna's
hair.
RAVENNA
That is kind, child. Especially when it is
said that yours is the face of true beauty
in this kingdom.
Snow White doesn't quite know how to answer this.
RAVENNA
(A warm smile)
Would you like to be dressed up like this
and married one day?
Snow White nods.
RAVENNA
I hope you'll invite me?
YOUNG SNOW WHITE
Of course.
Snow White smiles, enchanted by her new friend.
RAVENNA
I know it is difficult, child. When I
was your age I, too, lost my mother.
SNOW WHITE
You did?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
RAVENNA
Yes. A King tore me from her arms,
dressed me in lace and stole my
innocence.
Snow White's smile dies a bit; confused.
RAVENNA
I can never take your mother's place, but
I feel that you and I are bound.
(touches her heart)
I feel it here.
Snow White mimics, touching her own heart, and smiles at
Ravenna. It should be a touching moment but something in
Snow White's face - the way her smile lights up the room -
gives Ravenna pause.
Ravenna, in a stunning dress,.walks down the center aisle. All
the NOBLES in the land are present.
Ravenna looks at them, on either side of the aisle. They are all
smiling, nodding appreciation. But they aren't really looking
at Ravenna. She follows their gaze to --
Snow White, behind, holding the folds of silk from the
wedding dress. Snow White looks up, adoringly, at Ravenna.
As the bride and groom reach the altar, KING MAGNUS turns and
smiles, the happiest man alive.
King Magnus lies on the bed, drunk - half with wine and half
with lust. His eyes fixed on --
Ravenna, in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the fireplace,
holding a goblet. Staring a seductive hole through him.
She starts slowly toward him, never taking her eyes off him.
He licks his lips - can't wait for her to arrive.
KING MAGNUS
(Gazing at her lustfully)
Who are you?
RAVENNA
The bane of Kings.
When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed, rolls
him on his back, straddles him and offers the goblet.
RAVENNA
Sup, my lord.
King Magnus drains the goblet, tosses it and gropes her body.
(CONTINUED)

13 CONTINUED: 13
RAVENNA
Now you are mine.
Her eyes gleam in the firelight. Magnus tries to playfully
wrestle her off, but she grabs his hands and holds him down
firmly.
RAVENNA
I will destroy you.
KING MAGNUS
(LOVING IT)
Indeed, you will.
She rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on the
lips. He can't believe how good she tastes.
RAVENNA
As my people were destroyed. As my family
was destroyed. As I would have been
destroyed.
He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show
discomfort.
RAVENNA
But when a woman stays young forever - no
man can resist her - and the world is hers.
He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE, his eyes widening in surprise.
As he struggles for breath...
KING MAGNUS
What...?
RAVENNA
First I will take your life, my lord. Then
I will take your throne.
She reaches beneath the sheets, pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER
and BRINGS IT DOWN THROUGH HIM --
Ravenna's mother takes Ravenna's hand and holds it over a
bowl of white liquid.
RAVENNA'S MOTHER
You must trust me, my love.
With a small blade she nicks Ravenna's wrist. Three drops of
blood fall into the white liquid - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Finn, Ravenna's brother blasts through the door.
FINN
They're coming! The King's men!
RAVENNA
Drink!
Ravenna chokes it down.
RAVENNA'S MOTHER
Drink! And with it the ability to steal
youth and beauty! For that is your
ultimate power and only protection.
Finn steps forward.
FINN
I will protect my sister!
Ravenna's mother reaches out and touches her son's forehead,
closes her eyes, an incantation of sorts...
FINN
So it shall be, Finn.
CUT TO:
We see the shadows of the invaders sweeping through the
corridors, putting the King's sleeping soldiers to the sword.

Snow White lies asleep when she hears a bell ringing. At first
she thinks she's dreaming, but then she hears cries of alarm.
She sits up curiously, then climbs out of bed --
There's panic and chaos outside, COURTIERS and SOLDIERS running
for their lives. Snow White stares in confusion, then runs too -
Snow White rushes towards her father's chamber and sees Ravenna
at the end of the corridor. Relieved, she hurries towards her
stepmother when suddenly she notices her father's lifeless body
lying on the bed. FINN and his KNIGHTS appear beside Ravenna. It
takes a moment for the betrayal to sink in, tears of shock
welling in Snow White's eyes, before she turns and flees --
Ravenna walks from statue to painting to urn, toppling and
tearing them from the walls. Cleaning house. Ravenna's soldiers
deliver a large object, then leaving her alone. A BEAUTIFUL
MIRROR rests against the wall. Ravenna stares at it.
RAVENNA
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all?
There'.s a brief silence, then the surface of the mirror ripples.
LIQUID-spills onto the floor where it reforms into the shape of
THE MIRROR MAN. His body is a veil of reflective bronze but his
face-is a distorted version of Ravenna's own.
(CONTINUED)

20 CONTINUED: 20
MIRROR MAN
it is you, my Queen! Yet another kingdom
falls to your glory! Is there no end to
your power and beauty?
Ravenna smiles, moves to the center of the room, raises her arms
and drunk with power --
SCREAMS! The scream becomes --
CUT TO:
ERIC V/O
And all this time, she kept Snow White in
a cell in the north tower.
Ravenna, in the shadows, sits perfectly still. Though it's
been years she looks the same. The object of her gaze is --
Snow White, who has changed. She is now a woman, lying in a
darkened cell. Asleep.
Around the corner, Finn secretly eyes his sister, who doesn't
notice him.
Ravenna, just outside the cell, doesn't blink, entranced by
Snow White. Strange.
Snow White opens her eyes and sees Ravenna. This is not the
first time this has happened. Their eyes locked. Then...
SNOW WHITE
Why?...
Ravenna doesn't answer, just stands and walks away.
12A
We get our first good look at grown Snow White as she shaves
wood for a fire. She's done this every day for years. A
regimen. Her hands work precisely as she stacks the wood and
blows on the kindling.
29 OMITTED 29

29a OMITTED 29a
The fire is now burning and Snow White warms her hands on it.
She hears APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. Unusual. She jumps up gets
in her bed and pretends to sleep.
A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds
later the door CLANGS SHUT.
As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her
cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell.
SNOW WHITE
Hello?... What's your name?
Rose, sitting in a dark corner, goes to her cell bars and
looks out.
ROSE
I am Rose.
Snow White smiles - a friendly face.
Ravenna stands, attended by MAIDS, in a black gown, open in
front. Appropriate in private but not when --
Ravenna's GENERALS and Finn stand across from her. The
Generals avert their eyes, made uncomfortable by her near
nakedness.
The General uses a pointer to make his presentation while
another holds a map.
BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
There are scattered rebel groups on the
fringe of the dark forest, but they cause
little harm.

31 CONTINUED: 31
She dips her fingers into a bowl of DEAD SONGBIRDS, plucks
out a tiny heart and eats it as she listens, not happy.
RAVENNA
And what of the Duke?
BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
We have pushed his forces into the
mountains but his stronghold at Carmath
holds firm.
RAVENNA
Lay siege to it.
ANOTHER GENERAL
The mountains and fortress provide
impenetrable protection, my Queen.
RAVENNA
Then lure him out! Burn every village
that supports him. Poison their wells.
If they still resist put their heads on
pikes to decorate the roads!
BLACK KNIGHT GENERAL
My Queen.
(chooses words carefully)
They have taken the fight to us. Rebels
harry our supply lines and rob our pay
wagons.
ANOTHER GENERAL
We have just captured two of the rebel
leaders. They will be put to the sword.
RAVENNA
I wish to interrogate them myself.
She drops her robe and walks up the steps to her bath. She
lowers herself into the white liquid. Her face disappears
beneath the viscous liquid, then she rises, like a porcelain
statue.
17
ECU - A small songbird, it's chest open, revealing a small
heart. Ravenna's claw plucks the tiny heart and we follow it
to her mouth.
She is dressed now and stands at a window, Finn at her side.
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW - A CROWD OF STARVING PEASANTS at the foot
of the castle, fight over the milk pouring from her bath.
RAVENNA
(TO HERSELF)
I won't go back.
She is lost for a moment, then...
RAVENNA
Finn, do you remember when we were
children, begging for scraps like those
wretches?
FINN
Yes, my Queen.
RAVENNA
Am I not kinder?
Rose and Snow White converse...
ROSE
All the girls in our village were taken.
I was trying to reach safe haven at Duke
Hammond's castle when I was caught --
Snow White bursts with hope --
SNOW WHITE
The Duke?! He's alive?! He still fights
in my father's name?!
Rose stares at the feral girl now, realizing who she is.
ROSE
You're the king's daughter? Princess?...
The night the evil one's reign began we
were told all in the castle were put to
the sword. How were you spared?
SNOW WHITE
William? What about William?!
The Duke's son?! Is he alive?!
(CONTINUED)

ROSE
I don't know, princess.
Rose shakes her head, still gazing at Snow White, then hears
the distant cries of other female prisoners.
ROSE
What will they do to me?
18
Ravenna sweeps into the great hall.
The Generals and Finn snap to attention. She stops and stares
at TWO MEN, the captured insurgents.
THOMAS, a grizzled old rebel, looks badly bruised and beaten,
while his handsome son, LAIN, is unmarked. They both stare at
her defiantly.
Ravenna faces the two rebels. A SOLDIER steps forward.
SOLDIER
My Queen, these two were captured leading
an ambush of our supply caravan.
Ravenna seems intrigued, steps forward, eyeing them.
RAVENNA
You left your home, your family, the bosom
of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why?
THOMAS
Because under your rule we have lost
everything. We will not stop until this
kingdom is free.
RAVENNA
Lost everything?
(REGARDS IAIN)
Your son?
She moves to Iain, right up to his face.
RAVENNA
Very handsome.
(TO THOMAS)
Obviously a debt owed to your wife.
She reaches out and touches Iain's strong jaw. He struggles
against the Guards that hold him back.
RAVENNA
There was a time I would have lost my heart
to a face like yours -- and you would have
no doubt broken mine.
In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into
Ravenna's chest. She makes a pained face, looks down at the
dagger, then up to Iain.
RAVENNA
You would kill your Queen?
She pulls the dagger out - there is no"wound, no blood - and
drops it on the ground. Iain and Thomas are shocked.
(CONTINUED)
19
33 CONTINUED: 33
RAVENNA
(admiring; to Iain)
You have beauty. And courage. But how
strong is your heart?
She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his
chest. We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND LOUDER.
He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his
ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead.
Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son.
Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her hand.
RAVENNA
No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of
the generosity of his Queen.
With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that
we see the lines on her face. Finn takes her by the arm as she
falters.
FINN
Are you alright?
Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously. The General and the
others stare, alarmed.
RAVENNA
(TO ALL)
OUT!!!!!
They quickly exit, all save Finn, who watches, concerned, as
Ravenna leans against the wall for support. She pulls
herself together, looks at Finn.
FINN
Magic comes at a lofty price.
RAVENNA
And the expense grows.
FINN
You look...
RAVENNA
old?...
FINN
Tired.
RAVENNA
My powers... fade.
This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches
as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he
turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn
nods.
20
Ravenna walks into the room. Eyes the mirror, afraid to look
at herself.
FINN (O.S.)
I have something for what ails you.
She turns to see --
Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles.
Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires
her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and --
LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but
instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth,
DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming,
her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until
she's as old as the scullery maids.
Snow White hears approaching footsteps and watches as a Guard
opens Greta's cell and tosses someone in.
SNOW WHITE
Rose?...
The Guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away.
Snow White peers through the shadows. Can't quite make her
out.
SNOW WHITE
Rose?...
DISSOLVE TO:
RAVENNA stares into her mirror now, rejuvenated.
RAVENNA
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
Who is the fairest of them all?
The bronze ripples. The Mirror Man pours out and reforms.
MIRROR MAN
My Queen, you have defied nature and
robbed it of its fairest fruit. But on
this day there is one more beautiful than
you.
RAVENNA
More beautiful, but --

Ravenna is shocked by this, staggers a bit.
RAVENNA
Snow White?
(CALLS OUT)
Finn'.'.
(back to mirror)
I should have killed her as a child. She
is my undoing?
MIRROR MAN
She is also your treasure, Queen. It was
wise to have kept her close for the
innocence and purity that can destroy can
also heal. Hold her heart in your hands
and you shall never again need to consume
youth. You shall never again weaken or
age. Immortality without cost!
Ravenna laughs, overjoyed.
Finn appears out of the shadows. All he sees is his sister
laughing, giddily into her mirror, no sign of the mirror man,
as if it exists only in her head.
FINN
Yes, Queen?...
36-37OMITTED 36-37
Snow White paces in her cell, frantic.
Two magpies appear in the window. She looks at them and
watches as they flap their wings. Like they're trying to
tell her something. She moves toward them.
They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside
the cell window, hovering there.
She is confused but notices --
A roofing nail, right where the Magpies hover.
Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the
loose nail. Her fingers move it back and forth as it, bit by
bit, breaks free.
She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when --
The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid --

38 CONTINUED: 38
Snow White hears FOOTSTEPS down the hall.
She steadies herself, yanks once, twice and the nail comes
loose.
she jumps down, lies in her bed again just as --
Finn unlocks her door, leaving the key in the lock, and walks
into the cell. He stands there until she turns her head
slightly to him.
She doesn't move, grips the nail in her closed hand as she
tries to lure him closer with her eyes.
FINN
Did I wake you?
Snow White shakes her head gently.
FINN
Are you always awake when I watch you?
SNOW WHITE
(HOARSELY)
Yes.
She looks away.
SNOW WHITE
You've never come in before.
FINN
My Queen won't allow it. She wants you
all to herself.
SNOW WHITE
I'm afraid of her.
FINN
Not of me.
SNOW WHITE
No.
He can't help himself, reaches out and touches her arm.
FINN
It's alright, princess. You will never
again be locked in a cell.
SNOW WHITE
What does she want from me?
His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it
gently, and then to her chest. With his free hand he reaches
back for his dagger.
(CONTINUED)

38 CONTINUED: (2) 38
FINN
Your beating heart.
Snow White grips the roofing nail even tighter as she looks
at him. As he leans closer, she notices his off hand - the
dagger and --
She SLASHES him across the face with the nail. Blood flies.
Finn reacts, grabs his face in pain, yells and Snow White
kicks him and runs for the door, locking it behind --
23
Snow White hurtles down the steps to Greta's cell. She is
shocked by what she sees. Rose, now an old woman, looks to her.
Snow White fumbles with the keys. Rose holds out both her
hands. Snow White takes them, looks into her eyes.
ROSE
Go.
Finn stumbles to the cell door, clutching his face.
FINN
GUARDS!
Snow White tosses the keys into an empty cell and races away.
Snow White runs down the steps into a corridor and sees ARMED
GUARDS appear at the other end. She hurries into another tower,
bolting the door shut behind her, and charges down the steps.
Snow White splashes through the deep stinking sludge.
From above we see Ravenna striding furiously in a circle of
her own. She is livid, a whirling dervish.
She's fairly spitting as she barks at Finn, who stands in the
middle of the room, his face bleeding.
RAVENNA
How is it an innocent young girl makes a
fool of my brother?! Armed only with a
nail?! If she'd had a sword she'd have
taken the whole castle!
We're in front of her, behind her, on her face, on her feet --
She picks up the pace as well as the volume --
RAVENNA
You swore to protect me! Do you not
understand what, the girl means to us?!
This is my future! This is everything.

looks at her.
FINN
She was chased into the dark forest.
She's likely already dead.
She SCREAMS and slaps him viciously.
RAVENNA
She's no good to me there, lost. I must
have her heart! You have failed me!
Finn's had enough, he erupts at her --
FINN
Have I not given all to you?!
She takes this, softens, unexpectedly, and almost smiles.
RAVENNA
Have I not given you all? All.
She raises her finger and touches his face. His wound heals
instantly and his face grows calm. He nods.
FINN
Indeed, my Queen.

RAVENS perch on the ledges and LURCHERS scamper about.
Eric, still drunk, filthy, damp clothes, face bruised, enters

Ravenna on her throne. She watches him curiously. He's more
interested in the aged scullery maids, including Rose, who are
staring at him accusingly. He has no idea who they are or what
he's done wrong. Finally he comes before the Queen, sizing her
up like a tavern beauty.

RAVENNA
She.
She shoots Finn a pointed look then looks back at Eric.
ERIC
Then she is certainly dead.

Find her. Bring her to me.
Eric holds her gaze, uneasy at the request.

I've been to the Dark Forest enough times
to know I'm not going back.
RAVENNA
You will be rewarded handsomely.
ERIC
Coin's no good to me if I'm lying dead
with crows picking at my eyes.
Ravenna steps off her throne now, approaching him.
RAVENNA
There may be more than gold in the
offing.
ERIC
Why is her life of such value?

Eric reacts instinctively, grabbing her by the throat. The
courtiers rise to their feet and the guards draw their
swords, but Ravenna holds up her hand.
ERIC
My wife is none of your concern.
Something about her face, the fact that she enjoys his hand
on her throat makes Eric queasy. He releases his grip,
stares right at Ravenna.
RAVENNA
My condolences.
Ravenna holds his gaze.
RAVENNA
You miss her?
His eyes say, yes, he misses her horribly.
RAVENNA
What would you give to bring her back?
Eric stares at her curiously.
RAVENNA
You know of my powers. Bring me the girl
and I will bring back your wife.
ERIC
Nothing will bring her back.
Ravenna moves even closer, looks him right in the eye. She
is incredibly persuasive as she says --
RAVENNA
I can. Believe me, huntsman.
Eric's eyes say he wants to believe. Needs to believe.

A life for a life.
Grim faced COMMANDERS look on as DUKE HAMMOND comforts a
sobbing man in the firelight. We recognise the old rebel,
THOMAS, whose son was killed by Ravenna.
THOMAS
She killed brave Lain with only her palm

Duke Hammond has heard enough, turns to leave.

We don't know if she survived --
Duke Hammond grabs him by the arm.
DUKE HAMMOND
You ventured beyond the walls tonight,
disobeying my orders. We are all that's

any more of my men.
WILLIAM
Then I will go alone.
DUKE HAMMOND
And I cannot afford to lose my only heir!
You do not know the dark forest!

William pulls away.
WILLIAM
I will not abandon her a second time.
Snow White lies in her bed. Nearby sleep Anna and Lily.
SNOW WHITE
She's so beautiful.

SNOW WHITE

ANNA
Sleep my dear. You must rest.
She leaves.
Snow White awakens. Looks around, no Eric, puts it in her
pocket. Then smells smoke, walks outside and looks up to see --
The sky BLAZES WITH BURNING ARROWS all raining down on the
village.
Snow White re-enters the hut just as A FLAMING ARROW pierces
through the thatch and sticks next to Lily's sleeping head.
Snow White pushes Lily away from the fire and grabs the
arrow. Anna SCREAMS because -
A MERCENARY races into the hut.
On impulse Snow White backhand STABS HIM in the leg WITH THE
FLAMING ARROW and he tumbles, flames burning his clothes.
Snow White stares at him for a moment, his face, his pain.
Anna shakes her out of the moment and they all race out.

What did you say?
Then she's right in her face --
RAVENNA
WHAT DID YOU SAY!
The "old woman" just stares at her, shakes her head. There's
something in the woman's eyes that terrifies Ravenna. She
backs up, retreating, then scurries away.
Ravenna sits alone, naked. Her spine stretches through her
taut skin.
In front of her sits the CROWN on a dark cushion, a matted

her hair.

The word echoes in the palace --
From their hidden vantage point, Eric, Snow White, and the
dwarves watch the riders searching for them. Some gallop on, but
a small troop remain behind. Realizing they have no choice but
to retreat further, Duir and Coll signal and the dwarves follow
them deeper into the cave system.
63
A shaft of light pours through the cave roof high above, BATS
circling. The dwarves move effortlessly down the labyrinth but
Snow White and the huntsman have to squeeze through the cracks.
Ravenna sits at her desk - she is small and alone in the
vastness of the hall.
She stares off into space, a quill in her hand - parchments laid
out before her.
Then suddenly her body convulses - the bottle of black ink
spills - dark tendrils of liquid seep across the papers and onto
the floor.
RAVENNA
Finn ...no!
She falls to the floor - writhing.
She fights hard at first - but then begins to weaken - her
power fades as she ages.
Then she stops.
RAVENNA
Forgive me, brother.
142 ENCHANTED FOREST - DAY. 142
Finn gasps as he feels Ravenna cut him off. Reacts in horror and
heartbreak as his wounds stop trying to heal.
FINN
Sister...
Finn twitches for a moment, looks to Eric.
FINN
I feel...
Then the light goes out of his eyes. He is finally dead.
Slowly, Eric pulls himself free of the branches cutting into his
flesh.
72A
She has broken their connection. We pull away from her.
Ravenna's head is down, depleted, forlorn. Completely still.
Ink pools around her bony hands. But when she raises her head --
We see conviction, hatred and determination.

RAVENNA
You will pay. You will pay!!!
From above - Ravenna stands in the center of the room,
surrounded by ravens. She raises her arms and they take
flight, circling above her. She lowers her arms and their
swirling pattern lowers, until she is completely surrounded
by them - a tornado of ravens.
She has become them, and they her.
The ravens burst into the mirror room and "crash" to the
ground. Their swirl becomes --
Ravenna, on all fours, looking worse for wear, surrounded by
dead ravens. The effort depleted her. She GROWLS as she
crawls toward the mirror.
RAVENNA
What must I do?! Where is she?! Where
have they taken her?! Answer me!
The mirror just REFLECTS RAVENNA'S weary and aging face.
RAVENNA
ANSWER ME!!!!
Nothing. Ravenna releases it all, looks up and quietly
pleads...
RAVENNA
help me...
MIRROR MAN
(MOCKS HER)
"Help me?"...
(BEAT)
There is nothing more pathetic than
grovelling desperation. You sicken me, my
Queen.
The mirror starts to ripple, distorting Ravenna's face into
something even more awful.
Crowds move in to see and mourn the processional. Eric is
careful to lower his eyes a bit to keep from being
recognized.
Torchlight flickers. Snow White's body is laid out on a
funeral bier, her face angelic in death.
63
Tent flaps open. William stands before Duke Hammond and his
council of LORDS, arguing his case with fierce passion --
WILLIAM
She died for us! For our cause! We cannot
hide behind these walls and watch this
land die with her!
DUKE HAMMOND
Your grief clouds your judgement, my son.
WILLIAM
My grief makes me see clearly, father.
Eric steps from the shadows up to Snow White's body, flask in
hand. Drunk.
ERIC
Here you are. Where it ends. Dressed Up
to pretty.
He takes another pull from the flask.
ERIC
Like you're asleep; about to wake-up and
give me more grief. Am I right?
The he touches her arm. Feels the fabric of her funeral
dress. Looks at her face and breaks a bit - losing the
drunken swagger and speaking with her as if she was still
alive.
ERIC
You deserved better.
And then he answers her...
ERIC
She was my wife, princess. That was your
question that went unanswered. Sara was
her name. When I came back from the wars
I carried with me the stench of death and
the anger of the lost. I wasn't worth
saving. But she did so anyway. I loved
her more than anything or anyone. And
then I let her out of my sight and she
was gone and I became myself again. A
self I never cared for. Until you. You
remind me of her. Her spirit. Her
heart. And now you, too, are gone. You
both deserved better. And I'm sorry to
have failed you as well.

163a CONTINUED: 163a
Snow White lies pale and motionless on the bier. Eric reaches
down and gently brushes a strand of hair off her face.
ERIC
You will be a Queen in heaven now...
He leans down and kisses her lips.
ERIC
And sit among the angels.
He finally turns and leaves the chamber, tossing the flask
aside, disgusted with himself.
As we listen to his footsteps fade we hold on Snow White's
beautiful face. For a long time she stays perfectly still,
THEN --
Her lips part ever so slightly, and she lets out an almost
inaudible whisper of breath.
(CONTINUED)
84
163a CONTINUED: (2) 163a
Snow White's eyes open, gazing up at the ceiling, her
thoughts far away. There's a strange calm about her now, a
quiet acceptance, as if she knows what she must do.

The council session continues. Duke Hammond stares at
William gravely.
DUKE HAMMOND
My duty is to protect the people who come
to me for help. I will defend them with
my last drop of blood but I will not
abandon these walls. I cannot afford to
believe in miracles.
He suddenly stops as the SHOUTS outside the tent get louder.
He goes to the flap, opens it to see --
Snow White , still dressed in her white funeral robes, stands
at the top of the stairs that leads down into the courtyard.
Ravenna raises her head to look into the mirror.
MIRROR MAN
Yes, my Queen! Yes!!!!
The Mirror Man laughs because Ravenna's face is younger, her
energy has returned and we see why when --
WE PULL BACK to reveal several CRONES, young only minutes
before, now old and lying on the floor.
Ravenna smiles, girding herself for the fight to come.

The GUARDS in the gatehouse look over as the door splinters and
the dwarves come crashing through in their battle masks. Even
though they're outnumbered, the seven fight like demons -- until
the enemy are subdued.
A huge pulley controls the portcullis. Beith, Gort and Nion draw
their pickaxes while Coll and Duir tie up the guards.
BEITH
Now let's see how this works! --
With a mighty blow of his axe, Beith shatters the chains holding
up the pulley. The counter weights go flying down and the
portcullis comes shooting up -- then suddenly stops -- JAMMED.
93
Beith peers down at the jammed counter-weights in frustration
when he hears a fierce cry. GORT jumps on the counter-weight,
trying to bring it down. Nion follows, yellingatthetopofhis
voice. Duir puffs up his proud chest and leapsontoo--
Snow White storms into the throne room. She is breathing
heavily, a mix of fear and determination.
KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK
The raven claw ring, taps, resonating through the halls.
Ravenna stands at the top of the stairs, the mirror room
behind her.
Snow White approaches.
SNOW WHITE
It ends today... I have come for YOU!
RAVENNA
(MOCKINGLY)
My rose has returned
(looking at Gus' small sword)
.with a thorn!

Eric, William and a dozen men rush in.
Ravenna smiles, raises her hand.
RAVENNA
I'll show you thorns!
In a terrifying tremor, the black ceiling of the throne room
starts to shatter into millions of shards.
Snow White turns back to see William, Eric and Hammond's men -
the shards fall down like razor blades.
The men try to protect themselves. Some are caught out and
skewered to the stone floor. Ravenna looks down at them in
complete satisfaction.
The millions of black shards circle around Eric and his men,
completely blocking them and keeping them away from Snow
White.
RAVENNA
Come! ... Avenge your father, who was too
weak to raise his sword.
The millions of shards assemble themselves into three seven
foot tall, razor sharp creatures. The DARK FAERIES: Ravenna's
ultimate soldiers.
Snow White looks at Eric and William - unable to help her.
(CONTINUED)
96
209a CONTINUED: 209a
Eric, William and the other men are completely surrounded by
these creatures; they move so fast. Eric tries to step away
from them... to no avail.
One of the creatures rises in front of William.
William tries to slash the creature.
His sword goes through and the creature reforms itself right
away. The Dark Faerie opens it's mouth and screeches.
William gets smashed aside, saved only by his shield. The
Dark Faerie grabs the soldier right behind William and sends
him crashing into the wall.
Snow White walks up the stairs, torn and powerless.
She looks at Eric one last time.
Eric looks back as he fights off a Dark Faerie with his two
shields. He knows he does not have much time left but he is
ready to make the final sacrifice.
ERIC
(battle cry!)
Kill her!
Snow White braces herself and promptly follows Ravenna into
the mirror room. Now Snow White is exactly where Ravenna
wants her to be.
The two women circle each other like heavyweight boxers.
SNOW WHITE
Ten years you locked me away!
Ravenna seems to relish this.
RAVENNA
And every day, every hour led you to this
,moment. It burned inside you. It drove
you forward, and here you are..
Listening only to her heart, Snow White lunges towards
Ravenna and tries - strikes at her with her sword.
Ravenna steps aside and with very little effort - throws her
to the other side of the room.
RAVENNA
That's it. Fight. Fight for your land...
for your loss and for Hope!
(CONTINUED)
96A
209b CONTINUED: 209b
Snow White slams and slides across the floor, she stops under
the archway at the top of the stairs. She is dazed.
Ravenna treads on her back, then grabs her hair, pulls her
head up to see William and his men being massacred.
RAVENNA
Watch them die. You gave them hope and
they believed you. You have lead them to
their deaths. How foolish your followers.
97
Eric is trying to stay alive. He rams a Faerie into a pillar.
Shredding the stone, the Faerie explodes in shards and
reforms immediately behind Eric.
Grabbing the first man in sight, the Faerie throws the poor
soldier to the other side of the room.
on the opposite side another Faerie slides faster than the
blink of an eye, grabs the man in flight extending it's
cutting limbs and claws the soldier to his death.
It is like carnage in slow motion.
209d OMITTED 209d
209e MOVED TO 209B 209e
William is being overrun by a school of shards. The shards
shape up into a Faerie taking William up high. In a violent
arm blow, the Faerie projects William onto the banquet table
six feet lower. The table shatters in splinters, William
bouncing like a rag doll.
Spinning around on it's way down, the Faerie skewers a
soldier and impales another one into a pillar. The Faerie
drags him ten feet up, tearing and digging deep into the
stone column.
Enraged, Snow White jolts her body and frees herself from
Ravenna's grasp.
She swings her sword at Ravenna. She parries every attack
with her bare hands.
Snow White is breathless. One more strike... but Ravenna
blocks it again, and this time she doesn't let go.
(CONTINUED)
97A
211 CONTINUED: 211
RAVENNA
(face to face with Snow White)
You were never ready for this princess!
Snow White struggles to get out of her lock. Ravenna is too
strong.
Snow White's wrist is twisted. She holds her sword tight but
can't use it. Ravenna forces the twist. Her fragile bones
crack.
Snow White screams in pain.
The sword drops on the ground.
SNOW WHITE
(GRUNTING)
I will... defeat... you... I am the
only...
RAVENNA
Oh... please!
Ravenna back hands Snow White, sending her crashing to the
wall. SLAM! Cuts on her face.
Ravenna looms closer, through the fire in the middle of the
room. She stands IN the fire, unaffected.
For Snow White it is a vision of pure hell. So much power, so
much hate.
RAVENNA
I have lived many lives. Ravaged entire
kingdoms, I have been given powers you
can't fathom. You cannot defeat ME?
.you are but a child!
(LAUGHING)
Ravenna's skin blisters and heals. Ravenna raises her arms
and black shards start to cover the walls behind her...
entombing them in darkness... the trap closes.
RAVENNA
But you are right... it is over.
Ravenna's laughter pierces Snow White like a dagger.
She feels powerless and lost, spitting blood and exhausted.
What else can she do?
Snow White stands up, stumbles, her right arm limp, blood
dripping down her face.
She stares at Ravenna, she won't back down... she will never
back down.
97B
William, stumbling upon the dead bodies of his comrades, sees
the shards starting to obstruct the entry of the mirror room.
He runs towards it. Eric sees him and goes for it too.
Behind William and in front of Eric, a Dark creature shapes
up. William doesn't see it.
The Faerie claws William from behind through his armor,
stopping him still and sending him backwards against a pillar
like a stone ricochet.
The Faerie spins it's head 180 degrees and goes from turning
its back to Eric... to facing the huntsman.
Eric stops and tries to pull back.
The Faerie powers up gathering shards from another creature,
doubling in size and density.
Like a fire hose of black shards, the Dark Faerie unloads a
stream of razor blades at Eric.
Eric digs his heels in... slowly grinds and slides on the
floor, double shields up.
The shields are being shredded. One shield gives way
completely torn slicing Eric's arm.
Eric has one shield left. He kneels down... it is a matter of
seconds.
Ravenna approaches and grabs Snow White by the throat,
squeezing hard.
Snow White is chocking.
RAVENNA
I will never stop... I will give this
wretched world the Queen it deserves...
Ravenna slams Snow White down onto the stone floor next to
the mirror altar.
Snow White stretches for her sword as Ravenna approaches.
Ravenna un-sheaths her dagger.
RAVENNA
(TO HERSELF)
A life .for a life.
(CONTINUED)
97C
213 CONTINUED: 213
Snow White tries to reach her sword with her left hand, but
it is too far. She tries to drag herself a little closer...
still too far.
Ravenna straddles Snow White, raises her dagger above her
head - smiling, relishing the imminent death blow. The black
tomb has closed in around them.
Eric watches - despair wrought on his face -- as the knife
falls.
RAVENNA
(in a spell incantation)
By fairest blood it is done!
Ravenna strikes... in the blink of an eye Snow White blocks
her strike, reaches for her dagger and plunges it into
Ravenna's chest, just as the huntsman taught her.
Ravenna gasps, locks eyes with Snow White.
SNOW WHITE
(whispers to Ravenna)
By fairest blood... it is undone!
Ravenna looks down. Three drops of blood fall onto Snow
White's armor.
BOOM... BOOM... BOOM
Ravenna stares in shock and disbelief.
RAVENNA
NO!
She pulls out the dagger, her face starts to age.
Ravenna is aging at an incredible pace. Her body gives way
and she slumps to the floor, below the mirror.
She looks at the mirror above her, gasping, reaching out, her
pale eyes looking for a friend, a miracle... but nothing.
The black shards that entombed the room start to shatter and
fall to the floor.
William is on the ground, out of strength and has given up
the fight. A dark creature is slowly close to reaching
William's face with his sharp claws as William tries to hold
the creature's arm with his bare hands, severely bleeding.
(CONTINUED)
97CA
214 CONTINUED: 214
The Faeries have slowed down dramatically. Eric grabs a sword
on the ground and slices the Faerie in front of him... the
Faerie shatters.
William looks at Eric, in desperation begging for help. The
two men lock eyes. A silent understanding.
(CONTINUED)
97D
214 CONTINUED: (2) 214
Eric throws his sword and blows the other Dark Faerie in
pieces, releasing William.
A silent pact has been made at this moment between the two
men.
The remaining Dark Creature freezes. Eric and William are
barely alive.
98
Snow White approaches Ravenna and kneels beside her, Ravenna
is weak. She ages dozens of years within seconds, her face
shows no anger, no hate, just a strange understanding.
SNOW WHITE
Why this? Why all of this?
Snow White, overwhelmed by compassion, places her hand on
Ravenna's chest. Ravenna puts her own wrinkled hand on Snow
White's.
Ravenna smiles. She gently taps on Snow White's... in a
strange and affectionate motherly way.
Eric and William, exhausted and battered climb the steps of
the mirror chamber. It is over.
Ravenna stares up at Snow White's face in a shining halo of
light above her from the ceiling.
RAVENNA
(whispering to Snow White)
See child,... we are bound.
SNOW WHITE
(whispers to Ravenna calming)
It will be all right...
Ravenna whispers incomprehensible words with a peaceful smile
on her face. The clouds move in the disc of light above Snow
White. The light falls over Ravenna's face.
The light fades out of her eyes and she dies.
In death, Ravenna's beautiful blue eyes are wide open, fixed on
the halo of light that surrounds Snow White's head.

SNOW WHITE
Backlit in a golden hue. A crown is placed on her head.
We're in...
Packed for the coronation. Duke Hammond and Bishops surround
her. Snow White smiles and looks out at all assembled - her
subjects, her friends, the people she's come to know and love
- meeting the eyes of Rose, looking young and beautiful again
-- Anna and Lily -- the seven dwarves, who all wipe away
tears.
She sees William off to the side, smiling, looking on
adoringly. But her eyes continue through the crowd, looking
FOR --
Eric, in the very back of the cathedral, near the door.
Their eyes meet, as if they're the only two in the room.
This lasts several moments until --
BEITH
Hail to the Queen!
And then the huntsman smiles and leaves.
ERIC V/0
The land was healed, and the rightful Queen
brought an age of peace and prosperity.
