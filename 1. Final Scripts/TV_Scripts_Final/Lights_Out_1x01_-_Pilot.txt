                                          TEASER

      SOUNDS OF CHILDREN PLAYING...

      OPEN TIGHT ON A PAIR OF LIFELESS EYES, staring out a car 
      window through the reflection of CHILDREN clinging to a 
      spinning merry-go-round...

                    It s been said that the eyes are 
                    the windows to the soul.

      The eyes BLINK as the merry-go-round spins faster...

                    These are the eyes of Lights Out 
                    Leary... It s been said that they 
                    are the windows to somewhere 
                    else...

      Until one of the children, a YOUNG BOY flies off the merry-go-
      round and SMASHES into the window of the car...

      PATRICK  LIGHTS OUT  LEARY (40 s), Black Irish, with a dense, 
      wiry build hidden but for his thick hands and the cord-like 
      veins that buttress his neck, covers his head with his arms 
      to avoid the shattering glass...which never comes.

      He peers up to see the window...intact. The children continue 
      to play... He rubs his eyes and sighs...

      EXT. WATERFRONT HOUSE - AFTERNOON

      As Lights climbs out of the car, a  64 Shelby Cobra Daytona 
      Coupe, popping a handful of Bayer and loosening his tie as he 
      walks across the street to a beautiful, waterfront house.

      rolls her eyes...

                    between root canals.

      Roger rises to answer the doorbell, smacks his flat 
      stomach...

                    alpha-dog in this kennel.

      He actually barks before glancing in the hall mirror to 
      admire his physique on his way to opening the front door 
      revealing Lights.

                                  LIGHTS
                    Likewise, Roger.

      They stand there for a beat, Roger is both unsure of why and 
      amazed that Lights is at his door.

      The guests share incredulous looks as Lights helps himself to 
      a bit of everything. All the alpha-dogness has shifted away 
      from Roger.

                                  LIGHTS

                    Really? My wife doesn t cook 
                    either.

      Roger cracks up.

                    It s pronounced Ayn.

                                  ROGER
                    Who gives a shit.

                    But, the man s still expected to be 
                    the earner. Food on the table,

                    Maybe more in your case. Right Rog?

      Roger fakes a smile, unsure if he just got dinged. Lights 
      continues gorging himself...

                                  LIGHTS (CONT D)
                    But where are the studies about the 
                    kids? My mom died when I was young,

      A MONTAGE of JUMP-CUTS beneath the series theme song: BOB 
      DYLAN S  SERIES OF DREAMS  as Lights drives home; passes a 
      McDonalds; pulls a U-turn and into the drive-through; waits 
      in line while singing (badly) along with the song; orders; 
      pulls into a parking space; downs several Big Macs and fries 
      and cokes and a sundae; throws the wrappers away; wipes the 
      crumbs off his car seat; drives away...all beneath the 
      following:

            I was thinking of a series of dreams
            Where the time and the tempo drag,
          And there s no exit in any direction
             Cept the one that you can t see with your eyes.
            Wasn t making any great connections,
            Wasn t falling for any intricate schemes.
            Nothing that would pass inspection,
          I se just thinking of a series of dreams.
            Dreams where the umbrella is folded,
          And into the path you are hurled,
          And the cards are no good that you re holding
            Unless they re from another world.
          I d already gone the distance,
          Just thinking of a series of dreams.

      (note: while the theme song will remain constant, the credit 
      sequence will feature a different montage of Lights doing

      INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

      LIGHTS  EYES -- squinting as a lighting technician adjusts 
      his key light... 

                                  BOB COSTAS (V.O.)
                    These are the eyes of Lights Out 
                    Leary. It s been said that they are 
                    the windows to somewhere else... 

      Makeup is applied as a lavaliere mic is clipped to his lapel. 
      His mind is elsewhere...

      EXT. LEARY ESTATE - NIGHT

      The front gate swings open admitting the car which heads down 
      the long, leafy driveway...

      EXT. LEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

      An immense  French Country  McMansion. Lights  car pulls into 
      the garage next to a Mercedes McLaren.

      He climbs out, singing badly...

      ...and walks up to the door where a blank, pink Post-It waits 
      for him...

      He pulls it off and checks the back before closing the garage 
      door and entering the house...

      INT. LEARY KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Huge. Custom cabinetry and marble counter-tops. He drops his 
      keys in a bowl. LIGHTS OUT "Pilot"  1/30/09                              12.

                    Hello?

      He walks out to a grand staircase, picks another pink Post-It 
      off the banister and heads upstairs.

      INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Lights crests the stairs and follows a trail of torn Post-It 
       petals  down the decidedly feminine hallway. (In fact the 
      whole house has a feminine feeling to it.)

      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

      He enters. The lights dimmed. Soft music plays...

                                  LIGHTS
                    Somebody here?

      A rustling is heard behind a door. He pulls it open revealing 
      his wife s enormous walk-in closet.

      A young woman, THERESA, stands in her bra and panties, caught 
      in the act of slipping on a beaded ball gown.

                                    THERESA
                    Oh my god.

      He grabs her roughly by the elbow and pulls her out of the 
      closet.

      slightly...

      She pushes her panties down to the floor, then slips her

      INT. LEARY BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Reflected in the mirror above the bed, Lights fucks her 
      doggie-style, his fingers entwined in her hair, bowing her 
      head back with one hand and pinning her wrists behind her 
      with the other...

      He climbs out of bed.

      INT. LEARY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Where Theresa stands in front of the mirror dressed in a 
      business suit. She opens a drawer and selects a matching

      Where half the bar stands in the back alleyway. Lights stands 
      still, looking decidedly old and mortal as the Big Yuppie 
      removes his jacket, pumping himself up with his friends.

                    Okay, then--

      He swings. Lights swats his fist aside. The Big Yuppie 
      punches again, Lights leans back, avoiding the punch.

      Finally, the Big Yuppie lands a blow to Lights  mid-section. 
      Lights doubles over and sinks to the ground.

      The Big Yuppie raises his hands in victory. But Lights pulls 
      himself to his feet and starts walking towards him.

                                  LIGHTS

      Lights bolts upright from the dream. Theresa s side of the

      staggers out of bed and into...

      stands over him, knuckles split open, spit mingled with

      INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

      Lights nods almost imperceptibly...

                                  BOB COSTAS
                    What do you feel about that? Where 
                    does it come from?

      Lights stares back at him...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. LEARY ESTATE - NIGHT

      Seen through a window, Theresa comes to the end of a story 
      book. Katherine is passed out in her lap.LIGHTS OUT "Pilot"  1/30/09                              64.

                    When I was a kid, there was this 
                      merry-go-round in the park across 
                    the street from my house.

      Theresa puts Katherine in bed then looks out the window, 
      wondering where her husband is before she closes the blind...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. WATERFRONT HOUSE - NIGHT

      Where Roger, the dentist, and his wife, Heather, talk quietly 
      at the dinner table.

                                  LIGHTS (V.O.)
                    I used to sit on and do my homework 
                    until my folks wore themselves out.

      Suddenly, Roger lashes out with his good arm and knocks her 
      out of her chair.

                                  ROGER
                    You happy now?! Huh?!

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. ROBERT S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Where Robert watches an old tape of Lights, boxing in his 
      prime. 

                                  LIGHTS (V.O.)
                    I used to get it going really, 
                    really fast until everything around 
                    me became a blur.

      The round ends and Lights goes to his corner where Robert 
      coaches him fiercely.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:LIGHTS OUT "Pilot"  1/30/09                              65.


      EXT. THE MAT - NIGHT

      And the mural of Lights painted on the bricks. The CAMERA 
      PUSHES FORWARD towards one of the illuminated windows and we 
        SPLIT-SCREEN/HALF DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY (SPLIT/DISSOLVE)

                                  LIGHTS
                    That s the only feeling that ever 
                    made it go away.

      The CAMERA finally arrives at the window, through which we 
      see Lights, in the ring, teaching Jared how to work the hand 
      pads, in the same place and in the same manner Robert had 
      been working with the Young Man...

      The lights inside The Mat FADE and the image of the interview 
      fills the screen over the colored bricks of the mural that, 
      from this distance, look like weathered pixels seen close up.

                                  BOB COSTAS
                    Made what go away?

      Lights just shrugs. The image FADES, leaving for a moment, 
      the bricks of the mural, before they too FADES TO BLACK.
