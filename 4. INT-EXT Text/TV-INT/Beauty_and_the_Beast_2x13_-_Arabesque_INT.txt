          Vincent sits in his chair, the book of poems open in his
        lap.

                                      VINCENT'S VOICE
                      is moving near me./ I have faith in
                        nights.

        As Vincent finishes reading the poem, Father enters.

                                      FATHER

                        Vincent&

          Vincent gazes up at Father, who seems troubled by some
          distant anguish.

                                      VINCENT
                      What is it, Father?

                                      FATHER
                      A message arrived for you tonight.
                      From above.

        Father draws the sealed envelope from his coat, passes it
        to Vincent. Vincent turns it over in his hands, examines
        his name written in a familiar cursive. He breaks the seal and
        pulls out the Plaza stationery. He reads the short note.


                                      FATHER
                      Is it...?

                                      VINCENT
                      Yes, Father.

                                      FATHER
                      What does she want?

                                      VINCENT
                      To see me.

                                      FATHER
                      When?

                                      VINCENT

                      Midnight.

                                      FATHER
                      She always did have a taste for
                      the theatrical. I wish she'd
                      leave us alone.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          4

                      I'm surprised she hasn't come
                        sooner. I've wanted to see her.

        He and Father exchange a significant look.Father nods
          resignedly and withdraws from the chamber.Vincent regards
        the note once again.

                                                LISA (0.S.)
                        Come and see me at midnight. Our
                        special place. Lisa.

          Vincent eyes lift from the words as if seeing into a time
        long ago.

                                      VINCENT

        Two decades ago. A single lantern hangs from the ceiling,
          sending shards of flickering light into the dark recesses of
        the hall. And young Lisa dances near, a vision of soft
          sensuality in her gossamer dress, which catches and holds the
        light, as she turns closer and closer... For a second she is
        still, and her full face turns toward us, flawless and
        alluring, but before we can drink it in, she moves away
        becoming beautiful motion again.

        Moving with Vincent as he walks slowly through the tunnels
          heading toward the park entrance. His thoughts filled with the
          turmoil of reawakened memories of his teenage years.
          A voice enters his consciousness.

                                      YOUNG LISA (OVER)

                      I will be dancing only for you.

          The sweetness of these innocent words touches Vincent even
          now. The power and purity of first love. He moves PAST THE
          CAMERA, steering down a long tunnel.

                                                                      CUT TO:



          Vincent arrives in this small chamber, hidden underneath the
          first balcony. Some old theater seats are stacked against one
          wall, and a thin rectangular grating runs along another near
          the ceiling. The chamber is empty, and after a beat, Vincent
          steps up to the grating, looks through it.

          finally the empty stage.

          Vincent is still waiting. A part of him idealizing this woman
          from the past. Yet an equal part remembering the pain and loss
          he also felt. And it is this second part that now impinges
          upon his memory. First come the sounds.

                                        YOUNG VINCENT (OVER)

            A fifteen-year old Vincent, head bowed, youthful heart
          filled with guilt and recrimination, sits before Father. Who
          holds an equal measure of guilt in his own heart.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                          6.

        Vincent's eyes refocus on the present. Lisa is long overdue,
        and Vincent pulls her note from his cloak -- wondering where
        she could be, and why after all these years she has chosen to
        see him again. He elects to continue waiting for her.


                                                                  CUT TO:



        Cathy makes her way through a bustle of post performance
        activity as dancers mill about on their way to the dressing
        rooms. They step over cables and around flats as stage hands
        break the sets and set up for the next day's performance. Two
          members of the Corps de Ballet, JILL and BETH, are approached
        by MARIE, the wardrobe mistress, carrying an armload of
        costumes. She's a blustery,gregarious, motherly sort.


                                      MARIE
                              (to the dancers)
                      Come on girls, I need those
                        costumes.

                                      JILL
                              (to Marie indicating
                                her costume)
                      Do you think you could take
                      this in on the side?

                                      MARIE
                        What? So you can split the seams
                      next time you eat lunch? I'll
                      be here till three in the morning
                      just fixing the damage you did
                        tonight.

        She grabs Jill's skirt, holding up a tear in the material.

                                    MARIE
                      No go on, both of you, get those
                        costumes to wardrobe.

                                      JILL
                      Okay, okay.

        Jill and Beth saunter off.

                                      MARIE
                              (to herself)
                        Honestly, you'd think I had
                        nothing better to do.

        Cathy catches Marie's attention.

                                      CATHY
                        Excuse me. Can you tell me where
                        Lisa Campbell's dressing room is?

        Marie points down a side corridor.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            9.

                                        MARIE
                        Sure, honey. She's holding court
                        right down there. Third door.

                                        CATHY
                          Thanks.



          Cathy walks past the other dressing rooms as dancers in various
          stages of dress and undress come and go along with bits of
          their conversations. "That stage is like a rock, must be cement
            underneath." "I think I'm getting that solo in 'Sylphides.'"
          "Yeah, sure. You and everybody else Victor's dating." Cathy
          reaches Lisa's dressing room. The door is ajar.




          As Cathy stands in the doorway she sees Lisa at her
          dressing table, surrounded by flowers. She's in a robe but
          still wearing her stage makeup. An elderly, dapper man,
          FRANK, hovers over her, admiring...

                                        FRANK

                          favorite?

                          December 23, 1978.

          Lisa smiles at his ardor.Then, wistfully:

                          beautiful now, Miss Campbell.

                      Did he send you?

                                      CATHY
                      I said I'd try to find you...
                      and see if everything was all
                      right.

        Lisa says nothing. An awkward pause. Cathy realizes that Lisa
        would understandably be skeptical of her...

                                      CATHY
                      Vincent cares for you very much.
                      Know that if you need him, he'll be
                      there for you.

        Lisa begins to soften, but still reveals very little.

                      Yes.

                      Tell him, I'm sorry. I would have
                      come, if I could.
                              (then)
                      Are you a helper?

        The door pushes open behind Cathy, and Collin silently
        steps in... unseen by Cathy, but visible to Lisa who
          immediately changes the tone of their conversation...
        glossing it over with charm and ease.

                                      LISA

                      old and dear friend.

                              (to Collin)
                      Collin, this is Cathy Chandler. We
                      went to school together. Cathy,
                      this is Collin Hemmings.

                                      CATHY
                      How do you do.

        Collin regards Cathy with a level gaze. Then, more a quest for
        information than casual conversation...

                                      COLLIN
                      So you went to school together.
                      Here in New York?

        Cathy glances at Lisa fleetingly instantly sensing her
        tension. Then, to Collin...

                                      CATHY
                      Yes...

                                      COLLIN
                      Which school was that?

        Lisa covers.

                        Brookfield School of the Arts, of
                        course.

        Cathy smiles, keeping up the pretense while trying to sense the
          undercurrents.

                                      CATHY
                              (quickly, to both)
                      Well you probably have plans and I
                      don't want to keep you. I've got to
                      be going anyway.

              Cathy starts for the door.

                        That would be great. We can catch
                        up.
                                (to Collin)
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. Hemmings.

          Collin just nods as Cathy leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:



          Cathy closes the door behind her. She looks back at the
          dressing room, troubled, trying to decipher Lisa's behavior.

                                                                    CUT TO:



          CLOSE TERMINAL SCREEN. We SEE a news photo of Lisa dancing the
          lead in "Les Sylphides" with the Paris National Ballet. The
          caption reads: "Lisa Campbell enchants Paris."

          The film blurs forward to a picture of Lisa on the arm of an
          Italian Count. The caption: "Will dancing's darling add a
          Count to her conquests?"

          The images blur forward again and stop. The scroll moves down
          page 3 of a newspaper to a small review. "Lisa Campbell, in a
          less than inspired performance, disappointed this reviewer once
          again..."

          Cut to a photo of Lisa on the arm of a distinguished looking
          man. The caption: "Lisa Campbell, here with London financier,
          Edward Forsythe, quits London Ballet. Replaced by rising young
          star."



          A lavish suite, but Lisa seems imprisoned by it's very luxury.
          Although dressed for a party in a flowing dress
          (Mrs. Fielding's party), she paces restlessly, stopping only to
          look out the window into the dark night that hovers over
          Central Park. Her face mirrors her deeply troubled thoughts.
          She doesn't hear the knock at the door at first, only as it
          grows insistant does she turn to the door.

                                        LISA

          The door opens and Collin comes in. He stands near the
          door. Lisa smiles. Her face instantly a mask of charm.

                                        LISA
                          Yes, Collin. What is it?

                          London tonight.

          Lisa laughs, dismissing it.

                                        LISA
                          Don't be silly. I have three more
                          performances this week.

                          They've been cancelled.

                          .... I suggest you take it up with
                          Mr. Forsythe when we get back to
                          London.

          Lisa tries to digest this.

                                  (with growing anxiety)
                          But Why? Why would he do this? He
                          knows how important this is to me.


          She stops, regarding Collin suspiciously.

                                        LISA
                          What did you say to him?

                          You overestimate me.

                          I just do what I'm told. I
                          suggest you do the same.

                                                                       (CONTINUED)  24CONTINUED:(2)15

        As she stares into the park below, she gathers herself, her
        mind racing. Then her demeanor changes... 180 degrees.
          Chamelion-like, she now wears an expression of soft
        acceptance as she turns back to face Collin.

                      I'm glad you feel that way.

        Lisa walks toward Collin with a gracious smile.

                      You will give me time to change
                      and pack.

        Collin is not taken in.

                                      COLLIN

                              (smiles)
                      I'll be waiting right outside.

        He leaves, closing the door behind him. After he goes, Lisa's
        facade fades and she stands, paralyzed with indecision. Then
        as a sense of defeat washes over her, she crosses to the
        dresser, opens a drawer and starts taking out some clothes. As
        she glances across the room she notices the door to the
        adjoining room. A moment's hope as she sees escape. She drops
        the clothes and goes to the door. She tries to open it, but
        it's locked from the other side. She turns from the door in
        frustration, her mind racing. Momentum building. She has to
        get away. The window. She runs to it and pulls it open. The
        breeze sweeps in, washing over her like freedom. She looks
        out.                                                                                        16.

              Father, Vincent, Mary, Samantha and a DOZEN TUNNEL DENIZENS
            are listening as Lisa charms with tales of her travels. Lisa
            does present an enticing picture with her beautiful dress and
              charming manner. Samantha is wide-eyed with wonder. Sitting
            close to Lisa, she soaks it all in, but Father is reserved,
              uneasy. Vincent sits somewhat apart from the others.

                            stage... I've never seen anything so
                            beautiful. Like dancing in a
                            cathedral.

                            be a ballerina?

            Lisa smiles wonderfully at Samantha's innocence.

                            I loved it here, Samantha. Without

                            danced. Father found me a teacher...

              A teenage Vincent leads a teenage Lisa down a long
              unfamiliar passage. She's full of excitement. He plays the
              chivalrous and proud suitor.

                      tell me. I hate surprises.

                      Be patient. You'll see.

      He leads her around a dank corner, her white dress whisping
        behind her.

                                                                  CUT TO:



      They arrive at a narrow passageway, where a gaping hole in
        the tunnel wall leads into utter blackness. Vincent regards
      Lisa for a beat before stepping through the hole into the
      base of a dark well. Lisa hesitates outside.

                                    YOUNG VINCENT
                      Don't be afraid.

      He reaches out to her.

                      Here, take my hand.

      Lisa grasps his hand and boldly steps:

        They stand together in this close black space, looking up
        above them.

        A row of iron rungs bolted into the sweating wall leads up
      into the gloom.

                      I'll go first. You follow.

      And he begins to climb. Lisa watches his dark shape ascend into
        the darkness. After a while, she can only hear him, the gentle
        clink clink of heel against iron. Then silence.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                          23.

          From way above comes a voice.

                                        YOUNG VINCENT
                        Your turn.

            Tentatively, Lisa reaches forthe third rung, and with a
          deep breath starts climbing.CAMERA MOVES WITH HER as she
          lifts herself rung by rung upthe curving wall.
            Three-quarters of the way up, she falters -- unableto
            continue.

                                        YOUNG LISA
                        I'm scared.

                                        YOUNG VINCENT
                        You're almost there. You can do
                        it. Don't look down.

          Lisa looks down at the bottom of the well, way below her. A
          vertigo swims in her head. Her grip loosens on the iron
          rung... and she's about to fall, when Vincent's strong hand
          thrusts into the frame, grabbing her arm, pulling her to
          safety.

            Together, they sit on the ledge at the top of the well,
            breathing hard at their close call.

                                        VINCENT
                        You're safe now.

                        Should we go back?

          Lisa peers over the edge back where they came from.

                                        YOUNG LISA
                        I don't think so...

                                                                    CUT TO:



          Closer to the surface, Vincent and Lisa walk with greater care,
          more quietly. Up above them, there's a faint RUMBLE. But it's
          not a subway. Vincent puts up his hand to stop Lisa. He turns
          towards her, and motions for her to be still.


            Together, they listen to the APPLAUSE from the theater above
          them. And then the first strands of the orchestra playing
          the overture to Swan Lake.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)                                                                                          24.

          Vincent leads Lisa into the chamber. He pulls two boxes up
          against the wall, and together he and Lisa stand on the boxes
          and peer through the grating. After a moment, Lisa turns to
          look at Vincent, her face transformed by joy. She mouths the
          words: "Thank you." Vincent regards her with love. She turns
          back to the grating to watch the ballet. Vincent continues to
          watch her for a beat, and then also turns his head toward the
          performance.

          Cathy is putting in a late night as the office. Hunched over
          her desk, a case file open before her. Joe comes out of his
          office, briefcase in hand, a coat draped over his arm. He
          pauses in front of Cathy.

                          That's what I like to see: the
                          taxpayer's money hard at work.

                          Don't get any ideas.

          Joe starts away, then turns back.

                          mentioned him.

                        tunnels as a girl. So dark. So
                        fast. And I always ran towards the
                        light, the blinding light...

          Without a word, Lisa turns and hurries off down the tunnel.

          direction.

        The velocity of their exchange has taken them to a new level
        of honesty... and the consequent pain is evident in Vincent's
        voice.

                                      VINCENT

                        Yes... for a time. But dreams
                        can't live in the imagination
                        forever. They become hopes...
                        possibilities.

          Vincent softens with understanding. Father regards him,
          remembering with sad, tender emotion.

ANGLE STAIRCASE as Vincent slowly descends the stone steps and
enters the dim, empty hall. He stands for a long, thoughtful
moment at the foot of the stairs. A soft, warm light begins to
appear on his face from some unseen source. Music eases in,
haunting, lyrical ("Apollo" of "Meyerling" perhaps) as Vincent
turns toward the light.

(FLASHBACK)



A single torch from a wall sconce sends flickering light
against the rocky walls. Young Vincent stands at the foot of
the stairs, watching Lisa as she dances... a vision of soft
sensuality in her gossamer dress, lost in the music, in
herself, in her fantasy. Then, Lisa sees him, their eyes
locking for just a moment... as she continues to dance.


Yet her movements seem to beckon Vincent closer... and he
cannot help but move toward her. Lisa dances near, resting her
hand on Vincent s shoulder as she balances in an arabesque, and
their eyes lock...

                          VINCENT
            You are so beautiful...

He raises his hand to touch her, but Lisa turns away,
moving behind him. Vincent turns, but she spins away from
him again... back into the center of the light, her lithe
silhouette casting graceful weaving shadows on the walls.


71 ANOTHER ANGLE71

Entranced, almost beyond himself, Vincent moves closer to
her... to the sensual image that entices... lures. She dances
around him, brushing past, laughing gently. He turns his head
as if to follow her sweet elusive scent.

Now Lisa turns and runs straight for Vincent, taking to the air
just as she is upon him -- trusting him completely as Vincent
lifts her high, her arms forming a graceful arch overhead. He
holds her aloft for a long moment... then easing her slowly
down as she lowers her arms around him. Their bodies are inches
apart, pressed close. Lisa's bare shoulders glisten.                                                                                        34.

        Their faces almost touching... as their lips brush... then
        brush again... then hold. The passions of youth rising...
        until Lisa suddenly pulls away and regards Vincent with
        a flicker of disgust: as if seeing his strange presence for
        the first time.

        strident, the angles sharper, the cuts quicker...

        holds on, as if trying desperately to regain the sweet
        promise of only a moment ago, his eyes imploring her to
        stay.

                      No...


  76ANOTHER ANGLE76

      as she twists away violently within Vincent's grip, his fingers
        slice through the sheer fabric of her dress, into the delicate
        flesh of her shoulders and back. From the force of her efforts,
        Lisa falls to the ground with a scream. She pulls herself
        across the floor, away from Vincent, before getting to her feet
        again. Then she notices: touches the blood as it soaks into her
        dress: looks up at Vincent, her face reflecting a deeper horror
      as she backs away, and turns to run...

                        I know you're remembering too,
                        despite the years. It's there... in
                      both our hearts.

        Lisa is reluctant to hear, but unable to leave.

                      For so long I couldn't forgive
                        myself for what I did... for
                        hurting you... driving you away.

                      What happened between us was no
                        one's fault. Don't you see? If I'd

                              (she breaks off,. then:)
                        Even when I was a little girl, I
                        knew that I would leave... someday.


                                      VINCENT
                        Because you couldn't find
                        happiness here...

                        I've been... happiness was somewhere
                        else.

          A silence follows her tragic confession.

        Lisa shrugs, trying to spread the thin veil of a smile over
        the pain on her face.

                                      LISA
                      I suppose it's my fate.

        After a moment:

                                      VINCENT
                      Perhaps we should try to forgive
                      one another.

                                    LISA
                      I'd like that. I really would.

        Lisa and Vincent are very close now. Closer than they have been
      in seventeen years. It's a moment where it seems anything can
        happen. Then:

                                      VINCENT
                      I know you are in danger, that
                      you're afraid... hiding.

        Lisa looks away.

                                      VINCENT

        Vincent fights his growing frustration.

                                      LISA
                      I don't need your help. I don't
                      need anyone's help. I'm fine.

        She starts toward the stairs, and Vincent takes a few steps
        after her, when he turns suddenly, and the CAMERA ZOOMS
        IN ON HIS FACE.

          machinery, and the thousands of unfinished chairs and tables
          waiting to be finished...

        Then the sound of a violent SLAP! as the CAMERA TURNS the
          corner, FINDING Cathy as she tries to catch her fall against
        the wall. John moves to prop her up again... but Cathy comes up
        hard with a backhand, which John dodges expertly -- but just
        barely -- catching her from behind and shoving her hard to the
          ground.

        John lifts Cathy up. She leans heavily against the wall,
          breathless and bruised, blood trickling from her nose and
        from the corner of her mouth.

                        human leg. Easier, really. John's
                      done it a thousand times. And you
                        wouldn't be the first woman.


        Cathy stares at Collin in defiant silence. Collin's lips twist
        into a thin, crooked smile. John brings back the crow bar...
        when a SHATTERING OF GLASS calls their attention upward.

          Vincent unleashes an unearthly roar as he gashes open the
        front of John's chest. John falls in a lifeless heap as
          Vincent turns to Collin, who grabs Cathy from behind, pinning
        her close with his gun in her neck. Vincent stops cold. It's a
        standoff. Collin backs away, staring at Vincent with abject
          fear... and Vincent continues toward him, staring him down. A
        tense standoff.                                                                                        41.

        Collin's gun hand starts to shake. He's losing his nerve. In
        a sudden panic, he straightens his arm, aims the gun

        ducks under the arm, twists the gun toward Collin just as it
        FIRES!

        The power of Vincent's emotion overwhelms Lisa. She tries to

                                      LISA
                        You're frightening me...

                                      VINCENT
                      You have only yourself to fear.
                            Your cowardice. You surround
                        yourself with illusion... but
                        illusions fade.

        Lisa still averts her face.Tears begin to well inside,
        but Vincent is unrelenting.

                                      VINCENT
                      When you can no longer dance to
                        enchant the world, what will you
                      do? Will you cling to whoever
                      will have you?! Is that all
                        you're worth?

        Lisa wipes at the tears she can no longer contain as she backs
        away, sitting on the bed. Vincent's rage is tempered by her
        anguish, his tone softens...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        43.

                                        VINCENT
                        Beyond the chaos of dreams lies
                        a world rich with possibilities...
                        but only if you first acknowledge
                        the pain you're feeling.
                                (then)
                        Because without that pain... we
                        can never truly know happiness.

          Lisa's tears are quieting as she listens, although she
          still cannot look at Vincent.

                                        VINCENT
                        There is much I would change if I
                        could, but... we must accept the
                        past and learn to grow beyond it.


          Lisa looks down in silence.A moment as Vincent moves
          slowly to her side.

                                        VINCENT
                                (softly)
                        Listen to your heart. It will tell
                        you what you need to know.

        He touches her shoulder gently. This time Lisa does not
          pull away, but turns slightly toward the softness of his
          touch. A beat as they both feel this moment of gentle
          healing.

                                        VINCENT
                                (a whisper)
                        I will always believe in you.

          Then Vincent leaves her. Lisa looks up and watches him
          go... her gaze lingering long after he is gone.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
