      Jay and Phil are alone in a giant field.  There may be other 
      people around, but they are far away.  Jay holds the remote 
      control and manipulates the plane, which flies above.  Phil 
      is into this.

                                  PHIL
                    Now can I try it?

                                  JAY
                    No.      MODERN FAMILY "Changes"    8/26/09 Shooting Draft              13.


                                  PHIL
                    I should get one of these.  I ve 
                    always loved planes.  If my life 
                    had gone a little differently, I 
                    think I would have been a pilot.
                          (then)
                    Hey, what would happen if you 
                    turned the remote off and then back 
                    on real fast?

                                  JAY
                    Yeah, you would have been a great 
                    pilot.

                                  PHIL
                    So can you do a loop-de-loop?*

                                  JAY
                    If I wanted to.*

                                  PHIL
                    No way.  Can I try it?*

                                  JAY
                    No.

                                  PHIL
                    Okay.

      A beat.

                                  PHIL (CONT D)
                    I can see why you like this, it s *
                    so peaceful.  I mean, the whole *
                    world disappears when you re out 
                    here.  *
                          (a long beat of silence)*
                      I remember this one summer --*

                                  JAY
                    Tell you what.  There s another 
                    trick called  threading the *
                    needle.   I used to do it with *
                    Claire and Mitch when they were 
                    kids.  You wanna try it?

                                  PHIL
                    How does it go?

                                  JAY
                    You grab one of those hoops over *
                    there and go stand way, way, way at *
                    the end of the field, and I fly the *
                    plane through it.*      MODERN FAMILY "Changes"    8/26/09 Shooting Draft              14.


      Phil considers this.

                                  PHIL
                    That sounds awesome!  And then I *
                    get a turn at flying it?

                                  JAY
                    No.

                                  PHIL
                    Okay.



      We see the silhouette of Phil far away, holding the hoop over *
      his head.  *

                                  PHIL
                          (yelling)
                    Is this far enough?

                                  JAY
                    That s good.  Now stand still!  
                    Don t move!

                                  PHIL
                    Okay!

      Jay manipulates the plane.  We see it high in the sky as it 
      swoops down toward Phil, who doesn t move.  The plane doesn t 
      hesitate -- it smacks into him and knocks him down violently.


                                  END OF ACT TWO      MODERN FAMILY "Changes"    8/26/09 Shooting Draft              18.


                                      ACT THREE



      CLOSE on Phil lying on the grass, moaning and disoriented.  

                                  PHIL
                    You hit me.

                                  JAY
                    You must have moved.  I told you to 
                    stay still.

                                  PHIL
                    I didn t move!

                                  JAY
                    Try not to talk.  I want to make 
                    sure nothing s broken.

      REVEAL that Jay is examining his plane.
