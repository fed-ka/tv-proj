Our POV rotates downwards onto an irregular shape.
This shape is grey-green and crammed with detail which
emerges as we draw close - like a continent seen from outer
space.
A fruit fly lands on it and we now recognise the shape as a
patch of lichen.
A number of other fruit flies are grazing there.
Wider. The lichen is on a rock. A
black lizard climbs over
the horizon - stalking flies.
A slow advance. A sudden rush. A fly is snapped up and
mashed between toothless gums.
The lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential
victim when...
A shadow falls, the lizard tries to flee. A seabird grabs
the lizard in its claws. Death is sudden and bloody.
The bird settles to eat.
Whizz...Thunk. A sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and
impales the bird through its wing.
The wounded bird falls between boulders, flapping
helplessly.
The rest of the flock take to their air, calling and
wheeling as...
A crowd of local savages come racing over the larger
horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows,
spears, rocks and throwing-sticks...
A child grabs the injured bird and kills it.
An adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird.
The rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting
each other, shouting and snarling among the whirling flock
of birds.
AND WE CUT TO

A POV shot through a telescope: The whirling birds the
strange half-animal forms of the savages.
The whole scene is jerky, out of focus and inaudible at
this great distance like a very old silent movie.
CHARLES DARWIN (V.O.)
In Terra del Fuego. The "land of
fire" - A blighted and loveless
country on the earths furthest
rim - there lives a community of
the dirtiest, the rudest, the
least civilised beings you can
imagine.
The telescope focusses. The image becomes a little clearer
4
4
The flock of boobies fly out to sea.
The savages follow as far as the top of the cliffs, where
they stop in sudden amazement, staring at a distant sailing
ship.
DARWIN (V.O.)
They were all completely naked,
the men as well as the women,
with hair down to their bottoms.
They spoke in grunts and they
never washed their hands and
faces! In many respects they
resembled wild animals, except
that animals are kinder to their
children.
A savage child makes a comment and gets biffed on the head
again.
Strange, foreign cries of the sailors are faintly audible
over the water, as the anchor is dropped with a rattle and
a splash. A small boat is lowered.
DARWIN
One day, Captain Fitzroy went
ashore to meet them.
The slow rhythm of the oars.
Sailors and savages clutch their weapons, watching each
other in breathless anticipation.
3

6
Waves lap on the black pebbly beach, where a young naval
captain FITZROY with mutton chop sideboards disembarks
lightly from his jolly-boat.
4
DARWIN (V.O.)
After some discussion persuaded
three of the savages` children to
come home with him.
The "discussion" is more in the nature of heated bargaining
for slaves.
Fitzroy finally produces enough cloth and axe-heads to
secure the deal.
The unwilling children pushed away by their parents and
grabbed by sailors who bundle them, biting crying and
kicking, into the waiting boat.
DARWIN (V.O.)
Their names were Jemmy Buttons,
York Minster and Fuegia Basket.
7
9
Splosh! A weighted canvas body bag is tipped overboard.
The rough unshaven seamen crew all remove their hats, some
of them cry openly.
5
DARWIN
York Minster died of the smallpox
but the other two learned English
and went to meet the queen.
10
10
A fanfare as the gates swing open as a coach-and-four
rattles through.
11
12
Hairy savages reassemble on the cliff tops
DARWIN
Two years later. Captain Fitzroy
and I took them back, in the
company of a young Parson, hoping
they would bring the other
savages to god and to teach the
others by example.
The hairy savages squint from the cliffs to sea....
Another boat, the Beagle, has anchored in their bay.
Captain Fitzroy is being rowed ashore with Darwin, plus a
very young parson and the two young Fuegans, who are happy
and agitated to see their homeland again.
DARWIN
And what do you think happened?
13
14
At the first sight of their countrymen, Jemmy and Fuegia
rip off their clothes, drop the bible and the telescope,
and run to join them, yelling like nut-cases.
HAIRY SAVAGES
YAAAAAH!!
JEMMY/ FUEGIA
Yaah!! Yahh!!
The benighted young parson scrambles after them, collecting
their discarded garments from among the rain-swept rocks.
PARSON
Jemmy! Fuegia
The telescope is smashed. The Bible lies abandoned - the
wind catching its soggy pages and whirling them off in the
storm.
15
17
A branch taps gently against the window pain, like an
insistent guest demanding to be admitted.
The coal fire burns low in the grate - wind in the chimney
rattling the damper
Firelight flickers on a collection of finches in a glass
case, on a bird skeleton, on a fossil, and on numerous
specimen bottles containing the fleshy parts of barnacles
preserved in spirit-of-wine.
Darwin sits immobile in his chair, regarding a locked,
black lacquered steel trunk, on the floor under his work
table.
A voice speaks behind him.
ANNIE
Aren't you going to open it?
He turns and sees her sitting on the day bed - the same
little bright eyed girl from the daguerrotype studio.
She's the same age as she was then and wearing the same
checkered dress - though Darwin himself has aged ten years.
10
DARWIN
Maybe best if I just burn the
whole lot.
ANNIE
(horrified)
No papa - You can't. I'm in it.
DARWIN
Don't be absurd. Of course you're
not.
ANNIE
The story of me when I was small.
You showed me the pages.
DARWIN
Ah yes.
ANNIE
"The natural History of babies"
...Remember?
DARWIN
Of course I remember.
He continues to stare at the shiny black box, his hand
fluttering lightly - a nervous tic.
Music seeps in - a soothing Chopin Nocturne and....
18
19
An army of children - the Darwin family - run across the
screen from left to right. The little kids first,
scampering through the hay meadow off into the trees.
Household servants follow, carrying blankets, hampers and
parasols.
The red haired Scottish nursemaid Brodie, shouts ahead to
the little ones.
12
BRODIE
Careful! Not too far ahead now.
The children ignore her so she pick up her skirts and races
after them.
The Adults follow in their wake - Charles and Emma Darwin
plus two younger men aged about 30 - Joe Hooker and the Rev
Innes
20
20
They have set up their picnic on a river bank.
Emma is reading.
Joseph Hooker is teaching the boys to fish. He has
spectacles and long wispy side-whiskers: a battered panama
on his head and his trousers rolled up to his knees.
HOOKER
Give it time to take a bite.
The fishing float moves a little
HOOKER
He's Nibbling. Nibbling. Oh
Bother. No-one move.
He's dropped his spectacles in the shallows.
George (aged 5) feels a jerk on the line. He squeals and
drops the rod. The fish takes off upriver. Will goes after
the dropped rod.
On shore, Annie runs up with a collecting box to show her
father
ANNIE
I've got one.
She opens the box to show him a little black beetle.
The local parson, Innes, inclines his head to inspect it
ANNIE
What should I feed it?
MR INNES
A leaf I should think. What plant
did you find him on?
ANNIE
In the mud under that log.
Innes looks to Darwin for advice
13
MR INNES
...Or a piece of bark maybe.
Darwin peers at the insect
DARWIN
Cycrus caraboides. You can see
from the mandibles he's a hunter.
He feeds on slugs and snails.
INNES
Oh.
Annie runs off, calling to the other children
ANNIE
Etty! Willy! Find me some slugs.
He's hungry!
INNES
When I said I knew something of
insects.....
DARWIN
Oh tush.... I studied Theology
for a year but yet I know
exceedingly little of the bible.
INNES
Then once I am properly installed
at Down I shall take pleasure in
instructing you.
DARWIN
I should look forward to that
immensely.
Emma, knowing her husband's ambivalence towards religion,
casts him a slightly arch, amused look. Innes notices this,
though he pretends not to.
Hooker returns from the river, looking slightly damp, with
the rod which he has managed to retrieve
HOOKER
Everyone's a bit wet. Sorry, but
the fish are surely biting. More
worms, boys, more worms.
George is looking under stones
HOOKER
Try over there, Georgey, we've
used all these ones up.
They move off, joining Annie and the other in their hunt
for crawling things. The air above them is heavy and
sparkling with pollen.
14
21
21
A sailing ship sails past, trailing phosphorescence it its
wake.
DARWIN (V.O.)
On the Beagle, quite, often we
would drop a flask in the ocean
and find it teeming with living
particles which glowed in the
night
22
23
Cut to the air above the picnickers - alive with glittering
particles - against the dark trees behind.
DARWIN
....so much beauty for so little
purpose.
EMMA
Surely not without purpose. They
were helping to light the ship's
way were they not.
Darwin smiles at the idea, turns to Innes
DARWIN
Are you familiar with the works
of Thomas Malthus, Mr Innes?.
INNES
He married his first cousin
didn't he?
EMMA
So did Charles.... So did I.
INNES
Oh, I was not at all
suggesting....
Emma waves it away. Just teasing
15
DARWIN
He made the point that if every
trout, say, has a hundred
offspring And so on and so on
through the generations. Then the
planet would be knee deep in
trout in just a few decades.
INNES
Of course most of the eggs are
destroyed and eaten so the
numbers remain stable. That is
the beauty of God's plan.
Emma gives Darwin a "So there" look and hands Innes a
sandwich.
EMMA
Cheese and cucumber
INNES
Thank-you
Somewhere in the woods, Annie has found a treasure trove of
worms and slugs.
ANNIE (O.S. DISTANT)
Over here ....there are millions!
DARWIN
It doesn't strike you as an
exceedingly wasteful plan - these
myriad lives created only to be
immediately extinguished.
EMMA
(a gentle warning)
Charles....
INNES
(confidently)
They are providing food for
others.
DARWIN
You think they are happy about
it?
INNES
Happy?
Close up on a writing worm. Hooker is instructing George
how to put a worm on a hook.
HOOKER
Through his bottom and up though
his mouth - perfect
16
DARWIN
....To be doing Gods will.
EMMA
(to Innes)
Please ignore him. After two
glasses of claret he tends to
becomes mischievous.
DARWIN
No I'm serious. If thousands are
destroyed that a few may live
their lives, is not the general
sum total of happiness not in
some kind of massive deficit?
INNES
Well far be it from me to
speculate on the mind of God, far
less the happiness of an
earthworm ha ha ha. But it seems
to me that nature is at
peace...and most of her denizens
are content.
EMMA
Amen.
INNES
(to Darwin)
You don't agree.
DARWIN
I think it is a battlefield. A
constant and shifting struggle
for survival between everything
and everything else.
EMMA
I really do think men have a
problem with natural beauty. They
cannot ever just accept it for
what it is.
(Calls off)
Children! Sandwiches!
(Then)
Tell me of your wife Mr Innes.
Darwin lies back on the rug and turns his head away from
the sun.
The base of a tangled hedgerow is just a few feet away.
Looking into its tangled depths he sees something gleaming
white - the skull of a sheep with briars growing through
the eye sockets.
17
24
24
The sheep's skull is half-decomposed.
In fast forward we see maggots pecking the remnants of
flesh from the bone, birds feeding on the maggots.
A bird becomes trapped among the briars. It flaps madly
upsetting a nest.
Eggs and blind featherless hatchlings fall down through the
dark web of branches where they are devoured by voles and
rats, then slugs, then worms
All the times tendrils and vines are growing, the skull -
bleached white - now encased in a cage of thick spiny
branches, fizzing with insect life, where ants and ground
beetles feast on the carcasses of slugs and....
25
31
Pealing of church bells
Mist rises from the ploughed fields and hangs among the
ancient oaks.
A little procession heads down the lane. The Darwins -
Charles and Emma - plus their servants and children (older
now, for we have flipped into the present), all in their
Sunday best.
The trees are bare. Their breath condenses as they walk.
32
32
The ancient flint church stands in the centre of Downe
(sic) village, opposite the George and Dragon pub.
20
A massive and venerable Yew tree casts its shade over a
number of gravestones one of them inscribed "to Mary Darwin
born Sept 1842 died Oct 1842."
Beyond the church fence, villagers greet each other before
heading inside. The great majority of the village have
turned out, from Squire Lubbock through the tradesmen and
domestic servants from the village to the clodhoppers (farm
labourers) in their colored smocks.
Rev Innes is welcoming his large flock at the gate.
EMMA
Reverend Innes.
INNES
(smiling)
Ma'am. Welcome. Welcome
Then his eye moves on to Charles Darwin and his smile
falters, his expression turning slightly cold.
Darwin tips his hat rather stiffly and walks away, through
the throng of parishioners, leaving his family to file into
the church without him.
33
33
Darwin walks across the meadow and into the woods.
A flock of crows take flight from the rookery in the bare
trees overhead.
34
35
The dovecote is a substantial affair on four pillars with a
ladder in the centre.
Outside the dovecote, the boys are racing around playing at
soldiers. (Franky 10, Lenny 8, Horace 6)
21
Parslow has a number of the birds in cages
DARWIN
Ring the two milky pouters. We'll
sacrifice the tumblers and
skeletonize them. Then...
He looks up as a coach appears in the lane. The boys
immediately break off from their game and run after it,
shouting.
BOYS
It's Mr Hooker. It's Mr Hooker!
Darwin tries to wipe the bird shit off his hands and
succeeds only in getting it on his sleeve.
His breathing quickens. He seems at a loss. Parslow is
awaiting further instructions
PARSOLOW
Then... what Sir?
DARWIN
Just. ...to the shed with them. I
shall clean myself up.
He hurries off.
36
36
The coach pulls up and Hooker alights - ten years older
than when we saw him catching fish, but still with the same
hallmark side whiskers and wire-rimmed spectacles, the same
springy step and ready grin.
Already he is being mobbed by the younger boys - Lenny,
Franky, and Horace - who clearly adore him.
BOYS(AD LIB)
- We're the Light Brigade Horace
is a Russian.
HOOKER
Good choice Horace. I shall be
Lord Raglan and watch the
slaughter from a safe distance.
BOYS
- Will you give us a piggy-back?
- Lenny cut his foot on a nail.
There was lots of blood!
Emma emerges from the front door. She smiles, pleased to
see Hooker despite her misgivings.
22
Then her smile falters as another man emerges from the
coach behind him.
HOOKER
Emma. Forgive the short notice.
You know Thomas Huxley.
EMMA
Only by reputation
HUXLEY
Mrs Darwin.
HOOKER
He insisted on coming and I could
not refuse him.
EMMA
Tell papa his visitors are here.
LENNY
He knows already.
HORACE
He went that way.
Emma smiles brightly, covering for her embarrassment at her
husband's increasingly erratic behavior.
EMMA
Anyway. Come in please. Come in.
Hooker heads towards the house, the boy still clustered
around him.
FRANKY
Sir, Is it true when you were in
the Himalayas you were imprisoned
by the king of Sikkim?
HOOKER
Absolutely true.
LENNY
And he thought you were a spy for
stealing his rhododendrons?
HOOKER
That's approximately true.
FRANKY
....and he wouldn't let you leave
unless you agreed to marry his
fattest daughter.
23
HOOKER
Yes. (Conspiratorial) ....but
you are never to tell my wife
that!
EMMA
Children leave Mr Hooker alone
now. I'm sure he has more
important things to discuss.
HOOKER
Not really, but I think Mr Huxley
does....
Huxley has seen Darwin, washing his hands by the
"skeletonizing shed".
Huxley hangs back to introduce himself as Hooker steers
Emma off into the house.
HOOKER
I have my heart set on a cup of
tea and one of Mrs Davies'
scones.
Emma looks anxiously after Huxley but allows herself to be
gently side-lined.
37
38
The Sand-walk is a gravel walking path between the garden
and the fields, flanked by mature oaks and ancient willows.
HUXLEY
We're reforming the Linnean. The
committee will comprise myself,
Lyell, Huxley...yourself of
course if you are willing.
24
Darwin grunts noncommittally. The Crunch crunch of their
feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal-shod
walking stick.
HUXLEY
We intend to reclaim science as a
profession - wrest it away from
the country parsons and beetle-
collectors. Your book will be our
rallying point.
DARWIN.
You know it is not yet any fit
state to publish.
HUXLEY
I have read your detailed
abstract. The argument is
complete and utterly compelling.
All that is lacking is the detail
and we know you have that in
abundance. Your barnacle work has
established you as the pre-
eminent authority on marine life.
DARWIN.
On one small mollusc!
HOOKER
In which the whole story of
creation can be read. Do not
pretend to me that was not your
intention.
DARWIN.
Honestly....
HUXLEY
A "family tree" of barnacles
stretching back 300 million years
to the time it was a free
swimming prawn!.
DARWIN.
There are many gaps.
HOOKER
Of course with gaps! But that is
the very point. If we but had the
complete fossil record we could
trace all life back to one speck
of protoplasm. The branching of
forms in ever more complex
succession...until.
DARWIN.
Yes yes, but one cannot infer too
much.
25
HOOKER
Mr Darwin. Either you are being
disingenuous or you do not fully
understand you own
accomplishment. You have killed
God.
DARWIN.
Mr Huxley
HUXLEY
....and good riddance to the
bearded malicious old bugger!
DARWIN
(interrupts)
Please I must beg of you....
HUXLEY
No. I must beg of you sir. Joseph
Hooker we know is too nice a chap
to do it. You are a fine and
brilliant man who hates to give
offence - an admirable quality -
wish I had it myself. But what do
we believe? What do we know to be
true. Will you light the way or
leave us all to flounder in the
mire for another decade.
He stops and lowers himself onto a bench, teeth clenched.
HOOKER
Are you alright?
DARWIN.
A touch of indigestion. It will
pass.
Its clearly worse than that, but Huxley, refusing to be
distracted, blithely ignores it and sits down beside him
til the worst of it passes.
HUXLEY
It is time to write your book Mr
Darwin. Write it brilliantly as
we all know you can. Strike hard
and fast with a blow that is
utterly conclusive.
DARWIN
(in pain)
Sir, you are talking like a
revolutionary and really...
HUXLEY
It is a revolution. And not
before time.
(MORE)
26
HUXLEY (cont'd)
Goodbye to the lot of em - damned
bishops and Archbishops with
their threats of eternal
punishment.
DARWIN
And you'd replace Gods Laws with
what.
HUXLEY
The laws of logic. The laws of
nature.
DARWIN
Knowing, as we do, that most
capital crimes are her everyday
practises: Theft, rape, murder,
adultery, infanticide....
Huxley waves it away
DARWIN
We live in a society bound
together by the church. An
improbable sort of barque I grant
you but at least it floats. You
suggest we change all that at a
stroke. You wish me to rebuild,
plank by plank, the very vessel
we are sailing in.
39
39
The Coach to London has pulled up outside the front gate.
Huxley is aboard. Darwin is talking with the coachman
Hooker comes down the path in his black coat, carrying his
Gladstone bag.
EMMA
Mr Hooker.
He turns. He has already said his good-byes.
EMMA
I beg you, please don't push him.
HOOKER
No-one can push Charles. You know
how fixed he is. Bit of a
barnacle himself ... his own
words.
EMMA
And if you prize him from his
rock he will die. I know you all
mean well but....
27
COACHMAN
(Impatiently)
All aboard!
Hooker gets aboard. Huxley leans out of a window and waves
cheerily to the whey-faced Darwin
HUXLEY
We'll meet again, Mr Darwin
40
42
Sitting with Annie ten years ago on an English pebble
beach.
She has collected a pile of shells and is arranging them in
"families".
The dialogue is continuous
DARWIN
Why do you always ask for Jenny?
Its so sad.
ANNIE
That's why I like it. It makes me
cry.
29
She looks up from her shells and smiles winningly.
Darwin looks out to sea, at the bright crashing line of
surf, and begins the familiar, much-told tale:
DARWIN
Once apon a time there was a
family of Orang-u-tangs living in
the jungles of darkest Borneo
43
43
Our POV moves between dark tropical trees to find a group
of Orangutans flopping around grooming each other.
As with the land of the Fuegan savages, there is something
slightly artificial about these jungles, as though the
trees really belong in Kew gardens, and the naked jungle
warriors, whom we now see stalking through them, are on
loan from the museum of mankind.
DARWIN
Their eldest daughter was the
most loving, caring and trusting
Orang of all.
We follow a young nimble female, swinging through the
trees, revelling in her own gymnastic ability, until she
stops - hearing something: the sound of human speech.
DARWIN
But these qualities in themselves
cannot guarantee an ape's
survival. Sometimes, quite the
reverse.
Native hunters are creeping through the undergrowth
A warning screech from one of the Orang-u-tangs posted as
lookouts.
Most of the apes flee up into the canopy. Jenny stays where
she is, fascinated, just a moment longer than is prudent.
DARWIN
When she realized her danger it
was too late.
As she turns to flee a weighted net is thrown on top of
her. The hunters pounce.
DARWIN
They put her in a bag and carried
her off....
30
ANNIE
" much to her loving parent's
sorrow."
DARWIN
Exactly.
The family screech and hoot, anguished, as the hunters head
back off through the trees.
44
44
Exotic coins and bank-notes pass from hand to hand: from
the tribal chief to the sultan, in his overlarge turban,
from the sultan to the trader in his solar topee and
stained white suit.
DARWIN
The hunters sold her the to the
Sultan who promptly sold her to a
visiting Englishman who packed
her aboard a sailing ship and
brought her to London zoo.
Jenny is taken out of a bamboo cage and put into a metal
cage.
45
47
The salt wind. The dazzling light. The slow pulse of the
surf.
Darwin has paused in his narrative.
ANNIE
Go on papa.
DARWIN
Go on what.
ANNIE
The bit where she gets sick and
dies.
DARWIN
No. Why do you want to hear that
bit?
ANNIE
I just like it. It makes me cry.
Darwin smiles, his own eyes filling with tears.
Then a door opens, softly, in the sky.
48
51
EMMA stands alone in the wintry garden, a white apron over
her black dress, reading.
DARWIN (V.O)
What else can I say to you,
except that it seems the process
is now complete.
A tear tracks down the curve of Emma's cheek as she folds
the letter, puts it in her pocket and return to the
business of dead-heading flowers.
In voice over we hear singing.
35
CONGREGATION
All
things bright and beautiful,
all
creatures great and small.
All
things wize and wonderful,
The
lord God made them all.
52
52
Move in through the graveyard, past the ancient yew..
CONGREGATION (OS)
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings.
53
54
The rise and fall of Innes's voice continues in the
background as Darwin walks out from the porch, emerging
from shadow into sunlight.
37
A summers day. He feels like a weight has been lifted.
The church beadle comes out behind him.
BEADLE
Are you all right, sir?
DARWIN
Never better. Thank-you.
He heads off up the gravel path
55
INT WOODLANDS. THE PRESENT. DAY
55
The faint and Distant sound of church singing filters
through the misty woods. The black wet trunks of trees
catch the sunlight.
Frosty dew highlights Mistletoe and holly and dead bracken
and the sudden red flash of a robin.
Darwin cuts a strange dark angular figure, walking along
the narrow track a single step at a time.
He pauses breathing, and listens.
His quick eye catches the robin seizing a worm.
Further on. A pheasant breaks cover. A hare stands upright
in a clearing then bounds away.
Darwin looks down and takes another step, placing his feet
carefully, silently so as not to disturb the wildlife.
Cut to a different pair of much newer shoes in exactly the
same spot.
56
58
Emma lies on a rug, her head is in Darwin's lap. She is
reading aloud from a new book of poems by Wordsworth.
EMMA
"Loving she is, and tractable
though wild.
And innocence hath privilege in
her.
To dignify arch looks and
laughing eyes;
And feats of cunning; and the
pretty round
Of trespasses, affected to
provoke Mock chastisement, and
partnership in play"
She puts the book down
DARWIN
(smiling)
Then we were wrong. She is not
unique after all.
Darwin is watching Annie dancing in front of the surf ,
turning cartwheels - a wild dancing sprite of the sea,
oblivious to the cold, shouting and singing:
59
THE BEACH. LATER
59
Later, Near the cliff, Darwin is "geologising"
He's excited, breathless and windswept, shouting over the
sound of the nearby surf as he clambers over the huge
assorted boulders pointing out the geological strata to his
kids who are more interested in clambering.
41
DARWIN
This is Devonian, about 400
million years ago. Rocks like
this might have fishes in them,
trilobites, tree ferns, corals
maybe....
He knock off a corner of rock with his geological hammer,
then moves on
ETTY
Is this a bit?
DARWIN
No that is Cretaceous Etty. It
was made a hundred millions years
ago, when this cliff was a coral
reef and Down village was a swamp
full of great crocodiles.
Tap tap tap with his hammer as the boys scramble upwards,
playing at mountaineers.
DARWIN
We might find oysters and sponges
imprinted in it, or dinosaurs if
we were lucky...
GEORGE
What's a dinosaur?
ETTY
Professor Owen invented them.
DARWIN
They are the giant lizards which
lived on earth before there were
any humans.
BETTY
But they weren't real
DARWIN
Of course they are, Betty. Did I
never tell you of the skeletons I
found in South America
(to Etty)
Do you remember Mr Martell?
ETTY
No.
Annie arrives, hopping nimbly over the rocks still in her
wet swimsuit
42
ANNIE
Yes you do. When he came to tea
and showed us drawings of his
Iguanodon. And George burnt his
fingers roasting chestnuts.
ETTY
Oh yes.
ANNIE
She doesn't remember.
DARWIN
You should have your clothes on
Annie. You are quite blue.
ANNIE
Savages don't swear clothes.
She runs to the top of a great fallen rock, spreads her
arms out, and yells to the sky.
ANNIE
I'm a Fuegan.
DARWIN
Well don't fall and hurt
yourself. Your mother would never
forgive me.
Annie gives a shout and disappears head over heels.
DARWIN
Annie!
ANNIE
I've found one!
In the rubble at the base of the rocks she has landed,
unhurt and quite by accident on a perfect specimen of a
fossilized trilobite.
60
68
Emma, passing the open door glimpses Darwin talking angrily
to himself as he writes.
DARWIN
....and then she can read it, and
we can all be free of this! Now,
please, Annie no more
interruptions!
69
69
The music continues, louder.
A frosty coating of dew covers the lawn.
Footprints lead to a strange wooden tower in the garden.
Parslow stands outside, shivering in the grey morning
light.
Darwin shouts from inside.
DARWIN
Pull!
Parslow pulls a lever.
There's the sound of crashing water, a yell of pain from
inside the tower.
Ravens rise, calling, from the surrounding trees.
70
88
Parslow picks up two of them, casually wrings their necks
and heads off with them to the skeletonizing shed.
89
THE PAST. DAY
91
Annie dancing in the surf. One minute she is there and the
next she has vanished, lost among the churning waves.
Darwin leaps top his feet shouting
DARWIN
Annie!
Raucous male laughter takes us to
92
96
Darwin heads across the lawn, takes a key from his belt and
opens the door of the skeletonizing shed.
97
99
Displaced doves beat the air.
Darwin climbs down the ladder, grabs and axe and attacks
the wooden stanchions supporting the dovecote
Parslow comes running over from the skeletonizing shed,
calling:
PARSLOW
Sir. Mr Darwin.
Darwin stands back, hair wild, eyes crazed, his sleeves
covered in bird shit.
PARSLOW
Please rest sir. I'll have John
Lewis remove it. Have some
breakfast now and rest. Shall I
call the doctor?
DARWIN
God know.
PARSLOW
Or the water tower.
DARWIN
A pox on all of them!
100
102
Darwin sits in sunshine at the rear of the house, rugged up
against the cold. Looking frail still, but oddly at peace.
INNES
Ah, there you are Mr Darwin.
Darwin looks up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky,
dark-suited figure of Mr Innes.
60
INNES
May I join you.
DARWIN
By odd means
He makes some space on the bench. Innes hesitates, unable
to read Darwin's feelings towards him. The smile is
welcoming enough but there is something not altogether
balanced about it
INNES
Mrs Darwin informed me you would
be alone and ....perhaps a need
to counsel.
He sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve
it.
INNES
You dropped this. What a
beautiful postage stamp.
DARWIN
Yes. It is from the Spice
islands.
INNES
I do rather envy your wide circle
of correspondents. In my youth I
always wanted to travel.
DARWIN
You are still young. You could be
a missionary and follow in Mr
Livingstone's footsteps.
INNES
Yes, although I have always felt
there is quite enough evil at
home without looking for it
abroad.
(Then, casually)
Mrs Darwin told me of the book
you are writing.
DARWIN
Not any more, thank goodness
INNES
You have finished it?
DARWIN
It has been finished for me. My
correspondent In the spice
islands has arrived independently
at exactly the same idea,
expressed in a mere twenty pages.
(MORE)
61
DARWIN (cont'd)
There's brevity for you. I had so
far covered two hundred an fifty
and come to a dead end. So
finally I am rid of the project.
Innes is relieved to hear it
INNES
The Lord moves in mysterious
ways.
DARWIN
He does indeed Mr Innes. I was
reflecting only the other day on
the fact that he has endowed us
in his blessed generosity with
not one but nine hundred species
of intestinal worm each with its
own unique method of infiltrating
the blood supply and burrowing
through the mucosa.
Innes shifts uncomfortably.
DARWIN
And then again on the great love
he shows for butterflies by
inventing a wasp to lay eggs
inside the living flesh of
caterpillars
INNES
Well. It is not for us to guess
at His reasons.
DARWIN
No. We can leave that for Mr
Wallace now. Should I advise him
to stay overseas do you think? If
he shows his face in Kent he may
be required to kneel on rock
salt.
Innes rises. He's a short man, acutely aware of any threats
to his dignity, and he's had enough of this mockery
INNES
I once valued our friendship Mr
Darwin. I had hoped it might be
possible to restore it. Clearly
in your present mood that is not
going to be possible. My regards
to Mrs Darwin
He starts off round the corner of the house.
62
Darwin listens to his footsteps receding, then turns his
face back to the sun. When he opens his eyes sees a figure
standing in the lawn.
It is Annie, plain as day, scowling at him angrily.
DARWIN
What? I am forestalled by Mr
Wallace. That is the simple fact
of it. What reason do you have to
be angry?!
She shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him
and runs off towards the meadow.
Darwin, instantly remorseful, gets to his feet and hurries
after her.
DARWIN
Annie!
He reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden
intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and
fells him to his knees.
He lies their gasping, his vision clouding as the pages of
the Wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to
the wind.
A view from high above: spiralling downwards on the Darwin
garden, as household servants emerge from various quarters
and hurry to his assistance.
103
105
Down the patch and through the open gate with the servants
following.
DARWIN
Get aboard. Brodie
ANNIE
(shouts back)
Mama!
The garden gate clangs shut behind them.
106
109
A steam train comes charging past trailing plumes of black
smoke, striking sparks from the track with its wheels.
110
111
The train wheezes to a halt. The doors open and the train
disgorges its cargo of sick people, come to Malvern for
treatment - a coughing child, a woman with one side of her
face aflame with shingles - the halt the lame and the
afflicted.
68
112
112
Darwin sits in the back as the attendant drives them
through Malvern.
DARWIN
Tell him not this way.
PARSLOW
(loudly)
Hello there. Stop. Can we go by
the other route
ATTENDANT
The Worcester Road is shorter.
DARWIN
...by the low road.
PARSLOW
He wishes to go by the other
route.
ATTENDANT
(with a sigh)
As you will sir.
He backs up the horses and turns the cart around
113
118
A bright sunny day. Darwin, looking weak but purged, sits
on the terrace, sipping a glass of foul-tasting mineral
water and looking out over the stone houses, fields and
valleys of Malvern.
Gully sits with him, interviewing him.
GULLY
What action do you most associate
with the symptoms. Eating? Strong
emotion? Strenuous Excercise?
DARWIN
Does the exercise of memory count
as an action.
GULLY
Memory of what.
DARWIN
My eldest daughter. You remember
her.
GULLY
Of course. Of course. You must
accept there was nothing more we
could do.
DARWIN
I know that. I know.
A long, awkward silence, neither of them wants to
recapitulate the events of Annies death.
GULLY
You say you were writing about
her.
DARWIN
No. It is a scientific text. But
I had reached a point, beyond
which it was impossible to
progress. She had been my
companion throughout. Now it
seemed she was ahead of me in a
place I could not follow.
72
GULLY
Of course. Plainly she is in
heaven.
DARWIN
That is what my wife believes. It
is a great consolation to her
GULLY
But not to you.
DARWIN
Emma and I have become ...divided
on it.
GULLY
Does it affect your marital
relations.
DARWIN
We have none ...to speak of.
GULLY
(a beat)
Are you familiar with the
writings of DeQuincy."There is no
such thing known to the mind as
forgetting."
DARWIN
I don't know what it means.
GULLY
He suggests we have thoughts
which do not actually enter the
realm of consciousness. Nervous
fibres exist after all throughout
the whole body. Is it not
possible that certain primal
feelings manifest in some
physical way. Eczema. Boils. A
fever. Might some blocked passion
imitate a gall-stone? Or even
manufacture one.
DARWIN
Well, until someone devises a
machine to read nervous impulses,
or a telescope to look inside
the body I suppose we can only
guess at it.
GULLY
We can Mr Darwin. We can look
inside you. If you find yourself
open to it, there is a way of
seeing.
73
119
119
Darwin wanders the cobbled streets of Malvern, pausing
occasionally to consult a hand-written address.
It is starting to rain as, finally, he arrives at the
address he is looking for. A substantial terraced house.
Darwin descends a stone staircase to the imposing front
door, and rings the bell.
As he waits for an answer a woman appears, unseen in the
rain streaked window above, observing him.
Darwin rings again. A moment later the woman answers the
door.
DARWIN
Mrs St John?
MRS ST JOHN
Mr Darwin. Come in.
120
122
Darwin steps outside and she slams the door on him. Darwin
continues to rant at the closed door, standing in the
pouring rain without his umbrella.
He gets to the top of the steps, and looks around, trying
to get his bearings.
In a pool of lamp-light at the far end of the street a
figure stands watching him.
Darwin squints at her through the rain, which is falling
harder now.
The figure is Annie.
She looks at him crossly, then heads off up a cobbled side-
street.
Darwin follows.
123
123
Darwin pursues his daughter up narrow cobbled lanes.
DARWIN
Annie. Annie!
76
The rain is getting heavier, turning the gutters into
rivers.
Water overflows the drains and culverts and rushes over the
cobbles, making them slick and treacherous.
Darwin hurries down darkened lanes and alleys, the sound of
rushing water echoing all around, the little girl always
ahead of him.
A DRUNK MAN in oilskins comes barreling past him, head
down, cursing the weather.
A child's ball goes floating downhill in the current.
Darwin loses Annie, then he sees her again, at the top of a
steep flight of stone steps.
Darwin, drenched chases after her.
124
124
At the top of the steps he stops for breath and he looks
around.
There is no sign of Annie but he knows this street - The
Worcester Road - a row of Grey Georgian houses, their backs
against the hill, their sloping front gardens looking out
over the rooftops of Malvern.
Most of the street is in darkness but the house directly
opposite has lights in the window.
He knows this house also.
He hesitates, then crosses the street towards it.
125
125
Soaked to the skin, he raps with the brass door-knocker,
then waits for someone to answer.
Muffled voices. Then a man answers from within.
LANDLORD (O.S.)
Hello?
DARWIN
Is Mrs Carey still the landlady
here.
LANDLORD
No.
The door opens on a chain.
77
DARWIN
My daughter Annie ...lodged here
some years ago. Can I come in?
The man closes the door to release the chain, then opens it
again to admit Darwin.
DARWIN
I know this is an intrusion. I
wonder - could I visit the room
she stayed in?
The landlord doesn't know what to make of this
LANDLORD
Wait here. I'll get the missus.
He leaves Darwin dripping in the hallway which he goes and
consults with his wife in the lighted parlour.
Darwin looks around. This place is all too familiar to him -
the bevelled gold-rimmed mirror, the carved mock-Tudor coat-
stand.
Muffled conversation off.
There are crutches and walking sticks among the umbrellas.
Lavender potpourri in a brass dish. A wheel-chair in one
corner, a picture of the pieta above the door.
Finally, the land-lady emerges from
her parlour.
LANDLADY
Which room?
DARWIN
Fourteen. I would only be there
ten minutes. I am happy to pay.
She goes into an alcove and emerges with a key.
LANDLADY
Up one flight and along the
corridor to the right.
DARWIN
I remember.
LANDLADY
Try not to touch anything.
126
134
Darwin enters through the heavy stone entrance.
135
149
Crocuses are pushing up through the flower beds. Tiny green
buds have started to emerge from the dead black branches
150
157
Emma and Brodie come out carrying a huge white linen bag
between them.
They shake it out in the garden and birds come pouring out
of it.
High shot, looking down on EMMA as she watches the birds
wheeling round and round in the sky above.
158
170
Darwin goes outside.
DARWIN
Emma?
She looks up from the fire. Darwin crosses the lawn to her.
She's burning leaves and dead-heads from the flower garden.
DARWIN
Did you read it?
EMMA
Yes.
DARWIN
And....
EMMA
I wrapped it and put it on the
table there.
There's a brown paper parcel on the garden table where they
like to sit under the big Cyprus tree.
Darwin picks it up, it is addressed to John Murray,
Publisher, stamped and sealed with sealing wax.
EMMA
You're right. True or not it must
all be said. Probably most of it
is true. God help us.
Darwin kisses her.
92
EMMA
Careful. I have soot all over my
hands.
171
171
Darwin stands with the brown paper package, turning it over
in his hands.
DARWIN (V.O.)
Dear Hooker, I have today
despatched to John Murray the
completed manuscript. Who knows
if anyone will buy it and how
they will respond. No doubt many
will wish al diabolo altogether.
But least it is out in the world
now and no longer torturing me.
John Griffiths, the postman, comes up the hill from the
village.
Darwin gives him the manuscript. The Postman puts it in his
satchel and heads on up the lane.
Darwin turns back and walks up towards the house.
As he does so a little figure, Annie takes his hand, and
together they continue on home, Annie skipping happily by
her father's side.
172
POST-SCRIPT.
172
Darwin's "Origin of Species" was sold out on its day of
publication.
A classic to this day, it was reprinted six times before
his death; and his burial, with full Christian honours, in
Westminster Abbey.
