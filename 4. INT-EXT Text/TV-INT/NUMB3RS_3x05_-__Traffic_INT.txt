  A coin tumbles in the air -- in SUPER SLO-MO

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Chance.  Lady luck.  Randomness.  
                Humans have a hard time 
                  understanding it.

  NORMAL SPEED -- the COIN lands in the palm of a hand.  Heads.

  WIDER TO REVEAL

  CHARLIE -- (with coin) lectures a large class of undergrads. 
  (note:  more than 23, but less than 40)

  Charlie turns and projects a POWERPOINT SLIDE:  TWO GRAPHIC 
  IMAGES of DOTS.  Image  A  is full of clumps and groups of 
  dots.  Image  B  dots are spread out evenly. 

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                  Raindrops fall randomly.  Which of 
                these two most resembles raindrops 
                on a sidewalk?  Raise your hands.  
                A?  (No hands.)  B?  (All hands.)  
                Wrong.  Your brain misperceives 
                evenness as random, and wrongly 
                assumes groupings are deliberate.  

  Charlie writes 4-25 on the board.

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                Anybody here born on this day?

                              STUDENT
                Yeah, that s my birthday.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #303/40   "Traffic"   2nd PINK REV   8-15-06    2.

  A sound of surprise from another kid in the room.

                              CHARLIE
                And it s yours too, isn t it? Yeah, 
                I saw from the class files that two 
                of you have the same birthdate. 
                Doesn t that seem like quite a 
                  coincidence? What are the odds?  

  Charlie turns and writes out the odds on a clear board.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                Pretty good, actually. Out of 365 
                possible dates, with a group of 30 
                people, there s almost a 71 percent 
                chance two will share a birthday.

  He turns to the class again.

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                People don t understand random 
                chance, so they often make 
                  irrational decisions.  They re 
                afraid to work in high-rise 
                  buildings, or to live in an 
                  earthquake area. They spend money 
                on lottery tickets.

  Charlie puts up a slide of a TABLE showing causes of death 
  ranked by probabilities.

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                  A mathematical assessment of chance 
                events tells us we re far more 
                likely to suffocate in bed than be 
                killed in a terrorist attack.  Ten 
                times more likely to die from 
                alcohol than from an earthquake.  
                And it s 10 times more likely we ll 
                be killed driving to buy a lottery 
                ticket-- than it is that we ll win 
                the lottery.


  JEFF KINKIRK (42) drives.  His oldest son, ANDY (14) in the 
  seat next to him.  His younger son, PETE (9), in the back.

                              ANDY
                Dad, can we go for ice cream?

                              JEFF 
                We should be getting back home--

                              PETE
                Come on, it s on the way.  Kind of. 

                              JEFF
                Not at all, actually -- but -- 

                              ANDY
                You know you want to.

  Jeff starts angling the car toward the on-ramp--

                              JEFF
                Okay, if you put it that way--

                              PETE 
                Yea, Dad! 

  Jeff grins at Pete in the rear view mirror.

  The BACK WINDOW SHATTERS.  Like an EXPLOSION.

  Andy whips around, sees Pete frozen in horror, eyes on his 
  father.  Andy turns to see Jeff slouch on the wheel, blood 
  pours down his neck.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS    #303/40   "Traffic"   2nd PINK REV   8-15-06    4.

  The van veering off the EXIT RAMP.  Andy grabs the wheel, 
  lurches it back into the lane.  Pete screams in terror.  Andy 
  slides his left foot over.


  MARLA KINKIRK and her two sons, with DON and DAVID. 

                              MARLA 
                They said he was shot.     

                              DAVID
                We think that s what happened.  Is 
                there anyone who would want to harm 
                your husband?

                              MARLA 
                No -- no one.

  Don kneels down in front of the two boys.

                              DON
                Hey.  I m Don.  I m with the FBI.

  Andy puts a protective arm on Pete s shoulder. 

                              DON (CONT D)
                How you guys doing?

                              ANDY
                Do you know who did it? 

                              DON
                We re working on it.

                              MARLA
                I heard on the news there s been 
                attacks, on the freeways. 

                              DAVID
                That s true, but we don t know if 
                those incidents are related to the  
                attack on your husband.

  Marla sees an ER DOCTOR coming, stands. 

                              ER DOCTOR
                Mrs. Kinkirk, your husband is 
                stable.

                              MARLA
                Thank God. 

                              ER DOCTOR
                There s issues we need to discuss --

                              DAVID
                Excuse us.

  David and Don start to move away.

                              MARLA
                Please -- stay.

  The doctor glances at the boys.  Don sees, pulls them aside. 

                              ER DOCTOR
                      (sotto, to Marla)
                Your husband has sustained a 
                gunshot wound to the head.

  Marla puts an arm on David s arm to steady herself.

                              ER DOCTOR (CONT D)
                Luckily, the bullet did not 
                  penetrate far, it s lodged in the 
                right occipital lobe.  Our 
                  neurosurgeon is confident he can 
                remove it without further damage.  

  Don with the boys.  Decides to level with them.

                              DON
                What do you remember?   

                              ANDY
                I heard a loud crash from the back, 
                I turned and Pete was scared--

                              PETE
                From the noise, and then I saw the 
                blood.

                              ANDY
                I looked where Pete was looking, I 
                saw Dad was hurt.

  The memory shakes both of them -- 

                              DON
                Just before the crash, did you see 
                any particular cars you remember?

  Andy shakes his head -- 

                              PETE
                I don t know but -- I think maybe 
                there was a white truck.  I didn t 
                see who was driving it.

  Don glances at Andy.

                              ANDY
                Sorry, I didn t see it.

                              DON 
                All right.  What happened then? 

                              ANDY
                  I grabbed the wheel and -- I just 
                tried to keep us from crashing.

                              DON
                That was good thinking. 

  Pete s about to cry.  Andy squeezes his shoulder.  He keeps 
  his voice as calm as he can to ask --  

                              ANDY
                Is Dad going to be okay?

                That s what I m saying, Charlie.  
                There is no pattern.

                              CHARLIE
                Actually -- a single assailant or a 
                bunch of copycats both imply a 
                pattern.  What I m suggesting is 
                that the grouping of these 
                  shootings might be random.

                              COLBY
                Seven completely unrelated attacks?     

  Charlie digs into his satchel.  Pulls out an MP3 player.

                              CHARLIE
                Consider -- this music player has a 
                shuffle function, uses an algorithm 
                to play songs in a random order.  
                But when people listen to a random 
                shuffle, they perceive patterns.  
                But it s all coincidence.

                              MEGAN
                People swear their MP3 s like to 
                play certain songs. I know mine has 
                a thing for ZZ Top.

                              CHARLIE
                Right, because humans perceive 
                patterns that aren t there.

                      (thinking it out)
                So every few years we get a cluster 
                of violent freeway incidents --  

                              DAVID

                How you doing, Alan.  Sorry to 
                  interrupt, but -- 
                      (to Charlie)
                Can something be too random?

                              CHARLIE
                  Something can be a little random -- 
                or very random.  But, no, not too 
                random.  Why?

                              MEGAN
                We assume these freeway attacks are 
                a random series of events.  But 
                none of them can be linked to the 
                usual causes of freeway violence.

                              ALAN
                Like road rage, that sort of thing? 

                              MEGAN
                Yes.  About 70 percent of highway 
                assaults stem from arguments 
                between drivers, particularly when 
                one or both parties suffers from 
                  something called Intermittent 
                  Explosive Disorder.

                              ALAN
                I think in my day we called that 
                having a screw loose.

                              MEGAN
                Yeah, as a matter of fact my dad 
                kinda had a screw loose.  But, 
                  explosive rage is a little more 
                serious.  People can erupt into 
                  uncontrollable violence over 
                  practically nothing.

                              CHARLIE
                I gather that none of these attacks 
                stem from traffic disputes.  What 
                are other common causes?

                              CHARLIE
                That s Hidden Variable Theory.  The 
                idea that nothing in the world is 
                ever really random -- because 
                there s always some influence or 
                force we can t detect.

                              ALAN
                And is that theory a good one?

                              CHARLIE
                Einstein believed it in 1935, but 
                it proved not to be true, at least 
                in the way he thought.  Most 
                  scientists now believe that God 
                does play dice with the universe.

                              MEGAN
                Still, it s weird none of these 
                attacks are typical, not one.  

                              CHARLIE
                Weird, yes, unlikely yes.  
                  Impossible? No. The thing about 
                random sequences, they can look 
                pretty strange.

                I spent the weekend at Politzer s 
                and he completely disassembled my 
                11d supergravity theory and here I 
                am -- in 10 dimensions with two p-
                brane solutions, electrically and 
                  magnetically charged respectively 
                to the C-field...

  Charlie sees Larry s couch.  Sheets, blankets and a pillow.

                Speaking of Megan, she came by the 
                house, wanted to know if a sequence  
                can be too random. (smiles)  Funny.

                I fail to see what s funny about

                Larry, I can roll a pair of dice 
                eight times, never get the same 
                result twice and that s still in 
                the realm of random.

                              LARRY
                True.  But something that doesn t 
                repeat is not by definition random.

  Charlie looks up, alarmed, jumps off the couch.

                I have my moments.  I was looking 
                for related attacks that didn t 
                result in serious injuries.  

  They flip through the photos.

                              COLBY
                Objects used included a rock, large 
                marble.  Lead weight.  Steel pipe.

                              DAVID
                No injuries, so no police report.  

  Charlie comes in.

                              CHARLIE
                Megan, I am so sorry.

                              MEGAN

                About the attacks?

  Charlie pulls out the MP3 Player again.

                              CHARLIE
                Remember the shuffle mode?

                              DAVID
                Right, patterns that aren t there. 

                              CHARLIE
                It s controlled by an algorithm 
                that creates a random order for the 
                songs.  But it s not really random. 
                The algorithm won t repeat a song.  

                              MEGAN
                So the freeway attacks -- the lack 
                of repetition is deliberate?  
                That s what I ve been saying.

                              DAVID
                These attacks could be the work of 
                one person--

  Megan leads Charlie up to the PLASMA, turns it on.

                              MEGAN (CONT D)
                Here s five new incidents.

                              CHARLIE
                Five?  I didn t hear about that on 
                the news.

                              DAVID
                These are cases that haven t been 
                included in the series before now.

                              MEGAN
                Let s look at them placed 
                  chronologically with the others.

  Megan punches in data.  Five new incident dates appear on a 
    TIMELINE/CALENDAR for the attacks.

  Charlie studies the timeline. 

  CHARLIE VISION:

  Dates start to group and block into sequences. A numerical 
  pattern emerges.

  RETURN TO SCENE:

                              CHARLIE 
                That s a fairly regular pattern, 
                showing increasing frequency.

                              MEGAN
                  I thought so.  Guys, I m gonna call 
                this one, 99 percent sure. The 
                varied methods show an attempt to 
                avoid any discernible pattern--

                              CHARLIE
                Which is in itself a pattern.

                But what the perpetrator can t 
                disguise is the intensity of his 
                need, which compels him to act at 
                regular intervals.  And because the 
                  compulsion is growing, those 
                  intervals are shorter and shorter.  

  She turns to them, decisive --

                It s more complicated for traffic.  
                But we can use partial differential 
                  equations to calculate optimum 
                number of lanes, on and off ramps,

                  resulting in problems with anger 
                and impulse control.  He lost his 
                job, he s living on disability. 
                He s been arrested twice since the 
                accident for assault, though the 
                charges were dropped both times.

                His life was destroyed.  He might 
                blame Carol Krager, the woman who 
                didn t approve the stop light that 
                might have prevented the accident.

                Maybe his first victim set him off 
                some other way.  Once he got 
                started, he went back to Krager.

                No, because I have anger and 
                impulse problems.  It comes with 
                the frontal lobe damage.  I m

                Donnie, why you sitting in the 
                dark? 

                              DON
                Thinking about the case. 

                              ALAN
                Thank God you caught the guy.

                              DON
                After he killed five people.  
                Injured a half dozen more. And 
                  tomorrow, I got two dozen new cases 
                and it all starts up again.

                              ALAN
                You ve have tough cases lately. You 
                should some time off. 

  Don shrugs away the suggestion. 

                              ALAN (CONT D)
                It s not good to get like this.

                              DON
                Dad, I m always like this.

                              ALAN
                Donnie, listen to me--

                              DON 
                      (gently cuts him off)
                I m sorry, it s just been a long 
                day.     

  The door opens, Charlie comes in.  Carrying a satchel. 

                              CHARLIE 
                Hey, I found something interesting 
                I want you to look at.

                              DON
                      (forced casual)
                What s that, Charlie?

                              CHARLIE
                You know how I thought the freeway 
                attacks were a random series--

  As he talks, he gets some paperwork out of his satchel.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                They weren t.  MacKenzie was behind 
                all of them.  But he didn t 
                actually start the sequence. 

                              DON
                How do you mean? 

                              CHARLIE
                  A hit-and-run driver started it 
                when he struck MacKenzie. A head 
                injury left him unable to control 
                his rage and impulses.

                              ALAN
                But Charlie, he s still responsible 
                for his own actions.

                              CHARLIE 
                Of course. But the driver who hurt 
                him was never apprehended.  He got 
                away with it.

  He puts papers on the table, Don picks up an ACCIDENT REPORT. 

                              DON
                  MacKenzie s accident report.
                Where d you get all this?

  He starts going through paperwork Charlie s brought -- 

                              CHARLIE
                Megan called the CHP for me.  I 
                thought you might want to take a 
                look at it.

  Don s studying the papers.  He doesn t see --

  Charlie meet Alan s eyes.  Charlie gives his father a small 
  quick smile. 

  Alan realizes what Charlie s trying to do.

  Charlie turns back to Don.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                I d could work on this with you.

                              DON 
                Tire treads, paint and metal 
                evidence -- there s a lot here.

                              CHARLIE
                Got to be a way to narrow down a 
                suspect list.

                              DON
                Yeah, I think you re right --

  Don and Charlie bend over the papers, talking intently.

  Alan s watching, concern etched on his face.
