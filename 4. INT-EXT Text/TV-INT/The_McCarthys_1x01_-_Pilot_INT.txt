      RONNY McCARTHY (late 20s, tall, neurotic) sits on his sofa 
      watching The Sound of Music.  His father, ARTHUR McCARTHY 
      (60s, tall, not always politically correct), sits at the 
      other end of the sofa reading The Boston Globe.  Arthur looks 
      up and sees Julie Andrews on screen wearing a big floppy hat 
      and carrying a weird shaped bag--a valise.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Is that Mary Poppins?

                                  RONNY
                          (torn, then)
                    Yes.

      They watch for a bit.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Is she Mary Poppins in this?

                                  RONNY
                          (firmly)
                    No.

      They watch a bit more.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Well, I like her gym bag. 

      MARJORIE McCARTHY (50s, loving, exhausted, no filter) enters 
      wearing a nice black dress.  She watches Julie Andrews on TV. 

                                  MARJORIE
                          (to the TV)
                    That s right, Maria, run back to 
                    the nunnery.  Why should you take 
                    care of Christa-fah Plummah s kids?  
                          (to her husband)
                    Ar-tha, why are ya up here in 
                    Ronny s apahtment?  The wake s in 
                    an hour.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I was reading Fatty s obituary.  
                    The Globe actually called him James 
                     Fatty  McFadden.
                          (sweetly)
                    He would ve liked that.                                                                                      2.


                                  MARJORIE
                    Ronny, I need your rent.  Also, 
                    we re gonna miss The Solver when 
                    we re at the wake, so VCR it.

                                  RONNY
                    I thought you hated The Solver.

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:



      Marjorie and Ronny watch TV.  Maura Tierney is on screen.

                                  MAURA TIERNEY
                          (putting down a folder 
                            dramatically)
                    I solved it.

                                  MARJORIE
                          (yells at TV)
                    I solved it!  That s your 
                      catchphrase?!  You re an 
                      embarrassment, Maura Tierney! 

                                                                            BACK TO:


                                  MARJORIE (CONT D)
                    Hey, you and I gotta watch 
                    somethin  on Friday nights.  Is The 
                    Solver as good as The Closer?  No.  
                    It s offensive to Kyra Sedgwick to 
                    even ask that.  But The Closer s 
                    ovah, and we have to move on!
                          (then)
                    God, I miss it.

                                  RONNY
                    About Friday nights--. 

                                  MARJORIE
                    Where s Jackie?  Need her rent.

                                  RONNY
                    She s trying on dresses.

      They hear a HOWL OF RAGE from one of the bedrooms.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Sounds like they fit.                                                                                        3.


      A smoke alarm goes off downstairs.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Oh shit, the baked potatoes.

      Marjorie exits.  JACKIE McCARTHY enters from her bedroom.  
      She s late 20s, overweight, and swings wildly from 
      overconfidence to insecurity.  She s also desperate for 
      attention, which may explain her VERY SPARKLY DRESS. 

                                  JACKIE
                          (looking for a fight)
                    Don t staht with me!  This dress is 
                    perfectly appropriate for a wake!  
                    I m dressed to CELEBRATE Fatty s 
                    life!  It s a pahty for the dead!  
                    It s a jazzy remembrance!
                          (can t keep it up)
                    It s the ONLY DRESS THAT FIT!
                          (angry at the world)
                    I HATE EVERYTHING!

      Jackie sits between Ronny and Arthur on the sofa.  She takes 
      the remote and switches from the movie to a basketball game. 

                                  RONNY
                    Dad, I guess we ll continue our in-
                    depth discussion of the film later. 

                                  ARTHUR
                          (already into the game)
                    What?  Huh?  Oh.  I m good.

      SEAN McCARTHY (early 30s, dim, tall, chubby) comes down from 
      the third floor apartment.  He s a former star athlete, but 
      the only thing he s maintained is his upbeat attitude.  Right 
      behind him is GERARD McCARTHY (30, competitive, very short).  
      He s the one little guy in the family and mad about it.  

                                  SEAN
                          (noticing the game)
                    That center s like a young me.

                                  GERARD
                    Sean, that center s like you if you 
                    were black, a hundred pounds 
                    lighter and actually knew how to 
                    pass the ball sometimes.

                                  SEAN
                          (sincerely)
                    Gerard, I couldn t pass to you in 
                    high school because the bench was 
                    out of bounds.                                                                                        4.


      Gerard is pissed.  Marjorie returns and looks at her family.  

                                  MARJORIE 
                          (to herself, weary)
                    God, I ve got a lotta kids.
                          (then, louder)
                    We re going to a wake.  We don t 
                    have time to watch basketball!

                                  ARTHUR
                    Fatty was my assistant coach for 
                    nineteen years.  Watching 
                      basketball is how we honor him. 

                                  JACKIE
                    I can t believe he s dead!

      Jackie starts sobbing.    

                                  GERARD
                    Jackie!  It s not a competition to 
                    see who can be saddest!

                                  MARJORIE
                    Oh, Jackie.  Cheer up.  At least 
                    you re presenting at the Academy 
                    Awards.  Apparently.
                          (then)
                    I need everyone s rent please.

      Gerard, Sean, and Jackie hand her checks.

                                  RONNY
                    I have an announcement.

      People split their attention between Ronny and the game.

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    Seeing our old friend Fatty die so 
                    suddenly has reminded me that life 
                    is short.  And I think I ve been in 
                    a real rut for a while now.  So 
                    I ve decided to make a serious 
                    effort to get a boyfriend.

      Jackie mutes the TV.  Everyone s listening now.   

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    Instead of watching The Closer, I 
                    want to go out and be A Closer.

                                    SEAN/GERARD
                    Ronny, no./ We hate wordplay.                                                                                      5.


                                  RONNY
                    Good feedback.  Thanks.  I ll miss 
                    that kind of support because I m 
                    giving my thirty days notice.  I m 
                    moving out.  
                          (off their shocked looks)
                    Living in a three decker with all 
                    of you, while delightful, will not 
                    help me find a guy.  I mean, what 
                    do I do if I meet someone?  Parade 
                    him past all of you?

                                  SEAN
                          (sincerely)
                    You guys do love to parade.

      Ronny looks at his mother, who seems particularly shocked. 

                                  MARJORIE
                    You're still gay?

                                  RONNY
                    What?  Yeah.  I came out like two 
                    years ago.  Don t you remember?

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:



                                  MARJORIE
                    Wow.  That s big news.  Should we 
                    have a highball? 

                                  RONNY
                    Okay, but isn t 10 AM a little 
                    early for whiskey?

                                  ARTHUR
                    We didn t judge you.

                                                                            BACK TO:



                                  MARJORIE
                    Well, of course I remember.  But 
                    since that day, we've never met 
                    anyone you ve dated.  So I didn't 
                    know if you were still pursuin' it.

                                  RONNY
                    Um.  Yup.  Still giving it a go.                                                                                      6.


                                  MARJORIE
                          (not pleased)
                    And I guess that means cutting all 
                    ties with your family.  How nice.

                                  RONNY
                    No!  I just spend so much time with 
                    you guys that I m starting to feel 
                    like I m...theoretically gay.  As 
                    opposed to actually gay.

      They all stare at him.   

                                  GERARD
                    Fun fact.  Saying  theoretically 
                    gay  made you sound actually gay.  

                                  SEAN
                    Which was your goal!

                                  JACKIE
                    So now you don t have to move out!

                                  SEAN
                    He s staying!  Yay!

      Ronny s siblings start clapping and chanting.

                                      SEAN/GERARD/JACKIE
                    Ronny!  Ronny!  Ronny!

      Arthur joins in without really knowing why he s doing it. 

                                  RONNY
                          (yelling over the chant)
                    No!  I m not staying!  Guys, this 
                    is not a cogent argument!  You re 
                    just clapping and repeating a word!

      They continue chanting anyway.

                                  MARJORIE
                          (to Ronny)
                    You re tearing this family apart.

      Off Ronny s stressed out look...

                                                                          FADE OUT.


      END COLD OPEN                                                                                      7.


      ACT ONE

      FADE IN:



      The whole family s in the car.  Arthur drives.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Well, the A.D. did say it was up to 
                    me.  And I would like to pass my 
                    dynasty off to a McCarthy.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Pick Jackie then.  She s dressed 
                    like she s on Dynasty.

      Jackie scowls.

                                  RONNY
                    You know, my tenth grade class is 
                    reading King Lear right now, and I 
                    gotta say, this situation is very 
                    King Lear.  A father passing on his 
                    kingdom.  His children fighting.  

      Ronny s siblings stare at him.

                                      SEAN/JACKIE/GERARD
                    Thanks Ronny./Good tidbit./Perfect 
                    time for Shakespeare.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Ronny, don t interrupt your 
                    siblings attempts to become more 
                    involved with their family.

                                  SEAN
                    Dad, as a two-time Boston Globe All 
                    Star, I just wanna remind you that 
                    I was a two-time Boston Globe All 
                    Star.  Also, I m not a screamer 
                    like Gerard is with your JV team.

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:



      A ninth grader on Gerard s team shoots an air ball from the 
      foul line.  Fans yell,  Shake it off  and  Good try.                                                                                         10.


                                  GERARD
                    THAT S WHY YOU PLAY JV!

      Everyone is shocked and looking at Gerard, who repeats...

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    THAT S WHY YOU PLAY JV!

                                                                            BACK TO:



                                  GERARD
                    Sean, you re too OUT OF SHAPE to 
                    yell!  You had to take a rest while 
                    you were getting INTO THE CAR!

                                  JACKIE
                    Dad, forget those two.  I ve 
                    coached at all your summer camps, 
                    and I m a cable access celebrity!

                                  MARJORIE
                    And, Jackie, how many times have 
                    you been fined for swearing when 
                      announcing the games on cable?

                                  JACKIE
                          (mutters angrily)
                    Only two BLEEP times.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Wow.  You are a real lady, Jackie.  
                    To think I named you after Jackie 
                    Kennedy.  Which is possibly the 
                    real reason that family is cursed.

                                  JACKIE
                    You can t pin John John on me!

      Sean, Gerard, and Jackie start yelling over each other.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Hey!  If you all don t shut up, 
                    none of you are getting the job!

      An awkward silence fills the car.  Jackie starts crying.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Don t waste it on us, Annette 
                    Bening.  Save it for the wake.

      Ronny laughs.                                                                                    11.


                                  MARJORIE (CONT D)
                    Don t laugh at my jokes, Ronny.

                                  RONNY
                    Don t make Annette Bening jokes 
                    that only appeal to your gay son.

                                    GERARD/JACKIE
                    Uch.  Again?/ We get it, Ronny!  
                    You re gay!



      Like most Irish-American wakes in Boston, Fatty s is loud and 
      feels like a party.  Fatty s body is in what looks like a 
      double wide open casket, and there s a basketball in his dead 
      hands.  The McCarthys wait to sign the guest book.  Sean and 
      Ronny are next to each other at the end of the line.   

                                  SEAN
                    Ronny, I m actually really proud of 
                    you for trying to meet someone.

                                  RONNY
                          (touched)
                    Thanks.

                                  SEAN
                    I mean, if you want some penis, you 
                    gotta work for it, right?

                                  RONNY
                            (uncomfortable)
                    Right.  That is what I always 
                    say...and how I always phrase it.

                                  SEAN
                    Hey.  Here s some now.

      Sean indicates a handsome FUNERAL DIRECTOR, who stands near 
      the guest book.  Sean walks up and starts signing. 

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                          (to Funeral Director)
                    Hey, I m Sean.  And this is my 
                    brother Ronny, who was just saying 
                    how handsome you look in that black 
                    suit.  Once you go black right?

      Sean smiles and walks away.  Ronny is mortified.                                                                                      12.


                                  RONNY
                    I m sorry.  That expression is not 
                    about suits.  He s insane.  I did 
                    not say any of that.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                          (smiling)
                    Even the handsome part?

      Ronny looks surprised and then smiles too.


      ANGLE ON: 

      Arthur talks to some other coaches, including JOHN COLWELL (a 
      typical Boston asshole). 

                                  JOHN COLWELL
                    It s a shame Fatty never lived to 
                    see you coach a team all the way to 
                    the state title, Arthur.  But then 
                    again, I guess it would have been 
                      impossible for him to live forevah.

      The other coaches laugh.  Arthur tries to laugh too.

                                  JOHN COLWELL (CONT D)
                    And this is your last chance at a 
                    title before you retire.  Maybe you 
                    should try to get Darryl Silver.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (covering)
                    He s great, but he lives in New 
                    York.  Hey, if we re putting 
                    together a fantasy team, let s go 
                    all the way with it.  I want Bird, 
                    and Jordan, and Catherine Zeta 
                    Jones.

                                  JOHN COLWELL
                    Arthur, I know you re trying to get 
                    Darryl.  I also know that Darryl s 
                    gonna play for me at St. Barnabus.  
                    But, hey, I ll tell him you re 
                      interested.  Maybe he s got some 
                    sort of state-championship-phobia.

      The others laugh. 

                                  ARTHUR
                          (seething, but covering)
                    Well, Coach Colwell, today s about 
                    grieving, not recruiting.                                                                                    13.


      Arthur walks solemnly over to Fatty s casket.  When he kneels 
      to pray, his cell phone rings, and he answers immediately. 

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Mrs. Silver?  No, no, perfect time!

      Arthur walks outside hoping for good news about Darryl.

      ANGLE ON:

      Ronny s still talking to the Funeral Director, who s smiling.  

                                  RONNY
                            (flirtatiously)
                    I m going to write my number in the 
                    guest book here, oh, just because.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                          (looks at it, puzzled)
                    Wait.  Does your whole family all 
                    really live at the same address?

                                  RONNY
                    Oh, yeah, but, um...I'm moving out 
                    real soon.  And the only reason 
                    we ve all stayed there is because 
                    we all teach or coach at the high 
                    school down the street.  So it s 
                    super convenient.
                          (off his look)
                    I guess the main thing though is 
                    that I'm moving out real soon.

                                    FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                    It seems...kind of...creepy.

                                  RONNY
                    Wow.  So you...
                          (gestures to casket)
                    ...think I m creepy. 
                          (picks up pen again)
                    Okay, I m gonna write the word 
                     irony  in the guest book.  Because 
                    it did just pay us a visit.  

      Ronny tries to march off dramatically but ends up knocking 
      over a photo collage of Fatty.  Marjorie approaches and helps 
      Ronny put it back on the stand. 

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    Thanks, Mom.                                                                                    14.


                                  MARJORIE
                          (sad)
                    Happy to help.  Might be the last 
                    thing we ever do together.

                                  RONNY
                    Here we go.

                                  MARJORIE
                     Gay sons are the best.   Your Aunt 
                    Katie told me that when you were 
                    four years old and playing with a 
                    doll.  She said,  He s a little 
                    weird, sure.  But he ll take care 
                    of you when you re old.  And some 
                    of them even like to iron.   Well, 
                    Aunt Katie was full of it.  You 
                    never did my ironing.  And now 
                    this.

                                  RONNY
                    Aunt Katie drank perfume.

                                  MARJORIE
                    I just can t believe you re moving 
                    out.  It s appropriate that we re 
                    at a wake.  We can mourn both Fatty 
                    ...and my happiness.  Now that my 
                    favorite son is abandoning me.

                                  RONNY
                    Jesus.  Who s Annette Bening now?
                          (then)
                    And why are we using her name this 
                    way?  She s a very nuanced actress!  

      They see Arthur return and walk to the front of the room.  

                                  ARTHUR
                    Excuse me, everyone.  If I could 
                    have your attention for a minute.  
                    I wanted to say a few words about 
                    Fatty McFadden.  

      The crowd quiets down, comforted by someone eulogizing Fatty.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    He and I worked so well together 
                    that we only ever fought about one 
                    thing.  Why he was called Fatty.  
                    He thought it was a nickname for 
                    McFadden.  I thought it was for 
                    other reasons.                                                                                    15.


      The crowd laughs.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Reasons that cause a 44 year old 
                    man to have a heart attack. 

      No one laughs.  Most grimace.  Marjorie shakes her head.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    But as big as Fatty s ass was, his 
                    heart was even bigger.  And he 
                    always rooted for the underdog.  
                    The fact that our team won the 
                    league every year but never won a 
                    state title drove him crazy.  And I 
                    hope he s looking down and 
                    listening right now because we re 
                    gonna win that title this season--
                    for him.  And, in fact, I just got 
                    some very exciting news.  Darryl 
                    Silver will be playing for our team 
                    this year.

      Some people in the crowd buzz with excitement.  Others wonder 
      why this eulogy has become a press conference.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    And the person I think should be my 
                    new assistant and help me get that 
                    title is someone Fatty would 
                      definitely approve of.

      Sean, Gerard, and Jackie all look hopeful.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    He s a real underdog, and the best 
                    man for the job.  My son Ronny!

      Everyone is stunned, especially Ronny.  

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    In fact, I d like to give Ronny the

                            whispers in his ear)

      ACT TWO

      FADE IN:



      All four siblings are yelling at Arthur. 

                                      GERARD/SEAN/JACKIE
                    Ronny?!/ Seriously!/ Why not pick 
                    Mom?!

                                  RONNY
                    I don t want this job, Dad!  And 
                    I m not even remotely qualified!  

                                      JACKIE/GERARD/SEAN
                    Yeah!/ See!/ He s a dummy!

                                  MARJORIE
                          (calmly sipping a 
                            highball)
                    This is fun.

                                  ARTHUR
                    It s a surprising choice, but Ronny 
                    knows the players from teaching at 
                    the school, and more importantly, 
                    he thinks like a winner.
                          (off their dubious looks)
                    When Ronny wants something, he goes 
                    after it.  Like this whole try-to-
                      find-a-boyfriend thing.  

                                  JACKIE
                    What?!  Ronny is terrible at 
                    finding boyfriends, and he'll be 
                    even worse at coaching! 

                                  RONNY
                    Well, I d say it s probably a tie.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I think you three are being 
                    offensive to Ronny.

                                  SEAN
                    We re not saying a gay man can t 
                    coach basketball.  We're saying 
                    Ronny can't coach basketball.                                                                                    17.


                                  GERARD
                    We're not offensive to gays, 
                    Ronny's offensive to basketball.  

                                  RONNY
                    And even if I were interested, I d 
                    still say no.  I ve got to focus on 
                    more important goals.  I need love 
                    and passion in my life way more 
                    than I need a coach job.

                                  JACKIE
                      Seriously?!  Who says  coach job ?

                                  GERARD
                    Who says  passion ?!  

                                  SEAN
                    Who says  if I were ?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Ronny, the choice is yours, but I'd 
                    love to spend more time with the 
                    son I know the least.

                                  RONNY
                          (surprised and moved)
                    Really?  You would?

      Father and son share a rare real moment.

                                      JACKIE/SEAN/GERARD
                    Gross./ What is happening?/  
                    Suddenly we have emotions?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Just don t say no yet, Ronny.  
                    Sleep on it.

                                  RONNY
                          (after a beat)
                    Okay.  I ll think about it.

                                    SEAN/GERARD
                    WHAT?/ THIS IS CRAZY!

                                  JACKIE
                    I think I m gonna throw up.

      No one believes her.  Marjorie rolls her eyes.

                                  GERARD
                    Oh, we re doing drama?  Here s some 
                    more!  I quit as JV coach!                                                                                    18.


      Gerard storms off.  Everyone is silent.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Jackie, look what you did.

                                  JACKIE
                    I didn t EVEN DO ANYTHING!

      Jackie s so mad she throws her purse at the wall hard.

                                  MARJORIE
                    See.  I knew you d do something.



      Sean and Gerard enter.  Ronny is dressed up.  Jackie looks 
      like shit and sits on the sofa in her robe. 

                                  SEAN
                    So you slept on it, Ronny.  Are you 
                    taking the coaching job or not?

                                  GERARD
                    Ronny, you DON T KNOW BASKETBALL!  
                    When we were talking about the  86 
                    Celtics, you started yappin  about 
                      a wheelchair kid from Glee!  

                                  RONNY
                    For the millionth time, THAT 
                    ACTOR s NAME IS KEVIN McHALE!  I 
                    GOT CONFUSED!  

                                  SEAN
                    Wait, Ronny, why are you all 
                    gussied up? 

                                  JACKIE
                    He s going to a gay bah happy hour.

                                  GERARD
                    So you stole a job from us and now 
                    you re celebrating!  Real nice!

                                  SEAN
                            (considering the phrase)
                     Gay bah happy hour.   You know 
                    what s fun?  Gay and happy mean the 
                    same thing, so you could also call 
                    it,  Happy Bah Gay Hour. 

                                  GERARD
                    Sean, that s NOT FUN!  Focus!                                                                                    19.


                                  RONNY
                    What if I did coach with Dad?  What 
                    do you care, Gerard?  You re a 
                    great coach!  Go get another job!

                                  GERARD
                          (as if he s been insulted)
                    What the hell does that mean?  I m 
                    a  great coach .

                                  RONNY
                    Okay.  We should really be nicer to 
                    each other if we can t even 
                    recognize a sincere compliment.

                                  SEAN
                    Gerard, now he s saying you can t 
                    even recognize stuff.

                                  RONNY 
                          (to Gerard)
                    Remember when I was still playing 
                    junior high hoop, and I was afraid 
                    of the ball. 

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:



      Young Gerard holds a basketball and talks to Young Ronny.

                                  GERARD
                    We re going to play Dangerous 
                    Catch!  

                                  RONNY
                    But Mom s Waterford crystal and 
                    hummels are in here.

                                  GERARD
                    THAT S WHY IT S CALLED DANGEROUS 
                    CATCH!

      Gerard whips the ball at Ronny, who screams.

                                  RONNY
                    But they re so valuable!

      Ronny miraculously catches the ball.  He s amazed.

                                                                            BACK TO:                                                                                    20.



                                  GERARD
                    That was fun back then.  Being 
                    taller than you.

                                  RONNY
                    Gerard, you found a strategy--
                      terror--that helped me catch the 
                    ball.  You re a good coach, and 
                    there are other people in the world 
                    who ll see that besides Dad.  

                                  GERARD
                          (touched but covering)
                    This time you said  good coach.   
                    Last time you said  great.   Why 
                    the change?

                                  SEAN
                    Hey, Ronny, what about me?  

                                  RONNY
                    Sean, a wise man once said to me, 
                     If you want some penis, you gotta 
                    work for it.  

                                  SEAN
                    I don t know, Ronny.  Penis just 
                    ain t for me.

                                  RONNY
                    I m saying figure out what you want 
                    and go do something to get it!

      Sean mulls that over and nods.  He and Gerard start to leave.

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    Hey, guys!  All that stuff I just 
                    said was sort of like coaching.  
                    Maybe I really could be good at it.

      Gerard and Sean look at Ronny.  It s as if they re seeing him 
      for the first time.  Then...

                                  SEAN
                    No.  You d be bad at it.

      They start to exit.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                          (to Gerard)
                    It s cute.  He wants to be like us.                                                                                    21.


                                  GERARD
                            (frustrated)
                    There is no US.

                                  SEAN
                    We re practically roommates.

                                  GERARD
                    We are NOT ROOMMATES!  I live with 
                    my wife, and you live in the creepy 
                    attic room above us!  Which my wife 
                    does NOT like.

                                  SEAN
                          (mumbling)
                    Your wife doesn t like anything.

                                  GERARD
                    MUMBLING DOESN T WORK IF YOU DO IT 
                    RIGHT NEXT TO ME!

      They exit.  Ronny looks at Jackie, who does a slow clap. 

                                  JACKIE
                          (dramatically)
                    Well, you've fixed their problems, 
                    but I bet you can't help me, Oprah.

      She starts sobbing and won't stop.  Ronny puts on his coat.   

                                  RONNY
                    I m going out to look for love 
                    tonight, and no family drama is 
                    going to stop me!

      Jackie runs to the bathroom.  Ronny hears her throwing up.

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    Not even that.  Not even really 
                    loud vomiting. 
                          (then)
                    Wow, that s loud. 

                                                                          SMASH TO:



      Jackie leans over the toilet as Ronny enters with Marjorie.

                                  RONNY
                    There s actually been more crying 
                    than vomiting.  She won t tell me 
                    what s wrong.                                                                                    22.


                                  MARJORIE
                          (whispers to Ronny)
                    I ll get it out of her.

      Marjorie starts rubbing Jackie s back.

                                  MARJORIE (CONT D)
                          (with a Southern accent)
                    That s it, darlin .  Get that nasty 
                    old poison out.  And I ll get you a 
                    long, cool glass a ginger ale.

                                  RONNY
                          (sotto)
                      A Southern accent?  Oh my God.  Are 
                    you trying to be The Closer?

      Marjorie shushes him.

                                  MARJORIE
                          (Southern accent)
                    What confuses me, Jackie, is why--.   

                                  JACKIE
                          (blurts)
                    I m pregnant with Fatty s baby!

      Marjorie and Ronny stare at each other in shock.

                                  RONNY
                    Wow.  That accent really works.

                                  MARJORIE
                    You slept with Fatty McFadden?!

                                  JACKIE
                    Yes!  He was my lover!

      Marjorie and Ronny wince.  Jackie sobs even louder.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Stop crying and tell me what you re 
                    going to do about all this! 

                                  JACKIE
                    I have no idea!  It s just a big 
                    mess!  And the worst thing is...

                                  MARJORIE
                    What?!  WHAT S WORSE THAN THIS?!

                                  JACKIE
                      I just...I know I won t be nearly 
                    as good a mother as you were.                                                                                    23.


      Marjorie is stunned.  She can barely speak.   

                                  MARJORIE
                    You thought I was a good mother?

                                  JACKIE
                    I mean you re tough.  Sure.  But, 
                    yeah, I think you re great.

      Marjorie considers this for a moment and then says... 

                                  MARJORIE
                    Once again, you ve made a huge 
                    mistake.  You said you won t be a 
                    good mother, but you will.   Cause 
                    I'm gonna help you with the baby.

                                  JACKIE
                    Oh my god!  Really?!

                                  MARJORIE
                          (wary)
                    Yes.

                                  JACKIE
                    Oh thank you!  Thank you!
                          (hugging her, then)
                    But can we please wait to tell Dad?

                                  MARJORIE
                    Gladly.

      The three of them look at each other.

                                  JACKIE
                    If Fatty was here, he would thank 
                    you both.  He was respectful.  As a 
                    man and a lover.

                                    RONNY/MARJORIE
                          (standing up)
                    I m out./ Gotta go.



      Marjorie heads downstairs.  Ronny comes out of his apartment.

                                  RONNY
                    You were really great with Jackie.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Well, I m surprised she even needed 
                    her mother.                                                                                      24.

                                  MARJORIE (CONT'D)
                    Most people don't seem to these 
                    days.  Most people just move out. 

                                  RONNY
                          (fed up)
                    Hey!  Everyone always needs their 
                    mother!  And they especially need 
                    her when they're trying something 
                    new, like finding a boyfriend!

                                  MARJORIE
                    Well, I don t know how to do that!

                                  RONNY
                    Well, neither do I!  So maybe try 
                    to help me figure it out!  Be like 
                    Maura Tierney and crack the case!  
                    Then you can say,  I solved it!  

                                  MARJORIE
                    I will NEVER say that!  It is a 
                    TERRIBLE catchphrase! 

      Arthur comes out of his apartment.

                                  ARTHUR
                    What the hell is going on?

                                  RONNY
                          (pointing at his father)
                    Dad thinks I can make changes in my 
                    life.  Why can t you be like him?

                                  MARJORIE
                    Oh you guys are close now?  He says 
                    you can coach and suddenly you re 
                    Lloyd and Jeff Bridges?!

                                  RONNY
                    Yes we are!  And why is that your 
                    example?!  You know what, Dad?  I 
                      officially accept your offer to be 
                    assistant coach!  

                                  MARJORIE
                    You can t do that!  It s crazy!      

                                  RONNY
                    I can do that, Mom!  And it s not 
                    crazy!  Why wouldn t I spend more 
                    time with Dad?  He thinks I m a 
                    winner!  He makes me believe I can 
                    have it all!  A guy, my own 
                      apartment, and a coach job!                                                                                      25.

                                  RONNY (CONT'D)
                    Might even get some new sweaters or 
                    lamps!  I don t know.  This is just 
                    off the top of my head!  But it s 
                    all because my dad believes in me!

                                  ARTHUR
                    Ronny, stop pickin  on your mutha!  
                    She s not the bad one!  I am.  

      Marjorie and Ronny both look confused.

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                          (very uncomfortable)
                    I do believe in you, Ronny, but the 
                    truth is...Darryl Silver's mother 
                    is a lez.  And she wants her son to 
                    play at a school that's tolerant 
                    and gay friendly.  When I told her 
                    my gay son was my assistant...she 
                    said Darryl would play for me.  

      Marjorie and Ronny are both shocked.  Ronny turns to Arthur.  

                                  RONNY
                    So basically you just used me.
                          (getting more upset)
                    Let me say this so you understand.
                          (yelling like a ref)
                    Foul!

      Before Arthur can apologize or explain that Ronny was making 
      the  time out  gesture instead of the  foul  gesture, Ronny 
      storms off.  Marjorie looks at Arthur for a long time.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Just a heads up.  Not sure the 
                    tolerant folks are saying 'lez' 
                    these days.

                                                                          FADE OUT.


      END ACT TWO                                                                                    26.


      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:



      Marjorie reads in bed.  Arthur enters looking sad.

                                  ARTHUR
                    All my kids hate me.  This whole 
                    situation really is like King Lear.
                          (off her dubious look)
                    Going through a tough time.  You 
                    couldn t just let me have that one?   

                                  MARJORIE
                    I m sorry.  And no, I couldn t.  

                                  ARTHUR
                    Ronny won t talk to me, and Jackie 
                    seems even more bizarre than usual.

                                  MARJORIE
                          (lying for Jackie)
                    Oh, Jackie?  No.  She s always been 
                    that bizarre.  When she was born, 
                    the doctor was like,  It s a girl.  
                    And she s bizarre.   That s just 
                    Jackie. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    You re right.  What about Ronny?  

                                  MARJORIE
                    I ll try to think of a way we can 
                    make him forgive us.  But he s 
                    pretty upset.  It won t be easy.

      She goes back to her book.  Suddenly she puts it down.  A 
      plan has come to her.  She grabs the phone.

                                  MARJORIE (CONT D)
                          (excited)
                    I gotta call Jackie!  And Sean and 
                    Gerard!  I solved it!
                          (then)
                    Damn it!  Why would I ever say 
                    that?



      Jackie enters and sees a grumpy Ronny in bed with his laptop.                                                                                    27.


                                  JACKIE
                    Ronny, get up!

                                  RONNY
                    No!

                                  JACKIE
                    You ve been in here for almost 
                      twenty-four hours!  I m taking that  
                    laptop.  Porn won t help!

                                  RONNY
                    It s Grey s Anatomy.

                                  JACKIE
                    That s even worse.  Now get up!

                                  RONNY
                    NO!

      She drags him out of bed and throws him into the hallway.

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    What the hell?

                                  JACKIE
                    I m crazy strong from the baby 
                    hormones.  Cool, right?



      Jackie steers a surprised Ronny to their parents  apartment.

                                  RONNY
                    Liar!  You said we were going out!

                                  JACKIE
                    Out to Sunday dinner.

                                  RONNY
                    No!

      Jackie pushes him to her parents  door.

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    God, you are strong.

      Marjorie opens the door. 

                                  MARJORIE
                    Thank you, Jackie.  You can go in.

      Jackie makes sure Ronny isn t leaving, and then enters.                                                                                    28.


                                  MARJORIE (CONT D)
                          (looking guilt-ridden)
                    I need to apologize.  I understand 
                    why you wanna move out.  It s 
                      just...I m gonna miss you.  A lot.  

      Ronny softens.

                                  MARJORIE (CONT D)
                    I also know that I haven't been 
                      supportive enough of your efforts 
                    to meet someone.  None of us have.  
                    And we hope this makes up for it. 



      Marjorie leads Ronny into the family room.

                                  MARJORIE
                          (proudly)
                    We made you a gay bah!

      Ronny s shocked because there are some gay people there.

                                  MARJORIE (CONT D)
                    Look at all your options!

      Ronnie looks more closely and realizes that his options 
      aren t great.  Jackie brings over an average guy (TOMMY).

                                  JACKIE
                    Ronny, you remember my junior prom 
                    date Tommy O Gara?  Tommy s gay 
                    now!  Yeah.  Little bit of false 
                      advertising back in the day for old 
                    Jackie.  Ha ha.
                          (then)
                      Seriously, Tommy, that s a crappy 
                    thing to do to a girl.  I chipped 
                    in for a party van.  I mean, c mon.

      Gerard brings over an IRISH GUY (30s, tall, plain, intense).

                                  GERARD
                    Here s mine.  Declan from Galway.  
                    Irish accent.  Sexy right?

                                  IRISH GUY
                    I need a green card.

                                  RONNY
                    Wait.  That doesn t make any sense.  
                    Are you even gay?                                                                                    29.


                                  IRISH GUY
                    I ll do what it takes.

      Marjorie grabs Ronny and introduces him to a GROSS LIBRARIAN.  

                                  MARJORIE
                    Your father and I wanted you to 
                    meet Mr. Brown from the library.

                                  GROSS LIBRARIAN
                            (condescendingly)
                    I already have a partner.

                                  RONNY
                    Um.  Okay.

                                  GROSS LIBRARIAN
                    But I did bring you some books on 
                      homosexuality.  Think you ll enjoy. 

      Ronny sees Menage: Party for Three.  The librarian nods.

                                  RONNY
                    Oh, thanks, but I don t read... 
                    scary books.    

      Sean walks over with his offering.

                                  SEAN
                    Lesbian.  Best I could do.  I work 
                    at a lot of basketball camps.  
                    These are the gays I meet.



      This whole motley crew sits at the dining room table. 

                                  JACKIE
                          (flirty, to Tommy)
                    Tommy, there s something still 
                    here, right?  Or am I crazy?  Also, 
                    do you like kids? 

                                  RONNY
                          (to Irish Guy)
                    You know gay marriage isn t legal 
                    yet, right?

                                  IRISH GUY
                    I ll wait.                                                                                      30.


                                  ARTHUR
                          (raising a glass)
                    I just want to welcome our guests 
                    and say how glad I am that all of 
                    my children are here.

      People clink glasses and drink.  Ronny does not.  He s still 
      pissed at his father.  Arthur notices this and looks sad.

                                  GERARD
                    I have news!  But first, apologies.  
                    My wife Katrina feels bad that she 
                    couldn t make it tonight. 

                                    SEAN/RONNY/JACKIE 
                    Oh./ Well./ She should never feel 
                    bad about that.  

                                  GERARD
                          (too excited to notice 
                            their sarcasm)
                    Now the news!  I was inspired by 
                    some stuff Ronny said, so I 
                    followed up on a job I heard about 
                    at the wake, and I m proud to say 
                    that I will be assistant coach to 
                    John Colwell at St. Barnabus!

      People ad lib congratulations.  Gerard looks at Arthur.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Working for my arch rival?  Wow.
                          (then, sincerely)
                    Good for you, Gerard.  

      Before a surprised Gerard can respond, Sean stands up.

                                  SEAN
                    Well, also inspired by Ronny, I 
                    made some calls too, and, I will be 
                    the JV coach at St. Barnabus!

      People ad lib congratulations.  

                                  GERARD
                    Are you KIDDING me?!  No!  NO!

                                  ARTHUR
                    Colwell s buildin  a real brain 
                    trust over there.  Good work, Sean!

                                  SEAN
                    Thanks, Dad!  Gerard, we re gonna 
                    be roommates and workmates!                                                                                    31.


                                  GERARD
                    WE ARE NOT ROOMMATES!

      While Gerard yells, Jackie sees the lesbian talking to Tommy.

                                  JACKIE
                    Hey, Tommy s mine.  Back off, slut!

                                  SEAN
                    Jackie!  Don t call her that!

                                  ARTHUR
                    And don t call her a lez.

                                  JACKIE
                    I m sorry!  I m emotional!  
                    Because--
                          (dramatically)
                    Because I was Fatty McFadden's 
                    lover!  And I m carrying his child!

                                    SEAN/GERARD
                    No!/ Gross.

      A shocked Arthur looks at Marjorie.

                                  MARJORIE
                          (badly feigning surprise)
                    What?!  

                                  ARTHUR 
                    Jackie, please tell me this is a 
                    joke!  Fatty was my friend.  You re 
                    my daughter!  He would never!

                                  JACKIE
                    He would always!

                                  ARTHUR
                    He wouldn t!

                                  JACKIE
                    He would!

                                  GERARD
                    So you were really Fatty s lover?  
                    Like an ongoing thing or once?

                                  JACKIE
                    That is NONE of your business!
                          (then, immediately)
                    Once!  Fine!  Are you happy now?!  
                    Once after the Hyde Park game!                                                                                    32.


                                  SEAN
                    That was a great game!  I would 
                    have slept with Fatty that night.

                                  RONNY
                          (standing up)
                    THIS SEEMS LIKE THE PERFECT TIME 
                    FOR A TOAST!  Or maybe the worst 
                    time, but let s see what happens.  
                    Raise your glasses, people!  To my 
                    sister, Jackie!  For providing the 
                    world with another McCarthy!

      Jackie scowls.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Here here.
                          (off Jackie s surprised 
                            look)
                    I don t know what  here here  
                    means, but I m gonna be here for 
                    you.  Here here for you.

                                  SEAN
                    Careful, Dad.  Wordplay.

      Jackie tears up, very grateful to her father.  

                                  JACKIE
                          (overwhelmed, crying)
                    Ronny, do some more toast!

                                  RONNY
                    Yes!  Okay, um, a big congrats to 
                    my brothers on their new jobs! 

      Sean pats Gerard s head.  Gerard slaps his hand away.

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    And to all of you, for giving me a 
                    gay bah.  Or what you think a gay 
                    bah is.  Which is maybe not this.  
                    And though I don t think there are 
                    any matches here--

                                  GROSS LIBRARIAN
                    You re no prize yourself.

                                  RONNY
                    Wow.  Okay.  All feedback is 
                    useful.  What I m trying to say 
                    though is that I really appreciate 
                    the effort.                                                                                    33.


                                  MARJORIE
                          (lying to mend fences)
                    The gay bah was actually your 
                    father's idea.  

      Ronny looks at Arthur, who refuses to lie to his son again.

                                  ARTHUR
                    It was your mutha s idea.  But it 
                    was a good one.

                                  RONNY
                          (touched by his honesty)
                    Well then...thanks to all of you.

      Everyone clinks glasses and drinks.

                                  SEAN
                    Hey, Ronny, since there are so many 
                    great things happening around here, 
                    maybe you shouldn t move out.  
                          (starts a chant)
                    Ronny!  Ronny!  Ronny!

      Marjorie, Arthur, Gerard, and Jackie join in.

                                  EVERYONE
                    Ronny!  Ronny!  Ronny!

                                  RONNY
                          (yelling over chant)
                    Again!  Not the most articulate  
                    argument!  Seriously, it s just 
                    clapping and repeating my name!
                          (after a beat, hiding how 
                            much he s enjoying it)
                    Okay!  Fine!  I ll stay a little 
                    while longer!

      The family claps and cheers.  The Irish Guy stoically tries 
      to kiss Ronny, who assures him he doesn t have to.



      Marjorie stands at the door as Ronny leaves.

                                  MARJORIE
                      Goodnight, Ronny.  You re my 
                    favorite. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

                      Goodnight, Jackie. 

      And she closes the door.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.
