
    Perry continues his.story over a gangster era flashback
    with our people in starring roles.  Dragonetti (Luthor)
    walks under a theater marquis announcing "The Jazz Singer"
    and turns the corner into an alley.

                              PERRY (V.0.)
                Dragonetti actually built this
                place.  He and a consortium of
                other high profile gangsters.  They
                hid behind a dummy corporation and
                tried to launder their gin money
                through the real estate market.
                This was before the Daily Planet
                moved in, of course.  Anyway,
                Dragonetti used this as his
                headquarters.  There was even a
                speakeasy in the basement, right
                where the cafeteria is now.

    Dragonetti goes to a nondescript door near some garbage
    cans.  He knocks, and an eye hole slides open.  The door
    opens immediately and we move into...



    Lois, Fuentes, Schumak and Blackman come out onto the         *
    roof.  They look around, confused.

                              FUENTES
                Where's the chopper?

                              SCHUMAK
                I don't know.

                              FUENTES
                Newberry!

                              BLACKMAN
                He can't even drive a car.

                              FUENTES
                Then who took it?

    Lois smiles, figuring it out.

                              LOIS
                Superman.

    Fuentes angrily pulls her back inside followed by the         *
    others.

65A BACK TO THE SCAFFOLD                                       65A 

    ... as Fuentes' finger moves toward the button, still in
    his hand. The other end of the scaffold gives out before
    he can push it and he, too, plummets to the ground.


65B SUPERMAN                                                   65B 

    catches Fuentes, grabs his wrist.  Fuentes involuntarily
    drops the device.  Lois catches it.

                              LOIS
                       (disgustedly)
                Other women catch bouquets, I catch
                bombs.

                              SUPERMAN
                       (smiling)
                That's what makes you so special,
                Lois.

                              LOIS
                       (smiling back proudly)
                Oh.

    He takes the bomb from her as we HEAR SIRENS pull up.

                              SUPERMAN
                Tell them there's one tied up in
                the west stairwell and two more on
                the roof.
                       (re bomb)
                I'll take care of this.

    He flies off as the police grab Fuentes.  Perry, Jimmy,
    Willie and Luthor come out of the main doors.

                              PERRY
                Hey!  We've got an injured man over
                here!

    Lois rushes over to Luthor's side as two paramedics lead      *
    him to an ambulance and sit him down.                         *

                              LUTHOR
                Lois?  Are you all right?

                              LOIS
                I'm fine.

                              LUTHOR
                What an experience.  At least I got
                to spend the night with you.  I
                didn't know you were that type of
                woman.
