      Muzzles of high-velocity rifles jab through.

      Then come 6 burly blokes in bullet-proof vests.

      They charge up dirty concrete steps. 

      Leading is SERGEANT COLIN BRACKLEY(mid-late 30s), wearing an

      The sirens wail, the helicopter (unseen) grows nearer.

      Arnott reaches the door of the flat - it s hanging off its 
      hinges. Something about the number doesn t look right to him, 
      which deflects him momentarily, before he plunges into the 
      flat. Through the unit of paramedics fighting vainly to save 
      Karim s life, Arnott sees Karim s widow and the baby.             "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    9.

                    Oh, my God.

        Brackleyjust shakes his head numbly.

      Arnott moves to the door and reaches for the 6 of the 56. 
      Close-up we can see the faint mark of slightly different 
      weathering above the 6 and a tiny screw hole. 

      Arnott rotates the number upright. It sits next to the 5 --

      -- 59. 

      This is Flat 59.


      ON ARNOTT:

      Arnott shakes. He looks like he ll puke. In b/g the 
        helicopters approach fast (VFX). 

        Brackleysees what Arnott has done. He turns pale like he ll 
      faint. Both men are speechless with horror as the young widow 
      cries, cradling her crying baby next to her husband as 
      paramedics declare him dead.

      The van speeds out of the estate. Brackleyand his squad sit

      Arnott trudges inside. Osborne hooks his arm and pulls him 
      into an alcove. He waves a statement in his face.

      Arnott steps out of the lift onto a high walkway. Glass 
      fronted offices surround him. Uniformed officers visible in 
      key positions suggest this is a Headquarters Building.

                      That s the ticket.

      Arnott tries to look convinced. Not entirely successfully.

                      I don t.

      Hastings doesn t tell him. He studies him.

                    The bad news, as always with a

      She laughs and shoves him in mock offence. He laughs. 

      She reaches into her purse to settle the bill.

                                    JACKIE
                    I ll call you if I get back before 
                    it s too late ...

      He beats her to paying the bill. She reacts subtly -- his 
      paying is a statement, given their respective wealth.

                                    GATES
                    Maybe we should just dash over to 
                    your place before you go ...

      From her look we get that they ve got a pretty hot sex life 
      at the moment. 

      Nadzia returns to pick up the payment.

      Then out of the window Gates sees a young woman pushing a 
      toddler in a buggy. A couple of youths leap out at her, 
      trying to steal her bag. The woman screams.

      Gates reacts.

                      Anthony Gates.

      At a formal event, guests rise from their seats in applause 
      of Gates as he takes to the stage. The Chief Constable puts a 
      medal round his neck and shakes his hand, whispering 
        congratulations. Also on stage applauding is the Mayor. 

      In the audience one man pointedly doesn t applaud -- 
      Hastings, in uniform. He observes coolly, flanked by Arnott.

      We re on Arnott, absorbing his discomfort -- deep unsettling 
      pcunease -- as Gates starts a short speech.

                                    GATES
                    Being a police officer isn t a job. 
                    It s more than a duty. It s a 
                      privilege.

      From the periphery, alone and uneasy, Arnott observes a 
      champagne reception. He watches Gates in a self-
        congratulatory huddle with the Chief Constable and characters 
      we ll meet properly later -- Chief Superintendant Hilton, 
      plus Cottan, Morton and Kapoor. They re laughing at each 
      other s quips.

      Arnott turns away, burdened already.

      We join Gates et al.

      Laughter.

      Gates s mobile phone vibrates. He glances at the caller ID in 
      his pocket --

      -- Jackie Laverty--

      -- but doesn t answer it.

                                    GATES

      Gates slips away from the crowd. His expression changes from 
      a fixed grin to slight worry as he keys his phone.          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    20.

                      I said calm down --

      Gates turns perturbed.

                    Where are they?

      She shows him the keys. His face drops.

                    I m sorry, I m sorry, I panicked.

      She sobs. Backed into a corner, he runs through the options. 
      Tense beats. Her despair works on him. He snatches the keys 
      off her and moves into the hallway. He assesses the layout of 
      the hall, the distance to the door etc.

                                    JACKIE
                    What are you ... ?



      With the keys, he makes scratches on a hallway table near the 
      door and then, from the outside, works loose the lead on a 
      little round window in the door.

                    Thank you, Tony, thank you.

      He pockets the keys. But he remains visibly alarmed by the 
      hugely dangerous course ahead.

      NIGHT 3.

      Gates lets himself in the front door of a nice family house 
      on a well-maintained new-built estate. Shoes left by the 
      front door suggest two girls under ten years old live here. 

      A big soppy dog stares up at him, half asleep in its basket.

                    Some guard dog you are.

      He creeps up the stairs. The landing is lit by a night light, 
      and a bedroom door is open, the little girls asleep in bunk 
      beds.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      She cuddles up to him and goes right back to sleep. He stares 
      at the ceiling.

      MORNING.   DAY 4.

      Fleming enters, finding a uniformed WPC, KAREN LARKIN, with

                                  ALF
                      Pleased to meet you.

                            (Sitting.)
                    First let me say how bad I feel for 
                      what s happened to you. It must 
                    have been a very frightening 
                      experience. How are you feeling?

                    It d really help us envision your 
                      experience, sir, if we could hear 
                    it at first hand.

                                  ALF
                    What? I came in today because I 
                      thought you d made some progress.

                                    FLEMING
                    I m sorry, Mr. Butterfield, unless 
                    we have hard physical evidence that 
                    leads us to an offender, it s very 
                      difficult --

                                  ALF
                    I ve been burgled three times this 
                    year already. Every time, it s 
                      someone new, who s been given the 
                    file, who wants to  empathise  all 
                    over again. 

        Distraught, Alf gets up to go. He uses a stick. Larkin 
      ignores his slow, painful movements -- Fleming doesn t.

                                    FLEMING

      Fleming s got through to him. He takes the card. He lingers

                      I processed the arrests, sir.

                    There was an opportunity here with 
                    one of the offenders to miss out 
                    the knife altogether. 

                                    FLEMING
                      I took the view they were both 
                      involved, sir.

      DC  DEEPAKKapoor (late 20s, Asian) strolls past her carrying 
      a tray of posh takeaway coffee. He enters an area divided off 
      by a glass partition signed TO-20. It s like another world -- 
      gleaming new kit, detectives in designer suits. 

      Inside are Gates, DETECTIVE SERGEANT MATTHEW  Dot  Cottan 
      (early 30s) and DETECTIVE CONSTABLE NIGEL MORTON (late 40s, 
      uses walking stick), shuffling through case files.

                      I heard they gave you more than a 
                    free breakfast. 

      Cottan gestures a hand-job/blow-job. Laughter, while Kapoor 
        distributes the coffees.

                      Cheers, mate.

      Fleming watches. Gates sees her and turns away aloofly. 
      Cottan takes the next case file off the top of the pile

      Gates wears a pensive expression as he pulls up sharply 
      alongside a line of parked cars on a busy high street. 

      Jackie jumps out of her roadster and into the passenger seat. 
      Gates pulls away quickly.

                    You didn t kill a dog. You killed a 
                    man.

                                    JACKIE
                    Oh, my God, oh, my God ...

      He momentarily softens. He reaches out and grips her hand. 
      Then returns it to the steering wheel to make a hard left.

                                    GATES
                    You go to a station today. You tell 
                    them exactly what you told me. 

                                    JACKIE
                    Tony, I can t --

                                    GATES
                    Yes you bloody can, Jackie! A man 
                    is dead. That s one problem - 
                      covering it up is a whole bigger 
                    one. You understand me?

      Gates makes another hard left, accelerating on quickly. She s 
      anguished, conflicted.

                                    GATES
                    YOU UNDERSTAND ME?          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    31.

                                    GATES
                    You tell the fewest lies possible  
                    but you say you panicked and now 
                    you want to come clean. Got it?

                                    JACKIE
                    Tony --

                                    GATES

                    Okay, Tony, okay.

      He makes a third hard left, completing a tour round the block 
      back into the high street where he picked her up.

                                    GATES
                    Don t call me, and don t bottle it -
                      - I ve put the case right where I 
                    can keep an eye on it. 

      He brakes hard alongside her roadster. She gets out and he 
      speeds on, his face a grim mask.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      Exit Kapoor.

      DETECTIVE SERGEANT LEAH Janson (early 30s) and Fleming stare 
      at the pile. Various others -- mostly civilians, mostly with 
      hang-dog appearances -- look gloomy.

      The civilian investigator -- RITA BENNETT, middle-aged, 
        overweight, jobsworth-- shuffles from her desk with a bit of 
      paper and all the vigourof a trained slug.

                                    JANSON

                      Anyway, I m out of here.

      Janson turns to look through the glass partition towards TO-
      20. Fleming follows her gaze: Cottan and Morton larking 
      about.

                                    JANSON
                      Gates s had a written warning about 
                    his team s gender balance. I m a 
                      shoe-in.

      Janson looks smug. Envy plays on Fleming s face. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      From his office, Gates watches Jackie being escorted into the 
      CID office by Rita Bennett. Jackie looks very, very nervous. 
      Which makes Gates nervous too. He struggles to keep his eyes

                    Have a seat please, Ms. Laverty.

      Jackie sits at the corner of Rita s desk while Rita takes a 
      little too long to track down Jackie s statement on her 
      computer. She hits wrong keys and gets warning bleeps.

                                    RITA

                    10.06 pmthe night before it was 
                    found abandoned ... ?

      Jackie trembles with nerves. Gates makes brief eye contact 
      with her, nervous as hell too.

                                    JACKIE
                      That s right. I returned home from 
                      a business trip around nine, but 
                    later I remembered I d left 
                      something in the car. When I went 
                    to pick up the keys, they were 
                    gone, and they d broken part of the 
                      window in my front door.

      Rita clacks the keyboards.

                                    RITA
                    They hooked the keys off the hall 
                      table. You didn t hear anything?

      Jackie hesitates. Gates s eyes are all over her.

                                    JACKIE
                    I was in a back room of the house, 
                    with music playing.           "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    34.


      Satisfied, Rita clacks her keyboard while Jackie tries to 
      maintain her composure. 

      Gates can tell there hasn t been a shock confession. He looks 
      mortified.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Arnott and Hastings stroll into reception. Straight ahead is 
      public access to a secure desk; to the right is police access 
      to a security entrance.

      Hastings  phone rings.

                                    HASTINGS
                    Sign us in, Steve, I ll just be a

                        Superintendent Hastings.

      Hastings steps back out to take the call. A fraction of a 
      second later, Fleming comes out of the police door. 

      Arnott checks her out.

                                    ARNOTT

                    Okay. 

      Fleming leads him towards the police access door.

      She tries her fob but it doesn t work first time.

                                    FLEMING
                    They said they were getting this 
                      fixed.

      She tries the fob again and this time the door releases.

      Hilton appears. Idle chatter stops; heads turn to their 
      computer screens. He crosses to Gates s office and taps on 
      the glass before stepping in.

      Gates looks very worried.

      Arnott waits behind a desk. Next to him sits Hastings. Enter 
      Gates, shown in by Fleming. 

                                    FLEMING
                    Can I get someone to bring you a 
                    tea, coffee, sir?

      Hastings and Arnott stand to shake hands with Gates.

                                    GATES
                    I m fine, thanks, Fleming.

      Arnott tries to catch Fleming s eye with a mollifying smile. 
      She pointedly ignores him and exits.

      Gates shakes hands. He sits down, smiles, adopts a friendly 
      and confident posture.

      Gates laughs along with the joke but doesn t like it.

      Arnott starts looking embarrassed and awkward.

                                    HASTINGS
                    May I start?

                    Of course, sir.

      Hasting starts the tape recorder. Gates starts looking 
      properly nervous.

      Hastings passes Gates the charge in writing.

                    Yes.

      Gates grins from ear to ear before returning to professional 
      autopilot. He takes the document.

                    Not your fault, sir.

      Gates shakes hands and exits briskly.

      Hastings gathers his materials. He glances at Arnott. Arnott 
      remains seated in the same mood of sulky embarrassment.

                      A player like Gates knows it s 
                      against regs not to declare a 
                      gratuity. So what does it tell us 
                    that Gates didn t bother to fill in

      Gates strolls along the corridor. A couple of detectives hold 
      out their hands and he gives them high/low-fives. He returns 
      to his office calmly.

      burglaries with lines like  no further information available

                    work.

      She waits expecting more from him, such as an invitation to 
      get involved, but nothing is forthcoming. So she comes right 
      out with it.

      Fleming retakes her position at CID. Janson slaps a hand down

      As soon as other officers clock them, they move out of their

      Hastings indicates some female officers, among them Janson. 
      Janson pays attention to Arnott.

      Hastings moves to the bar to order. 

      Arnott feels Janson s eyes on him. He sees her whisper 
      something to one of the other women, while looking his way, 
      and they chuckle.

      He can t work out if she fancies him or is taking the piss.

      Fleming joins Janson s group. She follows her gaze to Arnott, 
      and then she sees Hastings.

      Hastings leads Arnott onto the walkway. He watches a lift 
      ascend from the ground floor. A few uniformed officers are 
      visible in the lobby, to maintain the impression of a

      Arnott isn t so sure any more.

                    Gates cherry-picks a crime that s 
                    easy to solve, and dumps the rest. 
                    Then he invents additional charges 
                    that never appear in court but 
                    boost his clear-up rate. That s how 
                    Tony Gates s got where he is.

      Kapoor points away from the bar and Fleming follows his

      She takes one half, and the boys make a noise of being 
        underwhelmed. She takes the second, one in each fist, and the 
      boys give her due acknowledgement.

      Natalie skips away excitedly. Jools studies Gates. He puts on 
      a brave face.

      Arnott shuts it all down, scoops a few personal items into 
      his pockets, and exits.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      As Arnott comes out, Hastings is waiting for him. Arnott

                    Come with me.

      They get into the lift. Arnott is suddenly very curious. The 
      lift goes up.

      station;

      -- Edge Park -- leafy, well-to-do;



      -- Moss Heath -- run-down, high crime.

      Gates indicates a particular sink estate in Moss Heath -- the

      Gates laughs with them.

      Fleming shows a flash of concern for Arnott as she watches

      In an unmarked car, Cottan snaps a photo on a very long lens, 
      Morton at his side watching through binoculars.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      NIGHT. NIGHT 7. 

      LONG LENS PHOTO MONTAGE:

      Wesley goes up to the door of a little semi-detached house in 
      a rundown street, carrying an empty rucksack. The door opens, 
      Wesley goes in.

      Wesley comes out, rucksack full.

        A photo-click.

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:



      The surveillance photos of Wesley are on a projector screen.

                                    MORTON
                    Our old friend Wesley Duke, with a 
                    big fat rucksack full of crack 
                      cocaine. While you were all tucked 
                    up in your warm beds --

                                    GATES
                    You were tucked up with Dot.

      Laughter.

                                    MORTON
                    -- Dot and me traced the source 
                    back to this address --

      Further pictures repeat the images of Wesley at the semi; in 
      the doorway are two figures who are almost impossible to make 
      out except they re dark-skinned and wear hoodies.

                                    MORTON
                    - 161 Green Lane. Wesley s been 
                      small-time but this appears to be a 
                    new, large-scale supply he s tapped 
                    into. Next stage would be to pick 
                    up Wesley and turn him.

                                    FLEMING
                    What if he blabs? We don t want to 
                    alert the Green Lane mob to us 
                      watching them.

                                    GATES
                      I agree. Keep up the surveillance 
                    for now. Let s see who else comes 
                    and goes from this address.
                          (To Morton.)
                    Tah, Nige.

      Morton starts to turn off the visual aids.

                                    GATES
                    Leave them, Nige.

      The team disperses but Gates remains in the room, troubled, 
      pensive. He keys the remote control and goes back to the only 
      image that shows the shadowy figures in the doorway of the 
      semi. Fleming is last to exit.

                                    GATES
                    Oh, Fleming, I ll talk to the Fifth 
                    Floor about formally approving your 
                      transfer to TO-20          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    62.


                                    FLEMING
                      Thanks, sir. I won t let you down.

      Exit Fleming. Gates glances at the photos again, intrigued by 
      these new kids on the block.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Crime scene tape cordons off the house. A crowd of scraggy 
      locals -- adults, teenagers and kids - stand around gawping. 
      Forensic Scene Investigators comb the scene. Gates arrives, 
        immediately addressing a uniformed PC.          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    63.


                                    GATES
                    Move the pond life further away and 
                      they ll soon go back to watching 
                      Jeremy Kyle. And make the kids go 
                    to school, the ones who aren t 
                      excluded.

      Gates slips covers over his shoes and then walks in through 
      the front door of No. 161.

      In the hallway, well back from the living room, are Morton, 
      Cottan and Fleming, covers over their clothes. 

                                    MORTON
                      Morning, boss.

      Gates doesn t answer, peers into the living room grimly -- 
      two dead Asian men, tied to chairs, dead from multiple stab 
      wounds. There s a lot of blood. Both men have had all their 
      fingers cut off, which lie on the carpet round them, being 
      bagged one by one by FSI sin white suits.

      Cottan looks very, very sheepish.

                                    COTTAN
                    Tone, I don t know what to say, 
                    mate ...

                                    GATES
                      Later, Dot, alright.

      Cottan nods, hangs his head sheepishly.

                                    FLEMING
                    From the blood spatter both men 
                    were alive when the fingers were 
                      amputated. Looks like whoever 
                      killed them wanted to know 
                      something, and didn t find out.

                                    GATES
                    The finger amputations are clean. 
                    Each one done with a single stroke. 
                    Most likely with a bolt-cutter. 
                    Dot, go through the files back at 
                    the station, see if there s a 
                      similar M.O. hereor in another 
                      force s case history. 

                                    COTTAN
                    OK.

                    Aye, aye, skipper.

                                    GATES
                      Fleming, I want you to run door-to-
                    door. 

      Exit Gates and Fleming.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Wearing a grave expression, Fleming heads towards an 
      interview room. Janson  greets  her. 

                                    JANSON
                    What goes around comes around.

      Janson exits with a sneer. Fleming goes in. Alf Butterfield 
      is inside, being comforted by Larkin. Alf has a black eye and 
      a cut lip.

                                  ALF
                    This time I was home when they 
                    broke in.

                                    FLEMING
                    Mr. Butterfield, I m very sorry --

      Enter Hilton, at the door, beckoning Fleming out. They talk 
      in the corridor, in whispers.

                                    HILTON
                    He s going to make a complaint!

                                    FLEMING
                    Sir, with respect, you told me to 
                    put the case on the back-burner.

                                    HILTON
                      I told you to prioritize. 

      Butter wouldn t melt in Hilton s mouth. He exits. Fleming 
      looks very bitter.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Arnott is still at it, bleary eyed, empty coffee cups strewn 
      round his desk. He s filled a dozen pages of the note pad. 
      He s on case number 15, a case of ARMED ROBBERY.

      Arnott makes notes about the ladderinghere: additional

      Rita clicks open the image for Gates. Gates looks very 
      uneasy.

                    was an accountant for Laverty

      Rita complies, happy to do so and not one bit suspicious. As 
      soon as Rita reaches the kitchen, Gates highlights the 
      section relating to GurjitPatel.

      The enormous dilemma plays on Gates s face. He looks like his 
      world is about to cave in.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      Arnott is curious and a little puzzled.
