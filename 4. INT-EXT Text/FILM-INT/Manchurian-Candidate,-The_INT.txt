A topographical MAP glows on the LCD screen of a laptop
portable, faintly lighting the faces of CAPT. BEN MARCO and
his big, gentle, French guide, LAURENT TOKAR.
MARCO
(pointing)
... this way --?
LAURENT
Yes, well -- I see the Captain enjoys the
road less travelled.
Marco is seemingly unflappable, completely engaged by life.
MARCO
The Captain enjoys not dragging his ass
down the highway for every Tom, Dick and
Qadhafi to take a whack at.
Laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach.

Well. Of course it is very bad, here.

Hired an Iraqi firm, in fact, who, now,

MARCO

Sgt. Shaw!
No response.
And we RUSH TOWARD: A SOLDIER IN A LAWN CHAIR, face lifted
to the heavens, sitting directly between the two armored
vehicles. This is SGT. RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW, late
twenties, haunted and aloof.
MARCO
(suddenly behind him)
Sergeant.
RAYMOND
Sir.
MARCO
Rolling in two minutes.
RAYMOND
Yes sir.
Beat.
MARCO
Everything okay?

RAYMOND
Yes, Captain. Everything's fine.
Here.

I'll "rally" the troops.

MUSIC blares around eight soldiers, including wiseguy PFC.
ED MAVOLE, crowded into space designed for four --
MAVOLE
Yo Melvin. You gonna play that hand, or
hatch it?
-- CPL. AL MELVIN grunts, then they all look up, almost in
unison, at Raymond when he swings open the back door. PFC.
BOBBY BAKER, a slender man, barely eighteen, a driver,
ejects a CD from the onboard stereo. Silence.
RAYMOND
We're moving out.

He shuts the door again.

Marco, bug-like in night goggles, drives the infamous
Highway of Death -- a macabre landscape of abandoned cars,
trucks, minivans, shopping baskets, broken wooden pushcarts
and festering fires; pots and pans and clothes and personal
belongings are scattered out into the desert on either side
of the road. Laurent rides shotgun. Raymond is in the
back, facing forward, rifle at ease.
RAYMOND
Captain?
MARCO
Sergeant?
RAYMOND
Why don't I ever ride in the Bradley with
the other enlisted personnel?

MARCO
(hesitates)
Maybe I enjoy your company, Sergeant.
RAYMOND
Sir, I don't want to be singled out for
special treatment because of my mother's
position --
MARCO
Too late for that, Shaw. As a charter
member of the Lucky Sperm Club your
benefits include unlimited suck-up from
High-ranking Officers hoping to curry
Congressional favor for their future
career moves. But. If you want to ride
in the Bradley, hey, I got no objections.
RAYMOND
(worried)
Trust me, sir, I don't wish to ride in
the Bradley with the others, I'm just ...
(beat)
The men don't care for me very much.
MARCO
No, they don't. But. On the plus side,
you don't really like them, either.
RAYMOND
That's absolutely correct, Captain.
MARCO
So.
See?
It, you know.
Balances out.

Marco follows Laurent's gaze out the side window --

IN THE MIRROR - ON THE ROAD BEHIND THEM:

Two dark trucks converge suddenly out of the darkness, on
either side of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle --
They SLAM together in a pincer-wedge just in front of it,
and the Bradley CRASHES into them -- climbs over them, off-
balance, and SMASHES DOWN onto the roof of one of the trucks
and is effectively low-bridged -- tracks spinning, unable to
move -- DARK FIGURES scurry from the trucks.
12
THE HUMMER -- skids around in a tight 180, stops, facing
12
back at the helpless Bradley. Automatic weapons fire in
bursts, bright, and ricochet harmlessly away --
IN THE HUMMER -- MARCO scrambles up out of his seat, pops
the roof hatch and screams at Raymond --
MARCO
Take the wheel, Sergeant!

WASHINGTON D.C., NOW
A full chicken buffet table, banners, flags, and over one
hundred SCOUTS, LEADERS and DADS, all looking somewhat
attentively up at the guest speaker, U.S. Army Major Ben
Marco.
MARCO
Like Edmonds in Korea, Holderman in Viet

Congressional Medal of Honor. I signed
the recommendation myself.
A hand shoots up.

He blinks.
MARCO

concussion -- lost focus -- Sgt. Shaw
took command --
A disheveled man comes into the back of the room noisily,
as:
SCOUT DAD
Did your unit sustain any casualties?
MARCO
Yes.
Two. Two of my people were killed.
Silence. No more questions. The disheveled man (MELVIN)
coughs. Marco pointedly ignores him.
MARCO
The Medal of Honor is the highest award
to which any soldier can aspire. From
the jungles of Iwo Jima to the desert of
Kuwait, what these brave men I've talked
about today did will never be forgotten.
Since 1917, only 827 medals have been
given to a total of more than 30 million
Americans in arms. Only three have been
awarded in the last 40 years. Who knows?
Maybe someday one of you fine boys will
earn one yourself in defense of this
great nation.
A SCOUTMASTER, thin, bearded, stands up:
SCOUTMASTER
Major Marco, on behalf of Troops 484 and
488 -- just like to thank you, for coming
to talk to us, about the Medal of Honor,
and your interesting experiences in the
Armed Services.
8/18/03

MARCO
Thanks for listening. My family has
claimed the Army as a trade ever since a
young gunnery officer who grew up with
Hernando De Soto left Spain for a look at
the upper Mississippi.
(beat)
My life is in service to my country.
MELVIN
You ever wish it'd been you?
MARCO
Excuse me?
MELVIN
Won the medal. Been the hero.
Something causes Marco to hesitate.
Then, as if he'd
rehearsed it:
MARCO
No, I'm just proud to have been there.
He sits down.
Spattering of polite applause.

The luncheon is breaking up. A couple of scouts chase each
other through the clusters of men. Marco's leaving. Men
stop him to shake his hand and thank him for coming.
MELVIN
Major Marco.
Marco turns, stares blankly into the eyes of the bedraggled-
looking man, who half-salutes.
MELVIN
It's Al Melvin, Sir. Corporal Melvin.
From your unit. Desert Storm.
Marco stares hard. Melvin looks like a homeless guy, his
clothes rumpled, his fingernails stained and broken, his
eyes wild with fatigue and paranoia.
MARCO
Melvin.
Jesus -- how are you --
MELVIN
(intense)
I have these dreams, Major.
MARCO
Dreams.
8/18/03

MELVIN
Yeah. Kuwait. You and me. Mavole, and
Baker. Raymond Shaw.
(beat)
See, I remember it happened the way you
just said. And then I don't.
MARCO
Well, we had a pretty rough time over
there, Al, it was hairy, and -- it was a
long time ago, now. Memories shift.
MELVIN
Do you have dreams, sir?
MARCO
Everybody has dreams, Corporal --
MELVIN
Not these.
Beat.
Marco stares at him.
MARCO
No I don't.
Melvin's face falls, disappointed. Fumbling in his clothes,
he finds a SPIRAL NOTEBOOK, dog-eared, and fat with
newspaper clippings -- tries to press it into Marco's hands.
MELVIN
It's bad, sir. It's making me crazy. I
write it down, every night, after I wake
up, I try to get it all -- it doesn't
always go together -- all of what I can
remember, and --
MARCO
(gentle)
-- Al, you know, maybe you should be
going to the VA and talking to a doctor,
I mean if these dreams are really --
MELVIN
-- I've been to doctors!
The notebook DROPS BETWEEN THEM, and PAGES SCATTER on the
floor. Both men go down to collect them --
MELVIN
I'm so stuck, sir. I mean -- I remember
Shaw saving us, but it does not make
sense -- it should have been you. And
Shaw, he --
8/18/03

MARCO
Well, that's -- it's over and done.
We've got to move on --
-- Marco rocks back on his heels as he stares down at a
SKETCHY PORTRAIT OF AN ARABIC WOMAN whose face is covered
with intricate designs -- Marco stares curiously, as if he
recognizes her --
MELVIN
I can't get my hand around it. I thought
maybe, if you had the dreams ...
MARCO
(shaken)
You need money --?
MELVIN
No.
No sir.
Self-conscious (people are staring) Melvin shoves the
notebook back inside his jacket.
MARCO
-- here --
Marco already digging for a crumpled twenty.
Melvin waves
it off, backing away, suddenly pissed.
MELVIN
I don't need your money.
MARCO
Okay.
Okay. Well, look, Al, I gotta --
MELVIN
Go.
MARCO
-- run, yeah. But.
(awkward)
It was great seeing you.
And good luck
to you.
Melvin just scowls sadly at Marco. Flash of glass, a door
opens and closes, and Marco is gone.

Marco comes up the stairs with his groceries. An ELDERLY
WOMAN sticks her head out from her apartment door:
WOMAN

Marco stops, looks at her blankly.
WOMAN
From the landing. Every week it gets
longer. I'm worried about you.
He takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands
them to her.
MARCO
From the landing. Every week it gets

He takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands
them to her.
MARCO
None of these involve slave traders or
sheiks, Abby. I checked.

What do I owe you?
MARCO

A smile.
She does.

He enters, and a visible exhaustion overtakes him.

ROVING REPORTER

events of Bloody Friday, with the war on
terror marching into yet another year, no
end in sight --
MARCO
Yawns -- his eyelids flutter -- he shudders awake, digs in
his grocery bag for the No Doz and shakes out half a dozen.
Which he swallows dry.
ROVING REPORTER
-- the American people are looking for a
new agenda -- but because this party
remains deeply divided on so many issues,
the choice of a vice presidential nominee
may be the key unifying factor for the
delegates of this convention in much the
way Johnson helped Kennedy in 1960 ...
Then he's up on his feet, moving to the kitchen through the
small, cramped space overflowing with books, unopened boxes
from Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble.

Marco sits at a clearing on the tiny kitchen table, eating

INSTANT NOODLES in the cupboard.
ON THE TELEVISION
News coverage, the crowded floor of a political convention.
A poised, silvery, avuncular man, SENATOR THOMAS JORDAN
(according to the title on the screen) on the podium:
JORDAN
-- no, the real danger is from suspending
civil liberties, gutting the Bill of
Rights, allowing our fear to destroy our
democratic ideals --

The same speech continues, largely ignored by Congressman
RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW. Still intense and moody, the new
8/18/03

Raymond Shaw's suit is expensive and crisp, his hair
perfect. He's playing solitaire. And winning.
RAYMOND
(murmurs)
... I am not a professional politician.
I am not a professional politician ...
TV43
JORDAN (T.V.)
TV43
-- because once we start overturning our
constitutional protections, our enemies
have won.
RAYMOND
... I am ... a professional politician.
Not.
KNOCKING on his door -- it opens, and Secret Service AGENT
EVAN ANDERSON removes his key while SEN. ELEANOR SHAW,
pretty and ageless, sweeps in -- closing the door on her
aide (GILLESPIE) --
ELLIE
Raymond? Darling, what were you going to
do, make me stand out there like room
service?
-- soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone --
she kisses her son on the lips, straightens his collar, his
tie, lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for a
little too long, and never stops talking:
ELLIE
I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman, your
'wrangler' -- helpful Ms. Freeman -- said
you were up here practicing your speech.
Honestly, I don't understand why you
insist upon isolating yourself, people
adore you, Raymond, they crave your
company and yet here you are, holed up,
as if you were some kind of emotionally
challenged individual like your father
instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw, a
handsome, intelligent, people-loving war
hero with a great deal to offer to his
party and his country.
RAYMOND
No.
ELLIE
No what? Baby, I haven't even asked you
a question. Your hair is too flat. And
that tie. The tie is wrong.
8/18/03
16.
RAYMOND
No to the question you're going to ask.
No to all the questions you pretend to
want to ask --
ELLIE
(the tie)
Something a little less busy.
RAYMOND
-- and no you may not engage in your
usual back-door political thuggery to
shovel me onto the presidential ticket.
ELLIE
Oh. You're not interested? I thought
you were. Did I miss my cue?
RAYMOND
Of course I'm interested -- I wouldn't be
here if I wasn't -- but not if it means
attacking the reputation of a statesman
like Thomas Jordan, which I'm sure was
your plan. Let democracy run its course,
mother. Let the people decide.
Now Ellie stares at him, mouth agape.
RAYMOND
What.
ELLIE
I'm sorry, for a second there I thought
it was your father speaking -- that
dreaded Shaw blood rising -- and the
stink of defeat made me nauseous.
RAYMOND
Mother --
ELLIE
And excuse me, when have I ever attacked
the honorable Mr. Jordan, despite the
shameful way his daughter misled you that
summer at the shore.
RAYMOND
Mother, you chased her away --
ELLIE
If that's how you want to remember it.
RAYMOND
-- you ruined everything.
8/18/03
17.
ELLIE
Honey, you're oversimplifying things
somewhat -- but, yes, okay -- I promise,
promise I will stay out of it. You have
my word.
Raymond stares at her.
ELLIE
After all, you're young and you have
plenty of party conventions ahead of you
in which to discover, as your father did,
that democracy is an elusive and
imperfect science, and the meek do not
happily inherit the earth, but simply get
eaten by the alpha dogs, chewed up,
digested and deposited on the carefully
mown parkways of American politics.
Raymond rolls his eyes.
She ruffles his hair again, heads
into the bedroom.
ELLIE (O.S.)
One day, you will, I'm sure, tearfully
memorialize me in your acceptance speech.
Don't you have a different tie in here?
Your grandfather always let me pick his
ties.
Raymond smooths his hair back down.
RAYMOND
I'm wearing the one I have on.
No response.

(he seems to want to say
more, but doesn't)
I've been honored to serve my two terms
in Congress. But I also grew up on the
Hill. I've seen how the game is played
by professionals --
Marco reaches for his steaming cup of coffee, his eyes never
leaving the screen -- he just doesn't get this at all --

Ellie in the f.g., intently watching a monitor while, in the
deep b.g., slightly out of focus, we can SEE Raymond
speaking, and his convention audience beyond ...

-- how deals are struck, committees
bullied, agendas bought and sold -- and,
with apologies to my mother, I wish to

DELEGATES, HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND members and a complete

ELLIE

CONGRESSMAN HEALY

that was unusually generous of me.
She pushes through a door, and into --
48

Raymond's speech plays, low, on a television, and half a
dozen DELEGATES and POWER PLAYERS with "Arthur For
President" buttons grimly watch Ellie breeze in. Party
Chairman VAUGHN UTLY anticipates her:
UTLY
The decision is final, Senator. Tom
Jordan is on the ticket. We don't need
your blessing, but we'd like it.
ELLIE
(smiling:)
Before we get started, I'm dying to know:
which genius here hatched the scheme of
pairing a Sound Bite from Nebraska with a
relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers
off our busses is unconstitutional?
UTLY
All the research indicates that an Arthur-
Jordan ticket sits quite well with the
American public and --
ELLIE
'Sits quite well' translates into how
many votes?
SENATOR WELLS
Your son is largely unknown outside of
New York. His public service, his
Congressional record, while commendable,
is --
ELLIE
My son is a war hero.
CONGRESSMAN FLORES
(cheerful)
Governor Arthur has agreed to consider
Raymond for a cabinet post.
A cold silence.
Ellie stands --
8/18/03

ELLIE
We didn't come here to have a discussion.
UTLY
ELLIE
Senator --
(to her posse)
Did we come here to have a
discussion?
SENATOR WELLS
Ellie, you don't have the votes to block
this, or even push the nomination to a
second ballot.
ELLIE
(ignores him)
Even running against this cut-and-fold
vice president, with his party's record
of abysmal failure at home and abroad,
Arthur is still unelectable without help.
(cold, hard logic:)
Consider. The Governor is a corn-belt
candidate who -- scratch and sniff --
looks and smells alot like the kind of
liberal-labor-intellectual Dukakis was,
but without, thank God, the helmet.
(beat)
Assume our intrepid Arthur can carry the
Northeast, plus his home ground, and
California. We're still dead in the
South, and Southwest, where they win by
landslides. The mid-central is a toss-
up. Tom Jordan actually becomes a
liability in Florida because of his
Castro-appeasement profile, and in the
Carolinas, where he fumbles the military
vote over his "terrorism isn't a war it's
a social disease" nonsense.
The room is surreally silent. Ellie spins and moves like a
televangelist, preaching to the frightened faithful.
ELLIE
You know this. Your own polls and
surveys back me up.
(beat)
You're counting on Jordan to help you get
the black vote, women, college kids -- my
gut instinct says he won't -- and Arthur
holding the center -- where he's soft at
best. And who's to say the President
won't throw troops into another third-
world skirmish, pushing his sidekick's
approval ratings up into the eighties
again, and the campaign off the front
pages?
8/18/03
21.
UTLY
We're confident this is a winning ticket,
Ellie.
ELLIE
What's your margin of error? Five
points? Three?
(beat)
I can swing that, and you know it. I can
swing seven away from you -- more than
enough to split the party and --
SENATOR WELLS
(over her)
-- and deny us the White House for four
more years? No. Not even you would do
that, Senator. You're bluffing.
Ellie stares at them. OUTSIDE, SUDDENLY: the marching band
begins playing "It's a Grand Old Flag," and hurries out onto
the ROARING convention floor ...
ELLIE
America is facing the greatest test of
its history, gentlemen. Not just from
terrorist organizations both outside and
within our borders, but from covert
alliances of disaffected nations so
terrified of winding up on our shit list
they believe the only way to protect
themselves is to hit us with everything
they can find before we get around to
them. Am I the only one in this room
paying attention to the NSA reports? We
are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on
our own soil, while our policies remain
shackled by Jordan-style One Worlders who
insist that human beings are essentially
Good ... and that Power is something
shameful, and Evil.
(then)
Make no mistake, the people of this great
country are frightened. They know what's
coming. They can feel it. And we can
shovel them the same old shit and call it
sugar, or arm them, with a young,
vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero
with heart -- forged by enemy fire, in
the desert, in the dark, when American
lives hung in the balance.

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN

fiercely heat and water tolerant --
IMPRESSIONS of soldiers -- MEMBERS of Marco's squad -- flak
jackets and BDUs, rifles at ease, some squatting, some
leaning against the wall ... Cpl. Al Melvin preternaturally
engrossed in the presentation ...
We hear a SANDSTORM raging outside, causing LONG DRAPERIES
to FLUTTER and POP! like sails ... STRONG IMPRESSIONS of
PFCs ED MAVOLE and BOBBY BAKER ...
MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
-- yet -- note the complexity of the
frontal lobe -- nevertheless retaining a
sweet, juicy plumpness reminiscent of the
finest English Beefsteak or Italian Plum.
IMPRESSIONS of the American Flag. IMPRESSIONS of SGT.
RAYMOND SHAW -- he waits for the mysterious woman like an
obedient schoolboy, dutifully holding his SERVICE REVOLVER
in his hand.
MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
Those of you with ties to the
Intelligence community may recall the
CIA's misguided MK-ULTRA program, the
KGB's Novichok research, and similar half-
assed ventures in Great Britain and China
-- under the lay term of 'mind control.'

Street-corner schizophrenics with tin
foil on their heads offer sad proof of

MARCO -- is here, too -- his head wrapped in a bandage, he's
wearing hospital greens. WIRES AND TUBES are rigged to his
head, chest, arms and legs like some HIGH-TECH MARIONETTE --
-- all coiling up into the shadows of the high ceiling, into
thicker cables and tubes beneath which robotic BRACKET ARMS
adjust, whirring softly, with his every movement ... he's
drugged to the gills, jerking with spasms as low voltage
electricity courses through his brain ...
... and the women's shrill zaghareet PEAKS --
NOYLE (O.S.)
Captain Marco --
DR. ATTICUS NOYLE
the mysterious Arabic woman has become the sleek, Caucasian
scientist, ATTICUS NOYLE, whose oddly accented English is
flawless:
NOYLE
-- when you're rescued and returned with
your patrol to command headquarters, what
will be among the first duties you will
undertake?

ON MARCO all rigged up with his wires --

MARCO
I'll recommend Sergeant Shaw for the
Medal of Honor, ma'am. He saved our
lives, terminated the enemy and led us
across the desert to safety.
Now the dreamscape visuals seem REAR-PROJECTED on luminous,
rippling white fabric ... the Bedouin people, tomato/brain
images, the mystery woman, appear as TWO-DIMENSIONAL FILMED
IMAGES, flickering across draperies ...
NOYLE
Yes. Brilliant.
But there were
casualties?
MARCO
There are always casualties, ma'am.
... the DREAM SOUNDS (wind, fabric, women chanting) emanate
from audio speakers, the sandstorm's wind caused by huge,
moveable FANS ...
... IMPRESSION of an OLD MAN shaking a percussive gourd,
mesmerizing ...

tubes and wires ... Laurent glides behind them -- lab coat,
SURGICAL GLOVES on his hands ...

A collection of remote cameras on scaffolding and tripods
BUZZ and WHIR as they swivel to follow him.
NOYLE
Here, then, are ten subject soldiers in a
clinically-induced functional fugue
state. Hyperdelusional that they've been
bivouacked in a small caravansary to wait
out a sandstorm.
Marco blinks: sees the mysterious Arabic woman dressed in
Noyle's simple suit.
MYSTERIOUS WOMAN

A simple Pavlovian parlor trick.
SNAPPING of fabric, the wind gets louder.

Our Candidate's course of treatment will,
of course, involve considerably more
sophisticated intervention over a

stable mechanism is irrevocably in place.
We employ a kind of neurocellular

Raymond's wires and tubes float with him as he circles,
pleasantly exchanging greetings with Marco --
RAYMOND

MARCO

NOYLE
Raymond.
Suffocate Private Mavole.
IMPRESSION of Raymond thrusting a plastic bag over Mavole's
head --
MAVOLE
Whoawhoa -- wait -- wait a sec --
-- Raymond's hands twist it TIGHTLY -- Mavole's limbs in
turmoil, hands fluttering, his SHROUDED FACE suffocating in
the translucent fog of the plastic bag --
PFC. BOBBY BAKER -- intent upon Raymond's killing of Mavole,
gaze unwavering, untroubled -- SOUND of the zaghareet,
peaking --
NOYLE (O.S.)
And at the instant he completes this, or
any task, Raymond has already forgotten
that he has ever been involved in it.
RAYMOND SHAW -- all business -- focused and purposeful --
twists the bag even tighter -- the plastic bag steaming --
tubes break, spit liquid, blood -- wires SPARK -- while
Noyle floats through the b.g., a blur --

The meds make me ... spongy.

I'm not sharp --
LT. COL. HOWARD
The meds help you sleep.
MARCO
When I sleep, I dream.
I don't want to
dream, sir.
LT. COL. HOWARD
You're off your meds, sleep-deprived, you
have an unexpected encounter with a
member of your Gulf War recon team, Al
Melvin, who mentions some dreams he's
been having --
MARCO
Dreams like mine.
LT. COL. HOWARD
(ignores)
-- and suddenly your own bad dreams come
charging back. Made worse by your
chronic fear of them. Add in all the
recent campaign news about Congressman
Shaw, which is obviously rekindling your
feelings of guilt and jealousy --
MARCO
-- I'm not jealous of Raymond Shaw, sir.
LT. COL. HOWARD
Okay. How did you feel when you heard
the news from the convention?
Marco shrugs.
8/18/03

LT. COL. HOWARD
A shrug isn't a feeling.
MARCO
I felt ... fine.
No big deal.
LT. COL. HOWARD
Fine.
MARCO
Yes.

Glad for him. He deserves it. Raymond
Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest,
warmest --
MARCO
LT. COL. HOWARD

Half a beat --
LT. COL. HOWARD
You're fucking with me, Major.
MARCO
No sir.
I wouldn't do that, sir.
LT. COL. HOWARD
What other conclusion can I draw?
Marco says nothing.
Holding back what he's thinking.
LT. COL. HOWARD
Look, we've been over this a million
times. Until you forgive yourself for
what happened that night in Kuwait, the
loss of your men -- for what you did, for
what you didn't do ...
No reaction from Marco.
The Lt. Colonel sighs.
LT. COL. HOWARD
How's Public Affairs?
MARCO
It sucks, sir. I want to get back to
Intelligence.
LT. COL. HOWARD
Then for God's sake, Ben, go back on your
meds. And stay on them, this time. Get

Festive champagne brunch. Lush indoor foliage. The Capitol
Dome visible in the b.g. Huge, graphic banners declaim the
campaign slogan: SECURE TOMORROW and the ticket: ARTHUR-

An elegant ALL-WOMAN HARP ORCHESTRA plays new-age patriotic
music, and a thick crowd of WEALTHY PARTY INNER CIRCLE
members jostle between elegant food stations, or cue up for
thirty seconds with presidential-hopeful Robert Arthur.
MOVING WITH - MARCO

stars gleaming on their shoulders. Marco's eyes scan the

GENERAL SLOAN
No offense, Major, but it chaps my ass we
gotta have a babysitter.
MARCO
Sir, I'm just here to keep you from
getting into fist-fights with the Navy
guys.
The old generals laugh, appreciate this.
Marco stops --
eureka -- he's found his target:
MARCO'S P.O.V. - ACROSS THE HUGE ROOM - RAYMOND
holding side-show vice-presidential court for some enamored
young women and their banker husbands. SECRET SERVICE
agents, including his everpresent Anderson, maintaining a
careful perimeter.

Right behind you, sirs.
Whereupon
SENATOR ELEANOR SHAW

troops, sacrificed on behalf of a
disastrous foreign policy which has only
served to galvanize our enemies --
ELLIE
MARCO
Excuse us please --
Whoa --
FOR AN INSTANT Ellie and Marco lock eyes -- then the crowd

They oughta put up a crossing guard.
GENERAL SLOAN
Or rig her with an air horn.

JORDAN) near the entrance.
RAYMOND

That everybody matters. Not just the
people at this party -- no offense -- but
the people who can't afford to be here.
ELLIE

ELLIE
I devour everything in my path, darling,

...to join a lively group of corporate heavyweights. DAVID
DONOVAN is a man possessed of a commanding presence,
radiating charm, brilliance and stealth. J.B. (JAY)
JOHNSTON is younger than the others, a three-sport letterman
who graduated with distinction from Princeton and happily
works until there's no one left in the office to give
instructions to. MARK WHITING is gracious and warm.
ELLIE
Hello Mark.
Ellie greets Whiting with a fondness she reserves for old
friends -- as a former Tyler Prentiss protg, he now stands
comfortably at the fertile crossroads where big industry
meets big government, and profits soar.
WHITING
Eleanor! Congratulations, Raymond. Your
grandad would be so goddamn proud of you.
RAYMOND
Nice to see you Mark.
Thanks.
The following flows, overlapping, easy:
ELLIE
-- Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston, from
Manchurian Global --
RAYMOND
Yes, hi --
ELLIE
-- and David Donovan, their Managing
Director.
RAYMOND
-- and co-chair of the U.S. International
Policy Caucus.
DONOVAN

chuckle appreciatively.

Ellie glides off, unfazed.
The men banter on:
RAYMOND

WHITING
Good, Raymond. Business is good.
JOHNSTON
Could always be better.
RAYMOND
Careful. Any better, you'll be a

DONOVAN
There's the challenge. Maximizing the
market share and potential of a company.
WHITING
Or a country.
Off their shared, collegial laughter --
ACROSS THE ROOM - MARCO - MONETS LATER
watches Raymond take his leave from the Manchurian Global
guys -- while, at the bar, the generals have established
their beachhead of Bloody Marys with a couple of younger men
in NAVY WHITES:
REAR ADMIRAL GLICK
Every great civilization has been
anchored by a great Navy.
GENERAL SLOAN
Bullshit. You guys are sea chum, ripe

Marco laughs deliberately, trying to diffuse the tension.
MARCO

If you can't behave yourselves, Generals,
we're gonna spend the rest of the day

It's Major, and --
(as if it surprises
him:)
I need to talk to you.
But he keeps walking --
MARCO
-- okay.
-- Marco frowns, watches Raymond weave through the crowd
towards Jocie, at the entrance. Marco follows, passing:
ELLIE AND JORDAN
locked in fierce, low battle, off to one side, voices hard,
rising out of the din:
JORDAN

bid so that --
ELLIE

JORDAN

Tom, please, just because the party felt
a younger, more dynamic man could help

you to single me out and --
JORDAN
You know, I have such contempt for you,
Eleanor, that when I think of you, I
actually fear for this country. Raymond
is nothing. A riddle. A wild card at
worst. But you, you are the smiler who
wraps her dagger in the cloak of the flag
and waits for her chance to strike.

notes --
MARCO
I don't know, sir.
(cautious, now)
It isn't so much what he said, or didn't
say -- but his demeanor, his attitude.
Sir, I overheard an exchange he --
COLONEL GARRET
(talks over this)
I think you hoped Congressman Shaw would
say, "yes, Major, I've had those same
dreams. Tomatoes and sandstorms. You're
not nuts, there's some crazy shit going
down here."
Marco says nothing.
COLONEL GARRET
Major, we've been down this road with you
before, yes?
MARCO
No, sir, not this road, sir. But I hear
what you're saying, and I want to do this
through the proper channels.
LT. COL. HOWARD
Are you back on your meds?
MARCO
Lt. Colonel Howard -- with respect --
I've had a dozen years of experts telling
me I've got Gulf War Syndrome, or a
stress disorder. Twelve years being a
good soldier, denying what every nerve
ending in my body tells me is more real
than not. One dream, over and over. Not
variations on a dream, the same one,
night after night after night --
LT. COL. HOWARD
-- Your guilt and your jealousy require
you to construct this ... elaborate
fiction, so that you --

MARCO
LT. COL. HOWARD
No --
-- can avoid the truth.
MARCO
-- No sir. Something happened to us, in
the desert, ten years ago. Not what we
thought it was. And it happened on my
watch.
Beat.
COLONEL GARRET
Have you contacted any other members of
the unit besides Shaw and Melvin? Asked
them about the dreams?
MARCO
(from notes he's made)
Owens died of cancer in '97. Villalobos,
a car crash. Atkins committed suicide.
Jamison was at the Pentagon, 9-11, body
never recovered. Wilson I'm still trying
to track down.
Garret and Howard trade looks.
MARCO
Sir, I know I can't ask you to talk to
Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin,
it's a phone call, a quick q&a; -- look at
his notebooks, hear what he's been
dreaming -- and either he will support
the credibility of what I'm saying, or he
won't. And I'll shut up.
COLONEL GARRET
And what is it you are saying, exactly,
Major? That you misrepresented --
falsified -- what happened In Kuwait?
About the Medal of Honor? In effect,
committed perjury.
MARCO
If you just talk to Melvin --
COLONEL GARRET
(ignores)
-- No, no, I'm sorry -- you're saying an
entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was
hypnotized into believing that Raymond
Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. And
somehow you're the only one who knows the
truth.
Silence.
Marco looks down at his hands.
8/18/03

COLONEL GARRET
Major Marco. You will stay clear of
Congressman Shaw.
MARCO
Yes sir.
LT. COL. HOWARD
And you will resume your meds, Major.
That is an order.
MARCO
Yes sir.
Beat.
Marco stands up, to leave, but --
COLONEL GARRET
Major, do you ever take a step back and
consider why you've remained at rank for
all these years? Missed Bosnia,
Afghanistan, Iraqi Freedom. While men of
lesser promise and inferior talent have
enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and
moved beyond you?
MARCO

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RAYMOND'S ROOM, with Anderson sitting the
night watch, reading.
The man gestures Raymond through the closet passageway --

-- where Raymond is met by TECHNICIANS in sterile gear,
surgical gloves.
He's entered some kind of portable, surreal operating
theater, filled with monitoring device and computers ... a
one-way video-conference camera is aimed at a big
examination chair in one corner, surrounded by I.V. racks
and more techno-medical equipment.
The man who is obviously in charge here, starts a digital

moves into place -- and then a long, tiny drill bit WHIRS
DOWN through STERILE LATEX stretched very tight across
Raymond's head --
-- and plunges precisely and effortlessly through Raymond's
skull, then STOPS -- he has no reaction, feels nothing --
LCD screens -- show a VIRTUAL MAP OF RAYMOND'S BRAIN, in a
full range of primary colors -- sections morphing as
thoughts and memories race through his mind, as
MINISCULE, INTERWOVEN WIRES -- are threaded down through the
HOLLOW core of the surgical drill, deep into Raymond's
brain. Noyle plays to one of the cameras:

Marco sits at a window, eyes closed, head pressed to the

sitting down across from him.
Smiling.
LAURENT

Is this seat taken?

Marco opens his eyes -- head pressed to a window, the world
a blur beyond him -- SEES:
Nothing. An empty seat opposite him. Laurent was a dream.
Marco looks around, self-conscious, and --
THROUGH THE SEATS - A WOMAN'S FACE
staring back at him. Not enough to tell much more than
she's pretty. Marco looks away, out the window. Then back.
She's gone. Another dream?
WOMAN'S VOICE (ROSIE)
Maryland's a beautiful state.
Marco jumps -- looks. The pretty woman is sitting down
opposite him, folding and pushing aside a newspaper with the
headline: WHITE HOUSE INSISTS WAR ON TERROR IS STILL
WINNABLE. COST OF PERUVIAN CAMPAIGN HITS $100 BILLION.
8/18/03

Below the fold: ANGRY MOB KILLS MUSLIM STUDENT AT YALE.
MARCO
This is Delaware.
ROSIE
I know. But, Maryland, it's a beautiful
state anyway.
He's staring at her, trying to figure out --
ROSIE
Paper or plastic.
MARCO
What?
ROSIE
From the grocery store. You were
wondering where, we, you know -- and
right at the check-out stand, "paper or
plastic," that's me. I see you all the
time. Bennett Marco. Checks from the
First National Bank, and you always put
your spare change into the March of Dimes
thing.
(beat)
Romance novels, instant noodles, No-Doz
and tomatoes.
(Marco frowns)
Anyway, I'm on vacation, holiday in the
City and so forth, I saw you sitting here
... I thought, okay, girl -- it's now or
never.
Beat.
ROSIE
You headed to New York City?
MARCO
Yeah.
ROSIE
Business?
MARCO
No. Guy I knew ... in the Army. He's in
politics now. We've kinda lost touch.
(awkward beat, then)
What's your name?
ROSIE
Eugenie.
MARCO
'Scuse me?
8/18/03
51.
ROSIE
Yeah.
Crazy French pronunciation and
all.
MARCO
It's pretty.
ROSIE
Thanks.
MARCO
I guess your friends call you Jenny.
ROSIE
Not yet they haven't, thank God.
But you
can call me Jenny.
MARCO
What do your friends call you?
ROSIE
Rosie. My full name is Eugenie Rose.
I've always liked the Rosie part better.
Eugenie is, well, fragile.
MARCO
Still. When I asked you your name, you
said it was Eugenie.
ROSIE
Yeah. Well. Maybe 'cause I was feeling
fragile. At the time.
Beat.
Their eyes lock.
Marco blinks --
FB94
FLASH: PFC. BOBBY BAKER -- stares back at him from where
FB94
Rosie was sitting. Bullet hole in his forehead and a small,
lost smile. Reaching out to him --
BLINK.
ROSIE -- as before.
Slight look of puzzlement, because --
MARCO -- is on his feet, rattled, moving out to the aisle --
MARCO
Excuse me.
-- and LURCHING toward the back of the train, nearly losing
his balance as he goes through the sliding doors.

-- Marco catches himself, hands against the bulkhead wall
near the bathroom. Another PASSENGER squeezes past him,
headed in the opposite direction. Marco tries the bathroom
door. Locked. OCCUPIED.
8/18/03
52.
Marco reaches into his pocket for a plastic vial of
medicine. Tries to shake one of the TINY PILLS OUT, but --
A BURLY PASSENGER in the bathroom emerges and the door
SMACKS Marco hard across the back --
-- THE PILLS scatter onto the floor --
MARCO
OW dammit --
BIG MAN
MARCO
Sorry. I didn't know you
It's okay.
It's okay.
were --
-- Marco's DOWN ON HIS KNEES, struggling to gather the pills
together and put them back in the plastic vial. The big man
goes.
ROSIE
sinks down next to him.
Calm.
Deftly plucking the pills
from the floor.
ROSIE
My mother would tell you to wash these.
Marco looks up at her blankly.
She takes the vial, caps it,
gives it back.
ROSIE
I didn't mean to upset you.
MARCO
It's not you, it's me. I'm not -- my
head --
(gestures uselessly)
-- nothing's ...
(stares at her)
I wish I smoked.
ROSIE
It's way overrated.
They stare at each other.
Then:
MARCO
Rosie, I'm gonna go in here, wash my
face, take my pill, and get myself
together.
Marco ducks into the bathroom and shuts the door.
8/18/03
53.
96
96
Marco cups water in his hands and smears it on his face,
wiping it away with a paper towel. He comes up looking in
the mirror, avoiding his own gaze as --
IN THE MIRROR: THE DOOR OPENS
and a man comes partway in -- now it's Dr. Noyle.
Marco pivots -- no Noyle. The door is shut, locked.
He's
all alone. Losing his mind.
97
97
Lost in thought. Faint smile. She puts her hand flat
against the door, then turns and heads back to her seat.
98

Turns to the mirror again ... and again SEES Dr. Noyle
behind him, smiling:
NOYLE
Hello Captain. Do you remember me?
KNOCKING at the door, a pass-key rattling in it --
99
99
emerges from the bathroom to find an irritated CONDUCTOR now
awkwardly trying to extract his key from the door, and Rosie
waiting.
CONDUCTOR
ROSIE
Are you okay, sir?
Ben?
MARCO
... Yeah.
ROSIE
Jesus. You've been in here twenty
minutes. I thought you'd fallen off.
Marco stares at Rosie.
Twenty minutes?
The train SHUDDERS
to a halt --
100
100
Marco comes up the escalator, into a SEA OF COMMUTERS.
Momentarily lost. Rosie is behind him, a moment later with
her bag, and --
ROSIE
I'm gonna get a cab, you want me to drop
you somewhere?
8/18/03
54.
MARCO
No.
I'm okay, thanks.
ROSIE
Your friend gonna meet you here?
MARCO
No.
Beat.
ROSIE
El Dorado 59970.
(off Marco's frown)
My cell phone, in case you -- you know.
I like to say it the old way -- can you
remember the number, or should I write it
on your chest with a sharpie?
MARCO
(small smile)
I'll remember.
Beat.
ROSIE
You're sweating.
MARCO
What?
Marco feels his shirt -- soaked. Long beat. She reaches
out and feels his forehead. No fever. Sizing him up.
ROSIE
Listen. You got a place to go and get
freshened up?
101
101
Rosie lets Marco in. It's incredibly cramped, everything in
one room, window facing a brick wall, lots of play posters.
ROSIE
-- It's my cousin's apartment. She's in
Cleveland with the road company of 'Mamma
Mia.' There's ... a view of the park ...
if you go out on the fire escape and
kinda ... tilt your head ...
Marco puts down the suitcases and waits in the middle of the
room while Rosie takes off her coat, turns on some lights.
ROSIE
I'm nervous. I'm sorry.
I yak when I
get nervous.
8/18/03
55.
MARCO
Me, I get quiet.
Another awkward beat.
She stands there.
Studying him.
ROSIE
You okay?
MARCO
Dreams, I've been having these --
Catches himself.
That's just how Melvin said it.
ROSIE
Is that what happened on the train?
MARCO
Sort of.
Beat.
MARCO
I could be dreaming you.
ROSIE
What if you are?
MARCO
You'd be the best dream I've had in a
long time, Rosie.
Beat.
Rosie smiles at him.
ROSIE
If that's a line, Ben Marco, it kinda
worked.

The water cascades down on him. He
feels around

where the door on the train whacked

hyper, rummaging through the vanity, searching for -- pair
of cuticle scissors, tweezers, anything sharp -- a little
basket of sample perfumes CRASHES into the sink --
ROSIE (O.S.)
(KNOCKING loudly)
Ben, what's going on -- are you okay --?
Marco finds a razor blade -- twisting it clumsily in his
fingers to reach the slight bump on his back he can only
barely see in the mirror --

INTERCUT - ROSIE - OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Ben, I need you to open this door.
Okay?
Just for a sec.

You're scaring me. Ben --?

He SLASHES at the lump.
Blood blossoms.
SLASHES again,
oblivious to pain.
ROSIE
BEN MARCO!?
PUSH IN as Ben presses the blade sharply down into his skin
... cutting a slit through which the blunt edge of
AN EXTREMELY TINY OBLONG THING
appears, like a grain of rice.
It slides out into Ben's
bloody fingers.

Rosie's PUSHING against the door, trying to force it open.

ROSIE
Oh Jesus.

MARCO

a good look at it, and it goes into the sink --
MARCO
SHIT.
Oh no NO ...
-- and down the drain -- Marco twists the faucet off, and
DIVES TO
FLOOR LEVEL - UNDER THE SINK
where he puts both hands on the fittings of the u-joint trap
and struggles to get them loose -- succeeding finally, water
spewing everywhere --
-- the trap falls to the floor, disgorging soap chips, slimy
hairballs and pipe corrosion and water ... but not the thing
he wants. It's --
MARCO
-- Gone.
Shit.
MARCO -- rests his head on the cool tile, eyes far away.
Defeated. Rosie crouches next to him. A little scared.
She blots the blood from his back with the towel, and then
presses her ice pack against it.
MARCO
Tell me you saw that.
Rosie just stares at him.
MARCO
(hollow)
You didn't. You didn't see it.
ROSIE
See what?
Marco closes his eyes.
MARCO
Proof.

Ben and RICHARD DELP ascend at a good clip. Delp wears a
lab coat, trappings of a medical researcher:
MARCO
This wasn't a delusion.
DELP
That's what they all say, Marco.
(then)
Some wicked shit got sprayed on you guys
during Desert Storm. Besides all the
depleted uranium, I mean ...
He stops, unlocks a door, and they go --
112
112
A narrow, glassed-in space with a cluster of monitoring
equipment against the wall of darkened windows. Fluorescent
lights flicker on, revealing a CAVERNOUS SPACE BELOW, in
which an intricate MAZE of CAGES contains unhappy, SCREAMING
research MONKEYS with Orwellian stainless-steel hardware and
antennae bolted to their bisected skulls. Strange SOUNDS
and various LIGHTING EFFECTS emerge from the different
sections.
DELP
... I personally know of a coupla Rangers
who swear that they see only in tertiary
colors now --
MARCO
-- Delp.
DELP
-- and can pick up sports talk radio in
their cortical block if they get too
close to a Con-Ed transformer.
8/18/03
59.
MARCO
-- Delp.
It's not GWS.
Delp has known Marco too long, and too well, not to take him
seriously.
DELP
A dozen years ago, the Army did this tiny
implantable I.D. thing -- you could imbed
it under the skin, then scan it like a
bar code for medical emergency
information, blood-type, DNA. Pentagon
ordered up half a million, and stuck
about five thousand experimentally into
high-risk soldiers and infantry. But the
scanners proved skittish and field
hospitals hated 'em, so the whole deal
got eighty-sixed and forgotten.
MARCO
The Army never put one in me.
DELP
That you know of, man.
That you know of.
(then)
How'd you find me?
MARCO (V.O.)
I looked under Mad Scientists in the
yellow pages -- there was a full page ad.
DELP
Ha ha.
Marco stares down into a big pit. Among the racks of
equipment are two primate-sized stainless-steel beds with
restraints and I.V. trees waiting.
DELP
You seriously believe somebody's messed
with your mother board.
MARCO
What are you studying here, Delp?
DELP
Fear.
MARCO
For the Agency?
DELP
Nah, CIA cut me loose in '97 during the
Macedonian debacle. Now I got this
little grant from Wal-Mart.
8/18/03
60.
Wal-Mart? Fear? Marco looks at the monkeys. Doesn't want
to know any more. He shifts his gaze back to Delp. Studies
him. Then:
MARCO
Look, Delp. My experiences during the
war, in Kuwait ... feel dreamlike to me.
And my dreams? About what happened?
Feel as real as you and me, here, right
now.
Delp just waits.
MARCO
It's like ... I feel like somewhere along
the line, I've been ... brainwashed. Or
something. You know? All scrambled up.
DELP
We've all been brainwashed, Marco.
Religion, advertising, television.
Politics. We accept what's normal
because we're told it's normal and we
crave normalcy. Hell, look at the
Germans under Hitler. Disco, in the
seventies.
(beat)
And if you're really worried about
somebody imbedding electric probes and
computer chips in your brain to make you
do things -- it's horseshit, man. Turns
out Pavlov had it right from the getgo.
Dogs and all. A little ECT and sleep
deprivation will do the trick for a
fraction of the price. Ask the Uzbeks.
And you would remember it.
MARCO
What about my dreams?
DELP
(shrugs)
What if all this is the fucking dream and
you're still back in Kuwait?
MARCO
You're not helping me.
DELP
I am. You're not helping yourself.
Reality is consensual, man. You just
gotta prove it up. Or play it out.

supporters behind a chain link fence --

117
Raymond and Marco in the back seat facing forward. Anderson
and campaign handler MIRELLA FREEMAN sit facing them,
talking low, on a cell phone, as:
RAYMOND
I saw Mavole's Mom and Dad in St. Louis.
I still visit them -- and Baker's mom --
when I can. Do you keep up with anybody
from the unit besides Al Melvin?
MARCO
I don't keep up with Al Melvin.
He found
me.
RAYMOND
Why did you ask me about Kuwait?
MARCO
(pleasantly:)
I didn't. I asked you about your dreams.
At the fundraiser -- why did you say you
needed to talk to me?
MIRELLA
(covers the phone)
Mr. Shaw, excuse me -- they want to know
if you'll do an interview with Larry King
at six.
RAYMOND
No.
(to Marco)
What do you want from me, Captain?
MARCO
Major.
Forty minutes of your time.
MIRELLA
No to the interview, or no to six?
RAYMOND
He wants to talk about my mother.
No.
He looks at Marco --
MARCO
Private time.
RAYMOND
Well, we've got about five minutes, right
now. And this is as private as it gets
for me anymore, so ...
Beat.
He waits.
Anderson staring at Marco.
8/18/03

MARCO
There are these dreams that ... some of
the men in our unit have been having.
RAYMOND
Including you?
MARCO
It's a question of what actually happened
the night our patrol was attacked --
RAYMOND
That's easy.
(almost automatic)
RPG incoming. Mortar fire, we're
ambushed. Total chaos. I can't locate
Baker or Mavole. You're knocked
unconscious -- I find you and pull you to
safety and then --
MARCO
(cuts him off)
-- Yeah, that's how I remember it, too.
(beat)
But I dream something else.
The limo pulls to a curb --
118
119
Huge posters featuring Raymond's face, emblazoned with
SECURE TOMORROW, stacked against the wall. A desk covered
with papers and enough take-out Chinese food for ten people,
and Raymond sits behind it, nursing a glass of wine, and
pointedly ignoring Melvin's notebook, while:
RAYMOND
I kill Mavole?
MARCO
It's a dream --
RAYMOND
No.
MARCO
-- could mean something else.
RAYMOND
No.
MARCO
-- could be I'm just supposed to think
you did.
RAYMOND
-- I killed the enemy. I didn't know
them, either. So it was okay. And,
anyway, I remember what we did in Kuwait,
I remember it perfectly. But now that
you mention it, I don't remember doing it
... exactly.
MARCO
Maybe you didn't.
RAYMOND
NO.
What a thought.
Now he picks up the dream book. Marco watches. Raymond
flips through the pages for a moment, dismissively. Then
stops at something Melvin has drawn. Frowns. Raises his
eyebrows. Closes it, sets it down:
RAYMOND
Life is so bizarre, isn't it? This
absurd campaign, the sordid world of
politics, my whole public life and
persona -- sometimes, occasionally, for
an instant, the fog clears and I look and
I think, what am I doing? I mean, what
the fuck am I doing? Posing and grinning
like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands
with total strangers who must be blind if

8/18/03

RAYMOND (CONT'D)
they can't see what I am, at the core.
What my mother has made me.
Raymond looks steadily at Marco ... who nods, interested:
RAYMOND
A Prentiss. Ferociously, a Prentiss --
but not a Shaw, God forbid -- I was
molded by cold hard hands, every detail
of my existence preordained. Can you
even imagine, Ben, how it would feel
never to have a say in what your life
would be? I was twenty years old before
I had a friend -- no, worse, a girlfriend
-- well, almost -- but, yes, a friend, or
I thought so -- outside my mother's
circle of approved encounters -- and it
didn't -- she wouldn't -- precipitating
my one act of rebellion, storming off and
enlisting --
(grimaces)
-- in the Army. Which, ironically, only
served ultimately to pad my gilded
Prentiss resume. You know: "fluent in
five languages, Phi Beta Kappa,
Congressional Medal of Honor, blah blah
blah."
(beat)
And after the war I came back to her.
And the family legacy. This. Mother
calls it, "fulfilling my Manifest
Prentiss Destiny."
MARCO
Why did you come back, Raymond?
What
happened?
RAYMOND
What?
Seeming startled, Raymond's reverie is broken.
His eyes
harden as he refocuses on Marco.
RAYMOND
Weren't you listening? Mother happened.
(then)
You know, the truth is, I hate it. I've
always despised it.
MARCO
(lost)
Which?
RAYMOND
The medal. The cloying adulation of the
little people. Your pitiful jealousy --
8/18/03
67.
MARCO
Who said I was jealous?
RAYMOND
I don't have the dreams, Ben.
MARCO
How can you not remember saving the unit?
RAYMOND
I do.
I said I did.
MARCO
You said you don't remember doing it.
RAYMOND
Ha ha, don't mix me up, I'm tired, and --
Fine. It's like this. It's as if I know
what will happen, Ben, but I never get to
the part where I feel that it actually
did happen. But I think that's probably
perfectly normal.
MARCO
Did you ever talk to anybody about this
little discrepancy?
RAYMOND
What? No. Who would I ask? My old Army
"buddies," who love and adore me for
saving their pathetically unimportant --
present company excluded -- asses?
MARCO
No.
You ask Army Intelligence.
(getting excited)
Look, we can go together, tomorrow. You
tell them what you just told me,
everything you do remember, what you
don't "exactly" remember, about Kuwait,
let 'em run some tests on you --
RAYMOND
I'm sure the press would have a field day
with that.
MARCO
Raymond. They put an implant in me. I
found it yesterday. Maybe they put one
in you.
RAYMOND
(horrified)
Nobody's put anything in me.

MARCO
Great. Let's prove it. We can go get an
x-ray -- we can check it right now --
Marco moves toward him, Raymond backs away --
RAYMOND
I want to be supportive of you, Ben, I
do, but --
MARCO
Just check your back, Raymond --
RAYMOND
-- this can wait until after the
election.
MARCO
What are you afraid of?
See if there's a
bump.
RAYMOND
You should leave.
This is not, this is
not --
MARCO
-- just check --
RAYMOND
(without checking)
There's nothing there!
Marco LUNGES at Raymond -- they fall, together, over the
desk, onto the floor -- Chinese food scattering.
MARCO
Somebody was in your head, with big steel-
toe boots, a couple of cable cutters and
a chainsaw, and they went to town!
Neurons got wasted, circuits rewired,
brain cells obliterated --
KNOCKING at the door:
ANDERSON (O.S.)
Congressman Shaw?

-- you don't even know what they did!
You don't -- you can't CONCEIVE what they
did to you -- and you're worried about
some lame-ass reporters!?

headlock, RIPS Raymond's shirt from the shoulder --

INSISTENT KNOCKING at the door. Marco CLAWS AT THE SKIN on
RAYMOND'S BACK -- sinks his teeth in --
-- Raymond shakes him off, and MARCO slams into the wall.
The office door BANGS open --
Anderson and other agents SWARM Marco -- there's blood
smeared on Marco's mouth, his jaws are clenched --
ANDERSON
(disbelief)
He bit him.
(at Raymond)
Sir, did he bite you?
RAYMOND
No.
MARCO -- shoved to the floor -- twisted -- handcuffed --
blood SMEARING across the carpet -- his eyes wild with
adrenaline and fear --
RAYMOND -- his hand goes to his back -- his eyes LOCK with
Marco's for an instant -- then Marco is hustled out the
door.
ANDERSON
Sir --
RAYMOND
NOTHING HAPPENED!
Horrified campaign workers crane necks to see inside. Mute
with shock, Raymond pulls his hand away from his back.
Hides the blood.

dining room, the ever-present Secret Service.
RAYMOND
No. That'd be political suicide. Of
course not. I want you to help him.
ELLIE
I can't even imagine why.
RAYMOND
Because I feel sorry for him.
Because I
said I would.
ELLIE
What should we do?
Make him a General?
RAYMOND
Mother. Look. My campaign people are
getting a restraining order, he's going
on all the security watch-lists -- but I
won't lock him up. I'm not pressing
charges.
ELLIE
What?
RAYMOND
It's complicated -- I don't know. It's
just complicated and I don't want to talk
about it, I want to get back to the
campaign and focus on --
ELLIE
You don't actually believe his story?
RAYMOND
No. But he does. And he's a fine
soldier and ... my friend. And if his
slim hold on sanity requires that I
tolerate his delusions until he can get
help, I'll do it. It doesn't diminish
me. And I'm not afraid of him.
ELLIE
This is why voters love you. Your
humanity and everything. I've never
projected humanity.
RAYMOND
Yes I think telling people you want to

That was a joke, you dreadful boy.
A BUSBOY delivers Ellie her meal: a thick steak stuffed with
viscous grey -- off Raymond's disgust:
ELLIE
Carpetbag steak.
RAYMOND
Stuffed.
With oysters?
She starts to cut meat into child-like, bite-sized pieces
and put them on a side plate, for Raymond.
ELLIE
The steak part is mostly for you.
Doesn't it look yummy?
RAYMOND
My God. In the world's literature of
food could there possibly be a more
vulgar dish?
ELLIE
And eating it is an absolute sexual
experience. Try some.
RAYMOND
Promise me that you'll help him.
Ellie stops, sighs, puts her fork down and reaches for the
oversized-satchel that doubles as her briefcase and purse.
ELLIE
Oh, Raymond, how much do you really know
about your friend?
Ellie finds two thick files and plops them down, as
punctuation, in front of Raymond.

Marco stares, troubled and sad, at bleak photographs of Al
Melvin's bloated, waterlogged corpse.
MARCO
I went to talk to him.
But he wasn't
there.
Across from him are three impatient FBI AGENTS (RAMIREZ,
GOLDRING and JONAS). Ramirez has the notebook Marco took
from Melvin's. Goldring pushes a tiny digital tape recorder
closer to Marco:
AGENT GOLDRING
Talk about what?
Marco hesitates -- looks to Lt. Col. Howard, who sits
grimly, off the one side, with Col. Garret.
AGENT GOLDRING
Dreams?
A lone woman, SPECIAL AGENT VOLK, sits in a distant corner
on a folding chair. She's implacable, staring intently at
Marco. Ramirez holds up the notebook -- a page of crazy
drawings and text.
MARCO
Yeah, there are hundreds more of those in
his apartment. Did your people check out
his place --?
AGENT JONAS
Colonel Garret kindly showed us the file
on you, Marco, you're the shit: Special
Forces. Rangers. Delta.
MARCO
I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin about
some unanswered questions involving our
reconnaissance mission in Kuwait, back in
'91 --
AGENT JONAS
(talks over him)
And he wasn't there, so, what -- you
thought it'd be okay to break in and wait
for him?
Marco carefully, respectfully stacks the photographs of
Melvin and turns them over. Exchanges a glance with the
female agent.
8/18/03
73.
MARCO
(at Howard)
I know this game. Will you explain to
them that I know this game?
AGENT RAMIREZ
Oh right. Army Intelligence.
Isn't that
an oxymoron?
MARCO
Yeah.
Kinda like 'special agent.'
COLONEL GARRET
Cut it out, Major.
AGENT GOLDRING
What's your obsession with Raymond Shaw?
AGENT RAMIREZ
Man of his dreams.
MARCO
Listen, you might want to advise your ME
to check for an implant in Corporal
Melvin's back -- under the skin, just shy
of the scapula, left side ... if he's not
looking for it, he won't find it.
Implant.
The Feds just stare at him.
Like he's nuts.
MARCO
I didn't have anything to do with
Corporal Melvin's death.
AGENT JONAS
Yeah, well, that's your opinion, but
judging from your file here, apparently
you don't know your shit from your
oatmeal, my friend --
Marco snaps, spins out of his chair and lunges at Jonas --
Lt. Col. Howard and the other agents step between the two
men -- pull them apart --
LT. COL. HOWARD
(re: Jonas)
Get this man out of here.
AGENT JONAS
(taunting Marco)
Go ahead, nutball. Try it.
Marco PUNCHES the agent so hard it knocks him down to the
floor between the other two.
AGENT JONAS
-- He hit me! Fuck!
8/18/03
74.
MARCO
He said I could.
Colonel Garret shoves Marco back into a chair, stays in the
middle of the fracas, while --
LT. COL. HOWARD
Okay, OKAY --! That's enough.
Gentlemen, I need a moment with Major
Marco. Now.
The Federal Agents retreat with their bloodied-nose, cold-
cocked colleague, door slamming behind them.
ELLIE (V.O.)
Evidently this has been going on for
years ...
Only Agent Volk remains, unmoved by what just occurred.
CLOSE ON - MARCO, catching his breath.
ELLIE (V.O.)
... Sad little Tin Soldier.
124

Ellie eats, while Raymond flips through Marco's extensive
file: cross-agency surveillance, Army psychological
profiling, FBI updates. Repeated buzzwords like: "mentally
unstable," "obsessed with Raymond Shaw," "delusional,"
"borderline functional," "acute stress disorder ..."
ELLIE
Isn't it disgraceful the way troubled
individuals are allowed to simply walk
around with the rest of us until
something horrible happens? Another
failure of the HMOs. I'm thinking of
sponsoring a bill, with Senator Friedman
of Rhode Island --
RAYMOND
-- I don't care.
ELLIE
Well, imagine how terrified your people
were yesterday when Major Marco showed up
at the airport and you invited him -- my
God, invited him -- to tag along.
Knowing what they knew.
RAYMOND
I know him. I served under him.
He was
a good man.
8/18/03

ELLIE
That's what the neighbors always say
about serial killers.
Raymond stares at an old PHOTOGRAPH OF MARCO: curled up in a
fetal position, on a V.A. hospital bed.
ELLIE
(sighs)
Perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a
less stressful posting. Somewhere
tropical.
125
125
Marco with Howard, who's visibly upset. He likes Marco, it
breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this. Agent
Volk remains in her chair, on the other side of the room:
The door opens, and Col. Garret comes in, with Agent
Goldring, who gives Marco back his personal effects, and:
AGENT GOLDRING
Goodbye.
(to Marco)
Get out of here.
LT. COL. HOWARD
He's free to go?
AGENT GOLDRING
Shaw won't press charges, and he's got
juice with important friends. It's
today's daily double.
Agent Volk closes her notebook and moves past Goldring as he
picks up the tape recorder. She glances at Howard, and
leaves the room.
COLONEL GARRET
Someone from Senator Eleanor Shaw's
office called and intervened on your
behalf.
A beat.
Marco, trying to process all this:
COLONEL GARRET
Major, you have reached the terminal end
of the Army's patience. You're relieved
of duty, effective immediately.
LT. COL. HOWARD
There's a young neurologist at Walter
Reed. Zahn. He's had considerable
success with GWS -- I want you to get

Delp freaked and hyper, gathering wires and whatnot from

Yes.
DELP

Delp rounds a corner -- monkeys scrambling around their

MARCO
sits on one of the experimental gurneys, using a pen to
write on his arm.
DELP
No. I'll still owe you for getting my
sorry ass out of Albania.
MARCO
-- Talk to me about the implant.
DELP
Manchurian Global. Heard of 'em?
(off Marco:)
Private equity fund, specializes in
military support services and weapons
research ... including a certain Army
implant project that went belly-up in the
early 90s.
MARCO
You said the Army implants were for
medical emergency data.
DELP
The ones they publicized were. But, oh
man, there was a parallel project of all
kinds of scary implantable shit the
Clinton watchdogs finally freaked out
over, and closed down.
MARCO
How do you know all this?
DELP
Cuz they funded me to make some of their
scary shit.
MARCO
What does it do?
DELP
I don't know. I don't want to know. You

DELP
eases Marco back on the gurney, deftly puts some I.V. taps
into his arms. Marco's legs hang over the edge.
DELP
These are built for monkeys, so bear

SERIES OF SHOTS
He's putting thread-thin electrodes INTO Marco's head, just
beneath the skin.
DELP
I'm putting you on a cocktail of
methohexitol to take the edge off.
MARCO
Edge off what?
DELP
'Getting clarity.' Or whatever you want
to call it -- ECT not being the precise
science that, say, leeching is.
Wires snake across the floor to the ECT [Electro-Convulsive
Therapy] unit.
MARCO
You don't think this is going to work.
DELP
It's the desperation move, man. But,
hey. There is a school of thought, says
a victim of induced abreaction -- or
ultra-paradoxical brain activity, if
you're at all correct about what happened
to you -- can have it effectively
dispersed by electroshock. Unscrambled.
MARCO
-- But?
DELP
But the legions of naysayers will tell
you that if the initial work's done
correctly -- if the brain's been not just
washed, but dry-cleaned --
Takes out a bite-guard and puts it in Marco's mouth:

DELP

He throws the switch, sending electric current through

That's right.

How did I get here?
ROSIE
You called me.
MARCO
El Dorado 59970.

part's over.
MARCO
What'd we talk about?

You said you "loved" me. Not to scare
you. Out of nowhere, but more than once.
MARCO

She leans in, kisses him lightly.
ROSIE
Liar.
MARCO

Rosie opens her mouth --

Two beats of silence, then --

Marco wakes up. Clear headed. Calm. Rosie is asleep
beside him on the bed. The television is off.

Marco drinks water from the faucet, wipes his mouth. Stares
at himself in the mirror -- he looks like death warmed over.
Starts to smile ...
... but his eyes stray up to the half-open mirror of the
vanity -- reflecting, behind him, the bathroom wall: towel
racks, wall paper, a high VENT ... with a FAINT RED LED
glowing INSIDE.
JUMP CUT: MARCO
Standing on the edge of the tub, stretched out, face pressed
up to the vent, trying to see inside --
SUBJECTIVE: MARCO (B&W;) - THROUGH THE VENT
Looking back at Marco, peering in.

Marco taping newspapers over all the heating vents --
Marco going through cupboard, drawers, closets, looking for
... what, exactly?
He doesn't know. His world is caving in.
He pivots, looks
at Rosie, still sleeping.
Rosie's purse is dumped out on the table, and now Marco's
going through her suitcase.
He's dressed, now, even has his coat on.
Pulling out her clothing, discovering, at the bottom:
FILE FOLDERS, NOTES, REPORTS
Much of the same material that Eleanor Shaw showed Raymond.
Incriminating stuff about Marco, timetables, surveillance
photographs, psychiatric evaluations and

Rosie, rolling off the bed, sleepy, crossing to where Marco
is gathering the files --
ROSIE
What are you ... oh God.
Sees the hard look on Marco's face. Newspapers over all the
vents. Opens her mouth to explain but Marco SWINGS HARD,
and hits her -- she partially blocks it with her forearm --
backhands her onto the floor --
MARCO
You're part of it.
-- then he's moving, out the door --
ROSIE
Don't --
8/18/03

She leaps at him -- SHOVES him hard into the wall, and when
he whirls to shake her off, slips down and uses his weight
and momentum to toss Marco crashing halfway back across the
room.
Now she's between him and the door.
ROSIE
Don't do this, Ben.
It's not what you
think.
MARCO
How can you know what I think?
He tries to get past her again --
THEY FIGHT
Rosie can't beat him, but she's extremely skilled -- Marco
gets stung twice by hard rights -- but whirls, all-defense,
an improvised rope-a-dope that gives him the opening he
needs --
-- he SMACKS Rosie sharply, stunning her -- and as she rocks
backward he flies out the door --
ROSIE

A CARETAKER rattling keys impatiently behind him, Marco

Marco deep in research, at a small table covered with books
and paper -- a crazy man's kind of chaos.
The file he stole from Rosie's is disemboweled across the

Presidents, deposed Kings, retired Prime
Ministers, Ayatollahs, African War-Lords,
fallen Communist Dictators and an
assortment of the Fucking Rich, who are
distinguished from the merely Filthy Rich
by factors of billions.
He puts the Noyle file down, pushes everything away.
JORDAN
You bring me rumors and conjecture.
MARCO
I started with nightmares, sir. Rumors
and conjecture are a giant leap forward.
JORDAN
Nightmares you've interpreted, using as
primary resources a) your spotty memory,
b) the internet -- sacred sanctuary of
idiots and nutters -- and c) random faces
and coincidences, and evidence you chewed

Marco stares at Jordan.
MARCO
I just want to try and stop this one
thing -- this Raymond Shaw bomb -- from

Jordan nods again, slightly.
Lost in thought.

RAYMOND
No.
JORDAN
His name is Atticus Noyle. He is a South
African physician, neuropsychiatric
scientist and mercenary -- someone our
CIA trained for covert mind warfare
against the Soviets in Aghanistan --
someone who has sold technology to and
done research for terrorist groups, and
rogue states. Major Marco claims that
this man --
ELLIE
JORDAN
-- brainwashed you --
-- In his dreams.
RAYMOND
Sir, Ben Marco is sick.
Delusional.
8/18/03
92.
JORDAN
Nevertheless he's pulled from his mad hat
some remarkably lucid connections between
his dreams of your exploits in Kuwait,
and this Dr. Noyle, and the private
equity fund Manchurian Global --
Raymond frowns, looks from Jordan to Ellie.
JORDAN
-- your mother's primary political
benefactor for the past fifteen years.
ELLIE
Christ, Tom. They contribute to half the
Senate, for God's sake.
Silence.
RAYMOND
I don't understand.
JORDAN
At the time of Desert Storm, Dr. Atticus
Noyle was working under a research grant
from Manchurian Global. Your mother's
friend.
The color suddenly drains out of Ellie's face.
RAYMOND
What?
JORDAN
Rogue scientists. Mind control.
Manchurian Global. Your mother. You.
Connect the dots, Raymond. Possibly,
your mother's blind to them, because they
pay their way --
ELLIE
Possibly the Senator's motives are
colored by his desperation to get himself
back on the presidential ticket now that
the heavy lifting is done --
RAYMOND
(unraveling)
I don't -- I don't --
JORDAN
It's not about me. As far as I'm
concerned, this should never come out --
it would shred what little remains of the
fabric of our public trust -- think of
the nation --
8/18/03
93.
RAYMOND
I don't have the dreams.
ELLIE
He can't prove anything.
JORDAN
Everything you stand for is upside down!
If this were to come out, true or no, it
would be catastrophic for the campaign.
(beat, a threat?)
And it will come out.
RAYMOND
What are you saying?
Silence.
The question hangs there.
RAYMOND
What do I do?
JORDAN
You withdraw. You bow out gracefully.
Personal reasons. An obscure illness.
Yield your spot on the ticket, go into
seclusion ...
He glances coolly at Ellie --
JORDAN
... and then surrender yourself to
federal authorities who can help you
address the damage that may have been
inflicted on you.
-- and walks out. Raymond and Eleanor have hardly moved.
Sound of the front door opening, closing.
RAYMOND
I feel sick. Christ.
What have you done
to me?
ELLIE
Raymond, remember when --
RAYMOND
NO, never mind -- don't bother. Don't
lie. Don't say anything. No more lies.
There are actual tears in Ellie's eyes.
Raymond just stares
at her, coldly.
RAYMOND
I can promise you that whatever you've
done, I will undo it.
8/18/03
94.
ELLIE
I know -- I know, baby --
RAYMOND
I never want to see you or speak to you
again --
ELLIE
Raymond --
RAYMOND
-- I mean it this time.
Raymond heads for the door --
ELLIE
Sergeant Shaw --
Raymond slows -- curious to be addressed like this -- sound
of the desert wind rises --
ELLIE
-- Sergeant Raymond Shaw --
He's turning -- the room coming alive -- light shifting,
intensifying -- that terrible vividness -- and the wall of
the zaghareet ...
EXTREMELY CLOSE ON - ELLIE
ELLIE
Raymond Prentiss Shaw --
(sad)
Listen:
CRASH:
155
155
Marco jolts awake, as if from a bad dream, startled --
cramped on a bench, just another rumpled, weary traveler --
early morning commuters gliding past him like a fog.
156
157
The house is beautiful, everything perfect. FLOAT through
FINDING Jocie in a back bedroom, waking slowly in a huge
bed, rolling to look out the window and watch her father, in
his kayak, paddling away ...
8/18/03
95.
158
158
Marco grabs a coffee from off a Starbucks counter, picks up
his bag and heads toward the New York City line platform, to
catch his train --
159
161
Jocie wanders, sleepy, into the main room, pulling on a
hooded sweatshirt -- and SEES, THROUGH THE BAY WINDOWS:
-- her father's upended kayak.
-- a figure in the water, as if trying to save him --
162
165
staring numbly at the news report on a little portable t.v.
in a NEWS KIOSK --
166
166
SLOWING MOTION: the world a blur around Raymond as he walks
a gauntlet of reporters shouting questions: about policy,
about Jordan. Expressionless, he just keeps walking, but
his lips move --
-- "tragedy" -- "senseless" -- "great loss" --
167
168
Rosie asleep. PUSH IN RAPIDLY ... then a HAND comes down
hard and efficiently against her throat --
-- she wakes up, fighting for air --
MARCO
(a whisper)
How does the President die?
He sits on top of her, pinning her arms down.
She struggles
to say something. Marco shakes his head.
8/18/03
99.
MARCO
When.
Where. How.
He releases her throat, and she gasps for air --
MARCO
I'm gonna stop this. We'll go to the
Feds. You and me. And tell them a
story.
ROSIE
Who'll -- believe --
MARCO
I don't know. I don't care any more.
It's all I have.
Rosie bucks -- gets a hand free -- SLUGS, Marco, and they
tumble off the bed in a tangle of blankets and limbs --
ROSIE
comes up holding a 9 mm revolver to Marco's forehead.
ROSIE
I am the Feds.
She coughs.
Marco stares at her, dumbfounded.
ROSIE
We've been watching you, trying to sort
this out. I mean, it's either you're
telling it straight and we've all got
something big-time to worry about, or
you're crazy and dangerous -- either way
we've had to keep you on a short leash,
'cuz if we lock you up we'll never know.
(beat)
And we can't tell anybody because we
don't know how deep this river runs.
(beat)
If there is a river.
(off his expression)
You got away from me.
MARCO
Raymond Shaw murdered Senator Jordan and
his daughter.
ROSIE
(shaking her head)
Oh Ben. The thing is? I want to believe
you. God help me, Ben, I do.
MARCO
-- he's a time bomb, ticking --
8/18/03
100.
ROSIE
Everybody else wants you junked up on
Thorazine and just not a problem any
more.
MARCO
I am clearer on this than I've ever been.
It's rich guys, funding bad science, to
put a sleeper in the White House --
ROSIE
Listen to yourself. You're a poster boy
for paranoid fantasies.
Beat.
Silence, broken only by their breathing.
MARCO
I screwed up. Jordan was my trump card,
and I screwed it up.
(then)
Either help me, or shoot me, Rosie.
There's no middle ground anymore.
He gets up -- Rosie's not going to shoot him --
SMASH CUT TO:
169
NOYLE
169
frowning --
NOYLE
Raymond -- Raymond --
TURN:
DREAMSCAPE - AS BEFORE
Raymond hands a service revolver past Noyle, to
MARCO -- who primes it, aims --
NOYLE (O.S.)
Captain Marco, would you please shoot
Private Baker so we can move on?
-- MARCO SHOOTS BAKER IN THE FOREHEAD --
170

RAYMOND
Aaaahhhhhhh --!
Raymond awakens with a startled about, face flushed,
sweating. Terrified --
8/18/03
101.
MIRELLA/ANDERSON
Aaaahhhhhh --!
-- Raymond finds himself in the back seat of his limo, his
campaign aide Mirella, her assistant, and Anderson, all
startled and shouting too --
MIRELLA
You okay?
RAYMOND
Yeah.
Yes. Bad dream.
ANDERSON
We've arrived, Congressman.
Raymond sits up.
RAYMOND
Okay.
171
172
A temporary polling place. Flags, tables, not too crowded.
VOTERS stepping out of the way. POLL VOLUNTEERS pressing in
to shake hands and wish Raymond Shaw good luck. And
ROSIE
on the edge. She badges Anderson, and talks to him. He
nods, moves over and talks quietly to Raymond as Raymond
signs his name in the voter registration log.
Then lets Rosie guide him to a booth on the end --
173
173
pulls the giant lever, the curtains close, finds --
A NOTE -- folded, taped to the machine.
RAYMOND -- opens it, reads it.
8/18/03
102.
VOTING BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER
the curtain opens and Raymond steps out, smiling again.
Cameras flash, video crews wave boom mikes, expecting a
sound bite:
RAYMOND
I was on the fence when I walked in there
... but then I saw my name on the ballot
and I knew what I had to do.
Laughter. He whispers to a poll volunteer, and she points
him down a hallway --
174
174
Raymond, Rosie and his Secret Service detail -- Rosie leads
them to a doorway, holds it open for Raymond, but puts her
hand lightly on Anderson's chest when he starts to go in to
sweep the room --
ROSIE
It's clean.
175
175
Small, and private. Raymond turns on the light. Marco is
in the corner, waiting. His Noyle File in one hand.
MARCO
How's your back?
RAYMOND
It hurts.
MARCO
I'm sorry.
Raymond locks the door, turns, takes in the room: tiny
chairs and tables, walls covered with kids' drawings, and
nearly every object in the room named and labelled with 3x5
cards.
RAYMOND
I've been having the dreams, Ben.
MARCO
That's good.
RAYMOND
Good? They're inside my head. They got
inside, the way you said they would --
MARCO
We'll get 'em out.
8/18/03
103.
RAYMOND
They're all ... twisted together -- and I
dream things, terrible things, that can't
possibly have happened. I'm gone, Ben --
I'm losing it --
MARCO
No -- you could have had me locked up --
and you didn't. That's a sign.
RAYMOND
Of what?
MARCO
That they don't control everything. We
can fight it. I mean -- I'm still out
here because you decided I should be --
which means there's a part they can't get
to, deep inside -- the part where the
truth is, and they can't touch us there.
That's what we need to tap into, Raymond,
that's the part where, you and me, we're
gonna take them out.
RAYMOND
Jocie's dead.
MARCO
I know.
RAYMOND
-- and the Senator.
MARCO
Yeah.
Beat.
RAYMOND
Did I do it?
MARCO
I think so, yeah.
RAYMOND
I don't remember.
I don't remember it.
Raymond looks up at Ben.
Emotionless.
Uncomprehending.

ANDERSON (O.S.)
Mr. Shaw?
RAYMOND
Just a minute.
Raymond's cell phone RINGS.
RAYMOND
All I've ever done is what I was supposed
to do. What I was told to do --
MARCO
Raymond -- focus --
RAYMOND
-- What others want me to do.
MARCO
Did they tell you what they want you to
do, Ray? We gotta know what's gonna
happen, we gotta know when's it gonna
happen -- you can help me do this --
RAYMOND
You don't think they saw this coming?
You don't think they factored you in?
(matter of fact)
I need to die, Ben.
MARCO
What? No -- no, man, they've got big
plans for you --
RAYMOND
I'm the enemy, Major Marco, and the only
way to stop me is to kill me. I thought
you were smarter than this.
MARCO
I can get the Feds, the police.
Come on,
Ray -- fight it --
RAYMOND
Are we friends?
8/18/03
105.
MARCO
Raymond, you gotta work with me here --
Raymond takes the ringing phone from his inside pocket, and
checks the number of who's calling.
RAYMOND
I want to believe we're friends.
MARCO
Raymond, stay focused. The irrefutable
fact is that Jocie was a mistake, and
we're gonna make 'em pay for it.
RAYMOND
I dream you, Ben. You kill Private
Baker.

The happy chaos of screaming kids. Raymond emerges,
smiling. Surrounded immediately by Anderson and his secret

ROSIE

Now it's locked.
She bangs on it --
KICKS it open --
182

Empty. Marco gone. The Noyle File lies open -- and empty --
on the floor. She rushes through a connecting door --

kill you.
RAYMOND
The Major is an excellent marksman.
She touches his bare shoulder, leaves her hand there.
RAYMOND
But what will happen to him?
ELLIE
(gentle)
The assassin always dies, baby. It's
necessary for the national healing.
She takes his shirt off a hanger, he stands up, and she
starts to dress him --
ELLIE
I'm sure you will never entirely
comprehend this, darling, and I know, the
way you are right now, this is like
trying to have a whimpered conversation
with someone on a distant star ... but it
must be said, Raymond -- I did this for
you -- so that you could have what I
could not, what your father didn't want --
what your grandfather dared to dream
possible --
She runs her hands through his hair.
Tears fill her eyes.
ELLIE
-- when you ran away to join the Army,
after that girl, after Jocie -- when you
swore you'd never speak to me again, I
felt your father's shadow pass across us,
and I couldn't let him run you the way
he ruined himself.
(beat)
That's when Mark Whiting came to me with
talk of extraordinary scientific
breakthroughs ... Attitude adjustment ...
Reconciliation ... Greatness. So I let
them take you, and change you. Not too
much. Not so much that you'd notice.
Just enough to bring you back to me.
RAYMOND
Yes, mother.
ELLIE
And look what you have, now! Look how
far we've come! It's working, darling --
they think they own you, but they are
very, very wrong. You're not something

its greatest need.
Raymond is dazzled by Eddie's radiance.
RAYMOND
Yes, mother.
She straightens his tie.
Her hands caress her son's
shoulders.
ELLIE
How much you look like my father, now --
you have his hands, and you hold your
head in the same proud way. And when you
smile it's like I'm a little girl again,
