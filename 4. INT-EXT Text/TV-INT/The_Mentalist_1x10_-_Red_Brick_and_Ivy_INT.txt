      A symposium is taking place, the seats in the hall filled 
      with the world s finest NEUROSCIENTISTS.  At the podium, 
      Leyland University s distinguished-looking CHANCELLOR STERN 
      (50 s) addresses the room.  A STUDENT with a VIDEO CAMERA and 
      LIGHTS films the event.

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                    Our next speaker is one of the 
                    nation s leading cosmonauts.  
                    A rising star in the field of 
                      neuroscience, and a prized member 
                    of the Leyland faculty.  I give you 
                    Alex Nelson. 

      The applause indicates respect and eagerness for Nelson s 
      speech. 

      Chancellor Stern turns with a proud smile to gesture for ALEX 
      NELSON (late 30 s) to take the podium. 

      In the front row, EMILY NELSON watches her husband with 
      adoring admiration.  She blows him a discreet kiss.  Beside 
      her sits PROFESSOR LEWIS STUTZER, Alex Nelson s mentor, and 
      the head of the University s Neuroscience Department.  

      From the wings of the stage, SOPHIE MILLER (30 s) looks at 
      Alex Nelson with a mixture of anger and anxiety.  

      Nelson rises nervously, takes a swig of water from a PLASTIC 
      BOTTLE.  Clutching at his throat, he falls thrashing and 
      gurgling to the floor.  He flails for a moment, then lies 
      still, dead.

      As Emily and the audience react with shouts of surprise and 
      horror, Sophie Miller runs away.


      A RINGING PHONE is answered by RIGSBY.

                          (on phone)

      He listens, covers the mouthpiece and yells.

                    Jane!  Phone for you.

      JANE approaches.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT'D)
                          (holding out the phone)
                    Someone called Sophie Miller.

      That stops Jane short.  It s a name from the past.  And 
      there s what looks like real emotional turmoil going on 
      inside. 

                                  JANE
                    Tell her, tell her I m not here.

                                  JANE
                    -- No, wait.

      He takes the phone from Rigsby.  As this conversation 
      continues, Rigsby and CHO exchange mimed surprise and 
      puzzlement at seeing unflappable Jane so visibly unsure of 
      himself. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Doctor Miller?  This is Jane.

                    I need a big favor.   


      Jane and Lisbon watch through one-way glass as Sophie Miller 
      is interrogated by the Chief of the Leyland P.D. -- ED 
      MACVICAR (30 s/40 s).  Military bearing.  Quiet menace.  

      He fixes Sophie Miller with a not-to-be-fooled gaze.  She 
      gazes right back.

                    Sophie, Alex Nelson s water bottle 
                    contained a ten percent solution of  
                    hydrogen cyanide.  What do you know 
                    about that?

                                  SOPHIE
                    I know hydrogen cyanide is a lethal 
                    poison.  Beyond that, nothing at 
                    all.  And please, call me Ms. 
                    Miller or Doctor Miller.  Or Ma am.  
                    Not Sophie, if you don t mind. 

                                  MACVICAR 
                    You re not setting the boundaries 
                    here.  You were seen by several 
                    witnesses arguing with the victim 
                    shortly before his death.  You fled 
                    the scene immediately after his 
                    death.

                                  MACVICAR
                    Sophie, since your divorce from the 
                    victim two years ago, you ve been 
                    arrested for assaulting him twice, 
                    and made several death threats 
                    against him.  He obtained a 
                      restraining order against you.   

                                  SOPHIE
                          (coolly)
                      I obtained one against him also. 

                                  MACVICAR 
                    That s alright then.  

      MacVicar tosses a PHOTOGRAPH across the table for Sophie to 
      look at: it shows Alex and Emily Nelson together, smiling, 
      happy.

                                  MACVICAR (CONT D)
                    It didn t bother you that Alex had 
                      remarried?  That he had found 
                    happiness with another woman?

                                  SOPHIE
                    Alex and I got past our personal 
                    history.  We had to.  For the sake 
                    of our work together.

                                  MACVICAR 
                    Yes, your work together.  At the 
                    Stutzer Institute.  Which gives you 
                    ready access to hydrogen cyanide.

      Sophie shakes her head, tired.

                                  SOPHIE 
                    I had thought, being innocent, that 
                    I don t need a lawyer.  But you 
                    have some animus against me I see.  
                    I ll say nothing more without a 
                    lawyer present.  

      ON JANE and LISBON in the Observation Room...

      Lisbon looks skeptical.

      FADE IN:


      Carrying a rolled up POSTER, a ROOKIE COP crosses the busy 
      room to MacVicar, who is conferring with Jane and Lisbon.  
      The Rookie waits for MacVicar to acknowledge him before 
      speaking.

                                  MACVICAR

                    I m not saying she isn t good for 
                    it, but there s no solid evidence 
                    to support that right now.  We have 
                    to let her go.  

                                  MACVICAR
                      I disagree.        

                                  LISBON 
                    That s your right.  But CBI is lead 
                    agency on this.  

                                  MACVICAR
                    Yes.  Strange that a Department of 
                    Justice Unit like the CBI is lead 
                    agency.  Because Sophie Miller 
                    called the DOJ switchboard this 
                    morning.  You might almost think 
                    she chose her own investigators.

                    If Sophie Miller called the DOJ 
                    this morning, it s a coincidence.  

      MacVicar can tell there s something hinky going on, but he 
      can t put his finger on what.

                                  MACVICAR

                    What is it Drobey?

      The Rookie hands him the poster.  

                                  ROOKIE COP
                    This was posted up all over the 
                    Leyland Campus during the night.

                    hands, and he has paid the price 
                    for his crimes.  


      Lisbon is reading further from the poster.  Jane, Cho, Lisbon

      She waits.  Long beat.  Deep breath from Jane, diving in. 

                                  JANE 
                    She was my doctor.

                                  LISBON
                    She s a psychiatrist.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  She was my psychiatrist.

                                  LISBON
                    You hate psychiatrists.  So you 
                    always say.

                                  JANE
                    She s a good psychiatrist.

                                  LISBON
                    I guess she must be.  She managed 
                    to keep you in the room.

                                  JANE
                    It was a locked room.  

      Lisbon tries not to overreact.

                    I went through a bad patch. 
                    Had to spend time in a hospital.
                    Sophie helped me through that time.     

      Beat.  This is a big revelation for Lisbon.  She has to 
      recalibrate her sense of who Jane is.

                                  LISBON
                    It s not on your record.

      Off the surveillance tapes...



      Jane and Lisbon approached by a young blonde woman -- KERRY 
      SHEEHAN (early 20 s), a graduate student assistant.  Slim and 
        athletic-looking, Kerry is vaguely reminiscent of a younger 
      version of Sophie if you were to notice, but you wouldn t.  
      At the moment, her eyes are red and her face is blotchy from 
      crying.  She s quivering with emotion.  

                                  KERRY SHEEHAN
                    How do you do.  I m Kerry Sheehan?

                    He can see you now.  I ll bring you 
                    to him.

      She opens a door by typing a code into a keypad, starts 
      leading them down a HALLWAY.

                    We have identified the section of 
                    the brain that governs moral

                    It s a small fold of tissue called 
                    the cingulate gyrus, here in the 
                    medial part of the brain.  This is 
                    the source of good and evil.  We 
                    have learned how it works.  And how 
                    to readjust it when it s not 
                    working correctly.  We have created

                    You are skeptical.  Nevertheless it 
                    is true.  We are plumbing the 
                    depths of the human soul.  Do you

                    Ah, humor.  Good.  Thank you, no.  
                    Your soul is electricity.  The 
                    essence of your being is a series 
                    of rapid electrical impulses.  
                    Morality is a binary switch system 
                    in the brain.  We are learning how 
                    to operate that switch system.

      like eyes, holds out a banana.

                    We recalibrated her anterior 
                    cingulate gyrus.  And look at what 
                    a happy and generous girl she is 
                    now. 

      Jane turns to the monkey, who offers the banana again, 
      grunting plaintively.  Jane takes the banana and, with a 
      quick sleight-of-hand pass, makes it vanish.  The monkey 
      hoots in amazement.  Jane makes the banana reappear, hands it 
      back to the delighted monkey.  Watching, Stutzer smiles.

                                  JANE
                    Is Susan here the full extent of 
                    your animal testing? 

                                    STUTZER
                          (shrugs)
                    There were other monkeys before 
                    her.  Rats.  Mice.  Pigeons.

                                  JANE
                    Have you ever been threatened by 
                    animal rights activists before now?

                                    STUTZER
                    Yes, of course.  If one is a 
                    prominent scientist, one is 
                    sometimes menaced by animal people.  
                    It is always nonsense. 

                                  LISBON
                    In this case, we must assume the 
                    threat is very real.  The Marshals 
                    will provide you with full 
                      protection, but you re going to 
                    need to be careful.

      Stutzer makes a dismissive noise, goes to his desk and pulls 
      out a small REVOLVER.  

                                    STUTZER 
                    I am not intimidated.  What we are 
                    doing here is far too important.
                    In the long term, this technology 
                    has the potential to eradicate 
                    violence from human relations.  
                    That s what these animal rights 
                    maniacs don t understand.  We are 
                    trying to create a world of peace, 
                    where everyone is safe. 

                                  JANE
                    From monkey attacks.

                                    STUTZER 
                          (blinks)
                    Ah.  More humor.  Yes.  Monkeys are 
                    very different from us.  Come this 
                    way... 


      Stutzer leads the way to an interior door.  Lisbon and Jane 
      follow...

                                    STUTZER
                    We are already well past the animal 
                    testing, and into the first stages 
                    of testing on humans.

      He types a code into the keypad, pushes open the door to 
      reveal...          THE MENTALIST     "Red Brick & Ivy"     GRAY 12/05/08     16.



      Very much like an interrogation room.  A COLLEGE STUDENT 
      wearing EEG ELECTRODES strapped to his head sits on one side 
      of a glass wall at a small desk, and a PSYCHOLOGIST sits at a 
      control panel on the other side of the glass, taking notes, 
      off data provided by a hi-tech stack of MONITORS and CONTROL 
      PANELS that display a variety of info about the subject from 
      pulse rate to brain wave patterns.  

      From the test subjects s perspective, the glass is a SCREEN 
      on which is displayed A HYPNOTIC LOOP OF RIPPLING WATER.

      An affectless recorded FEMALE VOICE asks questions over 
      speakers.  

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

                    The life of a forty-five year old 
                    homeless male drug addict, or B.   
                      A priceless masterpiece painted by 
                      Rembrandt.  Which do you choose?  

                                    COLLEGE STUDENT
                    B.

                    Question six...

      Stutzer shuts the door.


      A roomful of LOST SOULS sit staring vacantly at an old black 
      and white television.  The air is blue with cigarette smoke.  
      Jane sits among them, face empty of expression, eyes far 
      away.  Sophie (brunette) approaches, crouches down to catch 
      Jane s eye.  

                                  SOPHIE
                    Patrick, my name is Sophie Miller. 

      Jane continues to stare at the television, seemingly unaware 
      that Sophie is even there.

                                  SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                    Patrick, look at me.  I m going to 
                    help you get better.

        A despairing smile ghosts across Jane s face as he looks 
      sidelong at Sophie.

                                  JANE
                    Good luck. 

      END FLASHBACK


      Rigsby runs through the SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE, watched by 
      Cho and Van Pelt.  

      ON-SCREEN:  A campus street.  A battered old VAN pulls up, a 
      beat later when the van goes, there s an AEL poster on the 
      wall.

      Rigsby runs the tape back.

      He points out that the first two digits on the licence plate 
      are visible.   

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    Which gets us a list of two 
                    thousand vehicles.  Look close at 
                    the back window...

      He points out in the van s rear window is a DECAL of a BEAR.

                                  CHO
                    Looks like a cat.  Or a dog.

                                  RIGSBY
                    It s a bear.  The Northwestern 
                    Oregon State Bear.  So Van Pelt 
                      cross-referenced that vehicle list 
                    with alumni of Northwestern Oregon 
                    State...

      Van Pelt brings up a LIST of five names ON a COMPUTER SCREEN.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Which gets us five names.  All 
                    clean, no criminal records, no 
                    animal rights activism, all living 
                    quietly in Oregon.  But... one of 
                    them sold his van six months ago to 
                    a company based in Sacramento. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    A company with no apparent business 
                    and no registered employees.  Based 
                    out of one of those warehouses by 
                    the river?  

                                  CHO
                    Nice work.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Lisbon s calling the SWAT now.


      Inside the warehouse is dark and cluttered; old machines loom 
      in the shadows, broken and rusted, and water drips from 
      somewhere, echoing.  The beams of the SWAT and CBI 
      flashlights illuminate GRAFFITI covering the walls as the 
      teams move cautiously through the building.  In the distance, 
      a GLOW of LIGHT PULSES from a doorway, the SOUND of 
      indistinct VOICES.  CBI and SWAT communicate silently by 
      means of hand gestures, and move into position.  Then, off 
      the SWAT Commander s slow and deliberate countdown: five, 
      four, three, two -- they blast into the room, amped, ready 
      for anything.

                                  SWAT & CBI TEAM
                    Freeze!  Police!  Hands where we 
                    can see them!  etc. etc.

      But they find that the Animal Equality League is ONE GUY in 
      ratty underwear, eating a microwave burrito in front of the 
      television, surrounded by CATS.  He stares up at them in 
      surprise.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      The Animal Equality League, or HOWIE DAUBERT, (40 s) as he s 
      more commonly known, sits in the bullpen, talking to Cho.  

                                  HOWIE DAUBERT
                          (bland monotone)
                    Yeah, I killed Nelson.  He had it 
                    coming.  And I m gonna kill Stutzer 
                    too, for what he s doing to the 
                    animals.  He s got it coming.

                                  CHO
                    What is he doing to the animals?

                                  HOWIE DAUBERT
                    Hey, can I go now?  I gotta feed 
                    the cats.  They get hungry, you 
                    know?  Then they get mad, and they 
                    pee on my computer keyboard, and it 
                    really screws up my work.

      Cho nods sympathetically.

                                  CHO
                    We won t keep you any longer than 
                    we need to.  This Animal Equality 
                    League, tell me about it.

                                  HOWIE DAUBERT
                    It s a league of people who believe 
                    animals should be equal.  To 
                    humans.  I m chair of the League s 
                    Supreme Council. 

      ACROSS THE ROOM, Rigsby watches with Van Pelt.  

                                  VAN PELT
                            (dismissive)
                    He s crazy.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Crazy doesn t make him innocent.  
                    Crazy is what makes people kill 
                    other people. 

      ON CHO AND DAUBERT:




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Red Brick & Ivy"     GRAY 12/05/08     23.

                    How did you kill Nelson?

                                  HOWIE DAUBERT
                    Poison.

                                  CHO
                    What kind of poison did you use?

                                  HOWIE DAUBERT
                    Wouldn t you like to know.

                                  CHO
                    I do know.  I m wondering if you 
                    do.

                                  HOWIE DAUBERT
                    Do you realize that the real rulers 
                    of this planet are insects?     

      Cho throws a weary glance to his colleagues across the room.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Okay.  Crazy innocent, probably.   

      Rigsby picks up the phone.


      Lisbon sits with Emily, who is talking on her cell phone.  
      Jane ambles around the room, picking things up, examining 
      them.  Emily gestures apologetically to Lisbon.

                                  EMILY NELSON 
                          (on phone)
                    Is three arrangements too few?  
                          (listens)
                    How much are the lilies?  Maybe you 
                    should speak to Chancellor Stern, 
                    he might have a better idea.

      She puts the phone down, turns to Lisbon.

                                  EMILY NELSON (CONT'D)
                    I m sorry.  Death is so 
                      complicated.  I m expected to 
                    answer all these questions about 
                      everything.

                                  LISBON
                    Mrs. Nelson, I --

                                  EMILY NELSON
                    Please, call me Emily.  I never 
                    really got the hang of being called 
                    Nelson. 

      She stops for a moment, overwhelmed by sadness at her 
      circumstances.

                                  EMILY NELSON (CONT'D)
                    I was just getting the hang of 
                    being a newlywed.  Now I m a widow.    

      Standing behind her, Jane takes in the whole room.  It is 
      decorated in clean modernist style, a bit severe, a bit cold, 
      everything just so.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Red Brick & Ivy"     GRAY 12/05/08     25.

                    Did you ever have the sense that 
                    there was anything wrong in any 
                    aspect of Alex s life? 

      Jane stops at a side table covered with framed PHOTOGRAPHS.  
      Pictures of Alex Nelson receiving awards, Alex with Lewis 
      Stutzer, Alex in the lab, Alex with Emily.  

                                  EMILY NELSON 
                    No, I don t think so.  I mean, work 
                    had been very hard recently, I know 
                    that. 

      Jane picks up the photo of Alex and Emily together.  Smiling, 
      happy on a beach somewhere a year or so before.  In the 
      picture, Emily s hair is not blonde and straight, but dark 
      and curly.

                                  JANE 
                    Is this you?

                                  EMILY NELSON
                    Yes.  That was when Alex and I 
                    first met.

      Jane puts the photograph back down.

                                  LISBON
                    Why was work so hard?

                                  EMILY NELSON 
                    I don t know.  When he would talk 
                    about his work I couldn t 
                      understand a word.  He gave up 
                    telling me after a while.  But he 
                    had an argument on the phone a few 
                    weeks ago.  Alex went into his 
                    office, and I heard him shouting he 
                    was so angry.  He never shouts.

                    Look at this, boss.

      From a baggie, Van Pelt lays out pieces of SEVERAL TORN UP 
      PHOTOS on a table.  Intimately romantic snapshots of Kerry 
      and Alex in a hotel room. 

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Found them in the kitchen trashbag. 

      If we saw the pieces together, it would be too racy to show 
      on air, but as a jigsaw, we get the idea without actually 
      seeing anything. 


      The team gathered to run the case.  The physical evidence is 
      laid out on a table.  A bag of pills.  The torn up photos.   
      The  forgive me  note.

                    The note is too brief for a woman.  
                    Women like to explain things.  
                    I think this is a staged suicide.

                    Perhaps she was too ashamed of what 
                    she d done to talk of it.

                    She had enough pills to kill

                    Hoarding pills is a characteristic 
                    of the suicidal type. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Yes, but why would she kill herself 
                    with hydrogen cyanide, with 
                    terrible pain, when she s collected 
                    pills that would let her slip away 
                    gently? 

                                  JANE
                    Maybe she wanted and needed the 
                    pain.  To punish herself for 
                    killing her lover.

                    No.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    You can save the lives of a million 
                    people if you are willing to kill 
                    one terminally ill person.  Yes or

      Sophie flips a switch, making the glass two-way.  Talks into 
      a mike.

                                  SOPHIE
                    That s it.  If you ll just wait for

                    can go.  Thank you so much for your

      Sophie turns to Jane and Lisbon.

                    Almost everyone answers the set of 
                    questions the same way.  It s the 
                    most basic human morality -- the 
                    value we place on a human life, and 
                    when we re willing to sacrifice it.  
                    But watch now.  If I run a current 
                    of electricity through this part of 
                    the brain...

      She indicates ON THE SCREEN.

                                  SOPHIE (CONT D)
                    I can provoke a response that 
                    totally bypasses any conscious 
                    thought.  

      She points to the computer in front of her, indicating TWO 
      COLOR BARS -- one BLUE, the other RED (similar to the left-
      right phasing on a stereo system) -- that are central to the 
      SCREEN, flanked by 3D BRAIN-IMAGING and COMPLEX-LOOKING 
      ALGORITHMS. 

                                  SOPHIE (CONT D)
                          (pointing to an algorithm)
                    I can manipulate the subject s 
                    moral reasoning.  Towards good...

      She turns to dial a small amount one way -- the RED BAR 
      INCREASES incrementally.  She turns the dial the other way, 
      and the RED BAR SHRINKS, while the BLUE BAR CREEPS UP.

                                  SOPHIE (CONT D)
                    And if I want, the reverse.  Toward 
                    evil.   

      She resets the dial to its base level.  

                                  SOPHIE (CONT D)
                    Obviously there are complex ethical 
                    issues involved, so we ve 
                      recalibrated the test subjects just 
                    enough to prove our findings.  We 
                    can t get too far ahead of public 
                      sentiment.     

      Jane turns the dial, and the RED BAR SURGES, while the BLUE 
      ONE SHRINKS.  

                                  JANE
                    But theoretically, this way,

      He turns the dial the other way, making the BLUE BAR INCREASE 
      and the RED ONE SHRINK.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    This way, saints.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Yes.  In simple terms.   

                                  JANE
                    I must have a try.  Let me have a 
                    try.

                                  JANE
                          (laughing)
                    You call them controllers? 
                      Brilliant.  I don t mind which I 
                    try.  I want to do both.

                                  SOPHIE
                    I m so happy we ve amused you. 

                                  LISBON 
                    Doctor Miller, I assume you heard 
                    about Kerry Sheehan s death.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Yes.  Tragic.  Do you think she 
                    killed Alex? 

                                  LISBON 
                    Where would be a good place for us 
                    to have a quiet talk?

                                  SOPHIE
                          (a cool smile)
                    That sounds ominous.  

                                  LISBON
                    We can talk downtown with lawyers 
                    present.  I thought it would be 
                    more congenial to talk here.

                                  SOPHIE
                    You re right.  And I m happy to 
                    talk.  I understand, you re just 
                    doing your job.


      Empty for lunch break.  Jane wanders.  Lisbon sits opposite 
      Sophie.

                                  LISBON
                    We were wondering, did you know 
                    Kerry was having an affair with 
                    Alex?

      Sophie considers her answer.

                                  SOPHIE
                    I knew she was having an affair 
                    with a married man.

                    Because she told me.  I didn t know 
                    it was Alex.  I didn t put it 
                    together.  

                                  LISBON
                    She told you though.  You were 
                    close then?

                                  SOPHIE
                    Not really.  

                                  LISBON
                    No?  She must have known you were 
                    Alex s ex.  Why would she talk to 
                    you of all people?

                                  SOPHIE

                    You re a psychiatrist.  Take a

                                  SOPHIE
                    My guess?  Because she was a silly 
                    little girl and she liked the 
                    secret drama of it all.  And the 
                    safety of the rules that would 
                    prevent me from slapping her 
                      senseless, if I d found out. 

                                  LISBON
                    Why would you have slapped her for 
                    that?  You don t care about Alex 
                    anymore.

                                  SOPHIE
                    I care nothing at all for him.  But 
                    I don t like to be played with. 

                                  LISBON
                    Were you still in a physical 
                      relationship with him?

                    No.

                    No problem.

      Lisbon goes.  Beat.  Jane and Sophie look at each other.

      FLASHBACK


      Jane sits alone at a table, playing a repetitive kid s game

      Long beat.  Jane watches her like a hawk.  Sophie turns pink. 
      She can t lie to Jane.

                                  SOPHIE 
                    No.  No.  We re this close.  We re 
                    this close to cracking it.  We re 
                    on the very edge of a revolutionary 
                      breakthrough. 

                                  JANE
                    On the edge.  Sophie, this 
                    building, this institute, this 
                    whole multi-million dollar project 
                    is based on a sham.  Yes or no?

      Sophie comes clean, deflating...

                                  SOPHIE
                    Yes.  It s a sham.  We ve been 
                      falsifying data for nearly a year 
                    now, to make it look like it works.  
                    But it doesn t.  

                                  JANE
                    Why lie about it?  It was bound to 
                    be discovered.

                                  SOPHIE
                    Pride.  Delusion.  Greed.    
                    You have to understand, Lewis 
                    Stutzer is a genius.  This project 
                    is the culmination of his life s 
                    work.  I so desperately wanted it 
                    to work.  We all did.  We began to 
                    believe the lies that we were 
                    telling. 

                                  JANE
                    Then Alex threatened to expose the 
                    whole thing.  

                                  SOPHIE
                    Yes.  He was going to do it at the 
                    symposium that morning.  He was 
                    going to confess.  I begged him not 
                    to.  Begged him.  It would mean the 
                    end of our careers.  The end of 
                      everything.  And there s still a 
                    chance that we might make it work.  
                    We might.

                                  JANE
                    So you killed him and Kerry to keep 
                    them quiet.

                    had nothing to do with their 
                    deaths.  Nothing.

                                  JANE
                    Who did it?

                                  SOPHIE

                    I don t know.

                                  JANE
                    You knew they were killed because 
                    of this cover-up and yet you didn t 
                    say a word.   

                                  SOPHIE
                          (in tears)
                    I was scared.

      Jane studies her.

                                  JANE 
                    This is why you asked for my help, 
                    isn t it?  You thought you could 
                    press my buttons and manipulate me 
                    into exonerating you.

      Sophie puts her head in her hands.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Sophie.  Look at me.  I don t care 
                    about the fraud.  But if you had 
                    anything to do with these murders...  

      Sophie starts to speak.  He silences her. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    If you had anything at all to do 
                    with these murders, now s the time 
                    to walk out of here and get on a 
                    plane to Brazil.

      Jane deliberately turns his back on her.  To give her the 
      chance to run.  

      FLASHBACK          THE MENTALIST     "Red Brick & Ivy"     GRAY 12/05/08     41.



      Jane, in his new uniform of crumpled suit and waistcoat, 
      shakes Sophie s hand.

                                  JANE
                    Good-bye, Dr. Miller.  Thank you,

      He walks away.

                    I had nothing to do with the murders.

      FADE IN:


      Minelli talks on his phone as he walks.

                                    MINELLI
                    No.  I don t like the sound of that 
                    at all.  That s a crazy idea.


      Jane on the phone.  The CBI team and Sophie watching him.

                                  JANE
                    Will do, boss.  Thanks.
                          (puts phone away)
                    He said go ahead, fine.  Nice idea.

      Off Lisbon s skeptical, but resigned look...


      Jane sits in the test subject s place with the electrodes in 
      place.

                                  SOPHIE
                    This is his baseline before re-
                      calibration.

      She shows Stutzer a GRAPHIC DISPLAY ON the COMPUTER SCREEN.  
      Taps at a keyboard...

                                    STUTZER
                    You re sure of this?

                    I ve checked and rechecked the 
                    results.  Watch.  I ll optimize 
                    moral clarity...

      Sophie taps at the keyboard and the BLUE BAR on the screen 
      climbs upward, as the RED BAR subsides.

      ON JANE: gazing at the rippling water on the glass wall while 
      the coolly disembodied female voice asks questions over the 
      speakers.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

      ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS: 

      She taps the keys again, the RED BAR starts to climb, while 
      the BLUE BAR falls... 

                                  SOPHIE
                    And now I ll push him toward the 
                    opposite end of the curve...

      ON JANE:

                    Question 98.  You are stuck on an

                    You see?  It works.

      ON JANE - A LITTLE LATER: 

      The questions continue.  Jane now has an evil glint in his 
      eye.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)

      Stutzer and Sophie have been joined by Chancellor Stern, who 
      pumps Stutzer s hand.

                                  CHANCELLOR

      INSERT: On the control panel, the all important RED BAR is  
      at full strength, the BLUE BAR nonexistent.  Jane is set to 
      maximum evil, so to speak.

      RESUME ON Jane as he comes through the door separating the 
      control room from the test room.

      Jane is followed in by Sophie, Stutzer, and Stern, all 
      somewhat anxious...

      Jane swivels abruptly and gets right in Stutzer s face.

                    -- No, Doc.  You don t understand.  

      Jane goes to the door, types a code into the keypad, and the 
      door LOCKS with an audible CLICK.

      Jane goes to the Professor s desk and takes out his gun, 
      expertly checks that s it s properly loaded.

                    Let s put your moral baseline to 
                    the test.  Question ninety-nine.  
                    Who killed Alex Nelson and Kerry 
                    Sheehan?  

                                    STUTZER
                    I, I don t know.

                                  JANE
                    That s not an acceptable answer.  
                    Tell me the truth, or I will kill 
                    that woman. 

      He looks over at Sophie, makes a small face to indicate  just 
      play along.   Neither Stutzer nor Stern can see this.

                                    STUTZER
                    I am telling you the truth.

      BAAANG!  JANE CASUALLY SHOOTS SOPHIE.  She falls like a log.          THE MENTALIST     "Red Brick & Ivy"     GRAY 12/05/08     47A.



      Lisbon, Rigsby, and Cho stand in the hallway outside the 
      office.  They don t react to the gunshot.  Rigsby unwraps a 
      stick of gum, offers one to Cho, who shakes his head,  no.  


      Sophie lies crumpled on the floor.  There s blood.  Stutzer 
      is speechless.

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN 
                    Oh my God.  Oh my God.

                                  JANE
                    Okay, now that we ve established 
                    real test parameters, tell me who 
                    killed Alex and Kerry.  Or I ll 
                    shoot your good friend here.  Then 
                    if you still won t answer me 
                    honestly.  I ll kill you.

      He puts the gun to the back of the Chancellor s head.  Stern 
      goes very still and shuts his eyes.

                                    STUTZER
                    My good man.  Please.  I can t tell 
                    you what I don t know.  

      Jane cocks the gun.

                                  JANE
                          (an edge to his voice)
                    I need an answer.

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                    It was me.  It was me.  It was me. 
                    I killed them. 

                                    STUTZER
                    What?  You?  Why? 

      The Chancellor looks over at Stutzer regretfully.

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                    I m sorry, Lewis.  I only wanted to 
                    protect you.

      Jane doesn t lower the gun, but his voice loses its angry 
      edge.

                                  JANE
                            (reasonably)
                    I need evidence.

                                  JANE
                    What s in the bottle?

                                  JANE
                    Why did you do it?  

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                    To protect the university.  Alex 
                    was going to expose the Stutzer 
                    Institute as a fraud.  The 
                      University s finances are based on 
                    Stutzer s reputation.  If he goes 
                    down, Leyland University goes down. 

                                  JANE
                    And Kerry came to you after Alex 
                    died and said Alex had told her 
                      everything.  She was going to 
                    expose Stutzer as not just a fraud, 
                    but a murderer. 

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                    Yes.

      Jane walks away now, to demonstrate mastery, like a matador.

                                  JANE 
                    Where in the basement is the 
                    charcoal lighter fluid bottle?

                    Top shelf on the left as you come 
                    down the stairs.

      Jane slips the gun into his pocket, unlocks the doors and 
      opens them to reveal Lisbon, Rigsby and Cho.

                                  JANE
                    Bet you keep a nice neat basement. 
                    What s in the bottle again?

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                    Cyanide.

                                  JANE
                    Sophie.  You can get up now.  

      Jane lends her a hand and Sophie gets up.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                          (to Lisbon)
                    You see?  The blood was totally 
                    worth it.  It s always that little 
                    extra detail that sells the whole 
                    thing.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Red Brick & Ivy"     GRAY 12/05/08     50.

      The Chancellor stares at Sophie in disbelief.  As 
      understanding dawns...

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                    It s all inadmissible!  I said what 
                    I had to say, to save myself from a 
                    lunatic with a gun.  It s 
                      inadmissible!

                                  JANE
                    We know.  But knowing the truth is 
                    important too.  Top shelf on the 
                    left or right did you say?

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                    Lef --

      Stern makes as if to go for the door, but realizes it s 
      futile. 

                                  LISBON
                    We have agents at your house now 
                    with a search warrant.

                                  CHANCELLOR STERN
                      Inadmissible.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes, I m glad I m not a State s 
                    Attorney.  Jane is always pulling 
                    this kind of crap on them.  But, 
                    they manage to win anyhow.  In the 
                    meantime, you re under arrest.  
                    Rigsby, would you?

      Rigsby puts the cuffs on Stern, and mirandizes him as he 
      leads him away.

      Stutzer looks forlornly to Jane and Sophie as he helps her 
      out of the BLOOD PACK GEAR. 

                                    STUTZER
                    The engine doesn t work.  You were

                      Pretending.  To catch the 
                      Chancellor.  Or me I suppose.  You 
                    couldn t know which.

                    No no.  Yes of course.  Clever of you.  I 
                    so badly wanted to believe it was true.  
                    So badly.  The mind plays tricks eh?

      Jane and Sophie saying goodbye at the door.

                    In the future, I hope your love

      Beat.  He leans in, kisses her on the cheek.  Sophie exits.

      Jane and Lisbon sit alongside each other.  She puts the keys 
      in the ignition and starts the engine, but doesn t take the 
      car out of park.
