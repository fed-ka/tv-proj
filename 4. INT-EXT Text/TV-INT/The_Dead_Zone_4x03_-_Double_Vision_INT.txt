          STREET - DAY)

          Milk, laundry, lightbulbs, etc.  Somebody's having a big
          day.  The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL:


          JOHNNY

          crossing items off his to-do list, his scrap of paper
          braced against the steering wheel as he drives.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I need... light bulbs... razor
                          blades... stamps...

          Johnny rolls to a stop at the light.


          AT THE LIGHT

          A hot little car pulls up alongside at the light.  The
          WOMAN behind the wheel makes brief eye contact with Johnny. 
            Striking, late twenties, there's something about her. 
          Johnny smiles politely.  She smiles back.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                          I definitely need one of those.

          Just when Johnny thinks he might have a little thing going
          here, her expression changes as she reacts to something
          beyond Johnny, a flash of concern crossing her face. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something I said?!

          The light changes and he starts forward into the
            intersection, when suddenly...


          BAM! A PEDESTRIAN

          Comes flying out of nowhere, running against the light,
            careening off Johnny's right front bumper.  The guy hits
          hard, a heavy gym bag absorbing the impact.  Johnny hops
          out to check on the guy, but he's already hurrying away.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey!  You okay?!  WAIT!

          The woman guns it, cutting Johnny off as she blows through
          the intersection.  We don't know it yet, but she's
            following that guy.

          Johnny watches both of them vanish into traffic, wondering
          if the whole world's gone mad. 


          DAY

          Crosshairs pan off a distinctive billboard, then begin
          floating from window to window of an office building before
          settling on a VICTIM, a MAN in a coat and brimmed hat.

          As the targeted man snaps open the window blinds, the
          gunman fires twice, hitting the intended victim, killing
          him instantly.

          The VISION PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS, pulling back through the
          scope to reveal the gunman, wearing the jacket, cap, and
          gloves of the PEDESTRIAN.  But when the gunman looks up
          from the scope and turns to reveal his face, IT'S JOHNNY,
          having a first-person vision.



          Talking to Johnny on the phone as he heads for the door.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  3.


    5CONTINUED:5

                                        WALT
                        Can you tell where the shots come
                        from?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't be sure.  Wait!

          Johnny sees THE MAN WITH THE BRIMMED HAT stride into the
          main entrance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, I see him.

                                        WALT
                        The shooter?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The victim.  I gotta go...

          Johnny heads into the building after the intended Victim.

                                        WALT
                        Johnny?  Hello?
                                  (frustrated)
                        I'm gonna have to stop takin'
                        these calls.

          He grabs his jacket and takes off.



          Johnny ducks into the lobby just in time to see the Victim
          slip into a crowded elevator as the doors shut. 



          As Johnny races up the stairwell.



          DING.  The elevator doors open, revealing the oblivious
          Victim with the distinctive hat.  He heads down the hall
          toward a large formal entry for "P.T.S. INSURANCE".

          Just as the Victim exits frame, a winded Johnny blows
          through the fire escape door.  He catches a glimpse of
          the entry door swinging shut.  He rushes for the door...          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  4.



          Upscale corporate waiting room, large enough for a
            RECEPTIONIST and a GUARD.  The receptionist buzzes Victim
          through the door to the inner offices.  Just as the door
          shuts behind him, Johnny enters through the outer door --
          and is stopped cold by the Guard.

                                        GUARD
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Can I help
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did a guy go by here wearing a
                        hat?

                                        GUARD
                        Do you have an appointment?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, there's something very bad
                        about to happen.  A man is going
                        to be shot.

          The Guard exchanges a concerned look with the receptionist,
          then subtly draws a canister of pepper spray.

                                        GUARD
                        I'm going to ask you to step
                          outside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't understand, there's
                        going to be a shooting...

                                        GUARD
                                (re: pepper spray)
                        I will use this...

          Johnny makes a bold decision.  He grabs a clipboard off
          the counter and holds it up as he reaches over and buzzes
          himself in.  The Guard blasts the pepper spray, which
          Johnny deflects with the clipboard as he rushes through
          the inner-office door.  The Guard coughs after catching
          some of the spray deflected back off the clipboard.



          As he rushes down the corridor checking each office,
          bumping into startled secretaries and office workers as
          he goes --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  Excuse me.  Look out!

          Then Johnny spots the Victim crossing the hallway at the
          far end of the corridor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mister!  You!  Wait!

          Before Johnny can move, he's pushed from behind and knocked
          down as SOMEONE rushes past him.

                                        WOMAN
                        Comin' through!

          Without stopping, she casts a curious glance back at
          Johnny, as he gets up off the floor --

                                        WOMAN
                        Sorry.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (taken aback)
                        You?

          It's the WOMAN from the car earlier.  She keeps moving.


          DAY

          As he zeros in on the MAN IN THE HAT, the intended Victim
          is suddenly knocked out of harm's way.



          Looking up from the scope, a single eye betraying surprise.



          Rush into the office as the intended Victim and his rescuer
          untangle themselves.  (We'll learn later her name is ALEX.)

                                        ALEX
                        You all right?

                                        VICTIM
                        What the hell is your problem?

          She attempts to straighten his crushed hat.

                                        ALEX
                        Your hat kind'a took a hit.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Everybody stay away from the
                          windows.  The gunman might still
                        be out there.

                                        VICTIM
                        Gunman?  Would somebody please
                        tell me what's going on?

                                        ALEX
                                (to Johnny)
                        You saw him, too?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who are you?

          The Guard hurries into the room.

                                        GUARD
                          Alright, both of you outside!

          The Guard hustles them both out into the corridor full of
          CURIOUS OFFICE WORKERS.  Alex scans the hallway ahead.

                                        GUARD
                        We'll see what the police have
                        t'say about this.

                                        ALEX
                        I'd love to stick around, but I
                        have a previous engagement.
                                (to Johnny)
                        See you later.

          She smiles, then bolts away up the corridor.  The Guard
          is too old and too slow to give chase.

                                        GUARD
                        I know what you look like, young
                        lady!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't suppose you'd consider
                        writing this off as a failed
                          security drill?

          The Guard slaps a handcuff on his wrist.

          FADE IN:


          Looking down into the window of the insurance agency, the
          room now empty, police tape visible across the door.  The
            viewpoint SNAPS BACK WIDE TO REVEAL:



          Johnny and Walt stand at the window in an empty floor of
          a building overlooking the insurance building.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is the same view from my
                        vision.  The shooter was here.

          He kneels down and runs his hand along the edge of the
            window...



          Crawling on the back of Johnny's hand.  He swats the bee
          off his hand, but it's just a vision, the scope of which
          widens to REVEAL:


          SAME ROOM - EARLIER

          Johnny is startled to find ALEX suddenly next to him,
          looking off through the window toward the insurance office. 
          Her look shifts, eyes fixed on the edge of the roof. 
          Still in the vision, Johnny follows her look, and sees:


          THE GUNMAN

          From his vision.  As the two of them watch (sharing a
          vision).  The gunman fires at the insurance building,
          killing the Insurance Executive.


          ALEX

          recoils in horror, looking away from the shooting as she
          turns toward Johnny.  SHE LOOKS STRAIGHT AT JOHNNY,
          reacting as if she sees him.

                                        ALEX
                        Who are you? 

          A voice distracts her.

                        Hey!  You can't be in here!

          It's the manager, finding her earlier that day.  As she
          spins to look at him, THE VISION ENDS.



          Johnny finds himself back with Walt and the Manager,
            wondering what the hell that was.

                                (puzzled)
                        When he shot the man in the
                          Insurance building.

                                        WALT
                        But he never fired that shot.

                        In my vision he did.  Something
                          changed. 

          Off their stumped looks.



          Johnny and Walt step out of the empty office, pausing as
          the Manager locks the door behind them.

                                        WALT
                                (to the manager)
                        Thanks for your time.

          He shakes the manager's hand.

                                        MANAGER
                        No problem.  And it was a pleasure
                        meeting you, Mr. Smith.

          He reaches out to shake Johnny's hand.  Johnny reluctantly
          shakes, triggering:

                        I was looking for someone.  A man
                        with a black gym bag?

                                        MANAGER

                        just come this way.

          The Manager takes Alex by the arm and starts walking away
          as THE VISION FREEZES.  Vision Johnny walks around the
          frozen Alex, studying her.  The Manager was right.  She
          is unbelievably hot.

          Then something beyond her catches Johnny's attention.


    17C17CJOHNNY'S POV - STILL IN VISION

          His view crashes in on the distant fire escape door, where
          The Gunman, also frozen in the vision, watches Alex and
          the Manager through the crack of the open door.  Vision
          Ends.

          Johnny comes out of the vision looking toward the door.

                        He was here.  The gunman.

          Walt and the Manager follow Johnny over to the fire escape
          door, now shut.

                        He was watching the whole time...
                        he touched this door.

          Johnny reaches out, touching the door where he saw the
            shooter's hand holding the door open, triggering:

                        I don't know.  He's got a fuzzy
                        bear on his stethoscope.

                                        WALT

                        This sounds crazy, but it's going
                        to happen... I know it.



          Alex jumps in.

                                        ALEX
                          Cross-town.  Hotel Soleil.

                        No wait.  Go east.

                                        CABBIE
                        Yes, ma'am.  East.

          They turn and drive on, then...

          The cabbie adjusts his rearview mirror slightly to keep a
          better eye on his odd passenger.


          MOVING - DAY

          Meanwhile, Johnny walks through a parking garage, scanning
          the parked cars, looking for something.

          Her car is parked right next to a staircase exit.


          GARAGE - DAY

          Johnny looks inside her car, finding generic clutter. 
          CANDY BAR WRAPPERS, CD'S, ETC.  Something tucked under
          the windshield wiper catches his eye, a parking stub for
          a HOTEL SOLEIL VALET.  He takes the stub, touching the
          car, triggering:


  2828VISION - JOHNNY STILL TOUCHING THE CAR

          Johnny hears bounding footsteps approaching from inside
          the stairwell door.  He straightens himself briefly, then
          sits back against her car, waiting for --


          ALEX

          Who bursts out of the exit door and runs smack into a
          waiting Johnny, to her shock and dismay.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (smugly)

          THE VISION ENDS.



          Comes out of the vision, back at the instant he touched
          the car, Alex yet to arrive.  He steps over to the
            stairwell door, but as he's about to touch it, he HEARS
          her approaching footsteps.  Stepping back, he straightens
          himself just like in the vision, then sits back against
          her car to wait for her to come through the door.



          As she bounds down the stairs, oblivious to Johnny waiting
          for her.  She reaches the bottom of the stairs, extending
          her hand for the door, but when she touches it, she stops
          cold.



          Her on one side, him on the other.  Her thoughtful, him
          smug.  We see her hesitate -- does she sense Johnny's
            presence?

          A silent beat passes.  Johnny starts to get worried when
          she doesn't come through the door like he saw.  He steps
          up to the door, carefully touching it.  In the split screen
          we see them on both sides of the door, frozen, "listening".



          Starts to open the door, but stops when he notices:


  3333BEES (VISION)

          Pouring out from under the door.  Without warning, a swarm
          rises up around him, and the vision MATCH MOVE MORPHS TO:


          GARAGE - DAY

          He comes out of the vision, the swirl of bees vanishing
          as he gets his bearings.



          Johnny drifts over to the restaurant, trying to look
          nonchalant as he checks out the well-dressed clientele.

                        hard sometimes.  It's my cross to
                        bear.  I'll be good, I promise. 
                        Just don't go.  Please.

          He sees her for the first time.  The real her.  He slips
          the coat back on and sits down.

          She extends a hand to Johnny to shake, he hesitates.

                        Can't we just enjoy each other's
                        company for a little while?

          Johnny doesn't admit it, but he'd also like to have a
          nice lunch without dealing with the harsh reality of his
          life.  He nods.

          calm --

          She explores onward, each step deeper into the house

    4242FLASHBACK OF HER VISION - STREET CORNER - THAT MORNING

          We see a silent visual of what she describes.

                                        ALEX (V.O.)
                        I was coming out of a store when
                          I bumped into this man.  When I
                        turned around, there was this boy
                          standing there, crying, saying
                          something about how his Daddy
                        needed help.  I waited with him
                        until the man returned, but when
                        I asked about it, he looked at me
                        like I was crazy, and when I turned
                        around again, the boy was gone.

          The flashback ends on Alex's concerned look as the man
          gets in his car and drives away.

          Johnny takes a beat to puzzle things out in his head.

                        So the boy was really a vision?

                        It's always a little bit different. 
                        Usually it's connected to an

                        idea?

          He obviously doesn't, as he slowly reaches for her hand,
          but...

                                        ALEX
                        Wait...

          She hands him the epi-pen.

                                        ALEX
                        When I was a kid, my big sister,
                        Anne, used to tell me if you die
                        in a dream, you'd die in real
                        life.  Just in case.

          Johnny takes the epi-pen in one hand, reaching out to her
          with the other.

          She kisses him passionately, as the connection triggers:


  4444VISION - UNDER A BLUE SKY - DAY

          Alex breaks the kiss and steps back from Johnny, both of
          them finding themselves under a deep blue sky full of
          spectacular white clouds.  (The sky goes from horizon to
          horizon, the ground beneath them dark and shadowy.)

          A sound draws Johnny's attention, and he looks over to
          see...


          VISION ALEX

          Looking up at the blue sky, oblivious to Johnny.  Feeling
            something wet, she raises her hand and sees that it's
            bleeding.  She wheels around, looking right through Johnny. 
          Her breathing becomes labored, her hand going up to her
          throat, tearing at her collar as she tries to get more
          air, coughing and choking with shock induced asthma.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT TWO - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  29.

          Johnny's first thought is the epi-pen, and he looks down
          to the hand he's holding it in, but it's gone.  In a
          reflex, he pats himself down wondering where it went,
          then realizes this is a vision -- and there's nothing he
          can do but watch as Alex begins turning blue from lack of
          oxygen.

          She struggles to stay standing but can't, falling to her
          knees, then the ground, her body wracked by spasms as she
          desperately tries to draw a last breath, the anaphylactic
          shock sealing her throat shut.

          Johnny kneels at her side, unable to help her, but still
          wanting to stay close.  He watches as she dies, her body
          convulsing, then growing still, her eyes lifeless.

          Hearing something he looks up and sees:


          ALEX

          Watching from a distance as Johnny kneels over her dead
            vision-self.  Horrified she turns to run, Johnny calling
          after her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex!  Wait! 

          But his voice is drowned out by the sound of BUZZING. 
          Johnny looks down toward the sound coming from vision-
          Alex, just in time to see a SWARM OF BEES burst out of
          her mouth, engulfing Johnny, ENDING THE VISION.

          Johnny fights off the last of the bees as they evaporate
          around him, leaving him back in his living room, Walt
          shaking him out of the vision.

                        The doctor we're looking for has
                        a small stuffed animal on his
                          stethoscope.  A bear.

                        You mean, like this?

          His stethoscope has a little red Elmo attached to it.

                                        CHIEF OF MEDICINE (CONT'D)
                        This is a children's hospital,
                        all of our doctors decorate their
                          stethoscopes.

          Johnny is distracted by something he sees beyond the man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What the hell..?

          JOHNNY'S POV

          As Alex comes through the front entrance -- alone -- moving
          across the lobby and into the elevator.


          JOHNNY

          takes off after her, seeing her step onto the elevator
          just as the doors close.

                                        WALT
                        Johnny?



          As Alex rides up, she's no longer alone in the elevator,
          the Little Boy still with her, a resolute look on his
          face.



          Watch the floor indicator climb to the sixth floor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was Alex.  She must be here
                        looking for the shooter.

                        You wait for the elevator, I'll
                        take the stairs.

          Walt exits for the stairs while Johnny nervously punches
          the call button.



          With the Little Boy still leading the way,  Alex passes a
          sign near the elevator -- Pediatric Neurology Ward.

          As Alex and the Boy walk along, she begins to hear
          whispering and muffled laughter.  CHILDREN begin to appear,
          stepping into the hallway, dressed in hospital pajamas --
          at first in ones and twos, but soon a small PARADE of
          sick kids begin to follow her, surrounding her and tugging
          at her, vying for her attention, laughing.  (It's strange,
          not like a scene from a horror movie).  She tries to shush
          them...

                                        ALEX*
                                  (whispering)
                        Go back to your rooms, go on now...
                        you'll wake up the others...

          The Boy continues pulling Alex along through the growing
          crowd.   As she passes each open door we see the real
          patients in their respective beds.


          THE DOCTOR WITH THE FUZZY BEAR

          on his stethoscope, from Johnny's vision, steps out of a
          room down the hall, smiling at Alex as he turns to continue
          his rounds.  He doesn't seem concerned about the kids. 
          That's strange.


          ALEX AND THE BOY

          The Boy, seeing the DOCTOR up ahead, doubles his efforts
          to pull Alex along, but the crowd of kids surrounding her
          is too much. 

                                        ALEX
                        What is it?  What do you want
                        from me?            DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT TWO - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  34.


          NIGHT

          Johnny jumps out and immediately sees Alex, halfway down
          the OTHERWISE EMPTY HALLWAY.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex!

          She looks back at him, fear in her eyes.  He runs to her,
          finding Alex pressed against the wall, trying gently to
          get herself away from something he can't see.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's going on?  Is it the boy? 
                        Is he here?

          She extends a hand to Johnny -- TRIGGERING --


          Sharing Alex's vision, Johnny suddenly finds himself
          surrounded by these children -- now desperate for attention
          from him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My God, who are these children?

                                        ALEX
                        They're patients.  I'm reacting
                        to their emotions... their fear
                        and their desperation...they're
                          reaching out to me...

          Johnny extricates himself from the crowd of kids, following
          the Boy as he leads him down the hall and through a doorway
          into one of the hospital rooms where Johnny sees...


            (REALITY)

          Using his fuzzy bear stethoscope to check a bed-ridden
          child. 


          HOSPITAL)- NIGHT

          The gunman watches the same scene from a different
            perspective.  As the doctor steps away from the kid and
          moves toward the window, Johnny is already on the move. 
          Just as the crosshairs find their target, Johnny kills
          the lights, dives for the doctor, knocking him down.          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT TWO - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  35.



          Spooked, he turns to go.



          Johnny holds the doctor against the wall.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You okay, Doc?

                                        DOCTOR
                        What's going on?  Who are you

                        Johnny!  Johnny, come quick!

          Johnny joins her on the other side of the room where he
          finds Alex standing over a patient on a ventilator.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's wrong?

                        It's him.  It's the boy from my
                        vision.

          Johnny looks down and sees the Little Boy lying peacefully
          in the bed.

          Johnny considers her frustration, then gently reaches out
          and touches Charlie's head, the way only a father imagining
          his own son would.  He shakes his head.

                        It's alright, take your time.

                        Once he was declared brain dead,
                        the insurance company refused to
                          continue paying for his care.

                                        MRS. MUNROE
                        It was thrown out of court.  Our
                        last hope was arbitration, but we
                        lost.  That's when Frank snapped. 
                        I've never seen him so angry...
                        so hopeless.

                        Do you know where he is?

          She shakes her head "no."

                        We appreciate your time.

          Walt and Johnny start to leave, then...

                        Would it be alright if I looked
                        at Charlie's bedroom?

          Mrs. Munroe seems surprised by the question.  So do Walt
          and Johnny.  She's uneasy, but...

                                        ALEX
                        It might help.



          With Johnny, Walt, and Alex behind her, Mrs. Munroe opens
          the door TO REVEAL that the room has been trashed,
            Charlie's belongings destroyed in some kind of rage.

                        I came home from church on Sunday
                        and found it like this. 

          Johnny steps into the room, touching the debris,
          triggering:



          The father (our gunman), berserk with grief, nearly
          finished destroying his son's room.  He drops to the floor,
          drunk, angry, spent and ultimately weeping.  It's tragic
          to watch.



                                        JOHNNY
                        Your husband was here. 

          Mrs. Munroe breaks down and exits, Walt following.

                        Not anymore.

          Johnny begins working his way around the room, passing
          his hand over the debris, looking for visions.

            Something catches her eye, distracting her.  A small
          crucifix on the floor.  She picks it up, gently setting
          it on a table.  Turning her attention back to the room
            something new catches her attention --  another crucifix,
          up on the wall.  She reacts, "Was that there before?" 
          Now she notices a statue of the Virgin Mary.  And another
            crucifix.  The room seems suddenly full of icons.

          visible is the crucifix Alex set on the table.  Alex looks

          Johnny and Alex enter, joining Walt and Mrs. Munroe.

                        Not since Charlie was hurt.  Frank
                        said any God who'd let a child
                        suffer like that didn't deserve
                        to be worshiped.

          She shows them a photograph on the refrigerator.


          TIGHT ON THE PHOTO

          A first Communion picture of Charlie and his parents posing
          with a smiling priest, FATHER ANDREW.

                                        MRS. MUNROE (O.S.)
                        This was taken at Charlie's first
                        Communion.  After the accident,
                        Frank begged Father Andrew for a
                          miracle.  He was consumed with
                        rage when the miracle didn't
                        happen.

          Johnny takes the photo, running his finger along an
          inscription on the back from Father Andrew: "Best wishes,

          A small group of PARISHIONERS pray as a PRIEST approaches
          the alter to begin services.  The VIEW CONTINUES on,
          finding FRANK MUNROE sitting in the back row of the church,
            kneeling, seemingly in prayer.  He makes a final sign of
          the cross, then stands, picking up the gym bag as he walks
          unseen to the staircase that leads to the balcony.

          FADE IN:


          Walt, Johnny, and Alex slip through a side door at the
          back of the church, moving very carefully as they keep an
          eye out for Munroe.

          All three are startled when the back door opens behind
          them, another half-dozen Parishioners arriving for mass.

          confused Parishioners back outside.  Alex is quietly
          focused up on the stairs.



          Alex sees the Little Boy at the top of a nearby staircase. 
            Oblivious to everything else, she follows the Boy up the
          stairs, drawn by the power of her vision.


          As they struggle to deflect a growing number of PEOPLE
          from entering the church without making a scene.  Johnny
          turns back to check on Alex, just in time to see her turn
          the corner at the first landing, disappearing around the
          bend as she continues upward.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex?

          Johnny follows after her, leaving Walt behind.  By the
          time Walt turns around, Johnny and Alex are gone.



          Up the stairs, moving cautiously as she reaches the doorway
          to the balcony.  She looks out across the balcony, finding
          it empty.  Then she sees,



          Peeking at her from inside a sanctuary off to the side of
          the main balcony.  As soon as she sees him, he turns and
            continues on, disappearing deeper into the sanctuary.



            Following Charlie, compelled by the vision.  Unafraid,
          she enters the sanctuary.



          Alex finds herself in a small windowless room, lit entirely
          by a large display featuring hundreds of devotional
          candles, each one representing a prayer for the dead.

          She looks around the small room, but Charlie is nowhere
          to be seen.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  47.

          Behind her, a shadow moves, darting out of the sanctuary --
          Frank Munroe.  Suddenly, the door slams shut, locking her
          inside.  She tries the door.  It's locked.  As she turns
          back to face the candles and size up her situation, we
          can see the panic growing in her face as it becomes harder
          and harder to breathe.  She realizes she's having a
          reaction to something.  Something big.



          Reaching the balcony door.  He pushes the door open and
          sees...


          Munroe kneeling at the edge of the balcony, his gun resting
          on the railing as he FIRES three quick shots.  Turning
          away from the carnage below, he sees Johnny, and raising
          his gun FIRES -- ending what we now know is a VISION.



          He comes out of the vision, taking a beat to regain his
          composure.  A noise draws his attention toward the
            sanctuary door where he sees...


          FRANK MUNROE

          Hunkered down on the floor, beginning to assemble his
          gun.  Behind him, the door knob to the sanctuary RATTLES.


          JOHNNY

          Ducks back out of sight to think, considering his lack of
          options.



          As the candles continue to burn brightly around her, Alex
          tries the lock again, driven by a desperate need to
          breathe.  In a burst of panic and frustration, she shakes
          the door violently, clawing at the lock, cutting herself
          in the process.

          She looks down at the gash in her hand, and for a moment,
          forgets about breathing when she realizes the cut in her
          hand is just like the one in her recurring vision.

          As she looks up from her hand, the asthma-like attack
          comes back with a vengeance.  She knows she doesn't have
          long before she passes out, dropping to her knees, knocking
          over some of the candles as she goes down.  The room spins
          and she finds herself on the floor, looking up at the
          ceiling, reacting with awe at what she sees.


          ALEX'S POV - A DARK BLUE SKY WITH WHITE CLOUDS

          The blue sky from her vision turns out to be a fresco
          painted on the domed ceiling of the sanctuary.


          ALEX

          Lips turning blue from lack of oxygen, she sees:


          A CANDLE ON THE FLOOR

          with an unmistakable honeycomb pattern in the wax.  The
          label on the bottom of the candle reads: "100% real
          beeswax" above a honey bee logo.


          ALEX

          Looks at the cut on her hand, the ceiling, the candles --
          and somehow has the presence of mind to shake her head at
          the irony, even cracking a smile through her agony.  If
          she could draw a breath, she'd laugh.  Fortunately, now
          that she knows what the problem is, she has a solution,
          reaching into her pocket for her epi-pen.

          But it's not there.  She checks and re-checks her pocket,
          the smile gone from her face as she thinks back...



          She sees herself hand the epi-pen to Johnny.

          Johnny peeks through the balcony door, watching as Munroe
          calmly finishes assembling his rifle.  Munroe sits on the
          floor with his back against the sanctuary door.

          From where he is, Johnny can see the Mass down below as
          well.  He notices Walt below, pulling people quietly out
          of harm's way.

          Johnny looks back at Munroe who finishes loading his rifle,
          gets up and starts to cross the balcony.  Johnny can see
          that Munroe will get there before everyone is safe below.

          Thinking fast, Johnny fishes into his pocket, coming up
          with a handful of change.  Just as Munroe is about to
          discover Walt speaking to Father Andrew at the alter,
          Johnny throws his handful of coins off into the shadows
          at the back of the balcony.  The loud noise distracts
          Munroe, turning him around.


          JOHNNY

          Reaches into his pocket and comes up with another handful
          of coins, and something else, the epi-pen, triggering:



          Johnny watches as Alex gasps her last breaths on the floor. 
          He notices the cut on her hand and the beeswax candles,
          then follows her gaze up past him to the ceiling, seeing
          the blue sky as the VISION ENDS.



          He comes out of the vision and looks to the sanctuary
          door, now knowing Alex's dire condition -- but Munroe is
          still between Johnny and her.


          MUNROE

          Still looking in the direction of the noise, satisfies
          himself that nobody is there, then finishes his walk to
          the edge of the balcony, just in time to see the last few
          people hustled out the door by Walt and Father Andrew.

          MUNROE

          angered and confused by his lack of targets, retreats
          from the edge of the balcony, crossing back toward the
            sanctuary door, cocking his gun.  As he reaches for the
          lock...


          JOHNNY

          has no choice, jumping out into the open, his hands in

                        still loves you, he doesn't want
                        you to die.

                                        MUNROE
                        That some kind of sick joke?

          He raises the rifle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hear me out.  The woman you locked
                        in that room.  She came here
                        because Charlie asked her to.

                                        MUNROE
                        My son is dead...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't believe that.  I don't
                        think you do either.  His body,
                        his flesh might seem dead, but
                        his heart is still alive. 


          Barely alive, her lungs convulsing in tiny shallow breaths,
          but her eyes still react to Johnny's remark.  Then
            suddenly, she stops struggling and her eyes soften as she
          sees something.

          It's Charlie.  Alex's eyes follow him as he kneels down
          next to her and whispers in her ear.



          Still squared off outside in the balcony.  Johnny keeps
          inching forward as they talk.  Walt appears behind Johnny,
          just out of Munroe's line of sight.  He draws his gun,
          ready to shoot if he has to.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you're angry.  I have a
                        son Charlie's age.  If the world
                        turned its back on him, I'd do
                          whatever it took to keep him safe.

                                        MUNROE
                        He's just a kid.  Insurance company
                        turned him out.  Doctors want to
                        pull the plug... even God looked
                        away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But she didn't.  She saw him
                        exactly like he was.

                                        MUNROE
                        Who?




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  52.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The woman behind that door.  She's
                        a psychic, Frank.

                                        MUNROE
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know it sounds strange, but
                        it's true.  She sees people in
                        pain, people in the darkest times
                        of their lives.  She saw Charlie. 
                        He led us here... to you.

          Munroe wrestles internally.

                                        MUNROE
                        Why should I believe you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Open that door.  You're going to
                        find my friend on the floor. 
                        Dying.

                                        MUNROE
                        How?

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's having an allergic reaction
                        and she needs this medicine.

          He holds up the epi-pen.

                                        MUNROE
                        Why should I listen to you?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Because, if she dies, she'll never
                        be able to tell you why Charlie
                        sent her.

          Munroe considers things, his eyes filling with tears...

                                        MUNROE
                        He was such a good kid.  It
                          shouldn't have happen to him, it
                        should have happened to me.

          Slowly lowers his gun, just slightly, keeping it trained
          on Johnny as he opens the door behind him.

          Inside, just like Johnny said, he finds Alex on the floor,
          barely hanging on as she looks up at him.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  53.

                                        MUNROE
                        Can you hear me?

          Munroe searches her desperate eyes, thinking a beat before
          turning back to Johnny.

                                        MUNROE
                        All right.  Give it to her.
                                (then louder)
                        But you try anything, I'll kill
                        you both.

          WALT

          Stealthily approaching from the other side of the balcony,
          cocks his gun, inching forward for a clean shot.



          Rushes to Alex's side.  He pulls the cap off the epi-pen
          with his teeth and jabs it in her thigh.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I bet you thought I forgot
                        about you?  It's okay... just
                        relax and let it do its job.


          ALEX

          Goes rigid, every muscle in her body contracting as the
          epinephrine courses through her veins, purging her blood
          of the bee allergen.  Almost instantly, she sucks in a
          huge breath as her throat begins to open.


          MUNROE

          Watches Alex come back to life, his gun still pointed at
          Johnny.

                                        MUNROE
                        She okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think so... thank you, Frank.

          Alex nods yes, then looks to Munroe, grabbing his leg. 
          She works hard to speak between gulps of air.

                                        MUNROE
                        What's she saying?

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  54.

          He eases down close to listen, as Alex fights to speak.

                                        ALEX
                        Charlie... wanted to tell you...
                        don't be sad... he's okay... will
                        see him again someday...

          Munroe considers this for a beat, then raises his gun
          angrily.

                                        MUNROE
                        You think I'm somekind'a fool?

          Walt appears behind Munroe, but Johnny raises his hand to
          keep him away.

                                        ALEX
                                (still fighting for
                                air)
                        He said he's sorry...  about your
                          camera...

          Stunned, Munroe can't seem to move.

                                        MUNROE
                        My camera?...  How could you...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Camera?

                                        MUNROE
                        I got it for my birthday.  Charlie
                        took it without asking.  He had
                        it around his neck when he fell
                        through the ice. 

          Munroe finally breaks down.

                                        MUNROE
                        I just want him back, that's all. 
                        I just want my little boy.

                                        ALEX
                        He knows that.  He knows how much
                        you love him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me the gun, Frank.  Let's
                        end this before somebody get's
                        hurt.

          Frank slowly offers the gun to Johnny.  Walt deftly arrests
          Frank, who offers no resistance.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  55.

          Johnny kneels down next to Alex, who looks up.  Above
          them, a beautiful blue sky full of white clouds, frozen
          in time, their power over her gone.

                                        ALEX
                        I've never seen a more beautiful
                        sky.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, it's one of kind alright.



          Charlie remains suspended between life and death, his
          mother sitting at his side, rubbing his hand lovingly.

          The VIEW WIDENS to reveal Johnny and Alex, standing across
          the bed from her.

                                        MRS. MUNROE
                        I want to thank you for what you
                        did for Frank.  He's not a bad
                        man...

                                        ALEX
                        I know.

                        What about Charlie?

                                        MRS. MUNROE
                        I've decided I'm not going to
                        sign those papers.  Not after
                        everything that's happened.  I
                        just don't know how I'm going to
                        get up every day and face this.

          She heads for the door...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Munroe?

          She stops and turns.  Johnny steps to her and gives her a
          hug, taking a moment to whisper something in her ear.

          Alex wipes tears from her eyes as Mrs. Munroe looks up at
          Johnny, smiling and patting his hand.

                                        MRS. MUNROE
                        Thank you.

          She walks away.  As Johnny glances back at Alex.
