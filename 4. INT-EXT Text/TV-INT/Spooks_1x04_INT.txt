 
  TOM is taking the last piece of dressing from his wound, 
  looking at it in the mirror. 
  Suddenly ELLIE is behind him looking at the wound. She is 
  appalled. 
 
  A beat as she takes the sight in. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    Oh my God. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        It s not as bad as it looks. 
 
  Ellie turns away and leaves the doorway.

  TOM is still in the bathroom, looking at his wound. Then 
  he moves. He takes up two packets of dressing. ELLIE 
  appears. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                          What did you say you did? 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Fell on a stapler. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                A sort of industrial strength stapler. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                It is a whopper. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            It s a gun wound isn t it. Someone shot you.

                                Don t be silly. 
 
    A burning, angry look from her, directly into his eyes 
  via the mirror. 
 
  He cannot keep this up. He feels the inevitable is very 
  near - he s going to tell her. 
  She looks down at the wound. Suddenly she is worried she 
  will break down and cry. She takes the packets of medical 
  dressing from his hand. 
 
 
  General POV from above. The bathroom looks as 
    claustrophobic as a prison cell. They won t get out of 
  here until the truth is told. 
 
  TOM is sitting on the loo lid. He s turned sideways. 
  ELLIE is sitting on a laundry basket. ELLIE finishes the 
    bandaging. 
 
  Both their backs are curved. She feels she s a little 
  girl waiting for bad news and hates it. 
 
                                        TOM 
                Once I tell you, there s no going back. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                      So what are you? A gangster?

  He blinks. His world just changed.

                                I work for MI5. 
 
  She s not quite taken it in.

                It s a job, with an office, there s a 
            canteen, there s a pension, it s not out of 
                                the ordinary...

                    Look let s have a cup of tea ... 
 
  She interrupts. The questions flood into her mind. It s 
  like discovering he has been having an affair. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              Why were you at the restaurant? You were 
                                  always there. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  I fancied you. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              No, why did you come in the first place? 
 
  He always knew she d be razor sharp when he told her. 
  It s agony for him to own up to anything. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              There was ... An op. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  Op? What, some spying thing? At my 
                      restaurant? What was it about? 
 
                                        TOM 
                            I can t tell you that.

                                        TOM 
            Don t expect me to go against my training. 
 
  She is getting angry. 
 
  ELLIE 
  Your training? 
 
  And TOM finds himself heated. Defending himself.

                                        TOM 
              It s routine, when officers form liaisons. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Great! And now you know I m not Bin Laden s

                                        TOM 
            I was scared that if I told you, you d leave. 
            I want to be with you,Ellie. Everything flows 
                                    from that. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              No everything flows from can I trust you. 
                            (Sudden realisation.) 
                        Is Matthew your real name? 
 
  A pause.

                                        No. 
 
  ELLIE stands, now in tears. She rushes from the bathroom. 
  TOM sits there.

                                      (to ZOE) 
              A big fish like this, we must have had a 
                briefing paper about what he was up to. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Danny ... 
 
  HARRY is approaching fast. Quickly DANNY puts the file in 
  the locker. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Fun on the Bush demo? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      A doddle. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      (Frosty.) 
                      I want a report. In one hour. 
 
  HARRY sweeps off to go to talk to someone on the edge of 
  the Grid. ZOE and DANNY follow him with their eyes,                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 12
 

    nervously. 
 
  DANNY pulls open a drawer, slaps a big catalogue on the 
  desk, takes out a credit card. Lifts telephone. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              What are you doing? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          There s this DVD player - 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        But they stopped your card. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                            They ve upped my limit. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          How did you wangle that? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                There are ways. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Danny!... 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                (into telephone) 
                Hello, I ve ordered from you before, my 
                      customer reference number is... 
 
  And HARRY s back. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    We ll do it verbally. Now. Come. 
 
  ZOE and DANNY look at each other with dread. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                I ll ring back. 
 
  CUT TO: 
 
  The view from TESSA s Station. She is flanked by members 
  of her team. HARRY going into his office followed by ZOE 
  and DANNY, who are displaying  about to be whipped  body 
  language. 
 
                                        TESSA

                  What have the kiddiwinks been up to? 
 
  The acolytes snigger. 
 
 
  ELLIE is sitting looking at an Inland Revenue envelope. 
  The flowers from episode 3 are in the background. 
 
  TOM comes in, doing up a shirt gingerly over his 
  dressing. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Matthew Archer got a tax demand this morning. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  It s not real. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                            Don t spies pay taxes? 
 
                                        TOM 
          The Inland Revenue run a special office so no 
                            one can trace us ... 
 
  The phrase gets ELLIE. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
             Trace you.  Can I  trace you?  What is it? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  What is what? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                Your real name! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Tom Quinn. 
 
  ELLIE s nerve goes. She s breathless. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                    I can t handle this, I can t ... 
 
  She throws her head back. She is laughing through her 
  distress. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT D) 
              My boyfriend s turned into someone else. 
                            (Clicks her fingers.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 14
 

                                Just like that. 
 
  He goes to her. She pushes him away. 
 
 
  ZOE, DANNY and HARRY. 
 
  HARRY leaves them standing before his desk. He slips 
  three photographs across the desk - taken from high up - 
  of PETER SALTER in his flaming helmet, making a break out 
  from the police cordon. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              What happened there? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        He broke out of the cage. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Did he? Well well. Any idea who he is? 
 
    A horrible moment. DANNY and ZOE are desperately trying 
  to read the signals. ZOE is about to speak but DANNY 
  finds himself saying: 
 
                                        DANNY 
            Sorry Harry we had no idea Peter Salter was 
                                      undercover. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                            We weren t briefed ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Let me just tell you, you didn t see Peter 
                                  Salter today. 
 
    A moment s bewilderment. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
          You would be in very hot water if it had been 
          him. A very well-respected officer, on a demo 
                            without authorisation? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            I m sure it was him he was on the tapes ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  I have viewed the tapes and you were 
                            mistaken. Weren t you? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 15
 

                                        DANNY 
                                      Oh. Yes. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              And your operatives in the crowd all did 
                                        well? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Tremendous. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    (Laughs dryly, pointing at another 
                                    photograph.) 
            Poor young Jeff Catty, with a penguin on his 
            head. Anyway well done. Go and write it up. 
 
  DANNY and ZOE are stunned. DANNY can t believe they ve 
  not been roasted. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      That it? 
 
                                        HARRY 
          What do you want? My tongue down your throat? 
 
  1726 
 
  ZOE sits at her desk. DANNY in deep thought. He takes the 
  Salter file out of his locker. 
 
  His dialogue is in his head. 
 
                                  DANNY (V.O.) 
                        The brilliant Mr Salter ... 
 
  He begins to read. The words are in his head. 
 
                              DANNY (CONTD. V.O.) 
                Recruited at Oxford to GCHQ. Trained for 
                      advanced computer code breaking. 
 
 
  DANNY s voice over the scene. 
 
  The flat is squalid. Hardly anything in it. Mattress, 
  sleeping bags, clothes on the floor. Dim - no lights on. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 16
 

  PETER SALTER is looking out of the window by the edge of 
  a drawn blind. He doesn t touch the blind. He is relaxed 
  but highly alert, his features calm, his gaze still. 
  Behind him the other side of the small room ANDREA sits, 
  looking terrified. 
 
                                  DANNY (V.O.) 
              Volunteered for MI5 service 1977. Commended 
            for bravery, operation  Burnt Field  Belfast 
              1978 ... Blah blah ... ... Seconded to MI6 
                    1985-89 ... Fly me to the Moon... 
 
  PETER turns away from the window. 
 
                              DANNY (V.O. CONTD) 
            Returned to us ... 1992. Recruited following 
                                  officers ... 
 
  Peter is touching Andrea s face, she is looking up to 
  him. 
 
  1729 
 
  DANNY, still looking at Peter Salter s file. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
            Zoe what s going on, why s Harry saying he 
            wasn t there? ... (indicating the file) You 
                        know Salter recruited Tom? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Tom doesn t talk about how the Service got 
                        him, it s one of his things. 
 
  DANNY looks at the telephone on his desk. 
 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              How did you join? 
 
  TOM sighs and turns away. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT D) 
                            Won t say, can t say? 
 
                                        TOM 
                        (Aware how lame he sounds.) 
                All that matters is us. Here and now. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 17
 

                                        ELLIE 
                              (Cod brightness.) 
                Great. So in this  here and now  I stop 
              calling you Matthew and call you Tom. I ll 
            change my name too. Call me ... Pussy Galore. 
 
                                        TOM 
            I ve told you I do a job serving my country, 
                                is that so bad? 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
          What about Maisie? Are you going to tell her? 
 
                                        TOM 
                    It can be difficult with kids ... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            I can t have her lied to. Not after what she 
            went through with her father. Tell Maisie or 
                                    I leave you. 
 
  His mobile rings. 
 
  1733 
 
  DANNY at his desk on the phone. ZOE is biting her nails 
  beside him. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Matthew. Chris. Fancy a quick drink? Very 
                                        quick? 
 
 
                                        TOM

                              DANNY (V.O. PHONE) 
                            Great. See you there. 
 
  He rings off. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                I ve got to go. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  Was that them?

                                        TOM 
                      No I m just going for a drink. 
 
  The cover lie came out before he thought. She knows it. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                            You d better go then. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    I ll tell her. I will. I promise. 
 
  ELLIE looks at him, hard. 
 
 
  TOM has just been debriefed by DANNY and ZOE. He looks 
  furious. 
 
                                        TOM 
            And there was no briefing that he was on the 
                                        demo? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            No. Harry wanted us to forget it, but it was 
                                      odd ... 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        Right. Nail everything down. 
 
  TOM gets up, jaw marbling with tension. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              This could be tasty. 
 
 
  TOM. Straight in. Slams door. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Why was Peter Salter undercover without me 
                                      knowing? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            You are on sick leave. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  I run Peter. That is set in stone.

  ZOE is leaning over a basin, washing her hands. 
 
  TESSA bursts in. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              So what s going on? 
 
  ZOE looks at TESSA, nervous. 
 
 
                                        HARRY 
          All right. I m running Peter on a special op. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      What op? 
 
                                      A pause. 
 
                                        HARRY 
          How is Ellie? You know her vetting flagged up 
                                  positive ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Don t do that Harry. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    (Innocence.) 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Threaten me with career damage. Ellie was on 
              a women reclaim the streets march in 1992. 
                              (contempt.) Please. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      (Charm.) 
                  I m just trying to make you go away. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Well I won t! Peter went off piste on the 
            demo, didn t he? You didn t know he was going 
                              to blow his cover. 
 
  HARRY hesitates. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
              Turn him over to me. He s mine. I run him 
            because I know him inside out. I m not giving                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 20
 

                          you a choice here, Harry. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                (A light sigh.) 
            Oh when shall we lay down our burdens? (And 
                            hard-edged.) All right. 
 
  Takes a folder from his desk. Opens it. Flicks a 
    photograph to TOM. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      (Stunned.) 
                                  Istvan Vogel? 
 
  TOM looks at the photograph. We see a surprisingly young, 
  slight, open faced, blonde, a white shirt and tie, 
  smiling into the camera. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                That was in his Dusseldorfer Bank days. 
            Before he got religion. If world anarchy is a 
                                      religion. 
 
  Flicks another photograph. It s a spectacular shot of 
  Vogel - in jeans - a javelin thrower s pose about to 
  unleash a flaming petrol bomb. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                He s in England? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            The great wizard himself is with us, leader 
          of the leaderless group  Global Anarchy , who 
            would scorch the earth and not leave a bank, 
              American hamburger joint or stock exchange 
                                      standing. 
 
  HARRY has enjoyed his aria. He leans back in his chair, 
  hands behind his head. 
 
                                        TOM 
              And he s here to strike against the Bush 
                    visit? What, a Genoa style riot? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Or worse. That is the thought browning 
                        trousers in Downing Street. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          Do we have any idea how? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 21
 

                                        HARRY 
                                      Not yet. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        How close is Peter to him? 
 
  HARRY makes a finger and thumb sign:  very very close.  
 
                                        TOM 
            Sod you Harry! How could you keep me out of 
                                        this? 
 
  For a moment HARRY assesses the situation, staring at 
  TOM. Then makes up his mind. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            You weren t in for a very good reason. Which 
                    will immediately become apparent. 
 
  He lifts a red telephone. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      Get me Jools Siviter at MI6. 
 
  A look of horror at the name comes over TOM s face. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          (Again, the thin smile.) 
                                      Oh yes. 
 
 
  JOOLS sweeps through the shop to a room at the back. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              All quiet on the Western Front, Mr Patel?

                                        JOOLS 
                  Excellent. Shut up shop now I think. 
 
                                      NEWSAGENT 
                                Yes Mr Siviter.

                                        HARRY 
                                  What is this? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              The treat I mentioned old man. We ve been 
            bugging an anarcho s flat but something else 
                                has wandered in. 
 
 
  There is a radio operator - speakers - recording 
    equipment. Also a drinks fridge - whisky - ice. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                So they re home.

                                      OPERATOR 
                                      Yes Sir. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                            Talking? Rumpty-tumpty? 
 
  The operator turns up the speakers. Love cries. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                          Yes thank you very much. 
 
  The sound is turned down. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          Jools! What is going on? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              The girl your Peter Salter s making waves 
              with, well she s using the flat of an old 
                comrade of hers, German, and would you 
              believe our luck? That s where Peter s been 
                  giving her the benefit of his vast 
                                      experience. 
 
  A big grin from JOOLS. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    (Incandescent.) 
            You are conducting surveillance of one of my 
                    officers in the field? Without my 
                                    authorisation? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          Gift horse old man they walked in through the 
              door and the mikes were all there. Most of 
                  what we get is a non-stop bonkfest. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  Does Peter know the flat is bugged?

  PETER s voice over the speakers. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              (He s very worried.) 
                    Does Peter know the flat s hot? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            You are muscling in on my officer! You want                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 26

              Well actually there s not that much real

                        Gents let s have some hush! 
 
 
  ANDREA and PETER lie naked on the mattress. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                    MI5. You re MI5. What am I doing? 
 
  She turns away, pulling a sheet around her. She is about 
  to speak then doesn t. She tries again. 
 
                                        PETER 
                        It s the danger. It s sexy. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
            Danger. Oh yeah ... I ve just discovered I ve 
              been shagging a secret policeman for two 
                                      months. 
 
                                        PETER

                                  No. Just ... 
 
  She gets up and moves away, curling up on the battered 
  armchair, not looking at him. 
  He bides his time. 
 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Who s the girl? 
 
                                        JOOLS

  JOOLS flips photographs onto the table. TOM looks at them 
  as HARRY fills him in. 
  THE PHOTOS: ANDREA is smiling - a formal studio shot. In 
  another she s riding a horse in a country lane. In a 
  third she is partying in Hello magazine in a skimpy 
  frock. In a fourth - obviously shot undercover with very 
  fast film - naked young people dancing round a fire 
  before a tepi. An arrow points out ANDREA, arms raised 
  joining others, head thrown back laughing.

            Seems Anarchists these days get their totty 
                    from Cheltenham Ladies College. 
 
  TOM looks again at the first photograph: a beautifully 
  groomed, blonde young woman. 
 
 
  ANDREA looks up. She pushes her hair back. She looks at 
  PETER. She turns on him. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
              I trusted you. I told myself I was in love 
              with you. I introduced you to my comrades. 
 
                                        PETER 
                This is my life, I m putting it on the

                              (right back at him) 
              YOUR life? Because of my connection with 
            Istvan, I m on every police computer, I can t 
          see my parents or my friends because they may 
            be watched, I can t even use my real name. 
          When I go through an airport check in, I m so 
            scared I m almost dead. But that s OK. I ll 
            pay the price for what I believe in. I will. 
            But I m not going to end up betrayed by you. 
 
                                        PETER

                                      destroy. 
                                  (Throaty now.) 
              I want to be with you. I want to be one of 
          you. I ve learnt something from you. There is 
                              a world elsewhere. 
 
 
  They are mesmerised. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                    Is that a quote from something? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Shakespeare, Coriolanus. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                            (Genuinely impressed.) 
            One hell of a pitch I must say he is very, 
                                    very good. 
 
                            ANDREA (ON SPEAKERS.) 
                                  Just hold me. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              How do these bastards in the field do it? 
 
  JOOLS laughs. But TOM is very concerned. He is about to 
  say something - angrily - but PETER is speaking again. 
  They are all stunned by PETER s next sentence on the 
  speakers. 
 
                              PETER (ON SPEAKERS.) 
                      Tell Istvan I want to see him. 
 
                            ANDREA (ON SPEAKERS.) 
                                  No he won t. 
 
                              PETER (ON SPEAKERS.) 
          He will. Tell him I ve got a dead ground map. 
                            For the whole country. 
 
  All the listeners are galvanised by this. 
 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                          What s a dead ground map?

  She turns aside. She is uncertain what to do. 
 
                                        PETER 
                  All the major government buildings, 
            installations communications, military sites 
            ... The map shows where CCTV cameras miss.

            You could raid anywhere in the country. You 
                                      could ... 
 
  He stops. He is staring at a lamp. He lifts it. 
 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                        Did he clear this with you? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Of course. He s right on game plan. 
 
  HARRY catches TOM s eye. HARRY has just lied and TOM 
  knows it. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Bloody imaginative for you Harry must say, I 
                    hope you ve thought it through. 
 
  HARRY is about to reply but the Operator interrupts. 
 
                                      OPERATOR 
                              We just lost a bug. 
 
 
  PETER puts a finger to his lips. He looks around the 
  flat. He looks at an electric point on the wainscot. He 
  goes to it, crouches down. Then he s moving quickly. 
 
                                ANDREA (CONT D) 
                            What s happening? ... 
 
  He waves at her to be quiet. He goes to a cupboard. He 
  finds the electricity meter. He switches it off. He goes 
  to the electric point. He stamps on it with his heel. 
 
 
                              PETER (ON SPEAKER.) 
                  Good night sweet ladies, good night.

  A crunch on the speaker. JOOLS and HARRY look appalled. 
  TOM turns away with a very worried look. 
 
 
  PETER has a bug in his hand. 
 
                                        PETER 
                              Whose flat is this? 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                  It was Horst s ... A German comrade. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                      German. 
                                      (Sighs.) 
                      Am I getting sloppy or what? 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                  Is that MI5? 
 
                                        PETER 
                  No, this ll be down to the Sisters. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                    The ... ? 
 
                                        PETER 
            MI6. If there s been a foreign national here 
              who s been a naughty boy they d have been 
                                    bugging him. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
              MI6 have been listening to everything in 
                          here? To us making love? 
 
                                        PETER 
                      You ve got to be cool, right?

                      Oh God, I ve had people here.

            No. No he s not in London. I ve got to ... I

  And she rushes to the sink on the other side of the room. 
  PETER waits for a moment, then goes to her. 
 
 
  CLOSE UP: TOM s face. 
 
                                      OPERATOR 
                    Most of the living room s down. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              (Low, to himself.) 
                                Peter, Peter ... 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                              (Loudly, to Harry.) 
          Well if your bloody officer is going to wreck 
              one of our hot houses it s going to be on 
                                your budget ... 
 
  A noise over the speakers. 
 
  The sound of vomiting. A moment as they listen, appalled. 
 
 
  ANDREA, still at the sink, goes to speak. PETER shakes 
  his head, switches on a noisy fan heater, then helps her 
  back to the bed. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
              I never thought it would be this horrible. 
 
                                        PETER 
                Destroying the evils of world capitialism 
                    in t going to be a game of jolly 
                  hockeysticks. Now are you all right? 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                  (Gripping her.) 
                          I said ARE YOU ALL RIGHT! 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                YES YOU BASTARD! 
 
                                        PETER

  He leans to her. He speaks very low, his head beside 
  hers. 
 
                                        PETER 
              I want to meet Istvan. ASAP. He s here for 
                    the President s visit, isn t he? 
 
  ANDREA shakes her head. 
 
                                        PETER 
                            (Scribbling on a paper.) 
          Tell him about the dead ground map. I ll give 
                                    it to him. 
 
  He gives her a piece of paper. 
 
                                        PETER 
          Go to this address. You ll be safe. I ll come 
              and get you. Right, we ll get out of here 
                                      separately. 
                                      (Grins.) 
                                    Old habits. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
          New for me. I still don t know if I can trust 
                                        you. 
 
  He embraces her and kisses her hard. She responds, then 
  as he holds her tight, pulls back a little. 
 
                                        PETER 
                            I ll prove it to you. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                        I love you, so you better. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        Go. 
 
  He opens the door and she slips out. He closes the door 
  and leans back, closing his eyes: oh god, he s thinking, 
  I am in so deep... 
 
  He waits a moment. Then he goes quickly to the sink, 
  turns off the fan heater and finds the mike. He shouts 
  into it.

  The operator pulling off his headphones with a cry. 
 
 
  The restaurant is full but the atmosphere is calm. ELLIE 
  is relaxing drinking a glass of wine. The phone rings. A 
  waiter answers it. 
 
                                        WAITER 
                                    Who is it? 
                          (Listens. Then to ELLIE.) 
                              Someone called Tom. 
 
  ELLIE waits a moment then shakes her head. 
 
                                        WAITER 
                              Sorry she s tied up. 
 
  ELLIE sips wine. 
 
 
    Concourse. PETER is sitting on a steel bench. TOM sits 
  down beside him. 
 
                                        PETER 
                          Hiya Tom how you doing? 
                                      (Smiling.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 34
 

                          Moved Harry over did you? 
 
  TOM plays along with his tone. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Something like that. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Watch it old son. Don t get too good at the 
                                office politics. 
 
                                        TOM 
                               Look out, not in.  
 
                                        PETER 
            Salter s rule to preserve the sanity of the 
                                      officer. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      I remember. 
 
                                        PETER 
            I should hope you bloody well do. After all, 
              I perverted you to the service of the crown. 
                                  (He laughs.) 
 
  PETER s trying far too hard assert father s rights. Tom 
  is embarrassed. He goes to efficiency mode. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Where s the girl? 
 
                                        PETER 
                            In the Camden B & B. 
 
                                        TOM 
                Peter, the game plan Harry gave you was 
            simply to be undercover. Work the girl. You 
                      have gone way, way off piste. 
 
                                        PETER 
              Oh come on. These may be anarchists but 
            they re tight as an old style Leninist cell. 
            A normal cover game couldn t give me a spit 
              in hell s chance of getting anywhere near 
            Istvan Vogel. I mean we re all con men in t 
                we? So what s the hook I ve got to con 
                              Istvan? Me. My soul. 
 
                                        TOM 
              And offering him the national dead ground                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 35

                      That s the cherry on the top. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        Where did you get it from? 
 
                                        PETER 
            Oh ... A pretty little thing I know in the 
                                Ordnance survey. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        You ll have to turn it in. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                  PETER (CONT D) 
              Hang about, am I under some kind of cloud? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        PETER 
              Let me guess: Harry s getting grief from 
            Vauxhall Cross  cos I m not doing things by 
                                  the book ... 
 
                                        TOM 
              No. I mean you ve started a turf war, but 
            they re dazzled by Istvan Vogel as the prize. 
                      You are the hero of the hour. 
 
                                        PETER 
                            So what s the problem? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Me. It s me. 
 
  A beat. Peter looking at him, smiling but watchful. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
            You re in love with the girl. You blew your 
                                  cover for her. 
 
  PETER pauses. The strain suddenly shows. He wipes his 
  face with his hand. 
 
                                        PETER 
              Yeah, well. I hear you ve got a new girl.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 36
 

                              Have you told her? 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                    (Melancholy.) 
                  You have to, don t you? In the end. 
 
                                        TOM 
            The big difference is Ellie is not a target 
                                on an operation. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                  I know. I ... 
                            (Desperate to explain.) 
          Yeah yeah Andrea s posh and has knocked about 
            a bit, and I m her bit of rough. Maybe that s 
                what got us together. But ... she s a 
              believer, Tom. That s what s so beautiful 
                            about her. Her purity. 
 
  TOM reacts badly. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Oh Peter, please! How many in our trade have 
                                fallen for that? 
 
                                        PETER 
                    I m not fallen. I m just in love. 
 
  TOM sighs and looks away. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Peter, Peter ... 
 
                                        PETER 
                                  Believe me Tom. 
 
  A beat. TOM is in two minds. He tries to clear his 
  doubts. 
 
                                  PETER (CONT D) 
            I am so close. When I do bust Istvan Vogel, 
              Harry, Jools, all of you will be buzzing 
            round the honeypot. Then the service can put 
          me in the dead file and retire Andrea and me. 
                    A little fruit farm or something. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 37
 

                                        TOM 
                                        OK. 
 
                                        PETER 
                I can operate independently? My style? 
 
                                        TOM 
                          When have you ever not? 
 
  PETER floods with relief. 
 
                                        PETER 
                Great. There s got to be an end to it 
                                      somewhere. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      To what? 
 
                                        PETER 
                            Obedience to the state. 
 
  TOM is electrified by the phrase. PETER is at once aware 
  he has made a mistake. A moment - then TOM makes a 
  decision. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    I m closing this operation down. 
 
                                        PETER 
                              You can t do that. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  We ll go back to Thames House. Now. 
 
                                        PETER 
              Fuck you! They could get to Bush! You want 
              him humiliated on British soil, or worse? 
 
                                        TOM 
                              You are stood down. 
 
                                        PETER 
                The pupil knifes the master, eh? What s 
                          happened to you? Ambition? 
 
                                        TOM 
                          (Hating this. He stands.) 
                          You re losing it, Peter. 
 
  PETER looks deflated. He is playing for time. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 38
 

                                        PETER 
            Maybe we all do in the end. Tom, let me see 
                                  her tonight. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                I can t do that. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                      (Pleading.) 
          I ve got to try to roll her over. Get her out 
            of that set up before she wrecks her life. A 
                            favour for the master? 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        TOM 
            First thing tomorrow morning. Thames House. 
                        Expect to be there all day. 
 
                                        PETER 
                Jawohl mein Gruppenfuhrer. Tom. Thanks. 
 
  TOM does not reply. He goes. 
 
  PETER sits, sprawled on the metal seat, eyes alert, 
  thinking hard. Then he stands and goes quickly toward the 
  escalators. 
 
 
  TOM sits opposite HARRY. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        How did the debriefing go? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  I pulled him. 
 
  A pause. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        (Low.) 
                                    You what? 
 
                                        TOM 
                              He s not reliable. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                The great Peter Salter is not reliable? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 39
 

                                        TOM 
              It was the way he said  Obedience to the 
                                      state.  
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    What way? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Like a believer. 
 
  They look at each other. Dare they discuss this? Neither 
  can decide. The subject of defection is too horrible. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                I hope I m wrong. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      So do I. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Where is he right now? 
 
                                        TOM 
                          (Stretching a weary body.) 
          The Camden B & B. Danny and Zoe are watching. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Right, tell me everything he said to you. 
 
  TOM stretches a weary body and is about to begin. 
 
 
  Way beyond weariness, TOM let s himself in. He goes into 
  the living room. ELLIE is asleep in the chair. The wine 
  bottle is empty. 
 
  He gets a blanket and puts it over her. She stirs but 
  does not wake. 
 
 
  He goes into MAISIE s room and checks: she s asleep. He 
  closes her door and sags. 
 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 40
 

  ZOE and DANNY are observing a bed and breakfast, eighty 
  yards away. There are other cars parked in the road. 
 
    A silence. 
 
  Zoe blows out air, bored. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
                    Was there a cashpoint back there? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    What is it about you and plastic? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            The shrink explained it. When I m unhappy I 
                        have this urge to get money. 
 
  ZOE ignores this, looking away. But DANNY is in a mood to 
  tease her. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
                              Earl grey teabags. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        What? 
 
                                        DANNY 
              You didn t get any. Just one little thing 
                      making me unhappy, that s all. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                Why should I get you earl grey teabags? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                  I like them. 
 
  A beat. They look out. A man in the street. He stumbles. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        No. 
 
  They relax. 
 
  But ZOE - who is at heart a serious woman - has risen to 
  DANNY s teasing. 
 
                                        ZOE 
              We have a flat share. We are not married. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 41
 

                                        DANNY 
                  Is Earl Grey teabags married life? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Oh yes. 
 
  They start. PETER SALTER has just crossed the road in 
  front of them. He is approaching the B & B. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              He s going into the girl. Note the time. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    (Stroppily.) 
                    Thank you, Mr. Good-housekeeping. 
 
 
  A narrow staircase. He runs up it. Knocks on a door. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                      It s me. 
 
  ANDREA opens it. 
 
 
  A dismal room - faded, greyish, floral. 
 
  PETER goes straight to the window. He does not touch the 
  curtains. He looks out sideways. He hands ANDREA a 
  mobile. 
 
                                        PETER 
              What time did they say they d pick us up? 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                        1.30. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Right. Ring 999. Ask for police. Tell them a 
                man and a woman are having sex in a BMW 
              Estate in the Horlworth Road, Camden, and                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 42
 

                          there are children about. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                        What? 
 
                                        PETER 
                    It s better with a woman s voice. 
                                  (Very sharp.) 
                                    Just do it! 
 
 
  ZOE and DANNY cannot escape from their row about the 
  flat. He s not teasing anymore. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          It s just about putting knickers and stuff in 
                              the drawer Zoe ... 
 
  A police car has pulled up. POLICEMEN get out quickly. 
  One knocks on the window. DANNY lowers it. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Sod. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
            (Heavy flashlight. Through the open window.) 
                        We ve had a complaint, Sir. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Complaint? 
 
  The POLICEMAN shines the light onto DANNY s crotch. He 
    instinctively covers himself. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                  There are children about you know. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      What at one o clock at night? 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                            Now don t get funny. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Danny! 
 
  They look through the windscreen. With ANDREA on his arm 
  PETER SALTER is walking briskly away from the B & B. Not 
  looking back he raises a hand with a wave.

                                      POLICEMAN 
            Could you please arrange your clothing and 
                          get out of the car, Sir. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      My clothes aren t unarranged! 
 
                                        ZOE 
                            We are MI5 officers. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                                Oh yes, madam? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              (Slamming the wheel.) 
                                  Fuck you fuck! 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
              Right that s it! Out of the vehicle NOW! 
 
 
                                        HORST 
                                      Mobile? 
 
  PETER takes out his mobile and gives it to him. 
 
                                  HORST (CONT D) 
            Thank you. If you were I, what would you ask 
                      me ... To ask you to do now? 
 
  HORST smiles. PETER takes out a CD Rom. He holds it in 
  his teeth then he begins to take off his clothes. 
 
  CROSS FADE TO: 
 
 
  PETER has taken off all his clothes. The car is cramped. 
  Elbow in HORST s face. 
 
                                        HORST 
                              (With a flashlight.) 
                                      Please? 
 
  Then he looks in PETER s ears and ruffles his hair. 
 
                                        HORST 
                                      And ...? 
 
  PETER turns around on the seat. HORST inspects his anus. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 46
 

                                        HORST 
                          Thank you. Put these on. 
 
  He hands him a blanket and a parka and Wellington boots. 
  PETER takes the CD out of his mouth. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Who taught you to sweep for bugs like that? 
 
  HORST smiles. 
 
                                  PETER (CONT.D) 
            Felt very Bundesnachrichtendienst. Great on 
                checking people s arseholes, the German 
                                Secret Service. 
 
                                        HORST 
                              (Cod German accent.) 
                        Ve are only obeying orders. 
 
                                        PETER 
                      You a defector too, are you? 
 
  A glint of steel - even hatred - from HORST. 
 
                                        HORST 
                                (To the Driver.) 
                              Over there! There! 
 
  He s handing the clothes and the mobile over to ANDREA. 
  She gets out of the car quickly. 
 
 
  ANDREA gets back in and the four wheel drives off. They 
  drive on for a moment. 
  PETER is interested in HORST. He tries to rile him. 
 
                                        PETER 
                          So, we going to kill him? 
 
    A horrible silence from the group. 
 
                                        PETER 
            The President of the United States when he                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 47
 

            visits in five days time. We going to pop him 
                                      or what? 
 
  HORST stares at him. His manner has now changed. There is 
  hate and suspicion in his eyes. 
 
                                        HORST 
                          We ve a long way to go. 
 
  Horst takes out a blind fold. Peter shrugs. 
 
 
  TOM is sitting hunched on the bed, his mobile to his ear. 
  No reply. He rings off. 
 
 
  ELLIE waking with a start. The telephone is ringing. She 
  realises she has been covered with a blanket. 
 
  She lifts the telephone. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        Hello? 
 
  A moment. Then there is HARRY s voice. 
 
                                  HARRY (PHONE) 
                        Is Matth ... Is Tom there? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  Who wants him? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Could you ask him to give Harold a ring? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        No. 
 
  She puts the phone down. 
 
  She waits. 
 
  TOM comes into the room. Shorts, t shirt, sleepy. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 48
 

                                        TOM 
                              Was that the phone? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        Dunno. 
 
  He looks at her. Then he walks back into the bedroom. She 
  waits. Alert eyes on the bedroom door. 
 
  She hears TOM on his mobile in the bedroom. 
 
                                    TOM (O.S.) 
                          Yeah my mobile was off. 
                                  (A moment.) 
                                  Right. Thanks. 
 
  Rings off. 
 
  TOM comes back into the room. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            Oh God Ellie, look ... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    (Interrupting.) 
                                      At what? 
 
                                        TOM 
                        I m sorry, I ve got to go. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            It s six-twenty in the morning. When did you 
                                      come in? 
 
                                        TOM 
                            I don t know ... two? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              You said you went out for a drink with a 
                                      friend. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            I ve got to shower ... 
                            (Indicating his wound.) 
                                  And do this. 
 
  He turns away. 
 
  A LITTLE LATER: 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 49
 

 
  The bathroom again ... TOM s truth cell. 
 
  TOM has showered and has just got the dressing on. 
  Shaving gel on his face. A steamy atmosphere. 
 
  ELLIE comes in. Bathrobe, carrying a mug of coffee. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT D) 
                                  Who is Harold? 
 
  TOM stops shaving. He s running on empty. 
 
                                        TOM 
            If someone rings me, with a message, it will 
            be important. So please, just tell me what 
                                    they say. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Or what? It ll be the Tower of London and an 
                            electric shock machine? 
 
  TOM closes his eyes, holding the sides of the basin. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT D) 
            You re going to have to tell me once what you 
            do, in detail, all of it. Just once. Then... 
                I dunno, then maybe we ll be in with a 
                                      chance. 
 
  TOM says nothing. ELLIE leaves the bathroom. 
 
 
  PETER s POV: darkness. Breathing. 
 
  Then the blindfold is ripped off. Sunlight pale through 
  the tinted glass. Trees. 
 
                                        HORST 
                          You ll need the wellies. 
 
  The car door is opened. There are young men and women 
  standing around. All in serious weather clothes. 
 
 
  ANDREA and PETER get into the van. ISTVAN VOGEL and two 
  others - male and female - are inside. VOGEL is slight, 
  neat in the country clothes of the group. He has a lap 
  top computer open on a small camping table. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 51
 

                                        ISTVAN 
                    The English secret pig policeman. 
 
                                        PETER 
          The loony anarcho enemy of the world order. I 
                                      presume. 
 
  A smile from ISTVAN - not unlike HARRY s thin smile. He 
  has authority. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
          Mr. Salter, agents of state security services 
          have attempted to penetrate our group before. 
                          We have dealt with them. 
 
                                        PETER 
                      But did they all bring gifts? 
 
  He produces the CD. ISTVAN takes it and puts it into the 
  laptop. He is eager to look at it. 
 
                                        PETER 
                So what s the plan for the Bush visit? 
 
    A hesitation amongst the others in the van. But ISTVAN is 
  fixated on the laptop screen. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                                    Tell him. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
            We re going to occupy the Mall. So Bush can t 
              drive up it to the State Banquet with the 
                                        Queen. 
 
                                        PETER 
                  Special Forces will mash you to bits. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                      We are not afraid of a fight. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                  What good... 
 
                                        ANDREA 
            We ve found out where a gas main crosses the 
                  Mall. Westminster Council offices. 
 
  Smirks all round. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 52
 

                                        ANDREA 
            We just need to hold out long enough to dig 
                          down and set it alight. 
 
  PETER is contemptuous. 
 
                                        PETER 
              And you think that s a wonderful wheeze? 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
          The disruption will be bigger than Stockholm. 
                                    (of laptop) 
              Extraordinary. Look. The CCTV protection for 
              where we may all end up ... the Tower of 
                                      London. 
 
  They all laugh. PETER is disgruntled. 
 
 
  The grid is in the grip of an electric atmosphere. 
  Everyone is looking at or trying not to look at the 
  window of Harry s office. Inside HARRY, TOM, JOOLS and 
  ZOE are all standing, moving around. 
 
  DANNY comes out of a pod, bounds over to HARRY s office, 
  knocks and opens the door. 
 
    Simultaneously: 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                      (Shouting.) 
                  ... Mad Hatter s fucking tea party! 
                                        HARRY 
                              (Shouts at Danny.) 
                              Not you! Get out! 
 
    Shell-shocked, DANNY steps back closing the door. He 
  looks across the Grid to TESSA and her acolytes who are 
  on full alert. He shrugs  what s going on?  
 
  TESSA shrugs back  no idea.  
 
  DANNY goes to his desk. As he sits, ZOE comes out. She 
  comes and sits down at her desk. She takes a deep breath. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                        They re going to blame us. 
 
  ZOE, anxious, looks across at TESSA and stands ... 
  ... as HARRY s door opens. The blazing JOOLS shoots out                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 53
 

  straight to the pods. TOM comes out - also at speed - 
  over to the station with files. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    Tom sorry  bout last night I ... 
 
  TOM is locking the files up in the locker above his desk. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Harry wants you. 
                                      (Snaps.) 
                                        Now! 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Right. 
 
  TOM hurries after JOOLS and they step into the pods. 
 
  DANNY looks across the Grid. ZOE and TESSA are making for 
  the woman s loo. 
    Cautiously DANNY makes his way to HARRY s door and 
  knocks. 
 
                                  HARRY (O.S.) 
                                        Yes! 
 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Harry, about losing Salter last night ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    (Interrupting.) 
            This isn t about that. Have you got them on 
                                        you? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Er ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              Your credit cards. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        What? 
 
  HARRY is still flushed with the fury of the meeting he 
  has just been in. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              I wanted you to work it out Danny, get it 
            through your system, this thing you have with                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 54
 

            money. Particularly money you don t have. We 
              all have our little quirks and I suppose 
                  ingenious theft - like breaking into 
              computers to set your own credit ratings? - 
                isn t such a sin in our trade. It s an 
              impulse that could be creatively channelled 
            with brilliant effect. Sadly in your case it 
          has not been - yet. BUT I am going to protect 
              you. Because of Mr Salter, in the next few 
              days we will all be in the spot light. The 
            menders will be sent in to vet us even to the 
              back of our eyeballs. So you are owning up 
                                now. Aren t you? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Yeah. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Then give me the cards you bloody idiot. 
 
  HARRY takes a pair of scissors out of a drawer. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    Oh. Right. 
 
  HARRY clacks the scissors. 
 
 
                                        TESSA 
              And now they ve lost Salter! And over at 
                    Vauxhall Cross they ve gone potty. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Yes ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  (She laughs.) 
                        My oh my. That is lovely. 
 
 
  HARRY has cut DANNY s credit cards into neat squares. 
  DANNY - still standing - has had to watch this. 
 
  HARRY sweeps them into an envelope and drops the envelope 
  into drawer. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Punishment. Office ... Staff ... Training. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 55
 

                                        DANNY 
                    No, Harry, please, no, not that. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          For as long as it takes. 
                                  (He stands.) 
              Punishment reforms. Or the kind I dish out 
                                        does. 
 
  With a sigh DANNY turns and opens the door. HARRY looks 
  through the window. 
 
 
                                        TESSA 
              And all for the love of an Anarchist from 
                          Cheltenham Ladies College! 
 
                                        ZOE 
            I don t know if I should be telling tales ... 
 
  She is holding ZOE by her forearms. TESSA stands her 
  ground, ZOE takes a small step back but keeps eye 
  contact. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        Oh do tell me tales, Zoe. 
 
  The door opens. JED puts his head around the door, 
    nervously. 
 
                                        JED 
                  Tessa. Zoe. Harry wants to see you. 
 
  A moment, TESSA and ZOE still looking at each other. 
 
 
  TESSA, ZOE, HARRY. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            I have the same seniority as Tom! Why wasn t 
                                  I in the loop? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    (Taking out a file from his desk.) 
            Oh career, career Tessa, careering along we 
            go faster and faster straight over the edge 
                            of the bloody cliff! 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 56
 

                                        TESSA 
                                        Harry? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Stressful day. I ll brief you on what you 
              have not learnt already in the ladies ... 
 
  ZOE, a nervous flicker at TESSA. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                ... but first things first. You have a 
              source. One Billy Turner. He lies in a home 
                  grown British Anarchist group called 
                                   Trashers.  No? 
 
  TESSA looks at the file on the table. The name on the 
  front is  Billy Turner.  
 
                                        TESSA 
                          He s not that reliable. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          He looks terrific to me. 
                                (Consults file.) 
                          Spent enough on him too. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              He s quality. But I don t think he ll be 
                        anywhere near Istvan Vogel. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              We need anything we can get. We are in a 
                state of collective desperation, right? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  I ll meet him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              No, Zoe will. You have more senior tasks. 
                    Where s the dead drop with Billy? 
 
  A beat. TESSA is cross. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  Barnes Common. 
 
  He slides the file over to ZOE. She picks it up. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              I really don t ... 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 57
 

                                        HARRY 
                                        What? 
 
  Do not mess with HARRY today ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        Fine. 
 
 
  They have been working for hours. The back doors are 
  open. The group is crouched twenty yards off. They are 
  cooking - calor gas stoves, not fires. ANDREA is bringing 
  them coffee. PETER has ingratiated himself. There is an 
    atmosphere of enthusiasm. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                The corner of the garden of 10 Downing 
              Street. See? There! Three cameras ... Two 
              turn ... There ... The third ... There ... 
              And for five seconds there is a gap. One 
            metre wide. One of us could get over the wall 
                                into the garden. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
            Because... look. There are no cameras on the 
                                      windows. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                Grappling hooks. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
              Yes. We can throw grappling hooks to the 
            windows, break in. A little mountaineering. 
                            To the summit meeting. 
 
  They are pleased with this, smiles. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        And? 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
              We will reach the cabinet room. The most 
                  powerful room in your country. Chain 
              ourselves to the legs of the famous table. 
 
                                        PETER 
            I don t doubt you ve got the balls to do it.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 58
 

                        But what will you achieve? 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
            We will raise consciousness. In the public 
                                        mind. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                      (Scoffs.) 
            Nothing will piss off the  public mind  more 
              than - forgive me - a bunch of foreigners 
            busting into the Prime Minister s house after 
                      trampling over his flowerbeds. 
                                      (Angrily) 
              It s stupid, it s crass, it s infantile. 
 
                                        ISTVAN 
                              (An annoyed edge.) 
            Then, since you come so fresh to the cause, 
                              what do you suggest? 
 
                                        PETER 
                              (Straight passion.) 
            If you want to change the world, really give 
                      the powers-that-be a fright. 
 
  A stunned moment in the group. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                      And how do we do that, Peter? 
 
  A big grin from PETER as he reaches for the laptop. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Let me amaze you with the vulnerability of 
                              the modern world. 
 
 
  TOM walks in through the front door and goes into the 
  living area. ELLIE and MAISIE are having breakfast. 
 
  MAISIE bright and happy, ELLIE dull, in neutral. 
 
                                        TOM 
          So! We doing something today? Like driving up 
                                to Alton Towers? 
 
  ELLIE stands and lifts plates away from the table. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                          (Bouncy, kisses Matthew.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 59
 

                      Alton Towers! Matthew Matthew! 
 
  ELLIE at the sink. Her face is set. 
 
                                        TOM 
            I want to talk to you first, though Maisie. 
                      Let s go in your room, right? 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                        Yes. 
 
  And she s off. 
 
  TOM looks at ELLIE, who does not turn round. He goes into 
  MAISIE s room. 
  He pulls the door half shut. He wants ELLIE to hear. 
 
 
                                        TOM 
                        My real name isn t Matthew. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                          What is your name, then? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Tom. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                    Have I got to call you Tom, then? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Do you mind? 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                          (An unconcerned shrug.) 
                    Why did you say you were Matthew? 
 
                                        TOM 
                    Because Matthew was a secret name. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
            It wasn t a secret name cos I know it. Tom s                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 60
 

                              your secret name. 
 
  TOM is a little phased by the logic of that. 
 
  ELLIE is at the door, listening. 
 
 
                                        TOM 
                I m a spy. Do you know what a spy is? 
 
                                        MAISIE 
              Someone who watches someone when they don t 
                        know they re being watched. 
 
 
                                        TOM 
              My job s ... just about keeping us safe. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                Is it exciting? 
 
  TOM, looking over MAISIE s shoulder at ELLIE. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Yes. 
 
  ELLIE steps back. 
 
 
  MAISIE is running in excitedly to ELLIE. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
              Matthew s real name is Tom and he s a spy, 
              Matthew s his spy name but we can call him 
            Tom now. And he promised he won t get shot 
                  again. And we re not to tell. Ever. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                      We going to Alton Towers now? 
 
  ELLIE looks at TOM. TOM smiles and shrugs. 
 
 
  ZOE has the money in her hand. She is standing on a 
  chair. She has prized open a polystyrene ceiling tile to 
  hide the money. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              (Low, to herself.) 
            Do do, what to do ... Oh God... Who s going 
                                to believe me? 
 
  She hears DANNY come home. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 63
 

                                  DANNY (O.S.) 
                                        Zoe? 
 
 
  DANNY stands looking at the living room. It s a mess. 
  There s takeaway debris, ZOE s coat, a collapsed pile of 
  dirty laundry. 
 
  He storms towards her door. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            Zoe you in there? I ve had a bitch of a day 
                        and this I can do without. 
 
  ZOE comes out of her door fast. Her face is like stone. 
  She throws a bra onto the pile of laundry. DANNY is taken 
  aback. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      You OK? 
 
                                        ZOE 
              Good idea. I ll decide to be OK. Good. I m 
                      watching telly, what about you? 
 
  She bumps down o the sofa and picks up the tv control. 
  DANNY is left high and dry. 
 
 
  The only illumination is from the flashlights of the 
  three intruders. They go along doors until they come to 
  one with a notice that says  Geo-Topology Research Unit  
 
  PETER begins to open it with the crow bar. 
 
  0212 
 
  The door flies open and they burst in. 
 
  Long desk map drawers, maps on the wall, wonderful 
  photographs from all over the world, computers. 
 
                                        HORST 
                                  Which machine? 
 
  There is a machine with a huge screen. 
 
                                        PETER 
                              That ll be the one. 
 
  PETER sits down at it and turns it on. He takes the CD 
  Rom from a pocket and slips it into the computer. Out of 
  the corner of his eye, he sees HORST holding a gun, and 
  turns on him. 
 
                                        PETER 
                Don t be a bloody idiot. Put that away. 
 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 65
 

    A SECURITY GUARD comes round the end of the corridor. He 
  sees the gun in HORST s hand. The SECURITY GUARD freezes, 
  backs away, then turns and runs. HORST is unaware. 
 
  0230 
 
  HORST is getting angry. 
 
                                        HORST 
                                How much longer? 
 
                                        PETER 
                          (Lost in concentration.) 
              How long ... is a piece ... of string ... 
 
                                        HORST 
              I don t trust you to do this, I have never 
                        trusted you to do this ... 
 
  And an alarm goes off. PETER responds immediately. 
 
                                        PETER 
            Take the computers! Just the towers! They ll 
                    think this is just a break-in ... 
 
  HORST hesitates for a moment then rips a computer tower 
  from its wires and hands it to ANDREA. He is ripping 
  another free. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                What about you? 
 
  She looks at him. HORST has a computer tower in his arms. 
 
                                        HORST 
                              Don t let us down. 
 
  He runs out. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                            They ll find you here. 
 
                                        PETER 
                              Then I ll tell lies. 
 
                                        ANDREA 
                                        No. 
 
                                        PETER 
            This is my bit against the empire. Let me do                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 66
 

                                        it. 
 
  She kisses him. She goes out of the room and the camera 
  follows her ... 
 
 
  The alarm sounding; PETER still concentrating on the 
  computer. 
 
  ANDREA comes out of the door. The security man with a 
    flashlight at the far end of the corridor shouts at her 
  and HORST. 
 
                                  SECURITY MAN 
                                      Oi you! 
 
  She runs for it. The Security Man runs after her. As he 
  passes the Geography IT door PETER steps out and smashes 
  him across the throat then chops him on the back of the 
  neck. 
 
  PETER and ANDREA - in crossed beams of light - stand for 
  a brief moment, looking at each other. Then she turns and 
  runs. 
 
  Peter turns. A SECOND SECURITY MAN is at the end of the 
  corridor, looking at him. PETER points at him menacingly. 
  The Second Security Man turns and runs. PETER steps back 
  into the Geography room. 
 
 
  Armed police are at one end of the corridor. They shine a 
  torch toward the still unconscious security man. The 
  second security man is with them. A POLICEMAN raises a 
    megaphone. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                                  Armed police. 
 
  0255 
 
                                POLICEMAN (O.S.) 
            Now don t let s have anyone else hurt. Let s 
                  do this carefully. No need to rush. 
 
                                        PETER 
                      (Turning off the computer. Low.) 
                      Oh yes there is, you bastards. 
                                      (Loudly.) 
                                I m coming out! 
 
 
  PETER comes out into the corridor slowly, his hands held 
  up. But it goes wrong. The First Security Guard stirs. He 
  grabs PETER s ankle. The policeman at the end of the 
  corridor panics. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
            Hands above your head hands above your ... 
 
  And one of his colleagues throws a stun grenade. Everyone 
  throws themselves to the ground, hands over their ears. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 68
 

  A moment - then the grenade goes off. PETER falls to the 
  ground, hands pressed to his ears. 
 
 
  HARRY, ZOE, TESSA, TOM just coming through the door. 
  TESSA is saying ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                    ... Well I think I should do it! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Is he here yet? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Special Branch just brought him in to the 
                                      basement. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        Any idea where the girl is? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              No. Oh fuckadoole. 
 
  For JOOLS SIVITER is steaming toward the office. He 
  enters without knocking. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                Well now your star officer gets caught 
              stealing computers from a University! I m 
                                  quiz master. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Tom is quizzing him. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              TOM? Tinkering Tom here is responsible for 
              this mess. If it s one of you, let it be 
                                        Tessa. 
 
  ZOE starts. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                  A perspective from outside, Harry ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  (Ignoring her.) 
            Jools til the day you and your Old Etonian 
                    cronies get me the push this is my

                                        JOOLS 
                      I hope I have viewing rights. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  Be our guest. 
 
  TESSA storms out. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                Lively this side of the river isn t it? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      Do you want him now or later? 
 
  TOM thinks just for a moment. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Right away. 
 
 
  TOM is by the pods. He claps his hands. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Listen up everyone! 
 
  They are all ears. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
              When our guest arrives no staring. He s a 
              returning hero, right? Zoe, when he passes 
              your station say hello, normal as you can. 
 
  He jumps off table and goes to the pods. A moment. Then 
  PETER SALTER - still in black combat gear - approaches 
  from the other side of the pods, flanked by two SPECIAL 
  BRANCH HEAVIES. He comes through the pods. 
 
  TOM extends a hand. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Peter. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        Tom? 
 
  Shakes. The pod closes, Special Branch men still behind 
  it. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 70
 

                                        TOM 
                    I thought we d use Harry s office. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                  He s not here? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Some function. He was over the moon to hear 
              you re out. He ll be here soon as he can. 
 
  FROM PETER S POV: he looks across the Grid. His vision is 
  a little blurred. There is a low but even ringing in his 
  ears - we hear it. 
 
  GENERAL POV: 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Hello Peter. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        Zoe. 
 
  She smiles. Not a crack. TOM and PETER have reached 
  HARRY s office. TOM opens the door. 
 
 
  HARRY, JOOLS, TESSA watching intently as - on screens - 
  TOM and PETER enter HARRY s office. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                    Bug your own office do you Harry? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        Just for special occasions. 
 
  ZOE slips in. 
 
 
  TOM and PETER SALTER. They sit. Not with the desk between 
  them. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Are you OK? 
 
                                        PETER 
            Yeah I m OK, touch of tinnitus ... With the 
                                    bang bangs.

  TOM producing two glasses and a bottle of malt. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      (Pouring.) 
                    Well here we go, Harry s finest. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                    Not for me. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Anyway. 
                                  (Toasts him.) 
                                      A triumph. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                    You reckon? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Though you were so off piste you weren t even 
                                on the mountain. 
 
  A little laugh. PETER is forced to laugh too. TOM sips. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
              So let s do the details. Personnel, what 
            they re planning. It is the President s visit 
                              they re going for? 
 
  A beat. PETER is trying to get his game plan together. 
  He s very wary of TOM s improvisations. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        Yeah. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Where s their HQ? 
 
                                        PETER 
                          They had me blind folded. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Any feelings? 
 
                                        PETER 
                              I felt East Anglia. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        East Anglia. Not much cover.

                                        PETER 
                              There were sheds ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Aircraft hangers? 
 
                                        PETER 
                                      Could be. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Don t matter, we ve got the girl. She ll tell 
                                        us. 
 
  PETER very still. 
 
  FROM PETER S POV: the slight blur, the tinnitus. TOM 
  seems at a strange remove to him. 
 
                                        TOM 
            And cos of your cover, you went along with 
          this ... Silly university stunt. What was the 
                      point - theft to raise funds? 
 
  GENERAL POV: 
 
                                        PETER 
                            Right. They re broke. 
 
  The moment hangs. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Yeah, we picked the girl up. she got away 
          from the University, but then did this really 
                      stupid thing. She hurt herself. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        How? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Broken ankle. Her comrades left her. By the 
                                        canal. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                    They would. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Hard lot, are they?

                                        PETER 
                                They reckon so. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  East Anglia? 
                                    (A beat.) 
            Shall I make a leap? You always taught me to 
                                    make leaps. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                      (Rattled.) 
                                Be my guest ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Wales. 
 
  There is the smallest flicker from PETER s eyes. 
 
 
                                        ZOE 
            (Punches the air - still a whisper though.) 
                                        Yes!

                              Was that a guess?

                East Anglia s the opposite side of the 
                                country to Wales. 
 
 
  A pause. Then PETER pours a glass of whisky. 
 
                                        PETER 
                          Have you just cracked me? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  (Very softly.) 
                        I don t know. You tell me. 
 
                                        PETER 
                              Fuck you Tom Quinn. 
                            (He downs the whisky.) 
              The old Cernwyth Army Range, North of the 
            Black Mountains. I trained there when it was 
              alive - the same faces, same places come 
            around. Cheeky though, eh? Anarchists holing 
              up on derelict MOD property. They re in                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 74

                                        maps. 
 
 
  HARRY at once, pointing at ZOE. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Go! 
 
  She s half out of the room already. 
 
 
  PETER looks around. He sees ZOE crashing, running, half 
  falling across the Grid. He laughs. 
 
                                        PETER 
                        Do you really have Andrea? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Oh yes. Paddington Green nick. The Special 
                    Branch quiz masters are with her. 
 
                                        PETER 
                  Those animals. I want her here. Now. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Sure. 
 
  He lifts a phone. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Bring Miss Chambers over to Thames House. 
 
 
  HARRY on the phone. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  Rightaway Tom. 
 
  Puts phone down.

                                      Absolutely. 
 
 
                                        TOM 
                                So you walked. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                        Yeah. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        (Low.) 
                    You, of all people. Why, Peter? 
 
                                        PETER 
                Boredom. Crippling, chest tearing, bum 
              clenching boredom. With what the country s 
              become ... Boredom with buy, sell, image, 
            credit card Nirvana and nothing else. I mean 
          when the Soviet Union was crap you felt yeah, 
              we ve got something. My Dad died for it. 
            Democracy. But now ... Nothing. It s all gone 
                ... Dead. No one believes in anything 
            anymore. Then there was Andrea. This ... posh 
            girl, turning herself inside out. For what 
            she believed. The passion for a new life, it 
              tore her apart, run her ragged and nearly 
              bonkers but ... she was in good faith. I 
            always thought that about you, Tom. You are 
                                in good faith. 
 
                                        TOM 
              And you threw everything away to go on a 
            little robbery for your new Anarchist faith? 
              It was a feint, wasn t it. What were you 
                  doing there, Peter? In a Geography 
                                      Department? 
 
                                        PETER 
                    When Andrea s here I ll tell you. 
 
  They look at each other. TOM gives nothing away. But 
  PETER reads him right. 
 
                                  PETER (CONT D) 
                              She will be here. 
                                      (a beat) 
                She won t. Because you don t have her.

                                        TOM 
                                        I... 
 
                                        PETER 
                    The old tricks are the best, eh? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                You trained me. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                  You bastard... 
 
  The tinnitus is worsening. PETER holds his head. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Peter. Come back to us. You know we don t 
            burn our own. You ll be given a desk job for 
            a while, something decently meaningless. Then 
              retirement, pension, the perks. You can be 
                                  with Andrea. 
 
  It has become very intimate between them. 
 
                                        PETER 
                            She got back to Wales? 
 
                                        TOM 
            We assume so. Peter, don t make us crucify 
                                        you. 
 
                                        PETER 
                        I ve got to go to the bog. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Sure. 
 
  Stands. 
 
 
  TOM and PETER make their way to the men s loo. 
    Surreptitious eyes follow them. 
 
 
  PETER and TOM enter. 
 
  PETER goes into a stall. He tries to close the door - TOM 
  stops him and keeps it open. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 77
 

                                        TOM 
              Peter. I still respect you. I want to keep 
                                        that. 
 
                                        PETER 
              You won t put me out to grass, will you? 
            There ll be no dream retirement cottage with 
            garden, Andrea picking roses in a see-through 
              chiffon dress. Don t kid me, Tom. There s 
              only one future for me. To go back in the 
            field. As a double agent, betraying her, her 
            friends, their contacts... I d be deadly for 
                                        them. 
 
                                        TOM 
            No disgrace. You d be serving your country. 
 
                                        PETER 
            I think that s what she s doing. Forgive me, 
            Tom. I m with her world, not yours. I won t 
                                    betray her. 
 
  A beat. TOM is tense, he can t read what PETER is going 
  to do - but he senses something is coming. 
 
                                        PETER 
          Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        What? 
 
                                        PETER 
            Would you give your life to protect what you 
                                    believe in? 
 
    A silence. 
 
  PETER looks at him. There is a wild, almost watery look 
  in his eyes. 
 
                                        PETER 
                                      I would. 
 
  TOM is moving but he is a fraction too late. PETER 
  smashes his forearm across TOM s throat. 
 
  TOM goes crashing to the floor, clutching at his 
  windpipe, unable to make a sound.

  TOM S POV LEVEL WITH THE FLOOR: PETER is taking off his 
  trousers very fast in the cubicle. 
 
  TOM manages to let out a cry. 
 
  GENERAL POV: Men bursting into the loo. 
 
  PETER has hanged himself in the cubicle, a trouser leg as 
  a rope attached the cistern s pipe, jumping to break his 
  neck. 
 
  TOM lets out a terrible cry of mourning, reaching out to 
  PETER. 
 
 
  HARRY, JOOLS, TOM. HARRY speaking. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              We know the terrible cost the Service can 
            wreak on all of us. And how the strongest can 
            be proved weak because of its demands. There 
                but for the grace of God go all of us. 
 
  At TOM s station. ZOE is looking at her computer screen, 
  and whispering to DANNY, over HARRY s speech. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    (whispering) 
              Why bust into a geography Department in a 
                  University, and kill yourself for it?

                                    (whispering) 
              Geography. Names of towns, rivers, valleys 
                          and hills ... It s mad.

            But don t lose sight of the fact this was an 
            extraordinary operation and a great success. 
          An entire and potentially dangerous extremist 
              group, stopped in its tracks. Its leader 
            facing extradition. Prosecutions at home. And 
              a point to the public very well made. Very, 
                                very well done. 
 
  Claps on the grid but the mood is still uncertain.

                  Now Jools Siviter will eat his hat. 
 
  Laughs. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          Well little sisters ... Big sister says ... A 
                wake for Peter Salter. Free drinks on 
            Vauxhall Cross, upstairs at the George Head. 
                Then we can all go out with clear heads 
                tomorrow to welcome the President of the 
              United States to our shores. Unmolested by 
                          assorted euro-anarchists. 
 
  Cheers.

  Bored clerks, very young, cleaners, office workers,

            So. What are the three aims of the service? 
 
  No one puts a hand up. 
 
                                        DANNY

                                        DANNY 
            Well. Well I tell you one scam an agent was

                        Well, they thought they had.

  Giggles. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                Don t be cheeky. The three aims of the 
                                  service are ... 
 
  He stops. Stunned by something. Then he rushes from the 
  room, leaving the students stunned. 
 
 
  The grid is empty but for ZOE still before the computer. 
  And DANNY - who is crashing past chairs and desks to get 
  to her, shouting. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              I want to fly away! River deep, mountain 
                              high! ... Fly away! 
 
  ZOE looks at him as if he is mad. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
                  I know what Peter Salter was up to. 
                Geography, hills and valleys ... National 
            Ordnance Survey. And the Survey s computers 
                                        ... 
 
                                        ZOE 
                      Oh God. Air Traffic Control. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            RIGHT! They supply Air Traffic Control with 
                information about the height of aircraft                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 4 Page 81
 

                flight paths, above hills, valleys ... 
 
                                        ZOE 
            You can t hack into Air Traffic control, the 
                only way s direct to the mainframe ... 
 
                                        DANNY 
          Zoe, in the Geography Department, they ve got 
            PHD s working on the Ordnance Survey ... it s 
                                  a way in ... 
 
  He grabs a phone. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    I know what they re going to do. 
 
 
  TOM lets himself in. He feels his neck. ELLIE is watching 
    Newsnight. 
 
  His mobile rings. 
 
                                DANNY (ON PHONE) 
                                      Tom ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      No ... 
 
  He listens for a moment. Then the world goes weird around 
  him. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            Air Traffic control? 
 
 
                                        DANNY 
          He s put a virus in the mainframe. It ll down 
            the system. And the President lands at Brize 
                      Norton four hours from now ... 
 
 
                                        TOM 
                    OK OK! Let s meet for a drink ... 
 
  He rings off and stands there, legs apart, trousers 
  crumpled, stunned by the revelation.

  In the living room ELLIE exclaims: 
 
                                  ELLIE (O.S.) 
                                      My God! 
 
 
  He pushes the door open. She is watching Newsnight. There 
  are pictures of aircraft, President Bush, Heathrow 
  Terminals in a montage. The drone of the commentary can t 
  be heard. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
          Hey Tom! Seen the news? Air Traffic control s 
              gone down. Bush is having to land in Paris 
                              and come by train. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        What do they say happened? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                Some obscure technical problem ... The 
                          country s falling to bits. 
 
  She turns off the TV. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT D) 
                              How was your day? 
 
                                        TOM 
                A man, who believed in a cause, killed 
                  himself for love. Totally pointless. 
 
  ELLIE is shocked by his bitter tone. She stares at him. 
 
  And the telephone rings. 
 
  Black screen.
