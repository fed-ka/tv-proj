      A solitary FIGURE walks to the guardrail, then climbs up
      onto the handrail.  One foot, then another.  He's going to
      jump.  We're waiting for the cut.  But the shot lingers...

    The shot dissolves from low-res, and we're there, with this
      crazy asshole, teetering two hundred feet over the water. 
      He's homeless, in a filthy coat, but it's taking the balance
    of an athlete for him to stand up there.  He pulls out a
      pint bottle.  Finishes it off.  Drops it.  Watches it hurtle
      towards the void below. 

                                      REESE (V.O.)
                    No one cares.  No one's keeping score. 
                    No one is coming to save you... 

      Suddenly a finger of light appears a mile down the East River. 
    He watches as it travels upwards, then explodes in color. 
      Then another.  Fireworks.  It's the Fourth of July. 

    The man shakes his head.  Disbelief.  One charming, broken
      laugh as he climbs back down from the rail and walks back
      towards the city.  This is REESE.


      4 AM: end of the line.  Surveillance cameras pick up a group
    of well dressed TOUGH GUYS making their way out of a trendy
      night spot, bouncers deferential.  They're arranged around
      ANTON, 21, fuckup son of one of the city's Mafia lieutenants.   

      Anton lights a firecracker.  Throws it at the feet of a
      passing COUPLE.  BANG.  The couple hurry on, freaked.                                                                                          2.

      A Range Rover pulls up.  Anton looks unhappy. 

                                      ANTON
                    No one lets me have any fun anymore. 
                    I'm taking the train home. 

    He walks.  His entourage shrugs, then follows. 


    The lawyer guides Reese down the steps of the station house.                                                                                         7.

                      I appreciate the help, counselor. 
                    Who's picking up the tab? 

    The lawyer ignores him, leaving Reese at the corner, where a
      town car is double parked.  Two PRIVATE SECURITY MEN are
      waiting, making it clear that they want Reese to get in. 

                                      PRIVATE SECURITY
                    Our employer wants a word with you. 

      Reese weighs his options. A block back, Carter pushes through
    the front doors of the station, hunting for him.  Reese
      shrugs.  Climbs into the back of the car. 


    The car speeds through Manhattan.  The city is slowly coming
      alive, like a toy being wound up, about to let spin. 

                                      REESE
                    I'm a little tired, fellas.  Maybe
                    another time.  You can just drop me-

    The security guys respond by locking the doors with a THUNK. 


    The car stops and Reese climbs out.  A man is waiting for
      him, staring out over the city.  This is FINCH, 50s, rumpled
      suit, haunted eyes, body stiff from some old, deep wounds.  

                                      REESE
                    Do I owe you money?  Because I'm
                    running a little short at the moment.

                    You don't owe me anything, Mr. Reese.
                    That's the name you prefer, isn't
                    it?  I know you've had... several. 

      Reese reacts at the mention of his name.

                                      FINCH (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry.  I'm not going to tell
                    anyone about you.  

                                      REESE

                    I know exactly everything about you,
                    Mr. Reese.  I know about the work
                    you used to do for the government.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        8.

                                      FINCH (CONT'D)
                    I know about the... doubts you came
                    to have about that work.  I know the
                      government, along with everyone else,
                    thinks you're dead -- a star on the
                    wall at CIA headquarters in Langley.  

      At this last comment, Reese steps closer to Finch, anger
      rising.  Finch's security respond, until he waves them off. 

                                      FINCH (CONT'D)
                    I know you've spent the last two
                    months trying to drink yourself to
                    death.  And I know you're considering
                    more efficient ways to do it.  Which 
                    would be a shame.  You see --
                    knowledge is not my problem.  Doing
                    something with that knowledge is
                    where I'm... lacking.  That's where
                    you would come in.

                    I think we could help each other.
                    You see, Mr. Reese, I don't think
                    you need a psychiatrist.  Or a support
                    group.  Or pills.  

                                      REESE
                    Yeah?  What do I need? 

                                      FINCH
                    You need a purpose.  More
                      specifically, you need a job. 

      Reese LAUGHS.  Is he serious?  

                                      REESE
                    What kind of job? 

                                      FINCH
                    It's a little unconventional, and
                    it'll take a little while to explain. 
                    Of course I'll pay you for your time. 
                    I know you don't care about the money. 
                    But if you're going to drink yourself
                    to death, you could at least do it
                    with a higher grade of alcohol. 

    One of Finch's security holds out a wad of hundreds.  Gestures
      back towards the car.  Reese thinks it over, then takes the
      money and climbs into the car.  The knife edge of the sun is
      rising over the East River.                                                                                        9.


      The car glides through the morning rush hour of Manhattan. 
      At each stop light, people stream around the car.  Millions
      of them, all heading in different directions. 

                                      FINCH
                    8 million people.  You know what

                    these people, very bad things are on
                    the way.  Someone is murdered in New
                    York every 18 hours.  Did you know
                    that?  It's like musical chairs.  At
                    the end of the day, one of these
                    people will be gone.

                    them; not the ones that happen in
                    the heat of the moment.  But some of
                    these crimes are planned for days or
                    weeks in advance.  What if you could

                          (laughs)
                    No psychics.  No magic.  You see,
                    when I was a kid, I wanted a jet
                    pack.  A summer house on Mars.  And
                    then I realized I was growing up in
                    the information age.  And that was a
                    shocking disappointment to me.  Until
                      I realized how important that was. 
                    How revolutionary.

                    with the right information, can change 
                      everything. 

      Finch steps out of the car and into the swirl of people around 
      them, morning commuters on their way to work.  Reese follows. 


      Finch stands on the street corner, people racing past him.                                                                                         10.

                    My problem, Mr. Reese, is that I 
                    have a list.  A list of people who

      Finch nods towards the sidewalk. Reese follows his gaze. 
      There, on the corner, waiting in line for a coffee from a
      vendor, is a WOMAN, 30s, pretty, suit.

                    It's not that simple.  I don't know
                    exactly what's about to happen.  Or
                    what her role in it is.  She could
                    be the victim.  She could be the
                      perpetrator.  All I know is that

                    What do you think? 

      Reese hesitates.  Looks at Finch.  Decides. 

                                      REESE
                    I think you're a bored rich guy with 
                    an agenda.  And I think I'm done. 

      Reese turns back.  Starts to walk away.  One of the security 
    men reaches for him.  Big mistake.  Reese wrenches his arm.  
      Pushes him back, using the man's head to BUTT the other 
      security man in the face.  It's brutal and fast. 

      When Finch turns back from his men, Reese is gone. 


      Surveillance footage.  Commuters stream down Second Avenue. 
    One man doesn't move:  Reese.

      Reese watches as Bray, the woman Finch pointed out earlier,
      steps out of her apartment building across the street.  Reese
      starts to tail her at a healthy distance.  Listens to Finch
    via an earpiece.

      Reese stands on the street corner, eating falafel and talking 
    to Finch on the phone.                                                                                         16.

                    Bray's taking ulcer medication.  And 
                    sleeping pills.  She's scared of 
                      something. 

      Bray walks past.  Reese dumps his meal and follows her. 


      Reese sets up a camera on the edge of the roof. Points it at
    the apartment across the street. Zooms and racks focus. 

      CAMERA P.O.V. -- Bray comes into view, pacing between her
      case files and Chinese takeout, talking on her landline. 

      Reese pulls out his smartphone.  Turns on a program called
      'Open mic.'  Suddenly he's listening to Bray's apartment
      through the mic on her cell phone, which is lying on the
      kitchen table.  We can hear her side of the conversation,
      but it grows louder and softer as she paces back and forth. 

                                    BRAY (V.O.)
                    I can't make it out this weekend.

                    Yes.  It's a tough job.  But I can 
                    look out for myself.  You know that.  

      Reese looks down as his phone vibrates with a text: '150 W. 
      Bemis Street.  20 Minutes.'


      Reese follows Finch at a distance.  As he watches, Finch's
      security team drop seamlessly into place, tailing Finch at a
      careful distance.  Finch turns a corner onto a quieter block.  

      Reese waits, then follows.  But the block is empty.  Finch
    is gone.  Reese's phone rings.  He answers, smiling.  

                                      FINCH (V.O.)
                    I told you, Reese.  I'm a private

      Reese looks up and down the empty street, impressed.

      Reese walks a darkened line of industrial buildings.  Stops
    at the address Finch has given him.


      Reese follows Bray and Miller as they walk back from the
      courthouse to the D.A.'s offices.  They're arguing.                                                                                         26.

    We can see Bray as she paces back and forth in her office,
      talking to someone on her land line.  The audio is picked up
    by her cell phone, which is on her desk.  Her words are only
      clear when she turns back from the window.

      conversation.  He watches as Bray hangs up and grabs her
      coat and bag.  Talks to Finch on his phone.

      Heads for the elevators.

      A WOMAN, 40s, leaves her door on the chain, eyes Bray up and

      A group of low-level DRUG DEALERS are operating off of the
      stoop of a boarded up building.  A LOOKOUT on the corner
      WHISTLES as Reese walks up.  Reese smiles at the main DEALER,
      then climbs up the stoop and sits down next to him.  The
      dealer mutes his bluetooth headset.  Looks at Reese,
        unimpressed.

                      conspiracy.  Keeps the phone numbers
                      memorized.  Wait.  Here we go. 

    He reads the screen.  He's watching the dealer type out a
      text, real time:  'Po-9 looking for you.  Watch out.'  After
      a moment a response pops up: 'Thanks.' 

      Reese taps out his own text, spoofing the dealer's number. 
      'Checking your house, next.  You home?' After a moment the
      response comes back.  'Nope.  Killmer.'                                                                                        34.


      Reese scans the park.  He spots a group of three TEENAGERS
      sitting on a park bench.  One of them is MICHAEL POPE, 16,
      backpack and a Jets hat.   He spots Reese a mile away.

      Michael keeps moving, ducking between parked cars.  The
      entrance to the subway is right ahead.  Suddenly Reese pops
    out in front of him, grabs his arm.

                                      MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    HELP.  Help me.  This guy tried to
                    get me into a cab with him.  Said he
                    wanted to take pictures of me. 

    The construction workers set down their lunches and begin
      walking towards them.  Reese raises a hand -- he's not
      touching the kid.  As he does he takes out his cell phone,
      slips it into the outer pocket of Michael's backpack. 

      Michael darts down into the subway, leaving Reese to deal
      with the construction workers. 


      Detective Carter pulls a flier from the For Sale sign planted
    in the front yard of a large house in a subdivision.  SUPER
      TITLE: WESTCHESTER COUNTY.  An unmarked cruiser pulls up,
    and DETECTIVE NICHOLS, 40s, climbs out. 

                                      NICHOLS
                    Detective Carter? 


      A familiar Range Rover pulls up, HEAVIES climb out.  Last
      one out, looking chagrined, hand still bandaged, is Anton.


      Reese steps outside.  Hails a cab.  Puts his earpiece in. 

                                      REESE
                    You found the kid?

                                      FINCH (V.O.)
                    Yes.  But I think someone else found
                    him first.  Listen-

      Reese's earpiece fills with the noise from the open mic on
    the cell phone he planted on the kid earlier. 


      The cab pulls up.  Reese calmly pays and climbs out.  Checks
      Michael's position on his cell phone.  

      Reese jogs the remaining block towards the park.  Pulls a
      ski mask out of the bag.  Slips it over his head.  Then he
      shoulders the 40mm grenade launcher.  Strides into the middle
      of the intersection at Central Park West. 


      Reese fires.  The tear gas grenade ARCS gracefully towards
    the speeding car, then SMASHES into its windshield and
      EXPLODES, filling the car with tear gas.  The SUV veers up
      onto the sidewalk and SLAMS into a light pole. 

      Doors open and the gunman climbs out, coughing, blinded by
      tear gas.  Reese SHOOTS the driver in the knee.  Grabs the
      tattooed man by his throat and KNOCKS him cold against the
    car door.  Grabs the kid. 

      Reese reaches down and grabs the wallet from the tattooed
      gunman.  Pulls the kid into the park. 


      Reese pulls off his ski mask as they make their way further
      into the park.  Hands Michael a water bottle. 

                                      REESE
                    Use this to wash out your eyes. 

                                      MICHAEL
                    You're crazy.  They're just going to
                    kill you, too, now.  Do you know who
                    those guys are? 

      Reese pulls out the tattooed man's wallet to check the ID.

                                      REESE
                    I do now.  They're cops. 

      The wallet holds a big gold badge: NYPD.

                                      ACT THREE


    The tattooed cop, wrist bandaged, pissed off, walks out of
    the station with two other COPS.  

      Watching them, from across the street, in a coffee shop:
      Reese.  He snaps a series of pictures as the cops climb into
    an unmarked car and pull away.  


      Reese watches from a taxi as the unmarked car pulls to a
      halt.  After a moment an overweight man climbs down the stoop
    and leans into the window.  Reese recognizes him as Detective
      Fusco -- the homicide detective who arrested Pope.  Reese
      snaps another picture. 


      Finch walks out of a restaurant, alone.  His security team
      waits by the car.  One of them sports a band-aid on his nose
      from his earlier encounter with Reese.  

                                      REESE (O.S.)
                    I don't know where you work.  Or 
                    where you live.  I'm not sure I know 
                    your real name.  But I know where 
                    you eat lunch. 

      Finch turns.  Reese is walking up the sidewalk.  Tosses him 
      a balled up napkin with the same logo as the restaurant Finch 
      just walked out of.  One of Finch's security guys steps 
      forward.  Reese looks at him, menacing.

                    You want one to match your friend? 

    He points to the other security guy and his band-aid.  The 
      security man backs off.  Reese turns to Finch. 

                                      REESE (CONT'D)

      Finch and Reese walk through the park.  

                                      REESE
                    What exactly have you gotten me into?

                    I don't know.  That's the whole point. 

      Reese hands Finch a file folder with some pictures: Stills, 
    the tattooed narcotics cop; and Fusco.  

                                      REESE
                    The real killers are a group of
                    corrupt cops led by this man: Stills.
                    He used to be partners with Fusco,
                    the homicide detective who collared
                    Pope.  Which explains how they were
                    able to plant that much evidence on
                    him.  Stills has four men working in
                    his unit. They've already murdered
                    six people.

                    Bray got a phone call this morning --
                    Alonzo Pope was stabbed to death in
                    his cell last night.  I don't think
                    they could get away with this without
                    some help inside the DA's office. 
                    Which might explain why Bray became
                    so suspicious of Miller.  

      Finch looks away, troubled.

                    guessing they'll think it's better
                    to take out Bray than to risk her

      Finch turns to look back at the city.  He looks at Reese.  
    Can he trust him?

                          (off his look)
                    I was here.  In New York.  I was
                    working.  And I had said I didn't
                    want to be disturbed.  And I wasn't. 
                    I didn't know what had happened until
                    I came out that evening.  And everyone
                    was gone.  You see, Mr. Reese, that
                    day didn't just change your life. 
                    It changed mine, as well.  I had
                    spent most of my life up to that
                    moment making myself very very rich. 
                    But that didn't seem to amount to
                    very much.  So I decided to do
                    something about it.  I decided to
                    build something.

                    flowing into the intelligence
                      communities was like a fire hose. 
                    Human analysts weren't capable of
                    sorting through it all.  So I built
                    something that could do it for them. 
                    A machine that would listen to every
                    phone call.  Read every email.  Watch
                    through every camera.  And pick the
                      terrorists out of the general
                      population before they can act. 

                                      REESE
                    I worked for the government.  They 
                    don't have anything like this.

                    If anyone ever found out they did,
                    the program would be shut down
                      immediately.  That's the devil's
                    bargain: the public wanted to be
                      protected.  No one wanted anything
                    like that to happen again. They just
                    didn't want to know how they were
                      protected. 

      Finch turns back from the city.  Watches kids playing in the 
      park, carefree.

                    Not the next jealous husband.  And
                    so I altered the software.  I taught
                    the machine to divide the things it
                    saw into two categories: relevant,
                    and irrelevant.  Events that would
                    cause massive loss of life or threaten
                    national security were relevant. 
                    They were passed along at the highest
                    channels to the NSA or the FBI.

                    I can't see all the angles.  I don't
                    see how all the pieces fit together. 
                    These are just educated guesses. 

      Finch turns to walk back to his car. 

                                      FINCH
                    I never said the job would be easy, 
                    Mr. Reese. 


      Reese watches from the shadows as Stills and his men shake 
      down a group of drug dealers on the corner.  They look pissed -- 
      they're looking for Michael and the man who took him.  Stills 
    is a sadist -- he enjoys this.


      Reese scans the DA's building opposite with his binoculars. 

      REESE'S P.O.V -- Miller is burning the midnight oil, digging 
      through boxes of old case files, looking for something. 


      Reese watches from a street corner as Fusco stakes out the 
      restaurant in his unmarked car. 

      After a moment, the lights in the restaurant flicker off.  
      William Robinson, the born-again ex-con, walks out with the 
      NIGHT MANAGER.  Begins walking home.  Fusco follows him. 


      Reese waits to put Michael Pope onto a bus for Baltimore.  
      Puts some cash in his pocket. 

                                      REESE
                    You go straight to your aunt's house.  
                    And stay clear of New York.  I'll 
                    send word when you can come back.   

                                      MICHAEL
                    Aren't you going to need me to 
                    testify?  They killed my brother.  

                                      REESE
                    You didn't trust me before.  You 
                    trust me now? 
                          (off his look)
                    I'll take care of it. 

      Reluctantly, the kid climbs onto the bus. 


    As Reese walks out, his phone rings. 

                                      FINCH (V.O.)
                    Bray's leaving her office.  She got
                    a call from someone claiming to have
                      information on the shooters.  They
                    wanted her to meet at Remsen and
                    Avenue D in Canarsie.  20 minutes. 

      Reese tries to hail a cab.  Suddenly, the cabs have run dry. 
      Typical New York.  Reese heads down a side street.  Finds a
      parked car.  Waits for a quiet moment, then smashes the window
      with the butt of his rifle.  Climbs inside and hotwires the
      car.                                                                                         52.


      Reese carves through traffic, trying to catch up. 


      We're looking at Carter from a laptop camera in a business 
      across the street.  She's framed by the window. 

                                      CARTER (V.O.)
                    He knew you, didn't he?  But he 
                    couldn't save you.                                                                                         53.

      The shot cuts to static.  Suddenly we're firing through 
      hundreds of shots.  We settle on a traffic camera feed:


      A station wagon pulls to the side of a deserted stretch of
      highway.  A MAN climbs out, pulls open the trunk, and pulls
      out a WOMAN'S BODY.  He drags the body to the passenger seat. 
      Props her inside.  Closes the door.  Stabs the passenger
      side tire sidewall with a screwdriver.  Throws the screwdriver
      into the bushes.  Gets back in the car.  Pulls away. 


      Reese pulls to a halt on Avenue D.  Checks his cell phone -- 
      Bray is a few blocks ahead.  He ditches the car and walks 
      along the sidewalk.  The neighborhood is deserted. 

      Ahead, he sees an unmarked police cruiser pull to the curb a
      block up.  Stills climbs out, followed by three of his men. 
      Reese ducks out of sight.  Stills looks up and down the
      street, then directs his men to circle around the building,
      trapping Bray.  


      Reese moves quickly down the alleyway, diagonally towards 
      Bray's location.  He calls Finch. 

                                      REESE
                    They're coming for Bray now.  I'm 
                    too late.  Call her.  Make something 
                    up. Get her out of here. 

      Reese glides silently down the alleyway, weapon drawn.  Ahead,
    he can see a small opening -- a loading dock behind an
      abandoned warehouse.  Bray is waiting there, alone.  As Reese
      watches, she checks the caller ID on her phone, then ignores
    the call. 

      Reese moves forward, sticking to the shadows, weapon raised.  
    He can see Stills' men drawing closer on all sides. 

                                    BRAY
                    Are you here? 

      REESE'S P.O.V -- Reese positions Stills' head in the 
      crosshairs.  Exhales, ready for the shot. 

                                    BRAY (CONT'D)
                    You're going to keep me waiting, 
                    Stills?  We don't have time for this.

      Stills steps out of the shadows.  Bray turns to him.  Reese 
      takes his finger off the trigger, confused.                                                                                         54.

                                      STILLS
                    What's the problem?  Pope is dead.  
                    His brother hasn't turned up.  Might 
                    be dead himself. 

                                    BRAY
                    Miller.  Miller's the problem, you
                    idiot.  He knows.  About Pope.  Maybe
                    some of the others.  He's got a file
                    on you and your men, Stills.  He's
                    been working it up after hours.  I
                    told you we needed to take care of
                    him weeks ago.  I even picked out
                    the shooter for you.  No more dragging
                    your feet.  

                                      STILLS
                    How long have we got? 

                                    BRAY
                    24 - 48 hours until he talks to the
                    DA.  Tops.  I can take care of the
                    files in his office.  But that means
                    you need to take care of Miller. 
                    Tonight.  

      Reese reacts.  He was right about everything except the most 
      important element:  Bray isn't the victim -- she's the 
      ringleader.  He begins backing up the alleyway.  He has to 
      tell Finch... and warn Miller. 

      Suddenly, a gun is pressed to his head.  Behind him: Fusco. 


      Reese walks stiffly along the sidewalk -- he's clearly in 
    bad shape.  He looks up and down the main street of the small 
      downtown area, as if expecting to see someone following him.  


      Reese sits, hunched in a stolen car, eyes blazing with pure 
      hate as he watches Peter Arndt climb into his car, heading 
      out to the gym.  He waits a few seconds, then climbs out. 


      Finch's town car pulls up.  Finch climbs out.  Finds the 
      remains of Reese's cell phone.  For the first time, we see 
      Finch's poker face crack: he looks worried.  


      The car swerves, drops one set of tires off the asphalt, 
      then swerves back and FLIPS, soaring into the air.  The 
      cruiser SLIDES a hundred yards, coming to rest on its roof.  

      For a second it's still.  Then Reese KICKS out the side window 
      and crawls out on his back.  With bound hands Reese SMASHES 
      out the driver's side window.  Hauls out a groggy Fusco.  

      Fusco fumbles for his weapon, but Reese already has it.  He 
      relieves Fusco of his extra mags, cash, cell phone.  Reese 
      hauls Fusco up, then turns him to face the water, gun pressed 
      to his back.  Fusco is resigned to it.  Ready to die. 

                                      REESE
                    You wearing your vest, Officer?

      Fusco nods.  Reese EMPTIES Fusco's service automatic into 
    his back.  Fusco GRUNTS in agony, then slumps to the ground. 

      Reese turns back.  The sun is setting behind the distant 
      towers of the city.  He starts the long walk back.  

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                        59.

                                        ACT FOUR


      A distant surveillance camera records an unmarked cruiser 
      pulling up alongside the building. 


      Stills climbs out of the car along with the other men. 

                                      STILLS
                    Azarello and me take the lobby.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        60.

                                      STILLS (CONT'D)
                          (to driver)
                    Soon as it's done, I send the shooter 
                    out.  You give him a block, maybe 
                    two, then take him out.  Head shots.  
                    Don't take any chances.  Understand?

      Stills pulls out a Ziploc bag with a .38 special in it.  
      Pulls on leather gloves. 

                                      STILLS (CONT'D)
                    Get our friend out of the trunk. 

    The driver pops the trunk and hauls out William Robinson, 
    the ex-con.  Robinson is wide-eyed, terrified. 

                                      STILLS (CONT'D)
                    Evening, William.  You ready to settle 
                    that score? 

      Stills grabs Robinson and pushes him towards the open 
      emergency exit of the condo. 


    The driver reverses down the alleyway to the next block, 
      keeping the emergency exit in sight.  He kills the lights 
    but keeps the engine running.  

      Suddenly, there's movement by the side of the car.  He reaches 
    for his weapon.  Too late.  He's yanked out of the car through 
    the open driver side window, then SLAMMED to the ground. 


      Miller takes his son by the hand, and they walk towards the 
      distant lights of Queens Boulevard.  Safe.  Alive.                                                                                         62.


      The darkened lobby suddenly FLARES with GUNSHOTS.  After a 
      moment, William pushes through the door, freaked but unharmed.  
      He looks around, then bolts. 


      An ambulance is pulled in front of the building.  EMTs are 
      loading Doyle into the back.  A tiny CROWD has formed.    

      Down the block, in the darkness, Reese finishes loading 
      something into the trunk of his stolen car.  Closes the trunk 
      lid, softly, then calls Finch. 

                                      REESE
                    Miller and his kid are safe. 


      Finch, in the back of his town car, watches through the window 
      as Miller and his kid line up with the crowds waiting to get 
      into the game. 

                                      FINCH
                    I know.  
                          (beat)
                    Thank you. 

      Finch hangs up the phone. 


      Reese walks along the walkway.  Finch is waiting for him.  
      Right at the spot we first met Reese, ready to jump.

                                      REESE
                    Funny place for a conversation.  

                                      FINCH
                    Seemed appropriate.  You see, you  
                    have a decision to make.

                                      REESE
                    The machine gave you another number. 

                                      FINCH
                    The numbers never stop coming.  You 
                    should know that.  Upfront. 
                          (beat)
                    If you want to leave, I'll give you 
                    as much money as you need.  You could 
                    buy that boat.  Disappear. 

                                      REESE
                    And if I stay? 

                                      FINCH
                    The truth?  If you stay, and we 
                    continue to do this... sooner or 
                    later both of us will probably be 
                    killed.  

                                      REESE
                    That's confidence-inspiring. 

                                      FINCH
                    I said I'd tell you the truth.  Not
                    that you'd like it.  They'll all be
                    looking for you.  The mob.  The
                    police.  Your old friends at the
                    CIA. 

      Reese looks out over the water.  Considers the drop. 

                                      REESE
                    I never really liked boats, anyway. 


      Carter paces the alleyway, looking for more evidence.  She
      reaches the junction with another alleyway.  In the distance
      she can see the noise and people of Queens Boulevard.  She
      turns back.  Hears a NOISE behind her.  Almost as if he meant
      it.  She draws her weapon.  Points it into the darkness. 

                                      CARTER
                    You came back.  Same reason as me.  
                    To make sure you hadn't left anything 
                    behind. 

      Silence.  Then, from the darkness:

                                      REESE (O.S.)
                    You said a project might be good for 
                    me.  I think I found one.

                                      CARTER
                    Not exactly what I had in mind.  I
                    think I know what happened to your
                    friend in New Rochelle.  Maybe you
                    had a good reason for what you did. 
                    But I've met a lot of bad guys.  And
                    they all thought they had a good
                    reason. 
                          (beat)
                    I'm going to catch you.  Sooner or 
                    later. 

                                      REESE (O.S.)
                    I used to think no one cared.  No 
                    one was keeping score.  I was wrong, 
                    wasn't I? 
                          (beat)
                    I'll see you round, Detective. 

      Carter takes a deep breath.  Comes around the corner. 

      He's gone.  She moves fast, covering the distance to the 
      bright lights of the boulevard. 


      Carter looks left.  Right.  No sign of him.  She lowers her 
      weapon, stalking through the crowds, hunting. 

      He's standing in a crowd of people on the corner.  For a
      second she looks right at him.  Then her eyes move on -- she
      knows his voice but not what he looks like.  She moves on. 
    He watches her pass.  After a moment he steps out into the
      street.  Walks in the opposite direction.  No one notices
      him.  No one except...                                                                                        68.

      The camera's dead eye is fixed as Reese moves further and 
      further down the sidewalk.
