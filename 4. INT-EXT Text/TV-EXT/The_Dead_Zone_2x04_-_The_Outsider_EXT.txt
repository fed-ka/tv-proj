          Lights are on, it almost looks inviting.  From inside we
          hear the canned laughter of a laugh track...





          Johnny arrives in his Jeep, stops by the standard post
          9/11 security checkpoint at the entrance to the lovely
            manicured grounds of the sprawling office park.  Two suits
          are leaving as Johnny is arriving...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi, my name's John Smith, I have
                        an appointment with Wendell Hahn.

                                        VETERAN GUARD
                          Identification, sir?

          Johnny hands the VETERAN GUARD his driver's license and
          as they touch... we hear the sound of a VISION starting
          and when Johnny looks up...


          SPLIT REALITY VISION: 

          The plaza is now lined on either side with angry PROTESTERS
          waving picket signs.  The two SUITS in present time
          continue to walk and talk like nothing's wrong.  The
          Protesters wave signs condemning the "Baby Killers." 
          Some signs have quotes from the Bible about paying the
          price for vanity.  Other Protesters hold up enlarged photos
          of babies with the Revivatin birth defect.  They are
          SHOUTING over each other, raging...

                                        VETERAN GUARD
                                (oblivious to the
                                  vision)
                        Thank-you, Mr. Smith.

          Purdy's Limo soars along the freeway.



          REVEAL the limo is crossing the field and approaching the
          Faith Heritage PRIVATE JET.  The engines are warming up.
          Carry over sound of ENGINE NOISE...





          A taxi with signage that establishes we're in Vancouver
          pulls to the curb on a run-down sidestreet... Two young
          JUNKIES watch as Johnny steps out, regarding a slip of
          paper in his hand.  Johnny surveys the bleak terrain...
          can this possibly be the right address?  As the driver
          pulls away... Johnny walks in the street-level entrance
          of a three story walk-up. 



          As Johnny comes out.  His mind works.  He can't waste any
          more time.  He dials his cell phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dana, it's Johnny.

                        Absolutely not.  Revivatin was
                          subjected to rigorous clinical
                        trials and was given full approval
                        by the FDA.  I plan on using it
                        myself.

                                        REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Do you have any direct comment on
                        Johnny Smith?

                                        KIM SANDELMAN
                        We feel Mr. Smith does not warrant
                        comment or consideration.  We
                        are, however, taking appropriate
                          action...

                        Shaw's on Main has a pharmacy...

          Johnny shakes his head, speaks softly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've made it worse.

                                        BRUCE
                        You can't tell that from two
                          pharmacies!

          Snap shots freeze framing the action every second or so. 
          We are watching from across the street as Claire exits
          the restaurant, upset, and gets into her car parked nearby. 
          Thomas exits the restaurant behind her, distressed, calling
          for her to wait.  Claire quickly drives off.  Johnny and
          Dana exit the restaurant a beat later.

          Johnny walks up to Thomas, who watches Claire's car go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened? 

                                        THOMAS
                        See for yourself.

          Thomas grabs Johnny's arm.  We RAMP around them and settle
          again, but we don't see what Johnny saw.

                                        THOMAS
                        We don't get together, anymore,
                        do we?
                                (Johnny doesn't answer)
                        DO WE?

                                (sotto)
                        I'll get the car.

          She moves away...

                        I knew it.  I knew this wouldn't
                        work.

                        Oh, you know all about that, don't
                        you?  You're the man who can change
                        time.  Lemme ask you something,
                        you ever consider that time would
                        get along just fine without you? 

          Off Johnny's look...

                                        THOMAS
                        Without her help, I may not ever
                        solve the algorithm.  And how
                        many more babies' lives will that
                        cost, you think, John?  How much
                        worse did we make the future today?  

          Dana pulls the car over and he gets in, slams the door...
          Johnny just stands there as we pull back slowly...

          Johnny's Jeep pulls into the drive.  He abruptly taps on
          the brakes.  Parked in the middle of his driveway is Claire
          Eisenhaus' CAR.  Same one that split from the restaurant.
