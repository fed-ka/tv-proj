Louis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching
for something. His foot finally rests on a broken tree
limb.
He places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right
hand.
LOUIS
This will do.
He throws it over to Quinn, who catches it in one swift
move.
QUINN
So what are you wanting to do?
Louis searches around for a stick of his own.
LOUIS
I figure we would train...
QUINN
Why?
Louis finds what he is looking for as he spins his limb
into attack position.
LOUIS
Because you dominate me every time-
(beat)
-ohh that sounded dirty
QUINN
So you want me to help you get an
advantage?
7.
LOUIS
No, I want you to help me put on a good
show. Everyone loves a good climax Quinn.
PARK-RIVERSIDE-CONTINUOUS
Zoey sits on a bench beside her best friend ANNA. Zoey is
completely distant, as Anna's words pass through her into
thin air.
ANNA
You know I don't like interjecting myself
into other people's affairs but-
ZOEY
(barley paying attention)
-But you're going to
ANNA
You let Rick do this to you.
ZOEY
(Snapping to it)
How so?
ANNA
You think you can change the men you are
with. You can't get into a relationship
with someone in the hopes that you can
mold them into the person you want them
to be.
ZOEY
Rick needed someone stable-
ANNA
-Rick needs castrated.
ZOEY
That's slightly strong.
ANNA
He was an asshole.
ZOEY
Misunderstood-
ANNA
-OK I'll meet you half
way...misunderstood asshole.
(beat)
You have been repeating the same cycle
your whole entire life.

ZOEY
Now that's a little off base.

ANIMATED SEQUENCE
FLASHBACK
ZOEY 10 YEARS OLD
A young BOY is sitting on another little boy's head. It
looks like he is passing gas on him.
ANNA (V.O.)
Remember Billy, who used to give kids the
"dirty bomb"? You took it upon yourself
to change this behavior-
The boy is now doing the same to Zoey.
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
-This put you right in the cross-hairs to
be his next victim.
ZOEY 13 YEARS OLD
ZACK, a young teenager is selling drugs on the street
corner. His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well
as the customers coming up to buy from him. Think if
South Park was crossed with HBO's The Wire.
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug
dealer-
Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled "Rehab" on the door.
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
-You took it upon yourself to be his
personal savoir. What did it get you?
Zack is out with Zoey when a few of his old GANG FRIENDS
show up looking to collect. Zack opens his pockets to
show he doesn't have any dough on him.
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Well when Zach's old business partners
wanted to collect on a debt-
Zack slowly pushes Zoey toward them.
9.
A few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee
table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine.
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
- they used you to replace their missing
coffee table they broke during a drunken
party.
ZOEY 17 YEARS OLD.
A gang member looks directly into the camera. He smiles
showing his golden grille.
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
-And then you have Toothpick. What kind
of name is Toothpick?
ZOEY (V.O.)
It was his gang name.
ANNA (V.O.)
Of course.
It's prom night and Toothpick is in his "pimp" tux. He
takes a swig of his "40" while he dances with Zoey.
ANNA (CONT'D)
We won't talk about prom night. Needless
to say it wasn't romantic.
Toothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room. Toothpick is
standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed. It
appears he is urinating on her. It's hard to tell with
the black censor bar.
END SEQUENCE
BACK TO:
PARK-RIVERSIDE-PRESENT DAY
ZOEY
Exaggerations-
ANNA
-Accurate account of events... The story
of your romantic life-
ZOEY
-Unfair. Because these people need
someone who is going to sacrifice their
own needs for them.
10.
ANNA
Why?
ZOEY
Who else is going to do it? We're alone
in the universe. If we are going to make
it through this "crazy world" we need to
look out for each other.
ANNA
I think you use atheism and the whole "we
are alone in the universe" jive to
justify your actions.
(beat)
I regret taking you to see Dawkins
because you use that as a fall back to be
codependent.
ZOEY
First of all you are bitter about the
whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed
him your tits and got us kicked out-
ANNA
-You didn't even know the first thing
about "The God Delusion" until I gave you
a copy-
ZOEY
-And someone who was huge supporter turns
her back because Richard Dawkins didn't
like her nipple piercing-
ANNA
(playful banter)
-Enjoy your suite in hell non-believer-
ZOEY
(more banter)
-Enjoy your delusional life there fence
sitter. How about you pray to Thor to hit
me with a lighting bolt so I can be
removed from this asinine conversation.
ANNA
You're hiding behind this religious
debate because you don't want to admit
you have always gravitated toward the
"wrong type" of guy.
Zoey is staring off into space.
11.
ZOEY
(detached)
I actually stopped listening to you.
ANNA
What are you staring at?
Zoey points at Quinn and Louis, who are fighting with
tree limbs in the distance.
ZOEY
Who are those guys?
ANNA
The one closest to us is Quinn. Very
weird, socially awkward type of guy. I
don't know who his friend is.
ZOEY
What are they doing?
ANNA
I don't know. Looks like that stuff my ex-
Rob was into-
ZOEY
Oh that medieval rugby style game-
ANNA
-Yeah the made up sport from "Blood Of
Heroes"...Oh...Jugger!-
ZOEY
-Sounds pornographic.
(beat)
So Quinn? What else do you know about
him?
ANNA
Oh no you don't! This is exactly what I
was talking about!
Anna senses something in Zoey that she is trying to hide.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Wait a second? You've already established
contact with Quinn?
ZOEY
What is this MI-6?
ANNA
You have your sights on him already!
12.
ZOEY
No, I'm just curious.
ANNA
What happened?
DISSOLVE TO:
TITLE CARD: 2 HOURS AGO
PARK-RIVERSIDE-EARLIER
Zoey is overcome with emotion as she makes her way down
to the riverside. She is holding something tight in her
hand.
CLOSE UP-HAND
As her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm.
It appears this might have belonged to Rick.
PARK-RIVERSIDE
Still teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the
river. A gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it
slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench.
Zoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the
first time.
ZOEY
(making her way to the bench)
I'm so sorry
Quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up
the ring.
QUINN
(handing the ring back to her)
Is this yours?
She takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket.
ZOEY
Kinda... Again I'm so sorry.
QUINN
No need to apologize.
Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit.
13.
QUINN (CONT'D)
Do you want to sit?
ZOEY
(unsure)
OK?
Zoey sits, still apprehensive.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
(reaching her hand out)
I'm Zoey.
QUINN
(He returns the gesture)
Quinn.
(beat)
Zoey? Interesting.
ZOEY
Oh name? Yes, most people have
interesting stories behind their
names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure
why my parents did that.
QUINN
Very unique.
ZOEY
(smiles)
I suppose that's a compliment. So I've
seen you around school, but never
really...in...class...
QUINN
I don't go to Marshall, I live near the
campus though.
ZOEY
Oh, well so what do you do?
QUINN
As in profession? I don't really have
one.
ZOEY
Really? Rent is insane around here...
QUINN
Yeah, my father provides for me.
ZOEY
That's pretty cool. What's he into?
14.
QUINN
Everything.
ZOEY
An entrepreneur...That's awesome.
(beat)
Well...So do you like coming down here?
QUINN
To the river?
ZOEY
(smiles)
Yes where we are right now.
QUINN
I just needed to think.
ZOEY
Yeah me too. I just suffered a break up.
QUINN
My apologies.
ZOEY
No it's OK. I mean I'm over it.
QUINN
(laughs)
My head disagrees.
ZOEY
I'm sorry.
QUINN
It's really OK.
ZOEY
So what did you need to think about? I
mean if I'm not prying of course.
QUINN
No, I just have some problems.
(beat)
I'm not sure about my calling in life.
ZOEY
I'm not sure anyone is. You know if you
need a friend, I'd be glad to...well you
know...listen.
QUINN
I'd appreciate that. I don't have many
friends.
15.
ZOEY
I know.
(trying to double back)
I mean...I've seen you around
campus...you seem like a loner...I didn't
mean you were a loser. Loner is kind of
sexy, loser...well can kind of be
too...I'll stop.
QUINN
No, it's OK. I agree it never hurts to
have a friend.
ZOEY
So we can maybe go out to dinner if you
want?
QUINN
OK...
ZOEY
And I can pay, you know..make up for the
head...
QUINN
You really don't have to.
ZOEY
No I want to.
QUINN
OK.
ZOEY
Well...
(beat)
Good let's meet up tonight. My place,
7pm.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: 7PM
Zoey shuts the door and then turns to stop Quinn.
ZOEY
Sorry about Jack...
QUINN
I like him.
18.
Louis and Quinn walk out into a huge open field. Louis is
carrying a black tote bag that he drops on the ground.
LOUIS
Now this is a place for a climatic
battle.
QUINN
Not bad.
Quinn points at the bag
QUINN (CONT'D)
What's in the bag?
LOUIS
You will love this.
Louis goes to the tote bag and starts to unzip it.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
I went to the toy store last night and
picked these up.
He reaches into the bag and pulls out two "nurf" style
swords out.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
Nothing like our real stuff, but it will
do.
Louis throws one of the "swords" to Quinn.
QUINN
(catching it)
It's kind of lightweight..and silly.
23.
Louis comes over carrying his sword.
LOUIS
Come on give it a chance.
Louis comes at Quinn and his instinct kicks in. The two
begin their mock battle.
TREE
From behind a tree we see RYAN BLOOD for the first time.
He hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital
camera.
Quinn and Louis continue to practice unaware of the
unwanted attention.
Jack puts his arm around Anna, as to stop her for a
second.
26.
JACK
You know I hate him because it's my
nature but-
ANNA
-You think I hate him because of my
distrust of men?
JACK
Tragedy changes people, it effected Zoey
in one way...you in another.
ANNA
Yeah
(beat,smiles)
I became a "fag hag"
BACK TO:
Quinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field.
He seems as though he is in the middle of a trance.
QUINN
(monotone)
I am curious Yellow...
Louis walks up and throws a toy sword on Quinn's lap.
28.
LOUIS
What the hell are you talking about?
Quinn stands up and grabs the sword.
QUINN
Nothing really.
The two start to sword fight, but Quinn does not have his
heart in it.
LOUIS
You half asleep Quinn?
Quinn stops for a second and drops his sword down to his
side. Louis pokes Quinn in the chest with the tip of his
sword.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
Look at that ladies and gentleman the
apocalypse has begun.
Quinn sits down.
QUINN
Have you ever seen a movie?
Louis follows his lead.
LOUIS
I've seen plenty of movies.
QUINN
Really?
LOUIS
Yeah I watched "The Sorrow and The Pity"
at Marshal the other day. You know people
here have yet to figure out we are not
students.
QUINN
I think they have a pretty good idea.
LOUIS
So in all the times we have been here,
you haven't gone to the cinema?
QUINN
No...
LOUIS
Why not?
29.
QUINN
It's not what we are here to do.
LOUIS
In your bosses name, what is wrong with
you? You've got to enjoy yourself. You
might be chosen, but you have needs. We
all do.
QUINN
I have to stay focused.
LOUIS
You've also burned yourself out. You're
not going to be any good to me...
Louis gets up and reaches out to help Quinn
LOUIS (CONT'D)
...unless you take some "you" time.
Quinn takes Louis' hand and gets to his feet.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
Can we get back to the matter at hand?
Louis brings his sword back up into attack position.
Quinn is back to his "swashbuckling" self. The two battle
it out on the field, matching each other blow for blow.
Louis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In
the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey
holding hands.
31.
LOUIS
(to himself)
What do we have here?
Louis stands across the street, staring right into the
window of the cafe. He clearly sees Quinn and Zoey on a
date.
His eyes widen as their hands touch.
Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment
building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns
to face Quinn.
ZOEY
Why haven't I seen your place?
QUINN
My place isn't very exciting.
ZOEY
That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine
you having a vast Blu Ray collection.
QUINN
Blu Ray?
ZOEY
Wow...Quinn, you have to start enjoying
the world around you.
QUINN
You know I realized today you are right
about that.
ZOEY
So you're saying you want to come up
stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"?
QUINN
(laughs)
Uh...no. I'm still trying to get I am
Curious Yellow out of my head.
ZOEY
Yeah...sorry about that...
32.
QUINN
(smiles)
It's OK.
Suddenly, guided by instinct, Zoey kisses Quinn on the
lips. Quinn is completely thrown.
ZOEY
I...I..I'm sorry.
QUINN
No don't be.
ZOEY
I shouldn't have been that aggressive.
QUINN
No...it's OK.
ZOEY
OK?
QUINN
I need to get back though.
ZOEY
Puzzling...but I know...virgin and all-
QUINN
-Well...I mean...
ZOEY
That came out rude...I just mean...I
wanted to do it. I should have taken it
slower.
QUINN
It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.
ZOEY
You sure?
QUINN
Yes of course.
ZOEY
(worried)
I hope so.
Quinn slowly turns around and walks away. Zoey looks at
him like she is unsure if she will see him again.
33.
DUMPSTER
Meanwhile, leaning against the dumpster, Louis watches
the display unseen.
In almost a "romantic movie" way, Quinn runs toward
Zoey's apartment. When he reaches the door he knocks like
his life depends on it.
Anna swings the door open, she's obviously surprised to
see Quinn.
ANNA
What the hell?
You can hear Jack inside the apartment.
JACK (O.S.)
What the fuck?!? I want to watch Bring me
the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace!
QUINN
I need to see Zoey.
ANNA
What about tomorrow? Or never is good.
You hear Zoey off screen.
ZOEY (O.S.)
What's going on??
Zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
Quinn? What's wrong?
QUINN
I need to talk to you, it's important.
Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing
her right past Anna.
ANNA
Jesus Christ!
Anna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside.
38.
QUINN
I need to tell you everything. Anna is so
right.
ZOEY
What are you talking about? Anna is
right?
QUINN
I've not been honest with you about what
I do...or who I am.
ZOEY
OK?
QUINN
I need to come clean. I want you to trust
me. I want your friends to trust me.
ZOEY
(nervous laugh)
OK Quinn, just spit it out.
QUINN
OK
(beat)
I'm an archangel named Moroni and I
basically represent "light" or everything
that's good. Louis, my friend, represents
"darkness". Every seventy years we have
to fight to the death. If I win
everything stays the way it is. The world
continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes
on the role of the Antichrist and the
apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking
Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only
have a limited time left in this world...
(beat)
I want to spend that time with you.
Zoey is stunned, silent.
ZOEY
Oh honey...
Zoey touches his face.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
You must have a brain tumor or something.
You're obviously mentally ill.
QUINN
Zoey? I...
39.
Zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him.
ZOEY
Shhh. You need me more than ever.
Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She
leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes
Quinn inside of the apartment.
The last image we see is the apartment door slamming
behind them.
CUT TO:
DARKNESS
FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-YEARS EARLIER-DAY
Zoey, roughly 2 years old, sits in the floor of her
parent's home playing.
Her DAD, only seen from the waist down, walks in front of
Zoey with his bible in hand. He makes it to Zoey's MOM,
on the other side of the room
DAD
You're not even helping me!
MOM
I don't even know what you want!
DAD
I can't run my congregation with this
sickness!
MOM
The sickness is in your head.
DAD
You're too busy running around doing
whatever you feel like. I'm going to fall
apart and it's all on you.
FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-TEN YEARS LATER-DAY
Zoey, now 12, is going through some boxes in the closet.
Her head bumps a shelf and a box falls on her.
When she goes to pick up the box she finds a ton of VHS
tapes.
40.
She goes through the box looking at the labels: "Anna age
7" "Anna age 10" "Anna age 12".
FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER
The glow of Zoey's TV fills her face. We can neither see
nor hear what she is watching.
Zoey looks like she is about to throw up.
JUMP CUT TO:
Zoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the
same bench from earlier. Quinn stares out toward the
river. It's obvious he is pondering over his choices.
QUINN
I love being with you.
ZOEY
Me too.
QUINN
I can't renege on my responsibilities
with Louis though.
Zoey sits up.
ZOEY
You're not actually going to fight your
friend to the death are you?
QUINN
I know you don't understand this. We just
need to make the most of our time.
ZOEY
Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be
normal. This is just a delusion.
QUINN
I know you don't understand. I just need
to go see Louis today.
43.
ZOEY
I understand that.
Quinn leans his head back. He catches something out of
the corner of his eye.
QUINN'S POV
Quinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree. He is taking
video of Quinn and Zoey with a "smart phone".
PARK-RIVERSIDE
Quinn jolts up. Zoey is alarmed.
ZOEY
What is it?
Quinn doesn't answer. He gets up and runs to the...
TREE
Quinn looks behind the tree, but Ryan is long gone. Zoey
comes up from behind, she places her hand on Quinn's
shoulder.
ZOEY
What was wrong?
QUINN
My neighbor Ryan Blood...looks like he's
spying on me.
ZOEY
What are you talking about?
QUINN
I need to go see Louis.
Quinn runs toward Louis' apartment. His KNOCKS sound like
a jackhammer on the door.
Louis answers.
46.
QUINN
We have a problem.
LOUIS
You're right. We do.
Louis moves slightly and we see Ryan Blood in the
background.
Louis slowly closes the door in a stunned Quinn's face.
Quinn is on a pay phone, he's shaking. At this point he
is lost on what his next move should be.
47.
QUINN
Ryan Blood!
ZOEY
You mentioned that earlier. What is going
on?
QUINN
He's with Louis. They're planning to kill
me.
ZOEY
I thought that was the whole plan.
QUINN
No it's...this isn't like Louis. I think
he is trying to cheat his way to a win.
ZOEY
Why don't you come over here.
QUINN
I can't!
ZOEY
Come on Quinn get a grip. Just calm down
and come over here.
QUINN
You're right.
ZOEY
OK so just come on over and we'll talk.
QUINN
No I mean you're right. I need to get
control of myself. I have a destiny. I
need to figure out my next move.
ZOEY
Quinn? No wait-
Quinn hangs up the phone.
ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT
Zoey slowly drops her cell phone to the floor. Jack picks
up the folder Zoey set aside.
JACK
What is it?
48.
ZOEY
I don't know. He's losing it.
Jack hands her the folder.
JACK
You need to look at this.
Zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading.
JACK (CONT'D)
I spent a lot of time gathering that
information.
ZOEY
So what is all this?
JACK
Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were
orphans.
Zoey is flipping through documents.
JACK (CONT'D)
Quinn displayed some erratic behavior
from the beginning. One of the staff
members was Mormon and they would read
stories to Quinn out of the Book Of
Mormon. That employee was later fired,
but a seed was planted in Quinn's head.
He kept going on about how he and Louis
were meant to fight to the death. Some of
the children at the time claim Louis
would encourage this behavior. He
probably thought this was Quinn's attempt
at playing.
(beat)
As things continued the staff at the
orphanage thought Quinn needed help
beyond what they could offer. They sent
Quinn to a hospital.
Zoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the
floor.
ZOEY
You're not telling me anything I didn't
already know.
ANNA
That makes it worse. You're going to
continue this now that you know for a
fact that he is nuts?
49.
ZOEY
I'm too far into this now. I don't have a
choice.
Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the
folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table.
JACK
Why don't you let us save you? Please
Zoey.
ZOEY
Let me be guys.
Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack
exhausted.
ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING
The apartment is quiet. Anna no where in sight, more than
likely in her room sleeping.
Jack is passed out on the couch. Zoey walks in, it's
obvious she hasn't slept all night.
She scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch. She
proceeds to pick up the file folder.
She starts thumbing through the documents. After a few
moments she finds one of interest.
She reaches over and pushes Jack.
JACK
(rousing up)
Ehhh...what? You better be a hot bear of
a man.
Jack looks up and sees Zoey.
JACK (CONT'D)
Or Zoey...What do you need hun?
Zoey hands Jack a document from the folder.
ZOEY
What's this?
Jack's eyes try to focus on the document.
JACK
Looks like a room list from the psych
hospital.
50.
ZOEY
I gathered that. Under Quinn's room...
JACK
Quinn and his roommate is listed.
ZOEY
Quinn's roommate was Ryan Blood?
JACK
Yeah...looks that way.
ZOEY
Ah fuck.
JUMP CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: 1 DAY LEFT
Louis stares out into the open field. A gust of wind
blows through his hair.
Ryan Blood comes up from behind and pats Louis on the
back.
RYAN BLOOD
We need to talk.
Louis turns around to face Ryan.
LOUIS
About?
RYAN BLOOD
Strategy.
LOUIS
Strategy?
RYAN BLOOD
Yes. I have a method-
LOUIS
-I have to hear this.
RYAN BLOOD
A 12 point system-
LOUIS
(confused)
- Like 12 steps?
51.
RYAN BLOOD
Exactly. It's a sure fire plan to throw
Quinn off of his game
Louis laughs.
LOUIS
Oh I am so all ears.
RYAN BLOOD
Well the first thing you need is a battle
cry.
LOUIS
Excuse me? A battle cry?
RYAN BLOOD
Yes a battle cry. Every great warrior has
one.
LOUIS
And a battle cry is going to give me the
advantage in battle?
RYAN BLOOD
Of course it will. Why don't you try one
out?
LOUIS
What?
RYAN BLOOD
Yeah, try one out right now. It's
liberating.
LOUIS
I'd rather not.
RYAN BLOOD
Come on.
LOUIS
(extremely confused)
Right here?
RYAN BLOOD
Here I'll go first-
Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being
sodomized.
LOUIS
That was...interesting.
52.
RYAN BLOOD
See?
(beat)
Your turn.
Louis looks around.
LOUIS
So right now?
RYAN BLOOD
Of course.
Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes
out more like frightened little girl.
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
Oh come on! That sounds like you are
scared of the battle. What? Are you
scared of Quinn? You probably are-
Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly
better.
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
That's good! Come on!
Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to
jump back.
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
Yes that's what I'm talking about!
Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them.
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
(noticing Quinn)
Quinn?!? Good to see you!
Quinn grabs Louis' arm.
QUINN
We need to talk.
LOUIS
(to Ryan)
Excuse me for a second.
Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some
distance away from Ryan.
QUINN
I know that guy and I don't trust him.
53.
LOUIS
I don't trust you anymore.
QUINN
Your new friend is dangerous.
LOUIS
So is yours.
QUINN
Leave her out of this.
LOUIS
You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn?
QUINN
It's over. This whole thing is nuts. I'm
walking away.
LOUIS
Let me walk away from you first then.
Louis starts to walk away from Quinn. He turns around as
he continues to walk backwards.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
I'm coming at you! You are in this game
like it or not!
Zoey's car pulls up in front of an historic brick
building. She slowly gets out and starts to look the
structure over. It's almost like she is trying to assess
if she has the right place.
Zoey runs outside and makes it to her car. She hits the
roof of her vehicle in anger
ZOEY
What a fucking nut house!
JAKE (O.S.)
(monotone)
Excuse me!
Zoey jumps up and screams. She sees Jake standing
creepily behind her.
ZOEY
What!
JAKE
(monotone)
I know the young boys you speak of.
ZOEY
(doesn't care)
And?
JAKE
(monotone)
I was here when Quinn got sent to the
mental hospital. It was like the other
one set it up.
ZOEY
Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn
appear crazy?
56.
JAKE
(monotone)
They both believed the same thing. Louis
was just smart enough to hide it.
ZOEY
There is more to it than that.
JAKE
(monotone)
I don't understand
ZOEY
Listen "Robot Boy", where did this whole
belief come from? This isn't something
two kids come up with on their own.
JAKE
(monotone)
Yes I believe a seed was planted.
ZOEY
Exactly. I heard there was an employee
that got fired for sharing Mormon
mythology with the boys.
JAKE
(monotone)
No. Off base. He's not the right one.
INTERCUT
Ryan pulls Zoey up to her feet. He presses the gun
against her head.
Louis walks out into the middle of the field. He's
dressed in a full ninja outfit.
He unsheathes his katana.
LOUIS
What do you think Zoey? I'm a ninja!
ZOEY
(struggling under Ryan's grip)
You're fucking crazy!
64.
LOUIS
That's not nice! I think I look good.
ZOEY
I think you're a fucking nut bag.
LOUIS
This is going to be fun. You'll see.
ZOEY
Mrs Rhodes? Does that name ring a bell?
RYAN BLOOD
My aunt?
LOUIS
Yeah...yeah...she played a part in the
game. Tell us something we don't know.
You're such a sexy Nancy Drew right now.
ZOEY
Go fuck yourself.
LOUIS
Or a foul mouthed Velma. That gets me so
hard. Does that get you hard Ryan?
RYAN BLOOD
Can we go back to my aunt please?
ZOEY
Mrs. Rhodes? What about her? Other than
she fucked you guys up. She taught you,
Louis how to play it straight. Then she
has you fuck Quinn over.
RYAN BLOOD
She didn't fuck Quinn over. She just
helped him out.
ZOEY
Yeah by getting him in contact with you.
RYAN BLOOD
She knew one day it was all going to
catch up with her. She trained me to get
into the game. She told me it was my
destiny.
ZOEY
Is that why she placed you in that
hospital?
65.
RYAN BLOOD
She was my caretaker. She told me she was
sending me someone. Someone I would have
to guide on to the right path.
ZOEY
Guys I have let my parents fuck me up.
There comes a time though where you have
to go out on your own. Take
responsibility for your own life.
RYAN BLOOD
There is a much bigger purpose. You'll
see.
ZOEY
This whole thing was to carry out some
delusional woman's master plan. She
doesn't even remember who she is at this
point. I went to see her...she wanted me
to take off my shirt.
Louis is irritated.
LOUIS
Will you shut up?!? You are ruining my
climatic fight.
Louis spies Quinn in the distance.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
Showtime.
START CHOIR MUSIC
Quinn lowers his katana, it brushes against the blades of
grass. Louis follows suit as he slowly walks to meet
Quinn in the middle.
The two warriors stand on opposite sides of the battle
field.
END CHOIR MUSIC
Quinn looks over and sees Zoey.
QUINN
Let her go!
Ryan grabs her tighter.
RYAN BLOOD
Not yet...
66.
QUINN
(To Louis)
Is this the game you want to play?
LOUIS
I'm not going to lose this time.
ZOEY
(To Quinn)
I thought you didn't believe this shit
anymore.
QUINN
There's more going on than you realize
Zoey.
ZOEY
This is fucked. Quinn you're not 5000
years old. You were born in an orphanage.
None of this makes sense.
LOUIS
Lady, it would look weird if we roamed
the earth for 5000 years without facing a
mortal death! We keep getting reborn,
sometimes we even switch physical form.
Thanks for coming to the game late missy!
ZOEY
That makes total fucking sense. Color me
stupid!
QUINN
(to Louis)
You don't get it do you.
LOUIS
What?!?
QUINN
If you win...you're not becoming the
antichrist.
LOUIS
What are you talking about??
QUINN
It's
Ryan...it's always been Ryan.
LOUIS
(To Ryan)
What is he talking about?
67.
RYAN BLOOD
He's pitting us against each other.
QUINN
I'm going to be honest with you Louis.
I've always been honest.
LOUIS
Yeah sometimes to a fault.
QUINN
We have always played this game as honest
as we could. We never did anything to
undermine the other. Despite what you
represent, you have moral code.
(beat)
You are not acting with in that code
today.
LOUIS
I'm tired of losing...
QUINN
You're losing right now. Your actions,
you can't win like this. Not acting this
way.
LOUIS
I'm tired of you. I'm going to end it!
Louis goes over to Ryan. He trades his sword in for
Ryan's gun.
Ryan holds the katana to Zoey's throat. Louis points the
gun dead at Quinn.
QUINN
You going to shoot me?
LOUIS
It's the endgame.
Tense moment as Louis aims the gun at Quinn.
SUDDENLY he spins and shoots Ryan dead in the head.
Ryan falls and Zoey gets free.
Louis looks at Quinn and then throws the gun far out into
the field.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
OK...I guess I do have some morals.
68.
Zoey gets her bearings.
ZOEY
What the fuck!
QUINN
Zoey go home. We need to finish this.
Louis walks over to Ryan and grabs his katana.
ZOEY
No you don't. Guys what are you doing?
LOUIS
Go home girl!
ZOEY
Are you being serious?
Quinn stops and turns toward Zoey.
QUINN
I will always love you. You have to go
though.
ZOEY
If you don't walk away from this field
right now, you will lose me. I will not
be in your corner. I will call for help.
They will stop you.
QUINN
Go...
ZOEY
Quinn...last chance.
Zoey walks over to Ryan's body. She searches till she
finds her cell phone in his front pocket.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
I will call the police Quinn...
Quinn looks at Zoey, dead in the eyes.
QUINN
Goodbye.
Quinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to
attack position and Louis follows suit.
ZOEY
(tearing up)
Wow...yeah goodbye.
69.
Quinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to
stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away.
Quinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant.
Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by
the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers
film.
We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at
it until we can't tell who is who.
OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLE
Zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone.
CLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONE
She starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position
to hit send.
OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD
Zoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks
back toward where the battle is going on.
She starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog.
Finally the jog turns into a full run.
OPEN FIELD
When she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All
that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an
empty ninja suit.
Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana.
ZOEY
(laughs to herself)
I am Curious:Yellow
(beat)
Goodbye boys...
Zoey stares out into the open field. She feels reborn.
She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her
beyond the horizon.
CUT TO:
BLACKNESS
TITLE CARD: 70 YEARS LATER
70.
Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her
great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down
beside her grandmother.
JENNIFER
Hey Grandma.
ZOEY
Hey...
JENNIFER
You look solemn.
ZOEY
Just sitting here...thinking...
JENNIFER
What are you thinking about?
ZOEY
I've had a great life. A wonderful
husband, children, grandchildren...
(motions to Jennifer)
...great grandchildren...I spent so much
of my youth being angry. I wish I could
relive my life now, knowing what I know.
JENNIFER
You do have a lot of wisdom.
71.
ZOEY
I've tried to pass it on to you.
JENNIFER
You've taught me a lot.
ZOEY
Just remember, you can believe what you
want to believe Jennifer. Live by what
ever moral code you want to live by. Just
make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem
from anger or past tragedies.
(beat)
Let it come from your heart.
Jennifer turns around.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
What is it?
JENNIFER
My new boyfriend. The one I wanted you to
meet.
Zoey turns around to see the BOYFRIEND walking toward
them. It shouldn't come to a surprise that he looks a lot
like Quinn.
Jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the
waist. He reaches his hand out to Zoey.
BOYFRIEND
(nervous)
Nice to meet to ma'am.
ZOEY
(shakes his hand)
Likewise.
Jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with
Zoey.
JENNIFER
We better get going. We're going to grab
something to eat.
ZOEY
(to the boyfriend)
I didn't catch your name.
BOYFRIEND
I'm so sorry. I'm being rude.
72.
JENNIFER
(laughs)
He can be like that.
BOYFRIEND
I'm Louis.
Zoey is stunned.
JENNIFER
(to Zoey)
You OK?
ZOEY
Yeah I'm fine.
(snapping out of it)
Enjoy dinner.
JENNIFER
See you later on.
BOYFRIEND
(making eye contact with Zoey, smiling)
Nice to meet you.
ZOEY
(returning contact, and smiles)
Likewise.
The two lovebirds walk away. Zoey stares at them for a
second. A it "can't be look" crosses her face.
START "DONE AND DUSTED'
CLOSE UP-ZOEY'S FACE
Zoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is
more out there. Things that we don't fully understand.
The smile then fades.
Her final look is that of content. And then as Done and
Dusted plays we...
FADE OUT.
