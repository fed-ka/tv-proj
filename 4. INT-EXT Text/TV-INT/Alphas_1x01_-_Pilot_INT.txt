      A drab strip of corridor that connects an underground parking 

      lot to the FEDERAL COURTHOUSE in Manhattan.  

      A man whom we will know as THE WITNESS - a Vietnamese man in 
      an inexpensive suit and tie - is being led by his lawyer and 
      two of NYPD s finest to a service elevator.

      The Witness is sweating bullets, nervously glancing at every 

      open door or passing sound. A loud CLANG makes him flinch.

      It s just the service elevator, coming to a stop.  


      The COPS look at each other, roll their eyes.  Talk about 
      paranoid.  




      Elevator doors slide open.  The Witness and his escorts exit, 
      walk past a glass divider and a bank of metal detectors 
      manned by NYPD.  Clearly a very secure area.  As they exit 

      the elevator, we hear pre-lapped dialogue, the mannered lingo 
      of a depositional hearing --

                                  PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                    ...in previous testimony you... excuse 

                    me... you told police investigators 
                    Frankel and Pierce that from March 
                    2005 to...uh...

      The Witness heads towards a set of double doors, warily 
      eyeing his destination.  

      NOW WE REVEAL 

      A man in a suit, watching this procession with a keen eye.  
      His name is MOREZ, and we will remember him because of his 
      distinctive METAL BRIEFCASE, with an enigmatic symbol etched 

      into its side.  

      Morez watches as the Witness disappears through the doors of 
      the deposition room. He pulls out a cell phone and dials.  We 
      hear the phone connect, and Morez presses a button.   

      The sound we hear is muffled, through a phone speaker, but it 
      is still instantly recognizable as one of those ubiquitous, 
      annoying RINGTONES.  


























































          SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              2.



                                  PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                    ... from March 05 to November 07, you 
                    received more than 12.5 tons of nearly 
                      pure-grade heroin from the defendant, 
                    Juan Carlos Sanchez.  



      A simple, box-like space, with a large conference table in 
      the center, chairs all around.  No windows, no contact with 
      the outside world except a single, small vent in the wall 
      blowing air back into the room.  THIS ROOM IS SEALED TO THE 
      OUTSIDE WORLD.

      A sweaty PROSECUTOR looks up from his notes as another lawyer 
      adjusts the DEPOSITION MICROPHONE, bolted into the table in 
      front of the witness. The witness stares at the Prosecutor, 
      terrified and mute.    

                                  PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                    Will you please confirm that the 
                    testimony you gave these officers was 
                    both truthful and accurate? 

      The witness swallows hard, then whispers something to his 
      LAWYER, seated next to him.  They briefly confer. 

      The Prosecutor exchanges a look with his Assistant US 
      Attorney.  Is this guy gonna roll on them or not?  The 
      Assistant shrugs.  

                                  PROSECUTOR (CONT D)
                            (forcefully)
                    Mr. Duong, your plea agreement with 
                    the prosecution is predicated on your 
                    testimony against Mr. Sanchez. Should 
                    you decline a response, there will be 
                      consequences and you will have to live 
                    with them.  

      The witness nods.  He leans forward to speak, clearing his 
      throat...

      And at that moment, at the precise instant that he opens his 
      mouth...

      We HEAR SOMETHING.  

      Not loud, but distinctive and sharp, the "plock" of a pebble 
      bouncing off your windshield when you're doing seventy on the 
      highway.  
























































































































          SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              3.



      The lawyers flinch, everyone looks around, trying to find the 
      source...

      Except the Witness.

      He does nothing.  His eyes go glassy, rolling back a bit.  
      And then a trickle of blood snakes its way down from a dark, 
      red spot, dead center between his eyes.  

                                  PROSECUTOR (CONT D)
                    Mr. Duong?

      The Witness falls forward, head thumping against the 
      microphone.  And that's it.


      He's dead. The screen goes black.  And over it, we hear a 
      voice. 

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    The most magnificent creation the 
                    universe has ever known is the human 
                    brain.  

      MONTAGE BEGINS

      The line between what is possible and what is real will be 
      razor thin on this show, as evidenced in the following 
      montage.  The images that come up are a combination of ACTUAL 
      VIDEOS CULLED FROM YOUTUBE and stuff that we create to look 
      like the same.

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And yet, the brain remains a mystery 
                    to us.  Most of us live our lives in 
                    ignorance of its potential.

      - We see through the window of a 24 Hour gym in a strip mall, 
      where people are marching like automatons on a row of 
      stairmasters.  

      - We see face-masked workers on an assembly line repeating 
      the same task over and over.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But not everyone.  A few have 
                    dedicated themselves to exploring the 
                    outer limits of their most miraculous 
                      possession.  

      And now we see the real eye-grabbing stuff.  

      - A YOUNG BOY, age 7, plays Rachmaninoff to perfection. 












































































































































































          SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              4.



      - A YOGI, sitting in the lotus position, lowers his heart 
      rate to thirty.

      - KASPAROV defeats Deep Blue in a game of Chess. 

      - TIGER WOODS bounces a golf ball on his club in an amazing 
      display of dexterity.

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Musical skill, computation, heightened 
                      concentration, control of the 
                    autonomic nervous system, uncanny 
                    recall of vast information -- the 
                    potential of the human brain seems 
                    infinite.

      - A man in his twenties named GARY BELL paints a perfect, 
        photo-realistic portrait of Manhattan from memory. 

      - A HYPNOTIST gets a NEWLYWED COUPLE to act like chickens in 
      front of a packed audience.

      - MICHEL GONDRY solves a Rubik s cube with his feet in ten 
      seconds. 

      - Some KID performs an amazing quarters shot, bouncing ten 
      coins into ten separate cups with a single toss.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Such gifts come at a price, however.  
                    More often than not, these increased 
                      capabilities carry with them a 
                    crippling deficiency in other areas. 




      On the face of it, there is nothing unusual about the BELL 
      household.   But as we follow SANDRA BELL (early fifties, 
      single mom) carrying a load of laundry, we begin to notice 
      something strange; THE NOISE. 

      Every electronic appliance in the house is on; the stereo, 
      the TV, even a white noise machine in a hallway.  In the 
      center of this cacophony is the painter with the photographic 
      memory, Sandra's only son, GARY, a 25-year-old, highly-
      functioning autistic.   

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    ...the ability to memorize and 
                    reproduce enormous amounts of 
                      information, flawlessly...

      Gary sits in the living room, playing his PSP and watching 
      the weather channel at the same time.   The sound doesn't 
      seem to faze him in the slightest.  As Sandra gets him ready 
      to go to work, we sense just how difficult it can be, caring 
      for a grown man who is still in many ways a child. 

                                  ROSEN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...is coupled with a reduction in 
                    emotional understanding, a condition 
                    often described under the rubric of 
                    autism. 



      NINA THEROUX opens her eyes and rolls over in bed to discover 
      her latest conquest is already up and getting dressed.  

      Nina s in her early thirties, sexy, and powerful in ways that 
      most women can only imagine.  She has a confidence that comes 
      from getting exactly what she wants, all the time-- 

      Like this guy.  He s a decade younger with model good looks.   
      He glances over at Nina who is naked beneath the sheets.  He 
      seems confused, almost like he doesn't remember how he got 
      here.  Before he can finish throwing on his outfit, a parking 
      attendant uniform, Nina motions for him to come back to bed.  
      He is hesitant.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    Through processes we are only 
                    beginning to understand, they can 
                    affect the states of another s brain, 
                    forcing whatever response they desire. 

      Nina places her hand on his arm, says a few words.  He leans 
      in and kisses her, starts pulling off his clothes again.   

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    These abilities are the most powerful, 
                    and accordingly the most frightening 
                    to contemplate. 



      We find Rosen at his desk, typing the opening chapter of a 
      book on an old Smith Corona daisy wheel, clearly an 
      affectation given the fancy desktop sitting idle a few feet 
      away.    


                                  ROSEN 
                          (reading to himself)
                    For while this book is intended to be 
                    a work of science, recounting case 
                    studies and my conclusions, the 
                    secrets that will be revealed might 
                    change the very nature of what it 
                    means to be human.   
                          (backing up, reading it 
                            again, making changes)
                      ...inherently make it.. Change the 
                    very... change the fabric of...

      He suddenly stops, yanks the piece of paper out of the 
      typewriter.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Ugh.  So maudlin, Leigh.  

      He crumples up that page and tosses it.  He takes the rest of 
      a stack he has written and straightens them into a neat pile, 
      the top page marked  INTRODUCTION.   He opens a locked 
      drawer, then drops the new pages down on about seven hundred 
      others he will never show anyone. 

      He locks the drawer, then picks up an unrelated FOLDER  
      sitting on his desk.  He gets up to leave, the file under his 
      arm. 



      Rosen crosses through a mundane-looking office space -- grey 
      carpeting, utilitarian furniture and a bank of fluorescents 
      that flicker and buzz.  The space could have been a dentist s 
      office in a former life. 

      Along the way, he peeks his head into an open office.

      Inside, NINA is taking off designer sunglasses and shaking 
      out her hair as she faces another work week.  Rosen holds up 
      the folder.

                                  ROSEN
                    Good morning.  Conference room, ten 
                    minutes. 

      Nina grimaces, and Rosen continues to...



      Plastic table and chairs, candy and soda vending machines 
      against one wall.  

      Gary Bell is putting his lunch in the refrigerator, clearly 
      marked  Gary s Lunch Please DON T TOUCH  in his Mom s 
        handwriting.  

      Rosen puts a kettle on the range and grabs a mug and tea bag.

                                  ROSEN
                    How was your weekend, Gary?

                                  GARY
                    I have ascended to the rank of Master 
                    Sergeant by unlocking achievements on 
                    the arid sand dunes of Arochim.  

                                  ROSEN
                      Wonderful.  Ten minutes, okay?  

      Gary nods and Rosen exits.    



      Harken enters, now on his second cup of coffee.  As he 
      hurries towards his desk, he almost collides with the one 
      member of our team that we still haven t met-- 

      RACHEL MYERS.  

      You can understand why someone might walk right into her.  
      She s a classic wallflower, shy and quiet.  She s in the 
        purposefully modest dress and head scarf of a woman from an 
      orthodox Jewish home.

                                  HARKEN
                    Jesus.  You scared the piss outta me.    

      Rachel steps out of his way, her eyes on the floor.  She 
      doesn t say a word.  On her neck we notice a discrete 
      ELECTRONIC DEVICE resting against her larynx.

      It s a strange little bit of technology, more advanced 
      looking that one might expect.  This is something that will 
      be commonplace in the world of Section 8.

                                  HARKEN
                    You never showed up Saturday.  We 
                    coulda used you.  

      Rachel still doesn t respond.  

                                  HARKEN
                    You got an explanation for that?


                                  NINA (O.S.)
                    Sabbath.  

      Nina walks by.  Harken looks at her, quizzically. 

                                  NINA
                      Saturday s the Sabbath, you idiot.  
                    She can t work.  

      Rachel gives Harken a look, then scurries away to her office.  
      Harken shakes his head.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Like I m supposed to know that.  Girl 
                    doesn t say a word.   



      Rachel sits in her office, marking up a copy of the New Dehli 
      Post with a hi-liter.  Her office is cluttered with 
      computers, magazines, newspapers and non-fiction books.   She 
      spends her days looking for  chatter  that might signify 
      alpha activity, a job she attacks with focused precision.  

      Rosen appears at the door and waves the folder. 

                                  ROSEN
                    Great find, my dear.  Looks like we 
                    may have something.  

      Rachel allows herself a satisfied smile.

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    We have a witness, a small-time drug

        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              10.





      Nina, Harken, Rachel and Gary sit around the conference 
      table, Rosen paces, presenting the case Rachel found.  

                                  ROSEN 
                    Murdered during a deposition, the 
                    cause of death a bullet to the brain. 


      The tone at this meeting is as informal as you can imagine.  
      People talking over each other, getting up to get coffee and 
      returning. They talk about the things that people who work 
      together talk about;  the parking, the kitchen and who 
        does/doesn t clean it up, gossip.   

      Gary is particularly bad at waiting his turn, randomly 
        interrupting to announce some pertinent piece of information, 
      like, for example, that he detests any type of cheese that is 
      white and that cat dander is corrosive to leather.  


      Nina reads a magazine while sipping from a glass of water 
      fizzling with two alka-seltzer.  

      The world of the office should feel improvisational in tone, 
      hyper-real, even mundane at points; a sharp contrast with 
      some of the extraordinary things we will see.   

                                  ROSEN
                    No one in the room saw a shot fired.  
                      Ballistics are inconclusive.  A 
                    classic, locked-room mystery.

      Harken notices Nina sipping her alka seltzer cocktail.  

                                  HARKEN
                    You re a little old to be out drinking 
                    like a sorority sister, dontcha think?  

                                  NINA
                    Bite me.

                          (nodding to Rachel)
                    The reportage in today s paper leaves 
                    key details out, but Rachel s source 
                    inside the DOJ confirm her suspicions. 
                    She believes there is something here.  
                    And so do I.  
































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              11.



                                  HARKEN
                    You sure this is an alpha, and not 
                    something else?  

                                  ROSEN
                    I m sure of nothing in this green 
                    world, Bill, but we get nowhere 
                    without striving forward, am I right?  
                          (beat)
                    You know the drill.  Let s get to it 
                    people.  

      Nina yawns.  



      The Courthouse is swarming with police officers, but many of 
      them stop what they re doing to check Nina out.  She knows 
      how to work it, she likes the attention.  She responds with a 
      flirty smile, a wink to the cuter guys in their blues.

                                  GARY
                      Construction on the Foley Square 
                      courthouse was completed April 
                    seventh, 1935 with additional 
                      renovations made in 1971 and 1993.

      On Gary s IPHONE, his fingers flip through page after page of 
      blueprints.  He doesn t blink.  He is literally memorizing 
      the plans of the building as they walk.




























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              12.



                                  NINA
                    That s even more interesting than the 
                    stuff about mineral insulated wiring.  
                    How about you tell me where the 
                      Deposition Room is?  

      Gary leads Nina to a door marked STAIRWELL at the back of the 
      lobby.  They slip through it.  



      At the FBI Building in Manhattan, we pan through the bustle 
      of one of the nation s busiest field offices: phones ringing,  
      people working, Agents heading in and out on important cases, 
      TO FIND...

      BILL HARKEN making his way through the rows of cubicles.  
      He s uncomfortable, avoiding eye contact, particularly when 
      he is recognized by a former coworker.  He can feel the 
      conspiratorial whispers behind his back. The occasional nod 
      hello is always awkward. 


      Whatever made him leave, it s not something he s proud of.  

                                  QUINN (O.S.)
                    Nobody s asking who did this, we all 
                    know who did it.  



      Harken sits behind the desk that bears the nameplate of  
      AGENT GERALD QUINN, sifting through a box of files marked 
      Sanchez.  We hear Quinn s voice, although he is out of view.  

                                  QUINN (O.S.)
                    Sanchez is the biggest narcotics 
                      trafficker in the world, two of his 
                    top guys in South East Asia flipped, 
                    so he s taking em out before they 
                    testify.  

      Reveal Agent QUINN, a fit guy in his late fifties, rolling 
      his back on one of those big red playground balls, trying to 
      loosen up. 

                                  QUINN
                    Only question is who he paid to pull 
                    the guy s ticket.   

                                  HARKEN
                    How it got done is another question.   














































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              13.



                                  QUINN
                    Inside job.  Someone in the room. 

      Harken, glancing the CSI report, seems skeptical.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Slug was from a thirty-aught-six.  You 
                    telling me someone in the room had a 
                    rifle?

                                  QUINN
                    I m saying an inside job.  Only thing 
                    that makes sense. 
                          (switching subjects)
                    How s Nancy, by the way?

                                  HARKEN
                    Dead to me. 

                                  QUINN
                    Nice, mother of your child. Very nice. 

      Quinn gets to his feet and continues his stretching, touching 
      his toes, extending his arms above his head.

                                  QUINN
                    She letting you see Anna?  

                                  HARKEN
                    She doesn t make it easy. Could you 
                    please stop with that?   

      Quinn has now moved onto legs, doing some pretty silly 
      looking knee lifts.  

                                  QUINN
                    This is why I can sit in a chair all 
                    day.  You ll see, when you get to be 
                    my age.  You ll wish you did this. 

                                  HARKEN
                          (re: the files)
                    There s nothing in here. Not one lead.  
                    You guys punting this case? 

                                  QUINN
                    You kidding?  DOJ s going nuts. The 
                    other witness, the dead guy s partner.  
                    A Mr. Non Duc Minh.  They got him in 
                      protective custody, secret service, 
                    the works.  Believe me, nobody s 
                    punting.

      Harken packs up a few files.  After a beat...

                                  QUINN
                    What do you do, Bill?  

                                  HARKEN
                    Huh?  

                                  QUINN

                    I mean, seriously. One week you come 
                    in here, asking for a file on some 100 
                    year old Soviet chess master, then its 
                    info on an enemy combatant at 
                      Guantanamo.  Now this thing.  

                                  HARKEN
                    It s a job.    

                                  QUINN
                    You get booted from here, one step 
                    from ending up behind bars, and next 
                    thing you re working for the NSA?  
                    What exactly are you doing for these 
                    people, Bill?    

      Harken gives him a look. A look between two old friends that 
      says  Don t ask.   Quinn shrugs.  

                                  QUINN
                    Fine, I m tired of grilling you.  Get 
                    out of here.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Thanks for this, Gerry.  
                          (holding up the CSI 
                            report)
                    I m gonna take this with...

      Quinn nods, watches as Harken goes.  He s concerned.  



      The same room we began our story in, preserved in a frozen 
      state of chaos.  Chairs overturned from the panic following 
      the witness s death. The microphone has been unscrewed from 
      the table. And a taped chalk outline where he slumped over.   

                                  NINA (O.S.)
                    I think I know which seat he was in.

      Reveal Nina, in the middle of the room, poking around. Gary 
      is just standing there, staring at the wall.  Her gallows 
      humor is lost on him.  

                                  NINA
                    You got something for me?  

                                  GARY
                    Yes. I m thinking.

                                  NINA
                    Cause I got no clue what you re

                                  GARY
                    Be quiet, I m thinking.  

                                  POLICE DETECTIVE (O.S.)
                    Hey!

      They both turn to look, a young, handsome POLICE DETECTIVE 
      pulls the tape aside and enters the room.  

                                  POLICE DETECTIVE
                    You can t be in here.  This area s 
                      restricted.  

                                  NINA
                    It s not a problem.  

      The detective cuts her off.  Repeats his question more 
      emphatically.

                                  POLICE DETECTIVE
                    Whattya mean not a problem?  It s a 
                    big problem, who are you people?   

      When Gary answers, it s a stream of information delivered in 
      the mechanical cadence of someone with no internal filter.   
      It's both disconcerting and funny.

                                  GARY
                    We are part of a secret organization, 
                    and we cant tell you about it.  If you 
                    don t let us do stuff then we can t 
                    stop the bad guys and everybody will 
                    die, so stop bugging us.

                          (cutting Gary off)
                    Gary, that s enough.
                          (to the detective)

      She puts a firm hand on his shoulder.  But this isn't a 
      friendly or suggestive move, it has a purpose.  

      CLOSE ON HER FINGERTIPS

      As they press against the skin on his neck.  Something is 
      happening here.  Nina is doing something to him.  

                                  NINA
                    Who WE are isn t important.  You don t 
                    care who we are.  What you wanna do is 
                    go downstairs and tell everyone to 
                    stay out of this room.  Then you ll 
                    forget we ever spoke. 
                          (beat)
                    Now, tell me what you're gonna do.

      We notice, now, that the detective's pupils are dilated, his 
      body relaxed, his whole demeanor having shifted from a moment 
      before.  

      His response is strangely muted, almost like he s talking to 
      himself.  


                                  POLICE DETECTIVE
                    I don t care who you are.  I m gonna 
                    tell everyone to stay out.  Gonna 
                    forget we spoke.  

                                  NINA
                    Okay, go.

      The detective heads for the door, but then... 

                                  NINA
                    Wait! 
                          (he stops)
                    Are you single?

      The detective holds up his hand, showing his wedding ring.  
      He tries to talk again, the words barely coming, but Nina 
      just cuts him off.

                                  NINA
                    Never mind.  Take off.

      And the detective leaves, just like that.  Nina shuts the 
      door after him.

                    You did it to him?

                    Dr. Rosen says we re not supposed to 
                    use our skills unless it s an 
                      emergency.

                                  NINA
                    You got ten minutes before that cop 
                    gets it together and comes back.  So 
                    hurry up.   

      Gary resumes his silent vigil, and now we realize that he is 
      staring at the VENT up near the ceiling.  There s a small 
      DENT in one of the louvers. He raises his hands in front of 
      his face and begins gesticulating.  It looks like the 
      stereotyped behavior seen in many autistics...

                                  NINA
                    What is it, Gary?  What cha got? 

      ...but in Gary s case, it has a very specific purpose.  

      We SUDDENLY SHIFT INTO GARY S POV --

      Gary s view of the world is like a hyper-detailed, all 
      knowing Google Maps with the 3D rendering software built in. 
      He uses his hands to explore and manipulate the OVERLAID 
      BLUEPRINT of the Courthouse, revealing that the VENT actually 
      extends away from the room and all the way across the 
      building.   

      BACK IN REALITY, something has clicked for Gary.  

                                  GARY
                    We need to go to the bank.  

      Off Nina's confused look...



      Rosen and Harken are walking through the office.  Harken is 
      examining a photo taken from a miliary ID card.  It shows a 
      guy in his late twenties, handsome, enigmatic, if not a 
      little troubled.  His name appears in bold letters...

                                  HARKEN
                    Christian Hicks.  This is him?

                                  ROSEN
                    It was his fingerprint.  
                          (to himself)
                    Where did I leave them?  

                                  HARKEN
                    You sure you want to go after this 
                    guy?  

                                  ROSEN
                    Very much so.  If I can ever find the 
                    keys to the truck.  


      Rosen glances around the room, then it hits him.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Who drove it last?



      Harken leafs through the file on Hicks as he follows Rosen 
      down the hall.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Have you read the jacket?  I mean 
                    we re not just dealing with some kid 
                    who can bend spoons or add a bunch of 
                    numbers in his head.  The guy was a 
                    sniper in the Marine Corps.... before 
                    he went AWOL.

      As they pass the conference room, Rosen pokes his head in.
































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              21.





      On the conference table are a number of high-tech 
        surveillance cameras and microphones.  Rachel is packing them 
      carefully into a case.

                                  ROSEN
                    Rachel dear, you wouldn t have 
                    happened to see the keys to the truck?

      Rachel shakes her head.  Mimics Gary s gesticulations.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Of course.



      Rosen and Harken head for the break room.

                                  HARKEN
                    The guy is dangerous, Doc.  More than 
                    these people can handle.

                                  ROSEN 
                    It s our job, Bill.  Identification 
                    and analysis of Alphas.  Like everyone 
                    else, we have to sing for our supper.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Well, can I talk to those people?  I d 
                    like to know who I m singing for.  

      Rosen stiffens a bit, this is something he doesn t want to 
      talk about. 

                                  ROSEN
                    We should talk about why you feel the 
                    need to ask me that when you know I 
                    can t answer, Bill.  It s important 
                    for you to come to grips with your 
                      anxieties.  

      And Rosen walks away, the discussion over.  



      Gary pumps some change into a vending machine with a MASSIVE 
      DENT in the side (someday we ll hear why Harken did it.) 
      Rosen enters.

                                  ROSEN
                          (firmly)
                    Keys, Gary.  

      Gary pulls a candy bar from the machine.

                                  GARY
                    I got a Kit Kat.

                                  ROSEN
                    Now...

      Rosen holds out his hand.

                                  GARY
                    I wanna drive.

                                  ROSEN
                    I know you do.  And I know you you ve 
                    committed to memory every last street 
                    in Manhattan and the outer boroughs.  
                    It s a terrific asset.  But you are 
                      absolutely not driving.  

                                  GARY
                    My Mom said I could.

                                  ROSEN
                    She most assuredly did not.  But I 
                    will call her and see if you can come 
                    along.  

      Gary reluctantly pulls out the keys.  Rosen takes them.



      Nina is behind her desk, her hands engaged in some busywork 
      we can t see.  Harken enters, steaming.   

                                  HARKEN 
                    I hate it when he pulls that.  

                                  NINA
                    Hate who what?     

                                  HARKEN
                    Rosen?  The turning your question back 
                    on you thing?  

                                  NINA
                    Ah yes.  Your question becomes THE

                                  NINA(cont'd)

                          (mimicking Rosen)
                     Why would you ask me that, Nina?  Did 
                    Daddy spank you when you were bad?   

      Nina lifts her hands up and aims the semi-automatic pistol 
      she has been loading. Harken is startled. 

                                  HARKEN
                    Jesus!  

                                  NINA
                    Chill out, Grandma.  I passed my level 
                    threes.  I m ready.

      Nina pushes past him, leaving Harken angry and frustrated.  
      He balls a fist to punch the wall... 

      Then pulls out his pill case and pops three yellows instead. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A STOCKBOY, wearing an apron, carefully stacks a new shipment 
      of oranges.  He places each of them just so, forming a 
      perfect, symmetrical pyramid.  

      The stockboy is the man we saw in the military ID, CHRISTIAN 
      HICKS, and he couldn t look more harmless.  He s clean cut 
      and handsome, relatively stable looking, and seems content 
      with the work-a-day banality of his job.  Still, it is 
      instantly clear that he does not belong here, he was meant 
      for more than this.  

      A MOTHER with three rambunctious kids approaches with her 
      grocery cart and accidentally bumps Hicks  perfect pyramid of 
      oranges. 

      One of the oranges rolls off of the top.  Before it hits the 
      floor...

      Hicks backhands it.    

      With a flick of his wrist, he tosses the orange back on the 
      pile.  He puts so much  English  on it that it spins back up 
      to the top of the pyramid, where it rotates for a moment then 
      comes to a gentle stop.  

      One of the children -- a wide-eyed five-year-old GIRL, looks 
      up at Hicks in amazement. 

                                  GIRL
                    Pull the trigger.




































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              24.



      Hicks stares back at her... what?

                                  GIRL
                    Do it again.  

      Hicks is confused.  Did he mishear her the first time? 

      Before he can ask her, the girl's mother pulls her away.  

      A little shaken, Hicks turns back to his produce section,   
      only now the sign that should read  Oranges .99 lb.  reads 
       Pull the trigger.   Hicks double takes...

      Something is not right here&

                                  MR. MARTINEZ (O.S.)
                    Hicks....

      Hicks looks up.  His manager, MR. MARTINEZ approaches.  He s 
        mid-fifties, friendly.

      Hicks glances back at the sign.  It's back to normal:  
       Oranges .99 lb. 


                                  MARTINEZ
                    What are you doing here?  

                                  HICKS
                    Just the... fruits and vegetables.  

                                  MARTINEZ
                    You had a shift yesterday.

                                  HICKS
                    Yeah.  So?  

                                  MARTINEZ
                    You missed it, Chris.  You never 
                    showed up.  

                                  HICKS
                    What are you talking about?  

      Martinez shakes his head, feels bad for the guy.  

                                  MARTINEZ
                    I don t know what s going on with you 
                    buddy, but we talked about this.  It s 
                    the third time.  I told you if it 
                    happened again, that s it. 

      Hicks is baffled.










































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              25.



                                  HICKS
                    I was here.  I know I was.

      He just stands there, racking his brain to remember, WHERE 
      WAS I?  But the memories clearly aren't there.  

                                  HARKEN  (O.S.)
                    This can t be right.



      It s a one-bedroom, sparsely furnished, not very cheerful.   
      If Hicks has a past, he clearly running away from it -- no 
      photos of family, friends or sweetheart.   No souvenirs. Just 
        a threadbare sofa from the Salvation Army, a crappy TV, and a 
      bookshelf with a few self-help paperbacks with titles 
      involving  recovery.         

      Rachel is standing on a chair in the center of the room, 
      having trouble reaching a light fixture.  She's trying to 
      plant a surveillance camera with a wireless transmitter, but 
      she's too short to reach.  

      The CELL PHONE in her pocket starts VIBRATING.  She reaches 
      for it, fumbles and drops it.  Standing with the fixture in 
      her hand, she ignores the phone and hurries to finish what 
      she s doing.



      Nina, frustrated, leaves Rachel a message.  

                                  NINA
                          (into phone)
                    Rachel, it s Nina.  He s coming.  Get 
                    out NOW.  

      She flips the phone closed.

                                  HARKEN
                    We re gonna have to take him down.

                                  GARY
                    Dr. Rosen said  observe, not engage.

                                  HARKEN
                    She s gonna get caught in there.

                                  NINA
                    We should call Rosen.  




      Rachel has the cell phone to her ear. She blanches as Nina s 
      frantic message plays.  



      Hicks walks up to his apartment door.  He s about to put the 
      key in the lock, when... He hears something.  Heavy 
      footsteps.  Not coming from inside the apartment, but from 
      the stairwell.  

      Hicks listens for a moment, then shrugs it off and puts his 
      key in the door.  



      Rachel restores the light fixture to its proper position, 
      then heads for the front door.  She s about to reach for it 
      when...

      The front door begins to open.  Rachel quietly backs up, then 
      turns and bolts for the BACK DOOR.    



      Hicks is about to enter his apartment when...

      BOOM!

      The staircase door slams open and BILL HARKEN stumbles out 
      into the hall.  But he looks different.  His pupils are 
      dilated, the veins on his neck strain against his skin, his 
      face reddens as a flood of adrenaline courses through his 
      body.  These are the actual physiological manifestations of 
      the  fight or flight  instinct.  

      He sees Hicks at the door to his apartment.  

                                  HARKEN
                    Hey!  

      Hicks, turns, shocked to see this crazed man rushing towards 
      him, pointing at him and yelling.  


                                  HARKEN 
                    DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW! 

      BY THE STAIRS, Nina arrives to see Harken about to tackle 
      Hicks.

                                  NINA
                    Bill!

      Harken ignores her, lunges at Hicks.

      And, in the face of attack, another side of Hicks suddenly 
      emerges.  The wounded look and the world weary slouch vanish, 
      his heightened agility kicks in.  

      As Harken reaches for him...

      Hicks counters with a jackrabbit-fast evasive maneuver.  Then 
      a sweep kick that knocks Harken off his feet.  

      Even more enraged, Harken scrambles back to his feet and 
      swings a fist at Hicks. 

      Hicks dodges it -- 

      And Harken s hand smashes RIGHT THROUGH THE WALL! 

      Hicks is momentarily stunned at the strength of Harken s 
      blow.  

      Nina reaches for Hicks but he nimbly evades her and goes out 
      through an open window.  

      The chase is on.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                           ACT THREE


      FADE IN:



      Gary is back in the driver s seat, his hands dancing in the 
      air.  

      WE GO BACK INTO GARY VISION -- 

      Gary uses his hands to manipulate the map of the neighborhood 
      floating in front of him.  He zooms in on a section, then, 
      with a flick of his wrist, spins the 3D image, revealing the 
      alley Hicks has chosen to run down.

      BACK TO SCENE, Gary talks into his cell on speakerphone.

                                  GARY
                    There s only two ways out of there.  
                    One s blocked by a fence.  




      Spoiled heaps of trash litter the pavement.  The shadows of 
      the tall buildings framing the alley cover it in darkness.

      HICKS drops down from a ledge above.  He heads out towards 
      the street but then sees the JOGGER moving into position at 
      the end of the alley. 

      So he heads off in the opposite direction.  

      He comes to a stop when he reaches a chain-link fence that 
      blocks the alleyway.  But it s not the fence that stops him.  

      It s Nina.

      She s on the other side, her gun trained on him.  

                                  NINA
                    Don t move!   

                                  HICKS
                    Why are you chasing me?

                                  NINA
                    Gee, why do you think?

                                  HICKS
                    I didn t do anything!

                                  NINA
                    Then why are you running?

      Hicks doesn t have a good answer for her.  She takes a step 
      closer, and now notices something. 


















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              33.



      It s the look in his eye; kind of glassy, confused.  It s a 
      look she s familiar with.  

      Nina aims her gun, drawing a bead on him.  

                                  NINA
                    I ll shoot you.   

                                  HICKS
                    You ll miss.  It s a harder shot than 
                    you think.  
                          (beat)
                    And you won t shoot me anyway.  

      Hicks suddenly takes off.  

      ON NINA -- finger on the trigger, but, damnit, he s right. 

      Hicks runs back out the way he came, then turns to give her 
      one last look when--

      BAM!

      Harken decks him with a cross-check that cracks a rib, 
      rattles his teeth and leaves him sucking air.  

      Hicks tries to get up and Harken grabs him with one hand and 
      tosses him like a rag doll.  He smashes into a dumpster, 
      tipping it and spilling garbage all over the street.  

      Hicks looks up, blood dripping from a gash on his head, to 
      see Harken lumbering towards him, hyperventilating, his face 
      beet-red, sweat pouring off his forehead.  

      Hicks grabs some debris off the ground... some peach pits, a 
      can of soda, anything he can get his hands on.  

      He scrambles to his feet and starts winging them at Harken as 
      he races for the mouth of the alley.

      Harken dodges most of the missiles, but one of the pits 
      catches him right in the throat.  A ROTTEN APPLE sails past 
      Harken, but then ricochets off the alley wall and hits Harken 
      in the back of his heel, kicking his foot up, pitching him 
      forward onto his face.  It's an amazing, precise, billiards 
      shot of a throw -- Minnesota Fats would be proud. 



      Hicks is lying in a make-shift  hospital bed .  He s 
        unconscious, heavily sedated.  His wrists are restrained by 
      heavy, leather bands, as are his ankles.     

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    There is an extreme sensitivity to 
                    stimuli. Emotional issues become 
                      magnified, self medicating ensues to 
                    dull the exquisitely tuned senses, and 
                    what was once perfection...... 

      Rosen stands in front of a monitor, displaying the image of 
      Hicks, restrained in bed.  The rest of the team looks on. 

                                  ROSEN
                    ... turns into disaster.  Which is how 
                    a boy with so much promise ends up 
                    like this.  

                                  HARKEN
                    A perfect game, huh?  



















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              37.



                                  ROSEN
                    And in his one week in the majors he 
                    walked fifteen straight batters.  It s 
                    a pattern he would repeat, 
                      accelerating through the ranks in the 
                    Army Rangers.  And then, suddenly, 
                    going AWOL. His own worst enemy. 

                                  RACHEL
                            (whispering)
                    Like the rest of us. 

                                  HARKEN
                    You don t see me killing people for 
                    money, sister.  

                                  NINA
                    I m not sure he did, either.

                                  HARKEN
                    Really?  Cause I am sure.  His prints 
                    are on the shell casing.  He DID it.  

                                  NINA
                    That s not what I meant.  When I spoke 
                    to him, in the street, he had this 
                    look in his eyes. I know that look.  
                    I ve seen it before, when I push 
                    someone.  

      Rosen is interested by this, he suddenly perks up.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Really?  Can you elaborate?

                                  HARKEN
                    Wait a second, don t tell me you re 
                    falling for this...  

                                  ROSEN
                      I wondered why someone with his 
                    training would leave behind a 
                      fingerprint...

                                  HARKEN
                    Oh please, she s creaming her jeans 
                    for the guy! 

                                  ROSEN
                    Bill, that s completely inappropriate.

                                  HARKEN
                    Y know what s inappropriate, is we got 
                    a guy who killed someone sitting here, 
                    instead of in jail.  Just cause she...

      Harken suddenly realizes:  Nina s not in the room with them 
      anymore.  

                                  HARKEN (CONT D)
                    Hey.  Where is she? 

      Rosen and Harken look up. Rachel points to the monitor.  Both 
      men are surprised by what they see...

      NINA IS ENTERING THE ROOM WITH HICKS.



      Hicks, awake now, struggles to pull himself to a sitting 
      position.  He winces at his pounding headache -- a by-product 
      of Rachel Meyer's unusual gift.

                                  NINA 
                    Like the worst hangover you ever had, 
                    right?  Rachel s done it to me a 
                    couple times, by accident.  I think.  
                    Here, take these...

      He looks up to see Nina, holding out some pills.  With his 
      wrists restrained, he can t do much.  


                                  NINA 
                    Open wide.  

      She sits on the bed, next to him, then puts the pills in his 
      mouth.  She puts a glass of water to his lips and he chugs it 
      down as fast as she can pour, his throat parched.  

                                  HICKS
                    Where am I?  

                                  NINA
                    We ll get to that.  First, I have some 
                      questions.  



      Everyone is watching the scene tensely through the monitor.  
      Harken looks like he s ready to bust into the next room.

        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              39.



      Nina sits very close to Hicks now.  She lifts her hands up 
      towards his face.  He flinches, pulls back instinctively.  We 
      see their lips move but can t hear what they are saying.

      Very gently, she places her hands on the base of his neck.  
      For a moment, it almost seems like she might pull him forward 
      to kiss him.   

      But she doesn t.  She whispers something in his ear, and 
      Hicks eyes go glassy...



      The line between professional and personal interest is blurry 
      for Nina, so it s hard to tell if she actually feels 
      something for the guy, or if it s all just a technique.  

                                  NINA
                    Where were you at 9:30 on Monday 
                    morning? 

                                  HICKS
                      I don t... know.  I don t remember.  

                                  NINA
                    Why don t you remember?   

                                  HICKS
                    I... have black outs.  I can t... I 
                    don t remember what happens.  

                                  NINA
                    Dig deeper, Christian, into your 
                      unconscious.  Why do you have 
                      blackouts?  When did they start?  

      Memories are flooding into his brain now, REPRESSED MEMORIES.  

                                  HICKS
                      Someone... did this to me.

      Even Hicks seems to be surprised by this revelation.  Nina 
      glances towards the one-way mirror with an  I told you so 
      look. 

                                  HARKEN (O.S.)
                    It doesn t prove anything.

      The team is discussing their options now.  Everyone in the 
      room looks at Rosen, who is busy with his monitors.  

                                  HARKEN
                    This is a mistake, Rosen.  We gotta 
                    turn this guy in.  

                                  NINA
                    Give it a rest Bill.  

                                  HARKEN
                    You got the hots for the guy, so...

                                  ROSEN
                    GO HOME.   

                                  NINA
                    You re the one whose judgement lives 
                    in his pants.  That s why...


                                  HARKEN
                    At least I know what...

                                  ROSEN
                    STOP IT!  Both of you! 

      They are shocked by this sudden outburst.  

                                  ROSEN
                    The phrase  get a room  comes to mind.  
                    Now GO HOME.  Everyone.  

      Sheepishly, they turn and walk out of the room.  Rosen taps 
      Rachel s arm.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Not you Rachel.  You stay. 

      Rosen turns back to the image of Hicks on the monitor. 

                                  ROSEN
                    We have work to do.  



      Rachel pulls a cart of electronics across the room, plugs it 
      in.  As it lights up...

































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              41.



                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    Take a look at this...

      Rachel joins Rosen by a monitor.  

                                  ROSEN
                    This is the beta wave of a normal 
                    subject.  

      Rosen gestures towards a series of measurements, marked Beta.

                                  ROSEN
                    Now a subject influenced by Nina s 
                       pushing.  

      Rosen quickly calls up another screen.  The inconsistent wave 
      has been smoothed out a bit.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Now Mr. Hicks... 

      He hits a few buttons, nothing happens.  He reaches down, 
      plugs in some wires that head into the next room, makes sure 
      they re secure and POP, another reading comes up...

                                  ROSEN
                    The beta wave is almost completely 
                      suppressed.   

      The brain wave is a flat line.  Rachel reacts.

                                  RACHEL
                    Have you ever seen this before?  

                                  ROSEN
                    Not to this extent.  It s similar to 
                    Nina, but much more powerful.  Hmm, 
                    we ll need to up the dose...

      He drums his fingers, counting, a nervous habit.  

                                  RACHEL
                    Don t we wait for the MRI results?  

                                  ROSEN
                    No, we just need to compensate for the 
                    strength of the suppression.  
                          (beat)
                    Prepare a dose of Topiramate for our 
                    guest.  We should have him 
                      straightened out in short order.    
























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              42.



      As Rachel moves towards the medicine cabinet...

                                                                            CUT TO:



      It s a working class joint -- Billy Joel on the jukebox, off-
      duty cops and Feds knocking back tall ones and shooting pool.   
      Quinn is at the bar, blowing off steam with some of the guys 
      from work.  

                                  HARKEN (O.S.)
                    Knew I d find you here.  

      Quinn spins to see Harken. 

                                  QUINN
                          (a little shitfaced)
                    Hey, Billy.  You almost missed me, 
                    bro.  I was just leaving. 

      Harken sidles up to the bar, the TWO AGENTS next to Quinn are 
      giving him the stink eye.  Harken nods a greeting, and the 
      drunker of the two, a red faced sparkplug name WHELAN grits 
      his teeth. 

                                  WHELAN
                    You got no right bein  here, you piece 
                    a trash.

                                  QUINN
                    Hey, come on now, boys.  Ancient 
                    history.  

      Whelan glances at Quinn, defers to his superior, though not 
      happy about it.  He picks up his drink and moves, followed by 
      the other agent.  Quinn looks over at Harken...

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    Jeez, Bill, sorry bout that...

                                  HARKEN
                    Forget it.  You get my message? 

      Quinn shakes his head, then points to his watch.

                                  QUINN
                    Gotta catch the PATH.  Wasn t 
                    checking.   


















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              43.



                                  HARKEN
                    If I had a lead on that Sanchez 
                    witness case, you think you could 
                    track something down? 

                                  QUINN
                    The Sanchez...?  Billy, we got that 
                    one in the bag already.  No worries 
                    there.  

      Harken is surprised to hear this.  

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    Ernesto Morez.  Wasn t that much of a 
                    stretch.  He s the go-to guy for the 
                    cartels.  One of our informants 
                    confirmed he got the contract on both 
                      witnesses.

      Quinn clumsily scrolls through his Blackberry, then holds it 
      up.  On screen, a grainy photo shows a man standing in a 
      doorway.  In his hand -- the conspicuous metal briefcase.   


                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    Slippery bastard, Everything s 
                      circumstantial on this guy.  Never 
                    leaves anything, no evidence.  That s 
                    his MO.  Nothing but a corpse. 

      Harken is startled, and a bit alarmed, by this news.  He 
      doesn t quite see how the pieces fit.  

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    Second witness comes in tomorrow.  
                      They re... you know these guys, 
                    they re puttin' out fake schedules,  
                    using body doubles. Hopin  ta flush 
                    this scumbag out.

      Quinn pulls on his beer, wipes his mouth.  Three sheets to 
      the wind. 

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    I gotta make the train, Billy.  Can 
                    you grab this one for me?   

      Before Harken can answer, Quinn is pushing through the crowd.  
      Harken watches him go.  

                                  HARKEN
                          (under his breath)
                    Ancient history, right.  











































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              44.



      Harken motions for the check.  The bartender starts counting 
      empties.  Harken frowns, stuck by that cheapskate again. 



      A groggy Quinn comes to in the back of a van, even more 
      confused by the alcohol and the chemical solvent mickey he 
      just got slipped.  He looks up to see...

      ERNESTO MOREZ, the man himself.  Next to him, that briefcase 
      is snapped open, and he is holding a long, thin, razor-sharp 
      needle that is attached by a tube to an apparatus in the 
      briefcase.  The whole setup looks like something from a 
      Cronenberg movie, it s just creepy as shit.  

      Quinn tries to mumble something, but finds he can barely 
      move.  He watches in mute, paralyzed horror as Morez bends 
      his head forward and SLIDES THE NEEDLE RIGHT INTO HIS BRAIN 
      STEM.  As he meets resistance, Morez presses harder.  This 
      isn t a smooth process.  It s messy and difficult, and 
      probably too intense for younger viewers.


      Quinn is in a daze, his eyes fluttering.

      With the needle inserted, Morez reaches into Quinn s jacket 
      and finds his Blackberry.  His fingers fly across it as he 
      reprograms the settings, and then...

      That annoying RING-TONE plays, the same one we heard at the 
      courthouse. Morez puts it up to Quinn s ear.  He speaks 
      quickly and clearly, not wasting a moment.  

                                  MOREZ
                    When you hear this tone, you wait for 
                      instructions.  You WAIT until I tell 
                    you.  You follow every word I say...
                          (beat)

        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              45.

                                    MOREZ(cont'd)

                    I want to know when Duc Minh is 
                      transferred to the courthouse.   
                      Itinerary, travel route, security 
                    detail.  If it changes, you call me.  

      Morez makes some adjustments on the equipment in his case.  
      He grabs Quinn s slumping face and focuses it. 

                                  MOREZ
                    LISTEN TO ME!  Anything that comes in 
                    about me, Morez, Ernesto Morez, you 
                    update me.  You call the number.  You 
                    will notify me every time my name 
                    comes up. You will not let them catch 
                    me.  

      Morez checks Quinn s pulse, then his pupils with a penlight.  
      Satisfied, he yanks the needle out of his neck, wipes the 
      blood with a rag and puts it back in the suitcase. 

                                  MOREZ
                    You hear the ringtone, you forget 
                      everything. In 5 minutes, you wake up.  

      Morez hits the ringtone again and now we JUMP CUT TO:



      Back in the offices of Section 8, all is quiet.  It's late at 
      night.  Hicks wakes up, slowly.  He is surprised to see the 
      straps removed from his arms and legs.  His head feels clear.  

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    Feeling better?

      He looks up to see Dr. Rosen, standing there.  

                                  ROSEN
                    We have a lot to talk about, Mr. 
                    Hicks. 



      Rosen hands Hicks his belongings, phone, wallet, keys -- as 
      he leads him through the office.  

                                  ROSEN
                    ... our official purpose is to locate 
                    alphas, and determine if they re 
                    assets or liabilities to national 
                    security.  In practice, however, we 
                    are tasked with training them, 
                    treating them, rehabilitating them if 
                    need be.  

                                  HICKS
                    Can you back up a second.  You keep 
                    saying  alpha ...

                                  ROSEN
                    An individual with enhanced abilities 
                    due to differences in their brain 
                      structure.  It s just a term...

                                  HICKS
                    Like the girl who gave me the 
                    headache?  You re saying she did that 
                    with her brain?






















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              47.



                                  ROSEN
                    Rachel, and, well...yes.  An anomaly 
                    in the structure of her left parietal 
                    lobe allows her to manipulate sound 
                    waves with her vocal chords.  




      Rachel Myers sits in her office, reading from a Hebrew prayer 
      book.  She nervously eyes a wine glass in front of her. 

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                    Before Rachel, the largest recorded 
                    vocal range for a human being was 12 
                    and a half octaves.  When I came 
                    across her, she just happened to be 
                    working at the CIA as an analyst. And 
                    her vocal range was over thirty five 
                    octaves, past the level of sonar or a 
                    dog whistle. 

      The wine glass begins to vibrate, and Rachel adjusts the 
      implant on her throat, manages to finish without breaking it.  

      Pleased at her success, she lets out a small SQUEAK.  The 
      glass shatters.  Shit.

      We reveal Rosen and Hicks, watching this from the hallway. 

                                  ROSEN 
                    The same wiring that allows her to 
                    control octaves kept her from forming 
                    speech.  Her strict, religious 
                      upbringing didn t help matters, as her 
                    parents refused to get her therapy.  
                    So we re trying to make up for lost 
                    time.   



      Rosen leads Hicks out of the main offices now, towards the 
      vending machines.  

                                  HICKS
                    What about the woman,  in the room... 
                    She did something to me.   












































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              49.



                                  ROSEN
                    Nina.  She  pushed  you.  

      Hicks looks at him.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    You ve seen hypnosis, I m sure?  Well, 
                    when Nina touches someone, she 
                    transfers a wavelength that resonates 
                    directly in the frontal lobe. It 
                    induces a small seizure, which lowers 
                      inhibition and makes the person 
                    extremely vulnerable to her 
                      suggestion. A chemical hypnosis.  We 
                    call it  pushing.   

                                  HICKS
                    So what s the downside there?  Seems 
                    like she can get whatever she wants.  

      Rosen smiles awkwardly, this is a whole can of worms.  

                                  ROSEN
                    Yes, well, that s true, but...



      Nina's apartment in a deluxe Manhattan hi-rise is 
      ostentatiously expensive, if a little bare.  Not what you'd 
      expect for someone with her pay-grade, but knowing Nina, it's 
      easy to imagine that she didn't pay for any of it. The eager 
      valet follows her inside.  Nina directs him to undress and 
      get in bed.

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    ...there is a price for always getting 
                    what you want. You can never trust 
                    that people's feelings for you are 
                    genuine. 



      Nina and the Valet are going at it in her bedroom.  Nina 
      whispers in the Valet s ear.

      It doesn t seem to have any effect.  So she puts her hands on 
      his head.  Now, more emphatically, we hear her say... 

                                  NINA
                    Tell me you love me. 

                                  VALET
                    I love you.  

      He says it like he means it, but it isn t real and Nina knows 
      it.  The pure carnality of the moment is undercut by the 
      profound sense of disgust she has with herself.  The pleasure 
      fades from her eyes.  

                                  ROSEN (V.O.)
                    Imagine the insecurity that would 
                    create.  



      Rosen and Hicks stop in a hallway across from the breakroom.    

                                  HICKS
                    I don t know, man, I m having a hard 
                    time with all this. I feel like I m 
                    being put on. 

                                  ROSEN
                    That s good, that means you re 
                      listening. Now, I want you to do 
                    something for me, Christian.  

      Rosen and reaches into his pocket, fishes out a handful of 
      quarters. He hands them to a confused Hicks, them motions to 
      THE VENDING MACHINE, which is visible across the hall, 
      through an open door.  About ten yards away.  


                                  ROSEN
                    I want you to get me a soda.

      Hicks, a bit baffled by this request, takes the quarters and 
      starts walking towards the machine.  Rosen grabs his arm. 

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    No, from here.  Throw them.

                                  HICKS
                    What?  That s... I can t do that. 

                                  ROSEN
                    Yes. You can.  































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              51.



      Hicks gives him a look like he s crazy.  Then he reaches back 
      and casually tosses the quarter at the machine. Miraculously, 
      it sails across the room and right into the coin slot.  

      Hicks looks at Rosen, amazed.  Rosen smiles.

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    See?  

      He motions for him to throw the next one.  

      Hicks flicks the next quarter, which also flies true.  The 
      third quarter misses, glancing off the slot, just a few 
      millimeters from the target.  

      Rosen reassures Hicks...

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Nobody's perfect.  

      Hicks then throws the final quarter, makes it in. 

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    But you're close.

      Rosen picks up the last quarter, drops it in.  The soda 
      tumbles out.  Rosen pops it open and takes a sip.  It s flat.  
      He puts it aside.  

                                  ROSEN
                    You are an Alpha, Christian.  One of 
                    the most talented ones I ve ever 
                      encountered.  Which is probably what 
                    made you a target.  

                                  HICKS
                    Me?  It doesn t make sense, I can t 
                    even hold a job down.   

                                  ROSEN
                    Someone wanted your skills, Mr. Hicks.  
                    And they weren t willing to take no 
                    for an answer.  

      The reality of this settles on Hicks.  In between all the 
      information he s spitting out, Rosen is starting to cut 
      through.  

                                  HICKS (CONT D)
                    I killed someone.  Didn t I?  


























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              52.



                                  ROSEN
                    I realize it s hard to accept.  But 
                    there s something you can do about it.  
                    We need to find the person who did 
                    this to you.  We need to find them and 
                    stop them from doing this again.  
                    That s why we need your help.   

      Rosen notices his pager ringing. He glances down at the 
      screen.  It s a message from Rachel,  URGENT. 

                                  ROSEN
                    Will you excuse me for a minute? 

      As Rosen leaves, Hicks  head drops.  The weight of everything 
      Rosen has told him is finally hitting home.    



      TIGHT ON A 3D rendering of a brain rotating on a monitor. 
      Rosen joins Rachel who s staring at the image.   

                                  RACHEL
                    Look.  Right here.  

      Rachel points to a spot on the screen.  It s a BB-SIZED 
      OBJECT that is LODGED INSIDE HICKS  BRAIN, like a tumor. 


      Rosen leans in for a closer look.

      The object is perfectly spherical, man-made looking.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                          (an understatement)
                    Oh.  That isn t good.  



      Hicks is left alone, contemplating his situation, the 
        implications that he s a killer. And then we hear something.  
      It is a familiar sound.  That same damned jingle, the 
      ringtone...

      Hicks picks up his cell phone. For some reason he can't 
      explain, he hesitates.

      Should he answer it?  Finally, he flips it open.  

                                  HICKS
                    Hello?

                          (over the phone)
                    Six am tomorrow.  Roof of the Bancroft 
                    building.  Do not be late.  SIX A.M.  
                    Time to kill, Mr. Hicks.

      Off Hicks...



      Rosen and Rachel are rushing towards the break room, when the 
      door suddenly swings open and Hicks steps out.  

                                  ROSEN
                      Christian?  Are you alright?  

      HICKS' POV:

      As Rosen speaks, we hear something different come from his 
      mouth.

                                  ROSEN
                    6 AM.  Bancroft Building.  Time to 
                    kill.

      Rosen tries to tell him again...

                                  ROSEN
                    6 AM.  Bancroft Building.  Time to 
                    kill.

      ROSEN knows something is wrong.  He puts his hand out to 
      touch Hicks  arm and...

      Without warning, Hicks grabs his hand and PUSHES HIM, right 
      into Rachel.  Knocking the two of them to the ground.  Then 
      he bolts for the exit.

      Rosen struggles to get up, his ankle twisted.  Rachel tries 
      to help him, but he waves her off.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    Follow him.  Don t lose him!  

      Rachel takes off after Hicks.

                             ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:



      Rosen is studying the 3D image of Hicks  brain, his eyes 
      focused on the BB-size object nestled in the parietal lobe.  
      Rosen zooms in on the object revealing circuitry beneath a 
      translucent shell.  Rosen speaks into a speaker phone. 

                                  ROSEN
                    I was wrong.  The beta waves were a 
                    side effect, the source of Mr. Hicks 
                    problem is a physical object, an 
                      artificial tumor.  Point nine 
                      millimeters in diameter.  Silica 
                    based.  It s pressing against the 
                    language center of his parietal lobe, 
                    which explains the hallucinations.  
                    But it also means verbal communication 
                    will likely be ineffective...    



      Seated in the rear, next to two ARMED GUARDS, is NON DUC 
      MINH, the second witness.   

      He stares out the window, knowing whatever happens today is 
      sure to change his life.  



      Nina and Harken are standing among several lawyer-types and a 
      bike messenger.  They watch the numbers light up as the 
      elevator rapidly ascends.

                                  ROSEN (O.S.)
                          (over cell)
                    Nina, your language based suggestion 
                    won t work without the proper 
                      trigger... 

                                  NINA
                          (into cell)
                    That s great, so...

      Other elevator-riders scowl at Nina.  She lowers her voice.

                                  NINA (CONT D)

                          (into cell)
                    How do I stop him?

                          (over cell)
                    You need to engage the pre-lingual 
                    portion of his brain, the limbic 
                    system.  You must go around the tumor 
                    and elicit a primal emotional 
                    response.

      Morez hits redial on his phone, then glances at the screen.  
      It says,  NO SERVICE.  

      Just as it seems that Morez has made it around the corner and 
      safely out of range...

      The bullet CLANGS off a street sign, an echo of his earlier 
      shot --


      And disappears around the corner.



      An hour later, Agent Quinn pushes through a crush of 
      bystanders, then flashes his badge to a patrol officer to be 
      let inside the CRIME SCENE. 

      As he moves past a group of cops towards the BODY lying in 
      the street, Quinn is met by another AGENT. 

                                  AGENT ONE
                    Got confirmation. It s Morez.  

      Quinn bends down to inspect, sees the bullet hole in the 
      head.  

                                  AGENT ONE
                    Kinda strange.  Same way as that 
                    witness in the courthouse.  Bullet out 
                    of nowhere.

      Quinn nods, not quite getting it.  The pieces don t fit.  























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































        SECTION 8         "Pilot"         3/01/08              62.



                                  AGENT ONE
                    You hear?  Sanchez took a plea. Once 
                    the other guy testified, they cut a 
                    deal to avoid the chair. Sometimes you 
                    get a happy ending, huh?  

      Quinn nods, then notices the cell phone in Morez s hand.  

      He slips on a plastic glove and delicately picks up the 
      phone.  The screen says,  LAST CALL DIALED.   Quinn considers 
      this, then hits  SEND.     

      We hear the familiar annoying RING TONE: it s coming from the 
      phone on Quinn s belt.

      A change comes over Quinn.  His eyes go glassy.  

      The other Agents leans over.

                                  AGENT ONE
                    And you said we d never catch him.  
                    Beer s on you tonight, Quinnie.

      Agent Quinn responds in a monotone.  

                                  QUINN
                    Beer s on me tonight. 

      Off Quinn s glazed look...



      A CLOSE UP of the strange device from Morez s briefcase.  A 
      combination of technology and parts that almost look organic.  
      It s unlike anything we ve ever seen before.  

      Examining the apparatus, Rosen is concerned.  Rachel looks 
      on. 

                                  ROSEN
                    I was alarmed by the prospect of an 
                    Alpha out there with a power even 
                    greater than Nina s.  But something 
                    about this...

      Referring to the device--

                                  ROSEN
                    ...this technology that mimics her 
                    ability, it actually frightens me 
                    more.

      Rachel nods, sympathetically, then whispers...  

                                  RACHEL
                    He s ready.  



      Hicks lies unconscious on the hospital bed. 


      Standing over him are Rosen and Rachel who both wear scrubs 
      and a surgical masks.  Rachel assists Rosen who works the 
      needle into the back of Hick s neck.  

      A filament leads from the needle to a side table where 
      Morez s device quietly hums inside the metal briefcase.      



      Nina stares at a stack of monitors showing different camera 
      angles on the examination room.  The operation is over.  
      Hicks sleeps on the hospital bed.  Rachel cleans up. 

      Rosen comes up behind her.  

                                  ROSEN (CONT D)
                    He's been through a lot, Nina.  It s 
                    not a pleasant experience knowing 
                    you ve been manipulated, forced to do 
                    things against your will.    

                                  NINA
                          (annoyed)
                    Why don t you just tell me what you 
                    mean?  

                                  ROSEN
                    The things that come to you deservedly 
                    are more satisfying, Nina.  You have 
                    to trust me on that. 

      Nina frowns, not liking the implication of Rosen s advice.  
      She walks out.   



      Hicks opens his eyes, groggily.  Rachel stands over him.  She 
      smiles and whispers.

                                  RACHEL
                    It s gone.

      Hicks smiles.  It s the first time we ve seen it.
