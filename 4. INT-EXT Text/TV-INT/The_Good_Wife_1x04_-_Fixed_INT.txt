      ALICIA.  She sits patiently.  Being questioned.  We re not 
      sure where yet.  A polite OFF-SCREEN QUESTIONER: 

                                  QUESTIONER (O.S.)
                    And this was on the sixteenth?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

      Some rustling of papers.   

                                  QUESTIONER (O.S.)
                    And who first told you about your 
                    husband s infidelity, Mrs. 
                    Florrick?

      Alicia pauses.  Unexpectedly personal.  She takes a second.   

                                  ALICIA
                    CNBC.

                                  QUESTIONER (O.S.)
                    I m sorry, I don t understand.     

                                  ALICIA
                    I was at the cleaners, waiting in 
                    line.  They had CNBC playing on a 
                    TV.  It was on the crawl at the 
                    bottom.   

    Ah, the questioner nods, and we meet... DANIEL GOLDEN (39).  
      A smiling lawyer.  Boyish face.  Polite to everyone, 
      especially his enemies.  In a tony law firm.  Overlooking the 
      city.  Two young ASSOCIATES on both sides of him, taking 
      notes.  

                                  GOLDEN
                    And, just so we re clear, you never 
                    once suspected your husband s 
                    infidelity before that moment, is 
                    that correct, Mrs. Florrick?

      Alicia pauses.  Looks up at Golden.  Realizes it s true:    

                                  ALICIA
                    That s correct.

                                  GOLDEN
                    I m sorry for asking all these 
                    personal questions.  But our appeal 
                    depends on proving that your 
                    husband made some untruthful 
                    statements at work notbecause he 
                    was trying to cover up illegal acts 
                    as a State s Attorney, but because 
                    he was trying to hide an affair 
                    from his wife.  You understand?  

      Alicia notices one of the Associates staring at her.  A young 
      woman.  Judging her?  Or just blankly uncaring?

                                  ALICIA
                      I understand.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Good.  Now turning to the call-
                    girl.  She made some statements in 
                    the press--  

      But-- bleet-bleet--Alicia s cellphone.  Alicia nods her 
      apology, steps away, answers...

                                  ALICIA
                    Alicia Florrick...  When?


      Alicia pushes out a door, starts toward the firm elevators, 
      Golden keeping up.  Jovial, as always. 

                                  GOLDEN
                    I ll phone your office to arrange 
                    another time, okay?

      Alicia nods, presses the down button, Golden waiting with her:

                                  GOLDEN (CONT D)
                    Thanks for doing this, Alicia.  I 
                    know it can t be easy: having me 
                    stick my nose in your business. 
                    How are the kids holding up?

                                  ALICIA
                    Good.

                    Good.  New school s okay?  Because 
                    I m on the board at Briarcrest, if 
                    you re interested, it s one phone 
                    call. 

                                  ALICIA
                    No thank you.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Just so you know, Alicia, Peter has

                    lawyers and business folks who 
                    don t like how all this came down.  
                    They want to help.  

      Alicia stares at him.  

                                  GOLDEN (CONT D)
                    I m just saying: if you need 
                    anything, day or night, give me a 
                    call.   

      Golden offers a card.  Alicia stares at it.

                                  ALICIA
                    We re fine.

      Okay, Golden nods.  Understands.  Takes the card back.  Ding.  
      Thank god.  The elevator.  She gets on, but Golden holds open 
    the doors.  

                                  GOLDEN 
                    Oh, and one more thing.  We re

                    Peter might have had with a Gerald

                    said all his private correspondences 
                    are at your apartment; so it would

                          (the doors start to blare)
                    If you could look for any letter or 
                    card from him!Okay, that s it.  
                    Dentist visit is over.

      Golden lets the doors close.  And...    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      4.




      ...Alicia stands alone in the elevator.  Silence.  Suddenly 
      tired, she leans against the wall.  Stares straight ahead.  


                                  CARY
                    Alicia.

      Alicia, starting into the courthouse, turns, sees CARY with 
    two legal boxes in a crowded courthouse hallway.  

                                  CARY (CONT'D)
                    I heard you were coming on board to 
                    replace Bree; that s great!  Could 
                    you...

    Oh.  One of the boxes.  Yes, Alicia lifts it.  Heavy.  Cary 
      with the other, leading the way...

                                  CARY(CONT'D)
                    Talk about complicated.  Jury 
                    selection took a week.  We ve got 
                    five more of thesefilled with 
                    medical testimony.  And the depo 
                    dump-- did you read it?

                                  ALICIA
                          (shakes her head)
                    I was on Will s felony case till 
                    about 30 minutes ago.

                                  CARY
                    Yeah, I was on a slip-and-fall when 
                    Diane yanked me onto this.  It s 
                    just all hands on deck, you know.  
                    But this one s pretty cool.  Come 
                    on, I ll get you up to speed.    

    And Cary pushes into court.  Alicia takes a breath, follows.  


      Court in session.  DIANE at the front, questioning:  

                                  DIANE
                    And what is an Ironman, Ray? 

    RAY DEMORY (27), handsome, muscular, casual.  Could be a 
      surfer kid or an aging skateboarder.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      5.
      CONTINUED:55


                                  RAY DEMORY
                    Running, biking, ocean swimming. 
                    You swim 2.4 Miles; bike 112 miles; 
                    then run a full marathon.  

      Alicia follows Cary up the aisle.  Court uncharacteristically 
      crowded.  Jury trial.  More lawyers than usual.  Alicia 
      notices KALINDA sitting in the gallery, nods to her, then 
      follows Cary through the gallery gate toward a bench behind 
    the plaintiff s table, four B-team Associates sitting there.

                                  DIANE
                    And you placed third in the 
                    Hawaiian Ironman, is that correct?

                                  RAY DEMORY
                    Yes, I did, yeah.

      Uh-oh, there s no room for Alicia on the short bench.  She s 
      left standing until a BAILIFF takes pity on her, sticks a 
      folding chair next to the bench.  Alicia nods her thanks... 
      sits.  Klunk.  It s lower than the bench.  She looks like a 
    kid at the adults table. 

                                  DIANE
                    So tell me what happened on the 
                    12th, Ray?

                                  RAY DEMORY
                    Well, it was right after the 
                    Ironman.  We were back in the hotel 
                    when I felt a migraine coming on. 
                    So I took these pills my doctor 
                      prescribed...

      Cary leans toward Alicia, whispers:

                                  CARY
                    Ray Demory.  He s our test case.  
                    If Diane wins this one, there s a 
                    massive class action in the wings.  

      Alicia nods, but tries to keep focused on the testimony.

                                  RAY DEMORY
                    The next day, at the hospital, I 
                    found out I had a stroke.

                                  DIANE
                    And these pills you took-- they 
                    were Zennapril, correct?

      Diane just smiles, shakes her head-- a lot of history between

    He points toward his chair.  And we see for the first time 
      it s a wheelchair-- blocked by the witness stand.

                                  RAY DEMORY (CONT'D)
                    Mostly it s been hard on Carol. 

    He nods toward his wife in the front row.  CAROL (25).  Pink-
      cheeked, Midwestern, straight out of a Whistler painting.  
    Had to grow up fast-- it makes her more human, likable.

                    We married a year ago, before my

                    invalid.

    But he stops, can t continue, looking at Carol.  Alicia looks 
      between them.  Moved.  Carol wiping her eyes, tearing up.

                    the battle and lose the war.  

      Alicia takes notes, but glances up and sees Carol down the 
      hall pushing her husband s wheelchair up to the restroom.

                    Use Kalinda whenever you need.  
                    Okay.  Let s get to it. 

    The Associates start off, passing Carol and Ray.  Only Alicia 
      pauses, watches Ray wheel the rest of the way into the 
      restroom as Carol waits outside, slumping, exhausted.  No 
      longer having to put on a strong front for him.

                                  ALICIA
                    Mrs. Demory.  Hi.  Can I get you 
                    anything?

                                  CAROL
                          (looks up, smiles)
                    No, I m fine.  Sorry, I must ve had 
                    a zombie look on my face.  

                                  ALICIA
                    No, no.  We all need a moment.  I m 
                    Alicia.     

                                  CAROL
                    Right, you replaced Bree.  Nice to 
                    meet you.

      They shake hands.  No recognition on Carol s face of Alicia s 
      background.  Alicia nods, liking the anonymity for once.  
      Alicia notices a shoebox in Carol s lap.  Seeing the look:

                                    CAROL(CONT'D)
                    This is what keeps us going.  

      Carol opens the top.  It s filled with opened letters, 
      photos.  Carol raises one.  A boy on a ventilator.

                                    CAROL(CONT'D)
                    Michael Graff.  He took Zennapril 
                    after a Little League game.
                          (more photos: young

                    Jenny Hollis.  She was a dancer.  
                    Tod Roller.  His wife left him 
                    after the stroke.  

                                  ALICIA
                    They all wrote you?

                                  CAROL
                    Yes.  138 of them.  I...

                    They re counting on us, you know?  
                    The lawyers felt Ray was the best 
                    spokesman, so if we don t win, 
                    they re... stuck.  It s just a lot 
                    of responsibility. 

      Alicia nods, knows.  They hear Ray calling  Carol  from 
      inside the restroom.  Carol smiles apologetically, stands:

                                  CAROL (CONT'D)
                    If you ll excuse me.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Can I help?

                                  CAROL
                    No.   For better or for worse... in 
                    sickness and in health,  you know.  
                    I never really thought about those 
                    words before. 

    And she enters the restroom.  Alicia watches the door swing 
      closed.  


                                  MCCLOON
                    Comfortable, sir?

    Ray back on the stand.  McCloon now questioning...

                                  RAY DEMORY
                    As much as I can be.

      Alicia is back on her folding chair, watching a bit more 
      intensely, a bit more involved, shooting occasional looks 
      toward a concerned Carol.  

                                  MCCLOON
                    Were you aware, Mr. Demory, that 
                    15% of migraine sufferers under 40 
                    experience at least one stroke--

      Judge Sutman sighs: a long day.

                    It would be nice if everyone 
                    started addressingthe bench, and 
                    not just debating each other

                                  MCCLOON
                    Of course, your honor, you make a 
                    good point.  I ll withdraw the 
                    question.  Mr. Demory, you said 
                    your doctor prescribed Zennapril 
                    for your migraines?  

                                  RAY DEMORY
                    Yes. 

                                  MCCLOON
                    I see.  Then you must be suing him

                    Objection.  Relevance.

                                  MCCLOON
                    Isn t it the case, Mr. Demory, the 
                    only reason you re not suing your 
                    doctor is because his pockets 
                    aren t as deep as my client s?

                          (yet again)
                    Approach the bench.

      Diane quickly whispers to her back-up bench before starting 
    up:

                                  DIANE
                    Get me all references to secondary 
                      prescriptions in Ray s deposition.

      And-- bang-- the Associates are off, rushing through their 
      depo books, searching.  Alicia too, eyeing her fellow hungry 
      Associates-- all a decade younger.  She lifts a stack of 
      depositions from the floor when...

        ...thlop--something falls from underneath one, flutters to 
    the floor.  A torn piece of paper, the size of a hand.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      11.
      CONTINUED: (2)77

      Alicia reaches down, picks it up.  Blank.  She flips it over, 
      sees... 

      ...a diagram scribbled on the other side.  Twelve circles in 
    two rows.  She looks up at the jury box.  Twelve chairs in 
    two rows.  A diagram of the jury.  She looks down at the 
      scrap again.  One circle is marked with an X.  And along the 
      side is scribbled the amount... 

      ...$35,000.  

      Alicia looks up.  Uh-oh.  Is someone bribing a juror?!  

    She studies the diagram again, the X marking the chair of 
      Juror #2.  Alicia leans slightly to peer at Juror #2 s seat 
    in the back row.  A calm, tall woman with a stylish haircut.  

    But Alicia pauses, realizes something.  It s unclear from the 
    way it s drawn which is the front and back of the jury box.   
    She looks at it from the other side-- the X now marks Juror 
      #11 s seat.  She looks up at...

      ...Juror #11: a young and professorial African-American male.    


    The dining room.  It s busy, crowded, loud.  Kalinda and 
      Alicia study it.  More a bohemian crowd.  Artists, models.  
    No one in suits.  Kalinda notices paper placemats on all the 
      tables.  She grabs one.  Shows it to Alicia.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Yep.  

      It s the same as the torn scrap.  Clearly someone drew the 
      diagram on a placemat over lunch, tore it to take it away...

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    So we should talk to the hostess, 
                    see if anybody from the court 
                    regularly eats here-- 

                                  KALINDA
                    No, we should take a deep breath, 
                    show this to Diane, and keep--

    But Alicia grabs Kalinda s arm: shh!  She hears a booming 
      man s voice.  A familiar voice.  The other room.  They turn, 
      start in that direction.  The voice getting louder, louder. 
      They turn the corner, find the voice s owner...

      ...McCloon.  

    In a private room, with his legal team of five.  Alicia and 
      Kalinda stare in at them.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      13.

                    the hostess.

    One of the legal team, a redheaded 27-year-old named JILLIAN, 
      looks up, sees them.  Goes to the door.  Slams it in their 
      face as Alicia and Kalinda trade a look.

    The scrap.  With its now familiar diagram.  Diane and WILL 
      lean over it as Alicia downplays it:

                                  ALICIA
                    It could mean anything.  It could 
                    just be a doodle.  We don t know.

                    You found it in ourdepositions?

                    Yes.  But there s a chance it was 
                    on the floor and just stuck to one, 
                    we don t know.  We just thought it 
                    should be brought to your 
                    attention.

                    It s still up for review.

      Alicia looks between them.  Clearly something the partners 
      only need to discuss.  She watches as they mind-meld:

                                  DIANE
                    So you think we... what?

                    Don t go to the judge.  It makes no 
                    sense.  How does it get in our 
                    depos?  

                                  DIANE
                    McCloon sticks it in there.  He 
                    wants a mistrial, but wants us to 
                    go to the judge to request it?

                    A redhead.  She came over and 
                    introduced herself this morning.

                    cases needing an unanimous verdict.

                    And once they deliberate, it s too 
                    late to change jurors.

                    Right, so let s find out if one is 
                    bad now.  Put in for an alternate.

                          (nods)
                    I ll put Kalinda and Cary on it.

      Alicia frowns - speak up, now or never -- then quickly:

                                  ALICIA
                    Excuse me.  I d like to do this.

      Diane and Will look up at her.  Will stays silent, looks to 
      Diane.  It s up to you.  She shrugs:

                                  DIANE
                    Okay.  

      Alicia nods: good.  And...


      VIRGINIA SUN (50).  A jury consultant.  Professional, slick, 
    an aging model with a soothing voice:

                                  VIRGINIA
                    Juror #2 is Marilyn Wolk, a 
                      hairdresser from South Bridgeport.  
                    We scored her an 85 positive on our 
                    bias scale, one of the highest 
                    scores we ve ever given, so we 
                    believe she is firmly in your camp.

      Kalinda rolls her eyes, not believing this crap, sitting with 
      Alicia in the large conference room.  Placards along the 
      wall: one for each juror.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      17.

                                  VIRGINIA (CONT D)
                    Now I know you pay me only to help 
                      selectjurors, but if I knew what 
                    you were after, I could offer 
                    further consultation. 

                                  KALINDA
                    No, this is good.  Keep going.

      Virginia looks toward Kalinda.  Clear animosity.  Okay.  She 
      points toward another placard:

                                  VIRGINIA
                    Juror #11 is Calvin Tober.  He s a 
                    grad student in comparative 
                    history.  We scored him only a 62% 
                    positive on the bias scale: well 
                    within the range of acceptability.  
                    But we like him.  Being African-
                    American, he is more prone to 
                    mistrust authority.  He is 
                    intelligent, but not to the point 
                    of overcoming bias--

                                  KALINDA
                    Not like Asians or Mexicans?

      Virginia frowns slightly:

                                  VIRGINIA
                    We only talk in racial stereotyping 
                    because you pay us to, and we find 
                    racial profiling works.  But if I m 
                    not needed, I ll--

                                  KALINDA
                    You re not needed.

      Virginia stares at her.  Alicia softens it.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you.

      Virginia nods, leaves, as Alicia raises an eyebrow at 
      Kalinda:

                                  KALINDA
                    Paying her $100,000 for three 
                    months of high school-level 
                      psychology?  Yeah, I guess I do 
                    have issues.

      Alicia smiles.  Yep, she likes Kalinda.  

                                  ALICIA
                    So what are you thinking?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Wolk works as a rent-a-chair hair 
                    stylist, right?  She only gets paid 
                    when she actually has a customer.  
                    She could ve claimed financial 
                    hardship and ducked jury duty.  So 
                    why didn t she?

                                  ALICIA
                    Civic duty?

      Kalinda stares at her: you re kidding.

                                  KALINDA
                    Jury tampering pays better.

      Alicia stare at Juror #2 s photo.  MARILYN WOLK.

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay.  But let s check into both.  

      Kalinda nods, and they split up.  


                                  DIANE
                    Objection, your honor. Is this 
                    really necessary? 

      Back in court.  Carol on the stand.  Nervous, tense.  McCloon 
      cross-examining...

                                  MCCLOON
                    The Demorys are seeking damages for 
                     loss of consortium,  your honor.  
                    The jury needs to understand that 
                    loss.

      Alicia sits down into her usual folding chair, returning to 
      court, Cary next to her, whispering...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      19.

                    What s going on?

                                  ALICIA
                    What?  

                                  CARY
                    I heard you re on some hush-hush 
                    project.  What is it?

                                  ALICIA
                          (smiles)
                      ...Hush-hush.

      Cary grins at her.  Okay.  They look back up at Diane and 
      McCloon arguing again:

                                  DIANE
                    Sir, the term  consortium  is not 
                    limited to--

                                  MCCLOON
                    I know what the term  consortium --

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                      Counselors, please.  I have prided 
                    myself on not using my gavel once 
                    in my thirty years on the bench, 
                    but you are truly making me 
                      reconsider.  Now, Miss Lockhart, I 
                    just-- overruled.

      McCloon smiles toward Diane, whispers an aside:

                                  MCCLOON
                      ...ka-ching...
                          (to the witness)
                    Mrs. Demory, before your husband s 
                    stroke, how often did you have 
                    sexual relations?

      Carol stares at him, truly embarrassed.  

                                  CAROL
                    I don t know, I guess, twice a 
                    week.

      Alicia, meanwhile, looks toward the jury.  Concentrating on 
      Juror #2.  Marilyn Wolk.  Paying intent attention.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      20.
      CONTINUED: (2)1313


                                  MCCLOON
                    And sincethe stroke, how often do 
                    you have sex?

                                  CAROL
                    I... I don t know.

      Alicia pans toward juror #11 now.  CALVIN TOBER.  Odd.  All 
    the other jurors are paying intent attention to the sex talk 
      except him, staring down at his pad.  Alicia studies him. 

                                  MCCLOON
                    Would you say it was less?

                                  CAROL
                    Yes, less.

                                  MCCLOON
                    But your husband isn t completely 
                    paralyzed from the waist down, is 
                    he?

                                  CAROL
                          (staring at him, pissed)
                    No.

                                  MCCLOON
                    So there areways...?

      Carol stares at him, red-faced, as...

      ...Alicia feels eyes on her.  She turns, looks toward the B-
      team behind McCloon s defense table, finding... the redhead, 
      Jillian, staring at her.  Jillian quickly looks away, and...

      ...Alicia considers it.  Studies her.  Was that the look of a 
      whistle-blower?  Meanwhile...


      ...Kalinda holds a small, brown paper-wrapped box, now in 
      front of an apartment door near the other juror: #11. 

                                  KALINDA
                    I hate to trouble you, but I m in 
                    the next building over and the 
                    delivery man left this at my door 
                    by mistake. Is there a Mr. Tober in 
                    this building? 

      It s a Kalinda-investigating-montage.  We get to see a bit of 
    how Kalinda works as we bounce back to...


      Inside juror #11 s apartment building:

                                  KALINDA
                    I can always come back later; if 
                    you know about when he gets home, 
                    or anyone else in his family?


                                  SENIOR CITIZEN
                    No, comes and goes mostly.  Kind of 
                    private. 

    And back to Juror #11 s apartment building, a SENIOR CITIZEN 
      with a walker, nods toward an apartment across the hall:

                                  SENIOR CITIZEN(CONT'D)
                    I think he s a student.  Tober, I 
                    think his name is. You could ask 
                    the super, Ozzie. Me, I usually 
                    don t like black people but he 
                    seems nice.  Where you from, dear?

                                  KALINDA
                    Chicago.

                                  SENIOR CITIZEN
                    No, originally.  Are you Saudi or 
                    something?

      Kalinda stares at her, tries to keep smiling...

                                  KALINDA
                    No.


      ...an upset Carol sits in the courtroom hallway, Alicia 
      comforting her.    

                                  CAROL
                    No, I m alright.  I m just angry at 
                    myself for letting him get to me.

                                  ALICIA
                    It s hard when people treat your 
                    private life like a crime scene.

      Carol nods, looks up at Alicia: 

                                  CAROL
                    Yeah, but I guess there are greater 
                    tragedies... 

    She nods toward two parents down the hall.  Their kid in a 
      wheelchair.  The Gerbers.  One of the Zennapril families.  

                                  CAROL (CONT D)
                    He takes a pill one night.  And the 
                    next morning he s like that.  

      Alicia nods-- it puts it in perspective.  She watches as 
      Carol starts toward them.  Hugs the parents.  Kisses the boy 
    on the cheek.  Bleet-bleet.  Alicia s cell.  Answering...  

                                  ALICIA

                                  GOLDEN
                    I m just wondering if you got a 
                    chance to look for those Kozko 
                    letters?  We re struggling with 
                    these weekend meetings Peter had 
                    with him last March.  The 9th, the 
                    16th, the 25th.

                                  ALICIA
                    I haven t looked yet.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Anything that will show Peter

                    knowing there was something... 
                     untoward  would help us. 

    But Alicia just watches the Gerbers.  That s what a family 
      really in crisis looks like.  

                                  GOLDEN (CONT D)
                    Oh, and Alicia, I was chatting with 
                    the headmaster at Briarcrest on 
                    another matter, and he mentioned 
                    they have some scholarships that 
                    might be appropriate for Zach and 
                    Grace if you--

                    Don t.  Please.

      Golden pauses a second.  

                                  GOLDEN
                    Yes, I m sorry.

    And Alicia hangs up.      THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      25.




      ...she crosses the lobby toward the elevators-- stops-- 
      sees... a moustached Derek Wolk buttoning a SECURITY GUARD 
      jacket, replacing a guard behind reception.  

    Oh.  Kalinda nods.  I guess he got a job.  

      Derek gets up, starts in her direction.  Kalinda turns away, 
      pretends to be checking the wall-sized BUILDING DIRECTORY.  
      Waits for him to pass.  Good.  He s gone.  She starts to turn 
      away when she notices something on...

      ...the directory.  The name of a law firm.  On the 70th 
      floor.  Harden, McCloon & Freebeck.  She zeroes in on the 
      middle name...  McCloon.  


                                  ALICIA
                    That s pretty tenuous, isn t it?  
                    Her husband works at McCloon s 
                    firm?   

      Alicia on her cell at home.  Searching through files of 
      letters in the overpacked maid s quarters.  Packing boxes, 
      furniture, odds and ends from their mansion.  Talking with...


      ...Kalinda in a corner of the lobby, eyeing Derek...

                                  KALINDA
                    Look, I m not saying it s a smoking 
                    gun.  I m just saying she didn t 
                    put it down on her voir dire, so if 
                    we wanna  get rid of her, we can.   


      Alicia nods...  

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay.  Let s take it to Diane, see 
                    what she says.  Thanks.  Bye.

      Alicia hangs up.  Pauses.  Looks at the piles of stuff.  
      Filing cabinets, ceiling-high packing boxes, files.  She 
      slumps.  Too much to search.  She sees a ROLLTOP DESK.  
      Peter s desk.  Considers it.  And...

      ...in JUMP CUTS...

      ...she tries to open it-- the top locked-- she tries the 
      drawers-- locked too--  wait, one opens halfway-- something 
      blocking it-- she reaches in, curls her fingers up-- 
      dislodges the blockage-- pulls it out: a small videotape.  
      Unmarked.  No label.  No writing.  She starts to put it 
      aside.  But...

      ...she looks back toward it.  Tempting to watch.  Whatever it 
    is.  She looks toward the door, hears...

      ...GRACE and ZACH arguing over the remote control in the 
      other room.  She carefully closes the door-- finds the video 
      camera in a packing box-- pops the tape in-- flips open the 
      view screen-- hesitates, her finger over  play.   What is she 
      going to find?  She clicks it, and...

      ...it starts in black.  Rustling.  Bed covers.  A whisper:

                                  PETER (O.S.)
                    ...is she gone?...

    Oh hell, this isn t going to be good.  Alicia leans against a 
      wall, bracing herself, hearing a shhhfrom someone off 
      camera.  

                                    PETER(CONT'D)
                    Check the driveway.  Is she gone?

      Peter whispering, coming into focus out of the darkness.  In 
      bed.  The camera moves toward the window.  A female giggle, 
    as the camera peers out, sees Alicia starting toward her car.  

                                  GRACE
                    She s gone!  Dad!

    Oh, it s Grace.  Zach runs in too.  The three talking over 
      each other, laughing, and...

      ...Alicia exhales.  Smiles.  Not what she expected.  She 
      frowns at her paranoia, watches... home movie jump cuts.  
      Peter in the kitchen.  With an apron.

                                  PETER
                    How do I look?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      27.

    The kids laugh.  Peter puts on a chef s hat, crosses his arms 
    in fey French fashion.  Alicia can t help but smile, watching 
      him.  More home video jump cuts...

    The oven.  A cake cooking, bubbling.

                                    PETER(CONT'D)
                    I don t think it s supposed to look 
                    like that.  Get me the--

      A jump cut: Peter in the front hall now, ripping up roses, 
      pricked by the thorns...

                                  GRACE
                    You were s posedto get rose petals 
                    already petaled, Dad, not roses.   

      Grace laughing, hugging a charmingly inept Peter.  She really 
      loves her dad, the two spreading rose petals from the front 
      door to the kitchen.  Another jump cut to: 

      ...a present.  A beautiful bracelet.  Tastefully luxurious.   

                                  ZACH (O.S.)
                    Wow.  That looks expensive.

                                  PETER
                    Yep, that s your third year of 
                    college.

      Laughter.  Alicia watches it all, smiling and... moved.  It s 
      a lost time really.  As distant as the Incas.  The film 
      finally cuts to... 

                                  ZACH
                    Here she comes; here she comes!  
                    Light the candles!

      A cake.  Not so beautiful.  Lopsided.  The words  Happy  Just 
      Because  Day.   And...

      ...Alicia smiles, eyeing the video when she pauses, looks in 
    the top corner of the frame... the digital timecode date.  
      3/16/09.  Alicia looks up.


      Alicia on her cell carrying the video, rushing:

                    It s the date you were talking 
                    about-- the 16th-- one of the days 
                    he was supposedly with Kozko.  He 
                      couldn t ve been; he was with us-- 
                    the whole day.  
                          (excitement on the phone)
                    Okay.  I ll bring it to your 
                    office.  Thirty minutes.   

      Alicia turns into...


      ...the kitchen, finds JACKIE preparing a large ham.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I m heading out.  

                                  JACKIE
                    But I m making dinner.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Wow, that s big.

    But Alicia notices a very large gift basket, recently opened, 
      surrounded by plastic wrap, some fruit.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT'D)
                    Where d this come from?    

                                  JACKIE
                    It was on the doorstep.  I think 
                    it s from your work.

      Work?  Alicia looks closer.  Finds several gifts still in the 
      basket: CDs, a Nintendo DS in its original packaging, beside 
    it, two iPod Touches opened.  What the--?

      Alicia finds the attached gift card.  Opens it.  Reads: 
       Please think of us as family. Daniel Golden.   

                                  JACKIE (CONT D)
                    Very nice of your firm, isn t it?  

      Alicia opens a drawer.  Takes out a large plastic garbage 
      bag.  Shakes it open.  Jackie pauses, sees Alicia take the 
      remnants of the basket and shove it in: Nintendo, CDs, iPods--  
    She moves toward the fruit in the bowl, pours it into the bag 
      too.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      29.

                    Um, dear?

    But Alicia is intent, moving on to the ham now.  She lifts it 
    out of the pan, shoves it into the garbage bag too.

                                  JACKIE (CONT'D)
                    Alicia!  What are you doing?! 

                                  ALICIA
                    What else was in the basket?

                                  JACKIE
                    I don t know.  Some bananas  This 
                    is very wasteful, Alicia.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Anything else?

                                  JACKIE
                    I don t know, cookies.


      Grace and Zach are flopped on the couch, eating bananas, 
      cookies, when Alicia passes through with her garbage bag.  
    She takes the half-eaten bananas and cookies, drops them in 
    the bag too.  Continues on.  Grace and Zach trade a look: 
      what the hell?


      After hours. Darkened offices. Receptionist long gone. 
      Elevator doors part and Alicia is met by Golden himself. 

                                  GOLDEN
                    Oh, good, I m so glad.  Do you have 
                    the tape?

      Alicia smiles.  A little heightened, intense.

                                  ALICIA
                    Why yes.  Something else too.  A 
                    gift.

      Golden stares at the white garbage bag Alicia thrusts out.

                                  GOLDEN
                    What is it?

      Klump--she drops the garbage bag at his feet.  Then, on top, 
    she drops the small video tape.  Golden stares at her, 
      impressed despite himself.  A force to be fuckin  reckoned 
      with.

      Alicia and Kalinda stand in front of Will and Diane finishing 
    up.  A polished conclusion:

                                  ALICIA
                    We re still working on the other juror-
                      - juror#11.  And we re not saying  
                    juror #2 was definitely bought off.  
                    We just think, based on appearances 
                    and the fact that it only takes one 
                    bad juror to toss out a favorable 
                    verdict, we should use this as pretext 
                    to bump Juror #2 and put in the 
                    alternate. 

      That s it.  Will and Diane sit back.  Pause.   Think.

                                  WILL
                    They make a good point.  Better 
                    safe than sorry.

                    What does the jury consultant say 
                    about the alternate?

      Kalinda rolls her eyes.

                                  ALICIA
                    The alternate is a Republican.  Not 
                    as good for us as the current 
                    juror.  

      Diane and Will sit back: that makes it harder.

                                  DIANE
                    So what if Juror #2 wasn t bought 
                    off?  I just replaced a good juror 
                    with a bad alternate. 

                                  WILL
                    So smoke out McCloon.  Bring the

                    bring it up.  And if McCloon goes 
                    crazy, you know she was bought, and 
                    fight for her expulsion.

                    you want Juror #2 off the jury or not?

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                    Okay, fine.  Juror #2 is out, and 
                    we ll put in the alternate.

      Diane stares at the judge.  It all moved too fast.  Diane 
      turns away, sees McCloon grinning.  Fuck.  


      Kalinda watches Alicia try to keep up with a pissed Diane 
      charging down the courthouse hallway.  Some talking to.  
      Alicia nods, slows, crosses toward Kalinda.

                                  ALICIA
                    We got played.

                                  KALINDA
                    What happened?  

                                  ALICIA
                    It was a McCloon set-up.  Jillian, 
                    wasn t a whistle-blower.  She put 
                    that placemat in our depos to play 
                    with us: to get us to dump our best 
                    juror.

                                  KALINDA
                    We don t know that.  

                                  ALICIA
                    McCloon didn t fight it!  He 
                    welcomed it.  He wanted #2 off.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Right.  Because we were wrong.  It 
                    wasn t #2.  It was #11.

      Alicia sighs, pauses, looks at her.

                                  ALICIA
                    Or... it s no one.

                                  KALINDA
                    Okay, maybe.  But we find out.    

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.   We thought number 
                    #2 looked guilty because she wanted 
                    to serve on a jury.  She was being 
                    a good person, and we thought that 
                    made her look guilty.

                                  KALINDA
                    So?

                                  ALICIA
                    If that X were on juror #5 or 8 or 
                    anyone, we would pry into their 
                    lives and find something that looks 
                    guilty because people from the 
                    outside look guilty.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes, and sometimes people from the 
                    outside look guilty because they re 
                    guilty.  I mean, what s your point: 
                    we don t look?  

      Alicia stares at her.  A long second.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.  I don t like... prying.

                                  KALINDA
                    Then don t.  Let me.

      Alicia stares at her.  Nods.  


      Juror #11.  No longer the hairdresser.  Now the alternate: a 
      stern Republican.  Arms crossed.  He s watched by... Alicia 
      still on her folding chair, listening to the testimony.

                                  DR. WINSOR
                    In our Phase I and II trials, we never 
                    once found a causal link between 
                    Zennapril and brain stem stroke.

    DR. STANLEY WINSOR (50 s), a defense expert witness.  Too 
      many degrees, not enough bedside manner. 





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      35.
      CONTINUED:3535


                                  MCCLOON
                    Dr. Winsor, is it possible that Mr. 
                    Demory took a wrong dosage of 
                    Zennapril for his migraine headache?

                                  DR. WINSOR
                    He shouldn t have taken any
                    Zennapril at all.  It s not 
                    indicated for headache relief. 

      McCloon works the jury, eyebrows raised as if this is news. 

                                  MCCLOON
                    Zennapril is notapproved for 
                    migraines?

                                  DR. WINSOR
                    No. It s a powerful drug intended only 
                    for use by patients suffering 
                      schizophrenia.

      Alicia frowns.  Fuck.  Not going well. 


    At a ground floor apartment. Kalinda sees the yellowed 
      nameplate beside the door buzzer,  O. Ravitch. 
        Superintendant.  Kalinda musses up her hair, knocks on the 
      door. Twice more. Fast.  The SUPER finally comes.

                                  KALINDA
                    Oh, thank God. I hope you can help 
                    me. I just locked myself out of 4B,  
                    and I left my purse inside.

                    He left earlier.  Jury duty, I 
                    think, but he said to ask the super 
                    --  Ozzie , right? 

                                  SUPER
                    I never seen you.

                    Look, I know this is awkward, okay? 
                    I met Calvin last night at 
                    Rudy s... around the corner. I came

                    anyway, he let me sleep in while he 
                    went off to... please, I m already 
                    late for work. 

    The Super sucks his teeth, considering, and...  


    The two Associates from the opening.  They stare at Alicia, 
    the chair between them empty, waiting for Golden.  The 
      conference room silent.  Alicia looking around: a bit busy.

      Golden finally charges in, out of breath:

                                  GOLDEN
                    Sorry, Mrs. Florrick.

      Alicia nods: fine.  Golden whispers something to the 
      Associates.  Surprised, they pick up their papers and leave.  
      A second.  Just Golden and Alicia.  

                                    GOLDEN(CONT'D)
                    I wanted to apologize for the other 
                    night.  I sent that basket before 
                    our conversation.  No one will ever 
                    send you anything again.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you.

      Golden clears his throat.  There seems to be more honesty in 
    him now.  Not so many smiles.  More respect, less patronizing.

                                  GOLDEN
                    I don t mean to keep doing this, but I 
                    need to ask another favor.  It s 
                    regarding the videotape you gave me.

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay.

                                  GOLDEN
                    There was a present in it.  A bracelet.

      Alicia stares at him.

                    I need you to look for the receipt.

                                  ALICIA
                    Why?

                          (clears his throat)
                    I want to use the videotape to try to 
                    get Peter a new trial-- I think it s 
                    very effective-- but I m afraid the 
                      prosecution will suggest the present 
                    was not paid for by Peter.

                                  ALICIA
                          (staring at him)
                    Why would they suggest that?

      This is hard for Golden.  He s liking Alicia now.  Maybe 
      there s even a crush there.  

                                  GOLDEN
                    Mrs. Florrick, as you know I 
                      technically don t represent you.  I 
                    represent your husband.  And so, as 
                    much as I would like to be completely 
                      forthcoming with you, in these 
                      circumstances I don t believe I can.

      Alicia studies him.  A bad feeling in her stomach.  Careful:

                                  ALICIA
                    This Kozko, he gave Peter things?  And 
                    you believe he regifted one of these 
                    things-- this bracelet-- to me?

      Golden wants to say more.  Can t.

                                  GOLDEN
                    I can say this: it would be helpful 
                    if we found the receipt.

      Alicia meets his eye.  And...


      ...bang-- Alicia throws open her bureau drawer.  Intent.  
      Flushed.  She finds her jewelry box, opens it.  Digs through 
    the jewelry.  Dumps it out.  No, not there.


      Klunk-- Alicia throws open the pantry door.  Looks through 
    the various cans.  Soup cans.  Creamed corn.  Finds one at 
    the back.  Unscrews the top.  A disguised jewelry safe.  She 
      pours out...

      ...the jewelry.  Finds-- there-- the bracelet.  She stares at 
    it.  Like it was a turd.  Alicia looks closer at the 
      bracelet.  The fastener.  A few letters she can t read. 

                                  JACKIE
                    If it s money you re concerned

      Jackie in the kitchen, wiping up counters.  

                                  ALICIA
                    What?

                                  JACKIE
                    You don t have to be proud. I know 
                    you re carrying a lot of... 
                    responsibility.  The rent alone.

                                  ALICIA
                    Jackie, I am making a decent 
                    salary.

      Alicia crosses to a kitchen drawer, searching through it: 

                                  JACKIE
                    I just want you to know there s 
                    more than enough room.

      Alicia stares at her. Are you fucking kidding? Move in with 
    the mother-in-law?

                                  ALICIA
                    We re okay for now.  But thanks.

    She leaves the kitchen as Alicia sighs, sees her cellphone 
      blinking on the counter:  One message.   She picks it up, 
      hits  dial  as... a woman comes on the line...

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Yeah?

      Alicia looks up, not sure who this is.

                                  ALICIA
                    Kalinda?

                    Hold on.

      Some rustling over the receiver.  Alicia, confused, curious, 
      continues to search the drawer as Kalinda comes on.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      39.

                    Juror #11?

      Okay, Alicia shakes her head: that s the most she ll get out 
    of her.  Alicia finds a credit card magnifying glass in the

                    in cash.

                                  ALICIA
                    And I need a copy for my tax 
                    records.

      A high-end jewelry shop.  Pollock, already at her computer.

                                  MISS POLLOCK
                    It s a beautiful piece.  One of our 
                    finest.  When was it purchased?

                                  ALICIA
                    February or March.  Maybe January.

                                  MISS POLLOCK
                    I m sorry, you said  Florrick?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

                                  MISS POLLOCK
                    I found the receipt, but it s not 
                    under  Florrick.   Might it be 
                    under a different name?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m not sure.  What name do you 
                    have?

      Miss Pollock looks up at her.  Pauses.  

                                  MISS POLLOCK
                    I m sorry, I m not able to give out 
                    that information.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Could the name be  Kozko? 

    But Miss Pollock still stares at her.

                    out that information.

      Alicia nods.  Flustered.


      Kalinda rushes toward an arriving and distracted Alicia...

                                  KALINDA
                    So I tracked down Tober s ex-wife.  
                    She says he was five months behind 
                    on alimony.  Then last week, he 
                    gave her ten grand.  He claimed he 
                    took out a second mortgage on his 
                    house. 

                                  ALICIA
                    So that s it? 

                                  KALINDA
                    The only problem... Tober doesn t 
                    own a house. 

      Alicia stares at her.  

                                  KALINDA (CONT'D)
                    Did you hear me?

                    Yeah.  
                            (distracted)
                    Kalinda.  Do you know a man named 
                    Kozco?

                                  KALINDA
                    Gerald Kozco?  The Real Estate 
                    Developer.  

                                  ALICIA
                          (nods)
                    What does he have to do with my 
                    husband?      

      Kalinda takes a second.  Oh.  That s where Alicia is taking 
      this.

                                  KALINDA
                    I don t know.  Does he have 
                    anything to do with him?  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      42.

                                  KALINDA
                    Two years.

                                  ALICIA
                    And did you ever... see anything?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Like what?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Like...  payoffs and gifts--

                    Oh, I don t know-- I m not even sure 
                    I want to know.  I thought my 
                    marriage was rock-solid.  Now every 
                    rock I turn over, I find a half-
                    dozen more.

      Kalinda isn t comfortable with this doorway into her life:

                                  KALINDA
                    Look.  You don t go to the State s 
                    Attorney s Office to find saints.  
                          (splitting off)
                    I ll get back to you about Tober.  
                    If his pay-off is $35,000, he s 
                    still owed another 15k.  My guess 
                    is he gets it before deliberations.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, that s end of today.    

                                  KALINDA

      We re with Alicia now, watching Juror #11.  Calvin Tober.  
      Staring off into space.  Not listening?  Alicia turns back 
      toward the gallery, sees six other Zennapril families joining

      Behind the courthouse, court staffers and jurors exit through 
    the rear doors.  Faces we recognize.  Sitting in her car, 
      Kalinda keeps an eye on them when--

      --There!  Calvin Tober.  

    He exits, heads down the block, sees a bus pulling up to a 
      stop.  He runs to catch it, as Kalinda keys her ignition to 
      follow.    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      45.




      ...Kalinda coasts up behind it.  Thirty yards back.  She sees 
      Tober get off.  Look around.  

      Something going down here.  Kalinda reaches for her camera.  
      Adjusts the telephoto, watches...

      ...Tober paces back and forth.  Seeing someone pull up, he 
      nods.  Who s he nodding to?  Kalinda whip-pans over, finds...

      ...a black NISSAN.  Pulling up to the curb.  Kalinda zooms in 
    on the driver.  Just the back of her head.  Long hair.  A 
      woman.  Is she redheaded?  Kalinda is about to focus when...

      ...a bus pulls into her view.  Dammit!  Kalinda can t see 
      anything.  She gets out of the car, and...


      Alicia.  Uncomfortable to be back here again.  With the

                    No.  She saw an envelope trade

                    was in the envelope.

                    No.  It was a black Nissan. And 
                    Kalinda got a partial plate.  J15.  
                    She s running it now.  Crossing it

                    silence.  Silence.  Unless I point 
                    to you, youwon t speak.

                                  MCCLOON
                    Your honor--

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                    Sergeant Largon!

      A large suited OFFICER opens the door.  

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN(CONT'D)
                    Just wait there, sergeant.  
                          (back to Diane, McCloon)
                    Anyone who speaks withoutmy 
                    permission will be held in 
                    contempt. 

      Diane.  And McCloon.  Silent.  The slightest edge of growing 
      respect.

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN(CONT'D)
                    The jury has reached its verdict.  
                    I m holding that verdict until we 
                    settle an issue that has arisen.  
                    The foreman has approached me about 
                    being followed by someone from one 
                    of your legal teams.  Who would 
                    that be?  

      A tense second.  Diane masks her surprise, already gauging 
    her options. She raises her hand.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      49.

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN(CONT'D)
                    You may speak.

                                  DIANE
                    Your honor, we had reasons to 
                    believe that Mr. McCloon bribed one 
                    of the jurors.  

      McCloon starts to open his mouth, but Sutman shoots him a 
      look.

                                    DIANE(CONT'D)
                    We intended to bring these charges 
                    to your honor, but we first wanted 
                    to be certain of our information.  

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                    And so you had one of the jurors 
                    followed?

      Diane.  She takes a second.  Can t explain it.  McCloon 
      raises his hand.  An eager student.  The judge points to him.

                                  MCCLOON
                    Your honor, I am stunned!  I am--!

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                    Mr. McCloon, without the outrage 
                    please.

                                  MCCLOON
                    Clearly Miss Lockhart has nothing 
                    solid and she s trying to torpedo 
                    this verdict before it comes in.  
                    She s worried it won t go in her 
                    favor.

      Diane shoots a pissed look toward McCloon.  He shoots one 
      back.

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                    Okay, Ms. Lockart, I m holding you 
                    in contempt for having a juror 
                    followed.  You owe the legal 
                    defense fund $80,000 to be paid no 
                    later than Friday of next week.

                                  MCCLOON
                    And I think I am damn well owed an 
                    apology --




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      50.

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                    Ah, ah - I didn t point at you. 
                    That ll be $10,000, Mr. McCloon. 
                    Now, we are all going back into 
                    that courtroom and we are all 
                    living with this verdict.  

      Diane closes her eyes.  Damn. 

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN(CONT D)
                    And if you have evidence of jury 
                    tampering, Miss Lockhart, take it 
                    up on appeal.  Too many people have 
                    selflessly invested their time for 
                    your playground tactics to throw 
                    this into mistrial.  That s it.


    All rise in the courtroom as the jury files in.  Twelve 
      normal people.  

      A disappointed and worried Alicia watches them, keeps a 
      lingering eye on Calvin Tober heading toward his seat.  She 
      turns, trades a look with Kalinda.  Well, here we go.  Also 
    in the gallery...

      ...Carol squeezes her husband s hand while behind them, three 
      other victims wait.  The Gerber family.  A young woman with 
      crutches.  A teenager in a wheelchair.  All nervous.

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                    Ladies and gentleman of the jury 
                    have you reached a verdict?

      Calvin Tober stands.  The first time we hear him:

                                  CALVIN TOBER
                    Yes, your honor.  

      Diane glances back at Alicia.  Here we go. 

                                  JUDGE SUTMAN
                    And what is your verdict?

                                  CALVIN TOBER
                          (reads)
                    "We, the jury, find for Raymond 
                    Demory and against the defendant 
                    Zennapril Pharmaceutical. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      50A.
      CONTINUED:5050


    The courtroom erupts.  Alicia blinks, stunned.  They won.  
    She didn t expect that.  Diane is thrilled, shoots a 
      competitive look toward a depressed McCloon.

                    And we assess damages in the sum of 
                    $800,000 in compensatory damages 
                    and 3 million in punitive damages. 

    Oh my god.  Carol s eyes widen, stunned, squeezing Ray s 
      hand.  Behind them, the Zennapril families start crying, 
      while...

      ...the pharmaceutical executives immediately and sharply 
      stand, start out.  Diane collects her files, her briefcase, 
      stands, and smiles at Alicia as she passes.

      McCloon holds the gallery gate open for her, nodding  Nicely 
      played.   

                                  MCCLOON
                    Settle and I won t pursue an 
                    appeal.  

                                  DIANE
                    I still have my class action 
                    clients. 

                                  MCCLOON
                    Right... I ll get you some numbers 
                    by day s end..

      Diane nods good, walks out the gate as Alicia, hearing this, 
      smiles, looks back toward the victims hugging.  Thrilled.


      A party.  In the large conference room.  Champagne.  A spread 
    of food.  Lawyers.  Will refills Diane s flute, extolling her 
      victory to the gathered partners. A happy relieved time.  
      And...

      ...Alicia watches it through the glass.  Not feeling festive 
    at the moment.  She sees Diane moving through the party, 
      accepting congratulations.  She comes out into the hall, sees 
      Alicia.  Smiles.

                                  ALICIA
                    They bribed the foreman.  Our 
                    clients did.

      Diane reacts, masking some surprise. She nods Alicia into her 
      office across the hall.


      It s dark.  Just a desk light.  Beautiful cityscape outside.  

                                  ALICIA
                    They drive a black Nissan.  Their 
                    license plate has the prefix J15.  
                    There was no whistle-blower.  Our 
                    clients bribed the jury.  

                                  DIANE
                    Maybe.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #103    "Fixed"    PINK COLLATED     8/24/09      54.

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  It s true.  We have to bring 
                    this to the judge.  

      Diane smiles benignly at Alicia.

                                  DIANE
                    We already did.  You were there.  
                    We brought our suspicions to the 
                    judge and he overruled us.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, but now we know.

                                  DIANE
                    We fulfilled our obligations under 
                    the law. 

      Alicia stares at her.  Almost under her breath:

                                  ALICIA
                    It s wrong.  

                                  DIANE
                    No.  We follow the law, Alicia.  
                    Sometimes it s wrong, sometimes 
                    it s right.  But we always follow 
                    the law.  And today, you helped a 
                    lot of people in pain find justice.   

       Justice?   There s the word.  Alicia stares at Diane as she 
      takes a moment, returns to the party, leaving Alicia alone.  


      Peter Florrick.  He sits in his prison blues.  Smiling.  The 
      sound of the rustling of papers.  Staring at him is...

      ...Alicia.  Sitting across the table in a prison attorney 
      meeting room.  Minimum security visible through the window.  
      She s still stone-faced, preoccupied.  The Diane conversation 
      fresh in her mind.

                                  PETER
                    How are you doing?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Good.

      Sitting at the table with them is Golden, feeling like an 
      interloper, busying himself with sorting through depositions.

                    It is.  It s good.

      Peter laughs:

                    You sound like Grace.   How s

                    Fun as Disneyland.

      Peter smiles, agreeing. He reaches for Alicia s hand.

                    Daniel and I want to talk to you
