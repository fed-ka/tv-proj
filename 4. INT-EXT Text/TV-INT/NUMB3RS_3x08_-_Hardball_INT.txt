                That s very civic minded.  Unless 
                this was more about the federal 
                grand jury probe into baseball 
                doping.

                I don t want anyone here to be 
                accused of trying to hide anything 
                from a grand jury.  And not from 
                the league, either.

                The death of baseball player Vick  *
                Johnston was the result of a  *
                massive hemorrhage in the brain.

                              GOMEZ
                From the damage to the vessels, his 
                blood pressure must have 
                  skyrocketed.     

                              DAVID
                Can steroids cause that?

                  Normally, no.  But here s the 
                thing: Johnston had vials  *
                  containing a designer steroid -- 
                  Thoracyclene.  Most contain  *
                  Thoracyclene in a form safe to  *
                inject -- if you don t mind long-
                term risks of cancer, heart 
                problems and impotency.

                              COLBY
                  Apparently he didn t.  

  Gomez picks up an evidence bag containing a single VIAL.

                              GOMEZ
                But this vial holds a concentration 
                30 times greater.  This strength 
                would likely cause a catastrophic 
                rise in blood pressure.    

                              COLBY
                This was an accidental overdose?    

                              GOMEZ
                No way.  Thoracyclene is never  *
                produced or distributed at this 
                  strength.  This vial was specially 
                  prepared.  

                              DAVID
                It was intended to be lethal. 

                              GOMEZ
                It s hard to see another purpose.

  Charlie enters.  BILL WALDIE pitches a baseball to Larry. 

                              CHARLIE
                Nice pitch.

                              LARRY
                We re conducting a little hands-on 
                study of the physical properties of 
                the classic curveball.

                                WALDIE
                Did you know Newton was interested 
                in curveballs?  I mean, baseball 
                clearly wasn t around in his day, 
                but he was fascinated by how a ball 
                can curve through air.

                              LARRY
                And who wouldn t be?  It s all  *
                fluid dynamics.

  Waldie demonstrates the hand position and spin as he talks.

                                WALDIE
                The spin the pitcher puts on the 
                ball creates an imbalance of drag 
                force on either side, thus an 
                  imbalance of air pressure.  The 
                ball curves.  Hitting that pitch is 
                one of the hardest feats in sports. 

                              LARRY
                Charles, you said your question was 
                more one of matters statistical.

                Yes, this is what I m looking at.

  catch to study them.

                The coaches and the other players

                about what he could do for the 
                team.  The only person who really 
                cared about Vick was his agent,  *
                Richard Clast.  Vick trusted him,  *
                said Richard wasn t looking for a 
                quick buck, was thinking long term.

                This was the last year on his 
                  contract.  No other teams were 
                  interested in picking him up 
                because he d hurt his shoulder, 
                plus the two knee surgeries.  He 
                needed to get his game back up -- 
                he said the money he made now had 
                to last us the next 40 years.

                Yes, and he would have made it.

                Yeah?  What were Vick s options?   *
                He was drafted out of high school -- 
                he didn t have another career to 
                fall back on.  He d be lucky to be 
                get a job making 33K a year 
                coaching some JC team.  You seen 
                his wife, think she s gonna hang 
                around for much of that?  His kids 
                worship their baseball star dad.  
                They gonna look up to a used-car

                Maybe I m cynical, but I ve seen a 
                lot of wives move on after the 
                baseball money stops.

                over his career, Bennett was able 
                to prove that Jackson played to his 
                full potential in every game of the 
                1919  Black Sox  series.

  Follow Kittner as he rushes headlong through the underground 
  mall -- barely avoiding obstacles and crashing through a 
  Japanese kite stand.  Colby still in pursuit -- barely.


  Megan looks down at Oswald. 

                              KITTNER 
                Before you put me on the next 
                flight to Gitmo, I d like to 
                exercise some legal rights.  

  She drops copies of the email attachments on the table.

                              KITTNER (CONT'D)
                What are these supposed to be?

                We ve talked to some smart people,

  Oswald fights back a quick smile of pride.  Megan sees it.

                              KITTNER
                They re blowing smoke up -- your

                I win a lot at Fantasy Baseball, 
                somebody probably wanted to get a 
                look at my research.

                              MEGAN
                  Competition must be pretty 
                  cutthroat.

                One league I play in, winner gets  *
                fifteen thousand.  Enough to 
                justify a little B&E. 
                      (shrugs)
                So me and my laptop went off the 
                grid for a while.     *

  Don comes in, followed by Charlie, carrying a folder.   

                              DON
                Oswald, meet Dr. Charles Eppes.  
                  Professor of mathematics at CalSci.

                              KITTNER
                Maybe he can tell you about all  *
                this stuff here, because it s way 
                over my head.

  Charlie opens the folder, hands a paper to Kittner. 

                              CHARLIE 
                I don t think it is.  It s similar  *
                to this work, which you posted on a 
                baseball stats website under your 
                own name.  You re the only person 
                using these abbreviations.     

  Kittner looks at what Charlie s given him. 

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                And it works, too.  Your analysis 
                  accurately spots steroid use.  

  Kittner thinks, then --

                              KITTNER
                Okay, Good Will Hunting, it s my 
                work and that s what it does.  But 
                here s the thing --  I didn t email 
                it to Vick Johnston.  I never  *
                showed it to anybody.

                              KITTNER
                It s a significant advantage in 
                fantasy baseball -- if nobody else 
                knows about it.

                Rangers I hit .228 with 36 RBIs.  
                With steroids, maybe it would ve 
                been 260 with 50 ribbies.  That s 
                what my back-up did, he wound up in  *
                the majors.  *

                But that would have been cheating. *

                              DON *
                Is it cheating when everyone else  *
                is doing it? *

                              ALAN *
                Yes.  But you also would have  *
                risked cancer and heart trouble --  *
                just to play a game.

                Chris was a good guy.  He would 
                never blackmail anybody.  The 
                emails never asked for money, did 
                they?  If they came from Chris, I

                I made two evaluations.  One if you 
                  continued to develop normally -- 
                and one if you had used steroids.

                              ALAN
                This ought to be interesting.

                              KITTNER
                With steroids, you probably would 
                have raised your batting average to 
                .280 with 10 to 15 home runs.

                              DON
                Guys who did that made the majors.

                              KITTNER
                Some.  Not all.  The problem is, 
                while your hitting would have 
                  improved, your overall value as a 
                player would have diminished.

                              ALAN
                How so?

                              KITTNER
                Don s value was as a utility 
                player.  You didn t excel at one 
                  position, you played several very 
                well.  You were an ace fielder and 
                you were quick, physically and 
                  mentally.  Steroids would have 
                messed with that.

                              DON
                And without drugs?

                              KITTNER
                Hard to say.  A lot of major league 
                clubs like to have a few utility  *
                players on the bench -- guys who 
                are smart and can adapt to 
                  different situations quickly.

                              ALAN
                The FBI likes that, too.

                  enhancement drugs also have 
                legitimate purposes.  Along with 
                growth problems, steroids treat

                Problem is, altering the body s

                              MEGAN
                And you supplied him with 
                  Thoracyclene. *

                                SHEVERANSKY
                I was the only person he trusted.

                              DON
                He called you two days before he 
                died.  

                                SHEVERANSKY
                No, I don t remember that. 

  Megan pushes a paper across the table to Sheveransky.

                              MEGAN
                Phone records indicate you talked 
                to him twice, once for 46 minutes, 
                a second time for 37.  What about?  

                              DON
                We can make sure the last team you 
                manage is in federal prison.

                                SHEVERANSKY
                All right.  Vick said he thought he  *
                was going to be exposed.

                By who?

                                SHEVERANSKY
                He wouldn t say.  He just said it 
                was going to get out.  That if he 
                got caught, he d have to give my 
                name to the grand jury.  

                              DON
                You tell anybody about this call?

                                SHEVERANSKY
                Not a soul.  Not even my wife.

                              MEGAN
                What did you do?

                                SHEVERANSKY
                I didn t know what to do.  And then 
                -- Vick died.  *

                              DON
                The drug you supplied killed him.

                                SHEVERANSKY
                I don t understand how.  It was the 
                same stuff everybody gets.

                BRX sold to the doctor, the doctor  *
                sold to the high school coach.  And 
                the coach sold to Vick Johnston.  *

                We know the chain of supply.  But 
                it doesn t pinpoint which one 
                killed Johnston.  And neither has a  *
                link to the murdered fantasy 
                baseball player.

                              DAVID
                Both the coach and the doctor have 
                alibis.  When Bronmiller died, 
                  Sheveransky was in Sacramento, the 
                doctor was in Las Vegas.

  Charlie writes on his blackboard.  Larry consults a notebook, 
  adds to an expression on it.  Kittner watches.  

  The chalkboard divided into sectors, each labeled:  PLAYERS, 
  TEAMS, DOCTORS, TRAINERS, MANUFACTURER etc.  There is a 
    mathematical value-assessment for each.

                              KITTNER *
                So I nearly get shot.  And you guys  *

                              CHARLIE *
                That s how we roll at CalSci.  *
                      (going serious) *
                Don says somebody wants to get rid  *

                We re trying to find who has that  *
                motive.   *

  Charlie stands back, regards his board full of work.

                              CHARLIE *
                You seeing what I m seeing?

                              KITTNER
                Dude, honestly, all I see is a lot 
                of chalk.  Are the numbers supposed 
                to be glowing or something?

                              LARRY
                I ve known particular expressions 
                to take on a shimmering quality.

  Kittner gives Larry a look.

                Thank you Dr. Kittner.  It only  *
                took us hours of value assessment

                Hasn t your brother taught you 
                anything about crime?  It s always 
                the guy who stands to lose or gain 
                the most amount of money.

                              LARRY 
                  Thoracyclene is valuable because  *
                there s no test for it.  Your work  *
                destroys that value.  

                              CHARLIE
                And then there s this.

  He pulls down the second chalkboard.  A organizational chart -
    - entities linked to Johnston and Bronmiller. *

                              KITTNER

  Charlie draws a big circle around LAB COMPANY.  It s 
  connected by many lines to Johnston.  Not to Bronmiller. *

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                We re quantifying links between the  *
                elements in this case.  Note:  the  *
                drug lab is linked to everybody. 

                              KITTNER
                But -- how would the drug lab know

                              MEGAN (O.S.)
                That s a good question.

  Megan comes in. *

                The drug lab s central to the case.   *
                And the only local source of  *

                              LARRY

                              ALAN
                You played with it constantly.  
                Your mother and I didn t think that 
                was healthy.  We figured baseball 
                would get your mind off it.  And it 
                did -- for a couple decades.

  Charlie comes back with three beers, he gives one to Alan. 
  Don, thinking hard, realizing what Alan s saying is true--

                              ALAN (CONT D)
                You loved baseball, but it wasn t 
                your first love.  As a kid, you 
                were always playing cops and 
                robbers.  And Donnie, you were 
                always the cop. 

  A strange look on Don s face.  Realization.  Charlie hands 
  him a beer.  Then raises his own to him.

                              CHARLIE 
                To Don Eppes.  A born cop, and a 
                most excellent one.

                              ALAN
                Hear hear.

  Off Don -- getting his head around what Alan just told him.
