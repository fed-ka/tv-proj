A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun
dips behind the mountains.
In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the
sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and
very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an
invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of
transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve
settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA
ADJUSTS and reveals--

Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur
repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But
now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long
shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly
from within; it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. If
the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW
MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with
flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign.
As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE
rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to
enclose them all, he goes inside.

The sun almost gone now, red light reflecting on the gabled
windows. Even the battered VW van looks good in this
setting. It's beautiful.
CYNTHIA'S VOICE
No!
No...
HARRIS' VOICE
Cynthia, come back! We can't do it
without you... We must have unity,
my lovechild... Unity, now and
through eternity... Cynthia, you
cannot run... You belong to us
forever--!
Pause. The faint SOUNDS of SPLASHING and then FOOTSTEPS
skittering on tired wooden floors... and then--
--UNITY HOUSE EXPLODES!

EXPLOSION - ANOTHER ANGLE

WINDOWS blow out. Splintered BEAMS propeller through the
air. The VW camper on the lawn ROCKS with the shock wave.
Then a SECOND EXPLOSION blows the Victorian cupolas and
widow's walk off the roof. From somewhere in the distance we
HEAR SIRENS...

FIRE is CONSUMING what's left of the building. Rescue
workers and firefighters are running back and forth.

INSPECTOR WASSERMAN

A plainclothes detective, he NODS to some uniforms, steps
around some debris to move closer to the scene. He puts his
collar up against the SPRAY which leaks from firehose
connections. Seeing one of his men, he SHOUTS over the din.
WASSERMAN
What have we got?
POLICEMAN
Twenty-four bodies, Inspector.
Maybe more.

CONTINUED:
As he says this, both men watch as firefighters carry out a
SCORCHED AND BLACKENED CORPSE that looks like a 3,000 year
old mummy.
10
CORPSE - CLOSER

It's set down on the ground beside other blackened bodies
partially covered by tarps. As the body is set down it
CRUNCHES, and a piece BREAKS OFF.

BACK TO SCENE

Wasserman blanches, wipes his mouth.
WASSERMAN
Cause of fire?
OFFICER
Some kind of explosion... gas main,
methane, too soon to tell. God
only knows.
WASSERMAN
Let's hope He doesn't keep it to
Himself.
A VOICE
We got one! We got a survivor! Get
a stretcher and oxygen over here,
STAT!
Wasserman and the cop run up the slope with the others.
12
RUINS - CLOSER
12
Medics run around the parked VW, which drips water and
chemical foam. Rescue workers move a FALLEN BEAM and pull a
soot-blackened form out of a hole. As the CAMERA PUSHES
closer, we see that it is Cynthia. Her clothes are torn and
singed, and she is unconscious, but as they work on her we
see that she is largely unharmed.
VOICES
(busy, frantic)
Make room, make room! Get that
airway in! I got a pulse, whoa,
it's faint... Talk about lucky,
she musta fallen in the basement...
First and second degree burns...
Come on people, move your asses!
(CONTINUED)

Wasserman tries to keep up as they carry her on a stretcher
towards an ambulance, put her inside. It ROARS AWAY, SIREN
WAILING. MUSIC COMES UP AND OVER-- it's MAGIC CARPET RIDE by
Steppenwolf.
NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
(filtered)
--Authorities continue to
investigate yesterday's mysterious
explosion and fire at Unity House,
the controversial New Age commune
headed by self-styled Guru Adrian
Harris. 32 people died in the
blaze. Thirteen year old Cynthia
Weston, the fire's only survivor,
remains in guarded but stable
condition at County General. In
national news, newspaper heiress
Patricia Hearst was abducted from
her Bay area apartment shortly
before dawn today... A communique
from the so-called "Symbionese
Liberation Army" demanded that...

Berrisford parks her and site down across from her.
CYNTHIA
What... what kind of doctor did
you say you were?
Berrisford notices one of the tissues on his neck.
Scowls,
flicks it away.
BERRISFORD
Obviously, I'm not a surgeon.
(as she laughs)
I'm a psychiatrist.
CYNTHIA
(puzzled)
Why do I need a psychiatrist?
BERRISFORD
Cynthia, you've been out of touch
with reality for over ten years.
Your recovery goes beyond your
muscle tone... You have to ease
into life... into interacting with
other people again. Into a world
that's changed so much that
sometimes I get confused by it.
(taking out an appointment
book)
Now, my assistant Dr. Goldman has a
group therapy session every day...
I'm putting you down for it,
starting tomorrow...

Group therapy? But--

NEW ANGLE

Revealing Wasserman.
He shows his badge to the doctor.
WASSERMAN
I'm Lieutenant Wasserman. I left a
message with your secretary...?
BERRISFORD
(rising, meeting him
halfway)
And I left one with your desk
sergeant.
(a hard whisper)
I told you this would have to wait.
You shouldn't even be here--
24
FAVORING CYNTHIA
24
She can't help but listen as they continue in lowered tones.
WASSERMAN
I've waited fifteen years. That's
long enough. Now I want to speak
with Miss Weston.
BERRISFORD
Miss Weston is still recovering and
is in no condition for a prolonged
interrogation.
WASSERMAN
(tight smile)
Then don't prolong it. I'll be
brief with her, I'll be gentle with
her--
BERRISFORD
I'll let you know when she's ready--
CYNTHIA
E--excuse me...

They turn and look at her.
CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
Doctor Berrisford, what's this all
about...? This man wants to talk
to me...?
Berrisford starts to answer, but Wasserman rushes in.
WASSERMAN
(quietly, slowly, as if to
a child)
That's right, Miss Weston. I just
have a few easy, simple questions.
(patient, phony smile)
About you... and about Unity House.
Cynthia looks at him strangely, turns to Berrisford.
CYNTHIA
(sotto)
Why is he talking like that? Is he
one of your patients?
Wasserman burns.
Berrisford LAUGHS.
BERRISFORD
Lieutenant Wasserman is a police
officer. And the word "patience"
isn't part of his vocabulary.
Wasserman scowls, not enjoying being the butt of a joke.
He
resumes his normal tons, which is far from diplomatic.
WASSERMAN
Miss Weston. What's the last thing
you remember before...
CYNTHIA
--Before the accident?
Nothing.
WASSERMAN
Then how do you know it was an
accident?
BERRISFORD
Lieutenant!
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED: (3)
CYNTHIA
I remember... a beautiful sunset.
Harris, smiling at me...
WASSERMAN
(writing)
Harris, he was the leader?
Cynthia's eyes are far away.
The memories come back...
the
words are slow, but vivid.
CYNTHIA
Leader, founder... chief cook and
bottlewasher...
(smiling)
Executive in charge of Dreaming.
We were all together... all
working to make a now world...
That last night, there was a...
(brow furrowing)
Gathering... a... a sort of...
baptism... And then...
She winces, rubs her eyes.
CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, that's all I can see.
WASSERMAN
Miss Weston. This "Unity House"...
was it a cult?
CYNTHIA
I'm sorry.
I don't understand the
question.
BERRISFORD
A "cult," Cynthia. A syndrome of
society you have been fortunate
enough to miss. They're popular
with impressionable people, the
penny press...
(pause)
...and lazy policemen who like to
blame them for crimes they can't
solve.
Wasserman closes his notebook, gives Berrisford a cold stare.
WASSERMAN
I was there that night, Doctor. I
watched them stack those bodies...

like 2,000 year old mummies. They
broke apart like 2,000 year old
mummies.
Cynthia gasps.
WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
If it was an accident... fine. If
it wasn't... the person
responsible could still be out
there.
(pause)
And he's probably as interested in
Miss Weston's memory as I am.
He turns, nods to Cynthia.
WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
Feel better.
He goes out.
Cynthia's breath comes in short gasps.
Finally
she calms.
CYNTHIA
I don't like that man.
BERRISFORD
That makes two of us.
He sits beside her again.
BERRISFORD (CONT'D)
But as long as you're here...
(smiling)
I can keep him away.
CAMERA TIGHTENS on Cynthia as she considers this...
CUT TO:

Victor takes her hand, and they run towards a battered VW
van. We recognize it and its slogans.
CYNTHIA

You've still got Zeke!
She runs her hand along the dusty side lovingly, and then
they hop inside.

Rusted, dated 1973.
The van DRIVES AWAY.

She looks back.

She gets out of the car and goes in the main entrance.

They pull up in front, park.
Go inside.
CAMERA LINGERS long enough for us to notice a puddle from an
OIL LEAK exactly where "Zeke" was parked.
THE MUSIC FADES OUT.

She SLAMS into a tree.
We see the Unity House in the
distance.
VOICE
Cynthia!
ANOTHER VOICE
She's trying to get away!
There are PEOPLE pounding through the brush all around her.
She gets up and runs along the path into the forest.
VOICE
Cynthia! We want you to stay with
us! You mustn't be afraid!
She is in total panic, running blindly.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
CYNTHIA
Please, no.
Branches thrash her face. She can barely see where she is
going, but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark
precipice, a cliff which seemingly has no bottom--just black
as night.
The people are getting nearer.
FEMALE VOICE
She's over here.
We see someone nearing through the brush.
HARRIS
No pain, Cynthia. There's no pain.
Come with us. Share with us. Take
my hand.
Cynthia looks down the cliff.
ORDERLY'S VOICE
Take my hand.
Cynthia backs away. She starts lowering herself down, trying
to get footing. Some rocks slide out.

99
The CAMERA IS MOVING FORWARD, TOWARDS the window.
It seemingly goes OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW.
The FRAME is filled with bright blue sky.
Silence, except for a slight BREEZE.
Someone is falling through the sky.
It is MIRIAM.
We see her CLOSER, flowing down, the wind rushing up round
her. She is happy.
MIRIAM
Cynthia, it's really quite
beautiful.
The ground comes rushing up and we SLAM into it.
BLACK.
FADE IN:

147
The imposing facade of the old Victorian with its warmly lit
windows looks inviting. The three make their way over the
lawn up the path towards the front porch. An evening BREEZE
is just coming up.
Cynthia looks around, absorbing the environment. The
policeman and the nurse say nothing. Cynthia turns to them.
CYNTHIA
Would you like to come in?
NURSE
No, thank you.
Cynthia steps inside.

171A
Alan comes out, still fuming. He walks along a ways and then
looks at the illuminated SIGN pointing out the way to the
"Berrisford Clinic." Alan stares at it, then in a sudden
release of fury, KICKS it, once, twice, and then he THROWS
his carton at it.
Calming, feeling like an idiot, he sighs.
ALAN
Brilliant. Do we feel better now?
No. Yes. Maybe.
A thought strikes him.
He reaches into his shirt pocket,
takes out--

ago.

papers and things, heads for the parking lot.

PULLBACK as Alan unlocks it, his carton momentarily balanced
on the car roof. The door open, Alan gets in, puts his box

Berrisford dodges in and out of cars, behind lamp posts.
Manic, Alan follows him relentlessly, skidding around turns,
SIDESWIPING as many cars as budget allows. Finally--

BERRISFORD

finds himself against a wall--as TIRES SKID in he SCREAMS--

INSIDE ALAN'S CAR

He SLAMS Berrisford against the wall. Berrisford's body
SMACKS against the bricks, rebounds onto the windshield,
CRACKING IT.
Alan recoils from the impact, blood on his lips from his own
collision with the steering wheel. He looks at Berrisford,
squirming a foot away with the little life left in him.
Alan CACKLES, gives Berrisford the finger.
Then he throws the car into reverse.

BERRISFORD - QUICK CUTS

INSIDE THE CAR

The blood hits the windshield.
Idly, distracted, Alan turns
on the windshield wipers...
Suddenly HARRIS sits up in the rear seat, a smile on the
burned and scarred face.
HARRIS
Good work, Dr. Goldman.
Now, it's

Skeletal hands GRAB Alan's throat.
He STRUGGLES.
KICKS--out

PARKING LOT

The box of his possessions is still on the roof of the car.

He CHANGES from Berrisford to Harris with each FLASH.
He

Almost politely, he tries to undo Alan's grip.

Berrisford HOWLS and suddenly his calm demeanor cracks.
Snarling like an animal, he stomps, claws and even bites at
Alan's hand.
ALAN (CONT'D)

Don't you hear him? He's trying to
bribe me--but I'm not letting go!
I'll go with you, but I'm not

Berrisford sees the discarded gun... picks it up. He aims
unsteadily... SHOOTS. Alan yanks himself out of the way.
Berrisford misses. Berrisford moves closer. Raises the g=

Berrisford SHOOTS. One of Alan's finger joints is BLOWN

begins to POUND on Alan's mutilated hand.

She starts to climb up, but she can't.
CYNTHIA (CONT'D)

I'm afraid it's too late for that.
Alan's grip on her slips down to two fingers. They CRACK.
She yells from the pain. She swings in the breeze.
Alan is weakening.
He is losing consciousness.
He knows he
is about to die.
GUARD
Dr. Berrisford?
Suddenly Berrisford freezes.
He is paralyzed at the sight of one of the guards coming up

Alan GROANS.
The guard rushes over.
GUARD (CONT'D)

Gomez, get up here!
The other guard appears.
They start helping Alan up by Pulling his arm. As they help
him up, Berrisford, in a state of shock, backs further up the
wall. He leans against the wall and puts the gun to his
head. He trembles. He pulls the trigger.
CLICK.
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. Out of bullets. The others are too
