      KAT (28).  Typing furiously on an old laptop as the cab jerks 
      its way through traffic.   Stealing a glimpse of the computer 
      screen, we see the title of the important document she s 
      working on: The Best Butt Jeans.

      Kat is the good girl.  The kind who visits her Grandfather 
      every week at the retirement home and won't fart in front of 
      her boyfriend.  She apologizes when someone bumps into her.

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    I broke my wrist in college.  Not 
                    really an exciting story.  My whole 
                    dorm floor was down in Hayden 
                    Lange s room -- the mind-boggling 
                    hot RA who wasn t much for 
                    enforcing rules.  Hayden was 
                    hosting a beer pong tournament 
                    (case in point) and I was in my 
                    room, studying for a huge test the 
                    next morning.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      2.

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I had a glass of V-8 in one hand 
                    and I was trying to open a freshly-
                    popped bag of microwave popcorn 
                    with the other.  When I finally 
                    managed to rip it open with my 
                    teeth, my entire face was flash 
                    fried by the hot steam.  I dropped 
                    the V-8, slipped in it and slammed 
                    my wrist against my desk.  

      The taxi lurches to a stop.  Kat slides off the seat and 
      smashes into the plastic partition.  Laptop and all.  

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Should ve just gone to the party.  

      They ve hit traffic.  Kat checks her watch, gathers her 
      stuff, throws money at the driver, jumps out and tears down a 
      crowded avenue...


      Chaos.  Everyone s yelling, fingers flying... except REBECCA  
      (29).  She s the tough one.  Calm, cool and ballsy in a 
      playful way.  Rebecca's got no edit button.  If you re lucky 
      enough to gain her trust, this woman will kill for you... if 
      not, she might kill you.  

      Rebecca stands in the middle of the mayhem watching the 
      screen... playing with an earring like she's bored in church.

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    Rebecca, my dorm mate at the time, 
                    came home and immediately wrote a 
                    scathing letter to the popcorn 
                    company.  Ten huge boxes of 
                    microwave popcorn arrived the next 
                    week.  Each with a brand new 
                    warning label: CAUTION. MIGHT FRY 
                    FACE.  I m paraphrasing, but you 
                    get the point...

      Then when the trading clock has less than a minute on it --

                                    REBECCA
                    Ten-fifty best one-hundred K!

      The place erupts.  Everyone jumps on her.  Papers fly.  Bell 
      rings.  Time's up.  As she organizes her bids AN ATTRACTIVE 
      TRADER approaches.

                                  ATTRACTIVE TRADER
                    Well, thanks...  For completely 
                    screwing me.                                                                                      3.


                                    REBECCA
                    I know, I m sorry.  I m just so 
                    good at it...
                          (steps a closer)
                    Speaking of, you still want to  
                    meet later?

                                  ATTRACTIVE TRADER
                    Know what?  I don t think so.  Bye, 
                    Rebecca.

      We see the slightest glimpse of vulnerability creep over 
      Rebecca's face as she watches him go.  Almost a perfect poker 
      face.  Almost.


      CLOSE ON: ZOEY (29) as she sings and plays guitar in front of 
    a group of smiling kids.  She s dressed like a giant worm.  

      Zoey s quirky, imaginative and free-spirited.  Fun personified.

                                  ZOEY
                          (singing)
                     With a ho, ho, ho and a hey, hey, 
                    hey, I think it s time to play and 
                    say: A ha, ha, ha and a hoo, hoo, 
                    hoo.  You love me and I love you. 

      PULL BACK to see an entire TV crew and a few other adults 
      dressed like giant insects.  Seems she s on a kid s show a la 
      Barney.  Zoey puts down her guitar and starts doing the 
      running man alongside a couple kids.

                                  ZOEY AND KIDS
                          (singing)
                     We love each other like peanut and 
                    butter! 

      She gets a little close to an OBNOXIOUS BOY, who shoves her.  
      They whisper back and forth:                                                                                        4.


                                  OBNOXIOUS LITTLE BOY
                    Stop stepping on me, bug.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m trying to dance.

                                  OBNOXIOUS LITTLE BOY
                    Yeah well, you suck.

                                  ZOEY
                    Least I m not gonna end up in rehab.

      Zoey shoots him a big smile.  The kid shoves her again -- 
      harder, this time -- and she falls over.  She flips him the 
      bird with her giant gloved hand.   

      ON A MONITOR SCREEN: the glove is pixilated.  Her smile s 
      even bigger.

                                  DIRECTOR 
                    Cut!  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    The girl barely drinks but somehow, 
                    she won that beer-pong 
                      tournament... and slept with the 
                      mind-boggling Hayden... 


      Kat limps/runs up the steps and through the lobby.  Hits the 
      elevator button a few hundred times till it opens and she 
      steps inside...  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    Oh, and the next morning?  She aced 
                    the test.  I, however, got a B minus. 

      As the doors slide closed...


      Fish tank.  Bad hotel art.  Up, Up and Away, in My Beautiful 
      Balloon tinkling away on Musak.  Zoey fills out a form, 
      headed: NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE.  Definitely not the 
      dentist s office.  A RECEPTIONIST pokes her head out a door.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    The doctor will be with you in just 
                    a minute.

      Zoey nods.  Her face says she s five years-old and about to 
      get a tooth pulled.                                                                                        5.


      A woman in a wheel chair exits the patient door, smiles 
      weakly at Zoey as she leaves.  The fish tank gurgles.  
      Patient door opens again.  

                                  RECEPTIONIST (CONT D)
                    Okay, Miss Cruz, we re ready for-- 
                    Miss Cruz?

      Exit door swings closed.  Zoey's gone.


      Kat stands beside a printer -- willing it to go faster -- as 
      it spits out her finished article.  She grabs it then rushes 
      through a busy office, comes to a door, knocks, barrels in.  
        A sophisticated BOSS LADY sits behind a desk.  

                                  KAT
                    Made it!  Hi!  I was picking up my 
                    wedding dress, and then traffic, 
                    and my shoe and I thought I was 
                    gonna be late.  But I m good, 
                      everything s good.  Anyway, I have 
                    the article.

                                  BOSS LADY
                          (grave)
                    Kat, it s okay.  Sit down.

                                  KAT
                    You re not happy with the art work.  
                    That s okay, there are a lot of 
                    other butts to pick-- 

                                  BOSS LADY
                    No, Kat, that s not it--  I respect 
                    you, so I m gonna get right to it...  
                    You know the magazine circulation 
                    isn t what it used to be... 
                          (sighs)

                                  BOSS LADY (CONT'D)
                    Kat, there s no nice way to say 
                    this -- we re eliminating your 
                    position.  Your duties are being... 
                    absorbed.  I m so sorry.

      Off Kat, blind-sided.  Devastated.

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                      Sometimes, no matter what I do.  
                    How right I play it.  The popcorn 
                    still blows up in my face. 

      SMASH TO TITLE CARD:  Roam  by the B-52 s plays.


      Kat sits between Rebecca and Zoey, head in hands on the bar.  
      Empty cocktail glasses abound.  

                                    REBECCA
                    You re getting wasabi peas in your 
                    hair, honey.  Sit up.

                                  KAT
                    I worked so hard, compromised so 
                    much.  For what?  How the hell am I 
                    gonna get another job in this market?
                          (waves at Bartender)
                    Can I get another martini and 
                    something sharp, please?

                                  ZOEY
                    I say you don t get another job.  I 
                    say you take this as a sign to go 
                    on my trip with me.

                                    REBECCA
                    What trip?

                                  ZOEY
                    Funny.

                                  KAT
                    You re insane.  You re going away 
                    for a year.  I can t take a 
                    vacation for a year.

                                  ZOEY
                    We re talking backpacking through 
                    South America, Asia, Africa, 
                      Australia...  It s not a vacation, 
                    it s an experience.                                                                                        7.


                                  KAT
                    An experience you ve been planning 
                    for, what?  Nine years?  And you 
                    expect me to just take off in a week?

                                  ZOEY
                    Actually, I m leaving tomorrow.

                        KATREBECCA
      You re what?  Why?

                                  ZOEY (CONT D)
                    I moved up my flight.   

                                  KAT
                    You couldn t wait one more week?

                                  ZOEY
                    No.  Everything s out there.  Here?  
                    Nada.  And I could say the same for 
                    you, my unemployed friend.

                                  KAT

                    that I m FIRED and b.) I am, oh I

                    Ulch, thanks for reminding me.  Last 
                    night I dreamt I was getting water 
                    boarded by Justin Beiber wearing an 
                    orange chiffon strapless. 

                                  KAT
                    They re not orange, they re 
                      cantaloupe and everyone else loves 
                    those bridesmaid dresses.

                                    REBECCA
                    They re lying.

                    we re gonna see you?

                    And don t roll your eyes at me.  
                    Marriage is supposed to be for the 
                    rest of your life, right?

                    So it can wait a year.  Life is 
                    short, Kat.  Let s go have 
                      adventures...  And if you postpone 
                    it, I can even be in the wedding.

                                    REBECCA
                    What s wrong with you?  You have a 
                    perfect excuse to avoid the melon 
                    dress.

                    Dancing in the sun at Rio s 
                    Carnival.  Think of a dream -- 
                    something you ve always wanted to 
                    do and we ll go do it.  Anything. 

                                  KAT
                    God... I don t know...

                                  ZOEY
                    Yes, you do.  Think.

                                  KAT
                    Um... well, I always wanted to walk 
                    though a cherry blossom tree 
                    orchard in Japan after I read 
                    Memoirs of a Geisha.

                                  ZOEY
                    Okay, why?

                                  KAT
                      Because... it seems like the 
                    perfect physical manifestation for 
                    what it feels like to be in love. 

                                    REBECCA
                    Wow.  I just threw up in my mouth 
                    more than a little.  Like Exorcist 
                    amounts.

                                  KAT
                    Gross.

                                  ZOEY
                    Your turn, Happy Pants.  One dream.                                                                                      9.


                                    REBECCA
                    Well, I wouldn t mind chucking 
                    tomatoes at people at that festival 
                    thing in Spain.

                                  ZOEY
                    Something meaningful.

                                    REBECCA
                    That is meaningful.  The only thing 
                    my mom knew how to cook growing up 
                    was spaghetti and Ragu -- wait, 
                    that s not fair, she could open a 
                    beer bottle...  So hurling tomatoes 
                    at strangers would release years of 
                      resentment.

                                  KAT
                    I support that.  What about you, 
                    Zo?  One we haven t heard.

                                  ZOEY
                    The Inca Trail.  I want to stand on 
                    the Temple of the Sun at Macchu 
                    Pichu.  Mom and Dad were never 
                    legally married but... she told 
                    me... right before she died... that 
                    they exchanged vows there, so...

      Kat reaches out.  Squeezes Zoey's hand.

                                  KAT
                    Your mom would be so proud that 
                    you re taking this trip.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Maybe Zoey's right, Kat.  You stay 
                    here and you get another job.  
                    Pretty soon that job s a career.  
                    And once you re married, there s  
                      offspring.  I say do it now.  While 
                    you can.

                                  KAT
                    Then why don t you go?

                                    REBECCA
                    Me?  No way.  I have a job.

                                  KAT
                    Reminder number two.  Thanks, girls.
                          (swigs her martini)
                    Well, there s no way I can go 
                    either.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    10.

                                  KAT (CONT'D)
                    Even if I wanted to, I m broke -- I 
                    mean, I just paid off my student 
                    loans.  And I m definitely not 
                    leaving Brian.  He s the only good 
                    thing I have left right now.  In 
                    fact, if you guys don't mind, I 
                    think I'll skip dinner and go home.
                          (stands)
                    Zo, I can t believe you re leaving.  
                    But have an amazing, debaucherous, 
                      life-changing, safe time.  I m gonna 
                    miss you so much.  I love you. 

      Kisses, hugs Zoey.  Turns to Rebecca.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    And I ll see you, later.
                          (off Rebecca's lewd gesture)
                    Why do the good ones always leave?

      And Kat s out.

                                  ZOEY
                          (getting up)
                    I should go, too.  Big day tomorrow.  
                          (squishing Rebecca's face)
                    I know sentimental moments make you 
                    writhe, so I ll make it quick.  I m 
                    gonna miss you too, you little bitch.

                                    REBECCA
                    I know.

      They hug.  Even Rebecca's fighting the tears.  Zoey goes.  
      Rebecca sits alone for a second.  The bartender approaches.

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    You don t serve spaghetti here, do 
                    you?


      Looks like it smells like beer.  Just a few people.  A band s 
      doing a sound check.  Zoey enters as they finish a song.  She 
      claps wildly.  ELAN (29), the hot guy at the mic, squints 
      into the darkness, sees her and curtsies.


      Rebecca's quietly flipping through a stack of mail as she 
      enters.  A breeze blows through her hair.  Breeze?  She looks 
      up and frowns.  Her window s wide open.  

      She takes a step towards it and freezes as she hears 
      something clatter to the ground in her bedroom.

                                  TALL GUY (O.S.)
                    Watch it!

      Rebecca's eyes go wide, but she s tough.  She grabs pepper 
      spray from her purse and edges toward her bedroom.  Sees two 
      men going through her stuff. 

      Holy shit.  Not that tough.  She hurries back toward the 
      front door...  

                                  TALL GUY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I m checking the living room again.

      Not gonna make it.  Rebecca ducks into a closet right before 
      Tall Guy emerges from the bedroom.

                                  OTHER GUY (O.S.)
                    It s not here, man.

                                  TALL GUY   
                    Keep looking.

      Here comes THE OTHER GUY.

                                  OTHER GUY 
                    We ve looked everywhere.  What if 
                    she has it on her?

                                  TALL GUY    
                    Well then, she's got to come home 
                      sometime...

      ON REBECCA: huddled in her closet.  Who the hell are these 
      guys?  Suddenly, KNOCK, KNOCK.  From the hallway:                                                                                      13.


                                  SECURITY TOM (O.S.)
                    Miss Stone?  It s Tom, security.  I 
                    forgot I had a package for you at 
                    the front desk.  

      Bad guys share a look.  

                                  OTHER GUY
                          (whispers)
                    Wonder if that s it.

      Tall guy gives him a shut up gesture.

                                  OTHER GUY (CONT D)
                          (mouths)
                    We should get it and find out.

      JOIN REBECCA'S POV through the thin crack between the closet 
      door and the wall.  Tall guy thinks.  Shakes his head.  

                                  TALL GUY
                    No.  Messy.  We ll come back later.

      The men slip out the window and down the fire escape.  

      IN THE CLOSET, Rebecca sits trembling.  KNOCK, KNOCK.  She 
      starts.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Miss Stone?

      She slowly pushes open the closet door with a shaky hand.  
      Apartment s empty.  Goes to the window and looks out.  
      They re gone.  

      Opens the front door.  SECURITY TOM smiles at her.

                                  SECURITY TOM
                    Sorry  bout that.  Hate to bother 
                    you.  Here ya go.

      Holds out a small package -- about the size of a glasses case.  
      Rebecca just looks at it, still stunned.

                                  SECURITY TOM (CONT D)
                    You okay?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yeah.  Sorry.  Just tired.  Thanks, 
                    Tom.

      Fakes a smile, takes the package, shuts the door.  But the 
      anxiety seeps back into her eyes as she turns the package 
      over and over in her hands...                                                                                    14.



      Kat bursts through the door, tripping over Brian s shoes.  

                                  KAT
                    Ouch!  

      BRIAN (30ish) hurries out from the bedroom.  He's cute and 
      charming in a non-threatening way.  The perfect nice guy for 
      the perfect nice girl.

                                  BRIAN
                    You okay?

                                  KAT
                    Ah, fudgesickle, that hurts.

                                  BRIAN
                    I love it when you talk dirty.

      She throws down her stuff and falls into his arms.

                                  KAT
                    Ohmigod, I m so happy to see you.  
                    This is officially the suckiest day 
                    ever. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Everyone gets fired at some point.

                                  KAT
                    Laid off.  Like that s better.

                                  BRIAN
                    Oh, honey.

                                  KAT
                    God, what s my mom gonna say?

                                  BRIAN
                    Don t worry about her.  How are you?  

                                  KAT

                    Statement Knits for Fall.  Sweaters 
                    can t talk, Brian!  I m never gonna 
                    be Fran Lebowitz.

                                  BRIAN
                    Poor thing.  Why aren t you drunk?  
                    Aren t you supposed to be out with 
                    your friends?                                                                                      15.


                                  KAT
                    I just wanted to be with you.
                          (hugs him again)
                    Tell me it s gonna be okay.  That 
                    it s not too late to start my career 
                    over, and that the important thing 
                    is we re getting married.  Right?

                                  BRIAN
                    Yes.  It really is okay.  And don t 
                    worry, my job s secure.  We ll be 
                    fine until you get another one.  
                          (kisses her)
                    Now.  Seriously, let s go get you 
                    some alcohol.  

                                  KAT
                    Wait.  I wanna show you something 
                    first.  Today didn t completely suck.  
                    I picked up my wedding dress.  And I 
                    know, it s bad luck to see the bride, 
                    blah blah... but I just want to show 
                    it to you.  It ll cheer me up.

      She runs into the bedroom, whips open the closet door and 
      smiles.  There it is.  Her wedding gown.  Fluffy, white and 
      huge.  She pulls it out.

      And there s a naked chick hiding behind it.

      And there goes her smile...

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Popcorn explosion number five-
                    hundred and seven.


      Knock, knock.  Zoey opens the door.  Finds Kat on her 
      doorstep.  Toothbrush in hand.  You watch Kat break down, and 
      as she explains what happened we hear:

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    This time... I m definitely going 
                    to the damn party.

      Zoey hugs Kat and is about to shut the door when...

      The elevator doors open across the hall to reveal Rebecca.  
      Standing there with a suitcase.  


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    16.


                                        ACT TWO


      Kat, Zoey and Rebecca throw their spankin  new backpacks onto 
      the security conveyor.  (Note: Kat wears an old NY ballcap.)

                                    REBECCA
                    God, I m regressing -- I haven t 
                    had a backpack since college.  What 
                    am I doing? 

                                  KAT
                    I know, I got the you re-crazy-you-
                      can t-just-leave-for-a year-it s-
                      irrational speech from, let s see, 14 
                    different people?  Mom, Dad, Brian--  

                                  ZOEY
                    Brian s not allowed to weigh in.

                                  KAT
                    His argument was he made a mistake, 
                    but I m about to make a bigger one.

                                  ZOEY
                    Naked closet girl isn t a mistake.  
                    It s not like he broke your 
                    favorite mug--

                                    REBECCA
                          (miming the order in the air)
                    Slavery, witch hunts, Brian.

                                  KAT
                    I know.  I hate him.  I do.  I just 
                    don t know if this is the answer.  
                      Everything in me is screaming to 
                    stay here, get another job, forgive 
                    Brian--

                                  ZOEY
                    That girl s hoo-hah touched your 
                    wedding dress, Kat!

                                  KAT
                    I know!

                                  ZOEY
                    Okay, you re making a vow, right 
                    now.  Think of what you would 
                    normally do, then do the opposite.                                                                                    17.


                                  KAT
                    Normally do, then do the opposite.  
                    Okay.  Good.  Done.

                                  X-RAY ATTENDANT
                    Does one of you have liquid 
                      containers over 3 ounces?

      Kat freezes, like she s sincerely guilty of being a drug mule. 

                                  KAT
                    Me.  I do.  I m sorry.  That s me.  
                    I m so sorry.  You wanna search me?

                                    REBECCA
                          (looks to Zoey)
                    Got a little ground to cover.


      ON KAT in a little pool of light.  Face in a travel book. 
      Wearing an old NY ballcap.  The rest of the plane is dark. 

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    People call Australia Oz.  And I 
                    guess it is -- this wild and 
                    forgotten adventureland at the 
                    bottom of the world.  You ve got 
                    your happy, fuzzy things -- 
                      kangaroos, koalas -- which are like 
                    the munchkins.  Then all the 
                    venomous crap that ll kill you like 
                    the flying monkeys.  I could go on 
                    all night with this... and 
                      unfortunately, I probably will...  

      PAN PAST Kat to find ZOEY.  Dead asleep.  Snoring like mad. 

      CONTINUE PANNING to see Zoey's head is propped on Rebecca's 
      shoulder, leaving a neat little puddle of drool.  Rebecca's eyes 
      are closed too.  But as an attendant walks by, they fly open.

                                    REBECCA
                    Could I get a scotch please.  Ice.

                                  KAT
                    You re awake.

                                    REBECCA
                    Can t believe this flight is 22 hours.

                                  KAT
                    Is it mean to say, I m glad you 
                    have insomnia, too?                                                                                    18.


                                    REBECCA
                    It s not that I can t sleep.  It s 
                    that sometimes I choose not to.

      Attendant sets down her scotch.

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    Thanks.  What should I drink to?

                                  KAT
                    Rebecca.  Why are you here?

                                    REBECCA
                    Not a traditional toast, but okay.
                          (swigs, then)
                    I told you at Zoey s... what I said 
                    at the bar to you -- I guess I 
                    convinced myself.  

                                  KAT
                    Don t think my faculties are 
                      compromised due to lack of sleep.

                                    REBECCA
                    It s the truth.  That and what 
                    Sleeping Drooly said -- life is 
                    short.  I guess it hit me.  

                                  KAT
                    I can see how something as new and 
                    profound as  life is short  would 
                    rattle you to the bone.

                                    REBECCA
                    Believe me or not.  I m here, right?  

      The look on her face says there s more but Kat lets it go.

                                  KAT
                    Thank, God.

      They have a moment then Rebecca downs her scotch and removes 
      Zoey's head from her shoulder like it s kryptonite.

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    If Australia s Oz, guess that makes 
                    us Dorothy and her crew.  Think 
                    it s fair to say Rebecca needs a 
                    tad more heart.  And I could 
                      definitely use some courage.  And 
                    Zoey, well... what is Zoey?  You 
                    get a perfectly good analogy going 
                    and your friends have to go and be 
                    too complex...                                                                                        19.


      Zoey s head flops onto Kat's shoulder now.  Mouth open. 

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Most of the time, anyway...


      A luggage turnstile spins.  Kat and Zoey have their packs but  
      Rebecca doesn t.  Nobody else waits.  The conveyor s empty.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Great.  I hate the traveling part 
                    of traveling.


                                  KAT
                    No!  This isn t right.  I called 
                    two days ago.  They said it d be no 
                    problem to move up the reservation--

                                  HOTEL CONCIERGE
                    I m so sorry, but it was cancelled 
                    by the credit card holder this 
                    morning.  There s nothing we can do.                                                                                    20.


                                  KAT
                          (starting to panic)
                    There s gotta be a mistake.  Lemme 
                    see that--

      Kat reaches across the reception counter, grabs the computer 
      from the HOTEL CONCIERGE and swivels it toward her.

                                  HOTEL CONCIERGE
                    Miss, please, let go. 

                                    REBECCA
                    Kat, Kat, it s okay.  Let go, baby. 

      Rebecca pulls her off.   

                                  KAT
                    How could he do this to me?

                                    REBECCA
                    Don t worry.  We ll figure 
                    something out.

                                  ZOEY
                    I know!  We can go to the Farmstay 
                      I originally booked.
                          (off both friends, unsure)
                    It s a real working farm.  They ll 
                    probably have sheep and other 
                    charming little animals.  It ll be 
                    awesome!

      Beat.  And then it s Rebecca who lunges across the counter 
      and grabs the computer.   

                                    REBECCA
                    How could he do this to me?!

                                  HOTEL CONCIERGE
                    Security!

                                  ZOEY
                          (pulling Rebecca off)
                    Trust me, it s gonna be heaven.


      Rustic, but cozy.  Kat brushes her teeth over a sink in the 
      corner while Rebecca pulls off her shoes.  Zoey enters.

                                  ZOEY
                    You guys, there s an outhouse out 
                    there.  Isn t that cute?

                                    REBECCA
                    Adorable.  They sell Depends in 
                      Australia?

      Zoey throws her pack on her bed, pulls out a framed photo and 
      sets it next to her bed.  ANGLE ON IT: A beautiful, young 
      woman beside a waterfall.

                                  KAT
                    God, your mom was gorgeous.  How 
                    come I haven t seen that picture?

                                  ZOEY
                    I found it last Christmas in a box 
                    of her stuff.  The back says she was 
                    17.  That s when she travelled -- 
                    before she even met my dad. 

                                  KAT
                    Where was it taken?

                                  ZOEY
                    I don t know... but I ve got a year 
                    to find it...

                                    REBECCA
                          (looking out the window)
                    Nothing like a sky fulla black gunk 
                    to make me feel right at home.                                                                                    22.


                                  ZOEY
                    Think of it as a really big 
                    campfire.

                                    REBECCA
                    Until we re engulfed in flames.

                                  KAT
                    Don t worry.  I ll keep an eye out.  
                    You know I m not going to sleep...


      ON KAT, snoring like a buzz saw.  ON ZOEY, also dead asleep.  

      ON REBECCA, staring at the ceiling.  She sighs, slips out of 
      bed and tiptoes outside...


      CLOSE ON KAT.  Sleeping blissfully.  She giggles as if being 
      tickled.  PULL BACK to see a few fat roaches nesting in her hair.  

                                    REBECCA
                    What re you giggling about?
                          (flopping over)
                    You having a dirty dream-- Ahh!

      Rebecca jumps outta bed.  Zoey and Kat's eyes fly open.

                        KATZOEY
      What?  What is it?What s happening?!

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    Roaches!  

                                  KAT
                    Where?!

                                  ZOEY
                    In your hair!

      Kat screams, shaking her hair out.  The roaches scatter.

                                    REBECCA
                    Guess we found the charming little 
                    animals.


      Boat s a mess.  Guys are perfect.  They pull the girls aboard.

                                  KAT
                    Thank you, thank you so much.  I 
                    don t know what we would ve done if 
                    you hadn t come by.

                                    REBECCA
                    Died.  
                          (looking at the boat)
                    Is this thing going to hold?                                                                                    30.

                    No need for flattery.  You had us 
                    at Ahoy.

                    I know.  It s stupid.  The water s, 
                    like, 90 degrees.  I have poor 
                      circulation.

                                  MAX
                    Take your suit off.

                    Excuse me?

                                  MAX
                    You can get hypothermia in warm 
                    water, too.  We ve got to get you 
                    dry.  

      A laid-back surfer, GREGORY hands out some towels. 

                                    GREGORY
                    He s right.  Get naked.  We ll turn 
                    around.

      Zoey and Kat drop trow.  But Rebecca hesitates.

                                    REBECCA
                    We have a cozy bed of roaches just 
                    waiting to warm us up.  So if you 
                    could get us home, that d be great.

                                  MAX
                    Where s home?

                                  KAT
                    Sugarcane farm in Mossman.

                                  MAX
                    No can do.  It ll be dark in less 
                    than an hour.  You ll have to stay 
                    the night at Tent City.

                                  KAT
                    What s Tent City?                                                                                    31.



      Everyone shoved together, dripping wet.  Gregory s tossing 
      two coins back and forth between his hands. 

                                    GREGORY
                    Two-ups.  You flip two pennies in 
                    the air then guess how they re 
                    gonna land.  It s a betting game.

                                  ZOEY
                    We don t have any cash.

                                    GREGORY
                    No need.  We play for Supercat.  
                    Loser drinks.

                                  ZOEY
                    I don t drink much.

                                    GREGORY
                          (grins)
                    Then you better win.


      Max.  Kat.  In a two person tent.

                                  MAX
                    You re soaked.

                                  KAT
                    Are you going to suggest I get 
                    naked again to avoid hypothermia?

                                  MAX
                    Not unless you want to.
                          (grins, then:)
                    Why are you here, Kat?                                                                                    36.


                                  KAT
                          (embarrassed)
                    You invited me.  To lay down.  Said 
                    I was an egg.

                                  MAX
                    No.  I mean on this trip.  Taking a 
                    year off s a big deal.

                                  KAT
                    I told you.  I got fired and my 
                    fianc  s a beak.  

                                  MAX
                    Berk.

                                  KAT
                    Yes.

                                  MAX
                    Still.  Most people would just stay 
                    on the treadmill.  Do what s 
                    expected.

                                  KAT
                    I ve been doing what s expected my 
                    whole life and I still found a 
                    naked chick hiding behind my 
                    wedding dress.

                                  MAX
                    Then to change now is brave.

                                  KAT
                    I m so not brave.  My mom says I m 
                    running away and I probably am.  
                    Who knows if this is the right 
                    decision.  I screw up often.

                                  MAX
                    You re hard on yourself.
                          (moves closer)
                    I hate break-ups.  They mess with 
                    your head.  Make you doubt 
                    yourself.  You may not be feeling 
                    the most confident right now, but 
                    you ve got to know that you re an 
                    amazing, beautiful person... all 
                    the way down to your broken heart.  
                    I hope it doesn t take you long to 
                    see what I see.

      Kat stares at him.  Deer in the headlights.                                                                                    37.


                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    The vow.  What was it?  Think about 
                    what I would normally do, then do 
                    the opposite.

      They have sex.


      CLOSE ON: TWO PENNIES FLYING IN THE AIR.  Pull back to see 
      Rebecca's the one throwing -- total pro.  Zoey s drunk, almost 
      maniacal.  The room erupts as the coins fall.

                                    REBECCA
                    Odds!

                                    GREGORY
                    That s four.  One more and you odd 
                    out.  Spinner throws again!

                                  ZOEY
                    Come in Spinner!

                                  OTHER SURFER
                    You only say that when you get a 
                    new tosser.

                                  ZOEY
                    You said tosser!  Who wants to take 
                    me on for Tails?

                                  OTHER GUY
                    I ll do.  Heads.

                                    REBECCA
                    Kip s away!

      She flips the coins off a small piece of wood.  

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    Heads!  I win!

                                  ZOEY
                    Which means I lose.  Bummer.
                          (downs her drink)
                    All gone!

                                    REBECCA
                    Easy, frat boy.

                                    GREGORY
                    Crap.  No more Supercat.

      Gregory shakes an empty jug.  Everyone grows quiet...                                                                                    38.


                                  ZOEY
                    Then we ll just have to think of 
                    something more interesting to play 
                    for...

      Everyone yells again.  Except Rebecca who has one discerning 
      eye on Zoey... who is definitely not herself...


      Almost dawn.  Post hot, sweet, rain-pelting-on-tent sex.

                                  MAX
                    Yeah, I d definitely say you re 
                    brave. 
                          (off Kat shaking her head, 
                              embarrassed)
                    Come on, when you did that thing?  
                    With your leg?  At least daring.  
                          (more head shaking)
                      Inventive?  Skilled?

      She laughs.  He kisses her.  Suddenly, outside, someone 
      shrieks.  They poke their heads out to see Zoey running bare-
      butted down the beach.  Kat pulls on some clothes, joins 
      Rebecca and the others.

                                  KAT
                    What happened?

                                    REBECCA
                    We ran out of Supercat.

      Everyone laughs, watching Zoey run, just a naked silhouette 
      in the moonlight.  She suddenly cuts toward the waves. 

                                    GREGORY
                    Hey, wouldn t go in there at night!  
                    There s all kinds of things in that 
                    water you can t see in the dark.

      Zoey turns around, covering herself...

                                  ZOEY
                    You just wanna see my nakedness!

                                    GREGORY
                    You re right!  
                          (off Zoey, edging closer)
                      Seriously, don t.  It s dangerous.

                                  ZOEY
                          (dunks a toe in)
                    But the water s so warm--                                                                                    39.


                                    REBECCA
                    He s right, Zoey.  Don t be stupid.

      Zoey grins.  Loving the game.  Suddenly she leaps into the 
      water, screaming with delight.  A few people laugh with her.

                                  KAT
                    Zoey, come on.  That s enough!

                                  ZOEY
                    It s so beautiful!

      But then, she lets out a short scream.  A few laugh, assuming 
      she s kidding.  But the screaming doesn t stop.  Everyone 
      sprints down the beach, leaps into the surf and drags Zoey 
      onto the beach. 

                                  ZOEY (CONT D)
                    Ah!  God!  My leg!

                                  MAX
                          (inspecting Zoey)
                    She s been stung.

                                    REBECCA
                    Damnit, Zoey, we told you to get out.

                                  KAT
                    Is it a jellyfish?  The box kind?

                                  MAX
                          (avoids answering; to Zoey)
                    Don t move.  It ll make it worse.
                          (to Kat)
                    Go in my tent.  There s a first aid 
                    kit and my shaving kit in the duffle 
                    bag -- grab both.  Hurry.  Go.

      Zoey winces in pain.  Kat takes off running--


      Kat jumps inside.  Digs frantically in Max's bag.  Finds... 
      her NY BALLCAP?  Wha???  

      She shakes her head, confused.  No time now.  She tucks the 
      ball cap under her arm and continues to dig through the bag 
      until she finds the kits, then runs outside.  


      Rebecca and Kat watch as Owiso dabs a poultice on Zoey s leg.   

                                    REBECCA
                          (whispers to Kat)
                    For all we know that mess could be 
                    poisoning her.

                                  OWISO
                    It s the root of a peanut tree and 
                    it s getting the poison out.
                          (lays a leaf on top)
                    And this, is a snakevine leaf.

                                    REBECCA
                    What, no eye of newt?

                                  OWISO
                          (smiles, then to Zoey)
                    You were stung by a blue bottle.  
                    Not deadly, but hurts like a bitch.  

                                  KAT
                    Where d you learn all this?

                                  OWISO
                    My parents, grandparents.  Aboriginal 
                      medicine s been around for thousands 
                    of years.  No cancer cures, but I can 
                    fix a jelly sting.  

      Zoey reacts -- from what he says, not what he s doing.

                                  OWISO (CONT D)
                    So leave that on for a half hour 
                    and you ll be good as new.

      Owiso leaves.

                                  KAT
                    Okay, so promise me you re not 
                    gonna be running around like a 
                    silly little freak this whole year.

                                  ZOEY
                    What d you mean?  I m always silly 
                    and freaky.  I went skinny dipping 
                    and got stung.  Not that big a deal.                                                                                    45.


                                  KAT
                    Not just that.  I mean, we ve been 
                    a little sidetracked, but I wanted 
                    to talk to you about the diving 
                    thing.      

                                    REBECCA
                    You didn t even see her drink last 
                    night.  It was like Britney and 
                    Lindsay had a baby.

                                  ZOEY
                    You guys, come on, you know me -- 
                    I m a free-spirit.

                                    REBECCA
                    There s free-spirited and there s 
                    reckless.  We do know you, Zo.  
                    You re acting different, I don t 
                    know... desperate.

                                  KAT
                    She s right.  If we re off, say so, 
                    but something s going on with you.

      Beat.  Zoey looks away, thinking... 

                                  ZOEY
                    I... I had a doctor s appointment 
                    the day before we left New York.  I 
                    blew it off.

                      REBECCAKAT
      What?  Zoey--Oh god, you okay?

                                  ZOEY (CONT D)
                    Yeah, no, nothing s wrong-- I mean, 
                    I don t know.  I was supposed to 
                    get a test to check for BRCA 1 and 
                    2... I couldn t do it...  

                                  KAT
                    Isn t that the...

                                  ZOEY
                    Genetic marker.  For cancer.  Yes.
                          (beat; no one breathes)
                    You know my mom got sick when she 
                    was 30.  I m 29.
                          (fighting the tears)
                    I just wanna see everything -- do 
                      everything...                                                                                    46.


                                    REBECCA
                    Zoey.  I can t pretend to know how 
                    you feel, but here s a thought that 
                    keeps me sane... you aren t your mom.

                                  ZOEY
                    It wasn t just my mom.  It was her 
                    mom.  And her sister -- every woman 
                    in my goddamn family has got the 
                    stupid c-word in their lady 
                    business!  

                                  KAT
                    That doesn t mean you will.  And if 
                    there s a test you should take, then 
                    let s get it done.

                                  ZOEY
                    I can t--

                                  KAT
                    Zoey--

                                  ZOEY
                    It will change me!
                          (tense beat)
                    I don t worry about things.  I 
                    never have... until... 
                          (fighting tears)
                    The other day I went jogging and I 
                    got this little pain in my side and 
                      I thought: that s it.  Tumor.  
                    Every little twinge I get -- elbow, 
                    leg, whatever -- it means my uterus 
                    is eroding.
                          (beat, off Rebecca and Kat)
                    See.  You already have that awkward 
                          oh-my-god-she-has-a-disease face.

                                  KAT
                    No, we don t.  Do we?

                                    REBECCA
                    You re not sick, Zo.  You re not.

                                  ZOEY
                    You re saying that because you want 
                    to believe it.  
                          (wipes her eyes fiercely)
                    Look, point is, I could get hit by 
                    a bus tomorrow -- stung by a 
                    jellyfish -- or yeah, get cancer.  
                    So I m goin  to the buffet.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    47.

                                  ZOEY (CONT'D)
                    And I m gonna shove as much in my 
                    mouth as I can.  What s wrong with 
                    that? 

                                  KAT
                          (inside voice comes out)
                    You re Dorothy.

                                  ZOEY
                    What?

                                  KAT
                    Dorothy.  From the Wizard of Oz.  
                    Okay.  See, you can search and 
                    search -- live as hard as you want -- 
                    in full technicolor -- but you 
                    shouldn t do it just to run away 
                    from something.  At some point, Zo, 
                    you gotta figure out what you re 
                    running to. 

      Quiet.  Until Owiso interrupts.  This time, carrying 
      Rebecca's missing pack.

                                    REBECCA
                    My bag.  Airport finally pulled it 
                    out.  Miracle.

      Rebecca pounces, immediately opens it and digs around.  We 
      see her find the PACKAGE, then shove it back inside.

                                  OWISO
                    Actually, I made a call.  Drove out 
                    there last night.  I know a guy. 

      Owiso grins and leaves.  Rebecca stares after him, dumfounded.


      Kat flits around, packing up her stuff.  Brian grovels.  

                                  BRIAN
                    You can t imagine what it s been 
                    like since you left.  I hate not 
                    seeing those little date labels you 
                    make for all the food when I open 
                    the fridge.  I hate that I can 
                    always find my razor by the sink.  
                    I hate that the bed s half empty 
                    and the closet s half empty and--

                                  KAT
                    --I m sure Little Miss Naked could 
                    take care of the last two things.

                                  BRIAN
                    Kat, I flew to Australia.  Doesn t 
                    that mean something?  

      But Kat maintains a poker face.  Brian stops her, pulls her in.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Look.  I screwed up bad, I did.  
                    But I need you.  And you need me.  
                    Please.  Give me another chance.

      And as Brian takes the engagement ring from his pocket and 
      slips it back on Kat's finger... we PULL BACK: 


      The taxi rumbles away then suddenly stops.  Rebecca jumps 
      out, runs back and hands a small piece of paper to Owiso.                                                                                      56.


                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    But you can get closer..

      As she runs back to the taxi, he unfolds it and smiles.  It's 
      her email address.        

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    With every risk you take.

      And as the taxi disappears in the distance, see another car 
      pull out from a side street and start to follow it...

      laid back anymore.
