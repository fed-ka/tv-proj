                                  SAM'S VOICE
                    I got him.

      And now the down town forest of skyscrapers fills the screen 
      and we change trajectory, swooping between the towers,  
      turning down West Fifth Street towards Grand Avenue.

      The swooping aerial comes to rest. It's a HIGH DEFINITION 
      photo, not live, an oblique angle of West Fifth Street 30 
      feet off the ground.  A beat, then a section of the street 
      shimmers with static as the TRAFFIC CAM image is stitched 
      into the photo.  And now we have a live view of the street.

      CHANDLER, early 20s, walking away from camera wearing a GREEN

      SPECIAL AGENT KENSI LO, late 20s.  Confident, headstrong, 
        intelligent. Exotic good looks, but dressed down to blend 
      into the crowd as she talks discreetly into her wrist mike...

                                  KENSI
                    Welcome to the party, Mace.

                    Stay on him.

      KENSI'S POV across the street, Chandler walking steadily, not 
      looking left or right.  Kensi's POV shifts to a man walking 
      twenty yards behind Chandler...

                      Repositioning Sam, back to me at 
                    the intersection.

      SPECIAL AGENT SAM HANNA shoots her a discreet look.  Sam's in 
      his 40s, with the wisdom that only experience teaches.  Not 
      as fast as he used to be, but still as good for knowing it.

                                  SAM
                    Ease up Kensi, you don't wanna get 
                    there first.

      An SUV with tinted windows begins to slow.  Suddenly - BAM! 
      BAM! BAM! BAM! The shop front behind Chandler explodes in a 
      SHOWER OF GLASS.

      Sam instantly turns, reaching for his SIG as Kensi talks 
      urgently into her mike --

                                  KENSI
                    Shots fired! Shots fired! 
                      'Blackbird' is under fire!

                    Working on it.

      BACK ON THE STREET

      Kensi and Sam sprinting, closing the distance on Chandler and 
      at the same time identify where the shots are coming from.

      BAM! BAM! Chandler ducks as the window of a parked CAR 
      explodes behind him.  He's running hard, changes direction, 
      darting out into the speeding traffic.

      Sam tries to follow, is momentarily checked by the traffic.

      BAM! BAM! BAM! The shots hit a speeding SEDAN'S windscreen.  
      It side-swipes a PICK-UP which swerves out of control towards 
      Chandler.  It flashes by him, the front fender CLIPPING THE 
      BRIEFCASE, which bursts open...

      HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS spill from the briefcase, blowing high 
      into the air.  Chandler keeps running.

      Behind Kensi a chain reaction as the speeding traffic tries 
      to avoid the accident.  SQUEALING BRAKES and HONKING HORNS as 
      a second PICK-UP sideswipes a VAN, which veers off the road 
      towards the pavement.

      SAM'S POV as the Van demolishes a LITTER BIN and spears 
      straight for Kensi.

                                  SAM
                          (into his mike)
                    Kensi! Behind you!

      ON KENSI - already half turning to the sound of screeching 
      metal.  She dives for cover a split second before the out of 
      control Van mounts the pavement and slams into a shop wall.

      Sam sprints through traffic and swirling bank notes, 
      scrambles around the van, finds Kensi shaken in a doorway.

                                  KENSI
                    Get Chandler!

      Sam quickly looks down the street.  Traffic chaos.  Drivers.  
        Pedestrians. Onlookers.  

                                  SAM

                    We need a visual, Sam.

      Sam pushes through a growing crowd of ONLOOKERS, scanning the 
      street.  No Chandler. Too late.

                                  SAM
                    That's a negative, Mace.

                          (sound of phone hung up)
                    Gone.

      Tony hangs up the phone.  Troubled.  Something's up with 
      Ziva.  He can feel it.

      RESUME ZIVA in the coffee shop.  

      CAMERA MOVE REVEALS MICHAEL RIVKIN (established Episode 114 
      'Last Man Standing') sitting opposite Ziva.  Straight off the 
      cover of Vogue Men.  Ziva uncomfortable.

                                  RIVKIN
                    DiNozzo?

                                  ZIVA
                    I do not want to lie to him, 
                    Michael.

                                  RIVKIN
                    A small lie. 
                          (then)

                    What else does my father send?

      He reaches out, touches her arm.

                                  RIVKIN
                    Me.

      Rivkin smiles disarmingly.  

      And off Ziva, hard to read...

      CAMERA SHIFT reveals SPECIAL AGENT CALLEN, late 30s, sitting 
      on a PARK BENCH overlooking the beach.  Casually dressed.  
      Relaxed.  But his eyes betraying his restless mind.

                                  CALLEN
                    You still building that boat in 
                    your basement?

                                  GIBBS' VOICE 
                    Yep.

      Gibbs leans into FRAME, sharing the bench with Callen.

                                  CALLEN
                    Same one?

                                  GIBBS
                    No.  Another one.

                                  CALLEN
                    Two boats. Three wives.

                                  GIBBS
                    Four.

      A flicker of a smile from Callen.  Nearby, a FAMILY GROUP is 
      playing a game of BOLO.  Fun.  Laughter.  Callen and Gibbs 
      watch them in silence for a beat.

                                  CALLEN
                    You see Mace?

                                  GIBBS
                    Yeah. I saw her.

                                  CALLEN
                    You got a long memory.

                                  GIBBS
                    For some things.

                                  CALLEN
                    You two would make a great couple if 
                    you didn't hate each other so much.  

                                  GIBBS
                    How have you been, G?

                                  CALLEN
                    Not so bad.  Maybe even bordering 
                    on good some days.  

                                  GIBBS
                    Still looking?      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  31.


                                  CALLEN
                    Still looking.
                          (beat)
                    Reason we're not having this 
                      conversation in a bar?

                                  GIBBS
                    Ten AM.

                                  CALLEN
                    Wouldn't have stopped us back then.

      Callen suddenly leans close, lowers his voice.

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    How's your Russian?

                                  GIBBS
                    Rusty.

                                  CALLEN
                    Name's Alexi.

      A YOUNG WOMAN, 20s, attractive, approaches.  Sees Callen, a 
      smile of recognition forming on her lips.

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                          (in Russian)
                    I don't want to hear any more 
                    excuses.  You tell him he has until 
                    the end of the week. 

                                  GIBBS
                          (in Russian)
                    What happens at the end of the 
                    week, Alexi?

                                  CALLEN
                          (in Russian)
                    If he doesn't pay what he owes then 
                    I will find him and I will --

      Callen abruptly stops as he 'sees' her for the first time. 

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    It was a good game, but the striker 
                    should never have been red carded. 

      He smiles at the Young Woman who quickly moves on.  Callen 
      watches her a moment. Perhaps with a hint of regret.

                                  GIBBS
                    Should have told me you were 
                      undercover.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  32.


                                  CALLEN
                    Only for her. 
                          (indicating a building)
                    She lives across the street from 
                    me.  Just arrived from St 
                      Petersburg.  Lonely. If she thinks 
                    I'm Russian Mafia she won't try to 
                    make friends.

                                  GIBBS
                    Wouldn't hurt for you to have some 
                    female company.

                                  CALLEN
                    This from the man who's been 
                    married too many times.

      Callen's cell rings. Macy. He kills the call. Looks at Gibbs.

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    Sometimes you plan them for weeks.  
                    Sometimes you get a day.

                                  GIBBS
                    Another one of Macy's rushed ops.

                                  CALLEN

                    Miss the old days. You taught me a lot.  
                    Saved my ass that time in Serbia.

                                  GIBBS
                    Moscow.

                                  CALLEN
                    My ass didn't need saving in Moscow.

                                  GIBBS
                    Yes, it did.

                                  CALLEN
                    No, that was Petrov.  Petrov's ass 
                    always needed saving.

      Underneath the fun, something more serious. More poignant. 

                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    Some are worth saving more than others.

      Callen holds Gibbs' look for a moment.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  33.


                                  CALLEN (CONT D)
                    Worked with some good people.  

                                  GIBBS
                    Made some good friends.

                                  CALLEN
                    Lost a few.
                          (moving on)
                    How's Fornell?

                                  GIBBS
                    Same.

                                  CALLEN
                    He owes me twenty bucks.

                                  GIBBS
                    Fornell owes everyone twenty bucks.

      A wry smile from Callen.  His cell rings again.  He flicks it 
      off.  Time's up.  They stand.  A handshake turns into a hug.

                                  CALLEN
                    Next time, we park in a bar.  Not 
                    bolo in a park.  Okay?

      Gibbs nods.  Callen sets off.  Gibbs watches for a long 
      moment, then turns and walks off in the opposite direction. 


      Callen, walking towards the diner, glances casually down the 
      street.  A CAR HORN HONKS.  Once.  

      And on cue, Callen transforms himself, slowing his stride, 
      hunching his shoulders, dropping his dead down a little, eyes 
      flashing left and right...No longer Callen but Frank 
      Maitland.  He pushes through the door and enters the diner.


      A web of SCAFFOLDING clinging to the front of a multi-story 
      apartment building.  A TRUCK half-loaded with scaffolding is 
      parked in front of the building.

      The NCIS SEDAN turns into the street, pulls up outside the 
      building.  Tony and Ziva get out, cross to the truck, Tony 
      trying to appear as if he knows what he's talking about.

                                  TONY
                    Looks like a six-cylinder diesel...

                                  ZIVA
                    Twin turbo four-cylinder.

                                  TONY
                    Right.  

      Moving towards the front of the truck. 

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    Battery should be somewhere here...

                                  ZIVA
                    Here.

      Ziva is peering up into the engine bay behind the cabin.

                                  TONY
                    There.

                                  ZIVA
                      Twenty-four volt battery.  New.  

      They exchange a look.

                                  STEPHANO'S VOICE
                    Looking for something?

      They both turn to see two men, STEPHANO and BENJI KASS, both 
      in their 30s, exiting the building carrying BOXES OF SCAFFOLD 
      FIXTURES.  Tony steps forward.  Ziva continues looking around.

                                  TONY
                          (badging them)
                    Special Agent Tony DiNozzo, NCIS.  
                    Guess you'd be the Kass boys...This 
                    your rig?

                                  STEPHANO
                    What if it is?      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  49.


                                  ZIVA
                    Tony.

      Tony joins Ziva at a small dumpster.  She pulls on a latex 
      glove, reaches into the dumpster, pulls out a SHOE.

                                  ZIVA (CONT'D)
                      Chandler's left shoe was missing. 

      An exchanged look between the two, then they turn towards the 
      Kass brothers -- Ziva's hand reaching for her SIG.  Stephano 
      suddenly breaks left, Benji darts back into the building.

      Ziva's SIG is in her hand in one fluid motion.

                                  ZIVA (CONT D)
                    Freeze!

      But Stephano has put the truck between the two of them.  As 
      Tony bolts after Benji, Ziva sprints to cut off Stephano.

      They meet at the front of the truck, Ziva getting there a 
      split second before Stephano.  She snaps out her fist, brings 
      him down. Stephano rolls over to find himself looking down 
      the barrel of Ziva's Sig.

                                  ZIVA (CONT D)
                    I'm guessing Stephano.

      Stephano grimaces.


      Benji barrels up the stairs and onto the roof.  He leaps down  
      onto the partially erected scaffolding.

      Tony reaches the top of the stairs, hears Benji on the 
        scaffolding, charges to the roof's edge and begins to climb 
      down after him.  It creaks in protest and a couple of 
      unsecured pieces go clattering to the ground below. 

      Benji keeps climbing down.  The scaffolding wobbles, more 
      pieces coming away.  Suddenly a large piece of the 
      scaffolding falls away, trapping Benji on a now highly 
      unstable section.  He freezes, aware of the danger.  Tony 
      scrambles down, stops, catching his breath as he realizes 
      Benji's predicament.  

                                  TONY
                    Oops.  Looks like the guys that 
                    erected the scaffolding got a little 
                    careless.  Oh, wait.  That'd be you. 

      He shakes the section he's standing on. It barely rattles.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  50.


                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    I'm good.  You, not so much.

      Benji glares at him.  Moves.  The whole section wobbles, 
      several more pieces fall away.  Benji grips a support rail as 
      the scaffolding creaks ominously beneath him.  Tony sees a 
      nasty welt running across the back of Benji's hand.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    Nasty rope burn.

                                  BENJI
                    You've gotta help me get off this.

                                  TONY
                    You get it when you strung up 
                    Private Chandler?

      Benji glares at him.

                                  BENJI
                    The whole thing is going to come 
                    down.

                                  TONY
                    How much did they pay you?

                                  BENJI
                    Come on man, please...

                                  TONY
                    That what Chandler said when he saw 
                    the jumper leads?

      Tony works himself into a closer position, reaches out.  
      Benji releases his grip, stretches for Tony's hand.  Too far.  
      The shift in his weight causes the scaffolding to lurch 
      again.  Benji stifles a scream.  

                                  TONY (CONT'D)
                    How much?

                                  BENJI
                    Nothing, okay?  We owed him one.  
                    He called us, asked us to pick 
                    Chandler up at the airport.  
                    Emailed us his flight and photo. 

                                  TONY
                    What information was he after?

                                  BENJI
                    I dunno, honest!  He just wanted to 
                    find out if he'd talked to anyone.      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  51.


                                  TONY
                    Had he?

                                  BENJI
                    No.

                                  TONY
                    Your friend's name.

                                  BENJI
                    You don't know what he's like.  
                    He'll kill me.

      The scaffolding creaks loudly.  Tony pulls out his HANDCUFFS.

                                  TONY
                    Don't worry, the fall will kill you 
                    before he does.
                          (beat)
                    Try again.

      Benji stretches out his hand.  Tony leans out, readies the 
      cuffs.

                                  TONY (CONT D)
                    I think it's about to go.  What did 
                    you say his name is?

                                  BENJI
                    Liam!  His name is Liam!

      Tony lunges, snaps one link of the cuff onto Benji's wrist.  
      Benji jumps, the scaffolding creaks and groans, shedding more 
      pieces.  As Benji grabs at the scaffolding, Tony snaps the 
      second link onto the frame, pulls Benji up to safety.

                                  TONY
                    Last name?

                                  BENJI
                    Just Liam.

      Close, but not close enough.

      Off Tony knowing they've drawn a blank...

                                                                      PHOOF TO BLACK.

                                      END OF ACT THREE      Episode 135 [01/15/09]                                  52.
