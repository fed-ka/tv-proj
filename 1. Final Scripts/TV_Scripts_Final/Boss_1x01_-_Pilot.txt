                                                                      King Lear, 1.1      FADE IN ON a single continuous shot.An empty chair, square 
    on. Behind it, a wide open, dilapidated space.

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.)
                    Take a seat.
                          (beat)
                    Please.

      A man enters frame, sits. THOMAS KANE (mid 50s). Continuing 
    the same shot, we stay tight on him throughout.

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.) (CONT D)
                          (beat)
                    It s called LewyBody. Abnormal 
                      microscopic amounts of protein 
                    depositing themselves in the nerve 
                    cells of your cerebral cortex and 
                    substantia nigra, here... 

      Stay on Kane. We hear the flap of an x-ray being held up. 

                                  DOCTOR  (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    ... and here, destroying them over 
                    time, atrophying the frontal and 
                    temporal lobes. It's rare. It's not 
                    Alzheimer s, it's not Parkinson's, 
                    but like them, degenerative 
                      progression is slow, irreversible 
                    and there is no known cure. 

      Nothing gives on Kane s face. Another flap, the x-rays are 
    put away. A shuffle. Silence.

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    First, your higher mental functions 
                    will deteriorate. Orientation, 
                    reasoning, intelligence, insight. 
                    Your behavior and personality will 
                    change, lack of inhibition, 
                    confusion, lack of concern about 
                    your surroundings. Your speech will 
                    become unusual, nonsensical at 
                    times, with unconscious repetition, 
                    loss of words. You will experience 
                    increasingly severe visual 
                    hallucinations, paranoia, 
                    delusions. Depression is common. 
                    Anxiety more so. Later, as the 
                    disease advances, you will see 
                    dystonic postures, muscle rigidity, 
                    tremors, loss of language, memory, 
                    prominent grasp and sucking 
                    reflexes. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    2.

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    Eventually you will not be able to 
                    carry out simple daily tasks. The 
                    damage to your temporal lobe so 
                    severe that you will have 
                    difficulty with balance, your body 
                    movement reduced drastically with 
                      fluctuating levels of 
                    unconsciousness lasting days to 
                    weeks... until death.

                                  KANE
                    How long?

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.)
                    It s hard to say. Three, maybe five 
                    years.

                                  KANE
                    I can t shake. 

                                  DOCTOR  (O.C.)
                    We can try to mitigate some of that 
                    with antiparkinsoniandrugs but... 

                                  KANE
                    What drugs?

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.)
                    They may acutely worsen the 
                      hallucinations and delusions, 
                      precipitating psychosis.

                                  KANE
                    What drugs?

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.)
                          (beat)
                    L-DOPA. Combined with Rivastigmine, 
                    maybe haloperidol for the 
                      neuroleptic side. We ll have to see 
                    what works for you. 

      Silence. Kane, still immutable. 

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    You'll need legal advice. Advance 
                      directives, power of attorney, 
                      determining the course of certain 
                    ethical decisions. If, for 
                    instance, your behavior becomes 
                      aggressive, dangerous to yourself 
                    and to others, do you want to be 
                    medicated or restrained? 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    3.

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    When your sensory functions 
                      deteriorate are we to rectify 
                    through surgery, or leave be? You 
                    need to make these decisions now, 
                    while you still can. Eventually you 
                    will need twenty four hour care, 
                    somewhere comfortable where your 
                    needs can be met. I assume this 
                    could be at home?

    The last word,  home , triggers something inside Kane. 

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    You might want to talk to your 
                    family?

    The flicker gone, Kane s face resumes its cold control...

                                  DOCTOR (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    There are also support groups... 
                    elder care...

                                  KANE
                          (interrupting)
                    Thank you, Doctor.

      Continuing the same shot, pulling out wider: Kane rises and 
      waits as the DOCTOR, (female, 40s) collects her things. His 
      gaze turns to the derelict factory floor around them.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    20,000 men worked right here, in 
                    this place, slaughtering hundreds 
                    of thousands of hogs and cattle a 
                    day...  Life, with all its cares 
                    and its terrors, is no such great 
                    thing after all ... Laborer or hog.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Sinclair.

                                  KANE
                    Yes.

      Continuing the same shot:We follow them to the door, pushed 
      open to the blinding light and out to... 

    ... The desolate expanse of the STOCKYARD INDUSTRIAL PARK, 
    the famed meat packing Yardsof a bygone era now pocked with 
      ghost ridden factories, long emptied warehouses and a handful 
    of struggling, smaller industrial projects. Windswept rail 
      tracks to the south and east. Smatterings of South Side slum 
      housing in the far distance. The place could not be more 
      complete in its isolation.                                                                                    4.


    We follow them to a parked SUV. The Doctor unlocks it. Kane 
      holds the door for her, could be out of politeness, but it s 
      a beat too long for that.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Thank you for coming all the way 
                    out here. I hope you understand.

                                  DOCTOR
                      I understand.

    He closes the door and she takes off. Watching her go, he 
      reaches for his cell, speed dials a number...

                                  KANE  (INTO PHONE)
                    I m ready.

    He puts the phone away, and now alone, he relents suddenly, 
    his mask finally dropping, his breaths quickening, he has to 
      loosen his tie. He reaches out to steady himself against the 
      nearest wall, the wave not abating he sinks lost for air, 
      sliding down the distinctive red bricks of the old Union 
      Stockyards Bank. He wills himself to control his breathing...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                      Bareheaded... bareheaded...  
                    shoveling, wrecking... 
                      bareheaded...

    He straightens, regaining control. A town car approaches. He 
      begins toward it and we follow, andcontinuing the same shot,
    we climb into the rear with him. We stay tight on him 
      throughout as the car takes off. Around him the buildings 
      shift and change as streets swish by. He sits in silence. The 
      driver, not revealed. 

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                      Bareheaded... shoveling, wrecking, 
                    planning, building, breaking, 
                      rebuilding... 
                          (beat)
                    What have you done? What have you 
                    done?

      A sound begins to grow, drawing closer, a CROWD CHEERING, 
      clapping...

      Staying on Kane,we see people outside the car windows 
      rushing about their work, equipment in hand, two way radios, 
      clipboards, a frenzy of activity. The car comes to a stop, 
      Kane takes a moment, composes himself then gets out and 
      continuing the same shot,we get out with him.                                                                                     5.


    The roar of the crowd is now loud, just beyond. A handful of 
      people rush up to him, make up touches, adjustments to his 
      collar, brushes to his shoulders. KITTY O'NEIL(Female mid 
      30s) marches with them, next to KANE, toward a set of high 
      scaffolding...

                                  KITTY
                    They re ready. Turnout about six 
                    hundred. Podium is stage right. 
                    You ll walk across. Friendlies
                    behind for the cameras and packing 
                    the first 3 rows in the pit. Hayes, 
                    Rosen, Cullen and his wife sit 
                    stage left. In that order...

    ... continuing the same shot,the others peel away, only 
      Kitty remains, marching with Kane through the scaffolding to 
    the bottom of makeshift stairs, and up toward an opening, the 
      crowd s noise now deafeningly close...

                                  KITTY (CONT D)
                    ... When you announce him, she ll 
                    come first, then Cullen. Kenny 
                    Williams is doing your intro.

    ... Kitty stops on the very last possible step, Kane 
      continues alone, but suddenly stops too, looking back at her.

                                  KANE
                          (searching)
                      Williams... what s the-

                                  KITTY
                    Stealth Bomber.

      With that he s up and out, taking us with him in thesame 
      continuous shotonto a stage, a sea of people suddenly 
      stretching out before us on the grass of MILLENNIUM PARK.

                                  KENNY WILLIAMS
                    ... the mayor of this great city... 
                    Tom Kane.

      Cheers erupt from the crowd, the front three rows with huge 
      vigor, the rest not as enthusiastic but following suit. 
      Banners flutter, all uniformly and simply reading:  McCALL
      CULLEN. GOVERNOR.  We follow Kane across stage toward the 
      podium, as he smiles, waves, points at various people in the 
      crowd. Reaching WHITE SOX GENERAL MANAGER KENNY WILLIAMS with 
      a big handshake and hug, he takes to the microphone...                                                                                    6.

                    Thank you Kenny.
                            (leaninginto mic, 
                              conspiratorially)
                    Who reyou after for left-hand bat? 

      Laughter from the crowd. WILLIAMS, now taking his seat on 
      stage next to the other DIGNITARIES gives a big laugh...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Cliff Lee?
                            (gesturingat the crowd)
                    Oh come on. Don t mind them. Just 
                    tell me.

      WILLIAMS waves him off. Kane smiles...

                    Never see him coming... Stealth 
                    Bomb...

      Another burst of cheers. Kane waits for them to calm. His 
      eyes find the monitors showing the TV feeds, and continuing 
    the same shot,so do we, seeing how they make the event look 
    ten times larger and now slowly they push in past the crowd, 
      tightening in on Kane. He waits for the right moment. The 
      angles are good, the crowd ready...

                    180 years ago, a 29 year old man 
                    arrived in town by boat. His name 
                    was Jeremiah Porter. A Presbyterian 
                    minister. What he found was a 
                    settlement numbering no more than 
                    300 people, the majority of whom 
                    were soldiers stationed at Fort 
                    Dearborn, along with some French 
                    trappers, and pockets of 
                      PotowotomieIndians. But among the 
                    lot of them, vice was rampant. 
                      Corruption, an accepted way of 
                    life. Prostitution, boozing, horse 
                    racing, cards, dice and all forms 
                    of gambling were common 
                    occupations. Not far from here, on 
                    the Southwest corner of Clark and 
                    Lake, on a patch of land that was 
                    at the time, nothing more than a 
                    prairie bog, Jeremiah Porter set

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Through dead of night and stifling 
                    heat of summer day, he worked with 
                      volunteers, by hand, by horse and 
                    by tool and by winter, they had 
                    built themselves a church, the 
                    first in the city. The First 
                    Presbyterian Church of Chicago. And 
                    it was only then that Reverend 
                    Porter's work truly began. 
                      Eradicating gambling, stamping out 
                    vice, raising arms against 
                      corruption. Today the first 
                    Presbyterian stands on a new site 
                    on the South Side at 64th and 
                      Kimbark.And despite having 
                    weathered many troubles over the 
                    years, the congregation still holds 
                    daily services, 180 years after 
                    Reverend Porter first began his 
                    crusade. It stands as a testament 
                    to an abiding truth about the 
                    nature of this great city. This, 
                    most American of all cities. That, 
                    always, its darkest elements, have 
                    given rise to its greatest 
                    crusaders of light. Its grafters 
                    and gamblers, sinners and 
                      corrupters, mob bosses and crooked 
                    aldermen have been met face on by 
                    those who could not, would not, be 
                    corrupted, with their cleansing, 
                      galvanizing force for good. These 
                    men, and women, seized the 
                      imagination of their time and did 
                    right by the people to bring about 
                    better tomorrows. Men like Jeremiah 
                    Porter. Men of moral muscle, men of 
                    backbone and unimpeachable 
                    integrity. Men who bareheaded, 
                    shoveling, wrecking, planning, 
                    building, breaking and rebuilding, 
                    made this city, and this state, 
                    what it is today. My friend...
                          (beat, points for effect)
                    ... Governor McCall Cullen is such 
                    a man. 

    The front three rows know when to play their part, they 
      explode into cheers, banners waving wildly. Kane looks toward 
      Cullen. Cullen smiles back, wide, but also leans slightly 
      toward an AIDE behind him and through the fixed smile...

                                  CULLEN
                    What the fuck is this?                                                                                    8.

                          (over the cheers)
                    And with your help, Mac is going 
                    back to Springfield!...

    The crowd s cheers double and are sustained. Cullen and his 
      wife are up, making their way to Kane...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    ... Again and again and again!

      Kane, Cullen, his wife. Hugs. Smiles. Arms aloft. Cheers.

    End of the shot. FADE OUT.

      EXT. PROPOSED O HARE EXPANSION SITE, BENSENVILLE - DAY

    In the near distance we see the main buildings of O Hare
      Airport, the runway clotted with waiting planes. Before it, a 
      vast construction site, fenced in. Caterpillar excavators, 
      articulated trucks and concrete mixers all lie idle between 
      piles of rubble and dirt. It s clear the place has not seen 
    any construction activity in a while. A tent offers shelter 
      from the beating sun. 

                                  GARZA (O.S.) (IN SPANISH)
                    What do you think?

      Inside the tent. Two construction workers, GARZA and ORTIZ 
    sit amongst boxes and untouched equipment. Around them, at 
      least a dozen other workers also laze, waiting...

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                    If we work, we work. If not...

      Ortiz is carefully constructing himself a very elaborate 
      burrito, reaching into small containers he s laid our before 
    him for carnitas, onions, cilantro... Garza watches him.

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    It s ten AM.

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                    So.

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    So what are you going to eat for 
                    lunch?

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                    Lunch.                                                                                    9.


                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    What s this?

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                    This... is breakfast...

      Ortiz carefully reseals all his containers first, cleans his 
      fingers then grabbing his burrito with relish, takes a big 
      bite. His eyes light up. His cheeks puffed...

                                  ORTIZ (CONT D) (IN SPANISH)
                    ... number two.

                                  FOREMAN (O.C.)
                    Alright everyone listen up.

      They spin around. Everyone in the tent hopping to attention 
    at the approaching FOREMAN.

                                  FOREMAN (CONT D)
                    Pick up your things. Salva, 
                    Miguelito, bring the 360 trackhoes
                    and the hydro. We re working 
                    today...
                          (turns, pointing)
                    ... over there.

    We see, across the way, the large tombstone-covered grassy 
      stretch of the St. JohannesCemetery, butting right into the 
      shadow of the airport. Ortiz swallows his mouthful. Looks 
      from the graveyard to his burrito...

                                  CHIEF EXHUMER (O.S.)
                    We ve got one thousand three 
                    hundred and seventy two plots to 
                    get through. And for every single 
                    one of them I want the same thing.


      EXT. ST. JOHANNES CEMETERY, BENSENVILLE - DAY

    The construction crew, gathered at the center of the 
      cemetery, listen to a man covered head to toe in white rubber 
      protective wear, the CHIEF EXHUMER, talking to their Foreman.

                                  CHIEF EXHUMER
                    Six inches. That s half a shovel 
                    length. Yes? Not an inch more. When 
                    your guys hit that depth they stop. 
                    Stop. And they call one of my guys 
                    over. Most of these plots are pine 
                    boxed, so you ll feel it. Like a 
                    thud, a thump. Yup?                                                                                    10.


                                  FOREMAN
                    Yup.

                                  CHIEF EXHUMER
                    I don t know who the hell cooked up 
                    this contract division bull shit, 
                    but we can t touch the top soil and 
                    you can t touch the coffins so we 
                    have to work this together.

                                  FOREMAN
                    We ll make it work.

                                  CHIEF EXHUMER
                          (showing a document)
                    Alright, you sign this... 
                          (the Foreman signs)
                    I sign here... ok, let s go.

    CUT TO:The bucket head of an excavator churning up the earth 
      before a tombstone. Around it, other excavators are doing the 
      same. GARZA, ORTIZ and other workers stand by with shovels. 
      ORTIZ nods toward the sour faced EXHUMER TEAM waiting a way 
      off, all covered in their head to toe white rubber getups.

                                  ORTIZ (IN SPANISH)
                          (to Garza)
                    Hey, hey... check it out... 
                      Ghostbusters.

    He cracks himself up laughing. 

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    Not funny, man.

      Garza stares at the upturning grave. Ortiz quietens, crosses 
      himself.

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH) (CONT D) 
                    We re up.

      They jump in, their shovels taking to the loosened earth.


      INT. 5TH FLOOR, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - DAY

    The city s century-old seat of power - the Office of the 
      Mayor. Kane exits the elevator and makes his way through the 
      open floor buzzing with the mayhem of city management. On the 
      walls all around hang portraits of the old Bosses - Cermak, 
      Kelly, Kennelly, Daley, Washington. 

      Kitty O Neil walks with Kane, cell phone glued to her ear...                                                                                    11.

                    No dinner. He s out at eight PM. 
                    Sharp... What kind of gifts?

      Spotting them, a JUNIOR AIDE rushes up and hands Kitty a 
      batch of notes. She sifts through them as they continue to 
      walk, lands on one in particular...

                                  KITTY (INTO PHONE) (CONT D) 
                    Yup... ma am, ma am, I ll have to 
                    call you back. 
                          (hangsup, to Kane)
                    Cullen. Called 3 times since we 
                    left. 

                                  KANE
                    Get him. And tell Stone to come in.

      Kane enters his personal office, a sanctuary of calm away 
      from the bustle on the floor. He removes his jacket. His desk 
      phone rings. He hits the speaker button.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Put him through.

      Click.

                                  JUNIOR AIDE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Governor, you re on with the Mayor.

                    Mac.

    The office door opens. IRA STONE (male, 50s) enters quietly, 
      lean and fit, Kane s  grey suit  (senior advisor) is grey in 
      demeanor, greyer in moral outlook.

                                  CULLEN (ON THE PHONE)
                    Hell of a speech.

                    Thanks.

      INT. CAR, INTERSTATE 55 - DAY

      Cullen sitting in the back, holds an iPadshowing the 
      Tribune s latest front page - a picture of himself on stage 
    at the rally earlier, arms victoriously aloft.                                                                                     12.


    The headline reads:  CRUSADER OF LIGHT . The sub:  Moral 
      muscle, backbone and unimpeachable integrity .

                    Good...

      Cullen tosses the iPadto his Aide. He couldn t be angrier 
      about it. Hates even more having to pretend he s not with 
      Kane.

                                  CULLEN (CONT D)
                    We re going out wide for the next 
                    two weeks. Back in town a couple

                    What s the temperature?

                                  CULLEN
                    It s a toxic shit storm. Anywhere 
                    across the fifty where there s a 
                    vote. Two-, sometimes three-,

                    Yeah, Walsh. Walsh, I know how to 
                    take. It s not the main event I m

                                  KANE
                    Primary s yours, Mac. You ve got 
                    Cook County, you don t need 
                    anything else.

                                  CULLEN
                    Yes. Of course. Thank you, Tom.                                                                                    13.


      Long beat. Close on Kane... Close on Cullen... neither man

                    Is this about O Hare?

                                  CULLEN
                    Don t fucking ask questions. This 
                    isn t some fucking learning moment.

                    Fucking moron. 

    In Kane s office.

                                  KANE
                    How s the kid looking?

                                  STONE
                    He ll be here in an hour.

                                  KANE
                    Is he ready? 

                                  STONE
                    He s ready. His attacks on Cullen 
                    are gaining some serious balls. 

                                  KANE
                    Anyone putting him up to it?

                                  STONE
                    No. He either really gives a shit 
                    or he s the most ambitious son of a 
                    bitch I ve ever seen.                                                                                     14.


                                  KANE
                    Personals.

                                  STONE
                    Solid. He s straight. Goes to 
                    church. Family. Kids. Camera loves 
                    him. He s young but the game has 
                    changed, no one cares about that 
                    anymore.

      Kane leans back in his chair. Swivels to look out the window.

                                  KANE
                    Stoney... I need five minutes. 

                                  STONE
                          (rising)
                    Sure.

                                  KANE
                    Can you tell them out there? No 
                    calls.

      Stone exits, leaving Kane alone. He is still, lost in 
      thought. Slowly he turns to face his desk, reaches for his 
      phone, thinks better of it, reaches into his pocket for his 
      cell phone and slowly dials a number...


      EXT. ANEX BUILDING, CALVARY EPISCOPAL CHURCH, CHICAGO - DAY

    The church stands tall in the background. Before it, a low, 
      squat anex building carries a sign:  Calvary Episcopal 
      Church. Free Clinic .We hear a phone ringing...


      INT. ANEX BUILDING, CALVARY EPISCOPAL CHURCH, CHICAGO - DAY

      A small waiting area packed with the old and young, Black, 
      White and Hispanic, seated and standing. All around, there 
    are signs showing the understood transaction of the set up - 
    the health care is free because God loves you. 

      A simple folding table operates as receiving desk. A phone on 
    it is ringing... A VOLUNTEER seated at the desk ignores it, 
      focused on some form. A young woman appears from behind a set 
    of curtains, leans in next to the VOLUNTEER, finger running 
      down an impossibly long waiting list. Her name is ALICE KANE 
      (female, 30). No fuss, small, simply attired, she seems tired 
    but gives the sense of unending determination...

                                  CLINIC PATIENT
                          (calling out)
                    Sixty two.                                                                                    15.


      Alice looks up...

                                  CLINIC PATIENT (CONT D)
                    We re at sixty two.

                                  ALICE
                          (calling out)
                    Sixty two.

                                  CLINIC PATIENT
                    Yup, let s move it along.

      Alice crosses off the number on the list. The reception desk 
      Volunteer finally answers the ringing phone.

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER (INTO PHONE)
                    Clinic... Just a moment...
                          (motioning to the 
                            receiver)
                    Alice...

      Aliceshakes her head: not now.

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Can I take a message?

      Alice pulls the curtain and waits for patient sixty two to 
      step forward. A frail looking old man (black, mid 70s) 
      approaches, helped by a young man (black, early 20s).

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Can I come in with him?

                                  ALICE
                    Are you family?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    I m his nephew.

    She nods them in. They walk slowly past rows of curtained 
      cubicles. All full. Medical. Dental. Eyes. Second hand 
      equipment, donations, stacks of generic drugs. Alice holds a 
      clipboard, filling out a questionnaire as they walk...

                                  ALICE
                    What s your name, sir?

                                  OLD MAN
                    Morrison. Edward Morrison.

                                  ALICE
                    Date of birth?                                                                                    16.


                                  OLD MAN
                    Two Five. Oh Five. Three Five.

                                  ALICE
                    Address?

    The old man has trouble talking, wheezing as he draws breath. 
    The younger man, seeing his uncle s discomfort, takes over.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    He lives in Englewood. Do you need 
                    more than that?

                                  ALICE
                    A zip?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    60621.

      They reach an empty cubicle. 

                                  ALICE
                    Mr. Morrison just take a seat here. 
                          (tothe Young Man)
                    Medicaid? PCA?CHIP?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    No.

                                  ALICE
                    What s your name?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Darius. D. He has emphysema, he s 
                    been on inhalers but he s started 
                    to feel a lot of pain...

                                  ALICE
                    A doctor will be with you in a 
                    minute.

      DARIUS  cell starts to ring. He reaches into his pocket. 
      Checks the number. Doesn t answer it. It stops. A beat. Alice 
      continues filling out the form. DARIUS  cell rings again...

                                  DARIUS
                    Ma am? Can I take this?

    She looks at him: what do you want me to do?

                                  DARIUS (CONT D)
                    It s private.                                                                                    17.


                                  ALICE
                          (pointing at the equipment 
                          and medication)
                    I can t leave you in here alone.

      DARIUS is momentarily stunned by such a direct insinuation, 
    but he has to take the call. He ducks out, just to the other 
      side of the curtain, answers the phone... 

                                  DARIUS (INTO PHONE)
                    Yeah... I can t right now... Later, 
                    yeah... How much...

    As he talks Alice glances at him through the curtain. His 
      muscular bare arms and neck are covered in tattoos. His 
      jewelry is minimal but if it s real, it s expensive. Suddenly 
    he catches her staring at him. She immediately looks away. 

                                  DARIUS  (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    ... Alright... Later.

    He hangs up. Enters the cubicle. His eyes on her, hers glued 
    to the form, scribbling. There s a long silence. She looks 
    up, connects directly with him again. Hold. 

      A doctor in overalls swishes in, breaking the discomfort...

                                  CLINIC DOCTOR
                    OK. What have we here?

      Alice hands the doctor the form and leaves. On the other side 
    of the curtain, the front desk volunteer intercepts her...

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER
                    It was your dad.

                                  ALICE
                    My dad?

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER
                    On the phone?

                                  ALICE
                          (beat)
                    What did he say?

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER
                    Just to call him.

      Alice is silent. The Volunteer shrugs, hands her the note: 
       Dad. 555-1212 . Close on Alice, staring at it, shaken.                                                                                    18.


      EXT. NOBLE SQUARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 24TH WARD - DAY

    Low brick buildings. An empty school playground. A sign above 
    the main entrance:  Noble Square Elementary School .

                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                    Not long ago, financial shortages 
                    had placed Noble Square Elementary 
                    on a list of imminent school 
                      closings...


      INT. MAIN HALL, NOBLE SQUARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 24TH WARD - 
    DAY

      A handful of faculty hover expectantly at the entrance. The 
      place is full of kids, seated cross legged in rows on the 
      floor, buzzing with excitement. On the walls hang their art 
    and craft work and a large sign put up specially for this 
      occasion - vivid in its branding it reads: A Scientia School.

                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                    ... But through its partnership 
                    with Scientia, Noble Square s 
                    faculty, staff and students have 
                    improved this school to become one 
                    of the most successful in the city. 

      MEREDITH KANE (female, late 40s) enters. She s suited, 
      immaculately groomed, smiling, with a minimal entourage of 
      EXECUTIVES and an AIDE.  Press photographers move in, 
      clicking. A WBBM-TV local crew covers for TV. She shakes 
      faculty hands. A group of kids come up together and proffer 
      various hand made gifts. She crouches down to them.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Did you make this?
                          (a kid nods)
                    For me?
                          (anotherkid nods)
                    Well, thank you.

    She hugs them. They hug back. Cameras click away.

    CUT TO: The main hall. The adults clapping, children 
      excitedly following suit. Meredith at a podium...

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Grades are up. Attendance is up. 
                    Parents and students are satisfied.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Scientia, working with local 
                      government, provided the critical 
                      technology, textbooks, supplies, 
                      maintenance and financial planning  
                    required to help turn this school 
                    around. Today, right at this 
                    moment, Scientia specialists are at 
                    work at schools across Chicago. 
                          (turningto one of the 
                          execs in her entourage)
                    Scientia CEO, Mike Bosovic, is a 
                    Noble Square alumnus himself, so I 
                    know how saving this particular 
                    school has been of personal 
                    importance to him. 

      CLAPPING. BOSOVIC (male, 60s) humbly nods... 

    CUT TO:A WBBM-TV REPORTER wrapping up to camera. In the 
      background Meredith sits with kids, reading to them...

                                  WBBM-TV REPORTER
                    Mrs. Kane read with students, met 
                    the faculty and staff at Noble 
                    Square and is scheduled to continue 
                    meetings with Scientia staff, at 
                    their headquarters, later this 
                    afternoon.
                          (beat)
                    Ok... lets get some B-Roll.

    SAM MILLER (male, 30s) a Tribune reporter standing next to 
    the TV crew leans in toward them.

                                  MILLER
                    You guys want something with a bit 
                    more bite? 
                          (extending his hand)
                    Miller. Tribune.

                          (shaking his hand)
                    What do you have in mind?

    CUT TO:P.O.V.of the TV camera, from the back of the hall, 
      capturing the dilapidated and disintegrating back wall and 
      ceiling, clumsily covered by felt drapery and kids  collages. 

                                  WBBM-TV REPORTER (CONT D)
                            (whispering)
                    Get that... get all that... and 
                    swing it to her...                                                                                    20.


    The camera pans from the dilapidation to Meredith, where she 
      was, at the front of the hall, reading to the kids. 

      SCIENTIA EXECS notice it, murmur to themselves in discomfort. 
      MEREDITH S AIDE quietly approaches her and whispers in her 
      ear. She nods, still smiling at the kids and continues on as 
      though nothing was happening...

      Back of the hall, Miller, the Tribune man, smiles to himself, 
      impressed with her cool. 

    We hear the LOUD BEEPING of a VEHICLE REVERSING...


      EXT. ST. JOHANNES CEMETERY, BENSENVILLE - DAY

      A TRACKHOEbacks up BEEPING to the edge of a dug out grave. 
      Down inside it, two white-coated Exhumers hook straps wrapped 
      securely around a coffin to a hook on the trackhoe scrane 
    and climb out of the grave. The crane operator throws a lever 
    and the coffin starts to lift, mud and dirt clinging to it. 

      Garza and Ortiz stand by, shovels in hand, watching as the 
      coffin rises... upwards... past their faces... Suddenly there 
    is a loud shudder. The Exhumers motion to the crane operator. 
    He stops the lift. A crack. They bend to see the underneath 
    of the coffin, rotten and wet, starting to give, the remains 
      inside seeping out. Another crack. Its about to come apart. 
      Ortiz drops his shovel, scrambles down into the grave, under 
    the coffin, and reaching up, pushes on its underside, keeping 
    it intact...

                                  ORTIZ
                          (shouting)
                    Spin it around. Place it down.

    The crane head turns, guiding the coffin slowly down to the 
      side of the grave, Ortiz pushing up, holding it intact for as 
      long as he can. It comes to a rest, relatively in one piece, 
      finally revealing Ortiz from under it, covered in mud, 
      breathing hard. He rests for a moment against the hole s 
      side. Garza crouches down to give him a hand. 

                                  GARZA (IN SPANISH)
                    You OK?

      Ortiz reaches up. Their hands connect. Suddenly there s a 
      loud rumble. Ortiz slips, dropping down further into the 
      grave, disappearing from view. Garza scrambles to the edge, 
      looks down. The loosened earth is giving away fast, getting 
      swallowed into an expanding sinkhole, Ortiz sinking in it. He 
      grapples, trying to hold onto something. Garza reaches for 
      him. Shouts go up.                                                                                     21.


    As suddenly as it started, it stops. The mud and earth 
      settling into stillness. Ortiz buried waist deep but OK. His 
      eyes connect with Garza. Both breathe a sigh of relief. Then 
      something else - Garza s eyes focusing past the stuck Ortiz, 
    on something behind him. Ortiz twists as best as he can to 
      see, revealed, the facade of a wide and slanted stone wall 
      covered in heavily elaborate carvings - Native American of 
      sorts. And jutting out of the churned earth around it, bones, 
      skulls, tools... a tomahawk...

    CUT TO: Ortiz sits by a utility truck, hands and face still 
      covered in mud. Garza hands him a soft drink.

    He looks back toward the grave they were digging, now 
      swarming with perplexed Exhumers, then across to the front of 
    the cemetery where other white coats and a small team of 
      local law enforcement are establishing a safe perimeter...

      Sunk deep in a Lazyboy, a sports Tand shorts clinging

      CLOSE ON RUIZ, the receiver to his ear, slowly losing all 
      interest in the TV because of what he hears on the other end 
    of the line... he clicks the remote, turning the TV off...

      INT. 5TH FLOOR, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - DAY

      Elevator doors open to reveal ALEX ZAJAC (male, 40), 
      impeccably handsome. Kitty waits for him. They shake hands.

                                  ZAJAC (O.C.)
                    Because I believe in the role of 
                    government to do what the private 
                    sector cannot. To provide the

                    businesses to thrive...

    CUT TO:Inside Kane s private office. Kane at his desk. Stone 
    in his usual spot. Kane s phone buzzes. He answers it.

                    Yes.

                                  JUNIOR AIDE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Treasurer Zajac is here, sir.

      Zajac and Kitty enter. Zajac shakes hands with Kane. Then 
      with Stone.

    CUT TO:Close on Zajac, seated, mid speech...

                                  ZAJAC

                    I was born here, South Chicago, in 
                    the Bush. My father worked steel at 
                    E.C.Tin every day of his life. The 
                    only thing he ever expected from me 
                    was that I would never do the same. 
                    So I m sure you ve heard it before. 
                    Stanford undergrad.Law at Uof C. 
                    Straight to Holland and Dunn in the 
                    city. Call it the path of least 
                      resistance. One day I realized I 
                    could see the whole thing. Not just 
                    the steps I d taken to where I was, 
                    but every step from there on out as 
                    well. The rest of my life in its 
                    entirety. It made me feel 
                    miserable.

                                  ZAJAC (CONT'D)
                    So I left, took a job at the 
                    housing authority. I was 
                      overqualified and underpaid, but 
                    everything changed. My worst day 
                    was always better than my best in 
                    the private sector. From there I 
                    ran for State Treasurer. And I won. 
                    And every moment has been nothing 
                    but exhilarating since. Because 
                    everything I do, every decision I 
                    make, in a small, practical way, 
                    affects the lives of every citizen 
                    in this state. All 12,910,409 of 
                    them. And that matters.

      Kane slowly looks from Zajac to Kitty, then Stone.

                                  KANE
                    This fucking kid.

    He laughs. Zajac isn t sure how to react.

                    Come with me.


      EXT. ROOFTOP GARDEN, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - DAY

      Kane and Zajac walk along the grid-like paths that cut 
      through garden patches on the expansive roof of the classical 
      revival building. Around them sky scrapers shoot upward, 
      encasing them in. The sounds of the city beneath are loud and 
      insistent. Kitty and Stone hang back waiting at the roof top 
      door. Kane reaches for a basket of oranges, placed along the 
      path, throws one to Zajac and begins to peel his own...

                                  KANE
                    When Cermakwas mayor he d come up 
                    here almost every day. He was a 
                    Bohemian, an immigrant, working-
                    class. Like you, except he utterly 
                    lacked charisma. But he had a gift. 
                    He understood people. He was the 
                    first to force the Irish into 
                    sharing power with the other 
                    ethnicities. He called it his 
                     house for all peoples  and from 
                    here, he had an uninterrupted view 
                    of it. All fifty wards... 
                          (turns, pointing north)
                    North Side, Lincoln Square, the 
                    Germans...                                                                                     25.


    As Kane points, the sky scrapers in that section quietly 
      vanish and instead we see the old, low buildings that 
      populated the city 80 years ago. City sounds go mute leaving 
      only his voice. He points to a different section...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Northwest, Division and Ashland, 
                    your lot, the PoloniaTriangle. As 
                    well as the Czechs, the Jews... 

    He pivots and points to different sections, and one by one 
    the sky scrapers in each disappear, leaving only the old 
      city.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    ... West Side, Taylor and Grand, 
                    the Italians... South Side, the 
                    Blacks... And everywhere else and 
                    in between, the Irish...

    ... pivoting, pointing, sky scrapers vanishing, only the old 
      city remaining... until the tallest building standing is 
      theirs. We see it, square down from above, the 11 stories of 
      City Hall at the center of the city s web of power.

                    These were tribes. Each controlling 
                    their neighborhoods like fortress 
                    enclaves. They hated each other, 
                    fought, maimed, killed and rioted 
                    against each other. 

      Close on Kane, looking out, transported as he speaks, as if 
      heis standing there on top of the roof 80 years ago...

                    Cermacweaved a thread through the

                    forming the first truly dominant 
                    political force this country had 
                    seen. He did it because he 
                    understood something basic about 
                    all people. That they wantto be 
                    led. They want their disputes 
                    settled, their emergencies decided, 
                    their treaties negotiated, their 
                    jobs dispensed, their fears and 
                      attachments inspired, their 
                    mutinies punished, their loyalties 
                    rewarded. And in return, to those 
                    who lead them to all that they 
                    want, they give power. It s a 
                    covenant. Unspoken and elemental.

                    go for the whole thing?

                                  KANE
                    There are no degrees. This isn t 
                    precision surgery. You go after him 
                    because it s time to take him out.

                                  ZAJAC
                    His numbers are high. Only 3 weeks 
                    left until the primary.                                                                                     27.

                    It s an eternity. 3 days would be.

                                  ZAJAC
                    What about Walsh in the general?

                                  KANE
                    One step at a time.

      Beat. Zajac looks away, pondering the moment...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Don t tell me you want to think 
                    about it, because I know you don t.

      Zajac looks back at Kane. Beat. Then his arm slowly extends, 
      their hands grip and they shake. Kane takes him by the 
      shoulder, turning him to face out toward the re-appearing sky 
      scrapers that surround them once again.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Smile.

                                  ZAJAC
                          (through his smile)
                    Why?

                                  KANE
                    Sometimes it's necessary to let the 
                    other guy know you're coming.

      Wide on Kane and Zajac as they shake hands before the 
      multitudes of windows looking down on them.

      With Stone and Kitty.Spotting Kane and Zajac s handshake, 
      Stone motions to Kitty to look too. 

      Kane s Junior Aide comes rushing out the roof top door, face 
      ashen.

                                  KITTY (O.C.)
                    Sir?

      Kane turns from Zajac to see Kitty approaching in a hurry.

                                  KITTY (CONT D)
                    Something urgent.


      INT. KANE S OFFICE, 5TH FLOOR, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - DAY

      Kane, Stone, Kitty and Junior Aide watch a TV tuned to the 
      local news.                                                                                     28.


    On it, Alberto  Moco  Ruiz, changed hastily from his sports T
    and shorts into a flashy, ill-fitting suit, is being 
      interviewed in front of the St. JohannesCemetery. He holds a 
      muddied Tomahawk preciously in his hands. Garza and Ortiz are 
    in the background watching him...

                                  RUIZ (ON TV)
                    My company...

                          glance at camera)
                    ... the MocoConstruction Company, 
                    our job today was to clear the 
                    graves here at the, uh, cemetery. 
                    Some of my workmen were uh, uh, 
                    exhumingthis grave and that s how 
                    they came across it. Ostensively.

      Kane is a study in delaying explosive rage.

                    Who is that?

                    There seems to be a whole big site 
                    here, under the cemetery, and for 
                    all intensive purposes we believe 
                    it s an... old... Indian site of

      INT. DEPARTMENT OF NEUROLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MEDICAL 
      CENTER - DAY

      Head of neurology, DOCTOR ELLIHARRIS enters her consultation 
      room, a file in hand. We recognize her as Kane s doctor from 
    the opening scene. A patient sits, already waiting for her.                                                                                    29.


                                  DOCTOR HARRIS
                          (reading off the file)
                    Mr. Miller... Sorry to keep you 
                    waiting.

    The patient too we recognize - Sam Miller, the Tribune 
      reporter we met earlier covering Meredith Kane s photo-op
      school visit. Doctor Harris takes a seat behind her desk.

                                  DOCTOR HARRIS (CONT D)
                    Doctor Singhreferred you, but I m 
                    a little short here in my notes as 
                    to why.

      Silence, her eyes still scouring the file, waiting for him to 
      answer. But he doesn t. Finally, she looks up. Beat.

                                  MILLER
                    I d like to apologize. Dr. Singhis 
                    an old friend and I have grossly 
                      manipulated that friendship to get 
                    here to see you.

      Harris takes a moment. Rests the file on her table - go on.

                                  MILLER (CONT D)
                    I m a reporter, with the Chicago 
                    Tribune. I m doing a story, taking 
                    kind of a deep look... at Tom Kane.

      Miller pauses, gauging her bit by bit. Harris is still. 

                                  MILLER (CONT D)
                    I know he s been to see you. And 
                    given what you... specialize in, it 
                    seems that maybe there s 
                      information here that might be of 
                    serious interest to the public.

      Harris rises, moving swiftly for the door.

                                  MILLER (CONT D)
                    I know you are bound by 
                    confidentiality but -

                                  DOCTOR HARRIS
                    Thank you, Mr. Miller.

      Harris has the door open, waiting for him to leave. It is 
      absolutely clear that she is not going to even entertain 
      speaking another word. Miller stands, makes his way out.

                                  MILLER
                    If you change your mind...                                                                                    30.


      Harris does not speak. The moment Miller s out she closes the 
      door on him. She returns to her desk, collects Miller s file 
    and dumps it in the trash. When she sits again her eyes catch 
      something else on her desk. She collects it. A business card: 
    Sam Miller. Chicago Tribune.


      INT. KANE S OFFICE, 5TH FLOOR, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - DAY

      Kane and Stone seated. Kitty enters bringing in Alderman LALO
      MATA (male 50s-60s), political boss of the 30th ward and his 
      guy, HAIME (male 30s).

                                  MATA
                    Mr. Mayor.

      Mata shakes hands with Kane, motions toward Haime...

                    My nephew, Haime. Hope it's OK if 
                    he sits in. Thought he could learn 
                    a bit about the context of things.

                                  KANE
                    Take a seat.

    CUT TO:Kane at his desk. Mata before him. Stone and Haime, 
    on the couch. Kitty, by the door.

                                  MATA
                    It was a mistake. Tom, you know we 
                      appreciate, I appreciate everything 
                    that you have done... If this poca

                    moment to think about it he would 
                    not have rushed over there, with 
                    the cameras and... hijode that he 
                    is. And let me tell you, I knowhis 
                    mother...

      Mata searches for the hint of a break. None is forthcoming. 
    As he goes on, Kane rises, makes his way to the front of his 
      desk and sits on the edge, boring down into him...

                                  MATA (CONT D)
                    ... He s not the brightest. But he 
                    has his uses. Right? His guys are

                    Stop.

      Immediate silence. Kane keeps his eyes pinned on Mata.

      finally stands knocked out if his stupor, ready to do 
      something for his boss. But he stops. Mata s own hand is 
      aloft, struggling to balance against the excruciating pain, 
    but holding Haime back...

                                  MATA (IN SPANISH)
                    Sit, Haime...

      Kane, never turning his eyes away from Mata... 

                                  KANE
                    Pay attention, son. This right here 
                    is the context of things.

      Stone is inscrutable. Kitty carries a perverse animalistic 
      satisfaction at the political mauling going on.

      Outside. Angle on the working floor craning to hear the 
      continued muffled shouting coming from inside Kane s office.

      Suddenly his door slams open, Kane appears, face fuming, and 
      waits in the doorway forcing Mata and Haime to cross so close 
    to him as they leave that they can feel his breath. 

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                          (still apoplectic)
                    THANK YOU FOR COMING!

    As they hurry away, Kane watches them go, making sure they 
      continue to hear every syllable of his (now hoarse) shouting. 

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                      Somebody... get me... some WATER!

    He turns back into his office slamming the door with such 
      force it bounces off its frame and swings slowly open again. 
      Junior Aide comes rushing in with a bottle. Kane drinks, 
      breaths still hard, but calm.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Next.

                    Moretti s getting them.                                                                                    34.


      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, SCIENTIA OFFICES, CHICAGO - DAY

      Various angles on Scientia s offices. The height of modern 
      opulence in corporate decor meets posters of smiling children 
    in warm school playgrounds, science labs, sport centers...

                                  SCIENTIA EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
                    ... bymandating annual testing of 
                    children in Grades 3 to 8, 
                    providing tutoring for children in 
                    persistently failing schools,...

      Wide on a glass-walled conference room, dark inside except 
    for the flicker of a Powerpointpresentation.

                                  SCIENTIA EXECUTIVE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... and setting a twelve-year 
                    timetable for closing chronic gaps 
                    in student achievement, we believe 
                    we can meet these goals.

      Inside the conference room.Lights go up. At a conference 
      table, Scientia executives sit facing Meredith Kane and her 
      Aide. The Executive giving the presentation sits. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Thank you.

      Meredith looks across at Mike Bosovic, CEO of Scientia.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    I wonder if I could have a private 
                    word.

      Beat. The room begins to empty, execs and assistants all 
      clearing out. Meredith nods to her own Aide who also leaves. 
      Bosovic and Meredith are alone. He smiles awkwardly.

                                  BOSOVIC
                    I had my start in your father s 
                    administration. Transportation 
                    Authority. So I m honored to be 
                    working with you now... and your 
                    husband.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Mr. Bosovic, I hope it s OK if we 
                    bypass idle chatter... 

                                  BOSOVIC
                    Yes, of course.                                                                                    35.


                                  MEREDITH
                    The conditions in that school today 
                    were a disgrace.

                                  BOSOVIC
                          (beat)
                    I know. I apologize. We try, but 
                    sometimes we come across odd forms 
                    of intransigence, particularly from 
                    faculty. I assure you that our goal 
                    always is to strive for what is 
                    best for the children.

                                  MEREDITH
                    My husband s administration has 
                    allocated 2 billion dollars over 5 
                    years to be dispensed to joint 
                      public-private enterprises targeted 
                    expressly at servicing the city s 
                    schools. Companies like Scientia. 
                    But there are others, as you well 
                    know. He ushered the funds through 
                    the City Council with no public 
                    hearings, and he put my hand on the 
                    spigot. Please do not mistake my 
                    concern for today s mishap as a 
                    tell for a bleeding heart. We are 
                    interdependent. What reflects 
                    poorly on you, reflects poorly on 
                    me and on the mayor. There is a 
                    minimum standard across all your 
                    company s line of services that 
                    will be enough to keep prurient 
                    eyes away. Please meet it. I do not 
                    care how you do what you do. I care 
                    about how it looks.
                          (beat)
                    Yes?

                                  BOSOVIC
                    Yes.


      INT. CAR, 59THSTREET, ENGLEWOOD, CHICAGO - DAY

    The ghetto. The worst part. Alice Kane drives alone. Her eyes 
      glance searchingly left and right. 

      Approaching a corner she spots a group of young black men 
      hanging out, loudly joking, whiling time away. She thinks she 
      recognizes one of them from behind, she slows right down, 
      pulling up close. These guys aren t doing anything, but given 
      where we are, her nearing them like this is quite bold. She 
      looks at them all from inside her car.                                                                                     36.


      Slowly, they notice her staring and they turn to her, 
      inquisitive at first, but becoming aggressive when she does 
    not respond.  What lady? What do you want?   

      Finally the last to turn is the one she thought she d 
      recognized. When she sees his face she realizes she was 
      mistaken. She takes off, fast. 


      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, 5TH FLOOR, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - DAY

      Cameras clicking. The PRESS crammed in, fighting for the best 
      angle on a face to face summit at the long conference table.

                                  MORETTI (O.C.)
                    Mayor Kane and Chief English of the 
                    Potawatomi Nation have had good 
                    talks. They are excited about the 
                      possibility of a major 
                      archeological discovery...

      Kane and his administration on one side. Representatives of 
    the Potawatomi Nation on the other, all stone-faced and 
      dressed in identical Armanisuits. Their leader, CHIEF BILLY 
      ENGLISH, (male 60) is the only one wearing traditional garb, 
    his long grey hair cascading down both shoulders.

                                  MORETTI (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    ... Mayor Kane believes very 
                    strongly that any and all elements 
                    of the find should be housed in a 
                    museum, for safekeeping and proper 
                    preservation...

      RONNIE MORETTI, Kane s press spokesman reads a statement out 
    to the reporters as the cameras click away...

                                  MORETTI (CONT D)
                    We have already had contact with 
                    the Field Museum as well as the 
                    Smithsonian. Mayor Kane prefers a 
                    local museum so people can come to 
                    Chicago to see the treasurers of 
                    our country s past.

                                  KANE
                    And maybe stay in a hotel, buy a 
                    cup of coffee, a commemorative mug.

      Laughter.

                                  REPORTER 1
                    Does this call the ownership of the 
                    land into question?                                                                                    37.


                                  MORETTI
                    Guys. No questions. Please.

                                  REPORTER 2
                    How does this affect O Hare, sir?

                                  KANE

                    What s it going to take fellas?An 
                    airport casino?...

      More laughter in the room. Kane knows exactly how to play to 
    the  no questions , B-rollonly crowd. The Potawatomi smile 
      too. But not Chief English... he waits for it to subside...

                                  CHIEF ENGLISH

                      kasaysayan, nama isangsalita.

      Apparently Chief English also knows how to handle the B-roll
      only crowd. All the cameras have swung onto him, soaking up 
    his gravely solemn gibberish. Silence. He shows his hands...

                                  CHIEF ENGLISH (CONT D)
                    Proud builders.

      English rises. All his men rise with him. Kane stands, 
      reaches across and shakes his hand. Camera clicks go crazy.

                                  MORETTI
                          (ushering the press out)
                    Alright everyone, that s it. Thank 
                    you. Thank you. Thank you...

    CUT TO:Kane, Stone, Kitty and Moretti, sitting in the same 
      conference room. The press and the Potawatomi, gone.

                    That guy was two years ahead of me 
                    at Yale Law. Now he s dropping his

                                  MORETTI
                    It works.

                                  KANE
                    Find out what that was with his 
                    hands and... builders. If he wants 
                    a contract on O Hare, we ll make 
                    him bid against Mata s guy. Fuck 
                    them both. 

      Kane get s up, walks to the door...                                                                                     38.

      EXT. TEE BOX, LINKS, COLUMBUS PARK, WEST SIDE, CHICAGO - DAY

      Alderman LaloMata, at the tee, prepping his swing. With him, 
    his nephew Haime, MocoRuiz and two of Mata s ASSOCIATES who 
      even in these refined surroundings, sporting understated golf 
      Tsand slacks, cannot veneer over their true thug selves.

                                  MATA
                    You know, for almost all of its 
                    history, golf has been associated 
                    with...

                    stupid clothing ever conceived for 
                    a sport.

      They all stand watching the ball fly... and land... beat.

                    Well, tee off.

                    to grow. But as they become 
                    established, they become more

                    still holds. And you see, this is 
                    also the exact same trajectory that 
                    new ethnicities take when they 
                    first come to this country. At 
                    first they re all flash and dash, 
                    hair greased, hot wheels, pimp 
                    jewelry, pimp clothes. But the more 
                      established they become, the more 
                    austere in their tastes.

                    Except Blacks. The Blacks are the

                    with everyone else, this is the 
                    truth. As time passes, they begin 
                    to understand the value of modesty, 
                    of organized strength, of the power 
                    of groups making collective
                    decisions...

                    Do you understand, though?

                    Good.

      Mata puts his foot on top of his own ball, barely making an 
      effort to conceal it. He looks around.

                    You know, I think I must have

                    guys think you can find it for me?

                    Oh come, come.Let s go. Otherwise 
                    we re going to have to yield the 
                    field of play here. 

      Mata s two Associates crowd in on Ruiz and all three begin 
      toward the trees, past Mata. Mata practices his swing, 
      without looking back at them...

                                  MATA (CONT D)
                    And whoever finds my ball, please, 
                    try to contain your excitement... 
                    nothing vocal...

    WE STAY ON MATA, pushing in on him calmly swinging, as deep 
      behind him Ruiz and the Associates make it to the tree line 
    and are swallowed from view. REMAIN ON MATA, swing, breath, 
      swing, breath, the silence from the woods behind him 
      unbearable... then just as we hear the very first note of a 
      scream, we go to BLACK.


    We hear TINNY SOUNDS of DOWNTOWN TRAFFIC and ACTIVITY...

      A black screen pops to life... An iPadplays back a handheld 
      shot of Kane and Zajac, captured from a distance, when they 
      were on the roof of City Hall, shaking hands and smiling... 

      Reverse angle.Close on Governor Mac Cullen watching the 
      video on the iPad...


      EXT. GAS STATION, SOMEWHERE ON THE I55, MACOUPIN COUNTY - DAY

      Cullen and his Aide at a pit stop. Behind them, a vast field 
    of wheat stretches as far as the eye can see. Cullen looks up 
      from the iPadto his Aide s grave and intent face...

                                  CULLEN
                    You and your furrowed brow. You 
                    think you unearthedthis? He s 
                    toyingwith us. 

      Cullen s Aide stays mute. Cullen looks at the iPad...

                                  CULLEN (CONT D)
                    And this fucking thing. Every time 
                    you show me something on it, it s a 
                    God damn...

      Boiling over suddenly, Cullen smashes the iPadrepeatedly 
      against the car s roof. His Aide flinches, terrified.                                                                                     42.


      Cullen makes an almighty dent in the car, but the iPad
      remains intact. Stymied, he turns, tossing it like a discus 
    as hard as he can. It goes spinning far into the wheat field.

      Beat. Cullen bent over, huffing. His Aide, just staring...

                                  CULLEN (CONT D)

                    Well, go get it then. 

    CUT TO:Cullen getting into the car in a huff as his Aide 
      gingerly wades through the chest high wheat...

      INT. CAR, STATE STREET, ENGLEWOOD, CHICAGO - DAY

      Alice Kane, driving. She sees a lone man walking along the 
      road. As she shoots past she checks his face in the rearview 
      mirror. We recognize him - Darius  D , the young man who 
      brought his uncle to the clinic earlier. She pulls over, 
      takes a breath, looks around the street, no one coming, 
      throws the car in reverse and backs up, pulling up next to 
      him. He stops. Carefully, he looks down into the car, slowly 
      recognizes her and approaches. She lowers the window. 

                                  ALICE
                    Hey.

      Darius nods.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    I was just driving here... and I 
                    saw you...

                    How s your uncle?

                                  DARIUS

                                  DARIUS (CONT'D)
                    They said you organized for the 
                    breathing device.

                                  ALICE
                    He needed it.

                                  DARIUS
                    Thank you.

      There s a long awkward pause.

                                  ALICE
                    Can I give you a lift somewhere?

      Beat. Darius looks at her...

                                  DARIUS
                    You looking for something?

    She looks away, then back at him.

                                  ALICE
                    Yes.

    He looks up and down the street, gets in, and they take off. 


      INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER, 2ND FLOOR, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - DAY

      WIDE ON the city s grand council chamber. ALL FIFTY ALDERMEN 
    at their seats. Kane at the Mayor s dais, presiding.

                                  KANE
                    Chair recognizes Alderman Mata.

      Kane bangs his gavel. Mata rises, leans into his mic...

                                  MATA
                    Thank you Mr. President. The matter

                      appropriate the necessary funds to 
                    continue said services.

                          (gavel bang)
                    The ordinance has been heard.

                                  MATA
                    Mr. President, I d like to read out 
                    a proposed amendment.                                                                                    44.

    Mr. President, if I may, the 
      language of the amendment 
      contains all that there 
      really needs to be said or 
      known - -- Without oversight? Without

                          (taking command)
                    Mr. President, this is outrageous. 
                      I respectfully ask that we debate 
                    the merits of the amendment alone. 
                    We have had neither the opportunity 
                    nor the time...

      Kane does not respond. His silence is seized upon, a shouting 
      match flooding in to fill it. His allies calling for an 
      immediate vote with cries of  Roll Call!  Opponents shouting 
      objections,  Debate the amendment!  

    As he observes, Kane calls over the City Clerk s Assistant 
    and whispers something into his ear.                                                                                     45.


    The Clerk s Assistant takes off, out a side door. Kane s eyes 
      shift to the press boxes overlooking the chamber - one by one 
      they are being emptied by the clerks and start to go dark. 
      From them, Kane looks down to the chamber floor where other 
      clerks are quickly ushering all floor press and nonessentials 
    out and shutting the grand doors. 

      Back on Kane, watching. He is suddenly aware of a faint 
      knocking sound... He looks down, under the dais table... one 
    of his hands is involuntarily shaking, knocking. He reaches 
      with the other, steadies it, looks to his immediate right - 
      RACK TO KITTY, sitting at the back of the dais in her usual 
      place. She's the only person with an angle to have seen it, 
    but her look seems pressed firmly on the chamber floor.

      Placing both hands on the table, Kane rises, leaning over the 
      entire place it seems, and waits. WE STAY ON HIM as the 
      chamber quickly falls to a complete hush. Then...

                                  KANE
                    Hand over the hardware.

    The Aldermen twist, looking up and around the chamber, 
      realizing for the first time that they have been locked in. 
      With outside eyes no longer on them, they all seem to have 
      suffered a sudden collective loss of spine.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Laptops, Blackberries, phones, 
                    iPods, all of it... 

      They reach into their jackets, pant pockets, holsters, 
      briefcases, grabbing all their gizmos. Some have multiples, 
      like weapons concealed in all sorts of places. They hand them 
    up the aisles to Clerks waiting with boxes and dump them in.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    No word in, no word out. No 
                    Twitter, no Facebook, nothing. 
                          (beat, boring into them)
                    The amendment to the ordinance 
                    stands. Each of you will remain 
                    here until you decide what it is 
                    that you wish to do. I expect a 
                    simple up or down vote. If the 
                    motion loses, I will make every 
                    single vote publicly known. You can 
                    explain your decision to your 
                    constituents on your own.
                          (grabshis gavel)
                    Let the streets run with shit.

      Bang. He walks off the dais and out of the chamber leaving it 
    in utter silence.                                                                                     46.


      INT. 5TH FLOOR, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - EARLY EVENING

      Through the wrap around windows of the open floor, we see the 
      city outside bathed in dusk light. Staff is draining away...

                                  STONE (O.C.)
                    Zajac s news will hit in the 
                    morning. We re looking at lukewarm 
                    in the opinions, and nothing in the 
                    polls. As anticipated.

      Inside Kane s office.Kane sits with Stone.

                    have a statement, if needed, 
                    confirming your ongoing support. 
                    The wording is taken from your own 
                    speech, crusader of light, and so 
                    on. Do you want to see it?

                                  KANE
                    Who wrote it?

                                  STONE
                    Kitty.

                                  KANE
                    No.

                                  STONE
                    The drop on Cullen, when it comes, 
                    and your pivot away, we think the 
                    best way the handle it is to go 
                    with a single source. Exclusive. 
                    Anonymous. That way the rest of the 
                    media will devour each other either 
                    trying to out do it or debunk it.

                                  KANE
                    Good. Who?

      Stone places a picture of Sam Miller in front of Kane.

                                  STONE
                    Sam Miller. Tribune. We ve kicked 
                    his tires. No known political 
                      affiliations. Not a beat guy. Not 
                    one of ours either. Did an expos  
                    on City Hall last year. Ruffled 
                    some feathers. 

                                  KANE
                    Remind me.                                                                                    47.


                                  STONE
                    A handful of Aldermen ran their 
                    mouths off to him for a month, 
                    forgetting who he is, and he 
                    printed it all. Stupid shit they 
                    and their assholeaides usually 
                    say. Only surprising if you believe 
                    them to be paragons of intellect in 
                    the first place. But a council 
                    press consultant got canned for it 
                    and Miller got to ride two or three 
                    news cycles on it nationally. Left 
                    him with a reputation for not being 
                    afraid to burn bridges. Truth is, 
                    he doesn t have any, but that's his 
                    brand, so he's perfect for this.

                                  KANE
                    Where are we with the ward 
                    captains?

                                  STONE
                    They ll wait for instructions. For 
                    now they re crunching their numbers 
                    for turnout alone. When we tell 
                    them which way to go, they ll do 
                    their thing. 

                                  KANE
                    Anything else?

      Beat. Stone reaches into his folder...

                                  STONE
                    There's one more thing. These were 
                    taken today...

    He places new pictures on the table. Taken long-lensed 
      through windows, they show Miller meeting with Doctor Harris. 
      Kane betrays nothing. 

                                  STONE (CONT D)
                    He was asking her about you. She 
                    threw him out. 

                                  KANE
                    Who took these?

                                  STONE
                    One of my guys. Like I said, we 
                    were kicking his tires.

                                  KANE
                    How much do you know?                                                                                    48.


                                  STONE
                    All I ve told you.

                                  KANE
                    Keep it to that.

      Stone nods.

                                  STONE
                    And her?

                                  KANE
                    What do you think?

                                  STONE
                    I think a gentle reminder of 
                    certain oaths...

                                  KANE
                          (beat)
                    Remind her.

      Stone begins to collect his things...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    I need some medication. Quietly. 

                                  STONE
                    What do you need?

                                  KANE
                    No, I want to do it alone.

      Without skipping a beat, Stone writes a number on a scrap of 
      paper, no name, and passes it to Kane.

                                  STONE
                    He s quiet.


      EXT. HOUSING ROW, ENGLEWOOD, CHICAGO - EARLY EVENING

    As rough a spot as you can get. Though the neighborhood 
      avoided the massive mid century housing projects that made 
      Chicago s other poor neighborhood s infamous, to say this 
      place is still untouched by prosperity would be an 
      understatement. Alice and Darius pull up in her car.

                                  DARIUS
                    This is it.

    He looks out at a row of houses, some boarded up, all 
      dilapidated. Beat.                                                                                    49.


                                  DARIUS (CONT D)
                    You want to wait here?

    She looks around. People mill in groups under street lamps.

                                  ALICE
                    No. I ll come with you.

                                  DARIUS
                    Alright.

    He gets out first. She steals herself then also gets out. 
      Both head toward the houses.


      INT. KANE S OFFICE, 5TH FLOOR, CITY HALL, CHICAGO - EARLY 
      EVENING

      Kane sits on the couch by himself in the dark. Long beat. 
      Slowly he looks down at his hand, the one that wouldn t stop 
      shaking earlier. It s very still now. He turns it, flexes his 
      grip, releases, watching it as if it were not part of him.

      There is a knock on the door. He does not answer. The door 
      opens throwing in a shard of light. Kitty enters carrying a 
      pressed suit. She hangs it by his desk. When she turns to 
      leave, she catches him sitting in the dark and is startled. 

                                  KITTY
                    I m sorry. I thought there was no 
                    one in here. 
                          (offhis silence)
                    It s your suit. For tonight s 
                    dinner.

                                  KANE
                    Is it just a speech?

                                  KITTY
                    No, I couldn t get them to back 
                    down. They ll be giving you the 
                    Latino Business Association 
                    Chairman's Award.

                                  KANE
                    Can t phone-monkey out there bring 
                    that in for me?

                                  KITTY
                    Yes. He can.

      Beat.                                                                                    50.


                                  KANE
                    You are where you are. I ve always 
                    liked that you re unencumbered with 
                    excuses about it. Don t undermine 
                    yourself with shit like this.

                                  KITTY
                    Yes, sir.

    She makes her way to the door, pauses...

                                  KITTY (CONT D)
                    Sir, I hope you don t mind my 
                    asking, is everything alright?

                                  KANE
                    How long have you been working for 
                    me?

                                  KITTY
                    Eight years.

                                  KANE
                    Eight years.
                          (beat)
                    Don t ask me that again.

    The threat hits just as intended.

                                  KITTY
                    Yes, sir.

                                  KANE
                    Please leave the light off.

      Kitty steps out, pulling the door behind her. Outside, she 
      takes a breath.


      INT. HOUSE, ENGLEWOOD, CHICAGO - EARLY EVENING

      A large, old town house, split between multiple families. 
      Alice follows Darius up the stairs. Graffiti scratching on 
    the walls. Crappy fluorescent lighting. One floor up they 
      reach a door. Darius makes his way in, Alice behind him. 

                                  DARIUS
                    Wait here.

    He disappears into the apartment. A TV blares loudly. She 
      steps in a little. The place is a cramped mess. More people 
      live here than should.                                                                                    51.


      Down a hallway, through a door slightly ajar, she spots some 
    men in a room. She sees some money change hands. One of them 
      catches her looking and closes the door. She backs off, 
      growing anxious.

      Just beyond, she sees other people watching the loud TV. 
      Young and old, men and women. They eye her but say nothing. 
    She recognizes old uncle Edward, the breathing assistance 
      device gripped to his face. She smiles. He nods back. But 
      continues to stare - a piercing, quizzical stare: what are 
    you doing here?

    CUT TO:Darius, re-emerging from the bedroom, making his way 
      down the hallway to the entrance where he left Alice. He 
      finds the spot empty, the apartment door wide open...


      EXT. HOUSING ROW, ENGLEWOOD, CHICAGO - EARLY EVENING

      Alice rushes to her car, hurries in and drives off.


      EXT. CITY HALL, CHICAGO - EARLY EVENING

      Kane and Kitty exit the building. Kane, wearing his pressed 
      suit, makes his way to a waiting town car. Kitty to the tail 
    car waiting just behind it. 

      Inside Kane s town car, Meredith is already waiting.

                                  KANE
                    Meri.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Tom.
                          (beat)
                    How long is this thing going to be?

                                  KANE
                    Forty five minutes.

    She doesn t show any reaction. The car takes off.


      EXT. SOCCER FIELD, LINCOLN PARK, CHICAGO - EVENING

      Flood lit soccer practice is over. KIDS aged 8 to 12, still 
    run around passing and dribbling, squeezing every available 
      minute out of their time with each other while they wait to 
    get picked up by their parents. 

    In the parking area, right before the field, Doctor Elli 
      Harris steps out of her SUV and calls out for her son...                                                                                    52.


                                  DOCTOR HARRIS
                    Max!

    She motions for him to come. On the field, 8 year old MAX 
      notices her, makes a big pleading gesture for  5 more 
      minutes...  and resumes running with the others...

      Harris climbs back into the SUV, shaking her head.

      A GREY HAIRED MAN, white, collared shirt, khaki slacks, is 
      approaching her car. Before she has a chance to realize 
      what s happening, the man has hopped in on the passenger 
      side, grabbed her shoulder, planted a syringe into her arm 
    and injected her with it. Instantly she goes still. 

      Gently, he turns her head to face forward. He holds the 
      syringe up to her line of sight...

                                  GREY HAIRED MAN
                    This is a neuromuscular blocker. 
                    It s temporary. Please try to pay 
                    attention.

    As he speaks, he places her hands on the wheel, clears the 
      hair form her face so she can see out the windscreen.

                                  GREY HAIRED MAN (CONT D)
                          (dry)
                    Hippocrates, in part. "Whatever, in 
                    connection with my professional 
                    service, I see or hear in the life 
                    of men which ought not to be spoken 
                    of, I will not divulge, as 
                    reckoning that all such knowledge 
                    should be kept secret." 

      Through the windscreen, we see Max playing right there, yards 
      away. He notices his mother sitting so casually with the Grey 
      Haired Man. He s not alarmed but decides to abandon his game, 
      waves goodbye to the others and starts to approach the car... 

    In the car, Harris sees Max coming, her breathing speeds up. 

                                  GREY HAIRED MAN (CONT D)
                    I know you can t nod. I will assume 
                    you do understand the content of 
                    this message.

    Max is there. Hops in. The Grey Haired Man is gone.

                                  MAX
                    Who was that?                                                                                    53.


      Harris remains frozen, trying to still her breaths. One of 
    her hands loosens, she removes it from the steering wheel and 
      places it gently on Max  lap. A tear crawls down her face. 
    She clears her throat, it s loosening too...

                                  DOCTOR HARRIS
                    Just give mommy a moment.

    We hear the sound of rapturous applause... 


      INT. PALMER HOUSE HILTON, MONROE STREET, CHICAGO - EVENING

      Wide on the breathtaking beaux arts lobby of the Palmer House 
      Hilton. Kane and Meredith make their way across. Kitty 
      follows.

                                  KANE (O.S.)
                    You are the new energy.

    CUT TO:Outside the open doors to the magnificent Empire 
      Room, a sign announces the event: The Latino Business 
      Association Annual Gala Dinner. In honor of his honor the 
      Mayor Thomas Kane. Recipient of the Chairman s Award.

                                  KANE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    The rest of us are the sediments, 
                    the layers beneath.

    CUT TO: Inside the Empire Room. Kane and Meredith seated at 
    the high table. Dinner is being served - extravagantly 
      presented Chile Relleno, cascades of cream, stuffings of 
      meat. Meredith eyes hers, a grin covering her dread. 

    CUT TO:The CHAIRMAN of the LBAat the podium mic...

                                  CHAIRMAN
                    Our friend. Thomas Kane.

      Ovation in the room. Kane makes his way to the podium, 
      smiles, receives his award, shakes the Chairman s hand...

    CUT TO: Kane, mid-speech...

                                  KANE
                    You re the top soil. The good 
                    stuff. Toiling, striving. It s your 
                    time. Because achievement does not 
                    frighten you... You know, there s 
                    something we say, we talk about 
                    pulling yourself up by your 
                      bootstraps. I think the closest you 
                    guys have to it is... here I go... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    54.

                    culo.

      Laughter erupts in the room. Claps. We find Alderman Mata at 
      a table with Associates and nephew Haime, heartily clapping. 

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                          (riding the wave)
                    Am I right?

      More laughter. We find Zajac, leaning toward the guy next to 
    him for a translation, already pre-emptingit with a laugh.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    He who wants fish, needs to get his 
                    ass wet...

      Explosions of laughter. We find Meredith, her permanent half 
      smile, changeless.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    My friends. As long as you get 
                    yours wet, I will get mine wet 
                    right with you.

      They re on their feet. Everyone. Clapping. Laughing.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                          (holds award aloft)
                    Thank you.

    CUT TO:Kane and Meredith walking through the throngs of 
      tables, shaking hands, exchanging smiles. Gifts are offered, 
      plaques, bottles of mescal, tequila, a man gives Kane a faux 
      Mexican moustache and a huge sombrero. He clips on the 
      moustache, turns to Meredith. She does a  not bad  motion. It 
      brings the house down. 

      Approaching them, we see the head of a man from behind, 
      heavily bandaged around, early-80sMcEnroestyle, his greased 
    up black hair jutting out on top. He holds a gift box, 
      distinctively wrapped. The man moves through the crowd right 
    up to Kane and stops... It's MocoRuiz. 

                                  RUIZ
                    Mr. Mayor...
                          (hands Kane the gift box)
                    When you speak. We listen.

    Big smiles. Kane pulls Ruiz in, posing for the cameras. 
      Clicks away.                                                                                    55.


      EXT. PALMER HOUSE HILTON, MONROE STREET, CHICAGO - EVENING

      Kane and Meredith emerge and make it to their waiting car. 
      Kitty holds the door for them, shuts it and the car takes 
      off. The tail car follows.

      Kitty is on the sidewalk alone. She buttons up her coat, 
      turns and is about to leave when through the hotel s street 
      windows, she sees Zajac in the lobby holding court with a 
      group of much shorter Latino business people. They are in his 
      thrall. She takes a moment, removes her coat, lets it hang 
      over her arm and enters the hotel again. 

      Inside.Kitty slowly walks across the lobby, past Zajac, 
      never once looking at him. He notices her through the corner 
    of his eye, watches her disappear through a side door, into a 
      stairwell. A sign above it reads:  Fire Escape ...


      INT. KANE S TOWN CAR, STREETS, CHICAGO - EVENING

      Silence. Meredith s look firmly out the window. Kane looks at 
      her. Long beat.

                                  KANE
                    Thanks for doing that.

    The slightest flinch in her eyes betrays her startlementat 
    his overture. But she keeps quiet, looking out.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Maybe I ll stay at the house 
                    tonight.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You do want you want, Tom.

      Beat. Kane gives up.

                                  KANE
                          (to the driver)
                    Frank, you have your Sox cap?

                                  DRIVER
                    Never go without it, sir.

                                  KANE
                    Hand it over, will you.

    The cap comes over. Kane puts it on.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    And pull over, please.                                                                                    56.


    The car comes to a stop. Meredith could not be less 
      interested in the reason why. Kane gets out.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    I won t need you for the rest of 
                    the night.

                                  DRIVER
                    Yes, sir.

      Kane shuts the door. The car takes off. Kane walks back to 
    the tail car, also pulled over, opens the door...

                                  KANE
                    Fellas, I m going to need this car.

    His two security guys hop out.

                                  SECURITY MAN 1
                    Sir...

                                  KANE
                    Give me your jacket.

      Security Man 1 hands it over. Kane puts it on, zips up, gets 
      into the car.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Pick it up later at the house. No 
                    one follows.

      Kane drives off.

    CUT TO:Kane, driving. He reaches for the scrap of paper with 
    the number Stone gave him, dials it on his cell. It s 
      answered.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Hello?

                                  KANE
                    I got this number from Ira Stone.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Do you know how this works?

                                  KANE
                    No.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    You tell me what you need I tell 
                    you when and where we meet. Come 
                    alone. Turn off your phone.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE) (CONT'D)
                    Not standby, off. Do you have a GPS
                    in your car? 

                                  KANE
                    No.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Good. Hold on...
                          (long beat)
                    Alright. Tell me what you need.


      EXT. MILTON OLIVE PARK, LAKE FRONT, CHICAGO - EVENING

    The place is quiet, empty. Kane waits, alone. Behind him, the 
      vast buildings of the JardineWater Purification Center, 
      ghostly lit against the black void of Lake Michigan at night. 

      Before him, his city, twinkling with life. His eyes gaze 
      across it. From Soldier field to the John Hancock Center, 311 
      South Wacker, the WrigleyBuilding, the Dan Ryan 
      Expressway... On each image we hear him whisper a name...

                                  KANE
                    Kelly... Daley... Dever... 
                      Washington...

      Close on Kane, silent.

    The sound of distant footsteps. Kane peers into the darkness. 
      A figure is approaching him... he readies himself... Just 
      then his phone rings. He scrambles to get it from his pocket. 
    The number on it is BLOCKED. He takes a chance.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Hello?

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Dad?

                                  KANE
                    Alice?

      Kane sees the approaching figure slow down... 

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE) 
                          (beat)
                    You called me?

                                  KANE
                    Yes. Yes...
                          (seeing the figure turn 
                            around)
                    How are you?                                                                                    58.


                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    What is it, Dad?

      Kane covers the receiver.

                                  KANE
                          (calling out to the 
                            figure)
                    Wait...

    The figure starts away. Kane goes after him...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Alice, I'm sorry, I... Can I call 
                    you back? 5 minutes. No more.

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                          (beat)
                    Sure.

                                  KANE
                    Can you give me a number? The only 
                    one I have is at the church. 

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    You know, I'll call you, Dad. 

                                  KANE
                    No, Alice - 

                                  ALICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    I ll call you.

                                  KANE
                    When?

      CLICK - the line goes dead. Kane, puts his phone away. 
      Reaches the figure. 

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Wait. Wait... 

                                  MAN
                          (not looking, still 
                            walking)
                    I said no phones.

                                  KANE
                    I m sorry. Please. Stop. 

    The man stops, his back still to Kane. Kane stops too.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Please. It s off. It s off.                                                                                    59.

                          (beat)
                    Wait here.

    The man walks off, 20 yards or so and stops. Kane watches him 
      wait, looking around for a long beat. Nothing coming. He 
      returns, reaches into his jacket, hands Kane a paper bag... 

                                  MAN (CONT D)

                          (beat)
                    Do you know who I am?

    For the first time, the man looks at him, instantly 
      recognizes him.

                                  MAN
                    No.

      Kane nods. Hands him an envelope.

                                  KANE
                    It s all in there - 

      Before he has had a chance to finish the man has taken the 
      envelope and is already fast away... leaving Kane alone.


      INT. PALMER HOUSE HILTON, MONROE STREET, CHICAGO - EVENING

    In the stairwell. Zajac, back against the wall. Kitty, one 
    leg up, pinning him back. His suit pants down, hers dangling 
      around her ankle. Her grunts, aggressively loud. He covers 
    her mouth. She stops, removes his hand from her mouth and 
      resumes, grunting up the concrete and metal stairwell.

    CUT TO:They re done. His pants up again. He straightens his 
      hair.

                                  ZAJAC
                    Kitty... what s your real name?

                                  KITTY
                    That is my real name.

    He shrugs. Smiles. 

                                  ZAJAC
                    Wait five minutes.

    Out he goes. She, still panting, continues to adjust her 
      clothes.                                                                                     60.


    We hear church bells ringing, calling the beginning of 
      evening service...


      INT. RECTOR S ROOM, CALVARY EPISCOPAL CHURCH, CHICAGO - 
      EVENING

      Continued sound of church bells ringing. Alice holds her cell 
      phone along with the note she got earlier that says  Dad. 555-
      1212  in her hand. She stares at them then places them down 
    on a coffee table and collects a stiff white clerical collar 
    off it, adjusting it to her neck. 


      INT. CALVARY EPISCOPAL CHURCH, CHICAGO - EVENING

    The main church hall. Alice in full liturgical vestment, at 
    the altar leading service. She holds her arms wide...

                                  ALICE
                    We break this bread to share the 
                    body of Christ.

                                  CONGREGATION
                    We are one in spirit. We are one in 
                    Christ.

    The organ plays an AgnusDei. The congregation file up to 
      receive communion. Alice hands out a wafer to each in turn.

                                  ALICE
                          (repeated)
                    The body of Christ...

      Back of the hall, the church door edges open and Darius 
      enters quietly. He crosses himself, takes a seat in the back 
      most pew. From the altar, Alice s look momentarily finds him, 
    but she does not skip a beat, continues giving communion...


      EXT. CALVARY EPISCOPAL CHURCH, CHICAGO - EVENING

      Service is over. Outside, people are leaving, Alice saying 
      goodbye to them. Darius waits for his turn... steps up...

                                  DARIUS
                    Missed you earlier.

                                  ALICE
                    Yes.

                                  DARIUS
                    Thank you again for what you did 
                    for my uncle.                                                                                    61.


      Alice nods. Darius extends his hand, shakes hers. We catch a 
      quick glimpse of something small wrapped in plastic he slips 
      into her hand. If it startled her, she covers it well.

                                  ALICE
                    Thank you for coming.

      Darius steps away. Alice is already onto the next goodbye...


      EXT. KANE HOME, GOLD COAST, CHICAGO - NIGHT

      Kane pulls up to his grey stone, turn of the century 
      townhouse, hops out and tosses the car keys to his two 
      security men, pacing on the sidewalk. 

                                  SECURITY 1 
                    Good night, sir.

                                  KANE
                    Fellas.

    He enters the house.


      INT. KANE HOME, GOLD COAST, CHICAGO - CONTINUOUS

      It's dark. Cold. Quiet. The only light comes from the 
      kitchen. Kane heads for it.

    On the kitchen table he finds a pile of gifts from the Latino 
      Business Association. A note reads:  A selection. Kitty .

      Next to them, a stack of single sheet newspaper front pages. 
      Another note, same handwriting, reads:  Tomorrow s proofs .
    All of them, the Sun-Times, the Tribune..., carry the same 
      story. Kane picks up the Daily Herald - Headline:  ENTER 
      ZAJAC! State treasurer takes on Cullen in the primary .

      Kane reaches into his paper bag, takes out his newly acquired 
      medication, gets himself a glass of water and downs a pill.

    He grabs his cell, finds a number:  Alice. Church . He 
      ponders. Hits dial. It rings...


      INT. RECTOR S ROOM, CALVARY EPISCOPAL CHURCH, CHICAGO - SAME

    The phone rings. No one there to answer it...                                                                                    62.


      INT. ANEX BUILDING, CALVARY EPISCOPAL CHURCH, CHICAGO - SAME

    The phone in the clinic reception rings... not a soul in the 
      whole place... except...

      Inside a curtained examination cubicle.Alice sits by herself 
      palming the note that says:  Dad. 555-1212 . The phone rings 
      insistently. Finally she rises, steps up to a large disposal 
    can marked:  Hazardous and Medical Material Only .She dumps 
    the little plastic bag of white powdery crystals that Darius 
      gave her, crunches up the note, dumps that too and walks out 
    of the cubicle turning the light off. The phone continues to 
      ring unanswered...


      INT. KANE HOME, GOLD COAST, CHICAGO - SAME

      Kane hangs up. Takes a moment. Suddenly his phone rings. He 
      answers.

                                  KANE
                    Alice?

                                  STONE (ON THE PHONE)
                    It s Stone.

                                  KANE
                          (beat)
                    Yup.

                    The ordinance. We re still 4 yeas 
                    shy of a majority.

                                  KANE
                    Who s holding out?

                                  STONE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Ross and his Gang of Six... The 
                    South Side Nine... The entire 
                      GoogooBlock... 

    As stone talks we see the inside of the council chamber.
      ANGLE ON each dissenting faction as he names them. Blood shot 
      eyes, some nodding off in their seats, others trying to get 
    on with paperwork, still others whisper-plotting with their 
      gang leaders...

                    they re sweating it out hoping

                    It s a fun little game of chicken 
                    they re playing in there.

      Back on Kane in his kitchen.Phone to ear...

                                  STONE (ON THE PHONE) (CONT D)
                    All city waste management operators 
                    have already been warned. Starting 
                    in the morning, nothing s getting 
                    picked up. Looks like we ll have a 
                    fight on this one.

                                  KANE
                    So be it. 

                                  STONE
                    Yeah.
                          (beat)
                    You got what you were looking for?

                                  KANE
                    Yes. Thanks. 
                          (beat)
                     Night Stoney.

                                  STONE
                    Boss.

      They hang up. Kane s eyes go back to the pile of gifts from 
    the Latino Biz people. In the middle of them, he spots the 
      distinctively wrapped box he received from MocoRuiz. He 
      unwraps it, lifts the lid and finds, resting centered on a 
    bed of cotton, a pair of severed human ears. MocoRuiz  very 
      own.

    He takes them out, looks at them impassively then heads to 
    the sink. He dumps them down the drain, runs the water and 
      hits the garbage disposal switch. It runs then suddenly 
      sputters, clunks and dies on him. 

    His shoulders drop.

    CUT TO:Second floor. Kane reaches the top of the stairs. To 
    his right, down the hall, he sees a sliver of light under a 
      closed door. He goes to it, waits a beat, then knocks.

                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                    Yes.

      Kane opens the door. Meredith is on her bed busily fast-
      reading and annotating a document, paperwork spread all over.

      Kane remains at the threshold. Beat.                                                                                    64.


                                  KANE
                    You re awake.

    She continues her work, does not look up.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Yes.

                                  KANE
                    We need a plumber.
                          (offher silence)
                    Garbage disposal, it s broken.

                                  MEREDITH
                    OK.

                                  KANE
                    I ll get someone from the office to 
                    send someone.
                          (beat, then)
                    Meri...

      Something in the way he said that has her look up at him 
      finally. She puts her document and pen down.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Tom.

    He looks at her for a long beat. Nothing gives in her. 
      Finally...

                                  KANE
                    Good night.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Good night.

    He pulls the door closed on her. Turns and leaving us behind, 
      heads to the other end of the corridor. He opens the door to 
    his bedroom, flicks the light on, hesitates for moment 
      looking back at us, then disappears into the room closing the 
      door.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
