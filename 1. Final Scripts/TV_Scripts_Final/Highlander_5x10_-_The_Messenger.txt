901901EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

      A BIKE whines down a dark street, pulls to a curb.  RICHIE
      props the kickstand and gets off, starts to move away --
      then he gets the BUZZ.  He looks around.  There's no sign of
      the other Immortal, but they're close, he can feel it.

      He draws his sword and moves warily along the street, senses
      on edge, pausing at shadows and darkened stoops.  His sense
      of danger is growing.  He hears his heart pounding in his
      ears, until it drowns out everything else.  As he passes an
      ALLEYWAY and continues --

      A DARK FIGURE slides into view behind him.

      Richie feels the presence.  He whirls around, sword up,
      bracing for an attack -- but what he hears is a calm voice
      with an air of quiet strength.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm Richie Ryan.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Don't be afraid, Richie Ryan.

      Who the hell does this guy think he is?  Richie smells a
      trick, maneuvers to meet the expected charge.

                                      RICHIE
                          (pumped)
                    What makes you think I'm scared?

                                      MESSENGER
                    You're holding your sword.

      There's gentle reproof in the tone.  Richie snorts, takes a
      better grip on his sword.

                                      RICHIE
                    You got that right, Einstein.

                                      MESSENGER
                    But all I want to do is talk.

                                      RICHIE
                    What about?  The weather?

                          (beat)
                    Or what you're gonna do with my head?

      The Immortal steps into the light: he's tall, bearded, with
      intelligent eyes and a gentle, regal composure.  Later we
      come to call him Messenger, but for now he has no name.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Peace.

      The word hangs in the air, simple and surprising.

                                      RICHIE
                    Good line, pal...  but no dice.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I swear you're in no danger.  I
                    stopped taking heads a long time
                    ago.

      He opens his coat, revealing that he has no sword.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    I'm not armed.

      Richie edges back, not sure whether the guy is crazy, or
      setting him up.

                                      RICHIE
                    Everyone carries a sword.  Everyone
                    takes heads...  we fight or we die.

                                      MESSENGER
                    That's what you were taught...
                          (beat)
                    What if you could stop fighting?
                          (intense)
                    Imagine it!
                          (beat)
                    What if all Immortals could live in
                    peace?  Real, eternal peace?  Think
                    about it, Richie Ryan, and dream.

      His voice is earnest, compelling, but Richie doesn't seem to
      buy it.  He raises his sword.

                                      RICHIE
                    Who are you?

                                      MESSENGER
                    The oldest of us still left alive.

      And as Richie stares, the Messenger kneels before him, raises
      his head so his neck is bared, open to attack.  He looks
      into Richie's face.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    It's up to you.  You can have my
                    head...  or you can listen to what I
                    have to say.

      Richie's blade still looms over the Messenger as we --

902902EXT.  DOCKS - DAY

      A waterside area, with various BOATHOUSES and repair sheds. 
      Moored along the dock is a large, older SAILBOAT.

      MacLeod is on the deck, looking over the boat while HARRY, a
      crusty, grizzled Walter Brennan type sailor he's dealt with
      before, looks on.  MacLeod checks some rigging, then swings
      back onto the dock beside Harry.

                                      HARRY
                    Thought your friend was comin'.

      MacLeod shrugs, picks up a rag.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Richie gets here when he gets here.

      He wipes his hands with a rag as Harry re-tamps his pipe. 
      They look at the boat a BEAT.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You were right, Harry.  She's got
                    good lines...  but she needs a major
                    re-fit.

      Harry nods affably, starts lighting his pipe.

                                      HARRY
                    Yep.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Could have some rot below the
                      waterline.  Engine's taken salt. 
                    New rigging all 'round...
                          (beat)
                    She's not worth fifty-thousand, Harry. 
                    Not even forty.

                                      HARRY
                          (agreeably)
                    Nope.

      MacLeod looks at him, piqued.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So why didn't you tell me that over
                    the phone?

                                      HARRY
                      Because...  she'll go for twenty.

      He smiles craftily.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You old fart.

      He breaks into a slow smile, then gets the BUZZ.  He turns,
      expecting Richie, but his face goes cold as he sees --

      WILLIAM CULBRAITH

      thirtyish, a hard-faced immortal with a long scar down one
      cheek.  Culbraith gives a curt nod of recognition, then he
      lifts his blade and points to a nearby BOATHOUSE.  The
      invitation is clear: follow and fight.

      MacLeod reacts...  he will need no urging.

                                      HARRY
                    So, you want her?

                                      MACLEOD
                    We'll talk later.

      MACLEOD

      drops the rag and moves after Culbraith, his face hard with
      anger: whoever this guy is, MacLeod wants to take him out. 
      As MacLeod steps into the BOATHOUSE --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

902A902AEXT.  WOODS - GEORGIA - 1864 - DAY

      MacLeod and JEFFREY, a recently freed slave, are running
      through the woods.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      A Confederate PATROL is moving through the trees, on the
      alert.

      MACLEOD AND JEFFREY

      splash through a stream.  Jeffrey stumbles and MacLeod slows.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let's stop a minute.

      Jeffrey comes to a stop, breathing hard, resting hands on
      thighs as he recovers from the run.

      MacLeod is winded as well.  He takes a swig from his canteen,
      offers it to Jeffrey.  Jeffrey is reaching for it when

      MACLEOD

      reacts to the sound of a branch breaking.

      TWO CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS

      step out from behind the trees nearby, guns leveled at MacLeod
      and Jeffrey.

      JEFFREY

      raises his hands slowly.

                                      JEFFREY (CONT'D)
                    You got us.

                                      CONFEDERATE
                    You bet we do.

      He cocks his rifle to fire.  Jeffrey's eyes widen in fear. 
      MACLEOD reaches for his pistol.  The Confederate Soldier
      swings his rifle toward MacLeod -- as he expected -- but:

                                      JEFFREY
                    NO!

      JEFFREY

      rushes in front of MacLeod.  He takes the bullet in the leg. 
      He goes down hard as

      TWO MORE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS

      emerge from cover.  MacLeod and Jeffrey are surrounded. 

      MACLEOD

      crouches over Jeffrey, stemming the blood, his gun forgotten
      on the ground beside him.  A soldier prods him with a rifle
      barrel.

                                      CONFEDERATE
                    On your feet.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That bullet shattered his leg.  He
                    can't walk!

                                      CONFEDERATE
                    Then you're gonna carry him.

      He points MacLeod's pistol at Jeffrey's head.

                                      CONFEDERATE (CONT'D)
                    Or he's staying here.

      MacLeod helps Jeffrey up.

903903EXT.  ANDERSONVILLE PRISON - 1864 - DAY

      A wooden stockade, with high walls, and a fenced off HUT at
      one end.  Through the FORT GATES, several UNION PRISONERS
      are marched at bayonet-point by thin, predatory CONFEDERATE
      GUARDS.  The new arrivals are mostly intact: uniformed and
        disciplined, with some walking wounded.  Among them --

      MacLeod, wearing civvies, helps JEFFREY, a young ex-slave. 
      Jeffrey has a stained bandana tied around a leg wound, and
      he limps painfully.

                                      JEFFREY
                    We don't belong in here, Mr. MacLeod. 
                    We ain't even soldiers.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We'll be okay, Jeffrey.  Just stay
                    close.  I'm gonna take care of you.

      Jeffrey is too slow, and HICKSON, a tough Confederate Sergeant
      with a handlebar moustache, prods him.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Let him be.  Can't you see he's
                    wounded?

                                      HICKSON
                    You ride with the devil, you fry
                    with the devil.
                          (beat)
                    Now get goin'.
                          (re Jeffrey)
                    And tell the slave he better hurry.

      He gestures with his gun, and they move up to join the rest
      of the soldiers, who are stopped in a line, staring in stunned
      silence at the sight before them.  GREENWELL, the Union
      Sargeant, removes his cap.

                                      GREENWELL
                    Sweet Jesus.

      A tattered horde of UNION PRISONERS shoe-horned into the
      stockade.  Uniforms frayed or non-existent.  Some on crutches,
      limbless, wearing filthy bandages.

      Gaunt faces, untrimmed hair and beards.

      MEN

      Hickson grins at the new arrivals.

                                      HICKSON
                    Welcome to Hell, boys.

      He salutes mockingly, and the Guards move off.  As the
      soldiers stand there, some rattier long-time inmates approach
      the newcomers.  One INMATE runs a hand hungrily down Jeffrey's
      arm.

      Jeffrey throws a stricken look at MacLeod.  MacLeod grabs
      the man's arm, shoves him stumbling back into the dirt.

      Greenwell is staring at the prisoners, sickened.

                                      GREENWELL
                    God help me.  These are Union
                    soldiers.

                                      MACLEOD
                    They were.

      Greenwell grabs the Inmate, drags him to his feet.

                                      GREENWELL
                    Who's in charge of this hell-hole?

      Before anyone can speak -- BANG -- a GUARD fires his gun in
      the air, and SILENCE instantly blankets the stockade.  Every
      eye turns to the HUT, fixed on the door there.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I believe we're about to find out.

      MacLeod feels the BUZZ, and a moment later --

      CULBRAITH

      a Confederate Colonel, steps out onto the porch.  He surveys
      the rabble before him with almost a look of dread.

      The prisoners freeze, watching him in utter silence: the
      cold eyes, the scarred face.  Feeling the BUZZ, Culbraith's
      eyes rake the crowd -- linger briefly on MacLeod -- then
      move on.  He addresses the camp in a grave voice.  What he's
      about to do gives him no pleasure.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    I have warned you.  There is no escape
                    from Andersonville prison.  It is
                    futile.  It is suicidal.  To those
                    who try and to others.
                          (beat)
                    What I do now is on your head, not
                    mine.

      He nods to the Hickson, on one side of the stockade, where
      three guards drag four ragged UNION PRISONERS before the
      stockade wall.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    You know the rules -- one man tries
                    to escape, he and three others die.

      A shocked MURMUR from the assembled prisoners.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    SILENCE!
                          (beat)
                    It's a harsh lesson, but it is one
                    you have forced me to teach.

      He nods his head.  Hickson raises his arm: the GUARDS level
      their rifles, prepare to fire at the prisoners.

      MACLEOD

      surges forward.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You can't!  This is murder!

      Culbraith freezes, raises a hand -- stalling the execution. 
      MacLeod holds Culbraith's eyes.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    No one can question my authority
                    here.
                          (to a Guard)
                    Bring him to my quarters.

      The GUARD drives a rifle butt into MacLeod's head.  MacLeod
      goes down in a heap.  Culbraith turns on his heel and steps
      inside, leaving MacLeod lying there.

904904INT.  CULBRAITH S QUARTERS - 1864 - LATER

      Culbraith is at his writing desk, looking at a picture. 
      CLOSE ON a black and white tintype of a pretty Southern woman
      and her two daughters.  Then

      PULL BACK

      to find the windows overlooking the stockade and the
      prisoners, as MacLeod is brought in by Hickson and two Guards.

      Culbraith continues writing.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Thank you, Sergeant.

      Hickson salutes and leaves.  Culbraith puts his quill aside
      and regards MacLeod.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    Colonel William Everett Culbraith.

                    And I'll stand.

      Culbraith stands and examines MacLeod.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I hear you're an abolitionist,
                    MacLeod.
                          (beat)
                    It may surprise you that I, too,
                    share certain ill feelings about the
                      institution of slavery.  In fact, on
                    my farm outside Atlanta, my wife and
                    I have no slaves of our own.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No, but you have Andersonville.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I take it you don't approve of my
                    prison.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This is no prison, Culbraith.  It's
                      a slaughterhouse.

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (with great distaste)
                    It's all slaughter, isn't it?  What
                    we do.  What they do.
                          (beat)
                    I've seen more death in this war
                    than I have in a dozen lifetimes.
                          (beat)
                    I grow sick of the war.  Ours and
                    theirs.

                    But I am a soldier, sir, and I have

                                      MACLEOD
                    Orders.  Do your orders tell you to
                    treat those men like animals?

                                      CULBRAITH
                    If they are animals, it is because
                    of the way they treat each other. 
                    No discipline, no honor.  They kill
                    one another for a crust of bread.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (with passion)
                    Because they're starving.
                          (with reason)
                    Those men are soldiers.  They deserve
                    respect.

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (with passion)
                    These soldiers are destroying the
                    South.  My South.
                          (resigned)
                    The truth is, I have no food to give
                    them.  These are hard times.  My own
                    guards are on half rations.  What
                    would you have me do?

                                      MACLEOD
                    For a start, I'd show mercy to the
                    men you're about to have killed.

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (beat)
                    I can't afford mercy.

      Culbraith goes to the window, his face full of regret.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    When one escape goes unpunished,
                      discipline breaks down.  Without
                      discipline, we descend into chaos.
                          (hard)
                    And I will not suffer chaos under my
                    command.

      He raises his hand, his white handkerchief in it, prepares
      to signal the firing squad.

      The firing squad takes aim at the prisoners.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Killing them won't stop them from
                    trying to escape!

      Culbraith lowers his hand.

      THE FIRING SQUAD

      SHOOTS -- and the prisoners crumple like rag dolls.

      Silence follows the blast of the rifles.

      RESUME - MACLEOD AND CULBRAITH

      MacLeod takes a step towards him.  Instantly Culbraith's
      sword is out, at MacLeod's neck.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I don't enjoy killing, MacLeod, but
                    I will if you make me.

      And OFF this, Guards enter and take MacLeod's arms.  They
      drag him out, still holding Culbraith's eyes.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

905905INT.  BOATHOUSE - THE PRESENT - DAY

      MacLeod and Culbraith are in mid-battle, fighting around the
      boathouse, neither asking or giving quarter.  Then Culbraith
      slips on the decking, goes down MacLeod wounds him in the
      side.  Culbraith goes to his knees.  MacLeod raises his sword
      for the final blow.  He's about to swing -- and they both
      get the BUZZ.  MacLeod hesitates but only for a moment.  He
      starts to bring the sword down

      MACLEOD

      is thrown, half-turns to Richie --

      Culbraith sees his chance.  He rolls aside -- grabs his sword --
      and keeps rolling OFF the walkway into the water.  MacLeod
      scrambles to the edge to look after him:

      Nothing.  Bubbles, a ripple -- he's gone.  MacLeod looks at
      Richie in fury, then storms out.

906906EXT.  DOCKS - CONTINUOUS

      MacLeod moves along the docks, pissed, Richie trying to catch
      up.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, would you give me a chance to

                    that murdering bastard is still alive.

                                      RICHIE
                    I know.

      The calm way he says this stops MacLeod.  He stares at Richie.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You wanted Culbraith to live?  Do
                    you have any idea what he is?

                                      RICHIE
                    It doesn't matter.  It has to stop.

      MacLeod stares at Richie like he's flipped.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What has to stop?

                                      RICHIE
                    All of it.  The fighting, taking
                    heads, dying...  It's time to end
                    it, Mac.
                          (beat)
                    We can end it.

      MacLeod sees the light of conviction in Richie's eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because you say so?

      He starts to walk away.

                                      RICHIE
                    Just hear me out!  Someone taught
                    you to kill, right?  Someone taught
                    that to him...  and someone before
                    that.

                                      MACLEOD

                    It can't happen.

      A small FIRE near makeshift tents.  MacLeod and Jeffrey are
      with Greenwell and a few Soldiers.  Jeffrey lies on a blanket,
      shivering and sweating as MacLeod prepares to look at his
      leg.  He puts on a brave front.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's going to hurt, Jeffrey.

                    I'd be honored.

      MacLeod rips open Jeffrey's pant leg, revealing the wound --
      and tries to hide his reaction.  It's as bad as it gets. 
      Jeffrey looks at MacLeod hopefully.

                                      JEFFREY
                    How is it?  It's better, ain't it?

      MacLeod covers up the leg.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

      Jeffrey stares, then shakes his head in denial.

                                      JEFFREY
                    It can't be.  I feel better, Mr.
                    MacLeod.  The leg don't hurt any
                    more...

                                      MACLEOD
                    The nerves are dead.
                          (harder)
                    Jeffrey, the leg's got to come off. 
                    If it doesn't, it'll spread.  You'll
                    die.

      Jeffrey closes his eyes, shaking his head.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    It's not the end.  You'll live...
                    You'll still have children.

                                      JEFFREY
                    Just won't be able to run no races

      He manages a weak smile.  The kid has heart.

                    Keep still.  I'm going after a doctor.

      He stands and heads off into the dark.  Greenwell looks at
      Jeffrey and shakes his head.

908908INT.  CULBRAITH S QUARTERS - 1864 - LATER - NIGHT

      Culbraith stands by his desk.  MacLeod stands before him,
      Hickson and a Guard eyeing him, weapons at the ready.

                    If the leg comes off now, he'll live.

                    morning.

      He returns to his desk and starts writing.  And OFF MacLeod's
      reaction --

909909EXT.  ANDERSONVILLE PRISON - 1864 - LATER - NIGHT

      Jeffrey looks worse than before.  MacLeod settles on the
      ground beside him and wipes his forehead.

                                      JEFFREY
                    I didn't figure he'd come.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You have to hold on, Jeffrey.  'Til
                    tomorrow morning.

                                      JEFFREY
                    I can wait.  It's not like I'm real
                    anxious to see him.

      He manages a weak smile, and coughs.  MacLeod gives him a
      sip of water from a canteen.  Jeffrey sighs and settle back.

                                      JEFFREY (CONT'D)
                    Mr. MacLeod?  Thank you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    For what?  I'm the one who got you
                    into this.

                                      JEFFREY

      Jeffrey closes his eyes.  MacLeod stays awake, looking up at
      the night sky.  And OFF this --

910910INT.  CULBRAITH S QUARTERS - ANDERSONVILLE - 1864 - MORNING

      Culbraith is getting dressed as Hickson enters and stands at
      attention at the door.  He has a dispatch.

                                      HICKSON
                    I beg your pardon, sir, but the
                    courier said it was urgent.  It's
                    from your brother-in-law.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Very well, Sergeant, come in.

      Culbraith reads the dispatch silently to himself.  As he
      reads, his face is covered with despair.

                                    SAD SOUTHERN VOICE (V.0.)
                    Dear Colonel, Georgia is burning
                    from Atlanta to the sea.  Thousands
                    have died.  It grieves me to tell
                    you this, but your wife...  my
                    sister...  and the children...

      A voice interrupts.

                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    Colonel Culbraith.

      Culbraith says nothing.  His face hardens into a mask that
      is beyond pain, beyond hate.

      MACLEOD

      stands in the doorway under the watchful eye of a couple of
      Confederate soldiers.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I've come about the surgeon.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Your request is denied.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Dammit, the man is dying in agony.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Agony is what war is about, Mr.
                    MacLeod.

      He starts to turn away.  MacLeod gets in his face.

                                      MACLEOD
                    At least give me a knife!  Let me
                    try to save him!

      He puts out his hand, desperate, pleading.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Please.

      Culbraith looks at the hand a BEAT.  But the letter has turned
      his heart to stone.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    You've had your answer.

      Culbraith nods to the guards.  They level their rifles, back
      MacLeod out of the hut.

911911EXT.  ANDERSONVILLE PRISON - DAY

      As MacLeod moves back to Jeffrey, sits beside him.  Jeffrey
      is breathing hard, bathed in sweat.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sorry.

      It's all he can say.  Jeffrey closes his eyes in anguish,
      knowing the doctor isn't coming, that there's no hope.

                                      JEFFREY
                    You tried.  You did what you could.

      MacLeod cradles Jeffrey, holding his head up, wipes his
      fevered brow.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It wasn't enough.

      Jeffrey winces, the poisoned flesh burning through his body
      like a hot poker.

                                      JEFFREY
                    It hurts, Mr. MacLeod!  God, it hurts!

                    You have to.

      MacLeod looks up and sees --

      CULBRAITH

      standing at the hut, hands behind his back, watching him
      coldly.

      MacLeod locks eyes with him.  On his face, sorrow for what
      he has to do -- and hate for Culbraith for making him do it. 
      He talks through his tears.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look at the sky, Jeffrey.

      Jeffrey's fevered eyes lift up, see it -- and gleam with
      light.  MacLeod's eyes are still on Culbraith.

                                      JEFFREY
                    God bless you, sir.

      MacLeod suddenly WRENCHES hard -- and breaks Jeffrey's neck. 
      Jeffrey flinches once -- then lies still in his arms, all
      pain flooding from his body forever.

      Still staring at Culbraith, MacLeod closes Jeffrey's eyes.

      Culbraith shows no expression.  He turns and steps back into
      the hut.

      MacLeod and Richie are entering, Richie still trying to make
      his argument.

                                      RICHIE
                    Maybe Culbraith thought he had to do
                    it.  You don't know what made him
                    like that.

                                      MACLEOD

                    Maybe if you talked to him, you'd
                      understand each other.  You'd find a
                    reason not to fight!

                    That's what Methos is talking about!

      MacLeod stops, turns and stares at him.

                    It's no crock.  Mac, we sat up talking
                    all night.  The guy's got this wisdom,
                    this strength...
                          (beat)
                    It was like listening to some kind
                    of saint.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He's no saint.  And I don't care how
                    old he is, he's wrong.

                                      RICHIE
                    Have you heard a word I said?  This
                    is a chance to change our lives!  To
                    live without being afraid!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Without a head.

      Richie sees he's getting nowhere, flares in frustration.

                                      RICHIE
                    Sometimes I don't get you, Mac.
                          (beat)
                    I don't get you at all.

      He turns and walks out.  MacLeod starts for the elevator,
      angrily slams the door down and slaps the button.

913913INT.  MACLEOD S LOFT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      The elevator stops.  MacLeod lifts the door -- and stops. 
      He's getting the BUZZ.  He quietly pulls his sword, enters
      the loft to find

      METHOS

      the real one, flopped on the couch with his stocking feet
      propped on the table, revealing TOES wiggling through rips
      in his socks, beer in hand.  On the floor beside him, a well-
      worn internal-frame pack, and badly worn hiking boots.  (NOTE:
      Methos no longer wears the Watcher tattoo.)

      MacLeod lowers his sword, not smiling.

                                      METHOS
                    Thought I'd make myself at home.
                          (taking a sip)
                    There's some cold ones in the fridge.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know.  It's my fridge.

                          (shrugs)
                      Yak-butter was hell on the digestion.

      Methos takes a sip of beer, and wiggles his toes.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Besides, I had all the enlightenment
                    I could use.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Too bad you didn't keep it to
                    yourself.

      Methos sees he's pissed, does a doubletake.

                                      METHOS
                    Guess I dozed off somewhere along
                    the line.  What are we talking about?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm talking about the crap you've
                    been handing Richie.

                                      METHOS
                    Ah.
                          (beat)
                    Which crap was that, exactly?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You know damn well.  Stopping
                    fighting, laying down your sword... 
                    "give peace a chance." Sound familiar?

      Methos stares a BEAT, puts the beer down.

                                      METHOS
                    So.  He's here.

      MacLeod stares.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who's here?

914914INT.  MACLEOD'S LOFT - DAY

      Methos is at the counter, a leather awl in his hand, fixing
      a tear in his boots as MacLeod looks on.

                                      METHOS
                    I never actually met the guy.  I
                    just heard rumors about him.  He's
                    been going around, spreading his
                    message to other Immortals.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (pointed)
                    Using your name.

                                      METHOS
                    It's not like I took out a patent or
                    anything.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Sounds like this guy's started a
                      franchise.

                    This line about peace and love...

                    Maybe exactly what he says.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Come on.  Turning the other cheek
                    only gets you slapped twice.

                                      METHOS
                    Still, it has a nice ring.  No
                    fighting, no killing, peace and
                      harmony...  Tell me you haven't
                      fantasized about it yourself.
                          (beat)
                    Some young suckers are sure to fall
                    for it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Richie's seen the light.

                                      METHOS
                    Voila.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He won't listen to me.  He thinks
                    the guy is some kind of prophet.

                    Who's to say he's wrong?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You are.  The man is a fraud!

                                      METHOS
                    Look, enough people want my head
                    because of who I am.  If he wants to
                    play "Methos," I say let him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And if he gets killed doing it?

                                      METHOS
                    Then nobody's going to be looking

                    They say imitation is the sincerest

      He holds up the boots.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    What happened to honest craftsmanship? 
                    I only put a thousand miles on these
                    babies.

      MacLeod pushes the boots aside.

                                      MACLEOD
                    At least talk to Richie.  Convince
                    him the guy's a fake.

                                      METHOS
                    What makes you think he'll listen to
                    me?

                                      MACLEOD
                      Because...
                          (beat)
                    You'll be so damn sincere.

      His smile says he won't take no for an answer.  Methos sighs.

                                      METHOS
                    I left Katmandu for this.

916916INT.  JOE'S - DAY

      Richie faces Methos, as MacLeod and Dawson look on.  Methos
      tries to look uninvested in the outcome.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm afraid not.

      Richie looks from Methos, to MacLeod and Dawson.

                                      RICHIE
                    This guy isn't Methos.  He's Adam
                    Pierson.

                                      METHOS
                    I was for a while.
                          (beat)
                    I gave it up.

                                      RICHIE
                    I mean, look at him.  He's way too...

                                      METHOS
                    Yes... ?

                                      RICHIE
                    Ordinary.

      Methos looks at MacLeod.

                          (shrugs)
                    Maybe I should grow a beard.

      He starts away.  MacLeod pulls him back.  Richie looks to
      Dawson for help.

                                      RICHIE
                    Help me out, Joe.  I mean, five-
                    thousand years of wisdom?  Him?

                                      DAWSON

                    But five-thousand's about right.

      Richie stares.  He's starting to feel on shaky ground.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know how you feel, Richie, but
                    what you see is what you get.
                          (beat)
                    This is the real Methos.

                    He's got a point, Mac.

      MacLeod looks to Methos, expecting him to launch into a
      convincing speech.  Instead, Methos shrugs.

                                      METHOS
                    I did my part.
                          (to MacLeod)
                    You did yours.
                          (re Richie)
                    And he's gonna believe what he wants
                    to.

                                      RICHIE

      MacLeod flares in frustration.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The message is wrong and it's going
                    to get you killed.
                          (beat)
                    Richie, you just met him.  What he's
                    saying goes against everything we
                    know.  Why would you believe him?

                                      RICHIE
                    Because he offered me his life.  Why
                    would he do that?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe he's afraid to fight.

                                      METHOS
                    Or maybe he knew you wouldn't take
                    it.

      Richie shakes his head, almost pitying the others.

                    I don't get this.  I mean, this is a
                    chance for peace...  a chance to end
                    the killing forever.

      He looks directly at MacLeod.

                    Of all the people in the world, I

      There's a beat.  MacLeod doesn't answer.  Then, abruptly --

                    I'll check out this other "Methos." 
                    Maybe something will turn up.

      Dawson heads to the back room.  Methos stands there alone.

      Wasn't all this about him?

918918INT.  CULBRAITH S HOUSE OVER THE WATER - DAY

      Culbraith is on the deck, looking out to sea.  He gets a
      BUZZ, he turns.

      It's the "other Methos."  He approaches slowly, hands raised.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Who the hell are you?

                                      MESSENGER
                    My name is Methos.

      Culbraith reacts to the name.  A myth has come to life.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    You're not real.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I think I am.

      Culbraith reaches for his sword.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    And now you're looking for me?

      Messenger smiles.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Yes...  but not for the reason you
                    think.

      He opens his coat to show he is unarmed.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    I carry no sword.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Then you're a fool.

      He steps closer.  Messenger doesn't move to defend himself.

                                      MESSENGER

                    If you kill me, we won't be able to
                    talk.

      Culbraith pauses, eyes him suspiciously.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    There's nothing to talk about.

      Culbraith is thrown by this.

                          (an edge)

                    They were hiding in a church when
                    the Union soldiers found them.  I
                    had told them about holy ground. 
                    They thought they were safe.

                    They burned the church with them in

                    You wanted to weep, but you couldn't. 
                    You wanted to raise them up, hear
                    them laugh again...  but they were
                    gone forever.

                    So you went out to kill.

                    But it didn't stop the pain.

      Culbraith shakes his head, numb.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    So you kept killing...  until you
                    couldn't remember their faces.  Your
                    wife, the children...  they were
                    gone.

                    know how to end it.

      He places a hand on Culbraith's shoulder.  Culbraith closes
      his eyes in pain.  Then --

      THE BUZZ.  Culbraith tries to recover, picking up his sword
      as

      The door BURSTS open -- MacLeod stands there, sword out,

                    Whatever he did to you, he did out

                    Yes, I knew Darius.  I know what he

      Messenger is near his porch, gardening in pots, when he gets
      the BUZZ.  He looks up -- to find the real Methos standing
      watching him with a quizzical look.

                                      METHOS
                    Methos, I presume.

      Messenger nods.

                                      MESSENGER
                    So they tell me.

                                      METHOS
                      Interesting.  I'd always heard you
                    were a myth, but you seem quite real.
                          (beat)
                    Tell me, is it true Socrates was a
                    friend of yours?

                                      MESSENGER
                    I've had many friends.

                                      METHOS
                    And I've always wondered what
                    Cleopatra was really like.

                                      MESSENGER
                    She was a woman like other women. 
                    She loved, she lived, she died.

                                      METHOS
                    Speaking of death...  You do seem
                    quite...  vulnerable.

      As he says this, he takes out his sword with studied
      casualness, examines it.  The threat is obvious, but Messenger
      doesn't react to it.

                                      MESSENGER
                    We're all vulnerable.

      Methos toys with his sword, his tone conversational.

                                      METHOS
                    More for you, I think.

                    A lot of people might want the head
                    of a five-thousand year-old man.

      He swishes the sword experimentally.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Perhaps.  But they also listen to a
                      five-thousand year-old man.

                                      METHOS
                    I suppose they would.  I mean, fifty
                    centuries must have taught you a
                    lot.  Knowledge, wisdom...  that
                    sort of thing.

                                      MESSENGER
                    That's what people think.  Truth is,
                    my beliefs are very simple.

                                      METHOS
                    Ah, yes.  I've heard about those
                    beliefs.  You really believe there's
                    no such thing as evil?

                                      MESSENGER
                    Only fear.

                                      METHOS
                    So men like Genghis Khan and Hitler
                    were only children acting out?

                                      MESSENGER
                    They were men driven by fear to commit
                    evil acts.

                                      METHOS
                          (with sarcasm)
                    And I suppose if their mothers had
                    truly loved them, the world would
                    have been different?

                                      MESSENGER
                      Perhaps...  Can you say it wouldn't?

                                      METHOS
                          (curious)
                    And you really think it's possible
                    to end "The Game?"

                                      MESSENGER
                    I believe it's worth trying.

                                      METHOS
                    Even if it costs your life?

      Messenger smiles the smile of a Gandhi.

                    nothing?  Risked nothing?  Merely
                    stayed alive?
                          (a smile)
                    It would be pointless.

      It's as if he's looking right into Methos.

                                      METHOS
                    Some might think all that experience
                    is worth saving.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    I don't think so -- but we could
                    talk about it.

      He gestures toward the garden chairs.

                    I didn't catch your name.

                                      METHOS
                    That's right.  You didn't.

      He flashes an inscrutable look, then leaves.  Messenger looks
      after him a BEAT, then returns to his flowers.

922922EXT.  MESSENGER'S SEASIDE COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY

      The Messenger is sitting there saying nothing, just looking
      at Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    What is it?

      The silence draws out.  Richie grows uncomfortable.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    I've been here for twenty minutes
                    and you haven't said a word.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Go home, Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    Why?  What'd I do?

                    Your sword.

      He smiles gently.  Richie's hand goes to it.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    It's all right.  You'll give it up
                    when the time is right.

                                      RICHIE
                    You're pissed.

                                      MESSENGER
                    No...  but I'd rather not have weapons
                    in my presence.

                                      RICHIE
                            (struggling)
                    It goes against everything I was
                    taught.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I know.

      He stands, moves around the garden.

                    The Spartans left their children on

                    We all kill because we're taught to
                    kill.  Because we fear death.

      Richie meets his eyes.

                                      RICHIE
                    Aren't you afraid to die?

                                      MESSENGER
                    Of course.  I'm not a fool.
                          (beat)
                    You wonder if that's why I'm doing
                    all this.  Because I'm afraid to
                    fight.

      He pulls a STAVE from the garden and tosses it to Richie.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Come at me.

                                      RICHIE
                    Look, I didn't mean anything...

                                      MESSENGER
                    Come at me.  Please.

      He gestures invitingly.  Richie makes a half-hearted thrust --
      Messenger dodges it easily.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    You can do better than that.

      Richie winds up, takes a serious swing.  Messenger dodges
      the stick, grabs Richie, and throws him on his ass.

      Richie, a bit nettled, picks himself up.

                                      RICHIE
                    I wasn't ready.

                          (off Richie's look)
                    Go ahead.  Strike.

      His voice is quietly commanding.  Richie hesitates, then
      takes his sword out.  Still he hesitates.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)

                    Strike!

      Richie whirls on instinct, his blade slices down --

      THE MESSENGER

      makes a miraculous move and disarms Richie.  In an instant,
      he's holding Richie's sword an inch from Richie's neck.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, but I needed to make a point.
                          (beat)
                    They say the best peacemaker is a
                    man experienced at war.  It's not
                    that I can't fight...  it's that I
                    won't kill.

      He reverses the sword and hands it back.  Richie takes it,
      humbled.

                                      RICHIE
                          (re his sword)
                    That's why you don't like them around.

                    I don't want the temptation or the
                      opportunity.  My defense is my faith.
                          (a smile)
                    So far, it's worked.

                                      RICHIE
                    Sorry I doubted you.

      Messenger turns a disapproving look on him.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Richie, don't believe because of my
                    strength.  Believe because of yours. 
                    Because you want to.

                                      RICHIE
                    But I do want to.  Why else am I
                    here?

                                      MESSENGER
                    Listen to me.  If you do this...  if
                    you join me...  you may die.  Others

                    you're sure.

      He turns and heads toward his cottage, leaving Richie there. 
      OFF Richie's look --

923923EXT.  CHURCH - ESTABLISHING - DAY

924924INT.  CHURCH - DAY

      A small church.  Richie is in a front pew, deep in thought. 
      He gets the BUZZ as MacLeod enters, walks up to sit beside
      him.  They stay that way a BEAT, then --

                                      MACLEOD
                    I thought I might find you here.

      Richie doesn't answer.  MacLeod senses his turmoil.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    It's a lot to think about.  Life,
                    death...  what it means.
                          (beat)
                    If it means anything.

      Richie nods, staring up at the stained glass windows.

                                      RICHIE
                    I want him to be right, Mac.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know.

                                      RICHIE
                          (firm)
                    I don't like killing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We've talked about this before,
                    Richie.  You're not supposed to.

      Richie looks at him.

                                      RICHIE
                    Change has to start somewhere.

                    Wouldn't you like to live your life
                    without looking over your shoulder?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes, but it's not possible.  Not in
                    this life.  There's evil in the world. 
                    Real evil.  And it's up to good men
                    to stop it.

                                      RICHIE
                    So that's it?  It's just that simple?

                                      MACLEOD
                    If it's anything, Richie, it's not
                    simple.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac...  I respect you more than anyone
                    I've ever known.  But I've got to
                    make my own decision about this.

      MacLeod places a hand on Richie's shoulder.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know you do.

      MacLeod rises and leaves Richie to ponder.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

925925EXT.  MESSENGER'S SEASIDE COTTAGE - NIGHT

      Messenger steps onto the porch, following the BUZZ.  He peers
      into the gloom --

      Culbraith steps from the shadows.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    You're not hard to find.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I don't try to be.

      Culbraith steps onto the porch.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I thought about what you said.
                          (beat)
                    About what I was.  How I came to be
                    this way.

                                      MESSENGER
                    It wasn't your choice, William.
                          (beat)
                    You were made into what you are.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    And you think I could change?

                                      MESSENGER
                    I know you could.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Only if I wanted to...  and I don't.

925CONTINUED:925

                                      MESSENGER
                    I don't believe that.

      Culbraith draws his sword.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    This is a mistake, William.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Your mistake.  I'll have the head of
                    Methos.
                          (beat)
                    This is how I am.  This is me.  I
                    can't be anything else.

      He moves closer.  Messenger draws himself up, seeming to
      gain spiritual height, strength.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I know what I saw in your heart... 
                    in your life.  I reached you.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    And this is what you found.
                          (beat)
                    Your death.

      He raises his sword.  Messenger doesn't flinch.

                                      MESSENGER
                    If this is what's in your heart, to
                    kill an unarmed man...
                          (the Messenger kneels)
                    ... who kneels before you... 
                          (beat)
                    Then I was wrong.

      He looks Culbraith in the eyes.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    But I don't believe I was wrong.

      There's enormous conviction in his eyes, his voice.  He holds
      the look for a moment -- then inclines his head.

      Culbraith looks at him kneeling there, neck exposed, waiting.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Believe this.

      Then suddenly -- Culbraith whirls and STRIKES.  And off the
      sword stroke --

                                                                              FADE OUT.96509     "The Messenger"     44.     Final Shooting Script 9/16/96

      MacLeod comes out from the kitchen area as Richie steps in
      from the elevator.  Richie's manner is tentative -- he's
      made a decision, but isn't sure how to announce it.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)

      Richie shakes his head.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Don't suppose you came for a workout
                    either.
                          (beat)
                    So.  What happens now?

      A BEAT -- and Richie takes out his sword.  He holds it a
      BEAT, finding this difficult.  This is the blade MacLeod
      gave him.  He holds it out to MacLeod, like an offering. 
      MacLeod doesn't reach for it.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Richie, think about this.

                                      RICHIE
                    I have thought about it, Mac.  As
                    much as anything else in my life.

      MacLeod still doesn't take the sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You realize what you're doing?
                          (beat)
                    These aren't just weapons, Richie. 
                    They're part of us... of what we
                    are.

                                      RICHIE
                    Not me, Mac.  It's not what I am.
                          (beat)
                    Not any more.

      MacLeod sees he's made up his mind.  Slowly, reluctantly, he
      takes the sword.  There's a ceremonial feel about this -- a
      sense of finality and sadness.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96509     "The Messenger"     46.     Final Shooting Script 9/16/96

      MacLeod just looks at him a BEAT, letting it all play on his
      face.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    We don't have to agree on this.
                          (beat)
                    I'm sorry.

      He clasps MacLeod's shoulder, then turns and heads out.

      MacLeod looks at the sword in his arms.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Me, too.

      And OFF his look --

928928INT. DOJO - OFFICE - NIGHT

      MacLeod, Dawson and Methos are gathered, drinks all around. 
      MacLeod prods his hardly touched scotch.  Methos, sitting on
      the desk near MacLeod, shrugs at what MacLeod has just told
      him.

                                      METHOS
                    So.  The Pied Piper gets another
                    one.

      Dawson gives him a look.

                                      DAWSON
                    I suppose you'd know what to do.

                                      METHOS
                    You bet.  Standard response to
                      unforeseen dilemma, developed over
                    many centuries...
                          (beat)
                    Nothing.

                                      DAWSON
                    I think I like the other Methos
                    better.

                                      METHOS
                    You asked.
                          (beat)
                    Think I'll visit the men's room. 
                    Check out the latest graffiti.

      He slides off the desk and heads up the stairs toward the
      dojo locker room.  Dawson looks after him.

                                      DAWSON
                    Is it just me, or is he really a
                    jerk sometimes?

                                      MACLEOD
                    He's right, Joe.  There's nothing to
                    do.
                          (beat)
                    It's Richie's decision.  I have to
                    respect it.

                                      DAWSON
                    Even if it gets him killed?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I taught him how to survive.  What
                    he does with that has to be up to
                    him.

      He's trying to convince himself as much as anyone else. 
      Dawson shakes his head.

                                      DAWSON
                    Some guy comes along, says
                      everything's rosy.  No more death,
                    no more fear... hell, of course Richie
                    went for it.
                          (beat)
                    But this mistake's gonna cost him,
                    Mac.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's his to make.  It's a question
                    of integrity.

      As he says this, Methos returns.

                                      METHOS
                    There was this Spanish guy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You got all that from the locker

                                      DAWSON
                    So what happened?

                                      METHOS
                      Allejandro?  Died in screaming agony,
                    of course.
                          (pointed, to MacLeod)
                    But he kept his integrity.

      MacLeod puts his drink down with a sigh.  He throws Methos a
      look.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let yourselves out.

      He rises and leaves.  Dawson turns and looks at Methos.

                                      DAWSON
                    You are on calculating sonofabitch.

                                      METHOS
                    Thank you.  It's all a matter of
                      anticipation.

                                      DAWSON
                    Really.  Here, have one on me.

      He lifts a brimming glass -- and TIPS it onto Methos' lap. 
      Methos jumps up, drenched.

                                      METHOS
                    What the hell was that?!

                                      DAWSON
                    Just one of those unforeseen dilemmas.
                          (beat)
                    Surprised you didn't anticipate it.

      And OFF this --

929929EXT.  MESSENGER'S SEASIDE COTTAGE - NIGHT

      Richie arrives.  He starts up the steps, hearing the steady
      SQUEAK of Messenger's rocking chair.  He reaches the porch --
      and stops.  Instead of the Messenger, Culbraith sits there,
      rocking quietly.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Didn't mean to surprise you.
                          (beat)
                    I never thanked you for saving me.

      Richie feels a twinge of hesitation, but his newfound
      conviction overcomes it.  He moves up toward Culbraith.

                                      RICHIE
                    It's what he teaches.

      He means the Messenger.  Culbraith nods.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Never met anyone quite like the old
                    man.  It's hard to believe he lived
                    so long without a sword.
                          (beat)
                    How are you managing it?

                                      RICHIE
                    Faith can take you a long way.
                          (beat)
                    You?

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Me?
                          (beat)
                    I'm afraid I had no faith.

      He rises and his sword is in his hand.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    No faith at all.

      Richie backs off as Culbraith advances.

                                      RICHIE
                    Don't.  You know this is wrong!

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Is it?  I guess old habits die hard.

      Richie is backing away, talking desperately.

                                      RICHIE
                    But he saved your life!  Didn't you
                    listen to him?!

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Right up to the end.
                          (curious)
                    Are you going to make it as easy as
                    he did...  or put up a fight?

      Richie stares in horror.

                                      RICHIE
                    All he wanted was to save us!  To
                    stop the killing!

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Only one problem, son.
                          (beat)
                    I came to like the killing.

      He SWINGS.  Richie dodges, and the sword strikes the chair,
      splintering it.  Richie turns and vaults off the porch, into
      the darkness.

      Culbraith moves after Richie.

930930EXT.  BEACH - NEAR MESSENGER'S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

      Richie scrambles along the beach, Culbraith right after him. 
      Richie grabs a length of WOOD RAILING, and brandishes it.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Putting up a fight.
                          (beat)
                    I guess when you get down to it,
                    we're all the same.

                                      RICHIE
                    Not all of us.  He wasn't.

      Culbraith swings -- and cuts the wood in two.  His next slice
      catches Richie's chest.

      Richie stumbles back in the sand, wounded, and angry.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    You bastard!

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (approving)
                    That's the spirit.  We were made for
                    war.

      He raise his sword to take Richie's head -- and gets the
      BUZZ.  He hesitates, sword aloft, not turning.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    The battle's been joined.  You can't
                      interfere.

      MacLeod stands there.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I wouldn't think of it.

      He unfolds his arms to reveal Richie s SWORD.  He tosses it.

      ON THE SWORD

      catching the light as it arcs through the air.

      RICHIE

      catches it and lunges forward with three fast, hard blows,
      forcing Culbraith backwards.

      Culbraith goes to his knees.  He looks up with cold defiance,
      knowing he's finished.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Is this the part where I beg for
                    mercy?  Or where you tell me we don't
                    have to do this?

                                      RICHIE
                    Neither.

      He swings, and Culbraith falls.  As the QUICKENING strikes,
      logs ignite, and fire swirls up into the sky.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

931931INT.  MACLEOD'S LOFT - DAY

      MacLeod and Methos are there.  Richie leans against the
      counter, looking somber and drained.  He's been through an
      emotional wringer.

                                      RICHIE
                    I don't even know what his real name
                    was.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Does it matter?

      Richie shakes his head.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm sorry he's gone.  Maybe he wasn't
                    Methos.  Maybe he wasn't right...
                          (beat)
                    But he was good.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes, he was.
                          (in earnest)
                    And for a moment you thought...  you
                    hoped real peace for us was possible.
                          (off Richie's nod)
                    Me too.

      Methos stands with a self-deprecating shrug.

                                      METHOS
                    Sorry, I'm not what you imagined,
                    kid.

                                      RICHIE
                    It's okay.

                                      METHOS
                    Later.

      Methos starts to leave.

                                      RICHIE
                    Got any words of wisdom for me, old
                    timer?

      As Methos leaves, he turns back.

                                      METHOS
                    Nope.

      He's gone.

      Richie turns to MacLeod, extends his hand.

                                      RICHIE
                    Well, thanks for saving my life.
                          (with a smile)
                    Again.

      MacLeod takes it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You won the fight.  I just leveled
                    the playing field.

      Richie moves to the door.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm gonna get on the bike and head
                    out for a while.  Try to figure out
                    some things.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Those big questions.
                          (off Richie s nod)
                    Even if you don't find the answers,
                    keep looking.

      Richie nods and starts to leave.  MacLeod calls after him.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)

                          (Richie turns)
                    Take care.

      As Richie smiles and nods --

                                                                              FADE OUT.
