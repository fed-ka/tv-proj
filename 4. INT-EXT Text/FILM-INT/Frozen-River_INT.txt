A sign reads "Bridge to Canada."
A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St.
Lawrence River.
Cars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs
officials inspect and question impatient drivers.
Beyond them a smaller sign: "THANK YOU FOR VISITING
MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for
you".

She looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized
RENTAWORLD furniture including a big screen TV.
An enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her
eye. In it, her husband, TROY, SR., 40, wearing a forced
smile, his long, shaggy hair combed flat for the picture.
Ray hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off
her bathrobe -- she has several tatoos -- and slides into
a pair or jeans and a t-shirt.
5.
A sleepy-eyed, toe-headed boy, RICKY, 5, walks in,
shirtless in pajama bottoms, eyes shining.
RICKY
Is it here?
Ray stops what she's doing when she sees him and kneels
down.
RAY
Hey, little sleepy head.
RICKY
Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready.
He drags a suitcase full of plastic dinosaurs around the
corner.
The RUMBLE OUTSIDE GROWS LOUDER. Ricky BOLTS out of the
bedroom and down the hall to the trailer door.
RAY
Wait a sec-
He bursts into the yard where:

Ray helps Ricky into his clothes and puts his backpack on
his back.
RICKY
Where's daddy?
Ray and T.J. look at each other.
RAY
He'll be back.
T.J.
Aren't we even gonna look for him?
RAY
No! I'm going to work and you're going to
school.
T.J.
That's it?
9.
RAY
The only thing that changed is that your
dad started gambling again. Everything
else is the same.
RICKY
Where did he go?
RAY
He had to take a business trip.
T.J. rolls his eyes.
T.J.
Aren't you even gonna look for him?
RAY
And miss a day of work? No. Not again.
We just have to live our lives. Now go
get your backpack.
T.J. stares, sullen.
RAY (CONT'D)
Go on!
RICKY
When is daddy coming home?
RAY
I don't know, Ricky.
T.J.
I can't believe you're not even gonna
look for him.
RAY
Where? Where do I look? (He can't answer)
T.J.
The reservation.
RAY
I told you, he could be in Atlantic City
by now.
She helps Ricky get his backpack on and gives him a kiss.
T.J.
(shakes his head)
The glove compartment. That's so stupid.
RAY
You're going to school.
10.
He follows Ricky out the door to catch the school bus
rolling up out front.
Suddenly, Ray remembers:
RAY (CONT'D)
Wait, wait.
They turn around. She digs in her pockets.
RAY (CONT'D)
Here. Lunch money.
They take it and keep running for the bus.
Ray looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes. She
takes out her second to last one. She lights it and takes
out her mascara.
She tries to put it on the bathroom mirror, but her tears
keep getting in the way.

RAY stacks shelves with a knock-off version of plastic
"My Little Pony" in a messy aisle of boxes.
MATT, 22, her boss, bone thin with bad skin walks by.
RAY
(soft)
Matt. Could I talk to you?
He looks at her.
RAY (CONT'D)
I need to come on full-time.
Matt blinks with a blank expression then:
MATT
I see you as a short timer.
RAY
What is that?
MATT
A short timer. Not here for long, not
really committed.
Ray follows him to the stock room.
11.
RAY
When I started you said it would be six
months before I could come on full-time.
And that was two years ago.
He opens a can of RED BULL and takes a sip.
MATT
It's my opinion.
RAY
Well, I mean, you know, I do show up.
Pat's late everyday. She's late now.
She's always late.
He stares blankly at her. She can think of nothing else
to say. He walks out.
Ray resumes unpacking ponies.
A moment later PAT, 22, rushes in, looking sorry. As Pat
hangs up her coat, Ray glimpses a tatoo just above her
low riding pants with the words "How You Doin'?".
Ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and
heads out the back door.
RAY (CONT'D)
See ya' tomorrow.

ROUTE 37 - DAY
8
Ray drives down a two-lane highway. It is empty flat land
but for a few trailer homes and barns.
She passes a lonely sign: "BRIDGE TO CANADA."
Up ahead another sign: "AKWESASNE LAND OF THE MOHAWK."
From the car, the Reservation consists of shabby houses
with no siding, tax-free gas stations and dive bars with
homemade signs. Ray slows a little to check out the
parking lots scanning for her husband's car.
Up ahead she sees a sign: "WOLF MART TAX FREE GAS AND
CIGARETTES.

10
Ray continues down the highway through the reservation.
She comes to a huge warehouse, the "MOHAWK BINGO PALACE."
She glances over at the sea of cars surrounding it. At
the end of a row she spots it: a BLUE ACCLAIM.
Ray abruptly turns in.

DAY
12
A SHORT, CHUBBY MOHAWK TICKET TAKER in her 60s, with
piercing blue eyes and missing teeth sits perched on a
metal chair beside a velvet rope.
TICKET TAKER
Sunrise session is almost over. Next
session starts at 10:30.
RAY
I just need to look inside.
Ray starts to walks toward the door and the ticket taker
sticks out her foot.
TICKER TAKER
It's $5 dollars for admission.
14.
RAY
I don't want to play, I just need to look
around for a second.
TICKET TAKER
I'm gonna need the five.
RAY
I'll stand right here at the door. I
won't even go inside. I just need to see
if my husband's in there.
TICKET TAKER
You still gotta pay admission.
RAY
He's gambling away the money for our
house.
TICKET TAKER
What does he look like?
RAY
Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.
TICKET TAKER
He's not in there.
RAY
Can I just look?
TICKET TAKER
I told you, lady, he's not in there.
Ray walks away. The ticket taker watches her.

Lila sits on an army cot in the dingy camper next to a
lamp on the floor. Her clothes are scattered among empty
Pringles cans.
RAY (O.S.)
(tentative, controlled)
Troy? Versales says as long as we get the
money in by Christmas we won't lose the
deposit. (pause) I think we need to talk
about this, so come on out.(Pause) Troy?
Troy?
16
17
The shock of the blast throws Lila off the cot. She looks
at the SMOKING HOLE.
RAY (O.S.)
I'm not kidding, honey, come on out.
17.
18
20
Ray drives with one hand and holds the gun with the
other. It is pointed at Lila in the passenger seat.
LILA
Turn up there.
RAY
Where?
LILA
Where that stump is.
20.
Ray makes the turn with one hand and the car bounces
through an overgrown path in the woods. Ray reaches the
stump.
RAY
(nervous)
There's no road.
LILA
There's a path.
Ray hesitates.
LILA (CONT'D)
It's not far.
Ray turns and drives into deeper woods. The gun jiggles
around in Ray's hand as they bounce along between the
trees.
Lila tries to ignore it.
21
22
Ray looks out at the ice. Tire tracks make a path across
the snow-covered surface between carefully set out CUT
EVERGREEN TREES.
LILA
Not too fast. There's ruts.
RAY
I'm not crossing that!
LILA
Don't worry they already put out the
Christmas trees. There's no black ice.
RAY
That's Canada.
LILA
No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both
sides of the river.
RAY
What about the border patrol?
21.
LILA
There's no border.
RAY
I'm still not crossing that.
LILA
Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've
seen semis cross it.
Ray looks at Lila suspiciously.
LILA (CONT'D)
The only other way is the Cornwall bridge
and they won't let you take that. (points
at the gun).
Suddenly, A TRUCK driven by a MOHAWK TEENAGER ROARS out
of the woods and SWERVES around the Acclaim FISHTAILING
then SPEEDING out across the ice.
LILA (CONT'D)
They plow it and everything.
Cautiously, Ray lets off the brake and rolls down the
boat ramp towards the smooth surface of the river.
RAY
(under her breath)
This is so fuckin' stupid.
LILA
Not too fast, there are ruts.
23
24
Ray stares straight ahead clutching the wheel, barely
breathing. Lila glances at the gun in Ray's hand, then
out at the river, unfazed.
They reach the midpoint of the river and pass it
silently.
LILA
You gotta pick up some speed to get up
the bank.
22.
Ray speeds up. The Acclaim bounces up the steep bank.
LILA (CONT'D)
It's just on the other side of those
trees.
25
25
Ray and Lila pull into a used-car lot surrounded by a
chain link fence. There is no sign of life. Ray stops.
LILA
Honk the horn.
Ray honks.
Suddenly, from under a gutted truck, A HUGE BLACK DOG,
part wolf, SPRINGS onto the hood of the Acclaim.
Ray is pinned against her seat at the sight of the dog.
Lila GRABS the gun out of her hand and points it at Ray.
LILA (CONT'D)
Just keep your mouth shut.
Ray stares at the snarling dog.
LILA (CONT'D)
Just keep it shut. Okay?
Ray nods never taking her eyes off the dog.
Lila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out
of sight.
Out of the garage comes JIMMY, 33, a stocky Mohawk,
eating a sandwich.
Jimmy looks suspiciously at Ray before he sees Lila.
Thunder growls.
JIMMY
Thunder! SHUT UP!.
The dog GROWLS ferociously at Ray.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
Get back under there!
Thunder jumps off the hood and disappears back under the
trunk.
23.
Jimmy walks around to the passenger side of the car. Lila
rolls down her window.
LILA
Hi, Jimmy.
Jimmy glances at Ray.
JIMMY
He don't like whites, Lila.
LILA
Sorry.
JIMMY
And your late.
LILA
Sorry.
JIMMY
I shouldn't even be dealing with you.
LILA
I know. Sorry.
He hands her a paper bag.
Jimmy goes back to the garage and opens the door. TWO
YOUNG CHINESE MEN in cheap jogging suits follow him out,
looking around.
26
26
Lila hands the paper bag to Ray and points the gun at
her, keeping it low and out of sight.
LILA
Count it.
RAY
What's going on here?
LILA
Just count it.
Ray opens the bag. It's full of cash. All fifties and
hundreds. Ray counts it.
LILA (CONT'D)
How much is there?
24.
RAY
Twelve hundred.
Lila opens the glove compartment and presses the trunk
release.
Jimmy motions to the Chinese men to get in the trunk.
Jimmy shuts it.
He taps twice on the hood of the car and walks back to
the garage.
LILA
(to Ray)
Let's go.
RAY
Wait, who the fuck are they?
LILA
Just back up.
RAY
I'm not moving until those people get out
of my trunk.
LILA
I'll give you half. Now let's go.
Jimmy turns around, sees the two women arguing and gets
suspicious.
LILA (CONT'D)
Let's go!
RAY
I'm not taking them over the border.
That's a crime.
LILA
There's no border here. This is free
trade between nations.
RAY
This isn't a nation.
Lila jams the gun into Ray's side.
LILA
(under her breath)
Let's go.
Jimmy starts back toward the car. Ray puts the car in
REVERSE and backs up.
25.
27
28
Ray drives. Lila sits angled toward Ray with the gun
trained on her.
LILA
Why'd your husband leave you?
RAY
Fuck you.
LILA
Maybe he wanted a younger women.
Ray stares out at the ice.
LILA (CONT'D)
That's what usually happens.
Ray says nothing.
LILA (CONT'D)
I never have to worry about that. My
husband is dead. Went down in the river
on a run. They never found him. Probably
tangled in river weeds.
She gives Ray a spooky look.
LILA (CONT'D)
You better slow down there are ruts out
here. You could get stuck in one.
Ray speeds up and roars up the boat ramp off the ice
skidding a little.
29
30
Ray slows down at the sign.
LILA
Keep going.
RAY
What if the troopers stop us.
LILA
They won't stop you. You're white.
Ray keeps going.
31
33
Ray sees the Dealer hurrying towards them.
LILA
Pull around back then wait for him to
come to the window.
Lila keeps the gun low.
The Dealer approaches cautiously.
LILA (CONT'D)
Roll down your window.
He walks up slowly and hands her a brown paper bag.
LILA (CONT'D)
Count it.
Ray opens the bag and counts out the cash, as before.
RAY
Twelve hundred.
27.
Lila takes the cash from Ray and pops the trunk release.
The two Chinese men hurry out. The Dealer ushers them
into a Garage.
LILA
Let's go.
34
34
Ray and Lila return down Route 37 past the sign
"AKWESASNE, LAND OF THE MOHAWK"
Lila keeps the gun on Ray.
LILA
Turn down there.
Ray looks at the dirt road leading into the woods.
LILA (CONT'D)
Stop here.
Ray stops.
LILA (CONT'D)
Now open the door.
Ray hesitates. Lila jams the gun in her side.
LILA (CONT'D)
Open the door.
Ray opens the door.
LILA (CONT'D)
Now get out.
Ray doesn't move.
RAY
You can't have my car.
LILA
Get out.
RAY
You can't have my car.
Lila tries to push Ray out the driver's door with her
feet.
Ray clings to the steering wheel.
28.
RAY (CONT'D)
No!
Suddenly, Ray grabs Lila by the hair and pulls her head
down to the car seat. Lila hits Ray in the head with the
gun.
RAY (CONT'D)
(gasps)
Fuckin' bitch!
Bleeding and holding Lila's hair, Ray pries the gun out
of Lila's hand. Lila grabs the sack of money, jumps out
of the passenger side of the car and takes off into the
woods.
Ray chases her, but Lila is faster and gets ahead, then
disappears into the woods. Ray stops, panting, and wipes
the blood from her forehead.
RAY (CONT'D)
(calls after her)
Little bitch!
Ray stares after her for a long moment then gets back in
the Acclaim.
35
37
Ray wakes up with Ricky staring at her.
RICKY
Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna
happen to the tin crapper when we get our
new house?
RAY
(half asleep)
They're gonna flatten it out and send it
to China.
RICKY
Then what?
RAY
They're gonna melt it down and make
little toys out if it.
RICKY
Then what?
RAY
They'll send them back here so I can sell
them at All for a Dollar.
RICKY
And you can buy me some?
RAY
That's right.
RICKY
Yes!
33.
38
38
Ray puts out a breakfast spread of Microwave popcorn and
tang.
T.J.
I'm not eatin' that again for dinner.
RAY
We just have to make it to my paycheck on
Friday.
T.J.
What about Rentacenter?
She searches through the couch cushions.
RAY
What about them?
T.J.
They said they're coming to get the
furniture if they don't get a payment by
4 o'clock.
RAY
You told me that already.
She finds change and hands it to him.
RAY (CONT'D)
Here, lunch money.
She gives the rest to Ricky.
T.J.
Look I don't see why you won't just let
me get a job with Mitch.
RAY
(to T.J.)
Who's Mitch.
T.J.
He's got like this whole business he
runs.
RAY
He sells pot to kids?
T.J.
No, it's computers. He works on
computers.
34.
RAY
You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so
forget it.
T.J.
That's so stupid. We're gonna lose the TV
while I'm sitting in some Christmas
assembly when I could be-
RAY
Your job is looking after your brother.
Who's gonna take care of him?
T.J.
(going out the door)
I still say we should go back to the rez,
get the Horizon and kick some serious
butt.
T.J. goes out the door behind Ricky and slams it in Ray's
face.
Ray slips into her jeans and goes to the bathroom mirror
to put on her mascara. She cakes it on trying to ignore
the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it. Finally she
stops and stares at herself.
CUT TO:

40
Lila is asleep next to a rattling propane heater.
RAY (O.S.)
(knocks with the gun)
You hear me!
Lila's eyes pop open but she stays perfectly still. Ray
shakes the door handle.
RAY (CONT'D)
I want my part.
Lila sits up on her cot and puts on her jacket.
RAY (CONT'D)
I want my part.
LILA
I'll give you the money if you give me
the car.
RAY
No way.
LILA
The money's gone.
RAY
Then I wanna get some more of those
Chinese.
The door opens. Ray steps back holding the gun. They look
at each other.
LILA
It's gonna cost me to get that hole
fixed. I froze last night.
Ray holds up her hair revealing the cut over her eye.
RAY
I just need enough for the balloon
payment on my doublewide then I'm out of
this. I'm no criminal.
LILA
It's not a crime.
RAY
You people can call it what you want to.
I just want my double.
36.
They stand staring at each other for a long moment, then
Ray walks over and unties the rope around the bumpers of
the Acclaim and the Horizon.
LILA
I don't usually work with whites.
RAY
Suit yourself.
Ray gets in the driver's side of the Acclaim and starts
it. After a moment, Lila gets in the passenger side.
41
43
Lila rolls up the window.
RAY
What's going on?
LILA
We gotta pick them up.
38.
RAY
(hesitates)
Where?
LILA
Not far.
RAY
Where's that?
LILA
An old casino through the woods. They
used to have gambling there in the
bootlegger days.
44
DAY
45
Ray drives across the river. The socks and shoes are
between them.
RAY
Why would they want to run?
LILA
To get away from the snakeheads.
40.
RAY
What's that?
LILA
The snakeheads pay to get them here and
then they gotta work off what they owe .
RAY
How much does it cost?
LILA
Forty, fifty thousand. Depends where
they're coming from.
RAY
To get here?
LILA
Sometimes they gotta work for years to
pay it off.
RAY
(disbelief)
To get here? No fuckin' way.
She gets a whiff of the socks.
RAY (CONT'D)
God those are ripe.
She throws them into the backseat.
LILA
They always stink.
Two more cars are seen coming toward them on the river.
They swerve wide to avoid the Acclaim.
She speeds up to make it up the boat launch.
46
46
Ricky watches cartoons on the big screen TV. T.J. flips
through the telephone book to the back section: AKWESASNE
and scans columns of names mostly either "BONAPARTE"
"LITTLEWOLF" or "THREERIVERS". He chooses a name and
dials the number.
T.J.
-Hello (in a grown-up voice) Is this Mrs.
Irene ThreeRivers?
-Mrs. Bonaparte, I have good news.
(MORE)
41.
T.J. (CONT'D)
-I'm the business manager of Mr. E.F.
ThreeRivers and I have been authorized to
inform you that you have inherited money.
-Are you still there?
-Wait, I don't WANT any money, I want to
GIVE you money.
-That's right. You have inherited money
from his computer fortune.
-He was the second richest man next to
Bill Gates.
-He left you Twenty-six thousand seven
hundred and fifty dollars.(pause)
-TWENTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND
FIFTY DOLLARS!
-Oh no, you have no obligation
whatsoever, Mrs. ThreeRivers, just a
small processing fee of 29.00 dollars
will authorize me to send out your first
payment of thirteen-thousand three
hundred and seventy five dollars.
-You can put it on any major credit card.
(pause) Of course, you can always refuse
the money.
-Sure, I can hold.
T.J. holds his pen poised to write and looks at Ricky
watching TV, then at the clock. It reads 3:40 PM.
47
49
Ray notices the vehicle.
RAY
Are they always there?
42.
LILA
Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you
give them a reason.
RAY
Have you ever gotten caught?
LILA
Once.
RAY
What happened?
LILA
They gave me the choice of paying a fine
or spending three months in jail.
RAY
What did you do?
LILA
I paid the fine. I made the money back in
two nights of smuggling. But back then it
was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some
of the troopers were into it, too.
RAY
Smuggling?
LILA
Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on
cigarettes in Canada most people got out
of it and the rest switched over to
Chinese.
50
51
Ray takes the money.
LILA
Count it.
RAY
Right, I know.
43.
LILA
Well, be sure it's right. I don't wanna
get stiffed.
RAY
Then why don't you count it?
LILA
I got bad eyes.
She counts it and nods at Lila. Lila POPS the trunk and
the barefoot Chinese men get out. Ray and Lila look at
them, they look back, blank and ungrateful.
Ray rolls down the window and tosses out their shoes and
socks.
RAY
You're welcome.
Ray swerves back out onto Route 37.
52
54
Ricky is glued to a cartoon. T.J. watches him, checking
out the window every few seconds for Ray.
A long moment passes with only the sounds from the
cartoon.
55
56
Near the river, smoke curls from the chimney of a modest
house.
Lila perches in a tree nearby with a can of Pringles
potato chips dropping every other one on the ground below
where a huge WHITE DOG, part wolf, takes his share.
46.
From the tree Lila looks inside the window of the house
where:
A baby boy, "LITTLE JAKE," about a year old, bangs his
spoon on his high chair tray then throws it down.
EVELYN LITTLEWOLF, 48, a tall thin Mohawk woman with long
hair pulled back, picks it up and gives it back to him.
He throws it again. She knows the game. She gives it
back, but the third time she holds it just out of his
reach and laughs at him. He bangs his fists on the tray.
Lila drinks in the sight.
Abruptly, the DOOR OPENS and EVELYN leans out.
EVELYN
Chance! Chance, get in here before you
freeze your ass off.
The White Dog looks up at Lila who shakes the Pringles
can upside down to show it's empty.
Chance goes inside. The door SHUTS behind him.
Lila stuffs a wad of cash in the can and jumps down from
the tree. She leaves it near the front door and hurries
into the woods.

Ray tucks Ricky into the bottom bunk. The wind whines in
the loose siding. Ray stuffs a blanket around the window
to block the draft.
58

Ray walks through the kitchen now full of groceries and
opens a can of Adirondack Cola. The remains of two
Hungry Man dinners sit on the table.
She sits down in the living room. T.J. watches the local
weather.
47.
WEATHER MAN (O.S.)
Temps will dip tonight and tomorrow.
Expect a Clipper from Northern Ontario to
bring 8 to 12 inches of snow and winds
gusting 25-45 miles an hour making it
feel like minus 30. Area farmers are
advised to bring in livestock. More on
this after a message.
A blaring TV commercial for the "HOT WHEELS TECH TRAX AIR
STUNT CHALLENGE SET" comes on.
T.J.
That's what he wants.
RAY
What?
He points at the TV.
T.J.
For Christmas.
RAY
What is it, again?
T.J.
(recites it quick)
Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt Challenge
Set.
RAY
-Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what?
T.J.
Air-Stunt-Challenge-Set.
RAY
I got something even better than that.
T.J.
What?
RAY
The double wide. But don't mention it to
Ricky, just in case.
T.J.
Yeah, "just in case."
RAY
This time is for real.
48.
T.J.
Is that why you bought Calgon Bath Stuff?
RAY
Yes it is. We're getting a tub, T.J. It's
gonna happen.
T.J.
Yeah, right.
RAY
If you keep that attitude I'll never let
you use it.
T.J.
Be afraid. Be very afraid. (a moment)
What about Dad?
RAY
What about him?
T.J.
What are you gonna do?
RAY
Why, did he call broke yet?
T.J.
No, but maybe he would call if you
weren't so bitter.
RAY
Oh, here we go again with Saint Dad.
T.J.
That's what I mean. You're always on him.
"Where's your paycheck, do you need a
meeting, give me your receipts."
RAY
He's an addict, T.J.
T.J.
You're still bitter.
RAY
You gotta help Ricky get the tree up
tomorrow after school okay?
T.J.
Where are you going?
RAY
Christmas shopping.

NIGHT

Ray lays down her bed and checks her cell phone for new
messages: a little zero blinks at her.
She listens to her own cell phone message,
RAY'S VOICE
Hi, it's me. leave a message, and maybe
I'll call ya back.
It is harsh. She erases it and tries again.
RAY
(fake cheerful)
Hi....it's me...leave a message and I'll
call ya' back.
She plays it back. It sounds fake. She tries again.
RAY (CONT'D)
(less cheerful, forced)
Hey, leave me a message and I'll call ya'
back. (under her breath) You son of a
bitch.
She plays it back. "You son of a..." was recorded.
She tries again.
RAY (CONT'D)
Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right
now, but if it's you, Troy, please at
least tell me you are alive, because the
boys are worried about you.
She brings up OLD MESSAGES on her cell phone and listens
to one.
TROY (O.S.)
Hey, I just got done here. I made two
hours overtime fixing one of the snow-
making machines. Pretty cool, huh? I'll
be home late. I'm gonna catch that
meeting at 7:30. Love you, bye.
Ray stares across the room at a pile of Troy's dirty
flannel shirts. She gets up and picks up the pile to move
it to the closet, but feels something hard. From a shirt
pocket she pulls out a stack of used scratch cards.
She throws the shirts in the closet and reaches for her
cigarettes.
50.
She takes out a glossy picture of her double wide dream
home, "The Commodore" a gleaming pre-fab structure with
a landscaped yard and a family with paid-for smiles.
After a moment she takes the wad of cash out of her
pocket and begins making stacks of fifties and twenties.
60
DAY
61
Lila is sound asleep on her cot under three blankets next
to the propane heater.
Bernie's snow balls THUMP against the side of the camper.
BERNIE (O.S.)
Lila! Get up.
Lila opens her eyes and looks out the window, squinting
at the snow glare.
BERNIE (CONT'D)
They got two people out sick today, so if
you get down there you got the job.
LILA
Huh?
BERNIE
Get dressed, I got coffee. Let's go!
He holds up a paper cup.
She slips on her jeans with a sweatshirt...
62
DAY
63
Bernie hands her a paper cup of coffee.
BERNIE
Rita said you quit.
LILA
She fired me.
BERNIE
That's not what she said.
LILA
Well, she should have. I can't see to
count the money. I told you that. I come
up short half the time.
BERNIE
Then get some glasses.
LILA
They make me carsick.
BERNIE
Gimme a break.
She sips the coffee.
LILA
So where are we going?
BERNIE
The Tribal Council needs someone to
answer phones.
LILA
No way!
She reaches for the door handle.
BERNIE
Why not? You can answer a phone, can't
you?
52.
LILA
Not there! Not with them.
She starts to get out. He notices the Horizon, buried
under the snow, near the camper.
BERNIE
(suspicious)
What's that?
LILA
I bought it.
BERNIE
From who?
LILA
Some white lady.
He says nothing. Taps his thumbs on the steering wheel,
suspicious. A long moment passes.
LILA (CONT'D)
What?
BERNIE
What do you need a car for?
LILA
To get to work. So I don't have to walk
in the breakdown lane. Last week I almost
got hit by the plow.
BERNIE
You'll live. And you know what I'm
talking about.
LILA
It doesn't have a trunk.
He stares at straight ahead.
LILA (CONT'D)
All right, all right! I'll go.
64
DAY
64
Ray rings up a counter full of merchandise for a heavyset
CUSTOMER in her 20s.
RAY
That's $87.50.
53.
The customer hands her a credit card.
Ray processes the credit card. It is declined.
RAY (CONT'D)
Sorry. Didn't go through.
The customer looks up with exaggerated annoyance.
RAY (CONT'D)
(in a low voice)
I can try to put it though again.
The customer grabs her purse from the basket, and walks
out the door, leaving the merchandise.
CUSTOMER
(yells back at Ray)
You got a problem with your machine,
lady!
Ray moves the merchandise aside for the next customer.
It is Trooper Napoli.
Ray is startled to see him. He puts down some shaving
cream and a diet Pepsi.
RAY
(rings him up)
That'll be three seventy six.
He digs in his pocket.
TROOPER
I got exact.
He counts it out. She hands him his bag and watches him
walk out.
65
65
Mohawk paintings and a huge wolf carved out of wood
decorate the waiting area.
Nearby is an office marked "GRAND CHIEF"
A MOHAWK WOMAN walks by the desk and recognizes Lila,
then looks away, quickly.
A tall, middle-aged woman, GRAND CHIEF ROSALIE comes out
of the office and walks up to Lila.
54.
ROSALIE
Do I have any messages?
Lila hands her a stack. She takes them and walks away,
then stops.
ROSALIE (CONT'D)
I can't read this.
She holds the message out to Lila. Lila tries to read it,
squinting.
LILA
I think it's a "T.".
ROSALIE
No, I can't read any of it.
LILA
I told Bernie I couldn't see.
Lila grabs her jean jacket.
LILA (CONT'D)
Nevermind. I'll go.
She walks out.
66
66
Ray pulls up in heavy snow. Lila gets in with a gallon of
windshield wiper fluid.
LILA
We gotta get extra fluid.
RAY
I gotta get back before KMART closes.
LILA
What for?
RAY
I got nothing for under the tree.
67
67
Ray fills the car with gas.
55.
Lila goes inside to get some Pringles. Looking into the
small restaurant she sees Evelyn Littlewolf, her mother -
in-law and Little Jake sitting at a table with Grand
Chief Rosalie.
She stops dead in her tracks at the sight. They do not
see her.
Slowly, she walks up to the table.
Little Jake notices her first.
ANGLE: Through the window Ray catches sight of Lila
standing at the table perfectly still.
The other women glance up at her then turn away. No one
speaks.
Lila walks off with Little Jake still watching her.
68
ACCLAIM JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - NIGHT
70
Ray and Lila drive up. Jimmy runs out with his jacket
pulled over his head. He sees Lila and signals to the
garage.
Two figures start toward the car. As they get closer, Ray
sees a man and a woman. Both Pakistani.
RAY
Wait. They're not Chinese.
LILA
They're "Pakis."
RAY
What does that mean?
LILA
They're from Pakistan.
RAY
Well where's that?
57.
LILA
I don't know. What difference does it
make?
RAY
A big difference.
The Pakistani couple stand outside the car, shivering and
holding out the cash. The man carries a heavy duffle bag.
Ray rolls down the car window. The man holds out money to
Ray but she doesn't take it.
LILA
If we wait much longer we won't be able
to get back across the river.
RAY
Look, I'm not driving just anybody across
the border.
LILA
Do you want the money or not?
RAY
I wanna know what's in the bag.
Ray looks out the car window and points to the bag
speaking loudly.
RAY (CONT'D)
What's in there?
The man looks at the woman.
LILA
They don't understand you.
RAY
Well, if they want to come over here so
bad, they ought'a take the time to learn
English.
Lila pops open the trunk.
RAY (CONT'D)
Just hold on a second.
Ray gets out.
58.
71
72
Ray and Lila get back in the car. Ray starts to count the
money. Lila takes it back.
LILA
We don't have time.
73
74
Lila struggles to count the money by the light of the
glove compartment.
LILA
Is that a two or a five?
59.
RAY
(glances down)
A five.
Ray creeps along straining to see out the windshield. The
windshield fluid peters out.
RAY (CONT'D)
Shit!
Lila looks up. Outside is a wall of white.
LILA
You gotta stop so I can fill up the wiper
fluid.
RAY
I'm not stoppin'.
LILA
It's a hundred feet deep out here if we
get on black ice
Ray sticks her head out the window but the snow and the
wind are too strong. She stops.
Lila gets out with the wiper fluid. Ray pops the hood.
Ray looks in the backseat at the duffel bag. She
hesitates a moment then reaches into the back and opens
the back passenger door and slides the bag out of the
car.
Lila gets back inside.
LILA (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
RAY
Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't
tell what they might have in there. I'm
not gonna be responsible for that.
Ray tries the windshield wipers. Fluid clears the
windshield.
Ray dials her cell phone with one hand.
RAY (CONT'D)
-Hi, I'm gonna be a little late.(pause)
-I have to work. Is Ricky asleep?
-Put him on. (pause)
-Ricky listen to me, he's not coming
until you go to sleep. (pause)
(MORE)
60.
RAY (CONT'D)
-No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over
Canada okay? He's not even done with
Canada yet, so he's not coming until you
get to sleep. Now put your brother on.
-I'll be home in a little while, okay?
-No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it
called again?
-Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever,
right, right, I'll get it if I can!
-I can't promise T.J.
-There are more important things to get
for Christmas this year. Be home in a
little while. Okay, bye.
RAY (CONT'D)
(to Lila)
You'd think a new house would be enough.
Ray guns it up the boat launch to the shore.
75
NIGHT
75
In the living room, the artificial Christmas tree is up.
The TV is on and Ricky is untangling a ball of red
Christmas lights.
T.J.
(dials the phone)
-Hi, is Mitch there? (a long pause)
The microwave dings. Holding the phone, T.J. takes out
two Hungry Man dinners and sets them on the table.
T.J. (CONT'D)
-Hi Mitch. It's T.J. No, T.J. from
school. Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was
wondering if you still needed those
numbers we were talking about `cause I
got one.
-How much?
-Cool, but the thing is I don't really
have any wheels at the moment.
-On Moira road off 37.
-Yeah, but there's one more thing...(he
whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no
the air stunt challenge set.
-Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man. Thanks a lot.
Bye.
He hangs up and puts the dinners on the table.
61.
T.J. (CONT'D)
(to Ricky)
Ricky, time to eat.
T.J. turns around. Ricky has wrapped himself in Christmas
lights from head to toe, by slowly revolving while
holding the strings.
RICKY
Hey T.J., watch this!
He plugs in the lights and they turn on.
T.J.
Yeah, that's pretty cool. But it's gonna
hurt when you sit down.
Ricky giggles.
T.J. (CONT'D)
Now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time.
76
77
He hands Ray a wad of cash. She counts it, then nods to
Lila who pops the trunk.
78
NIGHT
79
Lila and Ray pull back onto Route 37 and drive along in
stunned silence.
RAY
It didn't feel like there was anything in
that bag.
LILA
We gotta go back.
RAY
I can't believe they put their baby in a
duffle bag.
LILA
I can't believe you left it out there.
RAY
If you'd let me search it I would never
have taken it-
LILA
We gotta go back.
RAY
I know! I know that.
63.
Ray speeds along.
80
80
Partly hidden, behind a barn, Trooper Mike Napoli watches
the cars pass on Route 37, leaving the Reservation. The
Acclaim passes.
81
81
The trailer is aglow in Christmas lights. Ricky has
fallen asleep on the couch.
A car horn blows outside. T.J. runs outside.
82
- NIGHT
83
T.J. comes back in. Smoke filters up though the cracks in
the linoleum floor. He covers Ricky with extra blankets
and opens the windows.
64.
84
85
Ray and Lila creep along.
LILA
Look, there. Tracks.
RAY
(squints)
Where?
LILA
Up there.
Ray speeds up. Faint tire tracks appear in the distance.
LILA (CONT'D)
Slow down, I don't want to run over it.
Stop. I think it was here.
Ray stops the car. Lila gets out. Ray puts her jacket
over her head and follows.
Ray's cell phone plays "Old MacDonald" on the seat of the
Acclaim.
86
86
Wearing his coat in the trailer, with the windows and
door open, T.J. dials the phone. He gets Ray's cell
phone.
RAY'S VOICE
(faintly heard though the
phone)
Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right
now, but if it's you, Troy, please at
least tell me you're alive, because the
boys are worried about you.
He doesn't leave a message.
Ricky snores on the couch covered in a pile of blankets.
65.
87
88
Ray gets in the car and sets the bundle down on the seat,
unwraps it from layers of swaddling and begins taking off
it's clothes. It is a boy.
She tries to resuscitate him, but there is no response.
LILA
It's dead.
Ray keeps giving it air. There is no response but she
keeps at it. Then, between breaths:
RAY
Tap the bottom of his feet.
LILA
Why?
RAY
That's what they did to get Ricky
breathing when he was born.
Ray puts the baby on Lila's lap. She pulls away.
LILA
I don't want to touch it.
RAY
Well, I can't hold it and drive.
66.
Ray cranks the heater and aims the vents at the baby.
Lila stares down at the baby in her lap, not touching it.
LILA
I don't think it matters.
RAY
At least put him next to your body. That
will warm him up.
LILA
But it's too late.
RAY
Just do it! We can't give it back to her
cold.
89
89
T.J. closes the windows and puts a package of microwave
popcorn in the microwave and turns it on. He watches it
begin to smoke, then pops open the microwave and takes
the smoking bag from room to room to hide the smell of
burnt insulation with burnt popcorn.
90
91
Ray notices the cruiser following her.
RAY
Shit!
Lila looks back.
LILA
Calm down.
Lila quickly pulls the baby near and wraps him inside her
coat hiding him from sight.
The DOME LIGHTS START FLASHING.
67.
RAY
Oh shit. What do I do?
LILA
Calm down. Just pull over.
RAY
What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's.
LILA
He's got no reason to stop us, unless you
give him one, so keep your mouth shut.
RAY
What if he searches the car. What do we
say about-
LILA
He won't, just remember you're white.
Ray pushes the blankets onto the floor and kicks them
under the seat.
92
93
In Ray's rear view mirror, Trooper Napoli gets out of the
cruiser. He puts on his hat and walks toward the car.
Ray rolls down her window.
TROOPER NAPOLI
License and registration?
Ray hands them over. He examines them, then leans down to
the window.
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
Could you step out of the vehicle, ma'am.
RAY
(fakely nice)
I wasn't speeding, was I?
TROOPER NAPOLI
Just step out of the car.
68.
RAY
Did I do something?
TROOPER NAPOLI
(suspicious)
Ma'am I'm just directing you to step out
of the vehicle?
RAY
Okay.
She gets out of the car reluctantly. He looks in at Lila,
she keeps her head down.
TROOPER NAPOLI
Step around to the back of the vehicle.
He follows Ray to the back of the Acclaim.
94
95
In her rear view, Ray watches him get in his vehicle, u-
turn and drive out of sight in the opposite direction.
LILA
(nervous)
What did he want?
RAY
Just a blown out tail light.
LILA
That's it?
RAY
Yeah.
96
96
T.J. looks at the clock. It's after midnight. He leads
Ricky, half asleep into his room and tucks him in bed.
Then he takes out the Hot Wheels Box and puts it under
the tree.
97
97
Ray and Lila pull in to the motel but there is no sign of
life.
Ray gathers up the blankets. Lila sits motionless.
RAY
We gotta take it in.
Lila sits absolutely still.
70.
RAY (CONT'D)
What is it?
LILA
It's moving.
RAY
What? Are you sure?
Lila slowly takes the baby from inside her jacket.
His
eyes open. He blinks. Ray and Lila stare at him.
LILA
Hello little baby.
The baby looks back at them.
RAY
He was just cold.
Ray and Lila wrap him up in the blankets and get out with
Lila carrying the bundle and walk into the motel office.
98
98
Ray and Lila look around the shabby motel office circa
1950s with a few threadbare chairs. No one is at the
front desk.
Ray ventures behind the desk and knocks on a small door.
She carefully opens it to a small office with a desk,
cluttered with papers and, beyond it, another door. Ray
knocks and opens it to:
A living room hung with heavy red Pakistani fabrics and
lights. The dealer and the Pakistani man study a map of
New York State spread out on the table.
Behind them the Pakistani woman sits on the couch.
Ray comes in, followed by Lila carrying the baby.
RAY
We found him.
The Pakistani woman looks up, sees the bundle and hurries
across the room to Lila. Lila holds out the baby with a
little smile and the Pakistani woman snatches it out of
her arms.
The Pakistani women pulls back the blanket and sees the
baby -- alive. She sinks to her knees letting out a
wail.
71.
Lila's eyes fill with tears. Ray chokes back her own.
RAY (CONT'D)
(to Lila)
Come on. Let's go.
Lila follows Ray out, looking over her shoulder at the
baby.
99
NIGHT
99
Lila and Ray drive away.
LILA
He was dead.
RAY
He was just cold.
LILA
He was dead.
RAY
Okay, whatever, you brought him back to
life.
LILA
That was the Great Spirit, not me.
RAY
All I know is Kmart is closed and I got
nothing for under the tree.
Lila looks at Ray.
RAY (CONT'D)
What?
Lila says nothing.
RAY (CONT'D)
Look, I don't have time for that. I can't
get deep about every little thing. I just
have to keep on going. I only need one
more run to have enough for my double.
100
NIGHT
100
Ray and Lila pull up in front of Lila's camper and stop.
Ray divides the money.
72.
RAY
Here.
Lila takes the money and starts to get out.
RAY (CONT'D)
Merry Christmas or whatever.
LILA
Yeah.
Lila gets out and goes inside.
101
102
Ray comes in. The box containing the Hot Wheels Tech
Track Air Stunt Challenge set is under the tree.
RAY
What's that?
T.J.
Hot Wheels.
She is suspicious.
RAY
Where'd you get it?
T.J.
I called a friend.
RAY
Mitch? Is that the friend you called?
It's probably stolen, you know.
T.J.
No, its not.
RAY
Well, I don't want you hanging around
him. That kid is bad news.
T.J.
It's not like you were gonna get it.
73.
RAY
Look , Mister, I got more important
things to worry about than toys. I'm
trying to get our doublewide.
T.J.
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
RAY
Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway,
Kmart was closed by the time I got off
work.
He gives her a sideways glance.
RAY (CONT'D)
What's that smell?
T.J.
Popcorn.
RAY
I told you to be careful with the
microwave, didn't I?
T.J.
Sorry.
103
103
A heavy THUD as something hits the side of Lila's camper.
LILA
Bernie!
She opens the door, but no one is there. At her feet she
sees a Pringles can. In it: the cash she left at her
mother-in-law's house for her son.
She looks towards the woods but there is no sign of
anyone. She shuts the door.
Inside she digs through an old box of junk and pulls out
a 2 foot long oval shaped wooden board, an infant board,
and a blanket. She wraps her pillow in the blanket around
the board in the Mohawk tradition and picks it up.
She tries it on her back, then leans it against the wall,
then hangs it on a hook on the wall.
74.
104
104
Christmas Morning. Ray stands at the stove in her
bathrobe making pancakes. T.J. helps Ricky set up his new
Hot Wheels Set.
A Knock at the door.
Another knock.
RICKY
Daddy?
Ricky runs to the door and opens it, then backs away.
Trooper Napoli is there.
TROOPER NAPOLI
Is there a Ray Eddy here?
Ray comes to the door.
RAY
Yes.
TROOPER NAPOLI
Can I speak to you outside for a minute.
RAY
I haven't gotten the light fixed-
TROOPER NAPOLI
It's not about that. I just have a few
questions.
RAY
Sure.
105
106
T.J. listens at the door. Ricky looks up.
RICKY
Why is the police man here?
T.J.
Shh.
From outside the door:
RAY (O.S.)
T.J. could you come out here for a
minute.
T.J. goes outside.
107
113
Ray and Lila look at it.
RAY
You should see the inside.
LILA
How many bedrooms?
RAY
Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the
master bathroom.
LILA
Wall to wall carpet?
RAY
Oh yeah. But the best thing is the
insulation. The pipes can never freeze.
Ray gets out.
RAY (CONT'D)
I'll be back.
She disappears into the Office.
Lila looks at the house.
114
114
Ray comes in on Guy Versailles giving a young couple the
hard sell.
VERSAILLES
...what I think you'll find with the
Commodore -- and you'll be the judge --
is that the vinyl wall covering is
perfect for small children. There is
never a need to repaint or even touch up-
RAY
I wanna schedule a delivery.
Versailles looks up, annoyed. He plasters on a smile.
83.
VERSAILLES
(to the couple)
Give me just a second.
He tries to take Ray aside.
VERSAILLES (CONT'D)
What do you want?
She pulls a huge wad of cash from her jacket pocket.
VERSAILLES (CONT'D)
Is this all of it?
RAY
It's three thousand but I want it
delivered tomorrow.
VERSAILLES
I told you all or nothing.
She holds out the cash. The couple tries not to watch.
RAY
Take it as a deposit. All you have to do
is show up. If I don't have the rest you
keep it.
VERSAILLES
Can't argue with that. You'll have to
sign something, though.
He takes out a contract and writes in the deposit amount
as thirteen hundred seventy two dollars owing.
Ray signs the paper.
CUT TO:
115
ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
115
Ray drives down the boat launch and starts across. The
sky is clear and the moon shines down on the white river
surface.
Downstream patches of the river have thawed and water
flows is visible.
There is only the sound of the wheels on the smooth ice
surface.
CUT TO:
84.
116
-
SAME
117
Ray and Lila drive down a Quebec highway. The road signs
are in French.
The skyline of Montreal is an orange glow in the far
distance.
RAY
Have you ever been there?
LILA
A few times. Have you?
RAY
No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked
to work in his shed, mostly.
85.
Ray and Lila drive down a commercial strip of shopping
centers, fast food joints and strip clubs, with French
names.
LILA
Up there. That's it.
RAY
Can't miss that.
118
119
They walk in. The place is mostly empty. There is a
scantily dressed BARTENDER and JACQUES BRUNO sitting at
the bar.
BARTENDER
Oui?
LILA
Bruno.
She points to Bruno. Lila and Ray approach him. He is on
his cell phone speaking in French.
He looks them over, then closes up his telephone.
BRUNO
(French accent)
You looking for a job.
LILA
No, Jimmy called-
BRUNO
Oh yeah, Jimmy. Okay.
He calls over the Bartender. She comes over. He points to
Ray and Lila.
She walks over to them.
BARTENDER
(softly)
Put your hands up.
86.
Ray and Lila put up their hands. The Bartender pat frisks
them for body wires. When she is finished:
BRUNO
Okay we go.
He picks up his full-length fur coat.
BRUNO (CONT'D)
D'is way.
They follow him out the back of the club. The Bartender
follows.
120
121
LILA
We gotta get off this road!
122
- NIGHT
123
Ray speeds down the road.
RAY
How much farther to the reservation?
LILA
Just up at the tree line.
Ray speeds towards it, but the Quebec cruiser still
pursues them.
RAY
What the hell? We're on the reservation.
LILA
They can't arrest us but if they catch us
they'll take the money.
RAY
Shit!
Ray bounces into the woods through the trees.
124
125
Behind them the flashing lights close in.
LILA
That ice is black out here.
RAY
Will it hold us?
LILA
I don't know.
Ray looks at her for a moment then drives toward the ice.
126
127
A BORDER GUARD picks up the phone. He nods, then hangs up
and makes a call to...
128
128
Trooper Napoli hears the call on the police radio.
DISPATCHER
...the Quebec Surete in pursuit of a
vehicle with New York State plates,
identified as a blue Plymouth Acclaim and
the suspects are two women, suspected to
be carrying illegals...
He recognizes the car and u-turns.
129
129
Ray and Lila hold their breath as they cross the river.
They make it over the midpoint and Ray accelerates toward
the shore.
Two hundred feet from the bank, the BACK RIGHT TIRE HITS
A CRACK in the ice. The TIRE DROPS and the UNDER BELLY of
the car SCRAPES THE ICE. SPARKS FLY.
The RIGHT REAR END of the car DROPS DOWN and the FRONT
LEFT TIRE LIFTS off the ice. The car TEETERS BACK AND
FORTH.
Ray and Lila sit perfectly still.
LILA
We gotta crawl out the window.
Lila rolls down her window. The car shifts. The wad of
cash SLIDES toward the edge of the dashboard. Ray grabs
it.
Lila pops the trunk. The two Chinese girls scramble out.
The four begin RUNNING FOR THE SHORE.
ANGLE FROM THE UNDER THE BRIDGE:
Trooper Napoli watches the action on the ice.
93.
130
133
A small house on the river's edge with a hand painted
sign:"Bakery" Jimmy drives up. He helps Ray, Lila and the
Chinese girls to the door.
The Ticket Taker, "VELMA" opens the door, wearing an
apron.
JIMMY
Hi Mom.
VELMA
Jimmy, I told you not to bring no more
half frozen people in here off the river.
JIMMY
(ignores her)
We just need to borrow your oven, Mom.
94.
He leads them, wet and freezing, to the bakery kitchen.
As they go by Velma and Ray recognize each other.
134
134
An industrial oven sits beside an old couch. Lila, Ray
and the teenage girls stand near it shivering.
Velma looks them over, frowning and shakes her head.
VELMA
I don't see how I can get any baking
done. I'm supposed to be baking 200
doughnuts for pee wee Lacrosse and now I
have people bleeding and dripping all
over my kitchen.
She opens a closet filled with Indian medicine plants and
takes out several kinds.
VELMA (CONT'D)
(to Ray)
Sit down, I can't reach up that high.
Ray sits down. Velma reaches up and dabs Ray's grazed and
bleeding forehead.
VELMA (CONT'D)
(to Ray)
Looks like somebody tried to blow your
brains out.
Ray winces in pain.
VELMA (CONT'D)
Get outta here, Jimmy. They gotta strip
down. (to girls) Gimme those jackets.
Velma motions to the Chinese girls to take off their
coats. They stare at her shivering.
She gently goes to one of the girls and helps her out of
her jean jacket. Under it she wears a short sleeved shirt
showing her bruised arms.
Velma sees the bruises.
VELMA (CONT'D)
Somebody's been beatin' up on you.
Lila and Ray see the girl's black and blue arms.
95.
Velma hangs the girl's jacket on the big oven to dry and
gives her an old blanket to keep warm.
Then Velma turns to Lila.
VELMA (CONT'D)
You, too.

MOHAWK CHIEF OF POLICE, BILLY THREE RIVERS, a stressed-
looking man in his 40's talks on the phone.
THREE RIVERS
-Good, good Mike. What can I do for you? -
-You say non-native smugglers?
-A white woman? On the Rez?
-I'll look into it and give you a call
back. Sure thing. (pause)
-I'll take your request to the Tribal
Council and give you a call back.
-No problem, Mike. You bet.

Billy Three Rivers sits down at a long conference table.
A middle-aged Mohawk woman, "BARBARA" sits behind a name
plate reading "CHIEF". At the end of the table Bernie
sits behind another name plate: "SUB-CHIEF."
Rosalie comes in wearing her coat over her bathrobe and
takes her place behind the "GRAND CHIEF" name plate.
THREE RIVERS
Hi, Rosalie.
ROSALIE
(puts on her glasses)
Billy.
THREE RIVERS
We have a situation with a couple
smugglers. They got chased by the Quebec
police and crossed the river but their
car went in and now the troopers know
they're on the Rez.
ROSALIE
Who is it?
96.
THREE RIVERS
Lila Littlewolf and some white woman.
ROSALIE
What do the troopers want?
THREE RIVERS
A surrender of the two illegals and the
Non-Native smuggler. They need an example
here.
ROSALIE
Do you know where they are?
THREE RIVERS
Probably over at Velma's.
ROSALIE
(to the other Chiefs)
What do you think?
BARBARA
Turn them in.
ROSALIE
What about Lila Littlewolf?
BERNIE
We got our own court system.
ROSALIE
We don't charge people with smuggling.
BARBARA
Maybe we should.
BERNIE
If we did, we'd have to arrest half the
people on the Rez.
Rosalie and Barbara shoot him an ANGRY STARE. He shrugs.
BARBARA
We can expel her.
BERNIE
You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the
Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six
thousand of us as it is.
ROSALIE
She makes the Mohawk people look bad.
97.
BERNIE
But she has a Mohawk son.
ROSALIE
She cost us a Mohawk son.
BERNIE
Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was
doin'
ROSALIE
She'll never be anything but a smuggler.
BERNIE
We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al
Capone.
ROSALIE
Then we'll take a vote.
137
138
The bell on the bakery door RINGS. Billy Three Rivers
walks in looking very official. Jimmy opens the door.
JIMMY
Hi, Billy.
He comes in and Velma walks in from the kitchen closing
the door behind her.
THREE RIVERS
Velma, seen any smugglers tonight?
Velma says nothing.
JIMMY
Come on, Billy, you never bothered with
smugglers before.
THREE RIVERS
Rosalie is worried people are gonna think
the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I
got the Troopers on my back. They want
the illegals and they say there's some
white lady with them too. Is that true,
Jimmy?
98.
Jimmy looks away.
THREE RIVERS (CONT'D)
You got white women doing it now? Jesus.
(after a moment) Well, if you see any,
let me know.
Three Rivers leaves.
139
139
Lila and Ray LISTEN from the kitchen. Ray eyes the back
door.
Ray grabs her jacket off the oven and takes half the cash
out of the pocket and hands it to Lila.
RAY
I gotta go.
Lila takes the money. The Chinese girls look on confused.
One gets up and grabs her jacket, but Ray motions her
back.
RAY (CONT'D)
No. You stay here.
Ray hurries to the back door, opens it, but Bernie
Littlewolf is there. At the sight of him, Ray backs up.
He walks in.
BERNIE
Hi, Lila.
LILA
Hi Bernie.
BERNIE
You're in a lot of trouble.
Lila looks at him, unfazed.
BERNIE (CONT'D)
The council voted to expel you.
LILA
Expel me?
BERNIE
For five years. You can appeal, but
you'll never be able to change Rosalie's
mind.
99.
LILA
They can't do that.
BERNIE
They'll make your life miserable if you
try to stay.
LILA
They've already done that.
BERNIE
Believe me, it could get even worse.
RAY
I thought this was all legal on the
reservation.
Bernie ignores her.
RAY (CONT'D)
(to Lila)
Look, I gotta get home.
She moves for the door, but Bernie blocks her.
BERNIE
If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila.
The troopers want somebody.
RAY
But, she's a Mohawk.
BERNIE
The Chiefs want her out, so there's
nothing standing between her and the
troopers.
RAY
Listen, my kids got no one but me.
BERNIE
If you leave she won't see her son again.
Ray and Bernie stare at each other.
LILA
Let her go.
BERNIE
Lila, you're giving up on him and he's
only one year old.
100.
LILA
(to Ray)
Just go.
Ray goes to the door, but turns around...
RAY
At least you got family to take care of
him, ya' know?
140
141
Lila and Bernie sit on the old sofa by the big oven.
LILA
He might be better off.
BERNIE
Jake wouldn't agree with that.
LILA
It was all for a new crib. I wanted the
baby to have a pretty new crib, not some
handmedown. And he wouldn't let me go
alone. (laughs) I was too fat to get
behind the steering wheel.
BERNIE
He wanted to keep you and little Jake
safe.
The back door opens. Ray is there.
RAY
It's just a few months, right?
Bernie and Lila turn around. Ray walks in.
RAY (CONT'D)
I got baby stuff in the shed.
101.
She takes the folded double-wide contract out of her
pocket and holds it out to Lila.
RAY (CONT'D)
Get a good used single wide with
insulation. Insulation is the key thing.
Versailles will give you a hard time, but
that will leave enough for you and the
boys to live on for a couple of months.
Ricky's allergic to penicillin.(a moment)
And you can't feed `em Pringles all the
time. Okay?
Lila isn't sure.
RAY (CONT'D)
Okay?
Lila nods her head.
RAY (CONT'D)
But you gotta get there quick, before the
police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I
don't want him to get scared, you know.
Ray chokes back her own tears.
LILA
Okay.
Lila takes the contract from Ray.
RAY
And don't let him jerk you around.
Versailles, I mean. (to Bernie) Go with
her. Okay?
Bernie nods.
BERNIE
Sure.
142
142
T.J. and Ricky eat supper to the glow of the TV in the
background.
RICKY
Can I have more corn?
T.J. dumps his own corn onto Ricky's plate.
102.
143
144
Bernie waits in the car. Lila walks to the front door.
Thunder looks up from beside the front step.
LILA
(shows her empty hands)
Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you.
She knocks.
Evelyn opens the door. Seeing Lila she tries to close it,
but Lila WEDGES herself inside.
145
145
Evelyn tires to push her out, but Lila walks in the
house.
EVELYN
What do you want?
Lila walks up to the Little Jake sitting in his high
chair, his face covered in carrots.
She reaches out to touch him, but Evelyn pushes her hand
away.
LILA
I need his coat.
Lila picks up the baby, and looks around.
LILA (CONT'D)
Where's his coat?
EVELYN
You can't have him.
103.
She grabs Lila's arm, but Lila shakes her arm free and
wraps Little Jake in her own jacket.
LILA
Say goodbye to your Dudah.
Evelyn stands in front of the door, blocking Lila. Lila
stops and they stand for a moment looking at each other.
There is anger and sadness. Evelyn moves aside.
Lila walks out with the baby.
146
146
Bernie stands by the car holding a CAR SEAT.
BERNIE
She's gonna kill me for taking this out
of her car.
CUT TO:
147
147
Ray sits in the backseat. The two Chinese girls beside
her.
RAY
How long is it for me. You know if I
confess?
TROOPER NAPOLI
As long as they're not on a watch list.
Four months.
He glances around at them.
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
I don't think you have much to worry
about judging from the look of them,
probably brought here to work in the sex
trade.
Ray looks at the two girls.
RAY
Will they get sent back?
TROOPER NAPOLI
Not necessarily. They can apply for
asylum.
104.
RAY
Can I have a cigarette?
He lights one for her. She takes it, shaking.
TROOPER NAPOLI
Is there somebody I can call for you? To
take care of your children.
RAY
I got somebody.
He looks back at her.
TROOPER NAPOLI
A relative.
RAY
A friend.
Trooper Napoli looks at her.
RAY (CONT'D)
But I need to call my kid.

INT RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT
148
The phone rings. T.J. picks it up.
T.J. (O.S.)
Hello. Hi, Mom.
She hears his voice and can't speak.
T.J. (CONT'D)
-Mom are you there? What's wrong?
-What kinda trouble?
-What did you do?
-A smuggler!? Holy shit!
-Are you in jail?
-But are you're going to jail!?
There is a long silence. He wipes a tear away with his
sleeve.
Ricky plays with his Hot Wheels on the floor.
T.J. (CONT'D)
-Yeah, okay. What does that mean? But
why? I can take care of him, I do it all
the time. But I don't see why we need-?
(MORE)
105.
T.J. (CONT'D)
-Who? (pause) A baby? No way.
-Yeah I know where the stuff is. It's in
the shed, but that's so stupid!.
A KNOCK at the door. T.J. looks at it, unsure what to do.
T.J. (CONT'D)
(holding phone)
-Yeah, I'm here. Somebody's at the door.
He walks to it and opens it holding the phone. Lila is
standing there holding Little Jake, wrapped in her jean
jacket.
T.J. and Lila look at each other.
She walks in.
T.J. (CONT'D)
-Okay. Bye.
He hangs up.
Little Jake sees Ricky playing with the Hot Wheels Set
and reaches to get down.
Lila puts him on the floor. He crawls toward the
Christmas tree and the Hot Wheels set.
T.J. (CONT'D)
(to Ricky )
You're gonna have to get the little
pieces up high -- or he'll eat them.

Ray rides in the back of the Cruiser. They pass by
trailer homes decorated for Christmas.
150
152
Ray is asleep in her new bedroom with wall-to-wall carpet
and a big window.
Her cell phone RINGS. She doesn't move.
RAY (O.S.)
(her voice message plays)
Hi, (happy) You've reached Ray. Leave me
a message and I'll get back to you just
as soon as I can.
The tone is heard.
TROY (O.S.)
(sad sack voice)
Ray, are you gonna pick up or not?
(MORE)
107.
TROY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
(pause) I need you to send me some money
so I can get home. I'm stuck here. I
could already be back at work by
now.(pause) Please Ray, I'm at the YMCA
in Tampa. I love you. I miss you. Please
call me here. Seriously. And tell the
boys-
The message cuts off with a "BEEP."
ClOSE ON: the cell phone screen. "12 NEW MESSAGES"
changes to "13 NEW MESSAGES."
153
153
A sign reads "Bridge to Canada."
A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St.
Lawrence River.
Cars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs
officials man booths at the center of the bridge,
inspecting and questioning impatient drivers.
Beyond them, a smaller sign: "THANK YOU FOR VISITING
MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for
you".
