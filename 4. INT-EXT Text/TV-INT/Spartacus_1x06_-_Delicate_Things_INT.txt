  The chant of "Spartacus" wafts through the infirmary.  
  CRIXUS lies on a slab, bloody and barely conscious from the 
  pain of his wounds received at the monstrous hands of 
  Theokoles. The MEDICUS nods to two GUARDS.  They pin Crixus 
  down to the slab as the Medicus pulls

  from the fire. The Medicus brings it to bear on the gory 
  wound snaking across Crixus  stomach. The flesh SIZZLES on 
  contact. Crixus SCREAMS, his agony lost in the cacophony of 
    celebration.



  Batiatus moves through the villa with Spartacus.  Lucretia 
  is close at hand.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This is only the beginning! I will 
                        build an empire of blood and glory 
                        upon your name!

                      He did not stand against Theokoles 
                        alone.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus is not forgotten. He will 
                        always have position, if he 
                        recovers.

  That last part hits Lucretia hard.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yet Spartacus is the name on the 
                        crowd s tongue. And I would see it 
                        spoken with ever increasing 
                        amazement.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                        Theokoles fought with.  We'll see 
                        the crowd's pleasure double with 
                        their hero now twice as deadly!  
                        And ceremonial armor, worthy of a 
                        legend!  Men will be made to feel 
                        smaller by it!  Women will moisten 
                      at the very sight.

  Batiatus catches the uncomfortable look on Spartacus  face.

  Batiatus produces a message scroll from his robes.

                        They bless him with news to lift 
                        heart higher than the clouds.

  Spartacus stiffens with impossible hope.

                        Soon the coin will be in hand. 
                        Enough to buy our freedom.

                        Freedom. The word is foreign to the

                      It will learn to savor the taste.

  He takes Pietros in his arms and kisses him.

                                          PIETROS
                        What of the birds?

                        They will fly this place as we do.

  Pietros breaks into a grin.

                        I will see what clothes we have 
                        washed and ready.

  He begins gathering stray garments strewn about the cell.

                                          PIETROS(cont'd)
                        Which direction shall we journey? 
                        How far will we travel?

                      As far as desire wills our feet.

  Pietros pauses, his eyes falling on a smear of BLOOD across 
  one of Barca s tunics.

  Barca frowns. Not something he wishes revisited.

                        There was nothing good about him.

  Barca hesitates.

                        Such were my orders. But you know 
                      of my affection for delicate 
                        things. The boy was spared, and set 
                      to wander far from the deed. By the 
                        time he is discovered, we will be 
                        free.

                        Clean forever more. And yours to 
                        command...

  He gently touches Pietros  hand. Pietros embraces him, 
  filled with relief and love. ADJUST to find ASHUR lurking in 
  the shadows of the corridor outside the cell. He s overheard 
  the entire conversation. OFF the moment...



  Lucretia soaks in a full bath. Naevia and another SLAVE GIRL 
  is in with her, gently stroking her skin with cloth (no 
  soap). Batiatus strips to join her.

                        our reach!

  As Batiatus slides into the bath, Lucretia spots his WOUND 
  from the failed assassination in 104, still red and angry.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      As are those that would have you 
                        dead.

  Slave Girl moves to Batiatus, stroking his skin with her 
  cloth.

                        grievance. But such things are not 
                      be hurried. I wish to savor every 
                        drop of sweat spilled from his brow 
                      as my noose tightens upon his neck.

                        Everything to its season.

  Batiatus takes the Slave Girl's hand and moves it down OUT 
  OF FRAME.  She continues "stroking".  Batiatus smiles at 
  Lucretia.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)

                        would watch.

  Batiatus grins.

  He turns the Slave Girl over and enters her roughly. She 
  gasps in pain, biting her lip. Lucretia sips from a cup of 
  wine, taking in the show.

                        The Thracian's wife concerns me.  
                        The promise of finding her was the 
                        only thing that has kept him in 
                        check.  What if her presence 
                        reverts him to his Thracian ways, 
                        and thoughts of defiance?

                      It will not.

                        Gratitude falls short of loyalty.  
                      He is not the man that Crixus is.

                                        BATIATUS

                        and may never be again. Spartacus 
                        will be reunited with his wife. And 
                      in the act... I will bind him to me

  OFF Batiatus, thrusting with increasing intensity, his eyes 
  gleaming with dark intent...



  CLOSE ON CRIXUS, asleep yet in obvious pain. A HAND reaches 
  down to stroke his face. ADJUST to find Lucretia standing 
  over him. Naevia and two GUARDS in the background.

  He indicates a table near Crixus where candles burn next to 
  a clutch of small, multicolored jars.

                        from your fucking body should he

  Lucretia sweeps out. Naevia steals a worried glance at 
  Crixus before following, WIPING US TO --



  WOODEN SWORDS COLLIDE. Pull back to reveal Spartacus running 
  Numerius through a practice routine. Numerius misses a 
  parry, grunts in frustration as he loses his sword.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        I have no hand for this.

  Spartacus nods to Numerius  belt that carries his knife and 
  the adornments to his robe.

                        warrior needs only a sword to 
                        cleave his fate.

  Numerius takes his belt and adornments off, leaving him 
  dressed only in a tunic. Spartacus  eyes flick to the knife 
  as Numerius picks up the practice sword, swings it through 
  the air.

                                        NUMERIUS

                        Come. Let us negotiate the price of 
                        the meal.

  Batiatus starts to move off with Calavius, pauses as two 
  GUARDS enter with a MESSENGER.

                                          MESSENGER
                        Begging pardon, Dominus. I bring 
                        word of great import to Magistrate 
                        Calavius.

  The Messenger hands a SCROLL to Calavius, who cracks the 
  seal.

                                        BATIATUS
                      An important man, seldom out of 
                        reach of public matters!

  Calavius stiffens at what he reads.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        The matter strikes more personal. 
                        Ovidius  boy yet lives!

  Numerius breaks off with Spartacus, eyes full of excitement.

                                        NUMERIUS

  Lucretia shares a concerned look with Batiatus. They are 
  fucked.

  Numerius jumps to follow.

                      Do not forget your things.

  Spartacus bundles Numerius  adornments round his BELT, 
  handing them back to the boy.

                                        NUMERIUS

  Numerius hustles after his father. As Spartacus watches him 
  go, drop back behind him to reveal he s PALMED NUMERIUS  
  THRACIAN KNIFE. OFF the gleaming blade...



  Batiatus sweeps the contents of his desk to the floor in 
  blind rage. Lucretia glowers.

  Crixus lies feverish, unconscious but obviously suffering. 
  The noise from the celebration sounds from outside.

  A shadow falls across Crixus. Reveal Spartacus having just 
  entered with his cups of wine. He considers Crixus for a 
  moment, then his eyes fall to jars of herbs used to treat 
  him on the table nearby.

                                          MEDICUS
                        What are you doing?

  Spartacus turns to find the Medicus appearing from the 
  shadows. Spartacus instantly shifts into a celebratory grin.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I come to share drink with my

                        needs rest.  And keep that fucking 
                        wine from his lips.

  Medicus steps over a passed-out Guard with a cup in his hand 
  as he moves to the apothecary across the room. Spartacus 
  sets his cups down next to the herb jar. He frowns, not 
  knowing which one he seeks. He glances at the Medicus, 
  forming a plan. He turns to Crixus, loud with "mirth".

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Without you, brother, my blood 
                        would have fallen in the arena 
                        instead of rain! May the gods 
                        forever honor Crixus, the 
                        Undefeated Gaul!

  He leans in close, whispering.

                        And forgive the pain I cause.

  He suddenly presses down hard on Crixus  stomach wound. 
  Crixus screams. Still half out, he thrashes in agony. The 
  Medicus rushes over.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

  Spartacus hands him the blue jar. The Medicus takes it, 
  quickly dropping several pinches of powdered herb into a cup 
  of water.

                        No.  But it will calm him to sleep 
                      so I may seal the wound.

  The Medicus shoves the jar back into Spartacus  hands, 
  turning his attention back to Crixus as he forces him to 
  drink. Spartacus furtively scoops a bit of the powder out as 
  he returns the jar to its place, then dumps it into one of 
  his wine cups.

                                          SPARTACUS

                        conscience. If Barca exceeded my 
                        orders and laid hand to such an 
                        act...

                      He did not kill the boy.

                        Perhaps you only tell me what I 
                        wish to hear.

                        No. Barca told me so himself. He 
                        swore he could never harm a child.

  Batiatus gauges that, smiles warmly.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                      to rest.

                        Hold it from him yet a while. I do 
                        not wish to taint the celebration 
                        with such dark thoughts.

                        Yes, Dominus.

  Batiatus waves the Guards over to return Pietros to the 
  ludus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Pietros?

  Pietros pauses.

                        Thank you for your honesty.

  Pietros breaks into a proud grin, nods as he moves off. 
  Batiatus darkens. Ashur appears from the shadows.

                                        ASHUR
                        The true nature of the man 
                        revealed. I would not have thought 
                      it of him.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let Barca hoist his cup. When his 
                        wits are damp with wine, I will see 
                        him rewarded for his loyalty.

  OFF the ominous proclamation...



  Spartacus, both cups of wine in hand, steps over several 
  Gladiators entwined with whores on the ground. The sound of 
  the partying grows quieter as he moves deeper into the 
  ludus, coming to the gateway of --                                                                                    33.



  Doctore kneels in front of a small ALTAR with RELIGIOUS 
  RELICS on them. He s deep in prayer. The sounds from the 
  party are faint. Spartacus stands in the doorway, regret 
  filling his eyes for what he s about to do. Doctore pauses, 
  sensing Spartacus.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You smell of wine.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I bring cups, full of celebration.

  Doctore stands, takes the dosed cup with a smile. Spartacus 
  forces one in response.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I honor your victory. With prayer.

  He sets the cup down near his shrine. Spartacus eyes it 
  tensely.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Your instruction made possible 
                        reunion with my wife. I would raise 
                        cups in gratitude.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The sentiment is well received. But 
                        wine has not passed my lips for 
                        many years.

                                          DOCTORE
                        No. It is a matter of discipline.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  laughs)(

                        Well beyond the station of her 
                        husband. If she had not come into 
                      my life...

                        truly blessed you.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She would say the same.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The gods and I do not tread common 
                        ground. Although she made effort 
                        many times to place us at even 
                        footing.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Wise and understanding. To love a 
                        man despite his shortcomings...

  Doctore smiles wryly.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She is the only reason my heart 
                        beats within my chest.

  A bit of sadness tinges Doctore s smile.

                                          DOCTORE
                      To find love such as this... A rare 
                        and fortunate thing.

  Spartacus picks up on that.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You speak from knowledge?

  Doctore s eyes fall on the shrine.

                                          DOCTORE
                        A wife of my own. The thought of 
                        her ever upon my mind.

                        Does she live?

                      In memory.

  Spartacus nods, the weight of that heavy in the air.

                        And tell her of her husband s 
                        worth.

  Spartacus picks up the cup of drugged wine.

  He takes the drugged cup from Spartacus  hand.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Discipline gives way to the moment.

  Doctore raises his cup. Spartacus follows suit.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You honor us.

  Doctore drinks. OFF Spartacus as he sips, eyes brimming with 
  emotion from betraying this noble man...



  The celebration is in full bacchanalian swing. Men drink and 
  play dice and bones. Rhaskos fucks a FAT WHORE from behind 
  as he throws. Varro, watching the game but not playing, 
  groans at the bad throw. Hamilcar laughs, scooping the dice 
  and offering them to Varro.

  VARRO

  eyes them hungrily, but shakes his head and moves off, 
  resisting the temptation. He passes a drunken Barca entwined 
  with

  He devours Barca's lips.   Barca responds, starts to undo 
  his own subligaria.  Neither one sees Ashur appear from the 
  shadows.  He frowns at the display, clears his throat.  
  Barca glances over.

                                        ASHUR
                        A word, if I may.

                        your desire for freedom, and makes 
                        noise of discussing terms. Your 
                        skills, while impressive in the 
                        arena, lack a certain gentle touch 
                      in the art of negotiation. I offer

  Batiatus turns to Barca, his face half in the shadows.

                        already been dissolved...

  Barca breaks into a grin, misunderstanding.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                        Impossible.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The Magistrate rides to retrieve 
                        him. Yet breathing, small fingers 
                        trembling to reveal the beast that 
                        took his family.

  Batiatus points at Barca. Barca s smile fades.

                                        BARCA
                        This cannot be. My hands upon his 
                        throat, I felt his life flee from 
                        his body.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your lover spoke otherwise.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You told him the boy lives. Did you 
                        not?

  Barca tenses.

                                        BARCA
                        I did. But only to calm him. If he 
                        knew the child s blood stained my 
                        hands...

                                        BATIATUS
                      So you lied to him?

  Ashur sees the conversation heading in the wrong direction, 
  moves to right it.

                                        ASHUR
                      Or he lies to you now.

  Barca glares.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Either way, there seems to be a 
                        serious issue of trust.

  Batiatus motions.  GUARDS, all armed with swords, appear 
  from the shadows.  Ashur slips a DAGGER from his belt.

                                        BARCA

  Batiatus turns his back as Ashur attacks, literally stabbing 
  Barca in the back. Barca grunts in pain. He whirls, slamming 
  Ashur back into a GLADIATOR BUST. The bust topples, smashing 
  to the floor.

  THE GUARDS ATTACK,

  Guard #1 slicing Barca across the arm.  Barca avoids a 
  second blow, kicks Guard #1 into the other men.  Using the 
    distraction, he makes a break for it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Stop him!



  Barca rushes into the atrium. Two more GUARDS sweep in, 
  cutting off escape. Barca avoids their swords, disarms one, 
  uses the weapon to slice them both open.

  LUCRETIA

  appears across the room, a stunned Naevia next to her. Barca 
  locks eyes with her, his face bloodied and panicked. He 
  doesn t see

  ANOTHER GUARD

  coming in behind him. The Guard swings his sword, SLICING 
  OPEN Barca s back. TIME SLOWS as blood sprays. Barca grunts 
  in pain, turning to engage the man. The other Guards from 
  the Trophy Room move in.

  BATIATUS AND ASHUR

  watch as the men hack at Barca. Blood sprays, but the giant 
  refuses to fall. INTERCUT the slow motion assault with --



  SLOW MOTION. Doctore SLUMPS to the ground. Out cold. The 
  empty cup falls from his limp hand.



  SLOW MOTION. Spartacus heads away from Doctore s cell. He 
  passes two GLADIATORS engaged in a THREESOME with a half 
  naked whore.                                                                                    40.



  SLOW MOTION. Spartacus passes Gladiators and Guards as they 
  drink, fuck, and gamble. Pietros drinks and laughs, waiting 
  for Barca to return with news of freedom.



  SLOW MOTION. Barca, BLOODIED AND EXHAUSTED, collapses to his 
  knees at the foot of the pool. His sword tumbles from his 
  hand.



  SLOW MOTION. Batiatus draws a KNIFE from his robes. He 
  slides in behind Barca and pulls his head back by the hair, 
  exposing his throat. BACK TO SPEED.  He leans in, whispering 
  in his ear.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are free.

  Batiatus slits Barca s throat in a spray of blood. Ashur 
  smiles as the giant falls face first into the pool. Blood 
  spreads around him in crimson swirls.



  TIGHT ON SURA S BINDING, gripped in Spartacus  hand. ADJUST 
  TO REVEAL Spartacus standing in the doorway of his cell, 
  looking out across the training square. The life he will 
  soon leave behind. He closes his cell door, PLUNGING US INTO 
  DARKNESS and ENDING THE SEQUENCE.



  Lucretia looms over a frightened Naevia. Batiatus washes the 
  blood from his hands in a bowl of water in the background. 
  Blood stains his tunic.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

                        wished him well and escorted him 
                        through the gates of the villa.  Do

  Lucretia grabs her wrist, twisting a bit. Naevia gasps in 
  pain.

  SOUNDS OF A COMMOTION from the Atrium.

                        Juno s cunt! What now?!

  Batiatus strides out, taking us to --



  Batiatus storms out with Lucretia in tow, freezes as he 
  spots Magistrate Calavius and his Guards pushing past 
  Batiatus  Guards.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Give fucking way!

                        Batiatus!

  Calavius strides over with his men, furious. Lucretia 
  tenses.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Magistrate. You call at unexpected

                        for dawn.

  Calavius pauses, his eyes falling on the blood staining 
  Batiatus  robe.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                        Nothing. A disobedient slave, 
                        freshly corrected.

                        returned from the promise of 
                        reunion with Ovidius  son, and 
                        would have words with a man seen in 
                        your house.

  Batiatus steels himself for what he knows is about to come.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Which man do you speak of?

                        Ovidius  child was never found upon

                      We shall exhaust every effort, 
                        until the villain is discovered.

  OFF the proclamation...                                                                                    43.



  Ashur slips a small purse of coins into the hands of 
  Marcellus, there to collect his whores. Passed out 
  Gladiators litter the ground. Weary whores disentangle.

                        will deduce the source of the 
                        message?

                                          MARCELLUS
                        Not unless Hades speaks of it from 
                        the underworld. The messenger has 
                        been put to grass.

                                        ASHUR

                        this transaction parts your lips 
                        again.

  Ashur moves off. OFF Marcellus as he glares after him, 
  spitting in contempt.



  Ashur hobbles along, stepping over drunken men. Gnaeus looks 
  up in a stupor.

  Ashur glowers, continues on past Barca s cell. Pietros comes

                        The price of freedom was too steep 
                        for the both of you. But do not 
                        worry. Barca will find another 
                        tight hole to sit on his cock. One 
                      he doesn t have to pay for.

  Tears well in Pietros  eyes. Ashur hobbles off, his grin 
  broadening as he WIPES US TO --



  Lucretia stands at the edge of the pool, looking down at the 
  now clear waters, lost in thought. Batiatus approaches.

                        woman? How is that cause for cheer? 
                        She will only remind him of his old

  on his face, deep in thought, TAKING US TO --



  Spartacus  eyes crash open. From outside, he hears the 
  SOUNDS of a cart moving into the square and the gate 
  closing. He quickly ties the purple binding around his arm 
  and picks up the THRACIAN KNIFE. He slips it into his 
  forearm guard, concealing it. He steels himself. Time to
