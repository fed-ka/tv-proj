  LUCY AND JAMES HAVE LUCY'S MOTHER, MARCIA, ON THE COUCH.

                                    LUCY

                So, Mom... We're engaged!

                                    MARCIA

                  (CLAPS HANDS TOGETHER, EMOTIONAL) 

                Oh my God!  (THEN, DEADLY SERIOUS) 

                  Please just don't wait to have kids. 

                No one is getting any younger here.

  LUCY AND JAMES REACT.

  FIONA ENTERS TO PICK UP THE DOG SHE SHARES WITH JAMES.

                                    FIONA

                  I'll be back with the pup on Friday.

                                    JAMES

                Uh, Fiona, we have some news.

  LUCY AND JAMES SHARE A NERVOUS LOOK.

                                    LUCY

                  (BLURTING)  We're engaged.

                                    FIONA

                  Really?  I gotta admit.  I thought

                  this was just a rebound thing.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  11.

  LUCY AND JAMES REACT.

    (James, Lucy)

  LUCY IS THE MIDDLE OF MOVING IN, DIGGING THROUGH BOXES
  AND PUTTING THINGS IN DRAWERS.  JAMES RETURNS FROM WORK
  IN A SUIT.  HE DROPS HIS BRIEFCASE.

                                    JAMES

                  (BOOMING VOICE, ENJOYING THIS) 

                  Honey, I'm home!

                                    LUCY

                You just love pretending you're in

                the 1950's.

                                    JAMES

                  That's nonsense.  Now, is the roast

                big enough?  My boss needs to come

                to dinner at the last minute.

  LUCY SMILES.

                                    LUCY

                Oh, I told people about the

                  engagement today.  Everybody at the

                  store was so happy for us.

                                    JAMES

                  That's nice.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  I gotta say I wish we had gotten a

                  little more of that from our families

                and friends.  I mean these are the

                  people we're closest to in the world --

                  we've been pretending to be happy

                for them for years!

                                    LUCY

                  I think it's just because we're

                  older and people are a little more

                set in their ways.  Give them time.

  JAMES NODS.

                                    JAMES

                  Hey, how did it go with the movers?

                                    LUCY

                  Good.  You know it's actually kinda

                  cool to see our stuff blended

                  together.  Makes it feel more real. 

                  I did move one thing.

  SHE LEADS HIM OVER TO A SPOT IN THE APARTMENT.  THERE'S
    A LARGE, DECORATIVE COLUMN.

                                    JAMES

                You moved my Yankee chair.

                                    LUCY

                  Yes.

                                    JAMES

                And replaced it with...?    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  14.

                                    LUCY

                  This decorative column.

                                    JAMES

                But it's not holding anything up.

                                    LUCY

                  Column, comma decorative.

                                    JAMES

                But you could sit in the Yankee

                  chair.

                                    LUCY

                  Don't get me wrong -- I love the

                  Yankee chair.  I just didn't think

                  this was a special enough place for

                it.

                                    JAMES

                So where did you put it?

                                    LUCY

                  I think the closet is a pretty

                  special place.  (OFF HIS LOOK)  How

                  about this?  We try it for two weeks

                and if you still don't like it, the

                  Yankee chair comes back?  

                                    JAMES

                  Fine.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  15.

                                    LUCY

                  It's just -- this was the first big

                  purchase I made to celebrate opening

                my store.  And it reminds me of how

                  scary that time was and how far

                  I've come as a person.  It's

                  something that makes a place feel

                  like home to me.

                                    JAMES

                  Well, if it means that much to you --

                                    LUCY

                  Thank you.

                                    JAMES

                No, if it means that much to you

                  then you're crazy and should get

                  help. 

  SHE GIVES HIM A PLAYFUL SWAT

                                    LUCY

                  Hey, I was thinking of getting

                  started on the wedding planning. 

                  Looking for a dress, a location, a

                  band.  That kind of thing.  Sound

                  good?

                                    JAMES

                  Sure.  Do you need any help?

                                    LUCY

                  Nah, I think I got it.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  16.

                                    JAMES

                  (GREATLY RELIEVED)  I have never

                  been more certain that you are the

                  woman for me.

                                    LUCY

                  This is where being a little older

                is really gonna pay off.  I have

                  been to one hundred and sixteen

                  weddings.  I know what I like.  I

                  even know the dress I want.  It's

                the one my friend Amanda wore.

                                                                          FLIP TO:    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  17.
