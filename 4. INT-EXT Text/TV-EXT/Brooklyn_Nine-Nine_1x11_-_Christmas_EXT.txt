                You gotta do it.  Santa breaks the law, 
                the law breaks Santa.

                              CHARLES
                No.  Even your cool cop talk can t 
                convince me to arrest Santa. 

                              JAKE

                  presents, I m keeping them.

  Jake moves towards Little Santa, who LUNGES at him.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Aaargh!  Get Santa off me!  God, you reek

  Big Santa gets involved, then Charles -- it s a mel e.  Jake 
  tries to pry Big Santa off Charles.

  Jake punches Big Santa.  Little Santa pulls out a knife and 
  faces Jake.

                Knife!  Santa has a knife!

  From behind, Charles KICKS Little Santa in the nuts.  He goes 
  down.

                That s right!  Boom!  I just kicked Santa

  Jake stands behind Holt s car.  Holt gets out.

                              JAKE
                Well well well.  We meet again.  Where 
                exactly do you think you re going?

                Your constant hovering is going to draw 
                  attention to the situation.  The last 
                thing I want is for the rest of the 
                precinct to get involved.  I m going home 
                to work in peace.

                Because I am a 21st century Sherlock 
                Holmes.  Boyle is my Watson, and Santiago 
                is my Moriarty.  I will defeat her.

                              HOLT
                I chose you because the threat is not 
                real, and I thought you d have no problem 
                breaking the rules and letting me do my 
                work.  Now, let me go.

                              JAKE
                Okay.  But your house is off-limits -- 
                  protocol.  If you really want to get out 
                of here, we can go to my mom s place.

                Or, I can lock in you the holding cell 
                with an armed escort.  Totally your call.

  Holt sighs, reluctant. 

                              HOLT
                Fine.  We will go to your mother s place.  
                I guess I am curious to see where...

                You ll love it.  She has a great internet 
                  connection.  Not bragging, just true.


  The squad enters the rail yards.

                              JAKE
                Okay.  Haimes is armed and dangerous, so 
                  remember: watch your six, keep the radio 
                open, and Santiago -- try to channel your 
                lust for me into your police work.  
                There s too much at stake. 

  They split up (Jake/Holt, Amy/Rosa/Charles, Scully/Hitchcock) 
  and FAN OUT.


  Holt and Jake walk with guns drawn.

                              JAKE
                If things go south, I want you to know: 
                it was an honor being able to order you 
                around.

                              HOLT
                Anything else?

                              JAKE
                Yes.  What cute little nickname do you 
                call your husband?

  Holt moves off.  Jake follows.


  Amy, Rosa, and Charles walk with guns drawn, looking kickass. 


  Jake and Holt continue to wander through the yard.

  Jake and Holt hustle by some train cars.

  Holt rolls his eyes.  Then we hear TWO GUNSHOTS.  Holt points 
  to the shots.

  Jake and Holt near the end of a row of cars.  From behind 
  them, Haimes jumps out of a boxcar with his gun drawn.

                about pointing a gun at you and pulling 
                the trigger, kind of like this --
