DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY
The Inferno is a run-down video arcade near the beach, notable because the
games it sports are generally defective and out of date.
Nevertheless,
it's become our group's hang-out.
It has its charms.
A huge mural, chipped and faded with age, adorns the front of the
arcade...something straight out of Hieronymus Bosch. Demons in day-glo.
The yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance.
ALEX AND THE OTHERS
pull up across the street, caravan style.
Greg and Alex are in one
car...an ancient Buick Skylark.
No Honda Accords or VW Rabbits for this
group.
At the moment, there's quite a bit of activity at the Inferno's entrance.
KIDS are clustered around and Slip-Stream employees are passing out Arcade
promo sheets.
THE GROUP
heads for the entrance, plowing their way through the crowd.
Stilts and
Benz have their skateboards, jumping up onto the curb with them, then
popping them up into their arms.
Outside, Greg is still nowhere to be found.
Benz, Stilts, and Laurie have
piled into their car, waiting for Nick to take the wheel.
NICK AND ALEX
are up by Greg's Skylark.
ALEX
So where is he?
NICK
Guess he took off...
You have his keys,
right?
Alex holds them up and gives them a shake.
NICK
Hmmm.
He said you were going to have
dinner?
ALEX
Yeah...
NICK
So take his car home.
Wait.
I'm sure he's
up to something...
ALEX
(cutting him off)
But he was playing the game.
I mean, you
saw him...
BEHIND THEM,
Laurie reaches over the seat and honks Nick's horn.
Laurie and the others
burst into LAUGHTER.
Stilts sets his skateboard on the street and rolls
it towards Nick.
BACK TO NICK AND ALEX
Nick stops the board with his foot and steps onto it, balancing.
He waves
to the others and turns back to Alex.
NICK
It's nothing, okay?
Just take his car home.
He'll show up.
Nick tousles Alex's hair.
He shakes his ARCADE cartridge at her.
NICK
Don't worry about it.
And with that, Nick's off, rolling back to his car and leaping over the
door, skateboard and all.
Laurie and the others are still screaming with
laughter.
Nick hits the ignition and guns the car, pulling out with a dramatic
SCREECH and sailing off down the street.
ON ALEX
clutching Greg's car keys.
She glances on the front seat, where her own
ARCADE cartridge rests.
THE CARTRIDGE
has the same glowing eyes that were laser-etched on the machine inside The
Inferno.
ALEX
Fuck-you.
CUT TO:
The Manning place is your basic suburban ranch house, totally
unexceptional.
The lawn looks a little ragged and a pile of newspapers,
frayed and yellowing, have accumulated by the front door.
Inside, the
house is dark. Lonely.
ALEX
pulls up in Greg's Skylark, scooping the ARCADE kit into her arms.
CUT TO:
Alex SLAMS into the ground, splashing up water and smoke alike.
We are inside ARCADE now, experiencing what Alex experiences.
THE PLAINS --
In many respects it looks like Earth.
Land, water, sky... Yet certain
things are off.
Small things, like the color of light, a sluggish
smoke-filled RED, or the occasional FLICKER OF LIGHTNING which races
beneath the cloud cover above.
ALEX
pulls herself up from the muck, brushing dirt and water from her face.
She coughs, totally disoriented.
Looks around.
Looks at herself.
She's wearing...
BATTLE GEAR
This is the real thing, as opposed to the cartoon version we saw Nick
wearing when he played the game before.
It's a cross between a
skateboarder's protective guardpads and full-blown armor.
A helmet rests
on her head, with a visor raised up.
Alex glances down and sees a thrasher board resting next to her.
(Note:
Depending on the terrain of each level, the thrasher board will adjust
itself...working as a skateboard, snowboard, or hover board).
ON ALEX'S RIGHT CYBERGLOVE
is an LED display.
In the upper left-hand corner it says "LEVEL ONE".
To
the right, two pulsing bars of light labeled "TIME ELAPSED" and
"STRENGTH".
At this very moment, the "TIME ELAPSED" bar is just shrinking away to
nothing.
BLINK!
Now it's gone.
No rest for the weary.
A SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM
is immediately heard on the horizon, and it's the most god-awful noise
we've ever heard.
It fills up the world.
ALEX
jerks her head up, terrified.
ALEX
(to herself, remembering)
Screamer.
All around her, the world begins to vibrate...
SOMETHING
is rushing towards her now at an unbelievable speed.
The SHRIEK/SONIC
BOOM is deafening.
The world is shaking apart.
And suddenly the thing is upon her!
Alex SCREAMS.
CUT TO:
MANNING HOUSE - NIGHT
Alex races to the Skylark and fumbles with the keys. Finally she gets it
right, guns the gas, and rips out of the driveway.
A STREETLIGHT
above is FLICKERING wildly.
Sputtering, HUMMING, casting strange shadows
across the street.
CUT TO:
NICK DRAKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Alex has climbed up to the roof, using a wood pile stacked beside the
house as a boost.
Now she creeps towards a second-story window.
Behind her on the street (and this should be subtle, folks), another
STREETLIGHT is flickering.
WINDOW
It looks in on Nick's room.
Alex draws close and TAPS on the glass.
Nick appears immediately, grinning like an idiot.
He raises the window.
NICK
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited
for this.
ALEX
Funny.
Alex climbs in.
BENZ' HOUSE -- DAY
Nick sits in the passenger seat of Greg's car, glancing across the street
at...
ALEX
She's standing on the front porch of Benz' house, talking with his MOM.
Mom is currently shaking her head.
Alex turns away and heads back towards
Nick.
She comes around the Skylark and pulls open her door.
NICK
Well?
ALEX
She thought Benz was at school.
Alex remains calm.
She sits for a moment, staring ahead. Finally she puts
the key in the ignition.
NICK
Where to now?
ALEX
Laurie's.
CUT TO:
LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DAY
Alex pulls the Skylark into Laurie's driveway.
The house is run down.
You wouldn't want to live here.
Above, the sky has clouded over.
It
looks like it's going to get nasty.
ALEX
Come on.
Nick follows Alex to the front door and Alex hits the buzzer.
ALEX
(to herself)
Laurie...answer...come on...
Alex tries the buzzer again.
Persistently.
ALEX
Shit.
Alex looks close to cracking.
There's a desperation in her face.
ALEX
This is like a movie or something.
I mean,
am I paranoid or what?
NICK
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
ALEX
(cutting him off)
Let's go around back.
Before Nick can stop her, Alex is running around to the back.
LAURIE'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- DAY
The backyard is in a sorry state, with junk strewn everywhere.
There's a
cannibalized car, piles of scrap wood, and a swing-set that's hopelessly
rusted.
Alex winds her way to the back porch and a set of dusty glass doors.
She
steps up and clears a spot to look through.
ALEX
(visibly relieved)
She's here!
Nick joins her at the window, peering inside.
THEIR P.O.V.
They are looking into a cluttered living room, dark except for the light
that's issuing from the television.
The television faces away from us,
but we can see Laurie, siting in front of it, mesmerized.
LAURIE
She looks like shit.
Wan, with sunken eyes and mussed up hair.
Mascara
has run down her cheeks, and even now, tears are trickling from her eyes.
Yet despite this, there's a dazed smile on her face.
We can't hear her,
but she seems to be talking to the television.
ALEX
steps back a moment, concerned.
ALEX
It is the game.
She taps on the window.
ALEX
Laurie!
INSIDE,
Laurie continues to watch the screen, oblivious to the rest of the world.
Alex TAPS the harder, using her fist now.
ALEX
(louder)
LAURIE!
Nick joins Alex now, and the two of them are banging on the glass.
There's no way in hell Laurie wouldn't be able to hear them.
Alex steps back from the window again, panicking.
ALEX
Nick, what do we do?!
Alex looks around, sees a two-by-four, and snags it.
NICK
(realizing)
No, Alex!
Alex, wait a minute...
Alex swings the two-by-four like a club and SMASH!!!
Down comes the glass
in a shower.
NICK'S HOUSE -- DAY
As Alex and Nick pull up, the streetlights BUZZ on and off even though
it's still daylight.
This doesn't escape Nick's notice.
Alex parks the car and the two of them jump out.
NICK
Around back.
Nick leads Alex to a cellar door and down inside.
NICK'S HOUSE -- DAY
Alex sits on the hood of the Skylark watching the streetlight above with a
wary eye.
She glances at her watch.
About a minute and a half has
elapsed and...
Here's Nick now, carrying a lap-top computer and a modem hook-up.
Nick
sets the equipment in the back seat.
NICK
We need to find a pay-phone.
CUT TO:
SHOPPING MALL, PAY-PHONE -- DAY
Nick sets up his lab-top inside the phone booth as Alex watches.
He hooks
up the modem to the phone receiver and turns the machine on.
THE SMALL SCREEN
warms up, and in black and white, we see the same FRACTALS. Nick flips off
the lap-top and sighs.
NICK
That's what I thought.
ALEX
What?
NICK
It's not just the cable system.
It's in
the phone system as well, the electronic
net.
It's everywhere.
ALEX
Nick, what is it.
NICK
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of
electronic intelligence.
It's like a
computer virus that developed a personality
or something.
It's self-replicating...it
mimics life.
ALEX
Like the fractals?
Nick nods.
He grabs his skateboard out of the back seat and sits on the
curb, spinning a wheel with his finger.
He stares at the wheel a moment.
NICK
It's growing.
Getting stronger. Maybe it's
only localized now...
ALEX
(catching his drift)
...but then it hits the relay stations...
NICK
Right.
And then communication satellites,
and then anywhere.
Alex looks up into the sky despite herself.
ALEX
(disbelief)
Anywhere.
(beat)
We have to stop it from getting out.
NICK
(shakes his head)
It's already out.
ALEX
The Police, then...
NICK
Give me a break, Alex.
What are we going
to tell them?
Excuse me, officer, but
there's some sort of electronic monster
loose in the phone lines.
I'd think twice
about calling any of those 976 numbers...
ALEX
(angry)
Then where do we go?!
NICK
I don't know.
Alex stalks off a few paces.
Thinking.
Thinking...
ALEX
SLIP-STREAM.
NICK
What?
ALEX
They made ARCADE.
It's still a game,
right?
It thinks like a game.
Maybe it
still has to play by the rules. Someone had
to program it in the first place, didn't
they?.
At this, Nick perks up.
NICK
You mean we learn the rules...
ALEX
And beat it at it's own game.
NICK
You realize that in order to do that, we'd
actually have to play the game.
ALEX
I was afraid you'd say that.
CUT TO:
SLIP-STREAM, INC. -- DAY
The SLIP-STREAM compound comprises a cluster of mirrored,
antiseptic-looking buildings.
Carefully maintained greens surround the
compound, dotted with perfectly positioned trees.
The whole effect,
greenery included, seems prefabricated and sterile.
We move with the
camera, sweeping in and dropping low, across the main concourse and up the
stone steps to the main lobby...
Nick ROCKETS off the loading dock, through the air and down, hitting the
concrete driveway.
The driveway peels off to the left and slopes
downward.
Nick hangs tight, hugs the curve, and picks up more speed.
BELOW,
the driveway splits off.
To the left, SLIP-STREAM's main building, and to
the right, the parking lot.
GUARDS
are piled into an electric cart, SPEEDING up from the left to cut Nick
off.
It's going to be close...
Nick forks off to the right dust before they reach him.
It's clear sailing now, and up ahead, Nick can see Alex pulling up to the
end of the driveway...
WHOOSH!
Nick scrapes the board forward, grinding the wheels sideways in
order to slow his speed...
He leaps. picking the board up with him. and dunks himself smack-dab in
the back seat of the Skylark.
ALEX
guns the engine and tears away in a cloud of exhaust.
Nick is in the back seat, LAUGHING.
The sun is beginning its descent and
the sky is taking on a reddish tint.
NICK
Jesus Christ!
ALEX
I can't believe you made it!
Nick climbs into the front seat next to Alex, and for a second, he's
pretty close to her.
He kisses her on the cheek...caught up in the
moment.
Then he sinks back, catching his breath.
ALEX
You got the schematics?
NICK
Everything.
Neither one speaks for a moment as the mood dampens once again.
Driving.
Wind whipping Alex's hair around.
She stares at the road ahead.
ALEX
So where do we play the game, Nick?
Nick doesn't answer at first.
For a second there, he'd managed to forget
everything.
NICK
I've been thinking about that.
(beat)
ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the
place to hit him would be where the virus
started.
You know, like his point of origin?
ALEX
(grim)
Dante's Inferno.
NICK
Yeah.
(deep breath)
The Inferno.
OVERHEAD,
as we watch Alex's Skylark speed away from us.
Shadows are creeping
across the landscape now.
Streetlights are flickering, sputtering on.
And night is falling.
DISSOLVE TO:
Sweeping down from the sky, we follow The Skylark.
As Alex and Nick near
The Inferno, streetlights blink off in succession... progressive darkness
working its way towards their destination.
DANTE'S INFERNO
We move past the painted walls, the various demons illuminated by
moonlight.
Alex and Nick rush to the front door.
It's gated.
Inside, The Inferno is
totally dark.
Shadows.
ALEX
The windows are barred...
(thinking)
There's a skylight.
We can get in through
the roof.
CUT TO:
DANTE'S INFERNO ROOF - NIGHT
Alex and Nick creep over the roof, and sure enough, there's a skylight in
the center, caked with grime.
Nick stands and plants his foot through the skylight.
It SHATTERS,
raining down glass into the darkness below.
Nick pulls off his belt and hooks it around one of the iron sash bars.
Gripping the belt, he lowers himself down. After a moment, he disappears
from view.
Alex leans over the skylight.
She can't see a thing.
ALEX
Nick...
(beat)
Nick!
For the longest moment there's no response.
Then...
NICK (O.S.)
(from below)
Okay, your turn.
Alex climbs over and grasps the belt tightly, lowering herself down into
The Inferno.
LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAY
Alex and Nick slam into the ground like twin meteors, splashing up water
and muck.
THE RED SKY
crackles with LIGHTNING.
Smoke obscures everything. Alex and Nick pull
themselves up, a bit dazed.
ALEX
(looking around)
You feel it?
It's different this time.
NICK
We're actually inside, aren't we?
Alex nods.
NICK
Okay.
(deep breath)
Give us a kiss?
ALEX
(after a moment)
One.
In case...
NICK
Don't even say it.
Nick leans over and gently kisses Alex on the lips.
It's over in a
moment, but he'll savor it the rest of his life.
NICK
Thanks.
Always wanted to do that.
ALEX
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual
circumstances.
NICK
(grins)
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Nick flips the visor on his helmet down and checks the digital read-out on
his CyberGlove.
When he speaks, his VOICE is filtered through a radio
headset.
Nick looks good in his armor, tough.
Hell, they both do.
NICK
I'll take the lead and handle the physical
threats.
You watch the elapsed time and
look for exits.
ALEX
Got it.
Nick tosses his thrasher board down and it hovers above the water.
He
steps onto it, comfortable.
Alex does the same. She's a little shaky, but
she maintains her balance.
NICK
You steer by pivoting your back foot...
(he demonstrates)
Okay?
Nick turns, looking around.
The land seems identical in every direction.
NICK
Which way do you think Level Two is?
ALEX
You've got the schematics, check.
Nick panics for a moment, patting his uniform, checking pockets.
He can't
find them.
NICK
Oh shit!
What if they didn't come with us?!
He stops.
Reaches into a pocket, and pulls out the schematics.
Breathes
a sigh of relief.
NICK
(looking at them)
Okay.
It's West.
ALEX
The keys are supposed to be at the end of
each level.
Once we get all the keys, we
can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
She looks at Nick, uncertain.
NICK
...and then we go to the Final Level.
(off her look)
Hey, don't worry about it.
It's a game.
How bad could it be?
Alex glances at her wrist display.
The "ELAPSED TIME" bar is made up of
ten blocks of light stacked upon each other. The top block has
disappeared.
One tenth of their time is gone.
ALEX
The clock's already ticking.
NICK
Right, then...
Nick leans forward and the board starts to float.
Alex does the same, and
in seconds, they're gliding over the plains.
FROM ABOVE,
as we see their forms disappear in the smoke.
DISSOLVE TO:
Nick and Alex pull to a stop.
A DOORWAY
stands in the plains, seemingly leading to nowhere.
Nick reaches out and
opens it.
It's just plains and empty space beyond...
...but hanging from the top of the doorway is a golden key.
ALEX
There...
She reaches up and pulls it down.
NICK
I don't get it.
This is supposed to be the
end of the level, but it doesn't go anywhere.
Alex puts her hand through the doorway and her hand disappears.
ALEX
It only looks like it leads to nowhere.
Nick glances at his wrist display.
NICK
And we've still got time left.
This was a
piece of cake.
ALEX
Yeah, that's what worries me.
She steps through the doorway and disappears.
Nick follows.
We hold on the empty doorway.
Hold for a moment, and then...
We hear a distant, high-pitched RINGING.
It's grating, seeping inside our
brains and mucking around in there.
On the horizon there is a quick FLASH
OF LIGHT.
Something is coming.
CUT TO:
The words "LEVEL TWO -- DEADLANDS"
LEVEL TWO, SALT FLATS -- DAY
Alex and Nick are cruising along salt flats.
Sporadic pools of water and
strange ROARING sounds in the mist.
So far so good. Nick glances at his
wrist display.
His "STRENGTH" only has a few blocks left.
NICK
Hey, my strength's low.
Look out for
Fireflies.
ALEX
There...
She points North.
A small BALL OF LIGHT is streaking across the sky, just
above the watery plains.
Alex and Nick swerve towards it, gaining ground.
As they near it, Nick
swings out his hand, scooping the Firefly up. As soon as he touches it, it
bursts like a bubble.
NICK
Shit...
ALEX
Check your read-out.
Nick does.
His "STRENGTH" is back to normal again.
NICK
You're right.
It worked.
Nick and Alex slow their boards to a stop, stepping off them.
ALEX
(pointing)
There's another...
She sweeps left and scoops the second Firefly out of the sky.
Off in the
distance we can hear that RINGING again, just at the edge of our vision.
Alex and Nick don't hear it yet.
Nick is glancing down at his schematic of Level Two.
NICK
According to this, the doorway should be
somewhere around here...
THEIR P.O.V.
The salt flats have gradually diminished, replaced by more and more water.
Ahead of them, there's no longer anything solid to stand on...just water,
muck, and strange reeds poking through the mist.
Alex's wrist display begins to BEEP.
She glances down.
WRIST DISPLAY
Only one block of time remains and it's pulsing on and off. The RINGING is
a little louder now.
ALEX
(worried)
Our time's up.
NICK
What?!
There's nothing here!
ALEX
Look around...
The two of them stumble through the water, not even sure of what they're
looking for.
NICK
(starting to panic)
I don't see the doorway!
Alex and Nick's wrist displays are BEEPING like crazy now. The beeps come
closer and closer until they meld into one piercing high-pitched TONE.
JUST THEN,
the RINGING turns into the SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer.
A burst of
light on the horizon shatters the sky.
NICK
What the fuck is that?!
ALEX
Screamer.
ALEX
plunges into the marsh-like water, waist-high, and it's then that she sees
a glow emanating from beneath the water. She dives forward...
BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE BRACKISH WATER
Alex swims towards the GLOW.
Ahead of her, the depths drop off sharply,
perhaps some hundred feet or so.
HER P.O.V.
She can just make out a doorway...down, down, down...
THE SURFACE
Alex bursts up from the water, gulping in breaths of air. Nick is nearby.
THE WORLD
is beginning is vibrate now, heralding the Screamer.
The SHRIEK is
unbearable.
ALEX
Nick!
It's beneath the water!
We have to
swim!
Nick stumbles in up to his neck.
He can see the GLOW now too.
NICK
(incredulous)
We can't reach that!
ALEX
(over the noise)
We don't have a choice!
Alex dives beneath the surface again.
Nick glances back towards the horizon and gets one fleeting glimpse of...
THE SCREAMER
A nightmare creation rocketing in from the East... That's it for Nick.
He
dives, terrified.
UNDERWATER,
Nick follows Alex into the shadowy depths.
He swims madly, but the GLOW
seems impossibly far away.
Even under water, the Apocalyptic sound of the
Screamer can be heard.
NICK
peddles his arms and legs furiously.
Down, down, down...
He knows that they'll never have enough air to make it back to the
surface.
THE GLOW
is more clearly distinguished now.
It's a DOORWAY.
And set in its side
is a golden key.
Alex reaches it.
She grabs the key and turns to see how
far behind Nick is...
NICK
doubles his efforts, but his lungs are straining...
THE SCREAMER
has plunged into the water above, shooting towards Nick like a torpedo, a
swirling jet-stream of bubbles trailing around it.
Nick panics, and what little air he has left escapes him.
Alex is reaching for Nick...
Nick is blacking out, one last lunge at the doorway...
The Screamer is there now.
No time.
The words "LEVEL THREE -- THE BLUE DESERT" flash across the screen and
we...
CUT TO:
LEVEL THREE, DESERT -- DAY
Alex and Nick fall from the sky onto the dunes.
They lie there a moment,
gasping for breath.
They're an odd sight, two people soaked from head to
toe, dropped in the middle of a bone-dry desert...
...and a blue one at that.
There's an eerie stillness about this Level,
even the clouds above are frozen. Nothing lives here now, and nothing ever
will.
Nick coughs, sucking in air.
Alex rises halfway, pulling up her visor.
She stares at the golden key
which she clutches in her hand.
Her wet hair hangs about her face in
strings and she shivers.
NICK
(looking at the key)
So that's what we almost died for?
ALEX
One of them, anyway...
(beat)
Did you see it?
The Screamer?
NICK
(looking away)
I don't want to talk about it.
Nick glances at his wrist display.
DISPLAY
Even as he watches, the first of the ten "TIME ELAPSED" blocks blinks
away.
NICK
(exhausted)
Christ...no time...
ALEX
(rising)
There never is.
Nick heaves himself up into a standing position and looks around.
They
are on the top of a massive dune.
THEIR THRASHER BOARDS
now looks like snowboards.
It doesn't take Nick long to figure out what
to do.
NICK
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope.
Pretend you're on a snowboard.
ALEX
(snapping down her visor)
Never been on a snowboard.
Nick steps on the board and edges it over the crest of the dune.
He
begins to slide down, slowly picking up speed.
A SERIES OF SHOTS...
...as Alex and Nick negotiate the dunes.
They glide over the sand
gracefully, cutting back left and right to keep their speed down, sweeping
in wide arcs...
Under any other circumstances, they'd be having the time of their lives.
Alex has adjusted to the environment quickly, at ease of the
Thrasherboard.
LATER --
The dunes gradually level out.
Alex and Nick slow to a stop.
Alex flips up her visor.
Her face is covered with grime now, hardened.
ALEX
I guess we're walking from here on out.
They pick up their boards and walk.
DISSOLVE TO:
LEVEL THREE, DESERT -- LATER
Alex and Nick have been walking for a long time.
Nick is silent, just
staring straight ahead at the endless sand. He looks wasted.
Zoned out.
His face is beaded with sweat.
Once again, their wrist displays begin to BEEP.
ALEX
(almost a whisper)
Time's up.
Nick starts to LAUGH, sinking to his knees.
NICK
We're fucked.
That's it.
Alex pulls on Nick's arm, forcing him to his feet.
ALEX
Get up, Nick...
Nick isn't going anywhere fast.
Alex tries to drag him forward, but she
slips in the sand.
ALEX
GET UP!!!
And then, from off in the distance...
VOICE (O.S.)
(far away)
Alex...help me...
Alex turns.
She focuses on the horizon and sees a tiny speck.
She taps a
control on her helmet and her view is magnified.
ALEX'S P.O.V.
Benz is up ahead. buried up to his waist in the blue sand and sinking
quickly.
He waves his hands for help. and clutched in one of them is the
second key.
ALEX
It's Benz!!!
Alex breaks into a run, and after a moment, Nick follows. He's walking,
though...in no hurry to reach Benz.
ON BENZ
The desert is swallowing him up.
Only his head and arms remain.
He's in
a state of total panic.
BENZ
(terrified)
Get me out of here!
Oh God!!!
ALEX
is running at top speed, half-stumbling across the dunes. Her
wrist-display is BEEPING furiously.
BENZ
His head starts to disappear beneath the sand and his cries are choked
off.
ALEX
Benz!
Alex reaches the spot and now, only Benz' clutched fist remains.
The hand
opens and the gold key falls onto the sand.
Alex DIVES for Benz' hand, but it sinks just before she can reach it.
She
SCREAMS and claws at the sand, trying to find him.
She digs and digs, but
all she finds is more sand.
With each second she becomes more frantic.
Finally Alex stops, noticing the key and idly picking it up.
THE SAND
around Alex ERUPTS and BONES come flying up into the air, Benz' bones!
Alex SCREAMS.
The bones rain down around her in bloody fragments.
It's
as if the Earth has chewed Benz up and spit out the nasty bits.
At that very moment, the BEEPS on her wrist-display meld into the single
tone heralding...
THE SCREAMER
As if on cue, it enters Level Two, breaking the Sound Barrier.
ON NICK
As he stands some hundred feet away, oblivious to everything.
We can hear
Alex SCREAMING, but the sound is muffled, distant.
Nick is staring down
at his feet at an area where the sand has hardened like glass.
Inside the
sand/glass, Nick can make out fractals.
He smiles.
THE SCREAMER
streaks across the sky towards them, blowing up a maelstrom of sand as it
crosses the dunes...
ON ALEX
as she sees that a rabbit hole of sorts has been created where the bones
were ejected.
Actually, not a rabbit hole, but a circular, pulsing mouth
with razor sharp teeth.
Alex realizes, much to her horror, that this is
the doorway to Level Three!
Alex shouts at Nick, trying to break the spell over him.
ALEX
Run!
RUN!!!
But the Screamer is bearing down on him, like a heat-seeking missile...
ON NICK
as he watches the fractals.
ARCADE'S face appears in the mirrored sand,
smiling back at him.
ARCADE
GOODBYE, NICK.
At the last possible moment, Nick seems to wake from his trance.
He sees
Alex, hears her, then turns.
He has about one fear-wrought second to
realize that the Screamer has reached him when...
WHAM!!!!!!!!!
The Screamer SLAMS into Nick at about 200 miles per hour. Nick, literally,
liquefies.
The human body is 95% water, and Nick EXPLODES like a water
balloon on high impact, blood spraying in a fine mist across the dunes,
Alex, and everything for a good fifty yards.
Alex is frozen with terror.
You remember your worst childhood nightmare
monster?
The one you'd see in your room at night as your brain cooked
with fever?
Too paralyzed to call out for Mom?
Well that's the Screamer.
THE SCREAMER
stands where Nick used to be (a red mess on the blue sand now).
Black as
night.
Like living, roiling lava. Smoking, charged RED EYES.
One third
demon, one third Balrog, and one third rotting corpse.
Clad in chains and
samurai armor, CLINKING as it moves.
It rear back its head, opens a
fanged mouth, and lets loose a ROAR designed to shake the stars from the
sky.
Then it focuses it's eyes on Alex.
And it charges.
ALEX
unfreezes.
She's got seconds to make up her mind, the doorway/mouth or
the Screamer.
It's really no choice at all.
Alex turns and dives
straight down into the pulsing mouth.
The jaws of the rabbit hole SNAP shut around her.
Darkness consumes
everything.
These words appear on screen, "LEVEL THREE -- TOWER OF GHOSTS"
CUT TO:
LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO -- DAY
We are looking at a steep cliff face composed of black, volcanic rock.
This world is desaturated, gray, and harsh. The rocks looks sharp as
razors.
As we will discover, the cliff face is also composed of skulls, old and
blackened, set inside the rock.
We hear a HUMMING and Alex "fades in", appearing on the side of the cliff
face.
Immediately she starts to fall, realizes where she is, and hugs the
cliff for dear life. Rock shards crumble away beneath her feet.
Alex
looks down ...
Big mistake.
She hugs the cliff face tighter, tears and grime streaking her face. She's
alone now and she knows it.
She looks up ...
It's a long way to go.
Alex reaches a hand upward.
Ouch!
The rock's hot.
She jerks her hand
back and almost loses her perch.
HER HAND
Her gloves are smoking and singed.
Alex starts to cry freely now.
She reaches inside her chestplate,
fumbling, and pulls something out...
It's the Polaroid of her and Greg.
But then the wind catches it and tears
it from her hand.
THE POLAROID
twists downward, round and round into infinity.
Alex stares after it a moment.
Then she lets out a tired little laugh and
starts to climb.
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES...
as Alex climbs, sometimes using a skull itself as a hand or foothold.
We see her "TIME ELAPSED" blocks blinking away.
Time running out and more climbing.
Then...
LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO RIM -- DAY
Alex stands on the rim of the volcano.
At her feet is a golden key.
And
before her, a big drop.
ALEX'S WRIST DISPLAY
Her final block of time disappears.
The BEEPING starts.
Alex doesn't even pause.
She steps off the rim into empty space...
...and just as she's about to fall, a doorway of light appears in the air.
Alex falls through it, vanishing.
"LEVEL FIVE -- KINGDOM OF THE BLIND"
CUT TO:
LEVEL FIVE, ARCTIC WASTES -- DAY
Snow whips across a world of white in wraith-like sheets. We move in on
one particular bank...
Something is buried there.
The wind gradually blows the snow away,
uncovering...
ALEX
She rises from the snow bank, disoriented.
Everything is impossibly
bright, blinding.
Alex stands.
She draws up her hand to shade her eyes
and we...
DISSOLVE TO:
BEGIN MONTAGE:
Music begins.
CELLOS.
Like before.
Alex, snowboarding for real this time, over slopes of powder...
Alex's "STRENGTH" diminishing...
Alex catching Fireflies...
Alex jumping across a crevice on her board.
(Warren Miller stuff
here)...
"TIME ELAPSED" growing with every moment...
Alex gliding down mountainsides...
A flash of Greg, of Benz, of Laurie...
A flash of Nick...
NICK'S VOICE (V.O.)
I know how to do this.
I'm good at these
games.
You never play, you'd get nailed in
a second.
And a flash of Nick's horrified face at the Screamer reaches
him...
Alex's face, grim and determined...
LEVEL FIVE, ARCTIC WASTES -- LATER
Alex glides to a stop even as her wrist display starts to BEEP.
This time
a wooden doorway is standing directly in front of her, the golden key
sticking out of the lock.
As Alex reaches for it, the Screamer enters Level Four. Alex slowly opens
the door.
ALBERT'S VOICE (V.O.)
You can get a free life on Level Four, but
you have to wait for the last possible
instant...
Alex turns and waits calmly for the Screamer.
THE SCREAMER
is a black speck on the horizon, then a bullet, then a nightmarish face
bearing down on her...
IT'S JAWS
flare open to engulf her.
Alex doesn't flinch at all.
And at the last possible second before
impact...
BLINK!
A stylized figure appears on her wrist-display next to the "TIME
ELAPSED" meter.
Beneath the figure it says "FREE LIFE".
Alex feels the breath of the Screamer on her face and falls back through
the doorway...
"LEVEL SIX -- SHOCK CORRIDOR"
CUT TO:
LEVEL SEVEN, PIER -- DAY
The sound of SHATTERING GLASS carried through as Alex EXPLODES out of the
sky.
And it's the sky itself that seems to be shattering...
Title reads "LEVEL SEVEN -- SEA OF DARKNESS"
ALEX
continues her fall.
She lands hard.
No blue desert sand to cushion her
here.
It takes her a moment to rise...
Alex is on a slat-board pier extending out into a sea of black water.
The
shore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier.
Storms
clouds have gathered above, and if you've seen a storm blowing in on the
open sea, you know what it looks like...
...the and of the world.
A strange and scary yellow/green sky presses
down on us.
It's a hurricane sky.
The calm before the storm.
ON THE HORIZON,
TWO CITIES can be seen.
Techno-cityscapes, angular and metallic-looking,
towers jutting up from the sea like knives.
AT THE END OF THE PIERS
are two boats.
Standing in them are two pale-faced, cloaked FIGURES.
Like Charon, the boatman on the river Styx.
Somewhere off in the distance, the RINGING can be distinctly heard now.
But Alex is preoccupied now.
As she moves down the pier, recognition
dawns on her.
It's Laurie and Stilts.
They are dressed completely in black, hair
slicked back and eyes empty.
White-faced Gothic harlequins.
Each is
holding a wooden staff, staring into space.
ALEX
Guys!
Oh my God...
Alex rushes forward, excited, but as she sees their faces excitement
fades.
A chill wind picks up and the sea laps at the pier like a
metronome, lulling the world into stillness.
ALEX
(unsure)
Laurie?
Stilts?
Neither of them acknowledges Alex with their eyes.
STILTS
(like ARCADE)
You may ask one of us a question.
One tells the truth, and the other lies.
Who you ask, remains your discretion.
But if the answer is wrong,
the questioner dies.
Laurie motions to the techno-cities behind her.
LAURIE
(like ARCADE)
One of these cities, is the place you seek.
The Teller of Truths will take you there.
But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak.
And death is certain if you enter, beware.
STILTS
I am The Liar.
Where should I take you?
LAURIE
I am the Truth Teller.
Where should I take
you?
Alex stares at them a moment, utterly confused.
The sky above darkens,
and the wind picks up.
She looks to the horizon, from one city to
another, then back at her friends.
ALEX
(horrified)
What did he do to you?
LAURIE
Is that your question?
ALEX
(realizing)
Wait!
No!
That's not it!
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
Alex doesn't even need to look at her wrist display
anymore.
She begins to pace on the end of the pier, nervously glancing at
the horizon.
And yes, there's the FLASH followed by the SHRIEK/SONIC
BOOM.
ALEX
(to herself)
Think!
I want to go to the City of Truth,
and the Truth Teller is from there...but
which one is which?
The liar...think!
LAURIE
You have no time.
What is your question?
ALEX
(snapping back)
I'm thinking!
LAURIE
You have no time.
THE SCREAMER
is visible now, arms opening to engulf Alex.
Talk about pressure.
ALEX
(she stops pacing)
The liar...Truth Teller...liar...liar...
Alex rushes over to Stilts.
ALEX
Liar.
Did you come from the city on the
left, or the city on the right?
STILTS
(pointing)
I came from the city on the left.
ALEX
(grins)
But you always lie, so you didn't come from
there.
That means the city on the left must
be the City of Truth.
THE SCREAMER
has reached the pier now, rocketing over the wooden slats and shaking the
entire structure...
Alex turns to Laurie.
ALEX
(quickly)
Take me to the city on the left!
Laurie nods and steps aside, making room for Alex to climb into the boat.
She does and...
THE SCREAMER
dissipates just before it reaches Alex.
It turns into mist and vanishes,
the HOWL lingering as an echo long after the Screamer itself has gone.
At once, the boat begins to glide through the water, away from the pier.
Alex gets a last glimpse of Stilts standing in his boat, diminishing as
Alex and Laurie move away from him.
He looks like the loneliest person in
the world.
"LEVEL EIGHT -- CITY OF TRUTH"
As Alex and Laurie near the city, its features become more apparent.
It
is truly a Necropolis, black and angular. It's a shadow on the sunset
horizon, empty of all life and looming above them.
Just then, Alex hears a tiny VOICE.
VOICE
(weak)
Help...help me...
A SMALL FIGURE
bobs in the water about fifty yards in front of them.
It waves it's hands
frantically, sinking below the water's surface, then rising once again.
It's a little BOY.
Alex's boat is going to pass right by the boy.
She grabs hold of the
gunwale and reaches out for him...
ALEX
Grab my hand!
Their hands lock and Alex YANKS the boy out of the water as the boat
cruises by.
THE BOY
can't be more than seven or eight.
Small and frail-looking, he shivers in
her arms.
BOY
(terrified)
Where are we?
Just then the boat comes to a CRASHING stop, slamming into the black rocks
which the city rests on.
Alex and the boy are violently pitched forward
and out of the boat.
They land roughly on a beach of black gravel.
Alex turns.
LAURIE
stands in the boat.
In an instant, night has fallen.
She is a silhouette
in the moonlight.
LAURIE
(in a voice like Death)
The City of Truth.
And Laurie literally fades before their eyes.
In her place, is a small
golden key.
Alex snatches up the key.
Alex turns back to the boy and...
We're on a dark, crowded street lined by decrepit tenements which are
caving in upon themselves.
There is a flash of GREEN LIGHT.
Alex and the boy suddenly appear on the
street in a whirlwind of papers, sans motorcycle, but still sliding
forward at a good thirty miles an hour.
Were it not for their armor,
they'd be torn to shreds.
They skid to a stop under a sputtering
streetlight.
Alex and the boy are still SCREAMING.
Anguish is the word for Alex.
She
clutches her shoulder which is gushing blood and stumbles to her feet.
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!!!!!!
It's her fucking wrist display again and TIME-IS-FUCKING-UP!
Alex SCREAMS, pushed to the absolute breaking point.
BOOM!
Once again the streets begin to vibrate as the Screamer enters the
level.
BOY
It's here!!!
ALEX
(manic)
Oh God...oh god...
THE STREETS --
Impoverished PEOPLE bustle back and forth everywhere. Alex grabs the boy's
hand and all but drags him down the darkened streets.
It becomes a mad,
blind dash through Hell.
She SMASHES into peddlers, stalls, tripping over
or knocking down everything in her path...
The SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer overwhelms everything else.
With
each level, it's gotten louder and louder. Wind is tearing down the
streets...
A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE
spins out of the shadows, landing in front of them.
It's a Ninja, two
swords spinning in its hands.
Instinctively, Alex reaches to her side, and sure enough, there's a gun
there now.
She unholsters it and FIRES in a blind panic.
BLAM!
Down goes the Ninja #1, spouting blood from its chest.
THWUNK!
THWUNK!!!
Two throwing stars imbed themselves into Alex's
chest-plate...
...and Jesus-fucking-Christ, Ninjas are crawling out of the wood-work!
They dive out of the shadows, weapons spinning and glistening in the
moonlight.
Throwing stars are flying like hail now, CLINKING! into the
concrete walls behind Alex and the boy...
ALEX
Shit!!!
ALEX
spins around, shooting indiscriminately into the crowd of bodies.
BLAM!
BLAM!
BLAM!
Ninjas fall right and left, but in no time, twice as many
move in to take their place. They're like the hornet's nest of Alien
monsters, black-clad shadows creeping towards them.
A shot hits the streetlight above, casting a sputtering, strobing light
over the whole scene and adding to the chaos.
The world is shaking apart.
It's the end of everything. It's flashes of
light and noise, nightmares and blood, chaos heaped on chaos...
Alex FIRES her gun again and again and again...
...and in the midst of this mess, here comes the Screamer again.
It
shoots down the street like a guided missile.
Alex stumbles.
The Boy drags at her arm, trying to pull her up...
THE BOY
Come on!!!
Alex is crying, hysterical.
She turns and sees the Screamer bearing down
on her, just like Nick did before her was ripped to shreds.
The boy is yelling something.
Alex focuses...
THE BOY
The doorway!
It's here!!!
THE BOY
is pulling back a manhole cover.
BLUE LIGHT
issues up from below.
Before Alex can stop him, the boy disappears down the hole.
Alex has one last chance.
She throws herself at the hole even as the
Screamer reaches her.
A clawed hand wraps around her leg.
Alex FIRES
into the hand.
The hand is severed!
She's falling!
Falling into
darkness...
"LEVEL TEN -- BAD BRAINS"
CUT TO:
LEVEL TEN, TECHNO-SKYSCRAPER -- NIGHT
ON ALEX AND THE BOY
as they blink into existence on this level.
Alex rises, shaking badly.
Her armor is battered, burnt, covered with grim and blood...it's
impossible to tell who's blood, though.
She looks like she's just walked
out of a slaughter-house.
A bone-jarring HUMMING is heard.
Alex turns...
ARCADE'S BRAIN
looms over her, all glass and black steel.
It reaches into the sky and
keeps on going.
Massive.
Tendrils of crackling ENERGY race up and down
it, BUZZING.
And as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitely
appears to be alive.
TWO GLASS DOORS
swing open in invitation.
A red carpet rolls out from within the
building, rolling by itself.
Emerald City time. The carpet unfurls
completely, ending just at Alex's feet.
Above the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time,
"THIS...IS...THE...PLACE".
Fucking-A.
Alex offers a tired, near-maddened laugh.
It's all she can do anymore.
THE BOY
looks up at Alex, frightened.
BOY
We have to go in there, don't we?
Alex nods.
She takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpet
towards the entrance of ARCADE'S brain.
DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAWN
Outside, light is just beginning to creep its way back into the world.
Alex glances up and can't help but notice the streetlight fading out as
the sun returns.
She points and laughs.
WE BEGIN TO RISE UP,
as Nick and the others join them.
Everyone is laughing now.
It's
uncontrollable.
This is positive.
Life affirming.
And hell, we should
probably wrap this thing up on that note.
We should...
...but we won't.
WE WATCH
as a series of dissolves portray the crowd of people leaving, bit by bit,
until only our original group is left.
THE GROUP
as they make their way down the street and away from The Inferno.
GREG
So how did you do it, Alex?
ALEX
Well, it's a long story...
Alex catches Nick's eye briefly, and he smiles.
Whatever happened between
them is over now.
Friends again.
Suddenly Alex stops in her tracks, a look of concern washing over her
face.
NICK
What is it?
ALEX
I just thought of something.
If we came
back from the game...
(turning to Nick)
...what if ARCADE did too?
A beat as the group mulls it over.
Then Greg shakes his head.
GREG
Nah.
You won, right?
You played by the
rules.
Greg's right.
Alex grins and dismisses the thought.
ALEX
Okay.
Forget I ever said it.
The group moves away from us once more.
STILTS
So start at the beginning...
LAURIE
Give her a chance, will you?
STILTS
I am giving her a chance.
Why don't you
get off my back?
GREG
(annoyed)
Guys...
DISSOLVE TO:
