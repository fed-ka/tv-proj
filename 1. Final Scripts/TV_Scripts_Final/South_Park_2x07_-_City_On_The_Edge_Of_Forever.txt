               EXT. SOUTH PARK ROAD - DAY

               The school bus drives up a snowy mountain road.

               INT. SCHOOL BUS

               Ms. Crabtree drives the bus as the kids all throw stuff and 
               yell and scream in the background.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         BE QUIET BACK THERE!!! These roads 
                         are slick!

               The kids quiet down a little bit.

                                     STAN
                         Hey, Cartman.

               Cartman leans around from his seat.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What?

                                     STAN
                         Are you gonna share any of that cake 
                         with the rest of us?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hmmm, let me think... No.

                                     KYLE
                         Come on, fat ass, you shouldn't be 
                         eating all that cake anyway!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Mmm... It's chocolatey and delightful.

                                     STAN
                         Give us some, Cartman!

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         BE QUIET BACK THERE!!!

                                     KYLE
                         Woa, dude, the road is really snowy 
                         out there.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, the road is always snowy.

                                     KYLE
                         I know, but it's REALLY snowy today.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Mmmm... I can't possibly finish this 
                         WHOLE cake... Yes I can!

                                     STAN
                         SHUT UP, CARTMAN!

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Okay that does, it!!

               Ms. Crabtree stops the bus. She opens a small box, inside 
               there is a small rabbit and a gun.

               Crabtree holds the rabbit by the ears and puts the gun to 
               it's head.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         YOU ALL BE QUIET OR THE CUTE LITTLE 
                         BUNNY DIES!!!

               The kids are all horrified. They quiet down immediately. 
               Satisfied, Crabtree puts the bunny and the gun back in the 
               box and drives on.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, she always tries to quiet us 
                         down by threatening to kill that 
                         bunny... But I wonder if she ever 
                         would.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh she would, dude. She would.

               The bus comes to a stop again. Crabtree looks ahead to see 
               that the road in front of her is closed. A large sign on a 
               barricade reads 'ROAD CLOSED DUE TO AVALANCHE'.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Aaaahh. Oh, for Christ's sake, I 
                         don't believe this!

               Now she sees another sign, DETOUR, with an arrow pointing up 
               a very narrow, very steep, very dangerous road.

               Crabtree takes the detour, and the bus makes its way up the 
               hill, heading for certain doom.

                                     STAN
                         Come on, fat boy, give us some cake 
                         now.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I can not possibly eat one more bite 
                         of its chocolatey goodness... Oh 
                         wait, wait, wait, try --

               Cartman takes a huge bite.

                                     KYLE
                         DAMMIT CARTMAN!! YOU ARE SUCH A FAT 
                         FUCK!!!

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!

               Crabtree looks up in the rearview mirror, and doesn't see 
               the big 180 degree turn in front of her.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         OH OH!

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               The bus slips off the road, and flips over down the side of 
               the mountain.

               INT. BUS -

               The kids all yell and scream. Ms. Crabtree screams, as the 
               bus goes flipping over and over. Cartman tries, with 
               difficulty, to continue eating his cake.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               The bus continues to do flips. Finally, it lands, right-side 
               up in a fast moving river.

               INT. BUS -

                                     KIDS
                         Aaah!!!

                                     KYLE
                         I'M SCARED!!

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         BE QUIET KID!

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

               The bus floats helplessly down the river. All the kids have 
               their heads out the windows, screaming.

               The river is moving faster and faster, the bus goes an amazing 
               distance. Finally, it reaches a waterfall where it plunges.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         AAAAHGHGhGH!!!!

               EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

               A group of properly dressed bird watchers happily hike through 
               the forest.

                                     BIRD WATCHER
                         And right up here, you can see a red 
                         bellied chickadee. They're indigenous 
                         to this area.

               A couple old people snap some photos.

               They give each other quizzical looks when a very strange 
               sound seems to be coming closer.

               Just then, the school bus flips through frame. All the kids 
               on board screaming as they go. As quickly as it came, it 
               disappears.

                                     OLD LADY
                         What was that?

                                     BIRD WATCHER
                         What was what?

               EXT. RIVER

               The bus flips into yet another river, where it hurls further 
               into the unknown.

               Finally, after several shots, the bus washes up onto a piece 
               of dry land, where it teeters dangerously over a huge abyss.

               INT. SCHOOL BUS

               Cartman shoves the last piece of cake into his mouth.

                                     CARTMAN
                         All done!

               Cartman turns around, and sees that all the other children 
               are catatonic. They don't blink. Their eyes are huge.

               Ms. Crabtree wrenches herself out of her seat and looks over 
               the heavily damaged bus.

               A few kids start crying and getting up.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!!

               But the kids are too panicked, they get louder.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         I SAID QUIET OR ELSE I KILL THE 
                         BUNNY!!

               The kids all get quiet.

                                     STAN
                         Where are we?

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         I have no idea.

                                     STAN
                         I don't think we're in a very safe 
                         spot.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, what are we supposed to do?!

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Just keep your traps shut, I'll 
                         consult the manual.

               Crabtree grabs a HUGE manual. It says 'BUSDRIVERS MANUAL'. 
               She flips through the pages to find 'Stranded'.

               ANGLE - BOOK

               IT SAYS 'REFER TO VIDEO #35'

               Crabtree throws down the book and opens a small cabinet where 
               a lot of videos are.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ms. Crabtree --

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         SHUT UP, KID! I have to watch a 
                         training video!!

               Crabtree slams the tape into a small VHS and watches a small 
               monitor.

               ANGLE - MONITOR

               The cheesy video begins. It is like an airline takeoff video. 
               ** Note - maybe we should really shoot this, live action on 
               video **

                                     NARRATOR
                         Hello, and welcome to tape seven of 
                         the busdrivers video guidebook. 'What 
                         to do if you become stranded'.

               Now, we see the narrator, a VERY plastic looking man with a 
               fake smile.

                                     NARRATOR
                         By now, you've calmed down the 
                         children, and kept order by using 
                         the 'Keep Quiet or I'll kill the 
                         bunny' technique. Now it's time to 
                         get help.

               Crabtree watches intently.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The most important thing to remember 
                         is that the children will be safe as 
                         long as they stay on the bus. So do 
                         NOT, under any circumstances let any 
                         children off the bus. The best way 
                         to achieve this is to tell them 
                         something like, 'a big scary monster 
                         will eat you, if you step off the 
                         bus'.

               Crabtree turns to the kids.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         KIDS! DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS! IF 
                         YOU DO, A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT 
                         YOU!

               Stan and Kyle look at each other, a little scared.

               Ms. Crabtree goes back to her video.

                                     NARRATOR
                         That's right, with the children 
                         properly subdued, you can leave the 
                         bus and go out looking for assistance. 
                         And remember your busdriver's code: 
                         Sit down and shut up.

               Crabtree grabs her coat and throws it on.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         I'm going for help! I'll be back as 
                         soon as I can. Remember, DON'T GET 
                         OFF THE BUS OR A BIG SCARY MONSTER 
                         WILL EAT YOU!!

               With that, Crabtree steps off the bus and disappears. Then, 
               a little kid in a red shirt (think Star Trek) looks out the 
               window.

                                     KID IN RED SHIRT
                         Hey, why doesn't the scary monster 
                         eat HER?

                                     KYLE
                         Cause, dumbass, scary monsters don't 
                         eat big fat smelly bitches.

               In the very far distance, we hear Crabtree's voice.

                                     MS. CRABTREE (O.S.)
                         WHAT DID YOU SAYyyyy?!?!

               Kyle sticks his head out the window.

                                     KYLE
                         I SAID LARRY KING WON'T GRANT ME 
                         THREE WISHES.

                                     MS. CRABTREE (O.S.)
                         Oh.

                                     STAN
                         Man, this is not good. She could 
                         have at least left the heat on.

               EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

               Ms. Crabtree climbs down some large rocks towards what she 
               hopes to be a road.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Had to happen to me, didn't it?

               Finally, she gets to a road.

               EXT./INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               A big, burly lecherous TRUCKER drives along the deserted 
               road, singing.

                                     TRUCKER
                              (singing)
                         Looking for love in all the wrong 
                         places. Looking for love in too many --

               Suddenly, he notices Ms. Crabtree hitchhiking.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oooh, it's supper time. Come to papa.

               He checks himself in the mirror, slicks back his hair and 
               pulls his rig over to Ms. Crabtree.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Hello, little lady. Going my way?

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Shut up and help me in to this thing.

               The trucker is taken back by her abrasiveness.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oh, uh --

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Come on. I haven't got all day.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Uh, alright, sure. Of course.

               He helps her into the cab.

               The trucker looks down at Crabtree voluptuous thighs.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Take me to the nearest town and make 
                         it snappy, you freak-ass crackpot.

               The big, burly trucker now cowers under Ms. Crabtree's 
               assaults.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Uh, yes ma'am. Right away, ma'am. So 
                         uh... What's a fragile little doe 
                         like yourself doing out on a night 
                         like this?

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Look mister, I've got a busload of 
                         kids trapped up on that pass. I need 
                         a crane, helicopters all that crap. 
                         Here, let me have some of your 
                         aspirin.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Ma'am those are actually rufies.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Rufies, aspirin, right now I don't 
                         give a rats ass.

               Crabtree scarfs the rufies down.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         How far to the nearest town?

                         God dammit, how long is this gonna 
                         take?

               The kid in the red shirt is sweating heavily.

                                     KID IN RED SHIRT
                         She's never coming back! Don't you 
                         get it?! She's left us here to die 
                         like pigs!

                         Calm down dude, you're upsetting 
                         Kenny!

               Kenny shoots Kyle a quizzical look.

                                     KID IN RED SHIRT
                         I can't take it anymore! I have to 
                         get out of here!

               The kid walks to the front of the bus.

                                     STAN
                         No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree 
                         said! There's a big black scary 
                         monster out there!

                                     KID IN RED SHIRT
                         Well, I'm not going to sit here and 
                         wait to die with the rest of you!

               The kid opens the bus doors.

                                     KID IN RED SHIRT
                         If I make it back, I'll send help.

                         Don't do it, kid.

               But the kid steps off the bus.

               The boys all run to the windows to get a look.

               EXT. SCHOOL BUS

               They see the kid look left, then right, then start walking 
               straight ahead.

                                     STAN
                         Hmmm... Maybe Ms. Crabtree DID make 
                         up the stuff about the big black 
                         monster --

               The kid stops by some trees, turns around and waves at the 
               he kids on the bus.

                                     MONSTER

               EXT. SCHOOL BUS

               The boys watch on, horrified, as a HUGE, horrible monster 
               scoops up the kid in the red shirt with one enormous claw.

                                     KYLE
                         HOLY CRAP, DUDE!!

               The beast raises the screaming child up to its mouth, and 
               swallows it whole. Then the beast scurries back into the 
               forrest.

               INT. BUS -

               The children continue to watch, horrified. Suddenly, there 
               is a loud splitting noise followed by a THUD against the 
               windshield of the bus.

               ANGLE ON THE SIDE WINDOW:

               A small skeleton with a red shirt slides down the glass.

                                     KIDS
                         AAAGHGAH!!!

                         Gross!

               INT. SCHOOL BUS

               Back on the bus, the children are all silent and wide-eyed. 
               Slowly, and quietly, they make their way back to their seats. 
               Finally, Stan speaks.

                                     STAN
                         Well, I guess nobody else will be 
                         getting off the bus.

               The crowd goes nuts as Kathie Lee is driven in on her Pope

                         She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. 
                         She's some kind of Alien.

               BANG!! The bullet hits Cathy Lee right between the eyes. The 
               back of her head blows apart, and her body is sent flying 
               backwards and an Alien comes out of her body.

               The crowd GASPS!!

               Mr. Garrison fires off a few rounds, killing the alien.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         See? I told ya.

               Stan and Wendy shrug. Stan grabs Wendy and kisses her 
               passionately.

               Grandpa is pursuing Death in his wheelchair.

               shit out of him.

               Just then, a huge hole is ripped from the roof of the bus. 
               The kids all SCREAM as a giant, clawlike hand scoops up Kenny

               out laughing.

               Crabtree shakes her head and walks off the stage.

                                     JAY LENO
                         Let's hear it for Ms. Crabtree! What 
                         an up and comer!!

               Crabtree walks over to the Trucker.

                         That was great, ma'am.

                         Was it? Does it even matter?

                                     TRUCKER
                         What do you mean?

                         Success is hollow, Mitch. Hollow 
                         like a dead tree. I think it's time 
                         for me to give it up.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Are you sure?

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         I'm sure... Let's get a cup of coffee.

               The trucker smiles and walks out with Ms. Crabtree.

               EXT. PERILOUS CLIFF - DAY

               Now it's daytime, and the kids are all still sitting on the 
               bus, with a huge hole ripped off the top.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I wonder when the monster's gonna 
                         come back to feed again!

               The kids all exchange looks.

                         Remember that time... Fonzie jumped 
                         over the busses with his motorcycle?

               EXT. AL'S DINER - HAPPY DAYS - DAY

               Everybody is gathered in the parking lot of Al's. Fonzie is 
               dressed like Evil Kneival on his motorcycle.

               Fonzie revs the engine.

                                     JOANIE
                         GO FONZIE!!

                         Ayyyyyy.

               The boys cheer Fonzie on.

                                     CARTMAN
                         YOU CAN DO IT, FONZIE!

                                     STAN
                         WE BELIEVE IN YOU FONZ!!

                                     FONZIE
                         Ayyyyy.

               Fonzie gives a THUMBS UP, then puts on his helmet. He revs 
               the engine some more, and then hauls ass towards a large 
               ramp in front of the busses.

               Fonzie JUMPS! He clears the busses!

               Everybody cheers!

               But when Fonzie lands, his bike spins out of control! Fonzie's 
               bike flies into Kenny, crushing him instantly.

                                     FONZIE
                         Ayyyyy,

               Fonzie pulls out an ice cream cone and starts eating it.

                                     STAN
                         Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

               Cartman laughs, but this time by himself. Stan and Kyle are 
               just staring at him.

                                     STAN
                         You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the

                         hours ago from that monster! How 
                         could he have died back then too?

               Cartman thinks.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh yeah... I guess that doesn't make 
                         sense...

               CrANK!!! The boys all look around in a panic as the bus starts 
               to TILT downward!!

               The bus slides a few feet, and tilts further down into the

               Again night has fallen. The bus goes CREEEEK as it tilts 
               further down the slope.

               INT. SCHOOL BUS

               The kids are running up and down the isles, changing seats.

                         No, that's too much!!

               Some of the kids run to the front. The bus balances itself.

                         wait to die with the rest of you!

               The kid opens the bus doors.

               The boys all run to the windows to get a look.

               EXT. SCHOOL BUS

               They see the kid look left, then right, then start walking 
               straight ahead.

               The boys watch on, horrified, as a HUGE, horrible monster 
               scoops up the kid in the red shirt with one enormous claw.

               The beast raises the screaming child up to its mouth, and 
               swallows it whole. Then it pulls out a large scooper and a 
               box.

               A huge hole is ripped in the top of the bus, and ice cream 
               cones are dropped all around.

               The kids all merrily eat the ice cream.

                         Ha, ha!

               INT. TELEVISION SET - DAY

               The MUSIC is continuous. The South Park parents, all wearing 
               "Runaway Come Home" T-shirts, are on risers wearing 
               headphones. Microphones hang down to record them.

               QUINCY JONES stands in front of them, conducting as they 
               sing the chorus:

                                     PARENTS
                         Runaway come home, we love you just 
                         as you are. Runaway come home, we're 
                         sorry things went this far.

               INT. BUS -

               The kids now all look embarrassed.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, did it ever occur to them to 
                         just LOOK for us?

                                     CLYDE
                         I hope my dad doesn't sing.

               INT. BUS - DAY

               The kids are all waiting around like before.

               Nobody says anything for a long time. Finally, Cartman speaks.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey... Do you guys remember the time 
                         I found out who my father was?

               Stan and Kyle look at each other.

                                     STAN
                         Boy, do I...

                         somebody in this room...

               Everybody looks nervous.

                                     MEPHESTO

                              (skeptical)
                         Wait a minute... I thought your father 
                         was your mother 'cause she had a 
                         penis.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What? HEY!! YOU SON OF A BITCH!! 
                         I'LL KICK YOU IN THE NUTS!!

               Cartman rushes Kyle.

                                     STAN
                         Cartman, NO!

               As Cartman makes his way down the isle, the weight of the 
               bus shifts and --

               CRACK!!

                                     KIDS
                         AAAGHGHGGHG!!!

                         Oh, no!!

               The kids all scurry around as the front end of the bus raises 
               itself.

               EXT. BUS

               ***MAKE THIS LIKE TITANIC***

               It slides off the cliff and spirals towards the ground. We 
               can see the children's horrified faces as they plunge to the 
               depths.

                                     KIDS
                         AAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhhhh!!!!!

                                         EPILOGUE

               The bus falls and falls, and finally lands in a HUGE container 
               of ice cream!

               The kids all sit there stunned for a minute...

                                     STAN
                         HEY! WE LANDED IN ICE CREAM!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Wait, wait, wait... this doesn't 
                         make sense... This whole thing doesn't 
                         make any sense... I must be...

               INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Cartman jolts awake.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AGAHGHAGH!!!

               Cartman catches his breath and looks around.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh man, what a weird dream!

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                         Are you okay, hon?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Mom... I just dreamt that me and 
                         Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped 
                         on our bus. And we were talking about 
                         everything that happened to us, except 
                         that it was all wrong. And everything 
                         ended with us eating ice cream.

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                         Oh... well... would you like some 
                         beetles for breakfast?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes, please.

               Cartman and his mother start scarfing down crunchy, live 
               beetles.

                                     CARTMAN

                         Beetles are good with ice cream!

               Mom takes out some ice cream, just as we --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. STAN'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Stan jolts awake.

                                     STAN
                         AAAGHGHGH!!!

               Stan looks around.

                                     STAN
                         Oh, dude! What a nightmare!

               Stan picks up the phone near his bed and dials.

                                     KYLE
                         Hello?

                                     STAN
                         Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.

                                     KYLE
                         Really?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt 
                         that we were all trapped on a bus 
                         and then he dreamt that we talked 
                         about things that had happened only 
                         they were all wrong, and then he and 
                         his mother ate beetles.

                                     KYLE
                         Dude... That's a pretty fucked up 
                         dream.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah... I must be having some real 
                         emotional problems.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, me and Cartman and Kenny are 
                         going down to Happy Burger. You wanna 
                         come?

                                     STAN
                         Sure. I definitely don't want to 
                         sleep anymore. See ya later.

               Stan gets out of bed.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Crabtree is in the lily covered forest with her lover.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         I want to thank you for making me 
                         feel alive again, Marcus.

                                     MARCUS
                         Ms. Crabtree...

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         What is it? What's wrong?

                                     MARCUS
                         You realize I can't stay. None of 
                         this is real. It's all been a little 
                         eight year old's dream.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Oh I know... I know, Marcus. But let 
                         me just pretend as long as I can.

                                     MARCUS
                         Sure.

               Marcus puts his arm around Ms. Crabtree. The camera PULLS 
               BACK as they are silhouetted against a gorgeous sky.

                                         THE END
