 
      THE BLACKNESS SPLITS revealing the inside of a CANDLE LIT 
      TENT as Soldier #1 is escorted in by a battle hardened 
      COLONEL who stops our young conscript a few paces back from a 
      COMMAND DESK. Behind it stands a MAN, his back to us, barely 
      in the light. His head turns slightly to give a glimmer of 
      an unmistakable SILHOUETTE -- 

      GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON... but just in case: 

                                    SOLDIER #1 
                    General Washington? Sir... I have 
                    a report from the front. 
 
      HOLD... then, ETHEREAL LIGHT flutters into frame, 
        revealing... ANGELS. We re looking at a CEILING FRESCO in: 
 
 
 
      Crane is lying on a cot somewhere, in BAD SHAPE. We re in a 
      CHURCH filled with wounded soldiers, SURGEONS in bloody 
      aprons scramble about with NURSES, triaging men. One of the 
      nurses is KATRINA CRANE, 30, stunningly beautiful -- she 
      looks up, SEES CRANE and RUSHES to him -- barely able to 
      breathe as she realizes the terrible truth: HE S DYING.  4. 
 
 

                                    KATRINA 
                    -- Ichabod, nonono -- 
                          (calls out) 
                    Doctor! Please, help him! 
 
    A DOCTOR rushes over, examines the wound... then shakes his 
      head gravely. Katrina breaks, TEARS flowing. Crane fights 
      to anchor himself to the world a little longer, as the doctor 
      rushes off to the next victim. 
 
      She pushes hair back from his face with trembling hands: 

      He manages to wipe a TEAR from her cheek: 

                                  CRANE 
                    We always knew Freedom was worth 
                    dying for... 
 
      And though it breaks her heart, Katrina nods... 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    Whatever secret you wished to tell 
                    me... better tell me now... 
 
      ON KATRINA. Holding onto something so big that here, now, it 
      feels impossible to say. Looks at him, her heart in her 
      eyes. Debating some CHOICE. Finally, she leans down and 
      KISSES him, so gently... then WHAM: puts her hand ON HIS 
      WOUND -- he GASPS and again, SMASH TO BLACK: 
 
 
 
      These come in FLASHES from Crane s POV: IMAGES OVERCRANKED -- 
      candlelight -- a HAND dips into a jar of WHITE GREASE PAINT -- 
      fingers draw SYMBOLS on his chest -- we re SUSPENDED above a 
      MUD PIT by a STRETCH OF LINEN lashed around wooden posts -- 
      the weird CHANTING comes from HOODED FIGURES all around us as 
      our body s LOWERED, disappearing into the THICK MUD. The 
      WHISPERING BUILDS IN VOLUME until it reaches a CRESCENDO and: 
 
      QUIET... What just happened? 
 
 
 
      PUUUUUH! CRANE S EYES SNAP OPEN AS HE GASPS AIR, FINDING 
      HIMSELF CAKED WITH MUD. Tearing free, he finds he s wearing 
      linen breech pants but no shirt, torso slick with goo. 
 
      We re in a VERY DIFFERENT SPACE.  5. 
 
 

      And his wound? HEALED AND SCARRED. He tumbles out onto HARD 
      GROUND, knocking over JARS filled with WEIRD ITEMS placed 
        ritualistically around the mud grave... murky liquids, a BIRD 
      FETUS... Where the hell is he? How d he get here? 
 
      He stammers up -- NO SHOES. We RISE UP HIGH ABOVE HIM to 
      find... the grave s in the CENTER of a CHALK-DRAWN PENTAGRAM. 
      He squints at LIGHT BEAMS cutting through rotted WOOD PLANKS 
      boarded over some kind of EXIT ahead. Begins weakly to 
      stagger up a set of STONES -- makeshift STEPS. Puts his 
      SHOULDER into the planks -- SLAMS until they GIVE and: 
 
 
 
      He enters. Empty.  Moves down the aisle, sensing something 
      about this place. A beat... then his look goes UP: ON THE  
      CEILING IS THE SAME ANGEL FRESCO FROM THE WAR. This is where 
      he was brought during triage! 
 
                                  A VOICE 
                    Sir? Can I hel-- 
 
      STARTLED, Ichabod WHIRLS rattlesnake-fast, hand LASHING OUT 
      in self-defense pinning A MAN to the wall by the throat -- 
      It s a REVEREND: ALFRED KNAPP, 60 s, HEAVY SCOTTISH ACCENT: 
 
                                  REV. KNAPP 
                    There s -- money -- in the tithing 
                    box -- it s -- all there is -- 
 
      ON CRANE, adrenaline pumping, CLARITY lands: a reverend s 
      collar is something he recognizes. Instantly lets go -- 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    For-- forgive me, Father... 
 
      But now Knapp looks at Crane s face -- seems to RECOGNIZE it? 
 
                                  REV. KNAPP 
                    Wait... I can help you-- 
 
      But Crane s already OUT the door. Off the stricken reverend: 
 
 
 
      The cruiser pulls up.Abbie and Grey get out, hear the HORSES 
      braying in the stable barn. Abbie looks to the MAIN HOUSE.
     PITCH DARK. Strange. Grey flicks on his FLASHLIGHT:  10. 
 
 

                                  GREY 
                    Go see if Jimmy s home. 
 
      She nods and they SEPARATE: Abbie to the house, Grey to the 
      stables. WITH ABBIE, AS SHE APPROACHES THE DARK BACK PORCH. 
      Puts a hand on her pistol grip and calls in: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Mr. Oglevie? It s Detective 
                    Archer... 
 
      Nothing. Now she NOTICES an old PICKUP TRUCK parked beside 
      the house, the driver s side door has been left WIDE OPEN... 
 
 
 
      Grey enters to the sound of FEAR: horses are VIOLENTLY 
      KICKING against their confined spaces. Hanging TOOLS above 
      CLANK and CLACK -- it s LOUD and SCARY in here -- 
 
 
 
      Grey tries to hear that over his walkie, but it s MUFFLED by 
      the THRASHING HORSES -- keys back: 
 
                                  GREY (INTO WALKIE) 
                    Abbie, say again, over -- 

      Her voice cuts IN and OUT over the walkie -- 

                                  ABBIE 
                    I-- weap-- somethin-- wron-- 
 
      Suddenly Grey REACTS to a NOISE: someone s inside the barn -- 
      through the SLATTED STALL, Grey sees a FIGURE by a WHITE 
      HORSE -- STEALING IT -- WHISPERS URGENTLY into the walkie: 
 
                                  GREY (INTO WALKIE) 
                    Standby, 484, suspect s in the 
                    barn... stealing a horse...  11. 
 
 

 
                                  ABBIE (OVER WALKIE) 
                    -- someone cut off his head! 
 
      As Grey REACTS, so does the MYSTERIOUS FIGURE through the 
      slats, hearing her voice ECHO -- Grey levels his weapon: 
 
                                  GREY 
                    This is the sheriff! Step outta 
                    the stall where I can see you, now! 
 
      As the MYSTERIOUS FIGURE emerges from behind the wall, we go 
      CLOSE ON GREY -- seeing what WE DO NOT SEE, his eyes BULGE: 
 
                                  GREY (CONT D) 
                    Jesus God... 
 
      MOVING ANGLE: AN OVER-THE-SHOULDER SHOT OF THE MYSTERIOUS 
      FIGURE BECOMES AN OVER-THE-NECK SHOT BECAUSE... HE S HEADLESS 
      (and from now on, that s exactly what we ll call him) -- but 
      we DON T see him in full, NOT YET, as Grey FIRES at Headless 
      to no avail -- a double sided AXE spins upright INTO FRAME: 
 
 
 
      OFFICER ANDY DUNN, likeable, 30 s, is hearing this over his 
      radio in SHOCK -- instantly hits the SIREN and pulls a 
      SCREECHING U-TURN in the middle of main street -- 
 
      ANGLE, THROUGH WINDSHIELD: as the cruiser swerves around, 
      CRANE IS SUDDENLY REVEALED IN THE HEADLIGHTS! Looking every 
      bit a suspect as he emerges from an ALLEY -- Dunn SLAMS the 
      brakes as Crane starts to BACK AWAY, panicked -- Dunn leaps 
      from the car, gun up: 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    POLICE! GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES, 
                    INTERLACE YOUR FINGERS AND PUT  EM 
                    ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD! 
 
      Crane s smart enough to know he has NO CHOICE. So he does, 
      as Dunn PUSHES him to the cement, ROUGHLY CUFFS HIM -- 
 
 
 
      Stillness. A glass of water on a desk... and then ABBIE S 
      TREMBLING HAND picks it up, she gulps it. Only beginning to 
      know the grief she ll come to feel. She s seated, surrounded 
      by fellow COPS. Across from her is Dunn with a kind smile: 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    Abbie... I need you to try and 
                    focus. Just for a minute, then 
                    we ll get you home. You saw the 
                    man who killed Grey and Oglevie? 
 
      She blinks, wishing her traumatized mind were playing tricks. 
 
                                  DUNN (CONT D) 
                    We might ve caught him. Picked him 
                    up fleeing on foot a mile from the 
                    farm. He s in the other room. 
                                  (MORE)  13. 
 

                                  DUNN (CONT D) 
                    We need to know if it s the guy, 
                    can you do that? 
 
      Off Abbie, wide-eyed -- 
 
 
 
      KA-CLINK: a door opens and CRANE, in a cell, looks up at us 
      through bars. Abbie and the cops enter an outer area. 
      ANTICIPATION. She meets eyes with Crane. A STRANGER. Beat: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    It isn t him. 
 
      Voice EMOTIONAL. Hard for them to tell if she s losing it... 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    You re sure. Take a closer look... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Andy. I m sure. 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    What d he look like? Can you 
                    describe his face? We ll get a 
                    sketch artist. 

      Uh... Abbie just looks at all the cops looking at her: 

                                  ABBIE 
                    I didn t really... get a good look. 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    Then how d you know this isn t him? 
 
      What s she gonna say: a headless horseman killed Grey? And 
      for reasons we ll understand, she doesn t want to believe it. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    ... I just know. The man I saw was 
                    wearing some kind of... old 
                    military uniform. All red. There 
                    were medals -- 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    -- Medals? What kind? 
 

                      ABBIE CRANE 
      Military. Crosses and... a (interrupting) 
      lion with a sword... -- Did he carry a broad-axe? 
 

      His voice SNAPS them around. What? Abbie and Crane LOCK 
      EYES. She moves closer to him behind the bars, faces CLOSE:  14. 
 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    How did you know that? 
 
      Crane s mind tumbles, trying to make SENSE of this... 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    It... can t be... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    What can t be? You know who he is? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                          (a beat, then) 
                    The medal you described is the 
                       House-order of the Golden Lion.  
                    A Hessian badge of honor awarded 
                    for multiple kills. But... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Hey: who is he? Where s he from? 
                    When s the last time you saw him? 
 
      He looks up at her. LONG beat. And finally... 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    When I cut off his head. 
 
      ON ABBIE. Holy. Shit. They look at each other, BOTH trying 
      to understand the insanity of what s happening... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Who are you? 
 

                                                              AND WE SMASH TO:

      FLASH! CLOSE ON CRANE as a PHOTO is taken of him: he blinks, 
        disoriented. He s never seen a CAMERA. He s FINGERPRINTED, 
      handed NEW CLOTHES. Looks at the strange threads. 
 
 
 
      Abbie enters, hasn t slept, her head SWIMMING LIKE MAD. Sits 
      at Grey s DESK, seeing FRAMED PHOTOS. One of Grey and Abbie; 
      she s younger, a new cadet. Abbie stares, fights everything 
      to just keep it together... a KNOCK and she looks up, wipes 
      her eyes: DUNN in the doorway, compassionate: 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    I know what he meant to you. To 
                    all of us, but... especially you. 
 
      She stares, torn. Wants to tell him the truth. Quietly... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    In high school, when... everything 
                    happened. With me and my sister. 
                    You were the only one who believed 
                    me. 
 

                                  DUNN 
                          (beat, confused by the non- 
                            sequitur) 
                    I still do. Why re you thinking 
                    about that now? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    What if... I am crazy? 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    ... Hey: you re not. And you re 
                    not your sister. You wouldn t ve 
                    made it all the way to The Academy 
                    if you were. 
 
      She nods a little, so lost. He moves CLOSER... and maybe we 
      sense his feelings for her run deeper than friendship: 
 
                                  DUNN (CONT D) 
                    Look, I m not telling you to ignore 
                    all this. How could you? I m just 
                    saying, as a friend who knows where 
                    you came from... you can t let it 
                    stop you from where you re headed.  16. 
 
 

      ON ABBIE. Suddenly her drive to leave feels a lot less sure: 
 
                                  CRANE (V.O., PRELAP) 
                    I ve done nothing wrong -- 
 
 
 
      Crane sits in his new clothes, CUFFED to the table, pissed, a 
      man used to fighting authority -- as OFFICER TEDDY PRICE, 
      30 s, preps a completely alien LAPTOP POLYGRAPH MACHINE: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    I need to get word to my wife -- 
 
                                  PRICE 
                    First I need to ask you some 
                      questions. This is a polygraph

                    The machine knows? What the hell kind 
                    of place is this? Are you an elected 
                      magistrate?  Is this an

      He s looking at the CCTV CAMERA in the ceiling corner, off

      Officers in rows, Abbie included; at a podium, LT. LUIS

                    last night s double homicide. I 
                    know you all worked with Sheriff 
                    Grey... my condolences. Given the 
                    brutal and unusual nature of this 
                    crime, the press won t be able to 
                    resist talking about cults and 
                    devil worshippers. I don t want 
                    any of you engaging in that kind of

      Officers shake their heads at Crane s outlandish claims...

      BACK TO MENDEZ IN THE PEN: 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    Although we have a suspect in

                                  CRANE 
                    I was brought to a church. I was

                    now I want to see my wife. She s a 
                    civilian nurse in the 37th 
                    Regiment, I need to find her. 
 
      ON ABBIE. Reacting. His longing, along with everything else 
      he s saying, seems painfully real. Price placates:

                                  CRANE 
                    I could answer if I knew where the

                    indignity of strapping you to this 
                    damn machine! WHERE AM I?! 
 
      Price stares. At Crane, at the spike, which hasn t moved. 
 
                                  PRICE 
                    The question isn t where... it s 
                    when.  Good news is, you won the 
                    war. Bad news is... that was 
                    almost two hundred and fifty years 
                    ago. 
 
      ON CRANE. Falling down the rabbit hole, trying to accept the 
      IMPOSSIBLE. Price pulls out... A DOLLAR BILL. Slides it 
      across the table to Crane, who picks it up, seeing GEORGE  
        WASHINGTON S FACE there. Disbelief. Words that DON T 
      COMPUTE:  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  Looks up at Price, 
      who stares back skeptically:

                    Welcome to the 21st century, Mr. 
                    Crane. 
 
 
 
      Price exits to a waiting Mendez. Abbie on the periphery, 
      looking for her moment to intervene: 
 
                                  PRICE 
                    Not one spike. He s either 
                      delusional or has some kind of 
                    amnesia -- could be setting the 
                    table for an insanity defense.  20. 
 
 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    Hold him for 72 hours at the psych 
                    unit, I want a full e-val. 
 
      In a RUSH, Mendez begins to walk away, Abbie quickly FOLLOWS 
      him down the corridor -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Sir? Sir? I m Abbie Archer, I 
                    was Sheriff Grey s partner. 

      He registers that, but continues on into THE BULLPEN: 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    Yes, I m very sorry for your loss. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Thank you, Sir, but if I could ask: 
                    before we send that man to the 
                    psych unit, may I have a chance to 
                      interrogate him myself? 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                      Absolutely not -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Sir, prelim forensics found no 
                    trace evidence connecting him to 
                    the farm, and he described the 
                      appearance of the man I saw in 
                    perfect detail. He could be 
                    helpful. 
 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    -- or he could be the killer, we 
                    both know the polygraph s trickable 
                    and he just admitted to beheading 
                    someone. He needs professional 
                      attention, which you re not 
                    qualified to give after the trauma 
                    you ve just suffered, for which, as 
                    I said, I am very sorry. But the 
                    answer s no. Go home and get some 
                    sleep. 
 
      He moves on. Instantly she calculates options -- smart as 
      hell -- shifts gears into  appeasing  and pursues tactfully: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    May I at least be the one to 
                    transport him, Sir? My 
                      questions ll be limited to the 20 
                    minutes it takes to get there. 
                    What can that hurt? 
                                  (MORE)  21. 
 

                                  ABBIE (CONT'D) 
                          (then, the kicker) 
                    If nothing else, maybe it ll help 
                    give me some closure... please. 

      He pauses, looks at her, debating -- an AIDE approaches: 

                                  AIDE 
                    Sir, the Command Center s ready -- 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                          (nods; then, to Abbie) 
                    You wanna be this guy s chauffeur? 
                    Be my guest. 
 
      And off he GOES, as we PUSH IN ON ABBIE, with another agenda  
      in mind -- bridling like a horse at the starting gate -- 
 
 

      Crane sits, processing his new reality. As Abbie enters: 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Mr. Crane, I m Detective Abbie 
                    Archer. 

      He stares, tries to lift his cuffed hands, confrontational: 

                                  CRANE 
                    How do I remove these damn 
                    manacles? 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Well, you could break your thumb 
                    and try pulling your hand through, 
                    but there s about 25 cops out there 
                    who d shoot you. 

      The look between them HOLDS. He adds it up: 

                                  CRANE 
                    You want my help. Which suggests 
                    you have no options. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I m not gonna say I believe you... 
                    but I m the closest thing to it 
                    you re gonna come across. 

      He just stares at her. Into her: 

                                  CRANE 
                    I can t say I believe you either, 
                    Ms. Archer.  22. 
 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                      Detective. I haven t told you 
                    anything. 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    You ve told me everything. 
                      Everything you aren t telling your 
                      colleagues. 
 
      Abbie s eyes flick anxiously to the CCTV CAMERA. IN THE PEN 
      we find DUNN watching, concerned: what s that mean? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                          (to Crane, challenging) 
                    And what exactly would that be? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    What you already know: the killer 
                    was a headless horseman. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    That. Isn t. Possible. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Oh, really?  That s wonderful news. 
                    Thank you for the clarification -- 
                    and here I thought I d actually 
                    awoken in the future! That my wife 
                    hasn t been dead nearly two hundred 
                    and fifty years. I m glad to know 
                      everything I m hearing, seeing, and 
                    touching is impossible... because 
                    that would mean it s not actually  
                      happening. So am I free to leave? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    No: I have orders to take you to a 
                    mental institution. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                          (a beat, fuck) 
                      Excellent. This day continues to

                                  ABBIE 
                    Alright, up, time to go -- 
 
      Buttons pushed she undoes his cuffs from the STEEL LOOP on 
      the table, freeing one of his hands -- 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Hands behind your back.  23. 
 
 

      She turns him around, CINCHES his wrists back together, as: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    It can t be mere coincidence The 
                    Hessian and I arrived in this place 
                    at the same time -- you re clearly 
                    too bright to believe otherwise. 
 
      But she PUSHES him out the door -- 
 
 
 
      Abbie drives; Crane s mind races, processing his first car 
      ride: POLICE CHATTER on the radio, GPS, scenery racing by. 
      Hands cuffed, he keeps toggling the door lock button. Up. 
      Down. Abbie glances over, mildly irritated but mostly 
      fascinated by the consistency of his act. Now he tries the 
      window. Up. Down. Finally, she hits the CHILD LOCK. 
      Thwarted, he looks over. TENSION between them... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    So you were asleep for about 250 
                    years. Civil War didn t wake you? 
                    Noisy neighbors to the south? 
                          (he just stares) 
                    You get up to pee? I don t know 
                    about you, but I m gettin  up to 
                    pee every 75, 80 years, that s just 
                    me. 
 

                                  CRANE 
                          (beat, deadpan) 
                    Are you done? Or does it not 
                    concern you that most of what you 
                    say is unintelligible gibberish to 
                    me? Like watching a chicken cluck. 
                    And when did women start wearing 
                    pants? 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Hey, it s a free country thanks to 
                    you -- women wear pants, men wear 
                    dresses, it s a whole new day in 
                    America, so live it up. 
                          (beat; off his stare) 
                    You re just... not gonna break 
                      character, huh?  24. 
 
 

      He turns away. Cold shoulder. She sighs: 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Okay. Let s say I did believe you. 
                    You said you woke up in a cave? 
                    Show me. 
 
      He turns back. Eyes narrow. An OPENING here... 
 
 
 
      THE  WELCOME TO SLEEPY HOLLOW  SIGN. Abbie s cruiser pulls 
      up. Beside the sign is a SMALL DIRT ROAD leading deeper into 
      the forest. He NODS: there. As she turns off the main road, 
      Crane senses this was, in fact, her plan all along: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    You re violating orders. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    The convenient part for me is if 
                    you tell anyone, no one ll believe 
                    you. 
 
      He looks ahead, sort of SMIRKS. Sort of. She drives on: 
 
 
 
      THUD! Abbie s boots DROP DOWN into the cave. Her MAG-LIGHT 
      sweeps the walls, she hands another to Crane: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Follow my footsteps so our shoe 
                    prints don t contaminate the scene. 
 
      -- he follows as their beams move across STRANGE WALL SYMBOLS 
      FLASH! She SNAPS a picture, it DISORIENTS Crane. Abbie 
      DICTATES, approaches the MUD PIT he woke from, the jars:  26. 
 
 

                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Entering from the north end, 
                    there s a chalked white circle with 
                    a pentagram -- some kind of pit 
                    filled with clay... suggests some 
                    kinda ritual... Mendez is not gonna 
                    want to hear this... 
 
      She moves to the WALL where something catches her eye: 
 
    A STONE PANEL covered by a layer of COBWEBS. She clears the 
      webs to see the panel is actually composed of a rather 
      beautiful mosaic of RECTANGULAR STONE TILES of various sizes 
      and orientations. 
 
      Crane turns his light on Abbie, sees what she s seeing -- A 
      flash of recognition crosses Crane s face -- HE ALMOST 
      SMILES. That is until Abbie reaches out to touch the panel -- 
 
                                  CRANE 
                      Detective, NO!! 
 
      But it is too late as Abbie already has her finger on a tile 
      which slides a bit under her touch, ACTIVATING A MECHANISM 
      BEHIND THE WALL -- 
 
      -- Crane bolts toward Abbie, pulling her back as, from above, 
    a MASSIVE STONE PENDULUM SWIVELS through frame, SMASHING 
      AGAINST THE SIDE WALL where Abbie stood only a moment ago -- 
 
      -- Crane and Abbie land on the floor in a heap, Abbie falling 
      practically in Crane s lap. They watch in awe as the 
      pendulum begins to retract mechanically, back into its lethal 
      hiding place. 
 
      Crane helps Abbie back to her feet. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    How did you know that was going to 
                    happen? 
 

                                  CRANE   
                    I didn t, exactly.  
  
                      ABBIE CRANE 
      Then how did you -- -- Better than telling you, 
 why don t I show you? 
 
      Crane approaches the panel:  27. 
 
 

                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    It s a Freemason lock... But you 
                    have to move the tiles in the right 
                    order to release the key. Like a 
                    puzzle. 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                      Freemasons -- you mean like secret 
                    societies and animal sacrifices? 
 
      Crane moves the tiles, sliding them across hidden tracks 
      behind the stone, clearing the way for a SINGLE TILE SHAPED 
      DIFFERENTLY THAN THE REST to fall into Crane s hand. He then 
      pushes the irregularly shaped tile into a  KEYHOLE.  
 
      Hear LOUD SOUNDS of mechanisms turning and moving behind the 
      wall as a section of the floor DROPS DOWN MECHANICALLY 
      revealing a HIDDEN STAIRWAY! 
 
 
 
      The room is a Terry Gilliam dreamscape, ringed by SPIRAL 
      STEPS. As Abbie and Crane move through, in AWE, we see the 
       walls  are not so much walls, but rather STONE SHELVES 
      packed with dusty BOOKS, LEDGERS, SCROLLS, MAPS of all sorts. 
 
      She moves closer to the shelves, seeing each section s 
      organized by YEAR... He begins scanning books. She traces 
      the many bookcases back to the VERY FIRST SECTION, dated  33 
      B.C.  Overwhelmed: 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Some of these go all the way back 
                    before Christ, there s gotta be a 
                    hundred thousand books here... 
                          (beat) 
                    My God... what is this place? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    It s a Freemason archive. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                          (incredulous) 
                    How do you know that? How did you 
                    know how to open that lock? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Because I was one of them. I 
                    didn t tell your lie machine 
                      everything. 
 
      Crane moves as he scans the titles on the shelves.  28. 
 
 

                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    The Freemasons started as a guild 
                    of craftsmen -- masons. Builders 
                    and engineers. But it grew into 
                    something much bigger during the 
                    war -- a society of learned men who 
                    wanted to accumulate all the  
                    knowledge of the world. Including 
                    the forbidden secrets: the black 
                    arts, witchcraft, the occult... all 
                    in service of protecting the world. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Clearly not important enough to 
                    share with the world. All this has 
                    been kept secret. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Yes. Because knowledge is a 
                    powerful thing and can be misused 
                    in the wrong hands. The Masons  
                    secrets were worth protecting, even 
                    from their own. Not until achieving 
                    the highest levels of the 
                      organization, could you learn all 
                    there is to know. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    And how far did you get? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Not far enough, I m afraid. 
                    General Washington inducted me in 
                    just before the war started. But 
                    some of his most trusted men had 
                    been lifelong Masons -- men you ve 
                    probably never heard of. Benjamin 
                    Franklin, Paul Revere, John 
                    Hancock, Samuel Adams. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                          (sarcastic) 
                    Those names ring a bell. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    The General gave me specific 
                    orders: to hunt for a man with a 
                    symbol on his hand. The same man 
                    we are hunting now. I didn t know 
                    why. 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    What sort of symbol?  29. 
 
 

      And now Crane STOPS, finding what he was looking for on a 
      spine of one of the books: THE SYMBOL OF THE HORSEMAN. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                          (pulling the book) 
                    Here... This is it. 
 
      He DROPS it on a dusty table. Abbie looks up at him, WIDE- 
      EYED. 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    This is crazy. 
 
      AND WE UPCUT TO A MATCH IGNITING AN OLD OIL LAMP. The book 
      is OPENED. Crane READS, Abbie beside him, the words 
      accompanied by HAND-DRAWN ILLUSTRATIONS: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                     I watched as the Lamb opened the 
                    first of the seven seals. Then I 
                    heard one of the four living 
                    creatures say in a voice like 
                    thunder, "Come and see!"   
 
      This makes Abbie blink for reasons we ll find out shortly. 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                          (still reading) 
                     I looked, and there before me was 
                    a white horse! Its rider held a 
                    bow, and he was given a crown, and 
                    he rode out as a conqueror bent on 
                      conquest.  
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    That s  Revelations,' isn t it. 
                    The Bible. 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    ...Before I cut off his head... I 
                    shot him. A shot that would ve 
                    killed any man. But he got right 
                    back up. As though nothing had 
                    happened. 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    What are you saying? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    We may be chasing one of the Four 
                    Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 
 
      Crane and Abbie share an incredulous look, neither wanting to 
      believe what is right in front of them.  30. 
 
 

 
      SLAM TO: Knapp s CLOSING UP the church, when suddenly -- the 
      votive candles BLOW OUT. He turns, seeing something STRANGE 
      out the stained-glass... moves CLOSER for a better look... 
 
      IT S THE WHITE HORSE. Standing alone outside the church, 
      hooves clawing at the road. And in that same POV, WE GET A 
      SUDDEN AND BIG FRIGHT AS HEADLESS APPEARS RIGHT AT THE WINDOW 
      -- he needed to lure the priest close enough to  - CRASH! -- 
      stab his hand THROUGH and GRAB Knapp by his cloak! BUT THE 
      HORSEMAN S ARM IMMEDIATELY STARTS TO SMOKE, a subtle trace of 
      fire -- he s crossed the threshold into God s house. Knapp 
      BREAKS FREE as Headless retracts his SMOLDERING ARM: 
 
                                  REV. KNAPP 
                    This is God s house, Demon! You 
                    cannot enter here!!! 
 
      And suddenly The Horseman has DISAPPEARED from view. Knapp 
      hears FOOTFALLS outside -- HEAVY BOOTS moving around the side 
      of the church, COMING UP the front steps. In a shocking 
      display of force, Knapp WAVES HIS HAND and WHOOSH: a CHAIN 
      from the light fixtures on the ceiling SNAPS FREE -- spirals 
      across the room and WRAPS THROUGH THE MAIN DOOR HANDLES, 
      LOCKING THEM TIGHT. HE S A WARLOCK!!! 
 
      SILENCE... maybe that WORKED... then BOOM! THE HORSEMAN S 
      AXE SHATTERS THROUGH THE DOOR AND CHAINS AND THEY RE FLUNG 
      OPEN! Knapp, terrified but DEFIANT, SPITS his words: 
 
                                  REV. KNAPP (CONT D) 
                    I ll never tell you where it is! 
                    You will never win this war! 
 
      Headless considers, then... STRIDES RIGHT INTO THE CHURCH,  
      HIS BODY INSTANTLY IGNITING IN FLAME! Fire GROWING with each 
      bold step, but Headless doesn t give a fuck. Knapp stumbles 
      back in horror, PINNED against a column... and we GO TO: 
 
      KNAPP S POV: The burning demon SWINGS HIS AXE RIGHT AT US! 
      THUNK! IT DISAPPEARS BELOW FRAME... and then... CAMERA TILTS 
        HORIZONTALLY AND FALLS TO THE FLOOR WITH A THUD! OUR 
      DISMEMBERED POV begins to FADE as we DIE watching a pair of 
      BURNING BOOTS EXIT THE CHURCH... then, BLACK: 
 
 
 
      Abbie snaps photos of texts and drawings. Both she and Crane 
      jump when her radio blares:  32. 
 
 

                                    OFFICER DUNN (V.O.) 
                    Abbie, you got your ears on? 

      Abbie keys her walkie: 

                                  ABBIE 
                    I m here. What s up? 
 
 
 
      FLASH! A crime scene photographer snaps pictures of KNAPP S 
      CORPSE.  Abbie and Crane pull up. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I need you to wait here. 
 
    A MOMENT between them. Growing CONNECTION. She gets out. 
      He watches her go as she falls in-step with Mendez: 
 

                ABBIE (CONT D) MENDEZ 
      Sir, if I could have a word -- -- not now -- 
 

      -- because up ahead, here comes DUNN and a cadre of cops; 
      Abbie holds her tongue as they intersect to walk the scene: 
 
                                    OFFICER DUNN 
                    Looks like someone tried to make 
                    entry through the window, then came 
                    around and shattered the door -- 
 
      As they head toward the CHURCH, we go back to... CRANE IN THE 
      CAR. Looking out at ANCIENT GRAVESTONES beside the church. He 
      debates, knows he s been told to stay put, but his curiosity 
      is piqued -- stay/go/stay/go? 
 
 
 
      Mendez and co. enter: Dunn indicates a pattern of CHARRED 
      FOOTPRINTS leading from the entry to the rear exit. Abbie 
      trails behind, looks at the prints, then forensics zipping up 
      Knapp in a body bag, then the BROKEN CHAINS on the ground... 
 
                                    OFFICER DUNN 
                    Arson found burn marks in the floor 
                    in the shape of footprints, size 
                    11, the intruder scorched the tile 
                    and wood wherever he stepped. 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                    You saying the killer was on fire?  33. 
 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Excuse me... 
                          (everyone turns: the 
                            chains) 
                    ... what re those? 
 
                                    OFFICER DUNN 
                    Part of the lighting system. Looks 
                    like someone tore them down -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    That ceiling s gotta be thirty feet 
                    off the ground -- no way someone 
                    could get up there. 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                    You offering a theory, Detective? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    This wasn t random -- he came here 
                    for Knapp. 
 
      As that LANDS, Abbie doesn t realize that out the door BEHIND 
      HER... CRANE APPEARS, walking across the graveyard: 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                    I never authorized his release! 
                    What the hell is he doing here? 
 
      She turns. Ohhhhhh shit. Uh... 
 

                      ABBIE MENDEZ 
      Crane was in my custody when  
      this happened, which means You didn t answer my  
      he s not the killer -- question. 
 

      Dunn, concerned for her, gestures to the rest of the team: 
      everyone walk away. They do, leaving Abbie and Mendez: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Sir, we have three DOA s and no 
                    viable leads. Someone s on a 
                    killing spree and that man s our 
                    best chance of catching him -- 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                    That man needs a straight jacket, 
                    and you violated a direct order by 
                    bringing him here --  34. 
 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Maybe he is crazy -- or maybe, as 
                    you know, witnesses of a violent 
                    crime sometimes enter a 
                      dissociative state that breaks them 
                    from reality as an emotional 
                    response to trauma. Either way? 
                    He saw something, something that 
                    might help us -- 
 
                                  MENDEZ 
                    What re you suggesting, that we 
                    give the Founding Father a Glock 
                    and send him into the field with a 
                    pat on the back and a thumbs up? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I m suggesting he might recognize 
                    details we wouldn t even know to 
                    look for. 

      Mendez considers. Tense. It could go either way. Then: 

                                  MENDEZ 
                    Forget the asylum, just take him 
                    back to his cell immediately, or 
                    you are suspended until further 
                    notice. End of discussion. 
 
      With that, he goes, leaving her there. Dunn approaches.... 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    You re hanging yourself with this 
                    guy, Abbie, it s a big mistake. 
                    What the hell re you doing? 
 
      And she exits, leaving Dunn to watch her go, concerned... 
 
      AT AN ORNATE HEADSTONE: Crane already there, eyes fixed. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I told you to stay in the car -- 
 
                                  CRANE 
                          (without looking up) 
                    Yet as you know, I m insane, and 
                    therefore impervious to simple 
                    commands. 
 
      She follows his gaze to the NAME and INSCRIPTION... and what  
      she sees STUNS her:  Here lieth the duft of MATRON KATRINA 
      CRANE, BURNT AS A WITCH...  
 
      To himself, his head swirling...  35. 
 
 

                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    A witch...? 
 
      Abbie SWEEPS foliage off the bottom of the nameplate to 
      reveal --  ...SURVIVED BY HER BELOVED SON THOMAS CRANE.  
 
                                  ABBIE 
                     ... her son, Thomas Crane, 
                    1779...  
 
      He just stares at the name, stunned, EMOTIONAL. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    ... she was... with child... 
                          (eyes well; the first time 
                            he s said it out loud) 
                    ... Thomas... 

      FLASHCUT: Crane, dying, in the church with Katrina: 

                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    Whatever secret you wished to tell 
                    me when I returned from the 
                    front... please, tell me now... 
 
      Abbie s voice brings him back to PRESENT: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    ... Crane? Are you okay? 
 
      Crane nods stoically. Abbie watches him suffer, unsure if 
      she can console him without fully believing him. 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    C mon, we should both get a few 
                    hours of sleep. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Sleep? I ve been asleep for two 
                      centuries. A lot of good it s done 
                    me. What more do you need to 
                    believe me? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    It doesn t matter what I believe. 
                    How the hell am I supposed to 
                    explain it? I ve identified the 
                    killer, and he just happens to be 
                    the First Horseman of the 
                      Apocalypse -- trust me, it s all in 
                    this dusty book we found in a cave 
                      library...   36. 
 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    You witnessed your partner s murder 
                    with your own eyes -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Even if I thought what I saw was 
                    possible, I will be... alone. 
                    Again. Arguing a case I don t 
                      understand, based on something I 
                    thought I saw, with evidence that 
                    makes no sense -- 
 

                      CRANE ABBIE 
      -- what do you mean,  again?  (fuck, said too much) 
                                                  ... Nothing, nothing -- 
 

      She starts moving toward the car again -- he REALIZES: 
 

                      CRANE ABBIE 
      Something happened to you, (shaking her head) 
      didn t it... something that s  
      made you doubt your -- don t -- 
        perceptions. 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    We have more in common than you 
                    think: I come from a world where we 
                    took our cues by looking someone in 
                    the eye. I suspect it s what makes 
                    you a skilled investigator, but 
                    this act of controlling the 
                      unexplainable is a desperate one 
                    rooted in fear. Perhaps that s why 
                    you re leaving this place -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Hey: I don t need to be 
                      psychoanalyzed or-- whatever your 
                    version of it is -- brain leeched -- 
                    by a man who thinks that only 
                    yesterday he was fighting for 
                    George Washington in the 
                      Revolutionary War. 
 
      He s hit a NERVE. She arrives at the car, opens the door. 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    I m sorry but I need more. 
 
      And he gets in...  37. 
 
 

 
    A magnetically locked DOOR is opened, through which Crane is 
      led by a GUARD into a small, barred cell. Abbie behind him, 
    a growing sense that she doesn t want to leave him here: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                          (to the guard) 
                    Give us a minute, would you? 
                          (as the guard EXITS) 
                    I got you your own cell. It s the 
                    best I could do. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                          (looking around) 
                    Well. It s a measurable step up 
                    from a cave. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                          (beat, guilt mounting) 
                    Look... I m sorry I got mad. I 
                    don t know how to get my head 
                    around any of this. And I get that 
                    no matter what happened to you, 
                    this must all be... a scary place. 
 
      Their look HOLDS. He sits on the cot, exhales. The first 
      moment he s had to pause... and feel the weight of it all... 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Yesterday I was fighting for the 
                    freedom of a nation that didn t 
                    exist yet. I had a wife and... 
                    I didn t know she was accused of 
                    being a witch. 
                          (beat; harder) 
                    And my son... I don t know if he 
                    grew to manhood... or what he did 
                    with his life... 
 
      And for the first time, she s letting herself feel the pain 
      he s feeling. With Grey s loss, she s needing to connect. 
      Turns to go, turns back... WE SLOWLY MOVE IN ON HER... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    You asked what happened to me. 
                          (beat) 
                    Back in high school, me and my 
                    sister, Jenny... we were, uh... 
                          (beat, this is hard) 
                    Walking home one night. In the 
                    forest. And... we saw something...  38. 
 
 

      FLASHCUT: images -- in the dark forest -- TERRIFYING FLASH 
      FRAMES intercut with Abbie s story, so fast we can barely  
      decipher them -- the ground seems to be OPENING UP -- what 
      comes out is more IMPRESSIONISTIC than literal -- DEMONIC 
      FEATURES -- EYES? -- CLAWS? -- 
 
                                  ABBIE (V.O.) (CONT D) 
                    I couldn t see it clearly. It was 
                    more like... a feeling. And I 
                    heard a voice say... 
 
      We HEAR A GUTTURAL RUMBLE -- the scariest voice imaginable 
      says  COOOOMEEEE... AAAAAANNNNDDD... SEEEEEEEEEEE.....  

      BACK TO ABBIE IN THE CELL, haunted. Crane listens, rapt: 

                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Everyone said we were crazy. After 
                    awhile Jenny started believing it. 
 
      Beat. Quietly: 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    Where is she now? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    In and out of institutions. 

      He nods. Understands: 

                                  CRANE 
                    She s... battling demons. 
                          (Abbie nods) 
                    ... And you? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    It was pretty bad for awhile. Did 
                    a lot of stupid things.  Drugs. Me 
                    and this guy I was seeing end up 
                    breaking into a pharmacy. Cop car 
                    pulls up, guy bolts -- just gone -- 
                    and this sheriff steps out of the 
                      cruiser... and I m thinking: that s 
                    it, I m going to jail. My life s 
                    over. And he puts me in the car... 
                          (beat) 
                    But instead of taking me to jail... 
                    he takes me to a diner... and he 
                    orders apple pie. And says: 
 
      FLASHCUT: A piece of STEAMING APPLE PIE A-LA-MODE is set down 
      in front of SHERIFF GREY, 12 years younger, sitting across 
      from a YOUNGER, STRUNG-OUT ABBIE, at McCABE S:  39. 
 
 

                                  GREY (RIGHT TO CAMERA) 
                    You know what I love about apple 
                    pie a-la-mode? Where the hot, 
                    crispy crust comes together with 
                    the smooth, frozen ice cream. 
                          (beat) 
                    You know what I hate? Five minutes 
                    later when the ice cream melts and 
                    it s just a warm soupy mess. 
                          (readies his fork) 
                    When that happens? We re leaving. 
                    So you got five minutes to decide 
                    if you re gonna change your life... 
                    or if I m taking you to jail. 
 
      And takes a BITE of pie, savoring it. We PUSH IN ON YOUNG 
      ABBIE (SLOW MOTION), profoundly affected, as Grey eats... 
 
                                  ABBIE (V.O.) 
                    ... so I changed. Right there. 
                    Because Sheriff August Grey 
                    believed in me. I got more 
                    fathering in that five minutes than 
                    I got my whole life... 
 
      BACK TO ABBIE AT PRESENT, tears in her eyes. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    And now he s gone. 
                          (beat) 
                    But at that same moment... you 
                    came. And everyone said you were 
                    crazy. 
                          (then) 
                    And I guess I just... knew. What 
                    that feels like. 
 
      The look between them HOLDS. It takes a broken soul to 
      recognize a fellow traveler. The guard RETURNS: 
 
                                  GUARD 
                    It s lights out. 
 
      She nods, okay. Hating this. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Will I see you again, Detective? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    ... I hope so. And you can call me 
                    Abbie.  40. 
 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    I m sorry about your partner... 
                    Abbie. 
 
      An emotional look, then she goes. The lights GO OUT, bathing 
      him in moonglow from a small window. A lonely image... 
 
 
 
      Crane sleeps RESTLESSLY, eyes flutter open onto the heavenly 
      MOSAIC of the church CEILING as it comes in and out of focus. 
      Is he dreaming? Is this a memory? Something else? 
 
      Katrina enters the frame above him. There s something 
      ETHEREAL about her. She almost FLOATS. Confusion rolls 
      across Crane s face as he sees how worried his wife is... 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    It s all my fault. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    What happened? What s wrong, my 
                    love? 
 

                                    KATRINA 
                    ...The Horseman... 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    -- I thought I d killed him. I cut 
                    off his head. 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    You can t let him find it,   
                    Ichabod. If he becomes whole again 
                    it begins. 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    What begins? 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    The End... 
 
      Crane sits up, reaching for his wife... and now it s like 
      he s woken from a dream -- he finds himself alone in a 
      darkened cell. 
 

                                        END ACT THREE  41. 
 
 

                                          ACT FOUR 
 
 
 
      Abbie stares at her clock -- 2:36 AM. 
 
      IMAGES spit from a printer: the PICTURES Abbie shot. HIGH 
      AND WIDE -- the symbols FROM THE CAVE FLOOR and the ARCHIVE, 
      Abbie standing over them, trying to understand... 
 
      JUMPCUT: COMPUTER SCREEN: Abbie runs a SEARCH -- links 
      scroll:  FREEMASONS -- HISTORY OF  -- and that connects us to 
       ILLUMINATI.  DIVINATION. OCCULTISM. The IMAGES that 
      accompany that: PENTAGRAMS, THE VITRUVIAN MAN, SKULLS, and of 
      course, THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE. On Abbie, 
      TAKING COPIOUS NOTES though it s all creepy as hell... 
 
      She finally comes across several portraits and paintings of 
      GEORGE WASHINGTON -- including the famous one of him crossing 
      the Delaware... that s when it catches her eye... but it 
      can t be... she enlarges the image -- We don t know what 
      she s seeing yet as she searches, pulls up a picture of 
      Reverend Knapp from the online reports of his death and 
      overlays it on the portrait and it matches! 
 
      IT S REVEREND KNAPP CROSSING THE DELAWARE WITH WASHINGTON! 
 
 
 
      Crane s eyes SNAP OPEN with a start just as CLANG! The cell 
      door OPENS and in comes a Guard... followed by ABBIE, with 
      GRAVE URGENCY -- he sits up, disoriented -- 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    What are you... doing here? 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    I think I believe you. But I need 
                    your help first. 
 
      Off Crane as he nods, grateful... 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    What a difference a day makes. 
 
 
 
      Abbie and Crane MOVE through the colonial museum past a third 
      grade CLASS ON A FIELD TRIP. Their teacher leads them on the 
      guided tour -- 
 

                                  SCHOOL TEACHER 
                    -- and when his father asked him, 
                     George, did you chop down that 
                    cherry tree?  Washington replied, 
                     Father, I cannot tell a lie.  And 
                    he admitted to chopping down his 
                    father s tree. 
 
      Overhearing this, Crane can t contain himself as he moves 
      past them -- 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    Forgive me, ma am, but there is no 
                    credence in that... 
 
      Abbie shakes her head, as they round the corner arriving at a 
      PORTRAIT OF GEORGE WASHINGTON AND REVEREND KNAPP crossing the 
      Delaware... 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Here. Look at this one... 
 
      Crane leans in for a closer look.  43. 
 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    This is a portrait of General 
                      Washington crossing the Delaware. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    And I guess it s my turn to sound 
                    crazy. Look at the man standing 
                    next to Washington... he s in 
                    several portraits with him. I think 
                    that s Reverend Knapp -- the man 
                    The Horseman killed last night. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Because he thought that the 
                    Reverend knew where it was. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Where what was? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    His head. 
 
 ABBIE 
                    His head? 

                                  CRANE 
                    He s looking for it. And if he 
                    finds it, rumor is we may be in for 
                    some of the unpleasantness we read 
                    about. 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Where are you getting this? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    The General told me my mission was 
                    more important than the war itself. 
                    I wasn t merely ordered to fell a 
                    man in battle, I was ordered to 
                    return with his head. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                      Washington didn t want his head for 
                    bragging rights. Washington meant 
                    to keep it hidden to stop the 
                      Apocalypse. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    He must ve found quite a hiding 
                    place.  44. 
 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                          (gestures to the other 
                            paintings) 
                    C mon... 
 
      They move through the George Washington exhibit to other 
      paintings. 
 

                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                          (conviction growing) 
                    Look, there he is again, right next 
                    to Washington. 
 
      And sure enough, the next painting portrays someone who looks 
      just like Knapp next to Washington. 
 
      They continue on, finding Knapp in a handful of paintings by 
        Washington s side. 
 
      Moving past another painting, Crane stops, noticing 
      something: 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    Wait. Look here -- 
 
      ON THE PAINTING 
 
      It depicts Washington and the man who looks like Knapp 
      standing in front of a colonial house. 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    -- his right hand... 
 
      CLOSE -- In Knapp s right hand: A BIBLE WITH THE SIGN OF THE  
      HORSEMEN. 
 

                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    This is a portrait of the Elijah 
                    Miller House. The General used it 
                    as a command center during the 
                    Battle of White Plains. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Yes, but unlike you, Washington 
                    died, two centuries ago. If not the 
                    Reverend, who would he have 
                    entrusted to keep such a powerful 
                    thing safe? 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    The General would ve entrusted no 
                    one. That s the kind of secret a 
                    man like him would take to the 
                    grave.  45. 
 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Maybe he did. 
 
      This gives Abbie pause... as she notices something else in 
      the painting. 
 

                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    I ll be damned... 
 
      She reaches into her pocket and pulls the NOTEBOOK filled 
      with her notes. Flipping through: 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Did you say the  Elijah Miller 
                    House ? 
 
      Crane nods -- she finally finds the page she was looking for. 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                      Washington was buried at Mount 
                    Vernon, but his body was moved 
                    on... 
                          (reading her notes) 
                    ... October 10, 1837. 
                          (gestures: the painting) 
                    Look at the address on the porch of 
                    the house -- 
 
      CLOSE ON THE PAINTING -- Indeed it looks like an address... 
      only the numbers are  101037!  
 
                                  CRANE 
                          (nodding) 
                    Tenth day of the tenth month. That 
                    can t be a coincidence. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    His body wasn t moved to another 
                    crypt in Mt. Vernon -- 
                          (gestures to the painting) 
                    -- it was moved here. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Agreed. That was a cover. Very 
                    much how he liked to operate. He 
                    must ve left instructions for 
                    Knapp. 
 

                                  ABBIE 
                    And if you re right, what we re 
                    looking for is buried with him. 
 
      Our duo forming before our eyes --  46. 
 
 


      Abbie behind the wheel, driving FAST -- Crane shotgun -- 

                                  ABBIE 
                    I ll explain everything later, 
                    okay? If I go through Mendez, 
                    he ll ask for proof I can t give 
                    yet. The department s spread thin 
                    as it is -- 
 
      -- Dunn gets out, heads into his apartment building -- 
 

                        DUNN ABBIE 
      -- no kidding, I just worked -- I m telling you, that s 
    a 36 hour shift -- where he s going. We re 
                                                  gonna miss him -- 
 

      The sound of an ENGINE rises and we SLAM TO: 
 
 

      Dunn moving down a hall, pulling out his keys -- 

                                  DUNN 
                    -- and if you re wrong? It s on 
                    both of us. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Andy... you always trusted me. 
                    Please don t stop now. There s no 
                    time. 

    A moment of HEAVY CHOICE. Finally: 

                                  DUNN 
                    Alright, I ll call it in... I ll 
                    meet you there.  47. 
 
 
 ABBIE 
                    Thank you. 
 

      They hang up, but we STAY WITH DUNN as he reaches the door to 
      his apartment. STOPS. Because he sees... the lock s been  
      HACKED OPEN. Shit. He pulls his gun and ENTERS... 
 
 
 
      Tense. Dark. The first thing Dunn sees is a LOCKED STEEL 
      CABINET broken open, where he keeps his spare POLICE STUFF. 
      Finds a gun rack with a SHOTGUN missing. Approaches the 
      LIVING ROOM, but nobody seems to be there. He turns, gun 
      raised, about to head into the next room when, BEHIND HIM... 
 
      HEADLESS RISES UP from a high-backed chair: only now do we 
      realize HE WAS SITTING THERE ALL ALONG, the chair obscuring 
      him from view. Alert, knowing someone s behind him now, Dunn 
      slowly turns to see... 
 
      Headless has helped himself to all the modern gear: a police 
      belt and gun, and the SHOTGUN held in his hand. And we 
      assume THIS IS WHERE POOR DUNN MEETS HIS END... 

      Except that Dunn DOESN T look scared. Instead, he says: 

                                  DUNN 
                    I know where it is. 
 
    A beat: Headless swings the shotgun up and  - SHUUNCK  - 
      holsters it into his back scabbard. READY. As we realize... 
      THESE TWO ARE WORKING TOGETHER. And -- BLACK. 
 
                                        END ACT FOUR  48. 
 
 

                                          ACT FIVE 
 
 
 
      As Abbie parks... another pair of HEADLIGHTS FLASH across the 
      forest. Abbie keys her radio: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Andy, that you? 
 
                                  DUNN (V.O. OVER RADIO) 
                    It s me, Abbie. Backup s on its 
                    way, but my damn car s stuck and I 
                    jacked my arm pretty bad trying to 
                    move it. You got a med kit? 
 
      She looks out at the misty grounds. Not ideal. 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    ... okay, stand by. 
                            (unbuckles belt, to Crane) 
                    Stay here, and I mean it this time. 
                    In about three minutes an armed 
                    SWAT team s gonna be swarming this 
                    place looking for something to 
                    shoot, you re my responsibility -- 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    -- you re going out there with a 
                    Headless Horseman on the prowl and 
                    I m the disturbed one? I m coming. 

      She looks at him. Sighs, indicates the GLOVE COMPARTMENT: 

                                  ABBIE 
                    Alright. There s a gun in that 
                      compartment. You ll need it. 
 
      He reaches out to open the glove box, but it s LOCKED. In 
      that instant, she SNAPS A CUFF onto his wrist -- before he 
      can REACT, she SNAPS the other end to the steering wheel -- 
 
                                  ABBIE (CONT D) 
                    Sorry. I need you in one piece. 
 
      As she gets out, he STRUGGLES against the cuffs, FURIOUS:  49. 
 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    This is-- unacceptable! 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    We can talk about it later. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Release me! 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                          (tosses a WALKIE on the 
                            seat) 
                    Press the button here to talk if 
                    you need me. 
 
      She CLOSES the door. Pops the trunk, grabs a med-kit and a 
      SHOTGUN. He STRUGGLES with his cuffs as he watches her walk 
      off, disappearing into the FOG... 
 
 
 
      Crane sits in the cruiser, weighing something in his mind. 
      Finally grabs the walkie: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Abbie! -- 
 
 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    ... Abbie? 
 
      No response. Crane knows something is way off -- starts 
      struggling with his cuffs, trying to get out... REMEMBERING 
      something she said. Last resort: he takes hold of his thumb 
      and, one, two, CRACKS IT BACK, BREAKING IT AT THE BASE -- 
      WINCES IN AGONY -- starts to slip his hand through the cuffs - 
    - UNBEARABLE -- finally manages to PULL HIS HAND FREE, 
      leaving the cuffs dangling from the steering wheel -- BOLTS 
      out the door: 
 
 
 
      Crane enters, alert, adrenaline spiking. Weathered, greying 
      furniture. The interior from a forgotten 18th century era. 
 
                                    WOMAN S VOICE 
                      Ichabod...  
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Abbie? Where are you? 
 
      But it s Crane s WIFE who STANDS THERE -- she s clearly not a 
      dream or an illusion. Impossibly, she is right in front of 
      him. Crane s heart SOARS: 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                      ...Katrina... are you really here? 
 
      Katrina shakes her head, wishing it were so... 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    No, my love... not in the way I 
                    would wish. Only my spirit remains 
                    now. But it won t remain much 
                    longer. 
 
      Her slightly unearthly voice is nearly all that gives it 
      away. Crane realizes he s talking to an APPARITION, and 
      despite a moment of hope, they will never be together again. 
      Crane s heart breaks. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    But why was my life spared through 
                    time and not yours? 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    When you beheaded The Horseman, 
                    your blood merged on the 
                      battlefield, binding you together.  51. 
 
 

      FLASH: Our opening battle, CRANE S WOUNDED BODY lies beside 
      the HEADLESS HESSIAN, their POOLS OF BLOOD merging... 
 
                                    KATRINA (V.O.) (CONT D) 
                    His blood is the only thing that 
                    saved you from death. And it was 
                    also his undoing... 
 
      She moves to him. Faces close. Her heart in her eyes... 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT D) 
                    The Masons asked my coven s help to 
                    put a spell on you... to keep you 
                    between life and death... 
 
      AND NOW HERE S WHERE ALL OF CRANE S MEMORIES ADD UP: 
 

      FLASH: In the church, Katrina puts her hand ON HIS WOUND -- 
      he GASPS and now we see what comes next: she WHISPERS STRANGE 
      WICCAN LANGUAGE -- 
 

                                    KATRINA (CONT D) 
                    Knowing the spell would also keep 
                    The Horseman from riding again for 
                    as long as you were asleep. 
 
      FLASH: In the cave, Crane s lowered into the mud, surrounded 
      by the chanting hooded figures... as Crane DISAPPEARS, one of 
      the hooded figures looks up -- KATRINA. A tear leaks. And 
      we MATCH off her young face to -- 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT D) 
                    They buried his body in a watery 
                    grave... 
 
      FLASH: DAY: on a cobblestone bridge, A CASKET is pushed off 
      the back of a WAGON, CRASHING and SINKING into the Hudson: 

      PRESENT: KATRINA S FACE, as he finally understands: 

                                  CRANE 
                    You put me in that cave. 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    Acting on General Washington s 
                    orders. He took possession of The 
                      Horseman s head and hid it here... 
 
      She gestures, wracked with TERRIBLE GUILT...  52. 
 
 

 
      POV, BLURRY, UPSIDE DOWN -- Abbie coming back to 
      consciousness as she s being CARRIED somewhere by DUNN... 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    ... And--dy.... What re you... 
 
      THUD! She s dropped in his TRUNK -- HARD. Tries to move but 
      she s too weak. He looks down at her, quietly demented: 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    I tried to get you to leave, I 
                    triiied, but YOU. DIDN T.  LISTEN. 
                    You just... had to be you.  Don t 
                    you understand what s about to 
                    happen here? What s coming? 
 
      And now we begin to CROSSCUT: 
 
      ON CRANE, the puzzle taking shape: 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    I searched the world for a way to 
                    sever your bloodlines... so I could 
                    wake you, without awakening him... 
                    but I failed. 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Then you didn t bring me back? 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    It s The Horseman who was 
                      resurrected... 
 
      FLASH: NIGHT: against the full moon, HEADLESS suddenly  
      explodes from beneath the water s surface: 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT'D) 
                    ...and you along with him. 
 
      ON KATRINA. Real fear: 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT D) 
                    Even if you defeat The Horseman 
                    tonight, this is only the 
                      beginning... 

      CUT TO DUNN, looking down at Abbie in the trunk: 

                                  DUNN 
                      Come and see.  And I looked, and 
                    behold a pale horse: and his name 
                    that sat on it was Death...   53. 
 
 

      ON ABBIE, hearing the words  Come And See.  Her worst fears: 
 
                                  DUNN (CONT D) 
                    That s why I always believed you -- 
                    I heard the voice too. We were 
                    chosen to be its servants, Abbie -- 
                    to prepare the way. A war is  
                    coming... 
 
      CUT BACK TO KATRINA AND CRANE: 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    I m sorry, Ichabod... but you ve 
                    traded one war for another. Except 
                    this time, its soldiers are hidden 
                    among the faces of this town. 
                    Knapp isn t the only soldier in 
                    this war who remains from long ago. 
                    There are many on the other side. 
                    Sleepy Hollow takes its name from 
                    the hallowed ground on which it 
                    lies, a long-dormant sanctum of 
                    good and evil... and it s been 
                    rudely awakened. 
 
      BACK TO DUNN, as the CRY OF AN INCOMING HORSE echoes through 
      the forest. He grins: 
 
                                  DUNN 
                    Once he s whole again, he ll join 
                    the others. There ll be no turning 
                    back -- events will unfold that 
                    none of you can stop... 
 
      He reaches up and SHUTS her in the trunk, but... CLACK: 
      oddly, it doesn't close all the way. Lifts the trunk to see 
      what's blocking it: A TIRE IRON held upright by Abbie! She 
      CLOBBERS him in the head, his GUN falling free. Dazed, she 
      tumbles out, blood covering her ear and neck. Dunn on the 
      ground, barely stirring. She swipes his gun and cuffs, makes 
      her way to the driver door... weak, dizzy... grabs the RADIO: 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    Metro, Officer needs help, request 
                    SWAT team and air support, 140 
                    Virginia Road... use extreme  
                      caution... 
 
      BACK TO KATRINA AND CRANE: 
 
      ON CRANE, taking in the weight of that -- the mantle of epic 
      responsibility --  54. 
 
 

                                  CRANE 
                    And what of our family? What 
                    happened to Thomas? What happened 
                    to our son?! 
 
      Her eyes WELL. This may be the very worst part of all... 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                      Ichabod... I think our son is the  
                    one who resurrected The Horseman. 
 
      Before we can understand what that MEANS, the POUNDING HOOVES 
      BUILDING -- Katrina TURNS -- 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT D) 
                    He s here. 
 
 CRANE 
                    Abbie... 
 
 

 
    A WAVE OF KATRINA S HAND and BOOM BOOM! All the SHUTTERS 
      SLAM SHUT around them like a domino horror show. A LARGE 
      CABINET SCRAPES across to BLOCK THE DOOR! 
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    We must hurry. 
 
      Another targeted gesture of her hand and a HEAVY TRUNK on the 
      floor SLIDES AWAY, followed by FLOORBOARDS that now RIP OPEN, 
      controlled by her will.  55. 
 
 

      And there, below the house s foundation, lies a SHALLOW GRAVE  
      with a single STONE COFFIN. And etched upon it: 
 
       HERE LIES GEORGE WASHINGTON, THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THESE 
      UNITED STATES.  
 
      He marvels at her power, but only now realizes the toll that 
      using it is taking upon her. A nearly imperceptible ripple 
      through her specter, as a paleness overcomes her: 
 
                                    KATRINA (CONT D) 
                    It s up to you now. I must go-- 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    NO!!  
 
                                    KATRINA 
                    SUNRISE WILL DESTROY HIM! HE LL 
                    TRY TO RETURN TO THE WATER BEFORE 
                    DAYBREAK, HE CAN T HIDE FROM IT! 
                          (then, desperate) 
                    Please... keep it safe, My Love... 
                    I m sorry... 
 
      And she VANISHES INTO THIN AIR... 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    KATRINA!! 
 
      The house begins to shudder from the force of The Horseman 
      trying to unblock the entrance. Crane knows he has to keep 
      going, turns toward the marble coffin and THROWS HIS FULL 
      WEIGHT INTO PUSHING THE HEAVY STONE LID OFF -- 
 
      KABOOM! -- A SHOTGUN BLAST rips open a large hole in the 
      BLOCKED DOOR. THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN HAS ARRIVED. 
 
 
 
      Crane manages to push the lid off, dust swirling, lightly 
      obscuring what s inside:  56. 
 
 

      GEORGE WASHINGTON S BODY, in his MILITARY UNIFORM, hands in 
      repose on his chest, and resting on top of them: 
 
      THE HORSEMAN S SKULL! 
 
      Torn, Crane sees DAWN BREAK between the shutters as -- BOOM! 
      The cabinet CRASHES OVER, revealing HEADLESS -- Crane spots 
      an AXE next to the wood-stacked fireplace. SWIPES the OIL 
      LANTERN -- HURLS it at the door and it EXPLODES! Buying him 
      time to GRAB the axe as Headless enters the room with the 
      shotgun and -- CLANG! Crane s axe clashes with the shotgun 
      barrel as it FIRES WILDLY... SKULL falling at their feet as 
      the enemies begin a REMATCH. 
 
 
 
      The CHOPPER SEARCHLIGHT bleeds through the window shutters, 
        backlighting the VICIOUS FIGHT as Crane PUSHES Headless into 
      the wall, dropping him in a heap and sending the shotgun 
      skidding across the floor. Headless, ADVANCES toward the 
      shotgun, cocks it expertly, and FIRES, just missing Crane as 
      he SWOOPS out the door DISAPPEARING into the OPEN GROUNDS, 
      skull in hand. 
 
 
 
      Windows SHATTER, shutters SPLINTER OPEN, walls ERUPT -- 
      Headless is peppered with bullets, but only mildly deterred 
      as he recovers his shotgun, takes aim, FIRING back: 
 
      Police take cover behind vehicles -- metal and glass explode! 
      Headless RELOADS from his AMMO BELT when a back door BANGS 
      OPEN -- three SWAT TROOPS OPEN UP, shredding Headless  back -- 
 
      Headless turns. Irritated. Then, WHOOSH, he FLIPS the shotgun 
      like a BAT and comes at them SWINGING. Hard. Brutal. Quickly 
      dispatching the three troops. Looks at their fallen machine 
      rifles. Picks one up. LIKES it. 

      Picks up the OTHER ONE. Two-fisting them. When suddenly -- 

      His arm begins to SMOKE. A faint hint of SUNLIGHT has found 
      him. He WHIRLS, SEES two things outside: DAWN! And: CRANE has  
      the skull. Headless holds a  look  on Crane, debating between 
      him and the horizon s glow... fuck! Turns and RACES out the 
      back, using the twin auto rifles to CUT A SWATH through 
      police -- his HORSE arrives and he MOUNTS UP: 
 
 
 
    A last glimpse of Headless as he disappears below the 
      surface... Crane HITS the dash, ENRAGED -- leaps out: 
 
                                  CRANE 
                    Open the rear hatch -- 
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    The trunk?  
 
                                  CRANE 
                    YES, the trunk! 
 
      HARD CUT TO: THUNK! Abbie POPS it, Crane digs urgently 
      through gear for NYLON ROPE. Hands one end to Abbie -- 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    Tie this -- 
                          (her BUMPER HITCH) 
                    -- to that. 
 
      Before she can ask a question, SPLASH: he DIVES into the 
      Hudson, the rope coiling out behind him. GONE. Stunned, 
      Abbie quickly realizes his play here -- she TIES her end to 
      the hitch -- hops in, THROWS the gear in REVERSE, engine 
      REVVING -- turns and looks back: 
 
      PUSH IN ON THE WATER... nothing... Abbie s WORRIED, this is  
      taking TOO LONG... then: PUUUUHHHH! Crane SURFACES shouting: 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                      NOW!!!!!!!! 
 
      She PINS the pedal and the cruiser SURGES BACKWARD, the rope 
      goes TAUT -- wheels CHURN in the mud but win the fight... and 
      we now SEE what's tied to the other end as AN ANCIENT COFFIN 
      drags out of the lake! 
 
      Abbie stops the car, flies out, joining Crane as he rushes 
      from the water and TEARS open the coffin to reveal... 
      HEADLESS CONVULSING INSIDE AS HE S HIT BY FULL SUN! Tries to 
      LEAP OUT, his body SMOKING MADLY, but Crane SLAMS him back 
      down, PINNING him until... HEADLESS GOES UP IN FLAMES! Crane 
      recoils as The Horseman BURNS and MELTS into a blackened 
      SKELETON before finally giving up in a death rictus... 
 
      And it all ENDS. Abbie and Crane COLLAPSE, exhausted. Out 
      of breath. They MEET EYES, having just run this impossible 
      gauntlet together. Despite it all, he manages a weak smile: 
 
                                  CRANE (CONT D) 
                    Did you see the look on his face? 
                    I think we surprised him.  59. 
 
  

      And Abbie GRINS...  
 
                                  ABBIE 
                    We re gonna have to have a real 
                    long talk about staying in the car. 
 
      As POLICE VEHICLES rush in behind them, we RISE UP above the 
      scene... over which, MENDEZ S VOICE: 
 
                                  MENDEZ (V.O.) 
                    I went over the report you filed 
                    after Grey s death. To say there 
                    are egregious gaps would be an 
                      understatement...
