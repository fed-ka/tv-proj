      The motif is wanted posters wallpaper, lines of retired 
      police badges cover the bar, saw dust floors, pools of 
      light, stuffed with boisterous off-duty cops who 
        occasionally lower their voices, whisper, glance towards:

      Sikes, who has violated unwritten protocol by bringing a 
      Newcomer to the place, sitting in a booth at the far end of 
      the bar giving them a commanding view of the place as:      WAITRESS, dressed in a Frederick's version of a cop 
      uniform, places a single drink in front of Sikes and one 
      dozen in front of George who proceeds to down the drinks in 
      gulps to Sikes' horror.

                                  SIKES
                    Okay, that's it, I'm the designated driver 
                    for the 90's.

      Sikes sips his drink, stares down to George's dozen.

                                  GEORGE
                    When you drink it acts as a depressant, 
                    your senses blur, a comfortable buzz sets 
                    in. When we drink it sharpens our senses, 
                    we become intensely focused, subjectivity 
                    fades and a state approaching our vaunted 
                      objectivity is attained ...

      Sikes sits back, shakes his head, amused.

                                  GEORGE
                            (continued)
                    Did I make an inadvertent joke? Did I make 
                    a pun? Explain.

                                  SIKES
                    No, George, you're right on the money. It's 
                    just that when we go through hell it's 
                    nice, customary even, for a friend to offer 
                    his advice over a meal, a drink, whatever, 
                    but it's all redundant here after two pops 
                    you become Sigmund Freud and I wind up a 
                    basket case.

      George understands, Sikes takes up his own beer.

                                  GEORGE
                      I understand, but it goes without saying I 
                    value your opinion, Matt.

                    by the skin of my teeth.

      George downs #5, slides the empty glass aside, agrees. 
      Sikes' attention is slowly divided between their 
        conversation and the bar and will be increasingly drawn to 
      the bar.

                                  GEORGE
                    Buck is my son, my responsibility, I accept

                    To be a successful detective, or a success 
                    in any field for that matter, you give one

                    Sikes' attention has turned slightly 
                    towards the bar and:

                    see.

      George turns to the Rookie cop, gives her a scrutinizing 
      glance.

                                  GEORGE
                    I see a sexually aggressive 38D-26-35, who 
                    has more than a passing interest in your 
                    presence and your physique.

                                  GEORGE
                    Smile back. Discreetly, yet directly. If 
                    she wishes a more intimate contact she will 
                    take this as an invitation, if she does 
                    not, she will turn away.

      Sikes turns and deliberately gives a very hammy and slow 
      smile.

                                  SIKES
                            (grinning)
                    I feel like one of those jerks who writes 
                    letters to girlie magazine editors.

      Sikes covers his face, thusly mortified, as a BIG MAN COP 
      behind the rookie thought Sikes was smiling at him.

      Sikes looks up to the perfect Vargas-girl in rookie 
      uniform, name is CHERYL KANE.

                                  CHERYL
                    I'm Cheryl Kane. Newly assigned to your 
                    precinct. Detective Sikes may I presume...

      Cheryl hardly pays any attention to George who dons his 
      jacket as there is heat radiation passing between Sikes and 
      Cheryl.                                  GEORGE
                    You're on your own. See you in the morning, 
                    Matt.

      Cheryl barely acknowledges George, slides into the booth 
      across from Sikes, all systems go.

                                  CHERYL
                    I've been hoping we could get together, say 
                    maybe over dinner tomorrow night. We could 
                    discuss police procedures.

      Cheryl's hands are under the table, Sikes jumps, clears his 
      throat, looks around to see if anyone saw.

                                  SIKES
                    What could I tell you about procedures? At 
                    this rate you'll make commissioner your 
                    first year ...

      Cheryl smiles, rises, returns to the bar on legs that don't 
      quit.


      As George hangs up his coat, starts towards Buck's room, 
      from which come the sounds of a Newcomer instrument at 
      somewhat LOUD TONES, making George wince, the familiar 
      clicking sounds of George's native tongue make him turn to 
      see:

                                  MOODRI
                            (voice)
                      Restraint, George.                                  GEORGE
                      Restraint?

      Moodri stands at the door of his humidity controlled room, 
      nods sagely.

                                  MOODRI
                      Restraint. Communication. Compassion.

                                  GEORGE
                            (calm)
                    Restraint ... Communication... 
                      Compassion ...

      Moodri smiles, winks at George, who enters.


      where in the moonlight, framed in his window, Buck sits 
      strumming his Newcomer instrument which trills an almost 
      HYPNOTIC MELODIC CHORD, as George enters, sits on the bed 
      across from Buck, a beat...

        (SUBTITLED):

                                  GEORGE
                    You have the gift. Your mother's side of 
                    the family could be great musicians if they 
                    wanted..

      Buck continues to play.

                                  BUCK
                    You speak in tongue?

                                  GEORGE
                    Whatever the tongue, the message is the 
                    same.

                                  BUCK
                    Message?

      George pauses, this does not come easy.                                  GEORGE
                    I'm sorry. I'll try to be a better Dad to 
                    you from here on. Forgive me?

      George raises an open palm-towards Buck who continues to 
      strum. George gives up, starts to rise, when suddenly Buck 
      seizes his hand.

                                  BUCK
                    I let you down. I'll try harder to be a 
                    better son. I'll make you proud of me, 
                    you'll see.

                                  GEORGE
                    I am proud of you, Buck.

                                  BUCK
                    I'm sorry, Dad.

      A tear slides down George's cheek and he quickly wipes it, 
      as if embarrassed.

                                  BUCK
                            (continued)
                    Moodri says; tears are signs of strength 
                    not weakness.

      Father and son embrace.


      As Sikes comes up the steps, arms laden with mail, 
      groceries, newspapers, dry cleaning, singles life detritus, 
      dropping some, picking it up, dropping it again as:

      CATHY comes out, dressed to the nines, sees Sikes 
      predicament as he fumbles with the outer door lock.

                                  CATHY

                    I've just about got it...

      BONK!

      A half gallon container of milk falls on Sikes' foot, 
      causing him to drop everything, he winces.      Cathy and Sikes gather groceries, kneeling together on the 
      floor.

                      epidemiology. The study of epidemics.

      Cathy, close to Sikes, quietly reaches forward to brush an 
      eyelash off Sikes' cheek, but Sikes flinches as if she took 
      a swing at him, causing him to recoil, to see his revulsion 
      which he feels very unforgettable about, a beat of this 
      passes silently between them.

                                  CATHY
                    There was a lash on your cheek.

      Cathy is noble, manages a smile, but is attuned to the 
      bottom line.

                                  CATHY
                    Night, Mr. Sikes.

      Sikes is left alone in the hallway, feeling like a boor, 
      arms filled with junk which he now lets fall, pulls a beer 
      from the pile.


      SUSAN'S ARM

      has broken out in large red scabs, as she sits at her 
      dressing table studying her arm, rubbing cortisone cream 
      onto the lesion, in the mirror we see George enter, blowing 
      his nose, sniffling, wiping his eyes.                                  SUSAN
                    I have more lesions. I'm afraid the

                    I nearly killed myself on a skate coming

                    court. They probably stopped off for a junk 
                    food attack.

                                  GEORGE
                    At least one of the Francisco's knows how 
                    to make friends.

      Susan hears the tone in George's voice, comes over to him, 
      sits down, begins rubbing his back, HUMMING, kisses him 
      until George begins to hum and ...

      RING! RING!                                  GEORGE
                    Time out, George.

      Susan playfully bites George's ear.

                                  SUSAN
                    It must be Emily.


      Susan opens the door as George comes down the stairs to 
      find Brenda there, frantic.

                                  BRENDA
                    Is Emily with you?!

      The shift assembles, hushed voices, as the CAPTAIN GRAZER 
      enters with George. The room falls silent.

                    about abduction, kidnapping or worse, the 
                    first hours are crucial.

      Francisco and Sikes rushes in as the briefing breaks up, 
      goes to George.

                                  GRAZER
                            (continued)
                    - Sikes will help you any way they can.

                                  SIKES
                          (a whisper)
                    Emily probably just wandered off.

                                  GEORGE
                            (doubtful)
                    Emily is logical objective, and highly 
                      intelligent. She wouldn't just "wander off" 
                    like that.

                                  SIKES
                    Either way you've got the whole force 
                    behind you. We'll find her. We will.

                                  GRAZER
                          (to the room)
                      Questions?

      Silence; Sikes pats George on the shoulder as the briefing 
      ends and they exit.


      as Sikes and George enter to a wave of patrolmen LAUGHTER.

                                  COP'S VOICES (OS)
                    As I see it; scratch one baby Slag. 
                    Somebody did a public service.

      Sikes touches George's shoulder to say "easy".

                                  GEORGE
                    It's okay. I'm chilled.

      As they round a locker to see a huge cop named KOWALSKI 
      who's holding forth with about ten other cops all of whom       grow silent, turn away at George's appearance. Not so with 
      Kowalski, who lights a cigar, eyes George, who steps to his 
      locker which is near Kowalski's. George pauses, points 
      under the bench.

                                  GEORGE
                    Is that little thing under there yours, 
                    Kowalski?

      Kowalski tries to see under the bench where George points.

                                  KOWALSKI
                    I don't see nothing. What is it?

      POW!

                                  GEORGE
                    Your brain, waxjob.

      George knees Kowalski in the face so hard the giant goes 
      rocketing back into a wall of lockers, crushes them, 
      charges back, night stick out. George deftly sidesteps, 
      winds up like a fastball pitcher, twists the stick from 
      Kowalski's hand, swings like a driving iron into Kowalski's 
      crotch, as two other cops try to restrain him and he hurls 
      them aside like paper dolls. Kowalski pulls his revolver

      Sikes dives for it.

                                  SIKES
                    No. No. No!

      George is tackled down by six cops who can barely restrain 
      him as Kowalski has Sikes in the air, about to hurl him 
      into a row of lockers.

      WHISTLE SOUNDS!

      All fighters turn, stop, look at the doorway where a 
      SERGEANT DOBBS stands, disgusted, shaking his head at the 
      tangle of bodies, the destroyed locker room.

                                  SERGEANT DOBBS
                      Francisco, report to the Captain!                                  SIKES
                    What?! It wasn't his -

                                  SERGEANT DOBBS
                    Did I rap on your cage, Sikes!?
                          (to all)
                    L.A.'s finest. The question is; finest 
                    what?

      George exits.


      as George and Sikes enter, met at the door by Susan, who 
      sees George's bloody hand.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm okay. Any word?

                                  SUSAN
                    No. Nothing yet.
                    PHONE RINGS! Once...twice a beat here.

      Buck I bounds down the stairs, I airs, grabs the phone 
      before Sikes can get it.                                  BUCK
                    Hello? ...

                                    WOMAN'S VOICE
                            (phone)
                    Check your mailbox, Slag. Special delivery.

      Sikes hears this, stops Buck from rushing to the mailbox.

                                  SIKES
                    I'll go.

      Sikes turns to George.

                                  SIKES
                            (continued)
                    Keep them inside.

      George nods, Sikes exits.


      Nicotine and Parker, who talk in staccato rhythms, lug 
      their cases along the hallway, escorted by Buck.

                                  NICOTINE
                    Nice place.

                                  PARKER
                    Loud colors.

      Buck opens the door to Emily's room.

                                  NICOTINE
                    Thanks.

                                  PARKER
                    We'll call you.

      Parker closes the door.


      Dark, scary. Moonlight shines through an open window.

                                  NICOTINE
                    It's dark...

      CLICK! Parker hits a light switch.

                                  PARKER
                    It's light.

      The room is in shambles, furniture broken, wallpaper flaked 
      off the wall, bed clothes and toys in shreds, formed into 
      what seems like a huge hornet's nest suspended from the 
      ceiling to the floor, as if spun from threads.                                  NICOTINE
                    A nest?

                                  PARKER
                    For who? Big Bird?

      CHEEP! A sound is heard, cricket-like.

                                  NICOTINE
                    A noise.

                                  PARKER
                      Definitely not a bird noise.

      The debris and the junk is furrowed as something RUSTLES 
      through. Nicotine and Parker advance, pull their guns until

      CHEEP! grows louder, more emphatic, and suddenly debris 
      explodes upward as Nicotine SCREAMS, something has shot up 
      his trouser leg. He SCREAMS, fights, falls over backwards. 
      Parker covers with his gun, unable to help, until Nicotine 
      rips off his pants to reveal a small, furry creature on 
      Nicotine's thigh, SQUEAKING, biting. Parker is kneeling 
      with his gun on the creature that suddenly jumps on him. 
      Parker now SCREAMS, falls over backwards as Nicotine grabs 
      the pistol, cocks it.

      BANG! The door whips open.

                                  BUCK
                    Beedoes! NO!

      The creature relents. Nicotine and Parker look as the 
      creature scrambles across the room into Buck's hand.

                                  NICOTINE
                    I don't want to know...

                                  PARKER
                    A hamster from hell ...

                                  BUCK
                    Emily's pet.                                  NICOTINE
                    "Emily's pet." I'd settle for a serial 
                    killer just now.

      Buck places the creature in a small cage and watches as the 
      creature proceeds to bump and throw itself into the metal 
      bars in one corner.


      Kitchen Clock:

      shows 11:00, continues to TICK LOUDLY as-

      George sits quietly at the table, staring. Susan scratches 
      her arm where it shows splotches, studies George a beat as 
      tears stream down George's face. (SUBTITLES)

                                  SUSAN
                    What's wrong?

                                  GEORGE
                    It's not right for you to see me like this.

                                  SUSAN
                    We've seen each other in worse moments. 
                    Aboard the ship?

                                  GEORGE
                    No, even the ship was not this bad.

      Susan SIGHS, concedes, the bond is strong.

                                  SUSAN
                    You'll find her. I believe in you. We all 
                    do.

                                  GEORGE
                    No. Not me. Grazer took me off the case.

                                  SUSAN
                    He can't do that.

                                  GEORGE
                    He can and did. He says I'm too close to 
                    the case.                                  SUSAN
                    Being too close to the case means you'll go 
                    all out...

                                  GEORGE
                    Not to them.

      Susan reaches out, touches George's hand which he kisses 
      and notices the red blotches on it.

      KNOCK. KNOCK

      comes at the kitchen door, which Susan opens to find Brenda 
      is there, holding a pan of brownies. George looks away as 
      Brenda stammers, sorry, awkward, powerless.

                                  BRENDA
                    I'm sorry to barge in like this. I just 
                    wanted to say how I never in a million 
                    years thought ...
                            (trails off)
                    Words sound so silly at times like 
                    these ... I told the police all I know. I 
                    baked you some brownies.

      George rises, pushes past Susan, says nothing to Brenda, 
      who hands Susan the brownies, leaves as Moodri comes into 
      the room, looks at Susan.

                                  MOODRI
                    You'd think she'd know we don't eat 
                    brownies. Bluch...

      Susan sits, Moodri touches her shoulder.

                                  MOODRI
                            (continued)
                      Strength...

      Susan sighs.

                                  SUSAN
                    Strength.


      as George enters a dark circular room: tatami mats, coved 
      circular ceiling, mist. He nods greetings to the other 
      Newcomers, removes his shoes, lies on his back in a circle 
      of Newcomers. He joins hands, closes his eyes, the entry 
      door slides shut plunging them into darkness. They start to 
      hum (filter treated) as from the coved ceiling there 
      appears:

      A pin prick of blue God light, which widens into a star 
      sized beam of light which widens to a beam of close 
      encounters light. The tight circle of Newcomers rises to 
      kneeling position, breaks off, each participant turns to a 
      partner in couples. George opens his eyes to find himself 
        face-to-face with:

      MOODRI

      whose wide eyes also reflect surprise at seeing George. 
      They speak in Newcomer tongue with SUBTITLES.                                  MOODRI
                    How long has it been since you came to a 
                    retreat?

                                  GEORGE
                    About as long as it's been since I walked 
                    on salt water.

                                  MOODRI
                    What brings you now?

      George pulls the revolver from his windbreaker. Moodri 
      looks at it, then into George's eyes.

                                  MOODRI
                    Please communicate regarding this ...

                                  GEORGE
                    I am torn between two worlds. That which we 
                    left which you told me had culture and 
                    great vision and that of violence and 
                    hostility where I find myself ... wanting 
                    to kill

                                  MOODRI
                    You were not born when I left First World. 
                    There we were treated as slaves, beneath 
                    contempt, beasts of burdens, items of 
                      convenience.

                                  GEORGE
                    And what do we have here?

                                  MOODRI
                      ...Freedom.

                                  GEORGE
                    To do their biding, play their games, feign 
                      tolerance. It's a strange species.

                                  MOODRI
                    Define strange?

      The blue light from above beams wider.                                  GEORGE
                    I find them vicious, vindictive, petty 
                    and ...
                            (pauses)

                                  MOODRI
                            (senses more)
                    "And yet?"

                                  GEORGE
                    - and yet, at the same time, they are 
                    capable of great art, compassion, 
                      sacrifice, even nobility, love.

                                  MOODRI
                    The next millennium will be a trial for 
                    this world, as the next nineteen hours will 
                    be for you.

                                  GEORGE
                      Officially I was removed so my training, my 
                      expertise, can't be used to save my own 
                    child. I can't entrust her life to them.

                                  MOODRI
                    No, you prefer to rely on this

      Moodri glances down at the gun.

                                  GEORGE
                    I have my limits.

      The light beam turns hot-white, widens, begins to close.

                                  MOODRI
                    If you wish to find Emily. You have 
                    something far stronger at your disposal. 
                    Something she reminded us of in the 
                    tape ...

      George is confused.

                                  GEORGE
                    Be clear.                                  MOODRI
                          (a whisper)
                    Beedoes.

      George is skeptical, the white light reverts to blue, and 
      narrows, plunging them into:

                                  GEORGE
                            (skeptical)
                    Her pet?

      DARKNESS ...


      as George bursts into the room, startling Nicotine and 
      Parker who are working.

                                  GEORGE
                    Beedoes!

                                  PARKER
                    The little monster? Over there Only keep it 
                    away from us, George.

      George goes over to Beedoes' cage, sits down and CHEEP! 
      CHEEP!

      Susan and Buck enter, concerned, study the cage a beat.

                                  BUCK
                    It's like he's trying to break out.

      George reaches into the cage, picks up the furry, little 
      creature, studying it.

                                  GEORGE
                    Beedoes? What do you say we find Emily 
                    together? Team up?

      Beedoes bites George.

                                  GEORGE
                    Ow! He bit me! This is ridiculous!

      George sucks his thumb, angry, as a CUCKOO CLOCK SOUNDS ...

      A twisted VFW hall, huge Purist banners hang from ceiling, 
      to Death to Newcomers", "Purify the Race" slogans adorn the 
      walls.

      Purists, many dressed similar to skinheads, almost para- 
      military, are drinking beer at card tables, playing darts, 
      using painted Newcomer faces for targets as:

      Sikes walks through this tableau, over to a bar where a 
      LADY BARTENDER wearing a t-shirt that says, "Welcome to 
      Earth, Now Go Home", comes over, gives him the up and down.

      Sikes places his badge on the bar.

                    ...Your mother.

      Bartender presses a button on the bar and an air-raid SIREN 
      SOUNDS, music stops, conversation halts, all eyes turn 
      towards Sikes who holds up his badge.

      Guns, knives, clubs, mace, chains, all fall from the 
      pockets of the Purists wishing not to be caught with 
      concealed weapons.

      A big Purist drops a snubbed-nosed .32. Sikes grabs the man 
      by the neck, pushes him down onto the floor.

      Sikes does a dive, roll, comes into a combat firing kneel 
      right in the Purist's face, gun aimed.

      Purist, sweating, gun in his mouth. Other Purists don't 
      move, their women glare at Sikes as he passes, pulling down 
      the banners.

      Purist suddenly takes a sucker punch at Sikes who ducks, 
      kick boxes his attacker in one smooth move, out cold onto a

      Purists GROAN...


      where Susan is in the passenger seat and Buck sits in the 
      back seat with a lap top computer. George switches off his 
      walkie-talkie, depressed.

                    Five A.M. and Sikes is pulling in every

                    Come on, Fuzzy.

      Susan takes Beedoes' cage from the back seat, CHEEP!

                          (a sigh)
                    I still maintain, using Beedoes to find 
                    Emily is ridiculous.

                                  SUSAN
                    Then why did Emily mention him? And if 
                    Moodri said Beedoes is attuned Emily, I 
                    believe him. You're just mad cause Beedoes 
                    bit you, George. Find Emily. Beedoes! 
                    Emily ...

      Beedoes rattles his little cage.

                    Beedoes picks up the trail.

      Buck opens his lap top, which makes BLEEPING AND BUZZING 
      noises.

                                  GEORGE
                    All right, all right. I give up.

                    Look!

      Susan, George, Buck, all look at the cage to see Beedoes 
      jumping up and down, then changes towards the right side of 
      his cage.

                                  SUSAN
                    He keeps running to that corner.

      Buck looks at a compass, taps into his lap top.

                    Due west, Dad.

                    So when you hit Carter Street hang a right.
                    George makes the right.

      Beedoes' CHEEPS rise in pitch as they've gone down the 
      trail and it's getting hotter.

      Even George seems momentarily surprised at such a definite 
      reaction from Beedoes.


      Darkness.

      A big regulation clock behind chicken wire reads 6 A.M.,       Sikes has been at it all night, no luck.

      The Purist who pulled the gun on him sits tied to his 
      chair.

      A table is between them and a night stick rests on it 
      attracting the Purists' gaze, and a SECOND COP is finishing 
      a container of yogurt, exhausted.

      Cop looks at Sikes, then at the Purist who is painfully 
      aware of what may happen now as he watches the cop exit.

      Sikes exhales slowly, tired.

      Purist considers this, gestures with his head for Sikes to 
      come over.

      PFFFT!

      Purist spits In Sikes' face. Sikes lunges for him throwing 
      the chair over backwards with a tremendous crash as Purist 
      SCREAMS. Other cops and Dobbs come in, tear Sikes off.

      The cops drag the chair out with the Purist, whose nose is 
      bleeding, CRYING OUT about police brutality.

      Dobbs hands Sikes a hanky, steadies the swinging light,       concerned.

      Dobbs shakes his head, leaves. Sikes goes to the window, 
      looks out on the vast city and looks at the TICKING clock.


      Susan hands George a cup of coffee, looks at Beedoes as 
      Buck is TAPPING away at his lap top, as they get caught in 
      traffic.

      George drives away. His police walkie-talkie remains atop 
      the gas pump beside the large courtesy clock which reads 10 
      A.M.

      blinds, TAPPING away at a computer, surrounded by stacks of

      Sikes has become disenchanted, physically and emotionally, 
      he looks up at her like it's not going to work. The racist 
      line she's been spouting has ruined the moment.

      Cheryl has not a clue, SIGHS, disappointed as to why he's 
      stalled, she stands, buttons up.

                                  SIKES
                              (apologetic)
                    It's been a rough night. I'm fried and...                                  CHERYL
                          (an edge)
                    Hey, it happens to everyone, all right?

      Cheryl is pissed, she exits.

      Sikes rubs his face, rolls his eyes as if to say "what was 
      that?" Computer buzzes, Sikes goes over, turns to the 
      computer that indicates it has finished it's search as a 
      printer begins to print out:

      Three faces, Carduzo, Bullins, Shrake ...


      Sikes enters to find two hundred breakfast bags, filling 
      the room, more coming. Sikes looks at Dobbs for an 
        explanation, who looks at Albert who's putting a huge wad 
      of cash in the P.A.L. box.

                                  DOBBS
                    Albert got the hang of 3-card Monte, beat 
                    Rapper Jack at his own game, bought the 
                    whole precinct brunch including prisoners, 
                    and still popped a grand into the P.A.L. 
                    fund. I'm introducing him to the lottery 
                    next.

      Sikes places the printout photos on Dobbs' desk...


      Wolf, Rabbit and Frog are playing cards at a table, with a 
      loud windup TICKING CLOCK which reads 5:00 P.M. on the 
      table.

      EMILY

      sits bound in a little chair which rests on a square piece 
      of steel in the center of the room.                                  RABBIT
                    Five hours left.

                                  FROG
                    This wasn't how it was going to work.

                                  WOLF
                    There's still time.

                                  RABBIT
                    They've had plenty of time.

                                  FROG
                    He's right.

      Wolf grabs him.

                                  WOLF
                    We play out the string!

                                  RABBIT
                    I say we cut our losses.

      Emily is listening to them carefully, coloring in a 
      Newcomer coloring book.

                                  WOLF
                    Five hours to go ...

      Rabbit removes his head mask CARDOZO, a big man with rat-
      smart eyes.

                                  WOLF
                    Don't be stupid!

      Frog removes his mask to reveal his face to be that of 
      Bullins.

                                  FROG
                    You're the one who's been dumb!

      Cardozo rips the mask off Shrake, the woman paramedic. She 
      is big, tough looking, determined, in control, who cringes, 
      and they all turn towards Emily.

                                  EMILY

      as Sikes hands the dispatcher a computer printout.

                                  DISPATCHER
                    All units, the suspects car is thought to 
                    be a nineteen sixty-eight Dodge, license 
                    plate

      Sikes gulps his coffee, looks at a digital clock 7 P.M.


      as George winces each time Beedoes CHEEPS! Louder than 
      before.

                                  GEORGE
                    What's wrong with him?

                                  BUCK
                    He's homing in, Dad.

      Buck continues working his lap top.

                                  BUCK
                    Next street is Harbor.

                                  SUSAN
                    He keeps nudging west.

                                  BUCK
                    Right, Dad.

                                  GEORGE
                            (resigned)
                    Right it is.

      George turns right

      Beedoes cuts loose with a SCREECH that is ear shattering, 

      Emily, faced by Cardozo and Sullins, hands them two three 
      penny nails, raising questions on their crude faces.

                                  EMILY
                    Here ...

                                    CARDOZO
                    What? What for?

                                  EMILY
                    To help you.

                                    BULLINS
                    I don't get it.

                                  EMILY
                    You've removed your masks. You're in a 
                    difficult position. In order to protect 
                    your identity you must prevent me from 
                      identifying you at a later date.

                                    CARDOZO
                    Yeah. So?

                                  EMILY
                    Use these to blind me and you protect your 
                      identities ...

      Cardozo and Bullins look at one another horrified at the 
      thought; they may be killers but they're not mutilators.

                                    CARDOZO
                    This is sick...

      His nails fall.

                                  EMILY
                    I assure you the choice between blindness 
                    and death was not difficult for me. The 
                    blind lead very productive lives.

      Bullins drops his nails, backs away.

      An AMUSED LAUGH rings out.

      Cardozo and Bullins both turn to:      Shrake, still at the card table, she enjoys their 
      revulsion.

                                  SHRAKE
                    Weaklings ...

                                    CARDOZO
                    Listen, Shrake, if you're so --

      Cardozo stops himself, he gave away a name.

      Emily is now scared.

      Shrake rises, amazed at the stupidity of her accomplices.

                                  SHRAKE
                    We're past names and faces. Strong measures 
                    are what win the day.

      Shrake goes to a large tool box, which piques Cardozo and 
      Bullins' interest.


      and Beedoes is braying louder than before. They must hold 
      their ears.

                                  GEORGE
                    It hurts.

                                  BUCK
                    That's the building, Dad. Gotta be.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'll radio for backup.

      George looks for his walkie-talkie, remembers.

                                  GEORGE
                    The gas pump... All right, you two get to a 
                    phone, give them the address and tell them

                    Code Two.

                                  SUSAN
                    What are you doing?

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm going in.

                                  SUSAN
                    George, no.

      Susan tries to stop him. George will have none of it.

                                  GEORGE
                    If she's inside, there's no time to wait. 
                    Buck, drive away slowly, without noise.

      Buck nods, closes his lap top, climbs into the driver's 
      seat, takes the wheel, George gets out.


      as George is cautiously stalking through a series of broken 
      down cranes, machine parts, revolver ready as: CHEEP! 
      CHEEP!

      Beedoes pokes a head from George's breast pocket, and is 
      summarily shoved back inside. George senses a presence, 
      stops moving, listens: DRIPPING WATER.

      Beedoes growls.

      FOOTFALLS, several sets, echo, crisp and clean on gravel 
      and concrete, clipped staccato beat; someone is moving 
      quickly.

      George rushes to a stack of iron bars, old machinery, 
      scrambles up to get a glimpse through an old multi-paned 
      window fogged, greasy. George sees:

      A sedan pull out, dented, old, with three silhouettes 
      inside, the sound of MUFFLED LAUGHTER, as it reaches the 
      street, burns rubber.

      George hears a RUSTLE, a movement behind him, whirls, ready 
      to fire at:

      Pigeons, several of them fluttering about, resting on old 
      beams.

      George breathes easier, climbs back onto the ground, 
      advances as:


      GEORGE

      Stalking through the darkness, past the rubble, smeared 
      with dirt and grease, looks at his watch:

      Watch: 9:30 1 hour left.

      CHEEP! CHEEP!

      Beedoes cuts loose louder than when we heard him before, 
      and George jumps.

                                  GEORGE
                    Right ... cheep... cheep...

      George continues on as if Beedoes had goaded him to do 
      so...


      SIKES

      standing in a prison corridor, looking into a cell at:

      MRS. BRETT, the PURIST LEADER, Purist tattoo on her arm,       defiant eyes, curled lips, snapping down cards in a fast 
      game of solitaire.

      Mrs. Brett turns at this, stops playing solitaire. Smoke 
      spins from her cigarette, she studies Sikes keenly.

                                  MRS. BRETT
                    A real "child?" Or a Slag child?

      Sikes does not answer but Mrs. Brett takes the silence as 
      an affirmative, smiles.

                                  MRS. BRETT
                    As I see it, we got ourselves a win-win

                    You ain't as stupid as you look.

      Sikes turns, leaves, walks towards an exit door, and sees 
      the clock behind the chicken wire which reads: 9:35 P.M. 25 
      minutes.

                                  MRS. BRETT

      Her laughter echoes.


      GEORGE

      stops at a large door, looks about, checks his gun as:

      Beedoes, in his breast pocket, is CHEEPING!

      George, using his Newcomer strength, tears open a new 
      padlock, pulls back a door to reveal an:

      Empty loading bay.

      George is ready to give up, is now not as cautious as he 
      was upon arriving, sags back against the wall as:

      Beedoes springs from his pocket, scurries across the floor 
      toward an old door at the far end of the loading dock.

      Beedoes now makes a HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING NOISE louder than 

      It lives up to it's name, neon, smoke, juke box, leather. 
      Sikes enters, pulls his badge.

                                  SIKES
                    Police!

      Most patrons drop the contraband on the floor, Shrake, 
      Bullins and Cardozo slowly swivel on their stools to face 
      Sikes as he comes up to them.

                                  SIKES

      Cardozo, the biggest, block tackles Sikes into a table, 
      lifts a gumball machine to finish Sikes who delivers a 
      swift face kick, twists into Bullins, who had a knife 
      coming up fast as Shrake lunges, and she is hurled onto the 
      bar, knocked out cold.

      Motorcycle cop rushes in, looks at the carnage as Sikes 
      sinks against the bar, chances to notice Shrake's muddy 
      boats, sees:

      Clumps of reddish metal, dirt, iron tailings.

      Sikes pauses, looks at the boots of the other Purists, 
      finds the exact same deposits.

      GEORGE

      poised, pulls off the padlock, zips open the metal door, 
      enters, Beedoes in his windbreaker pocket, into:

      The cavernous inner room and in the center of the room, 
      under a skylight, sitting on a little chair, gagged, is 
      Emily.

      DEAD.

      George takes a step as Beedoes SHRIEKS, baleful moaning, 
      horrified.

                                  GEORGE
                    Emily!

      George's ANGUISHED CRY reverberates through the warehouse 
      as he drops his gun, realizes he has arrived too late to       save his daughter.

      Emily stirs, sits up, looks around, sees George who 
      joyously reacts, starts towards her.

                                  GEORGE
                    Baby?

      Emily, who is unable to call out, to speak, is openly 
      frightened now, shaking her head as George approaches, 
      reaches her, pulls the gag off her mouth.

                                  GEORGE
                    You're alive, you're alive.

                                  EMILY
                    Daddy, listen to me, please. It's dangerous 
                    here.

                    You're safe now. It's all right. I'm here, 
                    I'm, here ...

                                  EMILY
                    No. It's not all right, it's not.

                    What is it, Emily?

                                  EMILY
                    A bomb. We're standing on a bomb!

      George looks down, sees they are standing on a 5 x 5 sheet 
      of steel.

                                  EMILY
                      I pretended to fall asleep and heard them 
                    talking about how it would go off if 
                    someone removed me from my seat or if no 
                    one found me it would go off at ten o'clock 
                    as they told you.

                                  GEORGE
                    Ten minutes ...                                  EMILY
                    I'm sorry, Daddy. I tried to warn you.

      George kisses Emily, undoes the binding, embraces her.

                                  GEORGE
                    Whatever happens, it happens to both of us, 
                    pumpkin.

      Emily kisses George on the cheek.

      BANG! Noise from outside, Beedoes SHRIEKS, as from the 
      shadows steps:

      Sikes, gun drawn, cautious, relieved.

                                  SIKES
                    Am I interrupting anything?

                                  GEORGE
                    Don't come any farther!

                                  SIKES
                    Is that any way to greet the cavalry?

                                  EMILY
                    We're sitting on a booby trap!

      Sikes pauses, looking to George who confirms.

                                  GEORGE
                    If what Emily says is correct, under this 
                    steel plate you'll find a bomb, pressure 
                    rigged, timed to go off in ten minutes, 
                    actually it's nine minutes now...

      Sikes looks about, sees the lantern left on the card table, 
      takes it, advances towards the plate, lowers the light.

                                  SIKES
                    Hello, Mr. Claymore...

                                  GEORGE
                    The bomb squad?                                  SIKES
                    Never make it. It's us ...

                                  GEORGE
                    Don't be crazy.

                                  SIKES
                    Who's being subjective now, George?

      Sikes rushes about looking for something, sees a large 
      dolly, a wagon of sorts, used to move heavy equipment, but 
      it's old, rusted, heavy.

                                  GEORGE
                    It's going to blow in eight minutes, that's 
                    a given, if we move off the plate it goes, 
                    that's a given.

                                  EMILY
                      A Hobson's choice.

                                  SIKES
                    A what?

                                  GEORGE
                    The kind of choice where whatever
                    you do you lose.

      Sikes gets behind the wagon, rolls up his sleeves, takes a 
      deep breath.

                    What are you doing?

                                  SIKES
                    What I'm doing is rolling this dolly onto 
                    the plate as a counter weight. The minute 
                    it makes contact, you dive behind that pig 
                    iron over there.

                                  GEORGE
                    This seems risky.                                  SIKES
                    Hey, I'm open for suggestions!

                    Don't be negative, Daddy.
                          (to Sikes)
                    We're ready.
                          (to George)
                    Right, Dad?

      RAPID FIRE INTERCUTS ON:

      SIKES, pausing.

      THE WAGON, not moving.

      GEORGE, watching, skeptical.

      THE WAGON, remaining immobile.

      EMILY, encouraging Sikes.

      THE BOMB, continuing to TICK.

      BEEDOES, whimpering with anguish.

      SIKES, straining, veins popping, sweating, GRUNTING, 
      stopping, looking at:

      GEORGE, SIGHING, looking at his watch: 2 minutes.

      EMILY, seeing Sikes can't do it.

                                  EMILY
                    You did your best, that's what counts.

      GEORGE, embracing Emily.

                                  GEORGE
                    You are the best daughter a dad ever had.

                                  EMILY
                    You're tops too, Dad, but you don't have to 
                    talk me through this...

      SIKES, SCREAMING a karate "kiyeh" to pump his adrenaline 
      strains and sweats.      THE WAGON, MOVING, rusty wheels move, then halt.

      GEORGE AND EMILY, resigning to defeat, turn at the sound of 
      SCREECHING METAL.

      SIKES, CRYING OUT even louder now and the wagon crawls, 15 
      feet, 14, 13, 12.

      GEORGE, starting to hope.

      EMILY, CHEERING.

      SIKES, pushing the wagon to within 5 feet, it stops.

      GEORGE, closing his eyes, terrified.

      EMILY, falling silent.

      SIKES, gasping for air, digging in with his track shoulder, 
      closing his eyes, SCREAMING.

      THE WAGON, lurching forward, onto the plate, rolling under 
      it's own momentum.

                                  SIKES
                    JUMP!

      GEORGE, Emily, diving off the plate. The wagon RUMBLES onto 
      the plate as:

      BOOM!

      The bomb, igniting in a fireball.


      Dust, silence, as:      GEORGE

      who landed, covering Emily with his body, looks up, no sign 
      of Sikes.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matt?

      Sikes crawls out from behind a pile of machinery, bruised, 
      filthy, exhausted, but jubilant.

                                  SIKES
                    Tell me, George, you call this being off 
                    active duty?

      The door bursts open and in comes the SWAT TEAM, backup 
      Cops, who radio the all clear sign as:

      Susan and Buck rush to George and Emily, are reunited, 
      embrace, kiss, tears, with Beedoes jumping about. Sikes 
      watches, apart for a beat, understands truly now how the 
      Newcomers may be different, but they're like us in the most 
      important way. ...the ability to love. Emily comes over to 
      Sikes.

                                  EMILY
                    Thanks for saving my family, Uncle Matt.

      Sikes, kneels, is embraced by Emily.

                          (a whisper in his ear)

      Cathy is on her way to work, opens the hall door for Sikes, 
      who is putting his key in the lock.

                    You're hurt.

      Sikes touches his cheek, somewhat surprised that there is a 
      wound.

                                  SIKES
                    It's just a scratch.

                    Tell you what; I won't tell you how to do 
                    your job, you don't tell me mine. Deal?

                    ...Deal.

      Cathy nods to him, "follow me".


      where Cathy takes off her coat, has Sikes sit on the chair 
      near the kitchen, fetches bandages, a wash cloth, and 
      Neosporin. She cleans the wound, touches his cheek.

      Sikes does not flinch, he's come a long way in the past 24 
      hours.

      Their eyes meet; we:
