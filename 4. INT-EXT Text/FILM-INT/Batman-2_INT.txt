The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
snow -- no traction.
They're about to climb out and give
chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
Salvation Army SANTA...
...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.
The
windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
burdened with LOOT.
MORE SIRENS.
A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
streets which is relatively clear.
The COP at the wheel goes
wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.
Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.
COP
What the hell -- ?
His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
from the front of the car.
Cool as ever -- approaching the
chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.
The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
over the hilly terrain of the park.
He spots two of them up
ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
left and right...
ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING
PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
into place.
The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
disappear.
ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING
The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
GAINING FAST.
He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
always seems to follow.
Just as he approaches the crest of a
hill...
...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.
The
force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.
His LOOT lands
in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.
ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING
This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.
When he sees
the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
GROVE OF TREES.
The trees are too closely spaced for the
torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
explodes harmlessly.
The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
Batmobile can't follow either.
But BATMAN has a Plan B.
As
he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
passing the snowmobile on its left.
A STEEL SPIKE attached to
a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
ITSELF into a distant TREE.
The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
path of the second SNOWMOBILE.
The vehicle crashes into the
trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
heels into a drift.
In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
ready for mop-up duty.
BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.
He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
purchase.
He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --
Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
vanishing into the distance.
He opens (yet another) panel on
the dashboard...
where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
with extreme dismay.
As he trims the crusts from a pair of
hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.
ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
the mike...
SEKOWSKY (on TV)
We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
alive in this city.
We're gonna take back
the streets!
SEKOWSKY raises a fist.
Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
chant: "TAKE BACK THE STREETS!
TAKE BACK THE STREETS!"
Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
flicks it off.
He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
"Good King Wenceslas" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
Sterling silver tea service.
The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
mahogany desk.
He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
side drawer.
The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads "THOMAS WAYNE
MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."
ALFRED digs
around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
the rear of the drawer.
Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...
Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
"Good King Wenceslas" is on the speakers down here as well.
Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
wrapped in a tarp.
ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
service down.
He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
simultaneously.
He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
BRUCE.
ALFRED
Sir?
-- MASTER BRUCE??
As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
recesses of the cavern.
ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS.
BRUCE
I'm not deaf, Alfred.
I hear you.
He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
buckled about his waist.
Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
midair for a moment, dangling over the void.
ALFRED slowly
regains his composure:
ALFRED
I took the liberty of preparing tea.
(indicating tbe monitors)
I take it you've been watching the news?
BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
and nods.
BRUCE
Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.
BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.
He kicks off
on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.
Preoccupied, he drops
his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.
ALFRED
I should inform you...Christmas is
approaching, and we've received our annual
solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
(eyeing the equipment)
If I may inquire...?
BRUCE
Oh, yeah.
Watch this.
BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
tubing.
The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
like the skeleton of an umbrella.
ALFRED
Most ingenious, sir.
What exactly
it?
BRUCE
What does it look like?
ALFRED
To the untrained eye, sir, it looks
remarkably like...the skeleton of an
umbrella.
Sounds good.
BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over,
smiles slyly.
BRUCE
Good guess, Alfred.
That's exactly right.
BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss.
He
sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap,
pours a cup of tea.
ALFRED
Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad
you're putting your time to such
productive use.
(beat)
Now -- the Toy Fund.
Our contribution
last year was a half-million dollars...
BRUCE
We can do better than that.
ALFRED
Then there's the foster-parents program...
the Gotham homeless crusade...
BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich.
He seems
oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts
are obviously a million miles away.
ALFRED looks on,
concerned:
ALFRED (cont.)
Is something troubling you, sir?
BRUCE
Yeah...the holidays, I guess.
Always gets
me thinking about...
(he changes the subject)
And to tell you the truth, I'm a little --
concerned about Vicki.
ALFRED
(anxiously)
Miss Vale, sir...?
BRUCE
Yeah.
I've been thinking about it lately.
Thinking about it a lot...
(gravely; shaking his head)
...and I still can't figure out what to
get her for Christmas.
BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED
heaves an audible sigh of relief as we
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare
concrete wall.
Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen
of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons,
cardinals, titwillows...
CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY
ODD FIGURE in prison greys.
A CANARY, perched on his
shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy,
cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS
with quick, birdlike strokes.
MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems
his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is
"obscene."
Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports
himself with overblown, theatrical dignity.
Fastidious and
preening, he does not suffer insults lightly.
CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars --
and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged.
A PRISON
GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door...
GUARD
Up and at 'em, Pengy.
-- Pengy?
MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to
acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname.
GUARD (cont.)
Boniface...
MR. BONIFACE finally turns.
With an expression of extreme
distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the
canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.
MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from
the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD.
PAROLE OFFICER
You want to return the money you stole.
BONIFACE
Intact.
The map will show you where it's
buried.
The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP.
PAROLE OFFICER
All of it.
Forty-two million dollars.
MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds
the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to
bear.
PAROLE OFFICER II
Why this sudden change of heart?
MR. BONIFACE
Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in
full.
I want to be a part of civilized
society!
(oozing sincerity)
Prison life is not for me.
The guilt, the
fear, the constant shame...one meets a
disturbingly low class of people.
PAROLE OFFICER II
Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars??
MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively.
It's quite a perfomlance.
He
dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and
he's the delicate type...
WARDEN
His record's clean.
Thirteen years
without an incident.
ATTORNEY
I'd like to point out, my client's put his
time to good use.
A student of
ornithology...articles published in
several respected journals...
The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird
World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg.
MR. BONIFACE
Birds, yes.
My only source of solace.
PAROLE OFFICER
In light of this rather extraordinary
gesture, I see no reason not to endorse
your application for parole.
BONIFACE
Thank you, sir.
You won't regret it.
MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE
BOARD.
As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD
SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office:
MYNAH
CRIME DOES NOT PAY.
AAWWK!!
CRIME DOES
NOT PAY.
CHUCKLES all around.
On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures
toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board:
ATTORNEY
Personally trained by my client.
Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are
milling around in the common area.
T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb,
hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate,
MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES.
BONIFACE
whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH
RAGE:
MR. BONIFACE
-- Where are my birds?!?
T-BONE
Shit, Pengy.
I let 'em go.
MR. BONIFACE
Hermione.
My canary.
It's the dead of
winter!
T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR.
BONIFACE's profound distress.
T-BONE
They were all cooped up.
With you leaving
and all -- seemed like the humane thing to
do.
BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell.
He spots a
scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD.
With
a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile...
MR. BONIFACE
I see.
-- You might as well have this.
I
won't be needing it...
He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on.
The dim
strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the
earphones...
T-BONE
Well, thanks, Pengy.
No hard feelings.
(chuckling to himself)
Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little
ass of yours.
T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset
on, grins from his bunk.
TWO GUARDS arrive.
As they escort
him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters:
MR. BONIFACE
You won't miss it long.
Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning
to show.
His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his
own ingenuity.
PENGUIN
I take it they found the money all right?
FRACK
We buried it exactly as you specified.
$42,271,009...
PENGUIN
How much have we got left?
FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET.
FRICK
Let's see -- an initial capitalization of
42 million and change, compounded over
thirteen years, at an annual return of
just under sixteen percent --
PENGUIN
Fine, fine.
How much?
FRICK
Seventy-nine million.
-- Excluding the
sum we buried.
THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a
normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK.
He checks his watch and
reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE.
PENGUIN
Speaking of burials...
ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out
on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy.
She pulls
him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek.
VICKI
Guess what, Alfred.
I think I found a
present for Bruce.
She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the
exterior wall.
At first it doesn't want to fit through the
door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help
she gets it inside.
The faithful butler stares curiously at
this odd-shaped gift...
VICKI (cont.)
Skis.
-- Don't let on, okay?
ALFRED
He won't hear a word of it from me.
VICKI
He's such a nightmare to shop for.
--
What do you get him year after year,
Alfred?
ALFRED
(conspiratorially)
I find you can't go wrong with
surveillance equipment.
Let me put this
under the tree...
VICKI
Not so fast.
She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another
small gift.
ALFRED stares at the tag -- "TO ALFRED, LOVE
VICKI" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN.
ALFRED
Why, Miss Vale -- !
VOICE FROM BEHIND
What's all this?
ALFRED and VICKI turn.
It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner,
marching down the long stairway in the entry hall.
VICKI
waves frantically.
VICKI
Don't look.
It's your present.
VICKI rushes over to embrace him.
He gapes at the long skinny
box --
BRUCE
What'd you get me?
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss.
She nestles up against
him.
WHISPERS in his ear:
VICKI
I'm going to give you the happiest
Christmas you've ever had.
Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED.
Taking
the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one
end of the ski box.
He backs out of the entry hall, dragging
the box before him...
CUT TO:
BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the
demonstration.
VICKI
Homeless.
(beat)
I was just down here Tuesday.
Seems like
there's more every day.
BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to
say.
VICKI (cont.)
Christmas time.
And they say there's over
a thousand people living in the park
already.
BRUCE
-- Yeah.
The light changes.
BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at
the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park.
Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to
Gotham's elite.
A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has
been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of
PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as
BRUCE'S CAR pulls up.
A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in
concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush.
The liveried
DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience
-- as they enter.
Post-dinner.
VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the
table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being
forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their
SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park.
VICKI
They're already razing the tenements and
SRO's downtown.
These people don't have
anyplace else to go.
(beat)
If the city starts selling off the park...
BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings.
HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the
park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance...
BRUCE
-- Yeah.
I guess I'll pass on dessert.
VICKI
(taking his hand)
Bruce, you do a lot more than most people
even dream of.
BRUCE
Sure.
Comes off the top of my taxes --
VICKI
That's not what I meant.
They exchange a long silent look.
Of course she's referring
to Batman.
Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with
BRUCE.
BRUCE
-- What I "do" doesn't come close to the
root of the problem, Vicki.
(long pause)
I'm just a Band-Aid.
VOICE FROM BEHIND
Bruce!
It's been ages!
VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder.
Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the
restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE.
BRUCE
Randall.
You remember Vicki.
-- How's
the construction business?
SHAW
The park tower?
All systems go.
If we
can get the junkies and winos cleared
out...
(a big grin)
Not too late to get in on the deal.
BRUCE
I'll think about it.
SHAW
Say, Walter Barrett's due back from
Europe.
We should all get together at the
club.
(clapping him on the shoulder)
Nice to see you again,
Miss Veal.
"Miss Veal" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to
the next table.
She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth:
VICKI
What a pig.
BRUCE
I've known him since he was seven years
old.
He was a pig then too.
VICKI
Now he wants to gobble up the park...
(shivering)
Bruce -- isn't there something you can do
about people like that?
BRUCE
What, tie him up with a bat-rope?
VICKI
No, you idiot.
I meant you.
Bruce.
BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah.
Subtle distinction.
BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant.
He hands his
parking stub to a VALET.
A crowd's beginning to form in the
lot outside...
The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short
distance off, near the entrance to the park.
TWO RED BERETS,
in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged
WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS.
BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a
little closer -- within eavesdropping range:
RED BERET I
We were on patrol.
Saw the whole thing.
JOGGER
I was attacked.
Three men in ski masks --
COP I
(indicating the RED BERETS)
And these two broke it up?
JOGGER
These two??
They ran like rabbits.
I
never saw anybody take off so --
RED BERET II
Hey!
Somebody had to go for the cops.
COP II
You.
SHUT UP, all right??
(to the JOGGER)
Lady, who was it that bailed you out??
JOGGER
A kid.
Thirteen or fourteen tops.
He
just came out of nowhere and -- tore into
'em.
(shaking her head)
It was so quick I didn't even see his
face.
Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who
responds with a mystified shrug.
Her professional curiosity
piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER.
An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime
site:
RED BERET I
Dumb shit.
Shouldn'ta been jogging in the
park at night anyway.
(sullenly)
Look around you.
It's fulla bums.
BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he
passes.
BRUCE
Nice outfit.
RED BERET I
Piss off, geek.
DISSOLVE TO:
A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack.
The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving
up for their next tattoo.
A TV over the bar is tuned to the
late news:
ANCHORWOMAN
...and tomorrow, the city's power elite
will be turning out in force to greet
millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett,
who returns to Gotham after a five-year
stay in Europe...
The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the
rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett.
None,
that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who
gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner.
Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens
her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic,
vaguely Eurasian features.
She's dark and elegant, fine-
boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know
it yet, is SELINA KYLE.
She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf
Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir.
A LONGSHOREMAN
at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the
felt.
Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she
finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene
indifference.
The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops.
The
only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY,
who's still on the phone:
RICKY
Yo.
Ricky here.
What's the haps?
In mid-conversation he notices SELINA.
She smiles invitingly
-- right at him.
Mildly startled, he smiles back.
RICKY (cont.)
Midnight.
No sweat.
See you then.
He hangs up eagerly.
Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up
his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar.
SELINA
Well.
"Ricky," is it?
RICKY
How'd you know that?
SELINA
I heard you on the phone.
Talking to your
girlfriend.
RICKY
Girlfriend?
No, no.
That was business.
SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves.
SELINA
If you've got time for a little pleasure
...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.
She clasps his hand.
His EYES BUG OUT.
Three enormous rings,
a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks
on her left hand alone.
RICKY gapes at the sparklers,
bedazzled.
RICKY
Jeez -- they look almost real.
SELINA
Why wouldn't they be?
RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought
is all too evident.
He swallows hard and tries not to stare.
RICKY
You'd have to be crazy.
Nobody'd wear the
real thing to a dive like this.
SELINA
Oh, they're real, all right.
So are
these.
She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp
-- in front of his eyes.
With lightning speed, before he can
react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick
stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand.
SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock.
He tries to jerk
his hand away, but he can't break her grip.
Then -- her
dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a
coy, Cheshire-cat smile.
SELINA (cont.)
Weren't we going to have a drink?
He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily.
She takes his
wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at
the blood.
RICKY is hypnotized.
She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow
-- intriguing.
He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals
to the BARTENDER.
CUT TO:
The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with
the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them,
all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on
special perches mounted in the walls.
At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL.
ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a
wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water.
Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the
Gotham Zoological Gardens.
A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface.
It's
not a whale; it's too pink.
It is, instead, the PENGUIN --
and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK
standing in the open doorway.
FRICK
Mr. Boniface?
Your...visitor has arrived.
PENGUIN
Thank you, Mr. Frick.
Show her in.
The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool.
Two of his
LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a
long chain, into place over his head.
He grasps it with both
hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk
out of the water.
FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either
side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued
plumage.
CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we
can't see her face, there must be something distinctively
feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and
fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she
strolls past.
FRICK opens a door and ushers her into...
Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room.
Her teeth begin to chatter.
The big bay windows have been
thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's
freezing in here.
She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an
APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on
the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the
cold.
He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the
back of SELINA's hand.
PENGUIN
Ah, Miss Kyle!
At last we meet.
SELINA
At last we meet.
-- Pigeons?
PENGUIN
Yes, they're common birds -- dirty,
stupid, unattractive -- but they're very
obedient, and they do crap on people's
heads.
May I?
She extends a SHOPPING BAG.
The PENGUIN removes a parcel and
unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE.
He sets it on a
nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA.
PENGUIN (cont.)
I see your reputation was not exaggerated.
SELINA
I've located the others.
All but one.
(shivering)
I'm surprised you don't catch
pneumonia -- !
With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut.
PENGUIN
My normal body temperature is ninety-two
degrees.
Germs find me inhospitable.
SELINA
I see why they call you the Penguin.
PENGUIN
They may call me that...but rarely more
than once.
Champagne?
She nods.
He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a
toast.
PENGUIN (cont.)
My dear.
Here's to the second biggest
crime in the history of Gotham City.
CUT TO:
COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in
darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room.
BULLOCK
It wasn't about the drugs.
Whoever it was
left thirty kilos sitting on the docks.
They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a
terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story.
It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his
voice is audible over a concealed intercom:
JULIO (filter)
Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y
garras -- el demonio.
El murcielago.
MURCIELAGO!
GORDON
What's that he keeps saying?
BULLOCK
"Murcielago."
-- Bat.
GORDON
Nonsense.
That dock looked like a
slaughter-house.
Batman's never committed
murder.
BULLOCK
We did find this in his back pocket.
BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD.
It reads: "THOSE WHO FEED ON THE
SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH" -- and in lieu of a
signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom
corner.
While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in:
POLICEMAN
Commissioner?
We've got Barrett.
A cubicle down the hall.
The splenetic WALTER BARRETT,
millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON
enters.
BARRETT
Fine welcome.
These storm troopers of
yours dragged me away from my coming-home
party!
(beat)
I'd like to know the meaning of this --
GORDON
I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure
cocaine wound up concealed in your
personal effects.
BARRETT
Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest
and most influential familles in Gotham.
If you plan to accuse me of smuggling
drugs, be my guest.
(long, menacing pause)
I'll have your badge before you leave this
room.
GORDON weighs the threat.
He nods to the COPS in
attendance...
GORDON
Book the son of a bitch.
GORDON storms out.
BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the
COPS restrain him.
Outraged, he bats their hands away...
BARRETT
I believe I'm still entitled to a phone
call.
CUT TO:
VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing
him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the
SQUATTER FAMILY.
SCHULTZ
Great stuff, but we're looking at a
shitfight with our beloved publisher.
He
and Shaw...
(crossing his fingers)
Old money sticks together.
VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his
car.
VICKI
I'd sure like to know what shook him up
so.
He was out of there like a scared
rabbit...
Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to
SCHULTZ's desk.
WILK
Got a blind tip from downtown.
You know
that massacre on the docks?
Batman.
VICKI reacts in astonishment.
SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is
hot.
EDITOR
Whoa!
Is this on the level?
WILK
Cops even got a note.
"Those who feed on
the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!"
(grinning; to VICKI)
Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a
notch.
VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it.
ALFRED opens the door.
A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the
face:
BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE
Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring
VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's
inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead.
VICKI
Seen the late edition?
ALFRED
I'm afraid so, Miss Vale.
Master Bruce is
sequestered in the cave.
On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the
library.
They pause in front of the television -- which is
tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot
issue of the day.
ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV)
Walter Barrett's no saint.
His factories
have been dumping poison into the air and
water for years.
If he is mixed up with
drugs...
PUNDIT (on TV)
That's not the issue.
The issue is, do we
entrust our public safety to some...masked
vigilante.
Does Batman have a license to
kill?
ALFRED
(shaking his head)
Ah, the public.
Dishearteningly fickle.
VICKI follows ALFRED out.
We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA
PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding
air time.
He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT:
MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV)
Yo, here's the tip, man.
Drug dealers are
scum.
If Batman did wax these punks...SO
WHAT?
They deserved it!
End of
discussion.
ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep
quiet.
He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER
GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker...
GORDON (O.S.; filter)
Anyone could've written that note.
GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS --
blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping.
CITY OFFICIAL I
And I suppose anyone could've taken out a
boatload of armed thugs.
A dozen men, Jim
-- murdered in cold blood --
GORDON
Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds
of lives!
CITY OFFICIAL II
He's still a vigilante.
We don't know who
he is, where he comes from, why he does
it...
CITY OFFICIAL I
Street punks are one thing, Jim.
This is
Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of
mine!
As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a
COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.
We see the tiny TRADEMARK
embossed on the CPU -- "WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES."
as he LISTENS through his concealed bug.
CITY OFFCIAL II
You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least
for questioning.
It would sure help if we
could get that mask off...
BRUCE shuts the recorder off.
He turns to face ALFRED and
VICKI --
BRUCE
Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed.
CUT TO:
TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE
whizzes past on the street.
The DRIVER pulls out behind it as
the second COP grabs his radio mike...
COP
One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview
north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat
10-78.
VOICE ON RADIO (filter)
10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37,
repeat 10-37.
Backup on the way.
At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone.
We're
in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction
magnate.
There's obviously money to be made in real-estate
development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the
floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in
Gotham.
At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new
Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows.
An
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back
to the camera...
WOMAN
It's a fake.
SHAW
Hmm.
It cost me a half a million dollars.
You're sure?
WOMAN
Absolutely.
You see, I...happen to know
where the real one is stashed.
The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed.
He
seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the
moment, art is not the first thing on his mind.
CAMERA STAYS
ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on
his mysterious guest.
SHAW
I guess you'd know.
I have some "friends"
in the art world.
They say that -- for
certain hard-to-get items -- you're the
one to call.
WOMAN (O.S.)
How flattering.
SHAW
They say for the right price...you could
steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel
Wall.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Mr. Shaw.
Do you believe everything you
hear?
SHAW
Oh, I'm not one to judge.
I admire people
who take what they want.
I'm just curious
how you do it.
SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her
face.
It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of
the sofa...
SELINA
I find that the old methods work best.
Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat
smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep,
passionate kiss.
Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW
drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine
across the polished parquet floor.
The action's gone horizontal.
SELINA, peeled down to a sheer
lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat
with quick, lapping kisses.
She rolls off suddenly; when he
tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single
finger.
Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS,
twisting them around into tight cords.
With a coy smile she
runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and
then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and
ties it off on the bedpost.
SHAW
Hey, what are you doing -- ?
He tries to break her grip.
She BACKHANDS him sharply across
the face.
SELINA
You're very inquisitive.
You'll just have
to be disciplined.
An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other
hand to the bedpost.
None too quick, he's just caught on that
all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene.
She crosses quickly
to the bathroom --
SHAW
You know, I've...I've never really done
this kind of thing before.
-- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems
perfectly appropriate in this context.
SELINA
I think people should indulge their
fantasies.
Don't you?
Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches
into an oversized bag.
She withdraws an odd-looking chromium
BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger.
SIX-
INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place.
SHAW's dopey smile
fades...
SHAW
Hey, what are those -- what are you --
He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS
away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby.
A
SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically
pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we
CUT TO:
A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the
entrance of the building.
Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show
various empty hallways throughout the building.
He reaches
for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel
nearby.
The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a
BURGLAR ALARM.
SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE --
concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on
hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of
complete exasperation: oh, shit.
The GUARD'S VOICE crackles
over a nearby intercom:
GUARD (O.S.; filter)
Mr. Shaw?
What's going on up there?
--
Mr. Shaw?
Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts
a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on
the docks.
She slams the door shut and swings the picture
back into place.
There's an awful BANGING at the front door.
SHAW lies under
the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the
ceiling.
SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings
a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders.
She picks up the
nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and
clambers out onto the ledge outside.
Ten seconds later the COPS burst in.
They rush to the bedroom
-- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the
bed --
-- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall.
Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT.
COP
JESUS!
A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed
from a nearby chair.
The cat arches its back -- waits -- and
SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair.
The canary
SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor,
cradles it in her arms...
WOMAN'S VOICE
Now Hecate.
You don't want that scrawny
little bird --
It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black
ensemble.
At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his
customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN.
He
bares his teeth:
PENGUIN
Do you want me to wring that creature's
neck?
SELINA
You try it, I'll do the same to you.
(as he grumbles; bemused)
I saw him, you know.
PENGUIN
Saw who?
SELINA
Batman.
He was dreamy.
She strokes the cat, in a reverie.
The PENGUIN drops his
polishing cloth, startled.
PENGUIN
Dreamy?!?
Are you insane!?
My God --
(sputtering wildly)
Are you sure it was him?
What did he do?
SELINA
He stood on a roof and watched me.
He
didn't realize I'd seen him.
I don't
think he knew quite what to make of me.
(smiling)
But he was definitely interested.
This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing.
(Or
waddling.)
PENGUIN
This scheme of yours is backfiring.
We
don't need him on our tails.
Do you know
how much money is at stake here?
SELINA
Money isn't everything.
(casually)
What's the point if we can't enjoy
ourselves?
She chuckles to herself.
He stares at her in disbelief -- and
SQUAWKS.
CUT TO:
VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down.
She
spots a message in the "in" file.
She takes one look at it,
and her eyes go wide with RAGE.
She storms out in a fury...
Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the
inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe.
He's just opening his mail.
He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI
BARKS at him:
VICKI
WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY?
PROVOST
Close the door.
(waiting for her to calm down)
Your story isn't news.
With Shaw dead --
VICKI
But the project's still going ahead!
If
attacking homeless people in the park
isn't news, I'd like to know what is --
PROVOST
There's a psycho out there in a mask and
cape -- killing off Gotham's most
prominent citizens!
That's news.
(beat)
I've known Randall Shaw all my life.
His
family is in mourning.
And it just so
happens I don't believe in slandering the
dead.
VICKI FUMES.
She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the
eye.
VICKI
Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have
tied up in the Park Tower project?
PROVOST
Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that
remark.
For the sake of your job, I
suggest you do the same.
VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail.
He
finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with
the word "CONFIDENTIAL" underlined three times in ink.
He
tears it open --
-- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents:
a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM...
THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM
WILL SUFFER MY WRATH
CUT TO:
The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the
light to change.
BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his
cellular phone.
BARRETT
It's time we called an emergency meeting
of the Raven Society.
Get back to me...
Looking troubled, he hangs up.
A fat white glob of PIGEON
SHIT splatters across the windshield.
Seconds later --
another SPLAT.
BARRETT (cont.)
Damn pigeons.
DRIVER
Just washed it, too.
The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch.
They hear a tiny
DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield.
BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look.
A small,
blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade
assembly...
OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR
Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million
fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the
intersection.
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the
intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of
BARRETT's car.
BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears
behind him.
ALFRED
The Fluegelheim called again, sir.
They
want to know if you'll be attending the
opening of the new Egyptian exhibit.
BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED
off.
BRUCE
Cancel.
ANCHORWOMAN (on TV)
-- and, citing new evidence in the so-
called string of "millionaire murders,"
Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today
swore out a warrant for the arrest of
Batman.
(beat)
We go now live to Mike Sekowsky,
spokesperson, Order of the Bat.
SEKOWSKY
Jeez!
Talk about gratitude -- !!
At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in
disgust.
ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of
the Batcave.
BRUCE
Well, Alfred, it's official.
I'm a wanted
man.
(beat)
"New evidence"...I've gotta find that
woman.
Did you check the personals?
As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds.
They've got a
visitor.
BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees
COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron
gates of Wayne Manor.
He throws a nervous look at ALFRED.
ALFRED speaks into a
microphone:
ALFRED
Who's there?
GORDON
Jim Gordon, Alfred.
I've got to see
Bruce.
A spooky development.
Does GORDON suspect?
After a moment's
hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in.
ALFRED
Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.
A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures
toward the liquor cabinet.
The Commissioner nods his head no.
He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be
here.
GORDON
Sorry to bother you.
Bruce -- I'll get
right down to it.
You knew Shaw and
Barrett --
BRUCE
I saw them occasionally.
We all sat on
the board of the Fluegelheim...
GORDON
Did you have any...dealings with them,
or --
BRUCE
No.
I never liked the way they did
business.
GORDON
The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped
together in the public mind -- the Five
Families of Gotham, that sort of thing --
and, uh...
(taking a card from his pocket)
Harrison Provost got this in the mail.
BRUCE examines the card, -- "THOSE WHO FEED," etc.
He stares
at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest...
BRUCE
Then Batman is behind all this.
GORDON
Batman or a damned good imitation.
BRUCE
Well.
He's changed tactics, hasn't he.
GORDON
(shrugging; at a loss)
Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a
druglord, major polluter -- they weren't
exactly model citizens.
Who knows, it
could be some crazy social-conscience kind
of thing.
BRUCE
You mean he's going after...the root of
the problem.
GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go.
BRUCE hands him the
card.
GORDON
Let me know if you get one of these.
We'll put all our resources at your
disposal.
BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the
Commissioner out.
A moment later, the butler reappears.
BRUCE
Changed my mind, Alfred.
I'll be dropping
in on the Fluegelheim after all.
CUT TO:
It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian
exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping.
BOARD MEMBERS,
MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets
and evening gowns, making small talk.
AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has
been set up as a wet bar.
On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall,
rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE.
The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and
reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains,
statuary and all.
Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the
goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of
a pointy-eared CAT.
She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four
tiny KITTENS romp at her feet.
BRUCE, who's just arrived, is
taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess...
VICKI
What is it?
BRUCE
I just had a weird sense of deja vu.
He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the
publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate --
the remaining member of Gotham's "Five Families."
The two of
them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't
quite make out...
TIPTREE
Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce.
We owe him that much.
BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them.
PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of
nonchalance.
PROVOST (cont.)
The man's a space cadet.
Let him look out
for himself.
(as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully)
Why, Bruce!
What a delightful surprise.
BRUCE
Good to see you two.
Looks like the Five
Families are suddenly down to three.
(looking around)
In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on
this room right now --
TIPTREE chuckles nervously.
PROVOST is even less amused.
PROVOST
Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?
BRUCE
Not at all.
Commissioner Gordon seems to
think we should all be hiring bodyguards.
TIPTREE
PROVOST
Oh, that's absurd.
I already have.
The two of them glower at each other.
It's like an outtake
from The Newlywed Game.
BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a
vacuous face:
BRUCE
Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would
be after us.
Can you?
PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of
hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party.
It's
SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing
dress slit up to the armpits.
She's holding two glasses of
CHAMPAGNE...
SELINA
You two look like you need a drink.
--
And is this who I think it is?
She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery
SMILE.
He BLINKS, temporarily speechless.
PROVOST
Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne.
SELINA
Our absentee board member!
I've been
wanting to meet you forever.
TIPTREE
Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities.
She brought the Temple over block by
block --
SELINA
You two won't be terribly upset if I
borrow Bruce for a moment, will you?
Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and
dragged him off.
A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his
eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY.
His tongue is practically
hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check.
SELINA
SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE:
SELINA (cont.)
Major contributor.
-- I always seem to
wind up in charge of fund-raising...
BRUCE
I can't imagine why.
SELINA
Tax year's almost over, you know.
I hope
we can count on your usual generous
donation.
(indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE)
Someone's got to set an example for those
two tightwads.
BRUCE
They're proccupied.
This string of
murders --
SELINA
I asked them if they'd consider including
us in their wills.
(chuckling to herself)
They didn't seem a bit amused...
ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT
She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and
their overdressed WIVES.
She glances across the room at the
statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE.
A frown
crosses her face...
ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT
She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the
statue.
SELINA
-- and this is my good friend Bastet, the
Egyptian Cat Goddess.
BRUCE
I think we've already met.
-- This is
quite an expedition you've put together.
SELINA
I'm glad you think so.
I have to say,
Bruce -- you're not at all what I
expected.
BRUCE
Sorry to disappoint you.
SELINA
Oh, it's not that.
Not at all.
It's just
that I'd always heard you were...
BRUCE
What?
SELINA
(coyly)
Oh...sort of a...
BRUCE
(smiling; fascinated)
No.
Come on.
What?
BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered
when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially --
takes his other arm.
The women exchange big, toothy, plastic
smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting
for him to introduce them.
BRUCE
Oh.
Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.
SELINA
The photographer.
I've seen your pictures
in the Gazette.
VICKI
The Globe.
SELINA
Oh, that's right.
The tabloid one.
--
What an original dress!
VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE.
He senses
trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass.
BRUCE
Selina supervised the reconstruction of
the temple.
Brought it back from Egypt...
stone by stone.
VICKI
Really.
She must be awfully tired.
(to SELINA)
How'd you get to be in charge of a huge
project like this?
SELINA
It was easy.
I slept with the Pharoah.
She laughs at her own joke.
VICKI responds with a dry little
chuckle of her own.
SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the
sleeve.
SELINA (cont.)
Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart?
We have
some boring museum business to talk about.
VICKI fumes.
BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him
off out of earshot.
SELINA (cont.)
I.
Short leash.
BRUCE
Pull in the claws, okay?
She's really
terrific.
SELINA
I'm sorry, Bruce.
Sometimes I get a
little...aggressive, you know?
(handing him a card)
Look, I need to talk to you.
Come by
sometime.
I'll give you the private tour.
BRUCE
Wait.
Let me explain about Vicki --
SELINA
(shushing him)
I understand.
Anyone who's that
protective must have a pretty good reason
for it.
She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial,
unmistakably juicy.
Then she's off in pursuit of another
major funder.
BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in
his hands when VICKI rejoins him.
VICKI
How's "business"?
BRUCE
Relax, okay?
I like you better.
He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE.
No
luck.
VICKI
If you're looking for your fellow
millionaires, they left some time back.
CUT TO:
The roof of the Gotham Globe.
A STARLING circles overhead for
a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT.
TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office.
Brass letters on the door read "J. HARRISON PROVOST,
PUBLISHER."
PROVOST, agitated, working late.
He speaks, sotto voce, into
the phone:
PROVOST
Don't worry about that.
I've had the
office swept for bugs.
No one's
listening...
TIPTREE in his paneled study at home.
There's an open bottle
on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard.
His
VOICE QUAVERS:
TIPTREE
It's just so -- unfair.
I mean...it was
over a century ago.
It's not like we're
responsible.
(hollow-eyed)
How could he know?
How could Batman know
about the Raven Society??
PROVOST
Who knows and who cares.
The point is,
it's happened...
He hears a CHIRP and looks up.
It seems to be coming from a
HEATING VENT on the wall.
But then it stops, so he resumes
his conversation --
PROVOST (cont.)
I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm
taking the raven with me.
I suggest you
do the same.
In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny
BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft.
Now
that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY
PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE
taped to its leg.
PROVOST (O.S.)
I'll tell you how to reach me.
And don't
repeat this to anyone.
CUT TO:
The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool.
He's wearing
rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his
arctic birds.
The vents in the windows are open, and the
climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in
fur, stroking her pet cat:
SELINA
He's just another rich idiot.
(chuckling to herself)
The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit
concerned.
PENGUIN
Then he is an idiot.
SELINA
He lives in some big sprawling manor.
I'll have to get inside, scope it out...
see where he's got the raven stashed.
PENGUIN
How do you plan to do that?
SELINA
How do you think!
A feline smile from SELINA.
The PENGUIN chuckles to himself,
lobs a FISH out over the pool.
A swooping GULL snatches it
out of the air before it hits the water.
FRICK arrives in the
doorway.
FRICK
It's Mr. Provost, sir.
He's planning to
embark on an unscheduled Christmas
vacation.
PENGUIN
Good!
That should save us a trip to the
bank.
CUT TO:
A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk:
archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a
healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over.
This
is SELINA's private domain.
CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case
full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens...
BRUCE
What have we got here?
SELINA
Mummified cats.
Bastet's sacred animal.
They were buried by the thousands at
Bubastis.
-- Oh, careful!
BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen
JARS.
Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape,
jackal, man, falcon.
SELINA (cont.)
Canopic jars.
In the process of
mummification, the internal organs were
buried separately.
(pointing to each jar in turn)
Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine --
BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder.
BRUCE
You're in a gruesome line of work.
SELINA
Keeps me interested.
And that's not easy
to do...
BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd
beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON.
BRUCE
This one I know.
It's a gryphon, right?
SELINA
Very good.
A mythical demon, half-bird,
half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to
deliver retribution and justice.
BRUCE nods.
He can dig it.
He regards the gryphon for a long
moment and CHUCKLES.
BRUCE
Poor guy.
Birds and cats -- you wouldn't
think the two halves would cooperate.
SELINA
Only under certain circumstances.
(beat)
I'm really glad you came, Bruce.
I was
afraid I'd given you the wrong impression.
Or maybe it was the right impression.
BRUCE
What was it you wanted to talk to me
about?
SELINA
Your collection.
I'd love to see it.
I
mean, everyone says you've got a
fabulous --
She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself.
She toys
demurely with her equipment.
She looks up at BRUCE and
switches tactics -- going for the direct approach.
BRUCE
braces himself...
SELINA (cont.)
Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you
again.
Does she know you're here --
Vicki?
BRUCE
(shrugging)
No.
SELINA
It must be strange.
Having all that
power, and money -- never really knowing
if that's what people are attracted to.
BRUCE
What are you attracted to?
SELINA
I think you're a little bit nuts.
(beat)
I think you're a little -- bored with your
life.
Having everything you want.
No
variety, no...danger.
And every once in a
while you need to take a risk.
Shake it
all up.
BRUCE
How?
SELINA
Maybe by...coming here today.
She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips.
She's
letting him have it with both barrels.
SELINA (cont.)
That's one thing I can give you, Bruce --
danger -- a little something you can't get
at home.
BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible.
He moves
forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly
closer...
...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE.
She backs off in shock as he
covers his face.
His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING.
She rushes over --
SELINA
Are you okay?
BRUCE
Is there a cat in here?
Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW
-- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg.
He brushes the
animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms.
BRUCE sniffles
uncontrollably.
BRUCE (cont.)
Get it away!
She drops the cat, which scampers off.
BRUCE rubs his eyes.
SELINA
Poor thing.
You're allergic!
BRUCE
Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid...
(snorting and weeping)
Look, I'd better get some fresh air.
Maybe another time, okay...
He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him.
He's gone,
but she knows she's left a dent in his armor.
She smiles in
bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS.
The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe
building.
FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and
the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the
windshield.
They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of
similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS.
Just part of the
fleet...
The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office.
The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy
getaway.
The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX --
sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at
arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents.
Satisfied, he slams it shut.
He reaches into his top drawer
for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY.
PROVOST
Open this in an hour.
Phone my wife and
tell her where to meet me.
(to the GUARDS; edgily)
No trouble on the way, I take it?
LEAD GUARD
No sir, Mr. Provost.
We came straight
from the bank vault.
GUARD II
'Copter should be just touching down.
We'll have you safely out of here in no
time.
PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an
elevator bank.
The other GUARDS head for a stairwell.
GUARD II
We'll check the stairs.
See you on the
roof.
The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST
pulls a key from his pocket instead:
PROVOST
No -- my private elevator.
It's safer.
shooting DOWN on the car as it rises.
The shaft above it is
filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like,
swooping and gliding among the gears and cables...
SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up
button and the car begins to rise.
Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO
OUT.
The car stops with a lurch.
PROVOST
What is it??
What's happening??
Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud
POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire...
PITCH BLACK.
Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue
from the darkness.
An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the
emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a
corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed
spastic.
The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points
up at the LIGHT:
GUARD
There.
Mr. Provost.
See?
The
generator's kicked in.
It's just an
electrical problem.
PROVOST is only marginally consoled.
They hear a strange
TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them...
PROVOST starts babbling again.
The GUARD slaps him across the
face.
But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well.
He
stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on
the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move.
GUARD
There.
See?
It's moving.
We're fine.
PROVOST
It's going down.
We're going DOWN!!!
The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR.
They're patiently riding it down as it descends...
The car stops again.
PROVOST is totally losing it.
The
exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM.
GUARD
Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look
through the trap door.
But I need you to
help me.
Okay?
You have to help.
PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself.
The GUARD
looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car.
He can't
reach it...
He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist
-- and STANDS on it.
Still short.
Unholstering his gun and
using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door.
He
JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the
panel slightly.
More TWITTERING.
PROVOST and the guard look up through the
tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.
GUARD
Probably just some bird that's gotten in
the shaft.
Now calm down.
You'll have to
give me a boost.
The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box.
PROVOST gives him a
boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap
door.
GUARD (cont.)
Okay, help me out...steady...
PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and
tries to hoist him upward.
From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the
GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door.
Now
his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls
himself upward.
He peers around.
His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight
-- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front
of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face...
The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling.
PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees.
All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and
his legs KICK WILDLY.
Still PROVOST struggles to hang on --
even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome...
Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much.
PROVOST
trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his
ass in a corner of the car.
The GUARD tumbles in a heap to
the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond
recognition, his eyes gone altogether.
PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS.
He peers at the open
trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and
SHRIEKS AGAIN.
The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings.
He stares at it.
It rings
again.
Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage,
PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver.
PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
Sixteenth floor.
Linens, housewares,
ladies' lingerie!
PROVOST
W-who is this??
NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all
driverless.
FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical
equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been
LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's
private elevator, the doors to which are still closed.
The
PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.
PENGUIN
Mr. Provost?
If you want to get out of
that car alive, I suggest you follow my
instructions to the letter.
As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on
the concrete nearby, DEAD.
A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been
lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper
production staff from the VAN POOL.
They're trapped on the
other side.
BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door...
PENGUIN (cont.)
SHUT UP IN THERE.
(calmly; into phone)
You should see a cord hanging just behind
you.
PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned
CORD descending through the trap door.
PROVOST
Yes -- yes, I see it --
PENGUIN (V.O; filter)
Tie the cord to the handle of your box.
PROVOST lets the phone drop.
He grits his teeth, but hastens
to obey.
As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the
box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him
into a panic.
Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.
PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
When you're done, I want you to give two
sharp yanks on the cord.
Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it
twice.
PROVOST
Who are you??
Why are you doing this??
Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and
BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear.
FRICK climbs
into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine.
PENGUIN
Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call
me an irate reader.
And to be perfectly
frank -- I'm doing this because I hate
Garfield.
Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the
mouthpiece of the phone.
A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver.
All at once, the
elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging
themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined
space.
PROVOST is screaming like a madman.
The birds are in his
hair, his face -- everywhere.
He fights his way over to the
panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy...
All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD.
It's as if the floor
has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL.
PENGUIN
Going down!
He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from
the ELEVATOR DOORS.
The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets
uncontrollably downward.
A steady stream ot BIRDS are making
a quick exit from the trap door in the roof...
The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the
dormer that leads to the roof.
She pries open a pair of
ELEVATOR DOORS...
...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making
for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above.
She reaches
inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it
in.
She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at
her trophy.
It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like
the first two.
An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down,
RATTLES THE SHAFT...
She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the
roof.
HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour
in through the broken window.
WOMEN lined up for a FREE
MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their
hairdos.
FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in
the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door.
Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all
the ruckus --
-- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining
fast.
Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his
UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS
A TRIGGER.
ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges
itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR.
The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin
HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS.
A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS
bounce off in rapid succession.
CRACKS begin to spread across
the glass.
The COPS can't see where they're driving.
The car SWERVES
WILDLY.
And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE
WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW...
The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off
unmolested.
PENGUIN
Look at that, boys -- they do flock
together!!
CUT TO:
A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two
feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD.
He doesn't move.
PEDESTRIANS
are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and
peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the
street:
DRIVER
What the hell is this?
CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few
blocks over.
HORNS are honking.
A TRAFFIC COP marches
over --
TRAFFIC COP
Awright, what's the problem here?
(spotting BATMAN)
Jesus.
He tries to clear the crowd away.
A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is
forming around the prostrate BATMAN.
The COP blows his
whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN
rush up to join him.
They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.
The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body
armor.
Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters...
PATROLMAN
Good God.
Cowan -- get to the car --
radio the commissioner!!
By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection,
all surging forward to get a look.
More COPS are arriving to
beat them back.
TRAFFIC COP
Is he dead?
What do we do?
PATROLMAN
The mask.
Get the mask off.
They hunker down over BATMAN.
One of them tugs at his mask --
but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way.
He feels
around --
TRAFFIC COP
Some kinda seam here on the neck...
The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like
fastening under BATMAN's chin.
The instant it comes open --
-- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS
in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,
shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.
Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced.
One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.
On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN.
The
body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --
TRAFFIC COP
DON'T SHOOT, you idiot.
The crowd --
Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the
ONLOOKING COP's hand.
BATMAN is back among the living.
SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing
out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --
Fuck the crowd.
TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire
in absolute panic.
BATMAN slams backward into the delivery
truck and crumples to the ground.
As he falls, he grabs a
couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the
pavement.
Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading
through the intersection.
BATMAN emerges into the midst of
the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --
A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam,
drawn by all the confusion.
He rears the horse back, turns it
in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute
the incoming cars...
Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms.
He
looks down.
He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden
JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.
BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over
to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of
the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE.
He digs in his heels,
maneuvering through traffic...
Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night
patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to
the park.
RED BERET I
This is wack, man.
Nothing ever happens
around here anymore.
The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his
partner out of the way.
They tumble into a snowdrift as
BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and
gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process.
By now,
SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park...
SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP
CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the
park.
BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white
whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than
twenty yards away.
He turns the horse in a circle.
MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the
distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered
from the opposite side of the park.
It's going to be tough
getting out of here...
Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather,
GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet
apart.
He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI
and gets an inspiration.
He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans
the little frozen creek.
There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL
VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate.
This must
be where the boy vigilante holes up...
He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's
saddle and sends it off with a slap.
He pries the grate loose
and crawls inside.
A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in
the floor.
RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN
passes directly underneath.
A little farther back there's an
ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train
tracks below.
Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy
vigilante's stash.
The first contains tins of food, plus
various odds and ends.
The second's more in line with what he
needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING.
A TRAIN rumbles past underneath.
BRUCE removes his COWL and
sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get
him out of the park.
A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten
topcoat: perfect.
As he's pulling them out of the box, he
spies something extremely odd --
It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT
with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine
condition.
He removes it carefully from the box and holds it
up in front of him.
Stitched on the vest is a single initial,
"R," in a black circle.
He stares at the whole mystifying
ensemble in complete befuddlement...
The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING
NOISE.
Someone's in the tunnel with him.
He lowers the
costume abruptly --
-- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front
of him not three feet away.
The kid's just crawled up through
the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder
messing with his stuff:
DICK
It's MINE!
He lunges furiously at BRUCE.
The two of them tumble back
into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE --
TWO COPS scanning the park.
The CAPED HORSE charges past in
front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the
headlights.
From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in
the saddle.
The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn.
A moment later, he
SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the
squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen
ski cap, obviously one of the homeless.
A COP leans on the
horn and shouts out the window:
COP
Dumb son of a bitch!!
The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path.
The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse.
CUT TO:
A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table.
ALFRED, in robe
and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE
BANDAGE.
ALFRED
Commissioner Gordon called.
He wants to
install a full contingent of police guards
here at the manor -- in round-the-clock
shifts -- to protect you from Batman.
BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair.
His shirt
is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a
full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS.
BRUCE
Great.
What'd you tell him?
ALFRED
I told him that since you were Batman,
you'd require no protection from Batman.
BRUCE makes a face: how droll.
ALFRED tears off the tape with
a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF
PAIN.
BRUCE
Jesus, Alfred -- !!
ALFRED
In future, sir...I strongly advise against
trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.
BRUCE
It's just a few bruises.
ALFRED
One bruise, sir.
Which covers your entire
body.
BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly
fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's
bag.
BRUCE
I'm getting too old for this line of work.
(beat)
Cops placed me at the scene of the crime
-- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my
face --
ALFRED
I shouldn't worry overmuch.
I doubt the
two of you move in the same circles.
BRUCE
-- and I got the living shit knocked out
of me by a woman.
ALFRED
Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are
quite unbecoming.
In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side
(or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS
settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across
antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS
littering the carpet.
HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one
wall.
They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE
across the street...
HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT
A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping
watch on the roof of the brownstone.
He signals "all clear"
to his counterpart watching from the house opposite.
TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block,
munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone.
They
spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on
his way to the brownstone.
One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks
up his RADIO MIKE:
PLAINCLOTHESMAN
Mailman's coming.
MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside --
unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up.
They're in
for the long haul.
The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of
COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown
paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS.
They carry it
gingerly into the kitchen.
Into the midst of all this
bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON:
GORDON
Anything suspicious!
In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are
examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light
bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open.
COP
Nothing yet.
Christmas cards and bills.
He anxiously watches their progress.
A VOICE calls from the
kitchen.
BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.)
Commissioner -- ?
GORDON enters.
The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment
scattered all over the kitchen table.
They've slit the brown-
paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE
TIN.
BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT
It's a fruitcake.
He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look.
GORDON
...Have it analyzed.
A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying
a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES.
His WIFE and TWO KIDS are
behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an
extended vacation.
POLICEMAN
Mrs. Tiptree?
The car's here.
TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long
wordless moment.
Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's
sleeve.
LITTLE GIRL
I don't wanna go to Grandma's.
I wanna
stay here with Daddy.
MRS. TIPTREE
She's got a nice tree just like ours,
honey.
Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.
LITTLE GIRL
She's old.
She doesn't even have cable.
LITTLE BOY
What about our presents?
He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the
parlor.
TIPTREE
Don't worry.
I'll bring 'em up with me.
We'll open 'em when I get there.
TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids.
He CLUTCHES his wife's
hand.
GORDON
Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.
MRS. TIPTREE
Kids?
Tell your Daddy goodbye...
Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort
MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door.
TIPTREE pulls GORDON
aside.
TIPTREE
They'll be safe, won't they?
GORDON
As safe as we can make 'em.
(beat; sternly)
It would help if you could give us some
small hint what this is all about.
TIPTREE
I told you.
I...
TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes.
GORDON is
convinced he's holding something back.
GORDON
You have no idea what was in that box that
Provost had delivered from the bank.
TIPTREE shakes his head wearily.
GORDON glowers as he turns
to go.
GORDON (cont.)
All right, Mr. Tiptree.
Merry Christmas.
GORDON exits.
TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living
room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids
ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS.
One of the COPS tries to
pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move...
...until a PHONE RINGS.
Everyone jumps at once.
A TECHNICIAN
hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly,
then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver...
TIPTREE
Hello...?
VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER
Mr. Tiptree?
Andy here.
Listen -- we've
got a chance to grab a good-sized block of
Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an
eighth --
The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment.
TIPTREE
Not today, Andy.
Let's talk after New
Year's.
TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle
of the room.
The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment
as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff
jolt.
Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary
composing a LETTER.
He takes a long pull on a glass of
Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an
envelope.
He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a
.38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes
it to the envelope.
He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE.
A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK.
He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the
ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.
He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside,
onto the sill.
The bird, well-trained, struggles only
slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes
a FOLDED NOTE.
Scrawled across it is a handwritten message:
IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD
He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing.
CUT TO:
BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions.
A BANNER
HEAD-LINE shrieks:
BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER
Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square
J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy
He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall.
He gets up...
BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing
her patetented thing on ALFRED.
SELINA
English accents are so stimulating.
(beat)
You have the most beautiful silver hair!
ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR.
He's
about to break into a sweat.
He's eminently relieved when she
turns and sees --
SELINA (cont.)
Bruce!
BRUCE
Selina.
What are you doing here?
ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA
slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm.
She's on him like a
barnacle.
SELINA
I wanted to see your things, remember?
And I got tired of waiting for you to call
me back.
(gesturing toward ALFRED)
He's adorable.
How long have you had him?
BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory.
He glances
back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around
the corner.
BRUCE
You heard about Harry Provost.
SELINA
It's incredibly awful.
It got me a little
worried.
(sidling up closer)
I hate to think of something happening to
you.
BRUCE
Same here.
SELINA
It's odd, though.
Danger, the thought of
suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets
you sort of...aroused.
Don't you think?
BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her.
Everything gets her sort of
aroused.
SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and
exotic weapons.
She's like a kid in a toy shop.
SELINA
Bruce, this is incredible.
(indicating a suit of armor)
Malaysian -- ?
BRUCE
Not bad.
Sarawak warrior caste.
SELINA
It's like -- everything in here is another
little piece of your mind.
I was right
about you.
(turning to face him)
Promise, okay?
Promise you'll show me
every inch of this place.
PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer
printout.
He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at
a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the
keyboard.
ALFRED
The police have no files whatsoever on
Selina Kyle.
BRUCE
(abstractedly)
London...Cairo...Belgium...
ALFRED
What exactly are you --
BRUCE
Her credit card records.
(looking up)
Every major art theft in the last five
years -- she's been on the scene or close
to it.
ALFRED
You mean she's some sort of -- collector?
A...cat burglar, or --
BRUCE
Could be.
Museum curator, authenticator
-- she's got the perfect cover for it.
(beat)
What would she want with that stupid
raven?
ALFRED
Raven, sir?
BRUCE
That's what the Catwoman took from
Provost.
A little raven statuette, about
so big...
(shaking his head)
But it couldn't have been that valuable.
He continues to scan the screen.
ALFRED is suddenly lost in
thought.
ALFRED
How very odd.
(long pause)
I'm sure it's nothing, but --
BRUCE
What, Alfred?
ALFRED
Your father had a raven, sir.
A small
statue of the very sort you describe.
It
used to sit on his desk.
This piques BRUCE's interest.
He swivels around in his chair
and stares directly up at ALFRED.
BRUCE
What happened to it?
ALFRED
After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree
came to the house and asked if he could
have it.
As a keepsake.
I saw no harm...
(shrugging)
That was thirty years ago.
BRUCE
Wait a minute.
Mr. Tiptree?
ALFRED
George Tiptree.
Your friend Elliott's
father.
CUT TO:
TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed.
It's empty
-- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's
stuffing inside it.
His head turns suddenly at the sound of
the doorbell...
TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister
into the ENTRYWAY below.
Standing there is an unexpected
visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a
battery of COPS pat him down.
BRUCE
What are you looking for -- Batarangs?
TIPTREE
Bruce!
Come on up.
(to the COPS)
I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.
The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs.
TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him.
BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX.
BRUCE
I brought you a Christmas present.
Sorry
about the wrapping -- the police made me
open it.
TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE
CLASP.
He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of
bewilderment and gratitude.
BRUCE nods for him to try it on,
and he obliges...
TIPTREE
...I'm afraid I don't have anything for
you.
BRUCE
I think you may have something that
belonged to my father.
TIPTREE
-- You know?
He stares at BRUCE, astonished.
His head sinks into his
hands.
TIPTREE (cont.)
It'll all be over tomorrow.
One way or
another, it'll all be over.
(looking up; despondent)
I've decided, Bruce.
I'm gonna give him
the last two ravens.
He's already got the
others.
BRUCE
What are you talking about?
Who?
TIPTREE
Batman.
I don't know how he found out,
but --
TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a
drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands.
BRUCE
It's time you told me what's going on
here.
TIPTREE
Didn't you ever wonder where it came from,
Bruce?
All the privilege, all the power
...all the money?
(beat)
The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce.
The key to an incredibly vast fortune.
BRUCE
Whose fortune?
TIPTREE
Gotham City's.
FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham.
A massive
EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and
total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming,
POLICE rushing to the scene...
TIPTREE
In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was
looted.
It was a fantastic operation --
perfect military precision.
The robbers
made off with milllons in gold and silver
bullion...
A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens
around a corner.
Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a
GATLING GUN into the crowd.
POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to
the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the
wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite
direction.
FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth,
arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS
-- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER
WAYNE.
TIPTREE (V.O.)
The city was going under.
Bankrupt...
until five rich men stepped in to bail it
out.
In exchange they took the land
rights, the mineral rights, the service
contracts --
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE
BRUCE
The Five Families.
TIPTREE
Our ancestors.
They bought Gotham City --
carved it up and ran it into the ground.
In five years they were rich beyond
imagining.
(pause)
We've just been following in their
footsteps.
And in all this time no one's
ever suspected --
BRUCE
-- that they were the ones behind the
robbery?
FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne
Manor, raising a celebratory toast.
CAMERA PANS OVER to a
nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES.
TIPTREE (O.S.)
They had five ravens made.
Five ravens
which -- combined -- would reveal the
location of the treasure they'd stolen.
(beat)
But they never touched it.
They never
needed to.
It's still there to this day.
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE
TIPTREE
The ravens, and the secret -- have been
passed down through generations.
Father
to son...
(shaking his head)
Your father -- died before he could tell
you.
BRUCE
So they stole his piece of the puzzle.
TIPTREE
Yeah.
I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going
to hand it over.
He's right, you know.
We've all been feeding -- feeding on the
soul of Gotham...
BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced.
There's one part of the
story that doesn't quite add up.
BRUCE (cont.)
I don't believe you, Elliott.
My father
was a decent man -- an honorable man.
He
would never have taken part in a scheme
like this.
TIPTREE
It wasn't his doing, Bruce.
It was --
BRUCE
That doesn't matter.
If he knew that his
fortune was based on a crime -- a crime
against the city...
(violently)
Reputation or not, he would've tried to --
TIPTREE
Christ, Bruce!
Do you want me to spell it
out for you?!?
BRUCE backs off.
An awful shiver of anticipation runs down
his spine.
TIPTREE (cont.)
He was a decent man.
He was an honorable
man.
That's why they had him killed.
CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a
SERIES OF SHOTS
Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a
MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace.
THOMAS WAYNE
lunging at him.
The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS.
PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk.
A second
bullet felling his MOTHER --
-- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN
and GRIEF --
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
-- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the
adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years
later.
Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as
TIPTREE finishes his tale.
TIPTREE
They killed him...to protect their secret
...and now the bill's come due.
Now the
bill's come due.
CUT TO:
BRUCE lies motionless on his bed.
Scattered about him are
SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS
which describe the murder of his parents.
Disoriented, he
gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no
longer seem quite so familiar...
He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at
the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is
crushing him down.
Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS.
He makes no
move to answer it.
VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee.
ALFRED, who's
in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone.
ALFRED
Thank you, yes, everything's fine.
I'll
expect your next call in an hour.
(hanging up; to VICKI)
The police are becoming an awful nuisance.
VICKI
I feel so awful for him, Alfred.
There
must be something we can do.
ALFRED
I realized long ago -- that there are
places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one
will ever penetrate --
or share.
(pause)
He loves you, Miss Vale.
But in certain
ways he will always be alone.
BRUCE (O.S.)
...Thanks for the testimonial.
ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring
at him.
He starts to say something, but thinks better of it.
He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down
across from VICKI.
She extends a hand and he takes it --
making a visible effort to hold himself together.
BRUCE
Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous
with 'Batman.'
I think Batman ought to be
there when it happens.
ALFRED
I see, sir.
When shall we expect you
back?
BRUCE
Get your cap.
You're driving.
It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently
downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE.
The lights are on
in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching
TV.
CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness.
TIPTREE kneels
beside the tree and digs around among the packages.
He pulls
out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed "TO DADDY -- FROM
SANTA."
With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the
package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN
STATUETTES.
He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then
slinks into the hallway...
The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown
Christmas special on a portable TV.
One of them glances out
the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the
brownstone, SUITCASE in hand...
STAKEOUT COP I
Shit -- that's Tiptree!!
The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE.
A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS
come racing down the stairs.
The COPS trip over his open
violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor.
They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE
TURNSTILE --
-- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling
down a stairway which leads to the train platform below.
TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN.
The doors slide shut
behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as
he rolls off.
COP
We've gotta get back to the radio.
TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively.
Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice
in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the
sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing.
Derelicts,
prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well-
heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his
suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor...
An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car.
It's a
DEAFMUTE.
He shambles down the aisle passing out little white
CARDS.
One side is a guide to International Sign Language.
The other reads:
DEAF AND DUMB
PLEASE HELP -- $1.00
TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling,
shining the DEAFMUTE on.
A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type,
stuffs a buck in his tin cup.
He reaches TIPTREE and extends
a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact --
-- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face.
Now TIPTREE looks up.
THIS CARD bears a personalized message:
GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION
B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW
TIPTREE's eyes widen.
The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK --
glowers down and holds out his cup.
TIPTREE digs in his
pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands
it over anyway.
Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next
car.
TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card.
He fidgets
with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier...
TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE.
A small BLIP
moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen.
BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently.
ALFRED's up front, at the wheel.
BRUCE
According to this, he's directly below us.
ALFRED
The subway, sir?
BRUCE
Yeah.
Take a right.
It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham.
TIPTREE
emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS
thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as
they scan the crowd.
Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the
nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold
the SUITCASE out of view.
TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to
close.
He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the
doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT.
He stands
there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the
train lurches forward...
False alarm.
The train stops, and the doors hiss open again.
TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations.
As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful
STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious
suitcase.
He sits there panting...
Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car.
TIPTREE does a
take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line!
Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin --
FRACK...
WIPE TO:
Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE
debarks at a deserted local stop.
The station is EMPTY except
for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a
WOMAN in a long fur coat.
TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell,
STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor.
There's something
familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed
hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face.
It is, of course, SELINA...
TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting
further instructions.
They aren't long in coming.
A BLACK
MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform,
and STRUTS in front of him.
MYNAH
FOLLOW ME.
AWWWKK!
FOLLOW ME.
The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE
TUNNEL.
TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief.
Then the bird
CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of
the tunnel:
MYNAH (O.S.)
FOLLOW ME.
AWWWKK!
TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping
awkwardly to the tracks below.
Suitcase in hand, he begins to
walk...
ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer.
BRUCE
He's slowed down.
Looks like he's under
the park.
ALFRED
How do you propose to get down there, sir?
We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a
token.
BRUCE
I know another way in.
(beat)
Step on it.
They're down there waiting
for him.
ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past
the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse...
A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen.
When it passes,
we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express
tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with
each step.
It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the
only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot
intervals.
He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly
switches to the local tracks.
The train rumbles past with a
deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his
surroundings.
TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the
tunnel...
...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a
small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE.
They've set up camp down
here in the tunnels, away from the elements.
Surrounded by
bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap
wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with
the suitcase who's invaded their domain.
TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening
down the tunnel.
The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with
one exception.
A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty
topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively
as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows.
His face is familiar.
It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the
park.
In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be
working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible.
When he
comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of
the bird's shrill voice to guide him:
MYNAH
AWWRRK!
FOLLOW ME.
TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness.
He trips on
the tracks and drops the suitcase.
As he's getting to his
feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE...
VOICE
STOP THERE.
The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches
on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE.
TIPTREE COWERS and
SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands
before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA.
TIPTREE
I've cooperated.
I've done everything you
said.
PENGUIN
Open the case.
TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase.
A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness.
PENGUIN (cont.)
...Two ravens?
TIPTREE
The other one is Bruce Wayne's.
(trembling)
He doesn't know anything about this.
You've got what you want.
There's no need
to --
PENGUIN
Thank you, Mr. Tiptree.
You may go.
TIPTREE stands.
He backs away from the suitcase warily.
TIPTREE
My family.
You won't --
PENGUIN
We'll certainly take your unexpected
generosity into consideration.
TIPTREE
We -- ?!?
(shielding his eyes)
You're not Batman.
PENGUIN
No.
I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman.
Now move out.
TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA,
silhouetted in the flashlight beam.
The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY
as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light
down --
-- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel
cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING
as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath.
looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross-
girder.
He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat,
WHIRLS SUDDENLY --
-- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS
at the PENGUIN.
The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella --
which happens to be a bulletproof job.
The PENGUIN lifts his
brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft --
-- and TIPTREE staggers backward.
SHOT IN THE CHEST.
He
spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the
ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of
sparks.
The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the
tracks.
The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for
signs of life.
CATWOMAN
That idiot.
Another six feet --
PENGUIN
So sorry to spoil your fun.
-- He brought
two ravens.
We've got a complete set!
CATWOMAN
What??
PENGUIN
Yeah!
They're in the suitcase --
An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel.
They see the lights of a
TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're
standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across.
The
PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track,
where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag
TIPTREE out of the train's path...
CATWOMAN
GIVE ME A HAND!
They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the
train arrives.
They stand against the outer wall, waiting for
the train to pass...
...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante --
standing on the inner track directly across from them.
HOLDING THE SUITCASE.
The kid takes off like a shot.
The
CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter
disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK.
The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress.
He looks back
over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has
fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast.
PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
watching in the light from the train as the two costumed
figures grapple in the distance.
He races back toward the
scene of the melee...
...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for
blow.
He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook,
and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding.
She lifts a
hand: no mas...
He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track.
Before
he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN
approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the
last one.
He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out
of its path...
...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN
comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite
direction!
Now he's got trains approaching on either side,
and there's no place to go --
The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet.
He LUNGES at
her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer
tunnel wall.
The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and
the CATWOMAN from view.
The CENTER train is bearing down
fast.
A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches
the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on
the innermost LOCAL TRACK.
He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite
directions.
He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead...
BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove --
there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the
passing TRAIN.
She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and
CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT.
HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT.
As they struggle,
she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER...
It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved
him when he fell off the roof.
But this time the results are
altogether different.
He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS
CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF
THE TUNNEL.
His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against
the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the
rearmost car --
-- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED
OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train!
He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively
to see what's become of BATMAN.
Finally the center train
passes --
-- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE --
smiling at him -- advancing menacingly.
DICK TURNS TO RUN...
A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps
to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of
the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.
The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat.
The CATWOMAN
snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him.
She
peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated...
CATWOMAN
God.
Did you see him? Isn't he hot?
PENGUIN
Haven't you got anything else to think
about?
(mopping sweat from his brow)
I'm hot.
That was exhausting.
CATWOMAN
No pain, no gain!
-- Suck it up.
We're
not out of here yet.
She sprints off down the tracks.
SQUAWKING, he waddles along
behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him...
As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back --
past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding
heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF
TUNNELS --
-- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he
staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody.
He scans
the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his
gaze falls on DICK.
He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his
head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all
around him...
DISSOLVE TO:
A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome.
We TILT
DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie
sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT.
The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the
atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a
point directly under the dome.
There, encased in a plexiglass
case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City
Hall was erected.
He shouts up:
PENGUIN
LETS DO IT!
The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony.
Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical
interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the
pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a
bronze bust.
The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families...
The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly.
She removes the FIVE
RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way
around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed
bases.
She follows along behind them, replacing each bust
with a RAVEN.
When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up:
PENGUIN
Now.
Give each raven a quarter-turn.
His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its
recessed socket, in quick succession...
The moment of maximum tension.
He stands there frothing at
the mouth with anticipation.
SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing
happens.
CATWOMAN
What happens now?
PENGUIN
I don't know.
That's all...!
He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him
from above.
He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen
next.
Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the
floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING,
flapping his arms like wings.
PENGUIN (cont.)
We've been TRICKED!
It's a HOAX!
It's
a --
He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK.
Somewhere
behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind.
He spins
and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass
case...
The city model is TREMBLING slightly.
As he watches, the DOME
of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model
city -- POPS OFF on a hinge.
A METAL STRONGBOX rises into
view...
The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal
box.
The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass
case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to
get at the box.
FRICK
That's the treasure?
CATWOMAN
No.
It's a map...
She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER.
The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls
through, landing atop Gotham City.
He snatches at the
strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a
colossus.
He's climbing down off the tabletop when the
CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him.
He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off
the box.
He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a
MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS.
The CATWOMAN creeps
over to his side:
PENGUIN
Bruce Wayne.
So he doesn't know a thing
about the treasure, eh...?
(handing her the map)
Look at this.
It's right under Wayne
Manor.
It's been there all along!
Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS.
They show
progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES --
an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION...
PENGUIN (cont.)
Looks like some kind of cave.
FADE THROUGH TO:
TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK.
He lies unconscious in a big soft
frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp
cloth; he moans slightly...
His eyes snap open suddenly.
He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a
yelp.
VICKI
No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're
hurt.
He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway.
His
shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling.
The pajamas he's
wearing are three sizes too large.
He paces about, staring at
his unfamiliar surroundings.
VICKI (cont.)
It's all right.
You're safe.
You can
stay here as long as you need to.
DICK
I don't belong here.
You can't keep me
here.
Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades,
looks out at the grounds.
VICKI
It's "Dick", isn't it?
Or do you prefer
"Richard"?
He stares at her as if she's nuts.
VICKI opens a closet door:
all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including
the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the "R" insigne on the
breast.
VICKI
"R" -- for Richard, right?
See, all your
things are here...
(staring at the costume)
What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?
DICK
It's none of your business.
What is this,
some kind of home?
VICKI
No, not that kind.
There's a swimming
pool -- tennis court -- you can have
anything you want.
DICK
Tennis court?!
-- Lady, you're rich.
How
the hell would you know what I want?
VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder.
He bats it
away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in
agitation --
DICK
I'm not staying.
You can't make me --
-- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him.
BRUCE
I can make you.
DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized
him.
The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh.
I'm
in Batman's house.
BRUCE (cont.)
Come on.
Wanna go at it?
(no response)
Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my
guest -- and long as you're here you might
as well enjoy it.
ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a
bedside table.
DICK edges toward it and sits down.
He waits
for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE
all the while.
BRUCE (cont.)
Will you two be okay in here?
VICKI nods yes.
BRUCE backs out of the room.
BRUCE pulls the door shut.
ALFRED follows him down the hall.
ALFRED
What do you propose to do with him, sir?
Keep him in the room for the rest of his
life?
BRUCE
I don't know, Alfred.
I've got other
stuff to worry about.
ALFRED
The child is hurt, sir.
At the very least
we should attempt to locate his parents.
BRUCE
He hasn't got any parents.
ALFRED
How do you know that, sir?
BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze.
BRUCE
...I know.
The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway.
ALFRED picks up a hallway extension.
He covers the
mouthpiece:
ALFRED
Sir -- it's Miss Kyle.
BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call.
ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room.
A
SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a
phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over
her.
SELINA
Well!
Tall, dark and handsome.
Are we
still on for tonight?
He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED.
On his
look we
DISSOLVE TO:
Christmas carols playing.
VICKI's got DICK helping her trim
the tree.
BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA.
ALFRED
Is this necessary, sir?
After all...it is
Christmas eve.
BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT.
He empties the contents
of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE
CAPSULES.
He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits
them in his jacket pocket.
BRUCE
Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a
cat.
ALFRED
I don't like to see you going out on a
date...unprotected, sir.
BRUCE
She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for
me.
(turning to go)
It's the only way, Alfred.
I've got to
take her out tonight.
DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the
bottom of the stairs.
The two of them exchange a few brief
words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly
sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door.
VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of
cheer as DICK turns discreetly away.
This is one weird
household he's landed in...
SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front
of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in
her own reflection.
She's looking especially sultry tonight
in a glittering low-cut gown.
She lowers one shoulder strap
and strikes a pose in the mirror: better.
She runs a hand
through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look.
The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to
answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which
means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand.
BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in.
She pulls
up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly:
SELINA
You're early.
I'm afraid I'm not quite
dressed.
BRUCE enters and takes a long look around.
It's a big open
loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts.
The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS.
The
finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised
platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it,
yowling at BRUCE.
SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out.
SELINA (cont.)
If you're looking for my bondage gear,
it's at the cleaners.
BRUCE
Christmas eve.
No tree?
SELINA
No presents.
I've been a bad girl this
year.
BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby
wet bar.
BRUCE
I'm surprised you kept this date.
I
thought you would've lost interest by now.
SELINA
What makes you say that?
BRUCE
You've got what you want, don't you?
SELINA
I do now.
(smiling)
We've had this date for a long, long time.
With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in
to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss.
But BRUCE seems
strangely unresponsive.
She breaks free and gives him a funny
look.
BRUCE
How much is it going to cost me?
SELINA
What?
BRUCE
...To get the ravens back.
He watches her closely for a reaction.
SELINA's shocked, but
she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion.
SELINA
You're the oddest man I've ever met.
(moving in on him)
Let's talk later, Bruce.
I've got kind of
a short fuse...
BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a
crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek.
She works her way
downward, kissing him around his neck and throat...
HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket.
He withdraws a tiny
GLASSINE CAPSULE.
But before he can use it --
He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away.
His free hand goes
to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from
between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS.
She's bitten him...
Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and
massages it gently with one hand.
SELINA
Did I hurt you?
Just relax -- you'll
start to enjoy it.
BRUCE pulls away again.
His eyes are strangely glazed.
He
tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen.
SELINA (cont.)
Bruce, you look faint.
It must be the
cats.
BRUCE stands suddenly.
It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo
nightmare.
His legs give way beneath him and he topples to
the floor, INERT.
His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls
out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem
to work.
SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form --
purring and stretching...
BRUCE'S POV
A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory
smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus.
BRUCE
What di-- what did you d--
She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright
red.
SELINA
I guess I've...gotten under your skin.
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes
SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG.
He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually
going slack.
The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and
stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING...
DISSOLVE TO:
ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's
boys.
ALFRED
Everything's fine, thank you.
We'll talk
in an hour.
Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE.
She's curled up on
the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious
glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven
o'clock.
DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall.
He's got
all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a
window and throws the bundle outside.
There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from
the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make
it.
He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS.
A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her
Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and
FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious
and stone limp.
The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates
of Wayne Manor.
PENGUIN
Try his mag card.
FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED
CAPSULES.
FRICK
Look at this.
He's a pillhead.
Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an
electronic device at the edge of the drive.
The gates
magically part.
There's a large VAN just behind the car --
driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS.
Both vehicles
pull in before the gates slide shut.
VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen
announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival.
She heaves a huge
sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open.
She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up.
VICKI
Ohh.
Am I glad to --
To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the
floor, flat as a board.
VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters,
throwing his arms wide.
PENGUIN
MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!!
VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE.
VICKI
What did you do to him??
SELINA gives her a catty little smile.
SELINA
First-time jitters, I guess.
Everything
was going great, and then...he just went
limp as a noodle.
Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the
entry hall, pulling a robe around him.
He freezes in his
tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front
parlor, holding a gun to her head.
PENGUIN
You'd be the butler.
Why don't you come
on down and attend to your guests?
ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him.
He
marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate
form.
ALFRED
Mr. Wayne.
Is he -- ?
PENGUIN
You know how it is.
Some guys just can't
hold their egg nog.
The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's
already assembled.
FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa
just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE
inside.
PENGUIN
I should explain the occasion of our
visit.
There's a treasure underneath this
house -- and I don't plan to leave until
you tell me how to find it.
Now who's
going to talk -- Miss Vale?
VICKI
I don't know what you're talking about.
PENGUIN
The cave.
Under the house.
How do I get
there?
The PENGUIN gestures.
FRICK holds the gun to her head.
VICKI (cont.)
I don't know!
I swear, I would tell
you --
PENGUIN
(turning to ALFRED)
Then maybe you'd like to tell me.
ALFRED
You're no more than a common thief.
PENGUIN
Wrong, you old idiot.
I happen to be a
very uncommon thief.
(beat)
Are you going to tell me, or does Miss
Vale get an early present this year?
FRICK cocks the gun.
VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans
the room, weighing his options.
Trembling, he shuts his
eyes --
ALFRED
I...don't...know...
PENGUIN
Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the
tree.
FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger.
VICKI winces.
ALFRED
starts to blurt something out.
But a split-second before he
can speak --
SELINA
Wait!
(crossing over to VICKI)
We don't know how to get down there yet.
We may need her when Bruce wakes up.
The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off.
ALFRED and VICKI heave
simultaneous sighs of relief.
He throws her a shamefaced look
-- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made
the right play.
SELINA (cont.)
Besides -- I want this one for myself.
So
pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new
face for Christmas.
The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on
the floor.
He turns to FRICK and FRACK.
PENGUIN
Why don't you two tie up our host?
ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the
premises.
FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back
parlor which opens off the room they're in.
They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone
cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands
and feet.
Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about
the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive
objects.
PENGUIN
It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it?
Just the sort of setting in which I've
always imagined myself.
ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of
disgust.
PENGUIN (cont.)
I see.
You think I'm vulgar.
You think
I'm...nouveau.
ALFRED
I think you're a dirty little man with
a --
The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a
tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES
crashing to the floor.
He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK
reappear.
PENGUIN
See, boys, that's old money talking.
After a while, they actually start to
believe they've earned all this.
(smirking)
I don't mind.
Someday I'll be old money
too -- when the statute of limitations
runs out.
SELINA (O.S.)
Hey!
-- Guess what I just found.
Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see
SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of...
SELINA (cont.)
Christmas cookies!
The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from
cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet.
SELINA
graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with
limited enthusiasm.
PENGUIN
Let's spread out and see what we can find.
(to FRICK and FRACK)
You two -- keep an eye on our friends
here.
Give me a yell the minute Wayne
comes to.
FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front
parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through
the house.
CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE --
-- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands
STRUGGLING against his bonds.
SERIES OF SHOTS
QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as
they search for the entrance to the cave.
SELINA and the
PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for
secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE
APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out
of frames, etc.
Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the
grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the
parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on
ALFRED and VICKI.
CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a
LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels.
Suddenly, an
ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and
fumbles for the lock --
FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring
from the kitchen.
VICKI looks at ALFRED...
FRICK
Better check it out.
FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and
down a long hall to the kitchen.
He tosses a glance back at
VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself.
FRICK (cont.)
What is it?
What's going on??
VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor.
DICK GRAYSON has
sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at
BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener.
Both of them stiffen
simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a
clear view of DICK and BRUCE.
FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the
SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates.
A RED LIGHT is
blinking, indicating DICK's break-in.
FRACK throws switches
frantically, trying to kill the sound.
Finally he succeeds --
and SHOUTS:
FRACK
Some kind of security system --
DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects
of the drug, isn't much use.
He tries to get off the sofa and
crumples in a heap.
DICK
Can you move, man?
BRUCE
Library -- got to get me to the library --
DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door
opening onto the hallway.
They're just about to step outside
when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen.
-- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch
the situation develop.
FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the
moment.
By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway:
PENGUIN
What is that ungodly racket?
FRACK
A security alarm.
It went off in the
kitchen.
PENGUIN
My God!
Is someone in here?
He struts over to huddle with his cronies.
BRUCE and DICK are
still poised in the doorway.
It looks bad...
ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK
bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway.
He pats VICKI's
knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat --
-- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun.
A moment
of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time
to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and
vanish --
-- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for
long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor.
FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point-
blank range.
VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.
The room's a mess, books all over the floor.
The groggy BRUCE
props himself up against his desk.
He manages to pull the
bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret
switch.
He's CRYING.
BRUCE
Alfred...
DICK
I'll go back.
BRUCE
I can't...get down there...without you.
DICK turns.
To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is
swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE.
We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a
superficial wound to the arm.
VICKI is on her knees beside
him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt.
PENGUIN
What an extraordinarily stupid thing to
do.
VICKI
SHUT UP.
Help me with him.
The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give
VICKI a hand without him.
They carry him into the parlor, lay
him out on the sofa.
VICKI reaches into her purse for a
handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls
FRACK aside.
PENGUIN
You and I had better check the ground
floor and see what's going on.
Mr. Frick
-- do you think you'll be able to manage
this pair?
FRICK
Yes sir.
PENGUIN
Oh, good.
That does relieve my mind --
He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT
CORDS on the love seat.
The blood drains out of his face.
PENGUIN (cont.)
Where's Wayne???
DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around
him in pure, unalloyed amazement.
BRUCE is fumbling with a
packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of
pills and swallows them dry.
Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping
switches.
They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind
BRUCE and looks on, dazzled.
INSERT - MONITOR
The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his
two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors.
PENGUIN
Check the grounds!
The shape he's in, he
can't have gotten far.
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and
waits.
The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside.
He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels
from outside.
It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in
here...
DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne
Manor.
BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down
below.
BRUCE
-- as soon as he gets to the East wing.
Wait for my signal.
You know what to do.
DICK nods yes and bolts off.
VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint.
With the
commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy-
fingered.
Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- "SANTA
BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME."
FRICK turns and stares at it in
confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls --
-- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the
loudspeakers.
BRUCE (O.S.; filter)
VICKI!
RUN!
NOW!
She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall.
FRICK turns and takes aim --
-- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of
nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face!
The shot goes wild and
the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it
over...
VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall.
HUGE OAKEN SLIDING
DOORS are already slamming shut behind her.
The same thing is
happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is
sealing itself off!
DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on
the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth.
Before
FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the
back of the skull with a fireplace poker.
He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to
ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination
from the sofa.
DICK
Here.
You might need it.
ALFRED
Thank you, Master Dick.
And...bravo.
VICKI has made it to the wall phone.
She can't seem to get a
dial tone --
VOICE FROM BEHIND
Do you really think we're that stupid?
VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is
SELINA's.
SELINA (cont.)
I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!
With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out.
VICKI
turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before
she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around
her wrist, jerking the knife loose.
SELINA tugs on the other
end, reeling her closer.
SELINA
You know, I've got a great recipe for
Sliced Bitch --
VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and
throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island.
While
they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to
bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of
the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her
claws.
VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to
block the blow: CLANG.
VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA
with knives and appliances.
It buys her enough time to make
for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her.
Another
downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK
into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in
the wood.
VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.
SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI.
SELINA
I love a good old-fashioned catfight --
but this is pissing me off.
VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED
COCKTAIL CART before her.
It SLAMS full-force into SELINA,
who lands on her back on the great long dining table.
VICKI
is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up.
VICKI races up the stairs.
She has a good lead, but SELINA
makes up the difference in a hurry.
She takes the stairway in
three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks
down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her
and LOCKING IT.
SELINA
HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty
kitty...
She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.
SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door
behind her.
VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading
to a balcony, but it's too long a drop.
She stands there
paralyzed as SELINA advances.
SELINA
So this is where you earn your keep.
She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves
her roughly back onto the bed.
VICKI flails wildly as SELINA
kneels atop her...
SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly
section of bra --
SELINA
Mmm!
Frederick's of Gotham?
She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT
DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's
belly.
Now VICKI just loses it.
She begins to SHRIEK
uncontrollably.
SELINA
Not so loud, honey!
The neighbors'll get
the wrong idea.
(laughing)
Santa's coming.
Time for all good girls
to go to sleep...
She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's
neck.
But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes
wide-eyed and shuts up.
A BLACK SHADOW falls across the
moonlit bed.
SELINA tenses --
-- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair --
BATMAN
Miss me, "Angel"?
He yanks her bodily off the bed.
Before she knows what's
happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT.
She flies into
the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges.
BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself
up.
SELINA
Okay -- let's do it, huh?
You and me...
all the way this time.
She HISSES and jumps him.
They grapple -- a quick flurry of
fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long
stairway.
She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner.
BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time...
VICKI rushes out of the bedroom.
She looks down the hall and
sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN --
slamming into the wall opposite.
He slumps to the carpet, out
cold.
A moment later DICK strolls out.
VICKI rushes to his side --
VICKI
Come on.
We'll be safe in the cave.
BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is
slightly ajar.
He pushes it in cautiously...
...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing
down mere inches from his face.
It's the PENGUIN wielding the
ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him.
But then --
-- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing
on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again.
It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a
good workout in the next thirty seconds.
BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall
behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into
SELINA's ribs.
It's a crippling blow; she flies backward,
knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES,
knocking over another -- and another --
-- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over,
domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the
cowering PENGUIN.
SELINA is badly hurt now.
She makes it out of a rear door to
the armory.
BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems
to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA.
SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around
enough to dig himself out.
As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the
LIBRARY.
VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a
bottom drawer.
A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open...
As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to
DICK:
VICKI
Come on.
Come with us.
DICK
No.
I can still help...
The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of
the library and heads off in the opposite direction.
There's
a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid.
WIPE TO:
At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are
VICKI and ALFRED.
They pivot suddenly at the sound of a
VOICE:
PENGUIN
Such primitive entertainment.
He's holding a gun on the two of them.
He stares about
delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave.
His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its
little plateau.
PENGUIN (cont.)
So Bruce equals Batman.
It seems I've
discovered two treasures!
(an evil smile)
Don't move.
I'd be only too happy to
shoot you both.
He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave.
He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of
the cavern.
It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow
CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below.
PENGUIN
The Gotham City Treasury.
It's about to
be stolen twice.
ALFRED
Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to
get it out of here.
PENGUIN
Oh, I'll manage somehow.
You two are my
guarantee of that.
(nudging VICKI with the gun)
Let's have a look, shall we?
You go
first.
He shoves her.
She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her
head.
SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter-
speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes
down the hallway.
She's just passed the balcony overlooking
the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path.
He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs
it in.
She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.
SELINA
It could've been so nice -- you and me --
if only you weren't so screwed up.
BATMAN
It's over.
I don't want to hurt you any
more.
SELINA
Tell me something -- one thing.
If you
don't enjoy all this...why do you do it?
He just looks at her.
He doesn't have an especially good
answer.
She sighs.
SELINA (cont.)
I'll never understand men.
She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat.
As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the
narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall
floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the
enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling --
-- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up
a GUN from his belt.
He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails
past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which
suspends the chandelier.
The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it --
and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry
hall.
On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand
fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies
sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving.
BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs.
Her arms and legs jut
out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering
YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat.
He stands over her; she glares
up at him.
BATMAN
Nine lives.
CATWOMAN
I can't move.
I can't move.
Her face is cut and bleeding.
She tries to lift an arm and
can't quite manage it.
He crouches down beside her, still
cautious...
CATWOMAN (cont.)
DON'T LOOK AT ME!!
(pleading)
Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I
want.
Please?
BATMAN looks up.
DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking
them, highly curious as to what he'll do.
BATMAN
No.
BATMAN slowly rises to his feet.
She lets out another
gruesome WHINE.
CATWOMAN
COME ON.
Don't stop now.
FINISH ME OFF.
(almost weeping with pain)
Son of a bitch.
You're all alike...
Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place.
With an agonizing effort
she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist.
She's trying to
slit her own throat.
He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and
breaks it open with his thumb.
He drops it amid the shattered
glass around her face.
A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out,
and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into
unconsciousness.
BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to
join him.
DICK
You should've done it, man.
You should've
killed her.
BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing.
BATMAN
There's a radio in the cave.
We'll send
for help.
The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK
FORMATION.
A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk,
and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT.
Now he has to follow; the
prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he
clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope.
They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK
FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the
catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.
PENGUIN
Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne.
Look at
you now.
Whatever would your friends say?
(smiling)
You've been an exceptionally congenial
host -- but I must ask you to back off.
The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they
climb the last few feet toward the grotto.
BATMAN swings his
cape around, concealing his hands from view.
He takes a
cautious step backward.
CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND
His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open.
ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI
They've pulled almost even with the rock formation.
A LARGE
DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.
PENGUIN
No sudden moves.
It's a long way down.
Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto...
HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO
A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all
these years.
GLINTING in the darkness.
Hanging upside-down,
above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them --
their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN...
He dislodges a rock.
It tumbles into the grotto...
...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the
rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE.
ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI
He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him.
He FIRES
HIS GUN wildly.
The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they
come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM.
VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them
FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life.
BATMAN
VICKI!
An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG.
Clean
hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down
across the rocks.
With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath
and VAULTS toward the CATWALK.
She's a foot short; she grabs
hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to
pull herself up.
BATMAN races toward her --
-- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky
outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN.
The BATS
have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the
cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN.
THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first
shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward.
As the second
spins him around.
As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE
RAILING.
VICKI screams.
BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand.
Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks
-- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip.
The ECHOES are cacophanous.
ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the
vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly
projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor.
And then --
BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS
IT.
It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet.
He stares
down at it, and two beats later --
-- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE.
Within
moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON
THE SIGNAL.
The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming.
A CHOKED
WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands
there, PARALYZED.
He's just been beaten at his own game.
He lets out a last
awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM --
-- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream
dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether...
BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk.
He rushes
over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her
protectively.
Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant
perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet.
They embrace
on the edge of the abyss.
On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED.
The
butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted,
clutching his wounded arm.
DICK slings an arm around him and
helps him to the stairway.
CUT TO:
The place is an utter mess.
Amid the carnage we find BRUCE
conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK.
In b.g.,
a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound.
GORDON
...and then Batman showed up?
BRUCE
He saved all our lives, Jim.
I can't say
for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind
the murders.
GORDON
God -- I pray you're right.
(beat)
One thing before we go, Bruce.
Who's the
kid?
BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are
righting the fallen Christmas tree.
BRUCE
Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin.
He's in
town for the holidays.
GORDON
Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit.
(turning to go)
Merry Christmas, Bruce.
Good luck
cleaning this place up.
GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR.
BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front
parlor.
ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD.
VICKI ambles up to
BRUCE:
VICKI
What are you going to do with all that
gold?
BRUCE
I dunno.
Might be a good start on a place
to live -- for some people who don't have
one.
She hugs him.
DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they
blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve.
VICKI
It's Christmas.
BRUCE
Yeah.
Maybe you should -- open your
present.
She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly.
VICKI
Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter.
None
of it matters.
We're all safe.
We're
together.
BRUCE
...You might as well.
He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT
BOX, which he hands to VICKI.
She unwraps it, opens it slowly
-- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside.
She gazes up at him, speechless.
He gazes back.
CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the
devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling
into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them;
ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace.
And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we
FADE OUT.
