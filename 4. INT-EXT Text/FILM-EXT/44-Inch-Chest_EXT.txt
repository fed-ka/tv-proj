COLIN emerges onto the street... Closes the door behind
him... We move in on his brave/sad face as he gazes up at
the old, bluey, London sky, and says to Liz's spirit...
COLIN
(Humbled. Accepting.
Very
quiet)
Be lucky, Liz.
Slowly he begins to walk the wet street... Away from us...
Towards his new life...
