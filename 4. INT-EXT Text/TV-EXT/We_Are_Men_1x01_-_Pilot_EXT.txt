      It pulls up to the curb. He hops out, and RINGS THE DOORBELL.

                                    WOMAN S VOICE
                    If you re looking for Sara... 

      It s the NEIGHBOR, pushing a stroller down the sidewalk.

                                  NEIGHBOR (CONT D)
                    She s getting married today.

                    uh... supposed to... read a poem.

                    First Presbyterian on Riverside. 
                    You better hurry.

      He dashes back to his car.



      The Mustang weaves in and out, passing cars.

      He jumps out and starts running along the side of the road.   
      He hops the fence, blazing a short-cut -- 



      He dashes across the grass, through a touch football game.



      He sprints by the trash bags and dumpsters. 



      He darts up the stairs two at a time and --



      He walks down the sidewalk, on his cell, leaving a message.

                                  CARTER
                    I ll take cooking classes with you.  
                    I ll totally wear the V-neck 
                    sweater you bought me. I ll never 
                    again ask you to do that thing in 
                    bed you don t want to do. Unless 
                    you want to spice things up, then 
                    I m willing to discuss it.

                      furnished, short-term housing.   
                    After being here a few weeks, I d 
                    say it s more like a way station 
                    for guys who just got divorced, or 
                    dumped, or are otherwise incapable 
                    of buying their own furniture.

      A 50-year-old, floating on a raft, listening to his iPod. 

      This is FRANK RUSSO, a college drop-out who built, ran and is 
      now semi-retired from a clothing manufacturing company.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Frank Russo. After sixteen years of 
                    marriage, he and his wife had grown 
                    apart.



      On Frank floating by, a satisfied grin on his face.

                    After his fourth divorce, Frank 
                    vowed the next time he found true 
                      happiness, he was just going to 
                    sleep with it for a few weeks.

                    can convince his wife to take him 
                    back. That was a year and a half ago.

                    I don t know the first thing about 
                    her. I m depressed, not dead.

      The CAMERA WHIPS to -- 

      A 38-year-old guy wearing a bathrobe and yelling into a 
      bluetooth cell phone hooked to his ear.

      This is STUART STEGEMAN, a feisty, Republican-leaning, Yale-
      educated doctor, with a booming OB-GYN practice.

                    Next time, Stuart fell for a more 
                    spiritual woman. Who unfortunately 
                    developed a taste for the material 
                    world...

                    He can afford a big house in Bel 
                    Air but he s living here, hiding 
                    his assets until a settlement is 
                    reached.

      He removes his robe, revealing a skimpy speedo.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                      Unfortunately, not all his assets.

      As he dives into the water, the CAMERA TILTS with him, 
      lingering on the AGITATED WATER. After a beat --

      WE PULL OUT of the water, to a view of all four guys sitting 
      in the JACUZZI.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    Here s the thing. It s never easy 
                    opening up. But since these guys 
                    have all been through horrible 
                      break-ups, I felt comfortable. I 
                    felt like I could tell them how 
                    much I still miss Sara.

                                  STUART
                    She s a whore.

                                  FRANK
                    Listen closely. Craig s list.

                                  CARTER
                    I m not ready to start dating.

                                  FRANK
                    Who said anything about dating? 

                                  CARTER
                    You guys don t understand. It s not 
                    that easy for me. Sara s the only 
                    woman I ve ever been with.

                                  GIL
                    Really? 

                                  STUART
                    That s impossible.                                                                                    9


                                  FRANK
                    I m offended by it.

                                  CARTER
                    I fell in love with her the first 
                    week of college. What was I 
                    supposed to do?  

                                  GIL
                    Junior year abroad? A semester at 
                    sea? 

                                  FRANK
                    No, no. This is a blessing. She did 
                    you a favor. We re taking you under 
                    our wing. 

                                  STUART
                    We did the same thing for Gil.

                                  GIL
                    I was here before you. 

                                  STUART
                    But you didn t use the time well.

                                  FRANK
                    Carter, look around you. You don t 
                    know it yet, but you re living in 
                    paradise. 

                                  CARTER
                    This is paradise? It s temporary 
                    housing. 

                                  FRANK
                    Temporary housing with a great gym.  
                    Indoor parking. Two Starbucks and a 
                    Coffee Bean in walking distance.  
                    And this is Hollywood. Actresses 
                    come through here all the time.  
                    Enter Frank stage left. Then 
                    upstage, downstage and backstage, 
                    if she ll let me. 
                          (sheepish smile)
                    And one did, last week, right here 
                    in this jacuzzi.

      Off looks of horror...



      Carter, Stuart and Gil check out the action.

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    The following night, we were right 
                    back out there. 

                                  CARTER
                    I think I m finally ready to meet 
                    someone.  

      Frank approaches with two ASIAN WOMEN -- a tipsy, attractive 
        fifty-year-old, and an even tipsier twenty-six-year-old.

                                  FRANK
                    Carter, there you are. This is May 
                    and her daughter, Jill.  

      As they ad-lib hellos, Frank WHISPERS in Carter s ear.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    She s a sure thing. You can thank 
                    me later.
                          (then, loud again)
                    Come on, let s let these two get to 
                    know each other.

      Frank grabs Jill, the younger woman, by the hand and 
      disappears into the crowd. May turns to Carter:

                                  MAY
                    I can teach you things.  

      As Carter ponders this...



      Carter shoots hoops -- Swish, swish, swish.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.) 
                    The next few days we all kind of 
                    kept to ourselves.

      Gil approaches. The mood is a little awkward.

                                  GIL
                    You re pretty good at that. Play 
                    college ball?

                                  CARTER
                    Started for Northwestern all four 
                    years.

                                  GIL
                    I was cut from my intramural team 
                    and replaced by a really good 
                      Vietnamese girl from the dental 
                    school. Really good. Triple threat.

                                  CARTER
                    So I feel bad about the other day.

                                  GIL
                    Don t sweat it. Those other two 
                    guys can be real jerks.

      Carter laughs. 

                                  CARTER 
                    Guess what? Stuart s friend called. 
                    I ve got that coaching interview 
                    next week.

                                  GIL
                    Wow. That s--

      Carter tosses Gil the ball, which SMACKS him in the face.

                                  GIL (CONT D)
                    Ow!

                                  CARTER
                    Sorry. You re worse than I thought.                                                                                   22


                                  GIL
                    Look, I m not here to play 
                      basketball... 

      During the following, Gil s nose STARTS TO BLEED.

                                  GIL (CONT D)
                    After I messed up my marriage, 
                    which I regret every waking minute, 
                    I thought the best thing to do was 
                    give my wife lots of space, wait 
                    for her to forgive me and --  
                          (feels his nose)
                    Were you going to tell me my nose 
                    is bleeding?

                                  CARTER
                    You were on a roll.  

      Gil tilts his head back and squeezes his nose.

                                  GIL
                    The thing is, I m still waiting... 
                    Now I only see her when I pick up 
                    my daughter. If you really love 
                    Sara, don t sit around, doing 
                    nothing. That other guy made some 
                    big, grand gesture. Guess what? 
                    It s your turn -- Excuse me, I 
                    think I swallowed a little blood.



      The car weaves through traffic. 



      Carter fills the tank.



      The car pulls up in front of the house from the opening. With 
      a head of steam, Carter marches up the path and bangs on the 
      door. After a beat, Sara opens it.  

                                  SARA
                    Carter? What are you --

      But he blows right past her...



      Establishing.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    ...were back at the apartment 
                      complex... 

      The CAMERA PUSHES into one of the windows to find...



      Gil watches Stuart and Frank play Call Of Duty. On the couch 
      next to Frank... JILL texts.

                                  STUART
                    Speak of the devil.

      Carter, in the REVERSIBLE V-NECK SWEATER, and Sara approach. 

                                  CARTER
                    Hey, guys. I want you to meet Sara.

      They ad-lib hellos.

                                  GIL
                    So, things seem to be going well.

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah, we re back together. 

                                  GIL
                    Awesome. No gifts, a simple thank 
                    you will do.

                                  SARA
                    We just came by to get his stuff.

                                  CARTER
                    We re talking about picking up 
                    where we left off. Sara spoke to 
                    the country club and we can get 
                    married as early as next month.

                                  STUART
                    Great. Maybe this time you ll make 
                    it all way through the ceremony.

                                  FRANK
                    They worked it out, Stu.
                          (then)
                    I m happy for you. But I gotta be 
                    honest. Even though you said a lot 
                    of things you obviously wish you 
                    could take back... you re going to 
                    be missed around here, pal.  

                                  STUART
                    Yeah, keep in touch. Let me know if 
                    you get that coaching job.

                                  SARA
                          (to Carter)
                    What coaching job?                                                                                   27


                                  CARTER
                    Oh, I was waiting for the right 
                    time to tell you. There s a high 
                    school in Woodland Hills that s 
                    pretty interested in me. They 
                    almost made it to the play-offs 
                    last year. Lotta potential.

                                  SARA
                    But you already have a job. My 
                    dad s dying to have you back. 
                    Actually, act surprised, you re 
                    getting a promotion -- V.P. of 
                    exterior paints and sealants.

                                  CARTER
                    ...um, that s nice of him, but 
                    coaching is something I ve always 
                    dreamed of and --
                          (then)
                    You know what? Let s talk about 
                    this later.

                                  STUART
                    No, no, I m enjoying this.

                                  CARTER
                    Actually, we have to get going. 

                                  SARA
                    We re meeting another couple at the 
                    farmer s market.  

                                  STUART
                    Ooh, don t want to be late for 
                    that. The white nectarines go fast.

      Sara and Carter say goodbye and head off. 

                                  JILL
                    He s never going to call my mom, is 
                    he?



      SLOW MOTION. Carter, with a big grin on his face, bursts out 
      into the sunlight, followed by the guys.  

                                  CARTER (V.O.)
                    In case you re keeping track. That 
                    look on my face is the last 
                    stage... acceptance.

                                  GIL
                    Why are we running?

                                  STUART
                    No idea.



      Carter, Gil, Frank and Stuart recline on lounge chairs, 
      checking out the ladies.

                                  GIL
                    Two o clock. Red bathing suit.

      The others sneak a peak.  

                                  CARTER
                    The chubby guy with the hairy back?

                                  GIL
                    Okay, more like 2:30, quarter to 3.

      Now they spot her.

                                  FRANK
                    Pass. Too young. Even I have 
                    scruples.

                                  STUART
                    Not pretty enough for you?

                                  FRANK
                    Not even for a weeknight.

      Frank s daughter, Julie, approaches.

                                  JULIE
                    Hey guys.                                                                                   33


      They all say hi, still smitten, as Frank gathers his stuff.

                                  JULIE (CONT D)
                          (she likes him)
                    Carter, right?

                                  CARTER
                          (he likes her)
                    Yeah. You remembered...

                                  FRANK
                    Ready to go eat?

                                  JULIE
                    Let s do it. See you around.

      Frank and Julie head off. But then he turns back to Carter.

                                  FRANK
                    No.

      Carter smiles. There s an upside to being single. 

                                  END OF SHOW*
