After the taping. The rhino lumbers down the hallway
toward wardrobe. He is suddenly grabbed by two large men
and dragged out through the exit into...
... where several
thugs in overcoats emerge from the
shadows and start
beating him with lead pipes. One of
the men pulls out
a GUN and SHOOTS the rhino several
times. The SHOTS
REVERBERATE through the empty garage.

ONE YEAR EARLIER
FADE UP ON:
It's the taping of another children's show -- "Rainbow
Randolph and the Krinkle Kids." RANDOLPH SMILEY, a
clean-cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie,
dances through Rainbowland with the "Krinkle Kids"
(little people in top hats). He sings one of his
signature songs: "Friends Come In All Sizes." One of
the main Krinkle Kids -- ANGELO PIKE -- dances behind
him.
RANDOLPH
(singing)
'Friends come in all sizes
That's a fact! It's True!
All colors of the rainbow
from Mauve to Blue...

RANDOLPH (CONT'D)
Their names may not be different
and their shoes may not match
One might say 'grasp' while the
other says 'snatch'
Some like to toss while others
like to caaaaatch... Beeee-
caaaause...
Friends come in all sizes
Take it from me! Golly Gee! Size
never matters when you want some
friendly patter
From a pal who is true and can
lift you when you're blue
You can count on him and he can
count on yoooouuuu!
It's true... that...
(big finish)
Friends come in all sizes!'
DISSOLVE TO:
MONTAGE - RAINBOW RANDOLPH MERCHANDISE
"Sugar Rainbows Cereal," plastic toys lined up on store
shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating
"Rainbow Potato Chips" and "Rainbow Candies." A "Rainbow
Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows.
Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We
get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the
kid shows.
A suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find
Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair
slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer
looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After
a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table
and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his
Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five
grand stares him in the face.
HUSBAND
So... uh... you'll make sure my
boy dances up front, right? Where
he'll get the most camera time?
Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple.
RANDOLPH
You want your kid on the show?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
HUSBAND
Of... of course.
WIFE
Yes, very much.
RANDOLPH
Then don't tell me how to run my
fucking business.
HUSBAND
No, no, we were just --
Randolph rises. He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and
picks up the briefcase.
RANDOLPH
I'll call you if a spot opens up.
He starts to walk off. Suddenly, the Husband and Wife
jump up from the table holding guns.
HUSBAND
Freeze, you cocksucker!
WIFE
Drop the briefcase!
Federal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph.
The Rainbow Randolph/Krinkle Kid set is being dismantled.
Backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece
is wheeled off. Workers with push brooms sweep up tons
of glittery "magic Rainbow dust."
We are TIGHT ON the sweating face of a MAN who looks like
he's about to be executed.

STOKES
is standing at the end of a long conference table as the
NETWORK BRASS glares at him.
STOKES
(addressing the brass)
Gentlemen, let me be the first to
say, in all sobriety, that I'm as
shocked and outraged as all of --
The network CEO, a hog of a man, cuts him off.
CEO
Save it for the papers, Stokes.
We've got nervous sponsors and an
angry public -- a combination
uglier than two monkeys fucking.
What are you doing about it?
STOKES
Well, sir, I'm currently in the
process of compiling a list of
viable replacements and it's my
hope...
CEO
Clean replacements?
With
background checks? I assure you,
Mr. Stokes, this network cannot
survive another Rainbow Randolph.
The goddamn P.R. department looks
like the Jim Jones camp.
Another EXECUTIVE chimes in.
EXECUTIVE #1
Remember, Stokes, this was your
dog that crapped on our rug.
EXECUTIVE #2
We trusted you, Frank. And now
we're in a tight spot. We have to
post our quarterly earnings next
month, for Christ's sake.
CEO
Whoever takes that slot has to be
a straight arrow. Clean as a
whistle.
EXECUTIVE #3
Right. Someone who'll take the
heat off. One of those sweater
types. Any chance of luring Fred
Rogers away from P.B.S.?
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
EXECUTIVE #4
Yeah, if we back up the Brinks
truck.
EXECUTIVE #1
No way. The idea now is to stop
the hemorrhaging.
EXECUTIVE #2
You better fix this, Stokes. Get
us a white bread replacement,
fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a
speck of controversy.
A giant hand slams on the table. All heads snap.
The CEO drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany.
Deafening sound.
CEO
(calm and measured)
Squeaky fucking clean.
Stokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of
wine as he goes over potential Randolph replacements with
NORA BISHOP, his pretty protege.
STOKES
Bumble Bee Billy?
NORA
(reading from a list)
Wife beater.
STOKES
Square Dance Danny?
NORA
Still appealing the mail fraud
thing.
STOKES
Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls?
NORA
Black was deported, and the
trolls... well, who gives a shit.
Nora kicks the table in frustration.
(CONTINUED)
6.
CONTINUED:
NORA
This is impossible. If I ever see
that Rainbow Randolph again I'll
strangle him. Choke the life out
of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck
until his eyes pop out of his
skull and bounce off the walls...
STOKES
Before indulging such cheery
fantasies, let's just concentrate
on saving my job. Shall we?
NORA
Sorry, Frank.
Stokes flips through a thick stack of files.
He suddenly
stops at one.
STOKES
What's going on with Sheldon Mopes
these days.
Nora laughs.
NORA
Oh my God. Have we sunk to that
level already? Smoochy the Rhino?
What a sap.
STOKES
Sap's just the pill we need right
now. Mopes is a straight arrow.
Always has been.
NORA
The guy can't get arrested, Frank.
He can't even break into the
birthday party circuit. Last I
heard he was working hospitals and
nursing homes. He's a joke.
Stokes stands up and walks around the room.
STOKES
The truth of the matter is, a
successful children's show has
always depended on two simple
elements: a fuzzy costume and a
lot of hype. Strip away the foam
rubber and the network money and
they're all jokes. Marginal
talents.. cabaret acts... off-
Broadway runoff...
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED:
NORA
I probably have ten acts in my
development file -- acts I've been
cultivating -- that are more
deserving than Sheldon Mopes.
STOKES
And each one a moral question
mark. Something I can't risk at
the moment.
NORA
(frustrated)
We can do better than this guy,
Frank. He brings nothing to the
table.
STOKES
Except ethics. With Mopes,
there's never been a whiff of
controversy. The man's an
ethical, harmless, cornball. In
short, a glass of milk on two
legs.
Stokes stops pacing.
NORA
Don't ask me to do it. You know
I'll do anything for you, but
please... not this...
Stokes gazes out the window at the city.
STOKES
Go find Smoochy.
Nora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his
street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger
over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which
holds Smoochy's head.
NORA
Mr. Mopes?
Sheldon stops.
SHELDON
Yeah?
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
NORA
I, uh, saw your performance
tonight. Very...
(searching)
... spirited.
SHELDON
Really? Thanks. I would've done
a longer set if that guy hadn't
pulled a knife on the security
guard. Once the pepper spray
starts flyin', that's it for the
encores.
NORA
Yes, that did put a damper on the
evening, didn't it?
SHELDON
Are you a new patient?
On the
juice, as we say?
NORA
Ah, no. But it's sweet of you to
assume so.
She hands him her card.
He reads it.
SHELDON
'Nora Bishop. V.P. of
Development. Kidnet.'
(to Nora)
Good gravy. You work for Kidnet?
NORA
As stated.
Sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it.
SHELDON
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you,
Nora. A real honor. Hey, you
hungry?
SMOOCHY THE RHINO - DAY
as it erratically limps forward before DROPPING OUT OF
FRAME.
WIDER
The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next
to Nora's desk, legs grinding lamely in the air. Various
Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top. A
restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Nora's
staff are in on the meeting.
NORA
Again, these are just prototypes.
I've been assured by FunZone that
all the bugs will be worked out
before Christmas.
Sheldon raises his hand.
Nora ignores him and looks at
her watch.
NORA
Okay, so let's recap before we
break up...
(refers to notes)
Yes to the Smoochy ice pops. No to
the Smoochy string cheese. And
we're in a dick-measuring contest
with Brown & Brown over the
shampoo split.
Sheldon suddenly stands up.
SHELDON
Okay, time out, people! If I may
interject, I think we're putting
the cart before the horse here...
Nora throws him an icy look.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
Smoochy's still earning the trust
of the kids. We don't want to
compromise that by asking them to
buy shampoo and cheese. How 'bout we
just concentrate on doing the best
show possible. Huh? Without all
the bells and whistles and
rickata-rackita. What do you say,
guys?
Nora casually picks up a Smoochy Frisbee from her desk
and sails it toward the open door. It lands in the
hallway.
NORA
(monotone)
Oh, damn.
SHELDON
No problem, I'll get it.
He walks out to the hallway.
NORA
(to staffer)
Shut the door please, John.
John shuts the door.
NORA
Now lock it.
He locks it.
NORA
Thank you.
Sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a
drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly
drunk.
SHELDON
... No, no, you misunderstand me.
It's not that I'm literally
comparing Captain Kangaroo to
Jesus Christ. I'm just saying
that the Captain, like Christ, was
someone you could believe in.
Those guys didn't care about bells
and whistles and rickita-rackata.
It was all about the work.
Especially Jesus. Forget about
it.
The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another
drink.
SHELDON
(waving him off)
That's okay, my good man.
Three's
my limit.
BARTENDER
I never saw anyone get loaded on
orange juice before.
SHELDON
Back in my college days I could
put away a carton of the stuff.
A sharply-dressed man, BURKE BENNETT, sits down next to
Sheldon.
BURKE
(to Bartender)
Gimme a Five Crown.
The Bartender nods.
He looks over at Sheldon.
BURKE
Smoochy the Rhino.
Wow.
I'm a
big fan.
SHELDON
(flattered)
Gee, thanks. I usually don't get
recognized without my horn.
Burke extends his hand.
BURKE
Burke Bennett.
I represent kid
show talent.
21.
Sheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table.
BURKE
Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in
the business to make you rich.
He's in it to make Frank Stokes
rich. That's how these network
goons operate.
SHELDON
That's so sad. Is it just me, or
is that sad?
BURKE
You know, years ago, a client of
mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a
problem...
SHELDON
Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?
BURKE
Yeah, before the asshole found
religion. Anyway, Stokes was
trying to screw my boy out of some
merchandising points. Claimed he
had a warehouse full of Dicky
dolls that weren't moving. Now
Frank and I are old friends, so I
say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me
the warehouse' -- see, I know the
fucking warehouse is in the Bronx,
and I know it's emptier than my
wife's head.
(chuckles)
To make a long story short, I walk
out with a check for a hundred
grand and Stokes is sitting there
with his thumb up his ass.
Burke laughs.
SHELDON
That's very amusing, but I don't
care about Smoochy dolls and
Smoochy floor wax... I just want
more creative input. This rhino
came from my womb. I bore him, I
nursed him, and dammit...
He pounds his fist on the table.
(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
I should be the one who raises
him!
BURKE
Shel, it's all about the dough.
After you get the money, you get
the power. And after you get the
power, you can have Smoochy walk
on stage with a hard-on if you
want.
SHELDON
It's funny, that never crossed my
mind.
Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up.
BURKE
Unfortunately, until then...
you're just another puppet in the
prop room.
He hands Sheldon his card.
BURKE
Give me a call when you're ready,
kid. I'll cut the strings and
open the magic door for you.
It's thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping. Dozens of
giddy children are led into the studio where they take
seats on the bleachers.
BACKSTAGE
Sheldon, in the Smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to
Nora. He holds a rundown for that day's show.
SHELDON
Excuse me, Nora. Why was the
'Please and Thank You Song' cut?
NORA
Because it's sappy and it takes
away from the 'Cookie Song.'
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
Takes away? It enhances it! The
cookie song is a meaningless piece
of fluff without the 'Please and
Thank You' coda! That's the moral
anchor! That's where the lesson
is! You can't sell the sizzle
without the steak!
NORA
It's cut. And I want the 'Cookie
Song' lyrics changed back to the
way they were originally scripted.
SHELDON
I can't do that. I will not
condone children consuming endless
amounts of refined sugar. I have
to look myself in the mirror every
morning.
NORA
This is network television, not a
sprout farm. We're here to sell
sugar and plastic. That's what
keeps the lights on.
SHELDON
You're treating me like a puppet.
You know that? Well, guess
what? I am not your puppet.
NORA
Since when? Now get your spongy
orange ass out there and dance
for the cameras.
An angry Sheldon storms off in frustration, but then
stops. He looks back at her.
SHELDON
We have different eyes, Nora.
When I go out there I see kids.
You see wallets with pigtails.
He moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He
obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the
studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring
at him from under the stairwell. After a beat,
Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's
clutching a duffle bag.
25.
Randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door.
He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's
multicolored "magic cookie bag." He opens it and tosses
the cookies into the trash can. Reaching into his
pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. He
chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag.
RANDOLPH
Bon soir, la Smoochy.
Welcome to
fatty Arbuckle-land.
He cackles to himself. He then notices a box in the
corner of the room. Scribbled in magic marker on the
side are the words: "Rainbow Randolph crap." He walks
over and pulls the box out. He slowly opens the flaps.
Inside is his old costume. He pulls it out and clutches
it lovingly. He smells it. The ECHOEY SOUND of his
THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment,
along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING.
RANDOLPH
(softly to himself)
Don't worry, little ones. Rainbow
Randolph will return...
(with rising anger)
After these messages!
He holds up Smoochy's magic cookie bag.
He then stuffs
his old costume into his duffle bag.
The "Smoochy Show" is in the middle of a taping. The
Smoochyland Band is playing a fast, jazzy number ("Doin'
the Jiggy Ziggy") as Smoochy, the Rhinettes, and several
kids dance frenetically. The kids in the bleachers are
in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically. The
song finally ends. The kids in the bleachers jump to
their feet, cheering and applauding.
SMOOCHY
Boy, all that jiggyin' and
ziggyin' sure makes a fella
hungry! Now if only I had my
super duper, super secret, super
special...
The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison:
KIDS
Magic Cookie Bag!
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
SMOOCHY
Right-o-riffic!
(looks skyward)
Magic Cookie Bag, I command thee!
Come to your lord and master!
The lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the "2001
theme." Smoochy's Magic Cookie Bag is lowered from the
ceiling by a filament wire. The kids go crazy.
SMOOCHY
(singing)
'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here
comes the cookies! Fresh and
organic, no need to panic! Right
from the soil, no tropical oils!
Sweetened with juice, for an
energy boost! Fiber galore,
you'll be askin' for more...'
ANGLE ON NORA
She looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the
bleachers. Their faces are filled with laughter. For
the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with
them.
ANGLE ON RANDOLPH
He peers out from his hiding place backstage. His eyes
widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its
descent.
ANGLE ON SMOOCHY
The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy. He holds the bag
high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as
the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him.
SMOOCHY
Oooh... just the smell of
unprocessed flour makes my tummy
do somersaults!
ANGLE ON RANDOLPH
RANDOLPH
(under his breath)
Whatever that means, you fucking
retard.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
SMOOCHY
His puffy orange hand reaches for the bag's clasp as the
MUSIC reaches its CRESCENDO.
RANDOLPH
He's practically shaking as he suppresses an insane
laugh.
RANDOLPH
Give 'em a cookie... give 'em a
cookie...
SMOOCHY
He reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls
out a flaming red penis cookie. The cookie is somewhat
misshapen and not perfectly formed. Smoochy gets a big
grin.
SMOOCHY
Wow! Look at this cookie, kids!
A rocket ship!
The kids "ooh" and "ahh."
ANGLE ON RANDOLPH
He looks confused.
SHELDON
What a special day with such
special cookies!
BACK ON SMOOCHY
Smoochy pretends to "zoom" the penis cookie through the
air.
SHELDON
Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I'm
flying to the moon! I'm flying to
Mars! I'm flying to --
Randolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it
anymore. He runs onto the stage. He grabs the rocket
cookie from Smoochy.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
Are you fucking blind?! It's a
cock! Not a space ship! Cock!
Cock!
Three burly Kidnet security guards drag Randolph down the
stairwell. They beat the shit out of him and toss him
through the exit door.
PAGE - DAY
The headline reads: "Rainbow Randolph Interrupts Smoochy
Taping." The subhead reads: "Runs Onstage Shouting
Penis Related Obscenities."
WIDE
Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the
paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a
chair near Stokes.
SHELDON
Thank you all for coming. I just
wanted to iron out a few wrinkles
I feel we're having in the
communication department. No
finger-pointing. Lord knows when
you start pointing fingers,
someone gets poked in the eye.
Sheldon laughs.
Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced.
SHELDON
Anyhoo, I'd like to turn the floor
over to my new agent, Mr. Burke
Bennett. So... heeeeeere's Burke!
Sheldon applauds.
Burke stands.
BURKE
As you can imagine, my client has
many concerns, not the least of
which is studio security, but we
can address that later.
He pats Sheldon's head like a dog.

29.

BURKE
See this guy, Frank? Take a good
long look, 'cause this prick saved
your life. Without him you'd be
sitting in Kaplan's right now,
sucking club soda through a paper
straw.

And, you -- you'd be organizing
puppet shows for the brats at
P.S. 86. Excuse me, honey.
NORA
There's no excuse for you.
SHELDON
Man, I love club soda.
Sheldon laughs, trying to lighten the mood.
Burke gives
him an affectionate slap.
STOKES
We've always managed to come to
some sort of arrangement, Burke.
Why the fireworks?
BURKE
'Cause I'm holding all the
gunpowder. I represent the man
who created, owns, and controls
every square inch of Smoochy the
Rhino.
Burke pours himself a drink from Stokes' private bar.
BURKE
God created Adam and what did he
get? A fucking dud. My guy? He
breathed life into a winner. And
anyone who does a better job than
God is gonna have a price.
SHELDON
Burke, of course, is in no way
comparing me to God.
BURKE
Yes I am.

30.
CONTINUED:
NORA
You seem to forget that we went
out and found 'your guy.' Dug up
his corpse. Handed him his own
show when he couldn't sell his
face to a photo booth.
SHELDON
To be fair, Nora, I was booked to
open a car wash in Montauk.
BURKE
Oh, so you were doing him a favor?
(chuckles)
Allow me to untangle this web of
shit! I don't care what his
resume was, I don't care where you
found him, I don't care if his
last job was juggling apples for a
hut full of Pygmies on the
outskirts of the Congo... the fact
is, he fits a bill and you need
him. Like a hungry baby needs a
big tit. And that, my friends, is
why you're in a box with no
ventilation. And that is why the
rhino is going to get what
he deserves.
STOKES
What is that, exactly?
Burke walks over to Stokes' desk and leans across it.
He's an inch from Stokes' face.
BURKE
Heaven, hell, and everything in
between.

BURKE
To the star and new executive
producer of the Smoochy show! May
your reign be a long and healthy
one!
They clink glasses.
SHELDON
I'm still in shock. Complete
creative control, part ownership
of the show, discretion over
merchandising and a dressing room
with a toilet! Am I dreaming or
what?
BURKE
And don't forget the corporate
penthouse. It took me six years
to get that for Randolph.
SHELDON
Boy, imagine... me, living in a
penthouse. Who'd a thunk it.
BURKE
It's called the high life, kid.
Get used to it. Pretty soon
you'll be burnin' one hundred
dollar bills just to see
Franklin break a sweat.
SHELDON
Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep
respect for money. Not to mention
Ben Franklin who had some
remarkable achievements in his
lifetime.
Burke pulls out a paper bag and hands it to Sheldon.
SHELDON
What's this?
BURKE
That's your graduation present.
Something you're gonna need now.
Sheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver. He
recoils in horror and immediately drops it back in the
bag.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
BURKE
Think of it as a tool of the
trade.
SHELDON
I've never owned a gun, I've never
touched a gun, and I don't believe
in guns. When I played cowboys
and Indians as a kid, I was always
the Chinese railroad worker.
BURKE
Trust me, Shel. It's a handy
accessory in this business. Even
if you don't load it, have it for
show. Sometimes that's all you
need. Especially with a creep
like Randolph lurking around.
Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking,
grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them.
Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his
crooked nose and scarred face. He extends his hand.
SPINNER
Hiya, Smoochy! I'm Spinner!
Spinner!
SHELDON
Hi there.
SPINNER
I'm so excited to meet you!
I'm
Spinner!
Spinner's massive hand engulfs Sheldon's.
SHELDON
(remembers)
Oh... right. I saw you fight on
TV once. I think it was your
farewell bout.

Through a SERIES OF CUTS we see Spinner getting pummeled
in various fights.

RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #1
Tonight marks Spinner Dunn's final
appearance in the ring. What a
pleasure it's been to watch him
proudly march into the record books
for taking more blows to the head
than any fighter in history.
A bloodied, defeated Spinner happily holds up the arm of
his opponent after a match. He then hugs the referee.
He jumps down from the ring and hugs the three judges.
RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #2
Scrambled a bit? Sure. You don't
retire with a record of 81-59 and
wind up the Governor. But on the
upside, he's got the disposition
of a collie.
Spinner wades into the stands and starts hugging the
spectators.
SWISH PAN TO:
Spinner is still pumping Sheldon's hand.
SPINNER
You know what I love, Smoochy? I
love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy
dance! You know, the one you do
during 'Silly Time?'
SHELDON
You bet.
That's a big one.
SPINNER
Wanna see me do it?
SHELDON
Well, I don't know why if there's
enough room here to...
Spinner starts Jiggying and Ziggying for Sheldon. He
bangs into a table and knocks over someone's drink.
BURKE
Okay, champ, don't get overheated.
Spinner stops, out of breath.
He leans over and hugs
Sheldon.

SPINNER
I love you.
SHELDON
I... uh... love you, too, Spinner.
A powerful-looking woman, TOMMY COTTER, calls to Spinner
from the bar.
TOMMY
Spinner, come over and meet the
Senator!
Spinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy.
SHELDON
He seems pretty popular. It must
take real talent to run a place
like this.
BURKE
Spinner? The guy couldn't run a
water faucet. He's just a mascot.
It's his cousins, a bunch of Irish
mob boys, who really run the
joint.
ANGLE ON SPINNER
He shakes the Senator's hand as Tommy and a few other
tough Irish guys stand around. Spinner looks over
towards Sheldon.
SPINNER
(loudly)
Don't go anywhere, Smoochy! I'll
be right back after I take a dump!
Spinner releases the Senator's hand and rushes off.
BURKE
I think you made a new friend,
kid.

We met him backstage with Smoochy... innocent face...
Angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn-down but tidy
apartment. A "Rhinette" costume is draped over one of
the chairs. There is a sudden LOUD POUNDING on the door.
Angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices
on the shelf above. He pulls out a revolver. The
POUNDING continues.
ANGELO
Yeah, who is it?
RANDOLPH (O.S.)
(friendly)
Open up, buddy! It's me,
Randolph! It's been a long time!
Angelo puts the gun in his waistband and walks to the
door. He slowly slides the chain off and opens the door
a crack. Peering in at him are the bloodshot eyes of
Rainbow Randolph.
ANGELO
Randy?
Randolph suddenly kicks the door open and tackles Angelo.
Randolph sits on top of the little man.
RANDOLPH
You fucking traitor! My body's
barely cold and already you work
for the rhino?
ANGELO
I don't know what you're talking
about.
RANDOLPH
Don't lie to me! I heard all about
it! You strapped that horn on
faster than a cheerleader gets the
clap!
ANGELO
I gotta eat, don't I?
RANDOLPH
You're a Krinkle Kid!
Not a
Smooch-bag! Say it!
ANGELO
Rhinette!
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
Say it: I am a Krinkle Kid! Say
it, before God! On the soul of
Jesus Christ! Say what you are!
Angelo punches Randolph in the mouth and flips him over.
He now sits on Randolph, pointing the revolver to his face.
ANGELO
I'm a Rhinette. Got that? The
Krinkle Kids are ten feet under.
With you.
Randolph starts crying like a child.
RANDOLPH
(blubbering)
I missed you so much. Can I stay
here? I got no place to go.
Angelo sighs and puts the gun away.
Angelo and Randolph sit at the small kitchen table.
Angelo watches as Randolph ravenously eats a bowl of
soup.
RANDOLPH
... They kicked me out of the
corporate penthouse. Big
surprise. Sons-a-bitches. That's
how I got this beauty.
He points to a nasty bump near his eye.
RANDOLPH
And of course, there's this...
He yanks his lip back to reveal a missing tooth.
RANDOLPH
That happened after my little
visit to the studio the other day.
Network security. Fucking savages.
He slurps another spoonful of soup and spits a bay leaf
on the floor.
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
I got liens, back taxes, lawyer's
bills, threats against my life...
I basically got the whole fucking
world up my ass. It's okay, I got
a loooong memory, son.
(Amos and Andy dialect)
What dey sow, dey gonna reap.
He cackles insanely as he picks up a bottle of gin and
takes a deep swig. He passes out and falls off the
chair. Angelo leans down and lifts his head off the
floor.
ANGELO
Stop doing this to yourself!
Randolph doesn't respond.
Angelo slaps his face.
ANGELO
Wise up! You hear me? Don't piss
your life away like this.
RANDOLPH
(half-conscious)
It's the rhino, Angie. He's been
sent by the devil. Sent from hell
to destroy me. Smoochy... is the
face of evil.
Sheldon whistles as he walks down the hall, giving
cheerful "hellos" and "good mornings" along the way.
He
enters Nora's office.
38.
Nora is on the phone. She pretends not to notice him.
Sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks,
examining photos on the wall, etc. Finally, he half-
whispers/half-mouths to her:
SHELDON
Whenever you get a chance... I
just need a second.
NORA
(into the phone)
Listen, can I call you back?
Yeah, some asshole's screaming in
my ear. Thanks.
She hangs up.
SHELDON
I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang
up.
NORA
If I didn't you'd still be here.
SHELDON
But I am still here.
NORA
I'm hoping to correct that.
SHELDON
Nora, I want us to start off on
the right foot. I want you to
know that I value your input and I
don't want you to feel intimidated
just because the power structure
has changed a bit. I consider you
a partner.
NORA
Great. That'll come in handy if
we're ever at a square dance.
SHELDON
Well, I was never much of the
do- se-do type, but what I would
love to do is take you out to lunch
one day. You know, just two
colleagues chewing the fat...
forming a mutual respect...
planting the seeds of
cooperation...
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
NORA
No.
SHELDON
Fair enough. If you change your
mind --
NORA
I won't.
Sheldon just nods and starts to exit.
SHELDON
Okay then, I'll be in my office if
you need me. If you want to
brainstorm about anything. Ideas
and so forth.
He passes a plant by the door.
SHELDON
Ficus?
She ignores him.
He exits.
Sheldon walks slowly down the hallway.
He no longer has
a bounce in his step.
Sheldon enters his plush new office, awkwardly walks over
to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time.
SHELDON
Wow...
TOMMY (O.S.)
My cousin Spinner's take quite a
shine to you.
Sheldon jumps. He's surprised to Tommy from Spinner
Dunn's restaurant. Tommy's crew, ROY, DANNY, JIMMY and
SAMMY occupy the sofa.
TOMMY
Ever since you came in the
restaurant. He can't stop yakkin'.
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
Well, he's a very nice man. Very
sweet disposition for someone that
size.
TOMMY
So, I was wondering if maybe you
could give him a little floor
space.
SHELDON
I'm sorry?
TOMMY
You know, a little part on the
show. You're the executive
producer now. You call the shots,
right?
SHELDON
Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and
I love Spinner, but TV is a
complicated medium and... I mean,
that would be like me getting into
the ring with a prizefighter.
(laughs)
Can you imagine such a thing?
Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet,
Mommy?
Sheldon laughs again.
Tommy gets quiet.
TOMMY
This makes me sad.
Very, very,
sad.
DANNY
What's wrong, Tommy?
TOMMY
Nothing.
I'm just very sad right
now.
SAMMY
Who made you sad, Tommy?
TOMMY
I don't want to mention names.
The guys look menacingly at Sheldon. They rise and walk
around his desk until they're on either side of him.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
You know what? Maybe I can find
Spinner a little something to do
on the show. That's probably the
best solution.
Tommy now smiles and walks over to Sheldon.
She musses
Sheldon's hair.
TOMMY
You're a good boy, Mopes. Don't
think we don't remember favors.
SWISH PAN TO:
Sheldon is in a meeting with a man, SONNY GORDON.
SHELDON
Look, I appreciate the visit, but
I'm just putting together a little
petting zoo segment. Nothing
fancy -- a few kittens... maybe a
duck...
ANGLE ON SONNY
SUPERIMPOSE:
SONNY GORDON, PRESIDENT, ANIMAL WRANGLERS'
LOCAL 358
SONNY
If you're looking to bring in that
many pieces I gotta put a crew
together. Plus, we're lookin' at
transpo, a few leash handlers, a
cleanup boy and a doper to keep
the inventory quiet.
SHELDON
Jeez, this all sounds awfully
elaborate. I might have to forgo
the union and just borrow a few
animals from a pet shop.
SONNY
I wouldn't recommend it. Miss
Carol from Romper Room tried that
once and she's still limping.
SWISH PAN TO --
42.
A frazzled-looking Sheldon is meeting with BEN FRANKS.
BEN
On behalf of FunZone Toys, I'd
like to congratulate you on your
recent promotion, and present you
with a small gift.
SUPERIMPOSE:
BEN FRANKS, V.P., FUNZONE TOYS
Ben reaches into his breast pocket and drops a large wad
of money on Sheldon's desk that lands with a thud.
SHELDON
Uh... that's nice of you, Ben, but
a card would have been fine.
BEN
FunZone Toys would very much like
the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes.
SHELDON
Is this... I mean... are you
offering me a bribe or something?
BEN
FunZone Toys would very much like
the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes.
Sheldon picks up the money and tosses it back to Ben.
Sheldon rises from his desk.
SHELDON
Normally, sir, we take the trash
out at the end of the day, but I
think I'll make an exception in
your case.
Sheldon escorts Ben out the door and slams it shut.
The
PHONE RINGS. Sheldon walks over and picks it up.
SHELDON
Yes?
ASSISTANT (V.O.)
A Mr. Feedlepepper on line two.
SHELDON
Who?
ASSISTANT (V.O.)
He says he's an old friend.
Sheldon punches line two.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
Hello?
INTERCUT:
RANDOLPH (V.O.)
You better grow eyes on the back
of your fucking head, you horned
piece of shit! I won't sleep
until the worms are crawlin' up
your foam rubber ass! I'm going
on safari, motherfucker... safari!
Sheldon hangs up stunned.
Nora walks in holding the daily
news.
NORA
Congratulations on your little ice
show.
SHELDON
What are you talking about?
NORA
It didn't take you long to sell out,
did it?
She tosses the paper on his desk.
NORA
What happened to your precious
integrity? Or was that just part
of your dog and pony act.
She exits.
A confused Sheldon looks at the "Around Town"
column.
INSERT - HEADLINE
"GARDEN TO HOST SMOOCHY ON ICE."
The subhead reads:
"HUGE GATE EXPECTED -- VENDORS SALIVATE AT SMELL OF BIG
BUCKS."
CUT TO:
44.
We are TIGHT ON the feet of an Irish dancer doing a sort
of Riverdance. We WIDEN OUT and the rest of the dancers
come INTO FRAME. Spinner and the mob ar clapping and
whooping.
Sheldon and Burke sit at a table in the dark club having
a conversation.
SHELDON
Burke, I never agreed to do an ice
show.
BURKE
Shel, do you know what kind of
cash we'll take in between the
gate and concessions? A venture
like this gets you money and
muscle. Times twenty.
SHELDON
Ice shows represent everything I'm
against. They're mindless
spectacles whose main purpose is
to sell overpriced sugar-water and
cheap plastic toys that splinter
in a kid's mouth on the ride home.
BURKE
Look, I know you got this fetish
for ethics, but now's not the time
to fly that kite. No one's ever
refused a shot at an ice show.
Sheldon tears the contract in half.
SHELDON
Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell
out, Burke. You should be proud
of that. Proud that you represent
a client who paves driveways, not
paints them over.
BURKE
I'm thrilled, Shel. Knocked out.
Burke just sits there, stunned.
A waitress, SANDY,
passes by the booth.
SHELDON
I'll have a pineapple juice,
Sandy.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
SANDY
Pineapple? What happened to
orange juice?
SHELDON
I'm feeling feisty tonight.
We are now on a drum solo. Ernie the Elephant of the
Smoochyland Band works it. The animal band plays a
sloppy version of "Pop Goes the Weasel." End on Spinner
Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band.
Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating
intently on the proper moment to hit it. Unfortunately,
his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off
as well.
We WIDEN OUT to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting
to dance to the off-kilter rhythm. The song finally
ends. The Rhinettes glare at Spinner. Smoochy addresses
the camera.
SMOOCHY
Boy, wasn't that fun? In an
awkward kind of way? Anyhoo, how
'bout a big round of applause for
the newest member of the
Smoochyland Band... former
heavyweight contender, Spinner
Dunn!
Spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the
entire bandstand over. There is a smattering of confused
applause from the kids in the bleachers. Spinner drops
the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor.
SPINNER
Shit.
Sorry.
A beaming Spinner runs up to Sheldon, who's still in
costume.
SPINNER
Did I do good, Sheldon, huh?
Did I
do good?
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
Yeah, that was great, Spinner.
Just watch your elbow next time.
Pinky's probably gonna lose that
tooth.
SPINNER
Okey doke.
I'm gonna go get drunk
now.
Spinner skips off humming "Pop Goes the Weasel" and
banging his cowbell. Nora passes Sheldon backstage.
NORA
Nice job. Casting the show with
mental patients, I like that.
SHELDON
(snapping)
He is not a mental patient. He's
an ex-boxer and nightclub owner
who happens to have the sweet
innocent brian of a five-year-old!
NORA
Excuse me for not making the
distinction.
She leaves.
Sheldon slides into the back seat of the limo. A big
thug in an overcoat, HENRY, is already sitting there.
Merv gets in behind him and shuts the door. Sheldon is
now wedged between the two men as the limo heads down
Broadway. Merv extends his hand.
MERV
Merv Green, Sheldon. It's a
pleasure to meet you.
SHELDON
If you're hoping for an autograph,
the gun's a bit much. The whole
'catch more flies with honey'
thing -- it really holds water.
Sheldon laughs nervously.
MERV
Sheldon, I represent the Parade of
Hope Foundation. Maybe you've
heard of us.
SHELDON
You raise money to build
children's hospitals, right?
MERV
We've been known to add a brick or
two, sure.
Merv and the thug laugh.
MERV
Sheldon, let me get right to the
point -- there's talk on the
street that you're pulling out of
the ice show. Is that true?
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
(big sigh)
You know, I never agreed to an
ice show, nor would I ever agree
to do an ice show, and let me add
that none of this is your concern,
sir.
(shakes his head)
Sheesh.
MERV
Listen carefully, son: Parade of
Hope has sponsored every Kidnet
ice show since 1964. We take a
piece off the top and everybody
walks away happy. So let's not
buck history.
SHELDON
Well, I appreciate the offer, but
for the gazillionth time, I'm not
doing an ice show, so we have
nothing to discuss. Now, if
you'll just pull over, I'll get
out and we'll say our toodley-dos.
(to driver)
Far corner, please.
MERV
Allow me to be less murky.
Starting tomorrow, Smoochy the
Rhino raises his baton for Parade
of Hope. Benefits, banquets,
fund-raisers, I want it all.
(to driver)
Pull over, Terry.
The car pulls to the curb.
MERV
And as far as the ice show goes...
I recommend you start shopping
for skates.
The door pops open and Sheldon is tossed out.
49.
A troubled-looking Sheldon stands on his balcony looking
out at the city. He drinks orange juice straight from
the carton.
Sheldon is on the phone with Burke.
SHELDON
This is unacceptable, Burke!
I'm
calling the authorities.
BURKE (V.O.)
Don't do it, Shel. You rat on
Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky
if they find your toenails. These
guys are the roughest of all the
charities.
SHELDON
I was threatened by an
organization that's supposed to
help children! What kind of world
is this?
BURKE (V.O.)
The real one. My advice?
Consider the ice show and stay
healthy.
Burke hangs up. After a beat, Sheldon's DOORBELL RINGS.
He walks over to the door and opens it. To his surprise,
Nora is standing there.
NORA
May I come in?
SHELDON
Sure.
Nora enters. She seems a little wobbly.
Sheldon notices
she's holding a pint of whiskey.
SHELDON
Uh... are you okay?
NORA
I'm getting drunk and I'm not used
to it.
SHELDON
Oh. Well, not to make you feel
worse, but with alcohol you're
also consuming empty calories.
Nora looks at him for a moment.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
NORA
It's just that... I want to
apologize, actually. And on those
rare occasions when I feel the
need to apologize for something,
it helps if I'm, you know... shit-
faced.
SHELDON
Wow.
I'm honored.
Nora trips slightly.
Sheldon takes the whiskey from her.
SHELDON
Why don't we get some air?
He leads her out on the balcony.
They look out at the
city.
NORA
I... I may have been a little
harsh when we spoke the other day.
A little out of line.
SHELDON
Well, it wasn't as bad as the week
before when you called me a pasty-
faced, no-talent hack.
NORA
Yes, that was probably insensitive
as well.
(looks at him)
I heard you're not doing the ice
show. I find that... incredibly
admirable. Why didn't you tell
me?
SHELDON
I guess I didn't want to spoil
your fun. You look so content
when you're berating me.
Nora looks down.
NORA
I'm afraid I have become a bit
hardened over the years.
Sincerity's an easy disguise in
this business. It's hard to know
who's on the level.
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
Believe me, I'm learning that more
and more every day.

'Sometimes light is really dark,
Sometimes crows can sing like
larks
Sometimes Winter feels like
Spring,
Don't think you know everything.'
NORA
(in disbelief)
'Rickets the Hippo'?
SHELDON
You remember Rickets?
NORA
That was my favorite show when I
was a kid. Rickets was the one
face I knew I could trust.
SHELDON
That's how I felt! Rickets had
real depth. He was my inspiration
for Smoochy.
NORA
Really? He was my inspiration to
work in children's television.
SHELDON
I can't believe it. I never met
anyone who even remembers Rickets.
Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky
dance?
NORA
Remember it?
I did it at my first
communion.
Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky-
Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and
look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and
kisses her.
SHELDON
I'm sorry. That was a mistake,
right? I didn't mean for that to
hap--
Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her.
They begin
kissing passionately.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
NORA
(as they kiss)
You're not full of shit like all
the others, are you?
SHELDON
No, no.
NORA
(as they kiss)
You're for real, right?
SHELDON
Yes, yes.
NORA
(through the kisses)
I mean, I couldn't tell... First I
thought it was an act... and then
I just thought you were a simp or
something...
SHELDON
Shhh... you don't have to
explain...
They continue to kiss.
Nora abruptly stops.
NORA
I should go.
SHELDON
Why?
Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse.
SHELDON
What's wrong? Is it the whiskey?
If you have to throw up, be my
guest. Anywhere you like.
NORA
It's just getting late.
Sheldon follows her to the door. She stops and looks at
him for a moment. The PHONE starts to RING. Neither of
them says anything for a beat.
NORA
Better get that.
Good night.
She exits. Sheldon shuts the door and sighs. He goes to
the bar to pour himself another orange juice before
picking up the phone.

SHELDON
Hello?
ANGELO'S APARTMENT
We GO TO a HORIZONTAL SPLIT-SCREEN. Randolph is on the
BOTTOM HALF. He lies on his bed in Angelo's apartment
wearing a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head.
His head dangles off the bed as he talks on the phone.
The SHOT is reminiscent of Bye Bye Birdie.
RANDOLPH
Hello, Mr. Mopes? My name is
Benjamin Kunklepeck and I'm
calling on behalf of 'Parents for
Decency in Children's Television,'
perhaps you've heard of us?
SHELDON
No, but I like where you're coming
from. It's an issue very close to
my heart. Why just yesterday I
was commenting --
RANDOLPH
Sir, we're having a banquet
tomorrow and we'd be honored to
have you perform for us. We would
also like to present you with a
plaque for your ongoing commitment
to children's television. The
presenter will be a young orphan
with mild asthma. Can you attend?
Sheldon is in the back seat. The Smoochy costume is next
to him. Behind the wheel is Randolph. He's in disguise.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
Don't be silly. The chance to
have Smoochy the Rhino perform at
our little soiree? I'd carry you
piggy-back through a bed of hot
rusty glass if I had to.
SHELDON
Well, it's always a pleasure to
help out a worthy cause. And
believe me, I've learned lately
that it's not all sunshine and
daffodils in the land of non-
profit.
RANDOLPH
I just looove your show, by the
way. It's such a refreshing
change of pace from that dreadful
embezzler... what's his name
again? Rainbow something or
other?
SHELDON
Randolph.
RANDOLPH
Yes. Rainbow Randolph. What a
scoundrel! He's probably gay too.
SHELDON
Oh, I don't know. I feel sorry
for him, actually. He obviously
has problems or issues that he
needs to sort out.
RANDOLPH
(getting frustrated)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you
take particular glee in that you
basically stole his time slot?
Helped shovel dirt onto his
miserable corpse, as it were?
SHELDON
No, I would never take pleasure in
someone's downfall. You know the
old expression about walking a
mile in another man's shoes?
Well, that really holds water.
Just try to imagine --

Come on, he's a fucking asshole!

Sheldon runs in and immediately starts singing and
dancing on the makeshift stage.

SMOOCHY

It's so nice to see good
friends!
Sing along with me now!
How do
you do, my good -- '
Sheldon abruptly stops singing as a look of shock comes
over him. PUSH IN ON his troubled face.
OMITTED
Several hundred men in Nazi uniforms in a warehouse
draped in swastikas. They all start chanting:
NAZIS
Heil Smoochy!
Heil Smoochy!
Heil
Smoochy!
A huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing
him like Patton in front of the American flag.
Flashbulbs go off. The "Heil Smoochys" continue. A
GERMAN MARCH starts to BLARE from the SPEAKERS. Looking
stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic. He clears
his throat. The MUSIC STOPS. Everyone quiets down. He
searches for just the right words, and finally...
SHELDON
It's my sincere hope that I'm
dreaming right now, but in the
event that I'm not... what's the
deal with the swastikas?
Suddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse.
LEAD COP
This is an unlawful assembly, you
kraut sons-a-bitches! You're all
under arrest!
Pandemonium ensues us all the Nazis run for cover.
Sheldon stands in the middle of it all, unsure what to
do.
Sheldon stares out the window as the dark city passes by.
We SLOWLY MOVE IN ON his eyes as we...
DISSOLVE TO:

On a large screen TV the smiling Asian face of Takashi
Yamashita, who's singing Cole Porter's "I Get a Kick Out
of You" in Japanese.
CUT BACK to reveal Takashi wearing a white sequined
tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano. He
looks like an Asian Liberace. He is circled by a group
of Japanese children who sing along with him.
CHICK (V.O.)
'Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for
Youngsters' is the hottest show
on Japanese television. The sweat
shops are working overtime trying
to keep up with the demand.
Record albums, toys, cereal, tee
shirts, you name it...
Several tough-looking Asian men -- CHICK, SAMBO, and TOBI
-- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office.
Takashi sits quietly in the corner. Stokes sits behind
his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine.
CHICK
Look, Stokes, let's cut the
bullshit. We want Takashi in
that Smoochy slot and we're willing
to do whatever it takes to get it.
STOKES
Pardon me for saying this, but for
a non-resident of this country,
you speak impeccable English.
CHICK
I'm originally from Teaneck.
STOKES
Ah.
CHICK
We own every hair on this bastard's
head and we're willing to share a

Chick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy,
walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk.
STOKES
Oh my.
And what is this on my
desk?
CHICK
Two hundred grand in a Louis
Vuitton duffle bag. Get our boy
the slot and we'll round it off to
a million. And you can keep the
luggage.
Stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his
desk.
CHICK
You're dealing with an honorable
culture, Frank. We know how to
play ball.
Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money.
He looks
up at Chick and smiles.
STOKES
Gentlemen, I suddenly feel
invigorated and full of hope.
Chick smiles.
On Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of
Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance." Nora
sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen.
There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the
"Best of Rickets" tape. She opens the door. To her
surprise, Randolph is standing there.
RANDOLPH

You've got three seconds to pry
your ass off my couch and get out.
Randolph jumps to his feet.
RANDOLPH
Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone!
You need that slot filled and
I'm ready to reclaim what's
rightfully mine.
NORA
Just in case you forgot, you're a
criminal and a scumbag.
RANDOLPH
Okay, so maybe I commandeered a
stray shekel or two. Big deal!
Compared to what Smoochy did
that's like jerking off in the
supermarket.
NORA
Where do you shop?
Randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders.
RANDOLPH
Come on. Have you lost all
affection for me? After what we
once had?
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
NORA
That was a long time ago.
I was
young and stupid.
RANDOLPH
Why we broke up I'll never know.
NORA
You turned into an asshole and I
didn't love you.
RANDOLPH
We could've worked through all
that.
He leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so
violently he almost falls over the coffee table.
RANDOLPH
Damn it, Nora! The public is
clamoring for me! I'm a fucking
patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's
evil! He's probably even gay!
You should've seen the way he was
checking me out in the car!
NORA
(suddenly suspicious)
What does that mean?
RANDOLPH
What does what mean?
NORA
You said he was checking you out
in the car. What car?
RANDOLPH
No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi
homosexual vibe! It emanates from
the television! The whole Smoochy
costume... with the erect horn...
I mean, what's that all about?
Nora starts to walk closer to him.
He backs up.
NORA
You're talking awfully fast,
Randolph.
RANDOLPH
I still love you!
Let's go on a
date!

NORA
Were you at that rally? Tell me!
Did you have something to do with
this?
She backs him against the wall and looks him in the eye.
NORA
Did you set Sheldon up?
Randolph just looks at her.
RANDOLPH
You know, now I remember why we
broke up. Always with the
accusations. Bitch, bitch,
bitch...
Nora hauls off and punches him in the jaw.
A morose-looking Spinner Dunn sits alone at the end of
the bar in the nightclub. Tommy walks over.
TOMMY
What's wrong, kid? The mayor of
Patterson's here with his wife.
They wanna meet ya.
SPINNER
I don't wanna meet no one. I miss
Smoochy! He never woulda done the
things they say he done. He ain't
no Nazi. Someone's making stuff
up. I just know it, Tommy.
Someone's making stuff up!
Spinner starts violently pounding his head on the bar,
causing GLASSES to RATTLE.
SPINNER
I want Smoochy back! I want to be
on TV again! I want to play my
cowbell!
Nora enters the restaurant.
She looks around and
approaches Tommy.
NORA
Hi, Tommy. Hi, Spinner.
Has
Burke been in tonight?
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
TOMMY
Haven't seen him.
NORA
Damn it.
TOMMY
Something I can help you with?
NORA
I have to talk to him.
It's about
Sheldon.
Spinner lifts his head from the bar.
SPINNER
Sheldon?
What about Sheldon?
Randolph is napping on Angelo's couch with an ice pack on
his sore jaw thanks to Nora's fist. There is a sudden
LOUD POUNDING at the door. Randolph startles awake.
RANDOLPH
I'm trying to sleep, asshole!
Read the fucking meter some other
time!
After a beat, the door is kicked open and Tommy and his
crew are standing there.
TOMMY
You wanna tell me about the rhino?
RANDOLPH
Hey, this is private property,
creep! And you're trespassing!
TOMMY
Danny, go give Mr. Smiley a little
back rub.
Danny advances toward a shaking Randolph, fist clenched
and rolling up his sleeve.
RANDOLPH'S POV - DANNY
approaches. He cocks his arm and throws a punch.
Danny's fist FILLS the FRAME, TURNING IT BLACK as we hear
the PUNCH.
68.
A makeup woman dabs Sheldon's forehead as he's about to
go on. Nora stands next to him. A LOW TYMPANY ROLL is
heard from the stage.
SHELDON
(to Nora)
I wouldn't be back here if it wasn't
for you.
NORA
I'm just sorry I didn't believe
you... that I got swept up in the
frenzy of anti-Smoochyism.
SHELDON
Well, this town's a house of mirrors
sometimes. It's hard to know what
you're looking at.
He takes a couple of pre-show deep breaths.
A STAGEHAND
approaches.
STAGEHAND
They're ready for you, Sheldon.
Sheldon exits backstage.
The lights in the studio dim.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Ladies and gentlemen... boys and

Who's your favorite rhino?
An explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the
bleachers.

KIDS IN BLEACHERS
Smoochy!!!
The lights come up as the Smoochyland Band plays a
strong, dramatic version of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic." After a moment, Smoochy slowly rises from a
lift under the stage. A giant sign above the jungle
lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks. It
reads: WELCOME HOME SMOOCHY!
ANGLE ON SMOOCHYLAND BAND
A beaming Spinner Dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell
to the music as tears stream down his cheeks.
BACK ON SMOOCHY
He majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids
who are giving him a standing ovation. The song
crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the
Smoochyland Band who sing, "His truth is marching on!"
Thunderous applause from the bleachers. Smoochy walks
over to a stool and takes a seat. It's very quiet in the
studio now. Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically
serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down.
He's in black limbo.
SMOOCHY
Thank you. It's good to be back.
You know, kids, sometimes life in
the jungle can be unfair. A place
where nice guys don't just finish
last... they get their heads cut
off.
Gasps from the bleachers.
SMOOCHY
That pretty world you think you
know is just props and scenery.
Lollipop trees with roots in
venom!
ANGLE - NORA
watches nervously from offstage.

BACK ON SMOOCHY
SMOOCHY
So look around you, boys and
girls. Every day. Be diligent!
Stand strong! As the old proverb
says: Beat a dog one time too
many and you get a wolf! Let's
start howling! Howl for me, boys
and girls!
The kids in the bleachers howl along with Smoochy.
SMOOCHY
Okay, I just wanted to get that
off my chest. Who wants to do the
Hokey-Pokey?!
The kids cheer as the Smoochyland Band launches into the
Hokey-Pokey song and Smoochy starts dancing. The kids
pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set. Everyone
is dancing and having a ball. Nora is clapping to the
music offstage. Sheldon and Nora exchange affectionate
glances.

Randolph sits in front of the TELEVISION in a daze. He's
wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese
curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap. ON the TV,
an "Entertainment Tonight"-type show with two perky hosts
is covering Smoochy's return to the airwaves. The hosts,
Tara and Hunter show Smoochy's dynamic entrance and the
standing ovation he got during the taping that day.
TARA (V.O.)
Well, Smoochy's back and boy did
we miss him. Hundreds of well-
wishers stood outside Kidnet
Studios today hoping to catch a
glimpse of their favorite rhino.
HUNTER (V.O.)
That's right, Tara. Smoochy's
popularity is stronger than ever
thanks to his recent exoneration
as a Nazi sympathizer. In fact,
several movie studios are offering
big bucks for a chance to bring
the Smoochy story to the silver
screen...
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
The BROADCAST CONTINUES. Smoochy images flash across the
screen. Randolph has been mumbling the whole time.
RANDOLPH
(quietly to himself)
Bad... very bad... too much for
brain... pressure building... ears
ringing... eyes burning...
contempt overflowing...
He jumps up and kicks the TV over.
He picks up a lamp
and starts beating the TV.
RANDOLPH
I hate you! I fucking hate you!!!
You devil-horned mind fucker!
Die, die, die!!
Angelo, who was cooking in the kitchen, runs out.
He's
wearing an apron.
ANGELO
What are you doing?! That's a
Zenith!
(notices cheese curls)
Look at this place!
He grabs the lamp from Randolph.
ANGELO
That's it! I want you out of
here!
RANDOLPH
(suddenly scared)
Where am I supposed to go?
ANGELO
I don't care!
(pointing to door)
Out!!
Spinner's massive arms envelope Sheldon in a bear hug,
practically lifting him out of his seat. Burke, who's
having dinner with Sheldon, holds onto the table before
it gets knocked over.
SHELDON
Easy, Spinner. Watch the ribs,
buddy.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
SPINNER
I missed you so much!
SHELDON
I missed you too, champ.
He drops Sheldon and pulls out his cowbell.
SPINNER
I've been practicing and
practicing and I got real good,
Sheldon. Real good!
He starts banging on it with a butter knife.
Sheldon
cringes.
SPINNER
Wanna see me march?
SHELDON
Sure, why not.
Spinner starts marching through the restaurant, clanging
the cowbell. People who are trying to eat their dinner
look annoyed. Sheldon sits back down at his table.
BURKE
So you were saying you had some
good news?
SHELDON
Yes. Some very good news. After
giving it a lot of thought... I've
decided to do the ice show.
Burke gleefully slaps Sheldon on the shoulder.
BURKE
Finally! I got me a bar mitzvah
boy. Today you are a man!
SHELDON
I realize now it's a sin to waste
your power.
BURKE
Like they say, rock bottom's a
college education.
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
But here's the really good news:
I'm doing it myself. No sponsors,
no vendors, no crooks. Not one
dirty hand will touch this. Not
one person will make a dollar off
these kids. Smoochy on Ice will
be a study in purity.
Burke's grin suddenly fades.
SHELDON
As far as food concessions go,
I'll supply the refreshments. For
free. Low sodium, whole wheat
pretzels and apple slices. Healthy
stuff. Now are you ready for the
best part?
BURKE
I'm holding my breath.
SHELDON
All profits from ticket sales will
be used to built a state-of-the-
art methadone clinic in Coney
Island.
Burke looks pale.
SHELDON
I'm not just talking a run-of-the-
mill clinic... I'm going to build
a methadone palace. A place where
men and women can withdraw in
luxury.
BURKE
Sheldon, you can't do an ice show
and cut out the vendors. And more
importantly, you can't cut out the
Parade of Hope. It's suicide.
SHELDON
You always told me, when you've
got muscles you make the rules.
Well, I'm feeling pretty strong
right now.
Sheldon rises and tosses his napkin down.

SHELDON
All this time I was letting the
business use me. Well, I think it's

I've got my clout back and I'm not
gonna waste it this time. Take care

Sheldon exits.
Burke sits there, looking very concerned.
On his way out the door, Tommy stops Sheldon.
Spinner's
COWBELL CLANGING continues.
TOMMY
Shel, you gotta help me out. He
bangs that goddamn thing from
morning till night. I got a
headache that goes from my eyes to
my ass.
SHELDON
Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say
it. You know I love Spinner. And
I owe you.

Give the boy something else to do on

Chick leans into Stokes' face.
CHICK
One week, Jeeves. Got that? Or

They exit.
Sheldon sits in the back of a limo on his way to work,
reading the paper. The headline blares: "SMOOCHY
ANNOUNCES ICE SHOW AT GARDEN." The subhead reads:
"ALL PROCEEDS TO BENEFIT BROOKLYN CLINIC."
SMOOCHY

Take it from me, Lester. Use your
power. Don't squander it -- build

LESTER
Sound advice, Mr. Mopes. If I
ever get any power I'll give that
a whirl.

Hey, what's going on up there?
Sheldon glances up from his paper.

SPINNER
What do you mean I can't play the
cowbell no more?
WIDER
Sheldon gently tries to break the news to Spinner who's
on the verge of tears.
SHELDON
You're too talented for the
cowbell, Spinner. Cowbells are
for babies.
SPINNER
(a little angry)
I ain't no baby!
SHELDON
That's right. You're a fully
grown man. With whiskers... and
scars... the whole sha-bang.
That's why you deserve a bigger
role on the show. A more
important role...
Spinner's face starts to perk up.
84.
It's the middle of a Smoochy taping. Smoochy and the
Gang are wrapping up a song entitled, "My Stepdad's Not
Mean (He's Just Adjusting.)" The kids in the bleachers
are singing the chorus.
KIDS
'Stepdads are people too/ They
have bad days, like we all do/
Be patient and help them through/
Stepdads are people too...'
Smoochy continues the song.
SMOOCHY
(singing)
... 'So three cheers for the man
that I proudly call Stan... He's
not quite a dad or a brother...
Yes, he gets cross, but still he's
the boss... And besides he takes
care of my mother!'
The song ends. The kids in the bleachers applaud.
Smoochy addresses them.
SMOOCHY
Remember, kids. First
impressions, good or bad, are not
always what they seem. Just like
a new puppy, new dads need to
adjust to their surroundings. So
give 'em time! But always
remember... if he becomes abusive
to you or Mommy... what are the
magic numbers?
KIDS IN BLEACHERS
(shouting in unison)
Nine-One-One!
SMOOCHY
Right-o-riffic!
The Smoochyland Band plays a little fanfare.
SMOOCHY
And now, boys and girls, I have a
special surprise. I'd like to
introduce the newest member of the
Magic Jungle... my cousin...
Moochy the Rhino!
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
The Smoochyland Band plays a happy little song as Spinner
Dunn, in costume as Moochy, runs on stage. The Moochy
costume is identical to Smoochy only it's a darker
orange instead of bright orange.
SMOOCHY
Howdy, Moochy! Welcome to the
Jungle! You wanna say howdy to
the kids?
Spinner freezes.
He stares at the camera.
SMOOCHY
Moochy?
SPINNER
My name is Moochy.
SMOOCHY
That's right. We've established
that.
SPINNER
(leaning into Sheldon)
Sheldon, this costume's makin' my
nuts itch.
Sheldon looks horrified. The Smoochyland Band quickly
launches into some music. Smoochy, Moochy and a few
other jungle animals begin to dance. Moochy's lumbering
movements are in stark contrast to the choreographed
steps of the others. As a bonus, he occasionally
scratches his crotch.
A happy Spinner (still in costume as Moochy) pokes his
head into Sheldon's dressing room. Sheldon, still in
costume as well, looks drained after the difficult
taping.
SPINNER
That was fun! Was it bad when I
done that thing, where I tripped
and knocked over the Flamingo and
then he knocked over the cameraman
and then those lights fell down on
that lady's head?

SHELDON
It's fine, Spinner. We'll edit it
out. But tomorrow in rehearsal
we're gonna work on a new thing
called 'the importance of hitting
your mark.'
SPINNER
Great!
I get to hit something!
Spinner dances off. A beat later, Nora enters and shuts
the door. There's an awkward beat of silence.
NORA
Hi.
SHELDON
Hi.
NORA
I read about the ice show.
SHELDON
Yeah, the papers seem to be really
covering it.
NORA
I think it's great. What you're
doing for that clinic.
SHELDON
Thanks.
She nods.
NORA
I just need some clarification...
SHELDON
Don't worry. Spinner just needs
a little more rehearsal. I'll get
him there.
NORA
No I mean about us.
Sheldon looks uncomfortable.
NORA
Ever since you've been back I just
feel like there's something that's
not connecting.

SHELDON
I guess I'm still readjusting a

brave men and women who protect
us overseas.
NORA
I just thought we were on our way

mistaken belief that you had ties

damper on our relationship, but

Sheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her. He kisses her
passionately. Nora immediately starts ripping off his
costume as they make out. They fall to the floor in
a lustful embrace.
Spinner, humming to himself, lumbers down the hallway on
his way to the wardrobe room. Halfway down the hall, he
hears a voice call out to him.
VOICE (O.S.)
Hey -- rhino.
Spinner turns around. The door to the fire exit swings
open. Two of Merv's thugs emerge and grab Spinner (who's
still in full Moochy costume) and drag him into the
stairwell.
Spinner is dragged into the garage and knocked to the
pavement. Several more thugs emerge from the shadows,
including Henry, Merv's main henchman. They start
beating him with lead pipes. Henry pulls out a REVOLVER.
He SHOOTS the rhino several times. A sedan trunk is
popped open and Moochy is thrown inside. The CAR
SCREECHES up to the street.
We CRANE DOWN FROM a Chinese banner that stretches across
two tenements. We LAND ON the seedy, deserted street
below as the SEDAN BARRELS INTO FRAME and SQUEALS to a

Two thugs emerge from the car. They pull Spinner/Moochy
from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans,
knocking a few over. They get back in the car and speed
away. Moochy's lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter
and lays motionless. Blood seeps through his foamy
torso.
LOW OVERHEAD SHOT

MITCH
All you said was 'hit the rhino.'
You never specified the color.
I'm not taking the blame for this
one.
Merv's anger builds. He turns to a picture of Smoochy
which is tacked to a bulletin board along with other kid
show personalities that the foundation extorts. Merv
picks up a letter opener and violently thrusts it into
the picture.
MERV
I'm not through with you yet,
rhino! Your time will fucking

Cops rummage through Angelo's apartment. In the b.g.,
a detective, ELLIS, interviews Angelo. Another
detective, McCALL, is looking through some papers he
found.
McCALL
Ellie, over here.
Ellis walks over. McCall shows him some scribblings he's
found in a notebook of Randolph's. The crude drawings
depict Smoochy with his head cut off... with a knife in
his heart... being pissed on by Randolph, etc. "Die,
Rhino, Die" is scrawled hundreds of times, filling page
after page. The two detectives look at each other and

Tommy and the boys walk over. Tommy puts his arm around
Sheldon as he gazes somberly at Spinner.
TOMMY
He really loved you, Shel. And

They won't do the ball thing.
It's against procedure.

SHELDON
That's okay, Tommy.
I'll be fine.

ACTION
Inside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around
and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window
sill. A makeshift living area has been set up in the
middle of it all -- a chair, lamp, small table, hot
plate, etc. Randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor
belt, huddled under a blanket.
Angelo enters the factory through a rusty door, carrying
provisions.
ANGELO
It's heatin' up out there. Every
cop in New York is looking for
you. And Tommy Cotter's boys are
combin' the streets. You're gonna
have to stay put for a while.
Randolph sits up on the conveyor belt, blanket draped
over his shoulders. He's a physical and emotional wreck.

Angelo hops up on the conveyor belt to console Randolph.
Randolph rests his head on Angelo's shoulder.
ANGELO
You didn't want to kill yourself,
Randy. You know that.
RANDOLPH
Perhaps it's time to heal. To
accept the fact that Smoochy has
won and gracefully march forward.
True, I'm currently wanted for a
murder I didn't commit. But I
have faith. Faith that justice
will prevail.
ANGELO
Now you're talkin', kid. This is
a big step... I'm proud of you.
He strokes Randolph's head.
RANDOLPH
Did you bring lunch?
ANGELO
Yes.
RANDOLPH
Chicken and stars?

Angelo lifts one of the grocery bags onto the conveyor
belt.
ANGELO
Here, I got you some crossword

Angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot
plate. He starts to open a can of soup. Randolph
reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York
Post. The lead article's headline reads, "WAKE FOR
SPINNER." A large photograph shows mourners leaving the
restaurant after the wake. Clearly visible are Sheldon
and Nora. They have their arms around each other.
Randolph's eyes widen. He starts to hyperventilate.
Angelo looks up.
ANGELO
You okay? Randy?
Finally, Randolph expels a blood-curdling scream that
ECHOES through the factory.
RANDOLPH
Motherfucker!!!!!!!
Angelo drops the soup.
Birds in the factory flutter from
the rafters.
Sheldon and the Rhinettes work on some choreography for
that night's show. Nora watches from the sidelines. As
Sheldon skates on the ice rink, Merv enters with Roy and

of the warehouse as he begs Tommy for his life. Merv's
two henchmen lay dead nearby. Roy, Jimmy and Sammy --
Tommy's guys -- stand behind her.
MERV
It was a mistake! An honest
mistake! All I'm trying to do is
help children.
TOMMY
You like kids, huh?
MERV
Yes!
Of course!
TOMMY
So you must know a few fairy
tales. Danny, tell him the one
about the worthless prick who gets
his head chopped off.
Danny, holding a hatchet, advances toward Merv. Tommy
casually walks away. We STAY WITH Tommy. Merv is NO
LONGER IN FRAME.
MERV (O.S.)
No... no... no!
He SCREAMS.
We hear the sound of the HATCHET HITTING its target.
Merv's pleading stops.
TOMMY
Now you know why charities go
under sometimes.
SHELDON
Do we really need to hear this?
I don't want to hear this.
JIMMY
A clean cut.
SHELDON
Okay, got it.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
ROY
And then we took his head and --
SHELDON
Thank you! Specifics about his
head are superfluous at this
point.
Nora is alone in Stokes' office, rearranging cards on
the giant cork board that displays the network schedule.
She is startled to hear a deep voice behind her.
VOICE (O.S.)
Where is he?
She turns around. Chick, Tobi, and Sambo are standing
there. Chick walks over to the cork board. He scans a
row of cards that all read "Smoochy."
NORA
(attitude)
Can I help you with something?
CHICK
Yeah, honey, you can help us
with something...
He rips a Smoochy index card from the board, walks over
to her and waves it in her face.
CHICK
You tell that boss of yours he
better take care of the rhino
problem. In my culture we honor
deals or invite consequences.
NORA
I don't know what you're talking
about and your cologne's making
me nauseous. Other than that,
you're great company.
Chick looks at his boys and chuckles.
CHICK
Spicy little thing, isn't she?
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
He suddenly pulls out a switchblade and holds it to
Nora's throat.
CHICK
Takashi gets that time slot. You
hear me, girly? Tell that boss of
yours we'll kill everyone at this
fucking network if we have to.
Starting with the pretty ones.
He removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward
the bulletin board. It lands -- sticking right in the
middle of a Smoochy card.
CHICK
Auf Wiedersehen, honey.
They exit.
Nora is pacing.
Sheldon sits by the fire.
NORA
It's Stokes. He's behind the
whole thing! He cut some kind of
deal for the Smoochy slot!
SHELDON
What are you talking about?
NORA
He wants you out so he can put
Takashi in!
SHELDON
Who's Takashi?
NORA
Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever
pick up a copy of International
Performer? He's the hottest kid
show host from Asia.
Sheldon's head is swimming. Suddenly the front door to
to the penthouse bursts open. Randolph, dressed like
he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs
in a little bonfire. All we need
is a few sticks and some wienies.
He almost trips as he stumbles over to Sheldon.
He
waves the gun in his face.
RANDOLPH
I had her before you! Pachyderm!
I was in love with her! In love!
And you snatched her away! Like
a common thief! You're the bad
guy! Not me! He's the bad guy,
Nora. He's incapable of
understanding the love we once
had! Tender, yet passionate.
Old-fashioned, yet experimental.
(cackles)
Tell him about a few of our
experiments, Nora! Tell him!
Sheldon looks stunned.
Nora hangs her head.
SHELDON
(to Nora)
Is this true? Please tell me it's
just the confused ramblings of a
diseased mind.
She looks at him, but doesn't say anything.
SHELDON
Holy mother of Toledo. When
exactly were you planning to let
me know about this?!
NORA
(turns to Sheldon)
Listen, there was a time -- and
I'm not proud of this -- but there
was a time when I was a bit of
a... kiddie-host groupie.
RANDOLPH
You're just another action figure
for her collection!
NORA
That's not fair!
RANDOLPH
Tell him about Jingle Jackson!
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
You dated Jingle Jackson?
RANDOLPH
The bells turned her on. Hey,
tell him about Jumbo Johnny!
There's a tale for ya! A whale
of a tale!
She looks down, somewhat ashamed.
A look of utter shock
comes over Sheldon.
SHELDON
Oh good Lord in Heaven.
NORA
Look, what I did before I met you
is none of your business.
RANDOLPH
Shut up!
Both of you! This is
my show!
He waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an
armchair and sits down.
RANDOLPH
Do you fully understand the power
of a condemned man? Do you? I'm
already wanted for one murder, why
should I give a flaming horse's
twat if I commit two more?
SHELDON
I... uh... read once that the best
way to diffuse a tense situation
is with a little humor. To that
end, would you like to hear a
funny joke?
RANDOLPH
(rolling his eyes)
Oh, please. Go blow yourself,
Martha.
(waves gun again)
Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me
one of those drinks that used to
make us all warm and fuzzy before
bouncy-bouncy time!
NORA
Fix it yourself, asshole.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
(points to gun)
Remember, I have Mr. Boomy.
SHELDON
I'm telling you, you'd love this
joke. It revolves around Santa
Claus and the Easter Bunny getting
into a fender bender.
Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar.
RANDOLPH
(to Sheldon)
You know, when I lived here I used
to have a big painting above the
fireplace. A naked chick holding
a pumpkin. It was very tasteful.
No bush...
NORA
Look, Randolph. We know it
wasn't you who killed Spinner.
SHELDON
We'll go to the police, first
thing tomorrow... straighten
everything out.
RANDOLPH
Oh!
Goody-goody gumdrops!
(to Nora)
Vodka straight up is fine, sugar
babe!
He grabs the bottle out of her hand. He rises from the
chair. He takes a CD, "PARTY TIME WITH RAINBOW
RANDOLPH," from his pocket and puts it into an
audio system on the fireplace wall.
RANDOLPH
Did you put on a little weight,
honey? That's okay, you're still
a hot little brood mare. I bet
you miss the sweet sting of my
riding crop. Giddy up, pony!
The THEME SONG from his show starts to PLAY. He flicks
a switch and a spotlight goes on. He sings and dances.
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
(to tune of
'Ol' MacDonald)
'Rainbow Randolph is the man.
Yes he, yes he, is.
He's the Prez of Rainbowland.
Yes he, yes he, is.
With some fun, fun here, and a
laugh, laugh there.
Here a dance, there a song,
Everything is fun, fun.
Rainbow Randolph is the King, the
King of Rainbowland!'
Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle.
Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab
the gun. Randolph shrieks. The two men wrestle on the
floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter. He
screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace.
SHELDON
Is this what you want? A Hansel
and Gretel ending?! You want to
be the big bad wolf?
RANDOLPH
Stop! It's too hot!
The heat!
It's driving me mad!
Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom. Nora reaches for a
fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it. Randolph
cries out and drops the gun. Sheldon grabs it and points
it at Randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a
child. He's bleeding.
RANDOLPH
Go ahead, kill me! Finish me off.
My life's over anyway. Everything
I touch turns to shit. Put me out
of my misery.
Sheldon slowly takes the gun away from Randolph's head.
SHELDON
You're not nothing. You're
bitter, misguided and I'm guessing
a raging alcoholic, but you're
still Rainbow Randolph. Despite
everything that's happened, you
once made children happy.
Randolph sits up and looks at Sheldon through watery
eyes.
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
Would you be my friend?
SHELDON
Sure.
RANDOLPH
(to Nora)
You too?
NORA
I guess.
RANDOLPH
Sorry about the brood mare stuff.
Randolph throws his arms around Sheldon and cries into
his shoulder. Sheldon pats his back. He glances down at
Randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy.
Nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from
one of the chairs. She kneels next to Randolph and blots
the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow.
Randolph lets out a blood curdling scream.
LATER
being loaded.
WIDER
Sheldon loads his gun as Randolph is curled up on the
couch like a little puppy. Nora hands him a cup of tea.
RANDOLPH
(a pitiful child)
Thank you.
She walks over to Sheldon.
NORA
(re: gun)
What are you doing?
Sheldon continues to load the gun.
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
SHELDON
Just making the playing field
even. I'm tired of running this
race with one leg.
NORA
You're letting them drag you down
to their level.
RANDOLPH
(from couch)
She's right, Sheldon. Don't make
the same mistakes I did. Keep
your dignity intact.
He accidentally spills some hot tea on himself.
RANDOLPH
Son-of-a-bitch!
SHELDON
I appreciate everyone's concern,
but I can take care of myself.
Nora and Randolph look at each other.
RANDOLPH
(mouthing to Nora)
I tried.
Sheldon stuffs some extra bullets in his pocket.
SHELDON
(to Randolph)
Okay, buddy, we have to get down
to the Garden. You're welcome to
stay here as long as you like.
Just don't leave until I get
things squared away.
Randolph gets up and walks over to him.
RANDOLPH
Be careful, Sheldon. Remember
what I told you -- you've only
scratched the surface of this
scummy business. You have yet to
strike oil.
Randolph looks at him for a moment before turning to
Nora.
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
You're lucky to have a guy like
Smoochy.
NORA
You just rest, Randolph.
RANDOLPH
He's the real thing. Smoochy's the
real thing. And I've been a fraud.
A wicked man doing wicked acts.
Sheldon slaps the cylinder into place and tucks the gun
in his waistband.
SHELDON
Well, we all have our bad days.
He exits.
A hula dancer performs on a tiny stage in the nightclub.
A small Hawaiian string band plays behind her. Burke
and a nervous-looking Stokes sit in a booth.
STOKES
Things are getting out of hand.
We have to cover our tracks.
BURKE
Relax, everything's gonna work
out.
STOKES
Relax? They found Merv Green's
head on the Grand Concourse!
Excuse my concern.
BURKE
Look, we can cover all the tracks
we want, but in the end we still
got the same problem. We gotta
finish what we started.
STOKES
God help us...
Stokes shakily takes a sip of his drink.
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
BURKE
It'll all be over tonight.
Buggy's gonna take care of
everything.
STOKES
Buggy? Buggy Ding-Dong? The guy
who hosted 'Buggy's Bumpy
Railroad'?
STOKES
Yeah, until he discovered the joys
of Turkish black mule heroin. For
the right price he'll do anything.
It's amazing the guy's still alive.
Stokes buries his head in his hands.
STOKES
I don't know, Burke... this whole
thing...
A shadow falls across their table.
Burke looks up.
BURKE
Speak of the devil. Have a seat,
Bug.
Buggy Ding-Dong's hand ENTERS the FRAME and snubs out his
Camel. Stokes looks up.
STOKES
(attempting to
sound cheerful)
Buggy. You're looking good.
ANGLE ON BUGGY
A man who looks like he would first kill you then eat you
for dinner, slides into the booth next to Stokes.
BURKE
It's time we put this thing to
rest, Frank. And the way I see
it... the rhino's up past his
bedtime.
Burke hands a folded envelope to Buggy who puts it into
his jacket pocket. He lights another Camel.
107.
Ushers, costumed as Rhinettes, help people to their
seats. People mull about the concession stands which
are adorned with signs that read: "Complimentary Apple
Slices!" "Have a Salt-Free Pretzel!" "Enjoy a Soy Dog
on Smoochy!" "Fresh Squeezed O.J. -- Have a Glass!"
"Sugar Free Brownies -- They're Not as Bad as they
Sound!" "Free! Everything is Free!" "Keep Your
Wallet in Your Pocket!" "Friendship is More Important
than Money!"
Angelo's place looks like a cyclone hit it. Angelo
works free from the ropes that have bound his wrists.
He has been hit over the head and is groggy as he
reaches for the phone.
A freshly showered Randolph is wearing Sheldon's robe and
has a pink towel wrapped around his head as he lounges on
the living room sofa. He's eating grapes and reading
National Geographic. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up.
RANDOLPH
(sing-songy)
Hellooo!
We GO TO a SPLIT-SCREEN with Angelo.
ANGELO
Randy, is that you?
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
RANDOLPH
Yes, Angelo, my little Twinkie,
shouldn't you be getting ready for
the big show?
ANGELO
Listen, Buggy's been here.
RANDOLPH
Buggy Double D's?
The Dong Man?
ANGELO
Yeah, he lifted my backstage pass
and he's braggin' that he's
doing some kind of job for Burke
Bennett.
Randolph thinks.
He suddenly looks very worried.
RANDOLPH
Sheldon's in trouble.
I gotta get
down to the Garden.
ANGELO
The place is crawling with cops.
They'll jump on you like a
trampoline.
RANDOLPH
I don't care.
He rips the towel from his head.
RANDOLPH
I have to warn the rhino.
Buggy, in his ill-fitting Rhinette costume, emerges from
the sub-basement carrying a thin suitcase. As far as
anyone's concerned, he's just another usher. He heads
for the stairwell.
Every seat in the arena is occupied. The lights are
lowered. A slow rolling TYMPANY is heard. After a
moment, the Rhinettes skate out to enthusiastic applause.
109.
BACKSTAGE
Sheldon, looking very intense, stands alone in the wings.
He takes a couple of deep breaths. We TILT DOWN and see
the bulge of the revolver under his Smoochy costume.
ICE RINK
The Rhinettes have formed a line across the middle of the
rink.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And now... it gives us great
pleasure to introduce America's
favorite rhino... ladies and
gentlemen... boys and girls...
(dramatic pause)
Heeeeere's Smoochy!
Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause. The entire
arena is on its feet. The Rhinettes part as Smoochy
skates through them and stops in the middle of the rink.
The applause and cheering don't stop for several moments.
One of the Rhinettes hands Smoochy a microphone.
SMOOCHY
On behalf of myself, the
Rhinettes, and the soon to be
restored Coney Island Methadone
Center, I thank you all for
coming.
NETWORK BOX
Burke and Stokes roll their eyes.
BACK ON SHELDON
SMOOCHY
It was my original intention that
tonight's performance would be a
benign mix of Smoochy songs and
ice dancing. But as an artist, I
believe I must convey to you, my
fans, what I'm feeling at any
given moment in my life. To do
otherwise would be dishonest. Art
is communication. It's something
we learn and hopefully grow from.
With that in mind... I hope you
enjoy the show.
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
More applause as Smoochy skates over to the Rhinettes.
They form a circle around him and slap hands in
solidarity.
SHELDON
This is for Spinner.
The lights go down. A full orchestra begins to play the
overture to WAGNER's Tristen et Isolde. The lights come
up as a soprano -- a heavyset woman in a modified rhino
costume -- skates out through the fog and begins singing
the opera. Smoochy -- now wearing a peasant's frock --
skates an interpretive dance in the b.g. with a few
Rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants. A beautiful
fairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the
rafters and takes Smoochy's hand. She skates away with
him as he waves good-bye to the Rhinettes.
HIGH ANGLE
LOOKING DOWN AT the opera. The CAMERA PANS OVER TO the
catwalk high above the rink.
CATWALK
Buggy Ding-Dong, still in his Rhinette costume, settles
into his assassin's roost. He begins to assemble the
rifle and check the scope.
The "Opera on Ice" continues. The soprano continues
singing as Smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent
life. The fairy princess brings Smoochy to a room with a
gleaming white desk. Smoochy takes a seat behind the
desk. The fairy princess places a crown on his head,
bids him good-bye, and floats away. Smoochy sits proudly
in his new world.
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
Suddenly, Rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate
in a circle around the desk. They throw money at Smoochy.
He jumps up and skates away, but the Rhinette devils
pursue him with daggers. The music from the orchestra
intensifies as the drama plays out.
NETWORK BOX
Nora continues to watch the opera, totally entranced.
Stokes and Burke look a little on edge. Burke glances at
his watch.
CATWALK
Buggy finishes loading the rifle. He shines the barrel
with his sleeve and looks through the scope as Smoochy
and company continue to perform below.
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE
Atmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick
that Buggy has difficulty FINDING Sheldon THROUGH the
cross-hairs. Occasionally, Smoochy skates through a hole
in the clouds only to disappear again. BUGGY CURSES in
frustration.
ARENA
Randolph pushes his way past Garden security and runs
toward the rink. Several cops working the event spot
him. A few spectators scream in horror.
ICE RINK
The soprano's mournful aria reaches its crescendo as
Smoochy is now pursued by Rhinettes dressed as Nazis.
They hold signs with words like "SCANDAL" and "SHAME."
Smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling
Chinatown where he lands over a fallen "Moochy." He
cradles Moochy's head in his arms as the Nazis glide past
him and disappear into the fog.
NETWORK BOX
Nora wipes a tear from her eye as she watches the tragedy
play out. Burke and Stokes glance skyward. Nora notices
this.
112.
RINK'S EDGE
Randolph reaches the rink as cops push their way toward
him.
RANDOLPH
Sheldon!!!
But Sheldon can't hear over the orchestra.
The soprano
hits a high note.
CATWALK
Buggy aims the rifle.
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE
Smoochy glides THROUGH the cross-hairs followed by a
Rhinette.
TIGHT ON BUGGY'S FINGER
as he quickly squeezes off a SHOT.
RINK
The MUFFLED sound of GUNSHOT is absorbed by the intense
music. A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice, but no one
notices. Smoochy, oblivious, continues to skate toward
the "gates of heaven" with the angel Moochy. Giant white
gates slowly swing open at the rink's far end as floating
angels open their arms to welcome Moochy.
OUTER RINK
Randolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get
Sheldon's attention. Cops and security push their way
towards Randolph. He suddenly notices the felled
Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward. He can make out
a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk.
NETWORK BOX
Stokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience.
They now see Randolph running through the crowd on his
way to the stairwell.
(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:
STOKES
(whispering to Burke)
What's he doing here?! He's going
to screw everything up!
Nora notices the distressed look on their faces and
follows their gaze to the rafters. She now sees the
rifle barrel.
ANGLE - NORA
jumps to her feet.
FAST PUSH IN TO Nora's mouth.
NORA
(screaming)
Sheldon!!!
She starts to climb out of the box but Burke stops her.
BURKE
Nora...
NORA
You're in on this, aren't you!
You sold him out! You fucking
snake!
Stokes tries to put his arm around her.
STOKES
Nora, please. It's not what you
think. I'm grooming you. You're
going to run the division one
day...
She pushes him. He goes down hard. She starts to climb
out of the box. Burke tries to grab her, but she spins
around and punches him. She runs for the rink.
Stokes stands in the box looking dumbstruck as pande-
monium plays out around him. People are running in all
directions, cops are everywhere.
STOKES
(frightened; to Burke)
What now? What do we do now?!
BURKE
Survival of the fittest!
Burke runs off through the panicked crowd. Stokes looks
around and heads off in the opposite direction.
114.
OUTSIDE RINK
Tommy and her boys notice the commotion in the audience.
They see cops pursuing someone. They realize it's
Randolph. Tommy, Jimmy and Sammy take off after him.
CATWALK
Buggy, in position again, looks through the rifle scope.
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE
As the soprano reaches for an impossibly high note, the
fog dissipates slightly and Smoochy's foam rubber head
COMES perfectly INTO VIEW.
BUGGY
smiles.
RINK'S EDGE
Nora screams.
NORA
Sheldon!!! Get down!!!
CLOSE ON BUGGY'S FINGER
He's about to squeeze the trigger.
CATWALK
Randolph reaches the catwalk as the orchestra plays a
dramatic series of smashing notes. He tackles Buggy just
as he squeezes off the SHOT.
RINK
The top of Smoochy's foam rubber head is blown off. In
SLOW MOTION, Smoochy's tattered horn sails through the
air and lands softly on the ice.
WIDE
Everyone in the arena screams and heads for the exits.
It's pandemonium. Thanks to Randolph, Buggy's shot was
too high and just missed Sheldon's skull.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
A confused Sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the
Smoochy head.
Nora, who's entered at the opposite end of the rink,
tries to reach him, but it's impossible. Panicked
audience members run across the rink, heading for the
exits. It's chaos. People slip, Rhinettes get trampled.
CATWALK
Randolph tries to get the rifle away from Buggy. They
struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink. The cops
have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now. Tommy
and the boys get there a second later. They all stand
back -- the catwalk is too unstable.
RANDOLPH
Give me that gun, you fucking
wacked-out freak!
Buggy manages to shove Randolph off him. He raises the
RIFLE and SHOOTS at the cops. Randolph grabs him. Both
he and Buggy lose their footing and slip from the
catwalk. Randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold
on. Buggy clutches Randolph's leg which threatens to
bring them both down. They dangle 80 feet above the
rink. Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the
catwalk as Buggy clings to Randolph's ankle.
CLOSE ON RANDOLPH'S FINGERS
His knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from
the beam.
ANGLE ON BUGGY
Still clutching Randolph's ankle, he starts to lose his
grip. He desperately grabs Randolph's foot, but
Randolph's shoe slips off and Buggy begins his long
plunge to the next life.
Buggy screams the whole way down, still holding onto
Randolph's shoe.
RINK
Buggy crashes into the middle of the rink, cob-webbing
the ice around him.
116.
CATWALK
Tommy and his boys runs off to find Sheldon. The COPS
help Randolph off the catwalk. He's a nervous wreck.
COP #1
You okay?
RANDOLPH
I don't know. I'm kind of fucked
up in general, so it's hard to
gauge.
They pat the dazed Randolph on the back.
He passes out.
RINK
People continue to run through the rink. Felled
Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls. Smoke fills
the air. Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet
as Nora finally reaches him. She embraces him.
NORA
Burke's with Stokes.
He's been in
it all along.
Sheldon looks toward the network box. Beyond it, through
the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people
who jam the exit trying to escape. Sheldon reaches into
his costume and pulls out his gun.
NORA
No, Sheldon, don't!
Sheldon runs off leaving Nora.
EXIT
Burke is almost through the cluster of people. He
glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading
toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally
gets through.
SUPERIMPOSE:
ONE YEAR LATER
The Garden is sold out.
The lights go down.
Through the
P.A. we hear...
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

There's a dramatic pause; TYMPANY ROLL.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Heeeeeere's Smoochy!
Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
With his partner and comrade...
the one, the only... Rainbow

Randolph skates out, somewhat shakily, to huge applause.
Sheldon puts his arm around him. The audience is now on
their feet. Randolph especially basks in the adulation.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
All proceeds from tonight's
performance, will benefit the
Rainbow Randolph Center for
Alcoholism and Delusional
Behavior.

Sheldon pats Randolph on the back. MUSIC BEGINS as
Rhinettes and Krinkle Kids skate out. The show starts
and the audience goes wild. Nora smiles from the stands
as Smoochy and the others glide across the ice. (SMOOCHY

FADE OUT.
