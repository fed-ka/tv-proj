      SUPER: BELORUS, THE PRESENT DAY

      Methos and Kronos ride on horseback through the ancient woods. 
      It looks like the middle of nowhere it is.

                                      METHOS
                    This is the place.

      Kronos scans the woods with a wary eye.  Then he turns and
      fixes Methos with a long, hard warning look.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    He's here, Kronos.  You don't think
                    I'd lie to you?

      Kronos holds his look for a moment longer, then a dark smile
      washes over his face.

                                      KRONOS
                    Do you do anything else?
                          (turning back to the
                            woods)
                    Where is he?

                                      METHOS
                    Not far.

      Methos turns and leads the way.

      As they ride closer, Kronos' enthusiasm grows.

                                      KRONOS
                    This is what I've dreamed of... every
                    night for over two thousand years.
                          (off Methos' look)
                    The four of us... reunited.

      Methos gives a sour look.

                                      METHOS
                          (to himself)
                    Certainly gives a new meaning to the
                    phrase Dream Team.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     2.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1201CONTINUED:1201

      Kronos pays no attention to Methos' murmurings.

                                      KRONOS
                    It will be like the old days.  Better. 
                    Whatever we want, we have...

                                      METHOS
                          (dry)
                    ... or take.

                                      KRONOS
                          (ignoring Methos 
                            tone)
                    That's the spirit.

      Methos and Kronos react to the sound of CHOPPING coming from
      the near distance.

      INSERT - A BLADE

      splitting a chunk of wood with expert precision.

      BACK TO SCENE

      An eager look lights Kronos' face.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    It's Silas... The man is a virtuoso.

      Again, the sound of an ax hitting wood reverberates through
      the forest.

      Methos stops, turns to Kronos.  Serious.

                                      METHOS
                    He's been here a thousand years.  He
                    may not even remember us.

                                      KRONOS
                    He'll remember.  What we were, you
                    don't forget.

                                      METHOS
                    What happens if he won't come along?

      Kronos is all smug self-assurance.

                                      KRONOS
                    He'll come... or he'll die.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - SILAS THE MAGYAR

      In a small clearing, SILAS THE MAGYAR (Charles Bronson at
      40) is chopping wood rhythmically, sweat running down the
      muscles of his back.  In mid-swing, Silas gets the BUZZ.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     3.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1201CONTINUED: (2)1201

      Surprised and alert, he stops his chopping, hefts the AX at
      the ready, and turns to see Methos and Kronos, now walking
      their horses, approaching.

      Silas throws the ax.  It lands with a loud thunk in the tree
      between Methos and Kronos.  Silas measures them in deadly
      silence for a long beat.  Then a broad grin comes over his
      face.

                                      SILAS
                    Brothers!

                                      KRONOS
                    Guess he remembers.

      Silas reaches his old friends, embraces Methos in a bear hug
      that lifts him off the ground, squeezing the breath out of
      him.

                                      METHOS
                    Nice to see you too, Silas.

      Silas puts Methos down.

                                      SILAS
                    We ride?

                                      METHOS
                    We ride.

12031203INT.  JOE'S - DAY (VANCOUVER PRESHOOT)

      MACLEOD and DAWSON are leaning against the bar as CASSANDRA
      sits at a nearby table in front of Dawson's LAPTOP.  She's
      paging through the files of Immortal after Immortal from the
      Watcher Database.  Their images flip by.

                                      DAWSON
                    You really think the other Horsemen
                    could still be alive?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Methos and Kronos are.  Under
                    different names, different lives.

      Cassandra pushes the laptop away from her impatiently.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    This is pointless.  We're wasting
                    time.  Let's just go find Kronos.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Starting where?

                    If they are alive, that's where he'll
                    be going.

                                      DAWSON
                    I've narrowed the search down to
                    white, male Immortals we don't have
                    First Death information on.
                          (beat)
                    It's still a helluva lot of files.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Try narrowing it down by name.  Look
                    for something similar to what they
                    were using then.  Caspian and Silas.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're reaching.

                          (short)
                    Just try it, okay?

      He catches himself and, as an apology:

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, Joe.  It's worth a shot.

      Dawson hits a few keys on the laptop and a few names and
      pictures appear.

                                      DAWSON
                    Andrew Kaspis.

                            head)
                    Evan Casparri.

      As EVAN CASPARRI appears on the screen, a paleness washes
      over Cassandra's face.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (in a tiny voice)
                    That's him.... that's Caspian.

                    He's in Romania.  Just outside

      MacLeod turns from the laptop screen to see that Cassandra
      is already half way out the door.

      SUPER: ROMANIA

12051205INT.  ASYLUM - RECEPTION - NIGHT

      Methos and Kronos are standing at the reception desk talking
      to DR. CERNAVODA, the asylum's administrator.  Silas stands
      there, mute.  Dr. Cernavoda is studying some official-looking
      documents.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    This is a highly irregular request. 
                    It will take weeks, perhaps months.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     6.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1205CONTINUED:1205

                                      METHOS
                    We'd like him...
                          (beat)
                    Now.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    We have procedures, gentlemen.
                          (gently chiding)
                    Patience is a virtue.
                          (beat)
                    I'm afraid my hands are tied.

                                      KRONOS
                          (leaning in close)
                    Perhaps this could help untie them.

      Kronos pulls out a thick envelope and hands it to Dr.
      Cernavoda.  As Dr. Cernavoda opens it and looks inside --

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                      Twenty-five thousand dollars...
                    U.S.
                          (persuasive smile)
                    Now it seems to me you have a
                      "procedural" choice to make, Doctor. 
                    Forget your impeccable paperwork and
                    I give you twenty-five thousand
                    dollars and you give me Casparri, or
                    you keep Casparri and lose everything.
                          (beat; with implied
                            danger)
                    I do mean everything.

      It's an easy choice.  The Doctor nods and puts the envelope
      inside his smock.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    This way.
                          (beat)
                      Gentlemen.

12061206INT.  ASYLUM - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

      The place is decaying, a warehouse of the unfortunate.  The
      corridors are lined with barred doors, some open, but most
      are closed and locked.

      As Dr. Cernavoda leads Methos, Kronos, and Silas through the
      corridors, some of the inmates watch them through eyes full
      of sedation.  Others, through eyes full of madness.  Some
      reach out through barred doors.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    What are you going to do with

                      Rehabilitate him.

      Dr. Cernavoda laughs.  The others don't.  Cernavoda looks at
      them curiously.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    You're serious?
                          (peering at Kronos)
                    You can't be serious.

                                      METHOS
                    Why?
                          (genuinely curious)
                    What did he do?

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    No one knows how many he killed. 
                    They found parts in his garden, in
                    his basement...
                          (a shudder)
                    In his freezer.

                                      METHOS
                    I'm surprised he wasn't executed.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    In a less progressive age, a man
                    like this would have been.
                          (beat)

      ANGLE - ONE OF THE INMATES

      He's dressed in a ragged black gown.  He points in horror as
      he sees Kronos.

                                      INMATE
                    He's here!  The Dark One is here!
                          (points a craggy finger
                          at Kronos)
                    It's you!  It's the END!

      Kronos fixes the inmate with a dark smile.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                          (to Kronos)
                    Pay no attention.  He's harmless. 
                    He's been saying that for thirty
                    years.

                                      KRONOS
                    One day he may be right.

                    And one day Romania will be a
                      superpower.

      Dr. Cernavoda stops at a heavily barred room.

      ANGLE - CASPARRI'S ROOM

      Caspian is chained to the stone wall.  He's doing rapid push
      ups, arm-chains rattling and clanging.  He's matted and
      filthy.  As he gets the BUZZ, he goes into a feral crouch.

                                      METHOS
                    Very humane.

      Dr. Cernavoda gives Methos a sardonic look.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    I don't know what you want him for,
                    but believe me...
                          (beat)
                    This one is better off dead.

                    Open the door.

      After a look from Kronos, Silas stands vigil in the hallway.

      As Cernavoda turns a key in the lock and opens the door --

12071207INT.  ASYLUM - CASPARRI'S ROOM - NIGHT

      The door opens and Caspian springs forward, but is brought
      up short by his chain, like a lunging dog.  He falls back
      against the wall, panting and snarling.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    Are you sure you don't want to
                    consider another candidate?

                                      KRONOS
                    Unchain him.

      Caspian lunges again.

                                    DR. CERNAVODA
                    Perhaps we should call security.

      Kronos' sword is out in an instant.  The chain is severed in
      a single blow.  Suddenly Caspian lunges and grasps the
      Doctor's throat in a powerful death grip.

      As Cernavoda struggles, trying to pry Caspian's fingers from
      his throat, Kronos looks on with something akin to amusement.

                                      KRONOS
                    And I thought you valued patience.

      There's a beat.  Kronos locks eyes with Caspian.  Caspian
      smiles and Cernavoda dies.  (NOTE: Please make sure we have
      Methos' reaction so that we can be on him as Cernavoda is
      killed for the European version.)

      As Cernavoda crumbles to the ground, Kronos takes the cash
      from his pocket.  A smile of mad delight spreads over
      Caspian's face --

      Methos steps forward.

                                      CASPIAN
                    Stop!

      Methos stops.  Caspian reaches down where Methos was about
      to step.  There is a large black bug.  He picks it up and
      pops it in his mouth.

                                      CASPIAN (CONT'D)
                    They're better alive.

                                      METHOS

                    Come, we have much to do.

      Kronos and Caspian move out of the cell.  Methos lingers a
      moment.  We see that SOMETHING SMALL falls from Methos  hand. 
      Methos doesn't pick it up.  He gives the room one last glance
      and heads out the grated door, pulling it closed hard behind
      him.

      MacLeod and Cassandra are at the reception desk in
        conversation with a distraught NURSE.  A gurney is wheeling
      out the dead Dr. Cernavoda.

                                      NURSE
                    Some time last night.  We found the
                    doctor this morning.

                    Did Casparri have any visitors
                      yesterday?

      The Nurse picks up a chart.

                                      NURSE
                    No... there's nothing on his chart.

      The Nurse looks up and sees TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMEN
        approaching.

                                      NURSE (CONT'D)
                    Excuse me.

      She walks off toward the police.  MacLeod lifts up the chart
      and moves down the corridor.  Cassandra hesitates.

                                      MACLEOD

      MacLeod opens the door to Casparri s room.  Cassandra is
      clearly irritated.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Kronos and Methos already have him. 
                    Why are we wasting time in this
                    hellhole?

      MacLeod is silent, looks around.  He picks up the severed
      chain and studies  it.

      Drops it, and then his eye catches something small in the
      folds of the chain.  He picks it up.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Here's why.

                    The question is why.

      The WAR ROOM is a huge hall, nearly empty except for a wooden
      table set at the center.  Around the table sit Methos and
      Caspian.  Caspian s been cleaned up but still has a wild
      animal look to him.  Silas enters.

                                      SILAS
                    What the hell is this place?  Where
                    are the stables?  Where are the
                    horses?  How can we ride?

                                      CASPIAN
                    Where ve you been for two thousand
                    years, Silas?  Living in a cave?
                          (with a mocking laugh)
                    You think we can just mount up and
                    gallop down Broadway?

                    Right.  Four guys on Horseback in
                    wild masks -- they'll think we're in
                    the circus.

                          (his hand on his ax)
                    They won't think it for long.

                    You're crazy.  You should have been
                    in the madhouse instead of me.

                                      SILAS
                    Keep laughing, I'll send you back
                    there headless.

      Caspian is up to the challenge, rises, drawing his sword as
      he does.  Silas is on his feet, ax ready.

      From his seat, Methos seems to be enjoying this well enough.

      Kronos enters, his sword in hand.

                    Put them down.

      They hesitate.  Suddenly the sword slams down into the wooden
      table, shaking it.

      Inside a large room is filled with cages.  Most are empty,
      but many contain MONKEYS.  The Horsemen enter.  The monkeys
      chatter.

                                      KRONOS
                    The weapons of today are different,
                    but it all comes down to the same
                    thing.  There are the conquerers and
                    there are the conquered.

      Kronos opens a small insulated container.  With a pair of
      tongs he removes a vial.

                    I have a few thoughts.  A few dollars. 
                    Enough to start.

                    What did you have in mind?

                                      KRONOS
                    Once we rode out of the sun, bringing
                    death at the point of a sword.  There
                    was no man, and no Immortal, who
                    could stand before us.  We were death
                    on horseback.  They called us the
                    end of the world.

      Kronos' eyes are manic as he rakes them over his compatriots.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                      Gentlemen, I want to give them what

12131213INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - WAR ROOM - DAY - LATER

      Mid-scene.  Methos sits with his feet up on the table, a
      study in casualness.  Silas leans on the wall nearby while
      Caspian is doing pushups, showing off.  Kronos paces in front
      of Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    That's it?  A bomb with the virus in
                      a fountain?  How many will that kill?
                          (beat)
                    You've gone soft, Methos.

                                      CASPIAN
                          (with sarcasm)
                    I'm scared...
                          (to Silas)
                    Are you scared?

                                      METHOS
                    It's a beginning.  Haven't you read
                      Aristotle's Poetics?
                          (off Caspian's look)
                    Of course not.  Don't suppose you've
                    seen "Casablanca," either.
                          (with a sigh)
                    It's the first rule of great drama. 
                    Start small, and build.
                          (beat)
                      A fountain... to get their attention. 
                    Then a public pool, to kill a hundred. 
                    Then a stadium to kill ten thousand. 
                    Then an ounce of this in a city's
                    water supply and in a week...

      Methos' voice trails off.

                                      KRONOS
                          (liking it)
                    The city is dead.

                                      METHOS
                    You want to own the world again? 
                    You offer them the choice -- the
                    Horsemen rule, or they all die.

      Kronos smiles.

      An Innkeeper stands behind the front desk.  MacLeod turns
      from him, moves to Cassandra.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No message, no reservation, nothing.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He left that note, he'll get in touch.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He's done nothing but lie to you. 
                    That's all he ever does.

      MacLeod doesn't answer her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'll get us a room.

      MacLeod turns back to the front desk.

1215A1215AEXT.  INN - MACLEOD'S BALCONY - DAY

      MacLeod and Cassandra are in mid-conversation on the balcony
      overlooking the city.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He's not your friend.  He's no one's

                    me take care of him, then we'll worry
                    about the rest.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Kill Kronos, you cut out the heart
                    of the Horsemen.  Kill Methos, you
                    take the head.  They both have to
                    die.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Even if you have your revenge, the

      As he takes her into his arms.

12161216INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - LAB - DAY

      Silas is feeding one of the monkeys through the cage door. 
      He's smiling as it takes food from his hand.  The monkeys
      CHATTER suddenly.  He looks for the source of agitation. 
      It's Methos passing by the door.

                                      SILAS
                    Methos?  You seem troubled.

                                      METHOS
                          (entering)
                    No, I was just thinking.

                                      SILAS
                    You were always good at that.
                          (beat)
                    I m glad after all these years that
                    you still are.

                                      METHOS
                    Me, too.

      Silas smiles.  He offers Methos a half-pint of an amber
      liquor.

                                      SILAS
                    Not like the old days, is it?

      Methos takes a swig hands it back.

                                      SILAS
                    We were meant for battle, men like
                    us.  In an age of warlords, we were
                    kings.
                          (beat)
                    I don't like killing from a distance. 
                    I like to have my ax in my hand, to
                    see my enemies' eyes before I strike.

                                      METHOS
                    Soon enough.

                    Oh, it'll work.
                          (beat)
                    We'll kill a hundred, then a thousand,

                    what he wants.
                          (beat)
                    He'll destroy half the world and
                    rule the rest.

                                      SILAS
                    We will rule.  We four.

      He hands Methos the bottle again.  Methos takes it, holds it
      without drinking for a beat.  Then:

                                      METHOS
                    Silas... For two thousand years we've
                    lived without it.  The blood, the
                    fear, the power.

                                      SILAS
                    And for two thousand years I've hoped
                    for the day we would ride again.

                    Like you always said.  We live.  We
                    grow stronger.  And then we fight.

      A beat of silence from Methos.  Then he takes a final swig
      and hands the bottle back.

                                      METHOS
                    I'll see you later.

      He turns to leave.  Silas calls after him.

                    Do you think he'll let me have one?

                                      METHOS
                    Have what?

                                      SILAS
                    A monkey.  I like this one.

                                      METHOS
                    I'll ask him for you.

                    If I have to.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You will.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did it ever occur to you that he
                    might be trying to help us?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    No.

      The phone RINGS.  MacLeod grabs the phone.

                                      MACLEOD

12181218EXT.  DARK STREET - NIGHT

      Methos is standing in the shadows, phone to his ear.

                                      METHOS
                    Elysium Church.  Ten minutes.  Come
                    alone.

      And then click as he folds his phone closed.

12191219INT.  INN - MACLEOD'S ROOM - RESUME

      As MacLeod schools his face, answers casually into the now
      dead phone --

                                      MACLEOD
                          (into phone)
                    I'll be right down.

      Cassandra is acutely alert.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Was that him?

                                      MACLEOD
                    No, just the front desk -- some
                    problem with my credit card.

      As MacLeod heads out the door, Cassandra moves to the mirror,
      sits in front of it.  As she gazes with a thousand yard stare
      at her reflection --

12201220INT.  CHURCH - DUSK

      Methos stands dead still in the nave of the church.  He
      reacts, edgy and tense, to the BUZZ as MacLeod arrives. 
      MacLeod is chilly.  The two men hold each other's eyes for a
      long moment, then --

                                      MACLEOD
                    Well? I'm here.

                                      METHOS
                    Yes... thanks.

      MacLeod tightens.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why did you lie to me?

                                      METHOS
                    About what?

1220CONTINUED:1220

                                      MACLEOD
                    About Cassandra.  About what you
                    were.

                                      METHOS
                    I was many things.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who are you now?

      MacLeod gives him a tired look.  Methos moves closer to
      MacLeod, edgy.

                                      METHOS
                    Why do you think I didn't tell you? 
                    I know you, MacLeod.  I knew how you
                    would react.

      Methos gives a shake of the head, a mirthless laugh.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    What I've done, you don't forgive.
                    Not in your nature.
                          (beat)
                    Just accept it.

      But MacLeod just can't let it go.  He grabs Methos by the
      arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Accept what?  That a friend I trusted
                    with my life slaughtered innocent
                    people for a few head of cattle?
                          (beat)
                    What are you going to tell me, Methos? 
                    That that's how the world was?

      Methos acknowledges a fundamental truth.

                                      METHOS
                    The world was how we made it.

      Methos turns to the altar.  After a beat:

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    She told you we burned her village,
                      slaughtered her people.

                                      MACLEOD
                    And took her prisoner.

      Methos waits for MacLeod to continue.  When MacLeod doesn't,
      he turns back to MacLeod.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     22.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

      When it's clear MacLeod doesn't have anything further to
      add, Methos shakes his head sadly.

                                      METHOS
                    There's more.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

12211221EXT.  THE HORSEMEN'S BLUFF SIDE CAMP - THE BRONZE AGE - DAY

      SUPER: THE BRONZE AGE

      A few pavilions on bluffs by the sea.  (NOTE: A different
      location than the Horsemen's Camp in Ep. 96511)

      The Four Horsemen ride in, fresh from battle, blood on their
      swords and on their leather armor.  They've brought booty
      back to their camp with them, including a few frightened
      captive women.

      Silas and Caspian, flushed with the charge of battle, strip
      off masks and armor and wash off the day's dust and gore in
      a small stream.  Kronos looks on, the proud leader.  He turns
      to Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    Another day well spent.  Come, Methos,
                    let's celebrate.

      With a grin, Kronos looks over at the cowering captive women.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    And divide our bounty.

                                      METHOS
                    You can have my share.  I'm tired.

      Methos nods good night, then turns and heads for his pavilion. 
      Kronos looks after him thoughtfully.

12221222INT.  METHOS' PAVILION - THE BRONZE AGE - DAY

      Methos enters tiredly.  Cassandra rises from the shadows and
      comes to him.  It's a different Cassandra than we have seen
      in the other Flashbacks.  She's calm, submissive, dressed
        seductively.

      She carries a brass goblet.  He takes it from her and takes
      a deep swallow.

                                      METHOS
                          (re the wine)
                    It's good.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     23.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1222CONTINUED:1222

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I cooled it in the river.

      She takes his cloak and his sword, puts them aside, then
      reaches to unbuckle his leather armor.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (re his dusty state)
                    You rode far.

      He sighs tiredly as the armor comes off.

                                      METHOS
                    Yes.

      He settles back on the cushions as Cassandra gently washes
      off the mud and blood of the field, anointing his body with
      exotic oils.

      He draws her closer and begins to caress her gently.  As he
      starts to remove her gown --

      The flap of the tent is flung open.  Kronos steps into the
      tent.

      Cassandra hastily pulls her robe closed, flushing under
      Kronos' hungry stare.  With a smile, Kronos turns to Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    My compliments, brother.  You've
                    taught her well in everything, I
                    see.

      Methos's face is inscrutable.

                                      METHOS
                    She had much to learn.

      Kronos reaches into a fruit bowl.  Takes a large bite.

                                      KRONOS
                    Seems she keeps the best fruit for
                    you.

                                      METHOS
                    It's the same as any.

      Kronos is taking in Cassandra with his eyes --

                                      KRONOS
                    Maybe it just tastes better in here.
                          (moves closer to
                            Cassandra)
                    You've made quite a prize of her.

1222CONTINUED: (2)1222

                                      METHOS
                    She's no different than any of the
                    others.

                                      KRONOS
                    Except you seem to prefer her to all
                    others.  Why is that?  Have you grown
                    attached?

                                      METHOS
                    No.

                                      KRONOS
                    Good.  I didn't think you'd make a
                    mistake like that, brother.
                          (beat)
                    Because now it's time to share the
                    spoils of war.

      Cassandra retreats behind Methos, expecting him to defend
      her, to refuse Kronos' demand.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Methos... send him away.

      Kronos laughs and moves closer.

                                      KRONOS
                    You've left some spirit in her,
                    Methos.  I like that... After I
                    finish, maybe I'll let Caspian have
                    her.

      Kronos reaches and grabs Cassandra and pulls her from behind
      Methos.  Methos doesn't help or hinder Kronos, but merely
      steps aside and lets him take hold of Cassandra.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (in shock and terror)
                    Methos!

      No reaction.

      Cassandra screams and struggles as Kronos drags her out of
      the tent.  Her face is washed with terror and betrayal.

      HOLD ON Methos as he stares after them for a beat, face
      unreadable.  Then, as he takes a piece of fruit, and rolls
      it over in his hand --

1222A1222AEXT.  THE HORSEMEN'S CAMP - THE BRONZE AGE - DAY

      Kronos drags the unwilling Cassandra to his tent.  He throws
      her down.  Through the translucent tent wall we see Kronos
      standing over her.

      The CAMERA PANS to the sky and night falls.

1222B1222BINT.  KRONOS  PAVILION - THE BRONZE AGE - NIGHT (FORMERLY
      1229)

      The pavilion is similar in size and design to Methos 
      pavilion, but it's in disorder.  Skins and various pieces of
      booty are scattered helter-skelter throughout the pavilion.

      Cassandra is thrust inside.  Kronos stands over her.

                                      KRONOS
                    Show me again what you've learned...

      Kronos begins to open his shirt.  Cassandra shrinks back
      into a corner of the pavilion, terrified.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    No more.  I'd rather die.

                                      KRONOS
                    A little death is always at the heart
                    of passion.

      Kronos grabs Cassandra and pulls her close into him.  She
      lashes out at him, striking him hard across the face.  Without
      flinching, he throws her to the ground.

      He approaches her again.  She puts up her hands in
      supplication.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Please, don't hurt me.

      Kronos steps back and begins to untie the sash that holds up
      his trousers.

                                      KRONOS
                    Smart girl.

      Kronos smiles.  Cassandra moves closer, places her hands on
      his hips, unties the sash.  Rather than just remove his
      trousers, she takes her time, moving her hands over his lower
      abdomen, teasingly seductive.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                          (groaning with pleasure)
                    Maybe I won't give you to Caspian
                    after all.

      Cassandra keeps caressing Kronos, moving lower.  Kronos closes
      his eyes with pleasure.

      Cassandra glances up, then in a quick fluid motion pulls a
      sharp KNIFE from her skirts.  The blade flashes.

      We are on Kronos' face as it contorts in pain.  Kronos
      staggers back.  The blade is in his chest.  He staggers and
      falls.

      Cassandra pushes past him and rushes out of the pavilion.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

                    She escaped across the wilderness. 
                    She must have died a dozen times of
                    heat and thirst before she reached a
                    village that would take her in.
                          (beat)
                    And I'm sure it was worth it.  Getting
                    away from us, from me.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So what the hell are you doing with
                    Kronos now?

                                      METHOS

      Again Methos gives a mirthless laugh.

                    That's not a choice you have.  You
                    can't stop him, I can't stop him --

                    effect will be the same.  A world of

                                      METHOS
                    Yes.  Perhaps I do.

                    What if I told you I came here to

                    There won't be many people there

      MacLeod stares at him a beat.  He's looking at a stranger.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You set a bomb?!

                                      METHOS
                    You've heard of Ebola.  There are
                    worse things in the world if you
                    look for them.
                          (beat)
                    Kronos looked.  He's breeding a virus. 
                    He's got cages of monkeys and enough
                    virus to destroy half of Europe.

      He tries to move Methos out.  Methos pulls his arm away.

                                      METHOS
                    If I turn against him...

                    Then why are you here?  What game
                    are you playing now, Methos?

      Methos shrugs.

                                      METHOS
                          (beat)
                    It's in the center of the fountain. 
                    Blue, then green, then red.

      MacLeod hesitates.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're better than this.

                                      METHOS
                          (off his watch)
                    You've got twenty-four minutes.

      MacLeod holds his gaze for a moment, then turns and leaves.

12241224INT.  INN - MACLEOD S ROOM - NIGHT

      Cassandra paces tensely.  Then she gets the BUZZ.  She turns
      toward it, off guard, expecting MacLeod.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Duncan, what took you so long?

      But it's Kronos.

                                      KRONOS
                    I m afraid MacLeod is otherwise
                    engaged.

      Kronos steps into the room.  Right behind him are Caspian
      and Silas.

      Kronos moves toward Cassandra.

                    As I remember, I owe you something.

      Kronos' face has a look of grim satisfaction.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Too bad you didn't know you had to
                    take my head to kill me.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'll take it now!

      As Cassandra moves to pull out her SWORD, Kronos tears it
      from her grasp.

      He takes out a KNIFE just like the one she stabbed him with
      in his pavilion ages ago.

                                      KRONOS
                    I've waited a long time to give this
                    back to you.

      As Cassandra backs away from the blade.

12251225EXT.  FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

      MacLeod approaches the fountain.  A few people mill about.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Go... get out of here!

      They disperse as if he s crazy.

      MacLeod searches the fountain, finds a METAL BOX.  He slides
      it out carefully.

      THE BOMB

      has a timer on it and colored wires.  The timer reads
      02:58.52.

      MACLEOD

      has sixty seconds.  He has time.

      He pulls out a swiss army knife, starts to reach for the
      blue wire.  Cuts it.  Then a WHINING noise.  He reacts.

      The water from the fountain starts to spray.  He's getting
      soaked, but he relaxes.  Then --

      A LOUD CLICK

      from inside the metal casing.  MacLeod cuts the green wire. 
      Ten seconds to go.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96512    "Revelation 6:8"     30.    Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

      He picks up the small tube of virus.  As he stares at it,
      knowing what could have happened.

12311231INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

      Kronos has a map of the world laid out on the table.  He
      looks up and sees

      METHOS

      entering the room.

                                      KRONOS
                    We missed you.

                    Your bomb didn't go off.  Not much

                                      METHOS
                    I'll think of better.

                                      KRONOS
                    I'm sure you will, or I'll just have
                    to improvise.
                          (beat; casual)
                    By the way, where were you?

                                      METHOS
                    I was just...

                                      KRONOS

                            fact)
                    Warning your friend.

      Methos doesn't allow a reaction.  Kronos sighs and gives
      Methos a patronizing look.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Did you believe I wouldn't know you'd
                    tell MacLeod?

                                      METHOS
                    It's not like you think.

                                      KRONOS
                    It's exactly like I think.

      Methos is silent.  Kronos fixes him with a cold smile.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    My dearest brother, that's what makes
                    you my perfect right arm -- we think
                    alike, we always have.

                                      METHOS
                    I doubt that.  Nobody thinks like
                    you Kronos.

      Kronos laughs.

                                      KRONOS
                    The answer of a true scholar.

      Kronos turns his attention back to his map and a small device
      that looks like a cross between a detonator and a cell phone.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    See this?  Isn't it beautiful?  All
                    I do is punch in a few numbers and a
                    small vial explodes in the reservoir
                    above Bordeaux.  And then... Well,
                    you know what happens then.
                          (beat)
                    We all make our own little plans.

                    I know you won t disappoint me.
                          (expansive)
                    I forgive you already.  Come... I
                    have something else to show you.

      Methos follows Kronos across the room and down a hallway.

12321232INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Kronos stops at a barred room --

                                      KRONOS
                    She was asking about you.

      Methos looks into the barred room to see --

12331233INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - BARRED ROOM - NIGHT

      Cassandra is locked inside, lying on a mat, tied up and
        unconscious.

12341234INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Methos' expression is locked down as he stares in at
      Cassandra.

      Kronos throws an arm over his shoulders, brotherly.

                                      KRONOS
                    What are you thinking now?  How you're
                    going to get out of here to tell

                    You're not.  Look around.  This place
                    is your whole world now, Methos.

                                      METHOS
                    You mistake me.

                                      KRONOS
                    Try to leave, and the minute I sense
                    you're gone, she dies.

                                      METHOS
                    Why would I care?

      But he can't keep the rage and frustration out of his eyes.

                                      KRONOS
                    You can't out-think me, Methos, and
                    you can't out-fight me.  And you
                    sure as hell can't kill me.

                                      METHOS
                          (murmurs)
                    You think so.

                                      KRONOS
                    You had your shot and you couldn't
                    take it.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

      SUPER: ANCIENT GREECE

      Methos looks at a dead Greek as Kronos rifles the body of
      another.

                                      KRONOS
                    Methos the scholar?  That's a good
                    one, brother.

      Kronos laughs incredulously, but Methos is serious.

                                      METHOS
                    I'm serious.  It's what I want to

                    About the world.  About myself. 
                    About who we are.

                                      KRONOS
                    I can tell you who we are.

                    Can you?

                                      KRONOS
                    I'm Kronos.  I always have been, and
                    I always will be.  And you're just
                    like me.  We are who we are, and
                    that's more than enough.

                                      METHOS
                    Not for me.  Those who don't learn
                    from their mistakes, repeat them.

                                      KRONOS
                    We don't make mistakes.  We make
                    history.

      Kronos drains his goblet of wine.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Pour me another drink and have one
                    yourself.  You're getting too damned
                    serious for your own good.  You're
                    turning into a Greek.

      Methos pours Kronos more wine, and in a life-defining moment,
      slips in some poison from a ring.

                                      METHOS
                    Thank you.

      Methos hands him the wine.  Kronos drains it.

                                      KRONOS
                          (a slow warning tone)
                    Just be careful you don't forget
                    what you really are.

                                      METHOS
                    I never forget what I am.  The more
                    I learn, the more aware I become.

      Methos stands.

                    you.
                          (a long beat)
                    I'm finished riding with you.

                                      KRONOS
                    The hell you are!  Sit down!

      Methos doesn't.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Don't make me say it again.

                                      METHOS
                    You don't need me.

                    There are four Horsemen.  There always
                    will be.

                                      KRONOS
                      Impossible.  We four are brothers. 
                    The blood we spill binds us, only
                    blood can separate us.

      Methos doesn't move.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                          (pleasant)
                    Don't you understand, Methos?  The
                    only way to leave the Horseman...
                          (cold)
                    Is by leaving your head.

      Methos shakes his head sadly.

                                      METHOS
                    I was afraid you might see it that
                    way.

      Kronos stands and draws his sword, making ready to force
      Methos into a fight.  Methos draws his sword, steps back.

                                      KRONOS
                    Fight me, and don't think you'll
                    live to learn anything from it.

      As Kronos steps forward, he wavers on his feet, vision
      blurring, swordarm dropping.

                                      METHOS
                    A little something I came across in
                    my studies.  That potion would kill
                    most people.
                          (beat)
                    It will stop even you.

      Kronos makes one last effort, but the drugged wine takes
      hold, sending convulsions through Kronos.  He falls to the
      ground, out cold.

      Methos moves to Kronos' side, stands over him, deep in thought
      for a long beat, sword gripped firmly in his hands --

12361236EXT.  MYCENAE - ANCIENT GREECE - DAY

      Methos is pounding in the hinges on the grate that covers
      the well from which we saw Kronos escape at the beginning of
      the previous episode.

                                      KRONOS
                    Traitor!  Coward!  Fight me!

      He grabs at Methos through the bars.

                                      METHOS
                    Why would I do that?  I've already
                    beaten you.

                                      KRONOS
                    The hell you have!  Your head is
                    mine!  Your life is mine!

      Methos makes no answer -- just slams the massive bolt home.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

12371237INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - WAR ROOM - THE PRESENT - NIGHT

      The massive, ancient, rusted bolt that held Kronos in his
      prison.  He tosses the bolt onto the table in front of Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    So you had your thousand years of
                    study, while I had a thousand years
                    of crusts of bread flung to me by
                    the priests you left.

      Kronos' tone is pleasant, but the undercurrent is dangerous.

                    You're not MacLeod.

                    He's known you a few years.  I've
                    known you a thousand times as long.

      Kronos moves closer.

                          (beat)
                    I knew you'd send MacLeod to the
                    fountain.  And you knew I knew.
                          (beat)
                    So I did what you expected.  I went
                    and got the witch while she was
                      unprotected.

                          (beat)
                    Then you do know me better than I
                    know myself.

                                      KRONOS
                    Of course I do.  Your plan was
                    perfect.  Your plans always are.

                                      METHOS
                    Then there's nothing left to do but
                    kill MacLeod before he comes after
                    me.

      Methos turns to go.  Kronos stops him.

12381238EXT.  INN - NIGHT

      MacLeod approaches and gets the BUZZ.  His sword is out.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra?

      He turns, just as an AX bears down on him hard.

                                      SILAS
                    Welcome home.

      With a lightning motion, MacLeod just barely manages to
      deflect the attack as

      CASPIAN

      charges him from the other direction.

      MacLeod sidesteps Caspian's charge, deflecting Caspian's
      sword, but getting knocked back, a bit off balance, by the
      sheer power of Caspian's charge.

      As MacLeod scrambles to regain his balance, Silas approaches.

      MacLeod's options are dwindling fast -- he's got Horsemen on
      two sides, and even if he defeats one...

                                      CASPIAN (CONT'D)
                          (wild)

                    And when I kill one of you, the other
                    takes my head.

                                      SILAS

      With a blood curdling ancient battle-yell, Caspian charges,
      only to be met with a hard boot to the stomach.

      MacLeod slips past him and takes off.

      Silas and Caspian exchange a glance.

                                      CASPIAN
                    Just like old times.

12411241EXT.  DESERTED STREET - NIGHT

      MacLeod's on the run.  Silas and Caspian split up to search.

12421242EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

      MacLeod is crossing the bridge when he hears another battle-
      yell.  He turns to see Caspian charge at him, hard and
      furious.

      Caspian's first charge knocks MacLeod hard against the side
      of the bridge.  He recovers just in time to dodge Caspian's
      next blow.

      MacLeod is hard-pressed to counter Caspian's undisciplined
      fighting style.

      The madman has little finesse but he's relentless.

                                      CASPIAN
                    It's been a long time, Highlander.
                          (licking his lips)
                    You're gonna taste so good.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're gonna go hungry.

      MacLeod backs away from the onslaught of Caspian's almost
      incessantly swinging sword.  He's noting the pattern of the
      swings and timing them.

      Suddenly, MacLeod takes a quick sidestep, and in the same
      motion swings at Caspian's head.

      MacLeod's sword hits its mark.  Caspian falls hard to the
      ground, headless.

      As the Quickening drives MacLeod to his knees --

      SILAS

      is just striding toward him from the end of the bridge, ax
      raised.

      The wind from the Quickening strikes but Silas fights against
      it, approaching MacLeod, ready to kill him while he's down.

      MACLEOD S POV

      Through the wind and light, Silas looms closer.  He swings
      the ax.

      ON MACLEOD

      Before the ax hits its mark, MacLeod manages to roll off the
      bridge, even as the Quickening engulfs him, and disappears
      under water in the center of a whirlpool of wind and
      lightning.

      SILAS

      stands on the bridge, watching.  Ready.

      The water calms.  He looks... nothing.

                    You should eat.

      She spits at him.  He shakes his head sadly.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    This is familiar.

      Cassandra's white with hatred and fear.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'm not your sorry little slave
                    anymore.  I know what I am now. 
                    What you are.
                          (beat)
                    You may have fooled MacLeod, but
                    you've never fooled me.

                                      METHOS
                    I wasn't trying to fool anyone.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    If MacLeod knew what you really were,
                    he would have taken your head long
                    ago.

                                      METHOS
                    He had his chance.  He didn't.

      He studies her thoughtfully, not angry, not apologetic.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    It wasn't all bad.  When we were
                    together.

      She looks at him a beat, then looks away.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I only served you because you forced
                    me.

                                      METHOS
                    Don't hate yourself.
                          (shrugs)
                    It happens.  Look at Patty Hearst. 
                    It's called Stockholm Syndrome. 
                    Hostages come to rely on their captors
                    for life, for food, for approval --
                    and they fall in love.

      Cassandra fixes him with a look of contempt.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I never loved you.

                                      METHOS
                    But you thought you did.  You thought
                    I would protect you.
                          (beat)
                    You forgot what I was.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Untie me, you'll see how much I
                    remember.  I'll take your head with
                    my bare hands.  You, then Kronos.

                                      METHOS
                    Then you're stronger than I am.
                          (beat)
                    I had my chance at Kronos, and
                    couldn't strike.

      She hisses at him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'll strike.

                                      METHOS
                    Whatever.
                          (beat)
                    Love me or hate me, it doesn't matter
                    now.  It's Kronos who has the power.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Because you give it to him.  Like
                    always.

                                      METHOS
                    I've seen what happens to anyone who
                    goes up against him.
                          (beat)
                    If we want to survive, we'll keep
                    him happy.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I didn't then, and I won't now.  I'd
                    rather die.

                                      METHOS
                    Then you'll die.

      He grabs her arms, intense, forces her to meet his gaze.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    And you can forget about MacLeod
                    coming.
                          (beat)
                    He's dead.

      And off that --

12451245EXT.  PET STORE - DAY

      MacLeod approaches the store as the owner closes for lunch. 
      In the window are cages of different animals, including
      monkeys.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Monsieur, If I wanted to import a
                    hundred monkeys, who would I talk
                    to?

      As the owner smiles at the thought.

12461246INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - NIGHT                              

      Kronos is furious as he stands facing Silas.

                                      KRONOS
                    He killed Caspian and you just let
                    him get away!

                                      SILAS
                      I searched the river.  I searched
                    for hours.
                          (beat)
                    I found this.

      He holds out Caspian's SWORD.  Kronos looks at it a beat,
      then takes it.

                                      KRONOS
                    I will mourn him.
                            (devastated)
                    Never again will we be four.

                                      SILAS
                    I'll go back out.

                                      KRONOS
                    No.  Come with me.

      He storms toward Cassandra's room.  Silas follows.

12471247INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - BARRED ROOM - NIGHT

      Methos is standing in the room, a tray of food untouched in
      front of Cassandra.

                                      METHOS
                    It's not pleasant even for an Immortal
                    to starve to death.

      She throws him a look as Kronos storms in, followed by Silas. 
      Kronos grabs Cassandra by the arm, pulls her to her feet.

                                      KRONOS
                          (to Silas)
                    If MacLeod even gets close, kill
                    her.

      He shoves Cassandra at Silas.  She struggles, turns to face
      Kronos.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He's alive?

                                      KRONOS
                    Not for long.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (to Methos)
                    You failed.

      Kronos grabs Methos by the arm.

                                      KRONOS
                    Come, my clever friend, you and I
                    are going to poison a city.

12481248INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

      MacLeod is sitting at the great table, his sword in hand.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      Kronos and Methos enter, they get the BUZZ.  They turn to
      see --

                    The Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse
                    doesn't have quite the same ring,
                    does it, Kronos?  What are you going
                    to do now?

                                      KRONOS
                    You're not going to be around to
                    find out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We'll see about that.

      He takes his stance, ready for battle.

                                      KRONOS
                    Think of the witch, Highlander. 
                    Think of Cassandra.
                          (smiling)
                    Lay down your sword, and she'll keep
                    on living.  Fight, and win or lose,
                    she's dead.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Methos)
                    You set me up.

                                      KRONOS
                    He's the master.

                    What do you say, MacLeod?  Your life
                    for hers?  I promise I'll take good
                    care of her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think she'd rather be dead.

      Kronos grins.

                    Your call.

      As Kronos and MacLeod square off, Kronos commands Methos

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Go tell Silas to finish her.  And
                    let her know it was MacLeod's
                    decision.

      As Methos turns to go, MacLeod calls after him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Methos!  Don't do this!

      Methos stops, turns.  His expression is inscrutable.

                    Like you said, I go with the winner.

      Methos heads out.

                                      KRONOS
                    Methos understands what you don't. 
                    He knows what I am.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What you were, Kronos.  Your time is

                    You still don't understand, do you?
                    I am the end of time.

      With an almost unearthly speed, Kronos swings at MacLeod,
      nearly cutting him in half.

12491249INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      As Methos comes hurrying toward Cassandra's room, Silas pulls
      her into the hallway, his ax in his free hand.

                                      SILAS
                    MacLeod's here?

      Methos nods.  Silas turns, pushes Cassandra to her knees. 
      He raises the ax to behead her --

      METHOS' SWORD

      blocks his downswing.

      SILAS

      reacts in shock.

                          (disbelief)
                    For the girl's head?

      He looks into Methos' eyes, sees the challenge there -- no
      backing down.

                                      SILAS (CONT'D)
                    Take it.  She's yours, brother.

      He steps aside, gesturing to Methos to take her head.  Methos
      pivots as Silas steps aside, his eyes tracking Silas' ax.

      He brings his sword down toward Cassandra, slicing the ropes
      that bind her arms, then finishes the backswing to meet Silas'
      ax as it swings for him.

                                      SILAS
                    How can you do this?  How can you
                    betray who we are?

                                      METHOS
                    You have no idea who I am.

      Silas charges at Methos and Methos defends.

      MacLeod and Kronos are still at it, through the room with
      the monkeys chattering insanely.

                    Not bad.  But not enough.

                    There's more.

                    Maybe you'll be with her in the
                      afterlife.

      Kronos makes an angry attack.  MacLeod deflects the blow and
      manages to knock Kronos a little off balance.

12511251INT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Methos seems to be getting the upper hand.  Then both Methos
      and Silas react to an O.S. battle yell.

12521252EXT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - NIGHT

      MacLeod drives Kronos from the chateau.  Rage and frustration

      similar to Caspian's

      KRONOS

      raises his sword and charges MacLeod in a fury.

      Momentarily blinded by his rage, Kronos leaves

      MACLEOD

      an opening.  one is all it takes.  MacLeod takes Kronos'
      head and the Quickening begins.

12531253EXT.  KRONOS' CHATEAU - BALCONY - NIGHT

      Methos has been driven through a door, against a balcony
      railing.  He's struggling to keep Silas' ax away from his
      neck.  Then, the BOOM of the Quickening.

      Neither of them know whose head has fallen.  But Silas' split-
      second reaction to the nearby sound and fury gives Methos
      his chance.  He takes it, and takes Silas' head.

      The two simultaneous Quickenings light the exterior of the
      chateau, with two battered, kneeling figures at the center --
      Methos on the balcony and MacLeod on the ground.

      As the Quickening dies away

      CASSANDRA

      picks up Silas' ax and raises it over the exhausted Methos. 
      Methos looks up at Cassandra, physically and emotionally
      drained, his expression tired and sad.

                                      METHOS
                    I killed Silas.
                          (to himself)
                    I liked Silas.

      Cassandra reacts angrily, her words almost exploding under
      his.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    And now I'm supposed to forgive you?

      MACLEOD

      runs in and finds this tableau.  Methos on his knees by Silas'
      body, Cassandra standing with ax ready to strike, tears
      streaming down her face.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra...

      Cassandra looks at him.  Ax still raised, arms trembling
      with the effort of holding it.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (in anger and disbelief)
                    You want me to let him live?

      There's a long beat before --

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes.
                          (simply)
                    I want you to let him live.

      After a long moment, Cassandra drops the ax.  As she turns
      and walks away --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

12541254EXT.  BORDEAUX - A PICTURESQUE LOCATION - DAY

      MacLeod and Methos are in conversation.  There's no anger
      between them, but there is a distinct awkwardness -- their
      former easy camaraderie has been blasted away, and will take
      some time to heal.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You must have known Kronos would
                    escape that well one day.

                                      METHOS
                    I tried not to think about it.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    You had the chance, why didn't you
                    kill him?

                                      METHOS
                    I wanted to.
                          (a beat)
                    But I couldn't.  Not then, maybe not
                    ever.
                          (beat)
                    We were brothers.  In arms, in blood,
                    in everything but birth.
                          (beat)
                    If I judged him worthy to die, I
                    judged myself the same... and I wanted
                    to live.  I still do.

      MacLeod looks at him sharply.  Not liking what he's thinking.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Kronos was right, wasn't he?  You
                    set the whole thing up.

                                      METHOS
                    What do you mean?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You knew Kronos would take Cassandra. 
                    And you let him, because you knew
                    I'd come after her.
                          (beat)
                    You couldn't kill him, but you knew
                    I could.

                                      METHOS
                    Maybe I hoped you could.

      He turns to walk away.  MacLeod takes his arm, forces him to
      turn back.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What about Cassandra?

      Methos looks at him a long moment.

                                      METHOS
                          (quietly)
                    One of a thousand regrets, MacLeod. 
                    One of a thousand regrets.

      As he walks off into the fog, with MacLeod looking after him --

                                                                              FADE OUT.
