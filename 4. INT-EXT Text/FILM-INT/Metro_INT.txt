Roper's police radio SQUAWKS.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
One-one-four to Roper.
He picks up the radio.
ROPER
Dig in, Cozy Girl...
(into the radio)
Roper go.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
One-four, Roper. Code 2.C.P. 4th and
Grand.
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy
Girl and Backtrack...
ROPER
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
He tosses the radio down. Punches the accelerator.
ROPER
Stay up there, Girl...
TRACK ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now
a head...
Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is
setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff
are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper
saunters in.
ROPER
Hello, guys.
BAFFERT
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join
us.
Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing.
ROPER
Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?
Baffert hands him a folder. Roper opens it.
BAFFERT
This guy is no genius.
Roper scans the profile.
ROPER
They're not usually graduate students.
BAFFERT
SWAT wants to go in.
ROPER
What's the rush? They haven't killed
anybody yet this week?
Roper refers to the folder.
ROPER
We got a guy who's probably on drugs.
He's got a record of 459's and he
was busted on possession. But he's
never been busted on a major felony.
What's his demeanor?
KIMURA
Well he's a little fucking agitated --
he ripped the phone out.
ROPER
I have to go face to face.
BAFFERT
No -- you can't do that.
ROPER
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of
them's wounded -- We don't know how
bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone
out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to
the head of a female hostage. If
SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna
lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go
in. Maybe I can see what's going on
in there.
BAFFERT
I don't know.
ROPER
He's never offed anybody. His rap
doesn't show any violence.
BAFFERT
Not that we know of.
ROPER
We don't know how much time we have.
If I can get in to talk to him --
maybe we won't lose anyone.
BAFFERT
Maybe we can get a throw phone in
there.
KIMURA
SWAT says it's broken -- The perp in
the last situation rendered it
inoperable.
BAFFERT
What do you mean?
KIMURA
He urinated on it and shorted out
the circuits.
ROPER
We gonna stand here and talk about
it or let the guy in there bleed to
death.
(beat... beat)
Give me a dozen donuts.
Roper pulls out his gun and places it on the counter.
A tense situation. A wild-eyed, white punk, fuck-up of a
BANK ROBBER, EARL, is holding a pretty, young TELLER around
the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple.
The other bank employees are cowering on the floor. A few
are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-conscious
and oozing blood from his side.
Roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward
Earl, very sociable.
ROPER
Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna
donut? I ate the glazed but there's
a bunch of chocolate and a --
Earl swipes the donuts out of Roper's hand and starts frisking
Roper for weapons with his free hand. The other hand still
has the gun poised at the young teller's head.
ROPER
I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry
a weapon.
Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. It seems to
help. Earl finishes patting Roper down, straightens back up
and puts his hand around the teller's neck.
EARL
Where's the car?
ROPER
I need to get something straight
first.
Roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the
floor.
ROPER
Who's the manager?
A balding, middle-aged MAN sheepishly raises his hand.
MANAGER
I am.
Roper takes a step toward him.
ROPER
When did you start keeping longer
hours?
MANAGER
Last spring.
ROPER
Really! Because I've been thinking
of moving to this branch. It would
be really convenient for me --
EARL
HEY, SHUT UP!
Earl wags his gun against the Teller's ear.
EARL
Do you want me to start killing
people?!
Roper holds his hand up defensively.
ROPER
It's my job to see that no one gets
killed, Earl... Including you.
EARL
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Earl is pouring sweat. His gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.
ROPER
I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to
do this the right way.
Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl. His voice is calm.
ROPER
First I need you to point that gun
away from --
(to the teller)
What's your name?
TELLER
(voice trembling)
Debbie...
ROPER
Point the gun away from Debbie.
EARL
Debbie's brains are going to be
splattered all over the floor if I
don't see a car in five minutes!
Roper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger.
ROPER
Alright! But let's be clear about
one thing. If you kill someone, I
can't help you. The SWAT guys will
take you out.
Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects
for a moment on the reality of the situation.
EARL
What are my chances of getting out
of here?
Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.
ROPER
Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a
bank in Daly City...
Roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard.
ROPER
How ya doin'?
The guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back
the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces.
ROPER
(to Earl)
...Cops gave him a car, and he lost
them on the freeway.
Earl is encouraged by that.
EARL
Really?
ROPER
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally
your smartest criminals.
Roper looks directly into Earl's eyes.
ROPER
He didn't kill anybody, though.
Roper bends over the guard.
ROPER
This is gonna hurt.
He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him
across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously.
EARL
Hey, leave him alone. What are you
doing?
Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.
ROPER
It's part of my negotiator's oath.
If there's an injured party and I
can help them, I'm duty bound by my
oath to do that. You can shoot me if
you want, but the next negotiator in
here is going to tell you the same
thing.
Earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath.
He lets Roper drag the guard to the door.
ROPER
I'll be right back, Earl. Point that
gun away from Debbie.
Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head,
then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple.
Earl watches Roper through the window. He can only see Roper's
back. He's getting very agitated.
EARL
(yelling)
HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT
THERE!
The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper
calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from
Earl.
ROPER
As a rule, I need one hostage released
as show of good faith.
Roper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears
start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave.
ROPER
Give me Debbie.
Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her
head.
EARL
Take the old guy.
The other hostages watch this exchange tensely.
ROPER
The Old Guy? What kind of show of
faith is that? I want Debbie.
EARL
Am I gettin' the car?
ROPER
You're gettin' the car.
Earl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. He points at
two of the female employees cowering against the counter.
EARL
Take them.
Roper decides that this is the best he's going to get.
ROPER
You two, leave.
The two women don't need any extra encouragement. They jump
up and rush out the front door.
ROPER
That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going
to get your car.
Roper turns around and walks toward the front door. He stops
and looks over his shoulder.
ROPER
Oh, there's one last thing.
Earl looks like he's right on the edge.
EARL
What?!
ROPER
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Earl thinks about that for a beat...
ROPER
Hardtop.
Roper turns around, starts walking again. He keeps his eyes
focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the
bank.
ROPER
(without turning around)
Manual or automatic?
EARL
Automatic.
ROPER
You got it.
In one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and FIRES!...
One SHOT. It tears into Earl's shoulder. One inch from
Debbie's neck. Earl is blown back against the counter. Debbie
shrieks at the top of her lungs.
SWAT guys pour in from every entrance. YELLING for everybody
to "GET DOWN"! Pointing guns. They pounce on Earl.
EARL
I give up! I give up!
Roper goes to Debbie, puts his arm around her and gently
leads her out of the bank.
Lots of activity. Officers in cubicles; talking on phones;
typing reports on computers. Most are plain-clothed. Roper
weaves through the room. Passes by Baffert's desk.
ROPER
Hey, Baffert, what's the story for
tonight?
Baffert pulls two tickets for the Warriors' game out of his
pocket.
BAFFERT
Floor seats.
ROPER
You're my hero.
BAFFERT
Dinner's on you.
ROPER
Deal.
A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive
branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper
walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall
quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and
McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it.
He goes into the Captain's office.
CAPTAIN FRANK SOLIS is on the phone. There's a file on the
desk in front of him. He motions Roper to sit down.
SOLIS
He just walked into my office.
(looks over at Roper)
The Chief says, "Good work this
morning. Congratulations."
Roper smiles as he sits down.
ROPER
Tell him to give me a raise.
SOLIS
(into the phone)
He says, "Thank you very much."
(a beat)
I'll discuss it with him right now...
Good-bye, Chief.
Solis hangs up. Looks across the desk at Roper. A long pause.
He knows he's got leverage.
SOLIS
Roper.
ROPER
What?
SOLIS
Are you going to make this hard for
me?
ROPER
Depends. What's up?
SOLIS
There's been some concern about you
continuing to work without back-up.
ROPER
Define concern.
Solis dumps his cards on the table.
SOLIS
What if you die and no one can do
what you do as well as you do it?
ROPER
Your concern is heartwarming.
SOLIS
It's been decided that you take on
another partner and train him to be
able to take over for you.
ROPER
Is that what the guy in the Sunday
School suit is doing outside?
SOLIS
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro
Captain agrees that he's their top
sharp-shooter and most likely to
succeed.
Roper grabs McCall's folder off the desk.
ROPER
Let me see that.
Roper scans it.
ROPER
Tested high on his intellectual
aptitude... Not as high as me but...
National marksman finalist... Attended
N. Y. C... Went to college. Very
impressive. F.B.I. sniper school...
Mayorial commendation.
McCall turns around in his chair. He can see Roper and Solis
through the glass walls of the office, but he can't hear
their voices.
ROPER
"Additional Skills": Biathelete,
marathoner, lip-reading, speaks
Spanish...
Roper throws the folder back on the desk.
ROPER
Great, send him to the Marines. This
guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit
in two weeks.
SOLIS
You let us worry about that.
ROPER
Is there going to be an expression
of your appreciation?
SOLIS
(gloomily)
What kind of appreciation are we
talking about?
ROPER
The financial kind. I figure I'm
going to be working extra hours. All
sorts of overtime... training
sessions... Not to mention the extra
stress...
SOLIS
What do you think would be in order?
ROPER
Like ahh... I don't know...
(boldly)
Five thousand dollars.
SOLIS
(calmly)
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Uh-oh, Roper thinks maybe he sold short.
ROPER
(quickly)
And a car.
SOLIS
Hey, you just got a five thousand
dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
ROPER
You know you've got nothing but cars
down there in impound.
SOLIS
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
ROPER
(firmly)
The car is part of the deal.
SOLIS
What happened to your Trans Am?
Solis gets up and taps the glass, motions for McCall to come
in.
ROPER
Repoed this morning.
SOLIS
(relenting)
I'll provide you with transportation.
ROPER
And even if this doesn't work, I
want all the money. These SWAT guys
don't have the temperament. They
don't have the background...
McCall enters the office.
ROPER
(instant character
change)
Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard
nothing but good things about you...
Roper reaches out. They shake hands.
MCCALL
Same here. I've watched you in action.
Very impressive.
ROPER
You've got a lot of hard work ahead
of you if you want to be a negotiator.
MCCALL
I'm ready to do it.
(a beat)
And I'm going to be here more than
two weeks.
Roper's face darkens.
ROPER
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's
an intrusion. Save that shit for the
sniper school. Comprende?
MCCALL
Sorry... Habit.
SOLIS
(intervening)
Let's move past this, gentlemen.
Roper smiles.
ROPER
We're already past it, aren't we,
Kevin?
MCCALL
If you say so.
SOLIS
Then you'll have to excuse me. I
have other work to do.
Roper and McCall head out the door.
SOLIS
Roper...
Roper turns back around.
SOLIS
About the transportation issue...
You check with the impound sergeant.
Roper smiles. Total victory.
MOVING with Roper and McCall.
ROPER
You ever been in a hostage situation?
MCCALL
Only at the very end.
ROPER
How do you feel after a shooting.
MCCALL
(self-assured)
Like it had to be done.
They enter the squadroom, wind through the cubicles.
ROPER
It rarely has to be done.
MCCALL
I've rarely shot anyone.
ROPER
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
MCCALL
(flatly)
I know.
ROPER
Try to remember that.
They arrive at Roper's desk.
ROPER
Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one...
Roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk. He
takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the
empty bottle. He places the bottle on his desk.
ROPER
Extract that pen cap without touching
or moving the bottle.
McCall looks at the bottle quizzically.
MCCALL
What's the point of this?
ROPER
A little exercise in lateral thinking.
The obvious solution isn't always
the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Roper grabs his jacket and walks off, leaving McCall to ponder
the problem. McCall looks over at another cop who has been
observing. The cop shrugs his shoulders. He hasn't got a
clue. McCall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Roper and Baffert walking past the row of cars, including
Solis' cadillac, searching for Roper's "new" transportation...
Roper is holding the keys in his hand.
BAFFERT
Mind if we make a stop on the way?
We busted Frank Antonucci on
possession. He gave us a lead on
that Polk Street jewelry heist.
ROPER
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your
time. He'd tell you his granny was
in on the Kennedy assassination if
he could dodge a collar.
BAFFERT
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is
half my job.
ROPER
Yeah, okay.
Roper is looking at the numbered parking spaces.
BAFFERT
This SWAT guy might be a good idea.
He may be able to take a little
pressure off you. I worry about you.
ROPER
You worried about me, too? The chief's
worried about me. Solis is worried
about me. Maybe you guys should start
some kind of organization.
BAFFERT
Speaking of which. I saw you talking
to Ronnie this morning. Why can't
you get it back together with her.
You've gotta be out of your mind not
to get with that one.
ROPER
It's not me. It's her. She's going
out with this baseball player --
Greg Barnett.
BAFFERT
(impressed)
No shit! He's good!
ROPER
Fuck him. He swings at anything in
the dirt. I could strike him out.
BAFFERT
Don't give up on her. You're getting
to the age when you ought to be
thinking about these things.
Roper bends over like an old man.
ROPER
Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up.
They arrive at their destination. A parking space with a
1957 DODGE PICKUP.
BAFFERT
This is it. Space 742.
Roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief.
ROPER
Then he didn't say 742. He must have
said 724 or something, because this
can't be right.
Baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to Roper who
is crossing to the truck.
ROPER
Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not
riding in this shit. I can't roll in
no shit like this.
He takes the keys from Baffert who moves around to the
passengers side. He opens the door.
BAFFERT
Where's the stereo?
ROPER
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
BAFFERT
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
Baffert pulls out a slip of paper.
BAFFERT
Apartment 306.
ROPER
You want me to go up with you?
BAFFERT
Nah, It probably won't turn up
anything. I'm just gonna talk to
him.
ROPER
Good. I don't want to be late.
Baffert gets out. Roper grabs his cell phone.
ROPER
You want anything on the game?
Baffert turns back around.
BAFFERT
What's the line?
ROPER
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
BAFFERT
I'll take half of your action.
Baffert goes into the building. Roper dials his cellular
phone. Beep! Beep!
DETAIL SHOT
A message on the display reads: RECHARGE BATTERY.
Roper looks around. There's a payphone across the street. He
gets out of the truck and crosses to it.
Third floor hallway. Nice, middle class place. Well kept up.
Baffert walks over to room 306. Knocks.
Jazz is playing. MICHAEL KORDA sits motionless in a chair
listening to the music. There's a KNOCK. Korda responds as
if pulled from a trance. He rises and moves to the door.
KORDA
Who is it?
BAFFERT (V.O.)
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the
San Francisco Police Department.
A slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the
apartment. For what reason, we don't know. Maybe to make
sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door.
KORDA
What happened? Is there a problem?
BAFFERT
May I come in? I would just like to
ask you a couple of questions.
Korda steps aside and lets Baffert enter. Korda closes the
door. Baffert scans the place. Not bad. He listens to the
music. A smile grows on his face.
BAFFERT
Count Basie?
Korda smiles back. Another jazz aficionada.
KORDA
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What
They Used To Be", recorded July 30,
1945.
BAFFERT
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Korda goes to the stereo, turns it down. Duke Ellington plays
low.
BAFFERT
Where did you find an old recording
like that?
KORDA
Used record shop down on Turk Street.
I was in there looking for some Robert
Johnson.
(searching for the
name)
Memories... Memory Lane or
something...
BAFFERT
I've got to stop in there... Mr.
Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
KORDA
You mean Frank who owns the bakery
down the street?
Baffert smiles.
BAFFERT
No, this is a different Frank. This
is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen
jewelry usually. You wouldn't know
anybody like that?
Korda drifts to the other side of the room. Takes a look out
his front window...
HIS POV
Nobody there. Just the truck.
KORDA
I certainly wouldn't.
He says it as if the very idea disturbs him. He turns away
from the window. Baffert feigns a coughing spell.
BAFFERT
Could I please have a little water?
KORDA
(the perfect host)
Of course.
Korda heads toward the kitchen area. Baffert uses this as an
opportunity to drift around the room. Do a little snooping.
BAFFERT
The reason I'm asking you is because
we arrested him with some stolen
jewelry. It was traced to the robbery
of a store down on Polk Street. He
said he was fencing it for you.
Baffert notices something in the trash can.
HIS POV
Several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels. They have
jeweler's markings on them indicating gem weight and grade.
Korda, pouring the water, notices Baffert's discovery, but
his face betrays nothing.
KORDA
(calmly)
There's obviously some mistake. I
have a cousin who has had run-ins
with the law.
Korda re-enters the room with the glass of water.
KORDA
Perhaps for his own reasons he
entangled me in this... situation.
BAFFERT
This cousin of yours... What's his
name?
KORDA
(forthrightly)
Clarence Teal.
They look at each other a beat. Korda is still holding the
water.
KORDA
Your cough seems to be better.
A real repressed tension here. Someone's about to get hurt.
Baffert takes the glass of water.
BAFFERT
Thank you.
He takes a sip. Korda watches him like a cobra. Baffert puts
the glass down on the table.
BAFFERT
Well, I'm on my way to the game. I
appreciate your cooperation, Mr.
Korda.
Korda smiles. Baffert walks to the door. Opens it to leave...
KORDA
Lieutenant...
Baffert turns back around.
KORDA
Do you believe that story about Robert
Johnson...? That he made a deal with
the devil at the crossroads?
Baffert muses along with Korda.
BAFFERT
Could be.
Baffert moves off down the hall and Korda closes his door.
Baffert gets into the elevator.
Baffert takes out his cell phone. Dials.
BAFFERT
(as the elevator
descends)
Hello, Judge Stone... This is
Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a
suspect's residence. I'm requesting
a telephonic search warrant in
connection with an armed robbery at
a jewelry store. There's visible
evidence on the premises. Glassine
envelopes with jeweler's markings
were seen in the trash can...
The elevator hits the first floor.
BAFFERT
...I believe a full search of the
premises will turn up some stolen
property...
The elevator opens.
Korda is standing there with a knife.
Baffert has no time to react...
The knife hand slashes forward... Stabbing the chest and
slashing across the throat.
Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his
neck and chest. Roper rushes over to him. It doesn't look
good.
The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first
flight of stairs. Frozen. Roper pulls out his gun and rushes
by her up the stairs.
ROPER
(to the woman)
Get an ambulance!
Roper arrives at the top of the stairs. Korda's door is ajar.
Duke Ellington can be heard faintly.
Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready...
No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a
door. Roper races out.
Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it
open. Gun aimed.
A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds
up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he
leaves.
Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window
looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone.
SOLIS
(on the phone)
Yes sir. Every resource will be
brought to bear. We will find this
guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll
tell him.
Solis hangs up the phone.
SOLIS
The chief says to tell you how sorry
he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a
good man.
ROPER
(still looking out
window)
He said he was just going up to talk
to him. He said...
(beat; turning to
Solis)
I want to be put on this case.
SOLIS
I can't do that.
ROPER
(emphatic)
I want to be put on this case.
SOLIS
You know I can't assign you to this.
You're much too close to it. You
were much too close to Sam. The
department will take care of it.
ROPER
Who's running it?
SOLIS
Roper...
ROPER
Who's running it!
SOLIS
Kimura and Glass will head the
investigation.
Roper turns to leave.
SOLIS
Scott. Go home. Get some sleep.
Roper pauses at the door. Then pulls out two basketball
tickets and lays them on the table in Solis' office. He exits.
CUT TO:
Two detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named
GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming.
ROPER
Hey, hey, hey...
Roper intercepts them.
ROPER
Anything on Korda so far?
KIMURA
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Roper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward
Solis' hallway.
ROPER
I don't give a damn what Solis said.
(to the detectives)
If you get a lead, I want to know.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Thru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers
flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost.
Roper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard.
RONNIE (O.S.)
Just a minute.
Roper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door
opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed
casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and
earrings.
RONNIE
Hey.
ROPER
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
RONNIE
(like hell)
A little late for that, Scottie.
He's asleep.
(smells his breath)
Jack Daniels?
ROPER
I'm not drunk. Yet.
RONNIE
Maybe you should be.
ROPER
You heard.
She nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway.
RONNIE
Yeah. I'm sorry.
ROPER
Can I come in?
Ronnie opens the door reluctantly.
Roper enters. Instantly we see he's at home here. He hangs
his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices
a photograph on the wall. Quite imposing. Very unique style.
ROPER
That a new picture?
RONNIE
About 4 months old. I'm working in a
new style.
Roper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts
turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's
ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch
and his head in Roper's lap.
ROPER
Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy?
(to Ronnie)
He heard my voice.
Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his
presence. His words are light. His tone isn't.
ROPER
How's the good dog. I miss you buddy.
You miss me?
Ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's
carefully buried.
ROPER
He misses me.
She nods. A moment's silence.
ROPER
I won't stay long. I had to talk to
someone.
RONNIE
(a bit surprised at
his openness)
You don't usually talk to anyone
when you're hurting.
ROPER
It was my fault. I was right
downstairs. I should have gone up
with him.
RONNIE
Scott, You can't save everyone.
ROPER
I've proved that, didn't I?
She's not coming closer. She wants to, but she won't do it.
She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises.
ROPER
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
RONNIE
(gentle)
What do you want from me?
ROPER
Something I guess I can't have
anymore.
RONNIE
Don't try to make me feel guilty.
The whole time we were together, you
went out of your way to prove you
didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for
one night, you need me again. I can't
do it. I can't be more than your
friend. Because I know what will
happen. In a few weeks you'll be
back on top, and you'll shut me out
just as soon as you don't need me
again.
ROPER
(surprised, hurt)
You think I didn't need you?
RONNIE
If you did, you never showed it.
ROPER
Ronnie...
He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to
him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie
pulls back, confused and guilty.
ROPER
You expecting someone?
Her silence is the answer... A flash of pain from Roper.
ROPER
This day just keeps getting better.
Ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets.
RONNIE
(soft)
They're on the table where you always
leave them.
He grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside
waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his
face.
GREG
Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were...
Greg's smile fades as he sees Roper.
ROPER
I was just leaving.
Roper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway. Ronnie
makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him
to follow Roper. She calls after him.
RONNIE
Scottie... take care of yourself.
Roper doesn't look back. He just goes.
Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence
shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are
connected to the end of the warehouse.
Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is
waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence
from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him
around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt.
KORDA
If you weren't family I'd kill you.
Clarence is scared. He offers no defense.
KORDA
You told Antonucci that shit came
from me.
CLARENCE
So that we could get the best price.
He's got respect for you. He's gonna
try to lowball me, Mike.
Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot.
KORDA
You fucking idiot! Why do you think
I use you?... To be a walking
advertisement.
CLARENCE
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of
LaMarra flipping on anyone before.
He said he had the cops paid off.
Antonucci never flipped on anyone
before. He had the cops paid off.
KORDA
Not the fucking cop that showed up
at my door!
CLARENCE
What happened, Mike.
KORDA
You don't want to know.
Tears start to come to Clarence's eyes.
CLARENCE
I'm sorry, Mike.
Clarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a
twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from
striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay.
KORDA
God damn it! I still needed to case
that fucking store. It's too risky
to show my face now.
CLARENCE
I got a couple thousand bucks. You
could leave town.
KORDA
Leave town? They're going to know me
in fucking Des Moines now!...
(a beat)
They got over ten million in jewels
in that place. That's freedom, man.
I could go anywhere I want.
Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add
up in his head.
CLARENCE
Did you kill him, Mike?
Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers
the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper
again.
CLARENCE
I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...
We're talking major fear here...
Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around
again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against
his chest.
KORDA
It's not your fault you're stupid.
Tears of relief from Clarence.
Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks
to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling.
A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair,
reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in
Hostage Situations". On the desk in front of him is the bottle
with the pen cap still in it.
ROPER
(to Kimura and Glass)
What do you got on Korda?
KIMURA
We ran a search on relatives. He has
a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal.
Smalltime thief. Last known address
was on Pine Street. He moved out a
month ago. We've got a couple leads
on him to check out.
ROPER
(rapid fire)
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles
registration?
KIMURA
Being faxed over now.
ROPER
How about the record room for any
incident reports? He might be a
victim. We can get medical records.
Check with burglary detail and see
if anyone else knows him, knows his
habits.
KIMURA
Roper...
ROPER
And what about bars? We can talk to
neighbors to see what bars he
frequents.
KIMURA
Roper, we're into it...
Suddenly Solis appears at their side.
SOLIS
We've had this conversation once,
Roper. You're not active on this
case.
Roper looks at him icily.
SOLIS
It's in everyone's best interest.
McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely.
After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis
heads back to this office.
ROPER
(softened)
You guys are doing good work.
He moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him
coming.
MCCALL
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a
friend in SWAT killed. I know how it
can be.
ROPER
I appreciate your concern. Let's
leave it at that.
McCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda
bottle.
ROPER
I don't see much progress here.
McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot
from a nearby "Mr. Coffee" machine. It's filled with water.
He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle.
CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE
The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without
touching or moving the bottle.
ROPER
Very nice... You get an "A". Notice...
No force required. No damage.
Just then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom.
SERGEANT
Roper, domestic disturbance at 472
6th Street. Possible hostage
situation.
McCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk,
then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies". He looks at
the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the
trash can. He and McCall head out.
Start on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging
from the rear view mirror. PULL BACK to show a police bubble
flashing on the dashboard.
Roper weaving through traffic. McCall is sitting calmly as
ever.
ROPER
So, McCall, how come you ended up in
San Francisco?
MCCALL
They recruited me. Promised me fast
advancement.
ROPER
Recruited you from where?
MCCALL
National Marksman Competition.
ROPER
With your qualifications you must
have had a lot of offers. Why here?
MCCALL
Furthest point I could find from New
York.
ROPER
You don't like New York?
MCCALL
Spent my whole life there. I just
wanted to get out for a while.
ROPER
You'd never been out of New York?
MCCALL
Been to Toronto. My mother was born
there.
ROPER
How did you like Toronto?
MCCALL
It was okay.
ROPER
You're a real excitable sort, aren't
you?
MCCALL
You caught me on an "up" day.
(a beat)
How about you? How did you end up in
San Francisco?
ROPER
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the
Bay Bridge and here I was.
(a beat)
So you're looking for "fast
advancement".
MCCALL
Is there something wrong with that?
ROPER
I'm not sure.
McCall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop.
The screams are getting more panicky. Roper comes down the
hall quickly. The door to the apartment is open. It's been
that way since the guy in the green slacks fled. Roper hurries
toward the door.
The WIFE is in bra and panties and the HUSBAND is 6'4". He's
giving her a good beating. It's a studio apartment. Unmade
bed. Belongings strewn all over. Window open with sun
streaming in, and a good view of the building across the
street. We hear ROPER'S VOICE from out in the hall.
ROPER (V.O.)
I'm coming in. I'm not armed.
The husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife
to her throat.
WIFE
(shrieking)
No, Raymond!
RAYMOND
(to Roper)
Stay the fuck out of here!
But Roper steps into the apartment. Sees the wife. Face
swollen. Knife to her neck. The enraged husband, contemplating
murder. One inch from committing the act. Roper doesn't bat
an eye.
ROPER
I know how you feel, Ray.
RAYMOND
You don't know shit, and I suggest
you leave.
He presses the knife against the wife's throat. She winces.
Her chest heaves.
ROPER
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my
negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the
room with the hostage, I have to
stay.
RAYMOND
You don't want to see what I'm going
to do to her.
ROPER
Let me show you something, Ray.
Roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet. He
extracts a photo.
CLOSEUP PHOTO
Wife. Two kids. A little dog-eared. Nice touch.
ROPER
holds it up so Raymond can see it.
ROPER
Same thing happened to me, man. She
cheated on me, but I forgave her.
You know why?
RAYMOND
I ain't interested in your life story.
ROPER
Because I was partially to blame. I
wasn't around as much as I should
have been. I forgot how to love her.
RAYMOND
She's the one to blame. Not me.
Everyone where we left them. Roper looks at Ray with utter
sincerity.
ROPER
Ray, think about how she looked when
you married her. Think about how
happy you were. Don't lose that,
man. Don't give up everything.
RAYMOND
What am I giving up? I'm laid off
last year. I'm down to my last
unemployment check. I'm out on the
streets looking for work and this
bitch is banging some asshole in my
bed.
And now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not
that coherent.
RAYMOND
I'm down at Consolidated and I'm
begging. I'm saying I'll take half
my pay. Eight years, man. I don't
even have to work the loading docks
anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're
cutting back. We're streamlining,
Ray. West Central's running things
now. It's out of our hands" Fuck
them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM!
(deep sigh)
I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna
kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna
live anymore.
Roper reaches out to him.
ROPER
Ray, if you walk out of here with
me, I'll get you a job.
RAYMOND
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
ROPER
I can't guarantee you what it will
be. But I swear on my life, I'll
find you work.
RAYMOND
And why the fuck would you do that
for me?
ROPER
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close
friend of mine was killed this week.
The way I figure it, I stop you from
doin' what you said, I'm one up on
body count.
RAYMOND
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
ROPER
My name's Scott Roper.
Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife
clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes
closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat...
Then...
RAYMOND
I need my coat.
It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has
to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns
and goes to get his coat.
He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat.
POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor.
The wife runs out of the room, screaming!
ROPER
NOOOO!!
He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the
carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat.
He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A
couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper
bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds
down the stairs... down another flight...
Roper follows, screaming his head off.
ROPER
Do you think because the police
department issued you a sniper rifle,
it makes you God! What the fuck goes
on in your head?
McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow
"crime scene" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops
are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under
the tape. Roper follows.
McCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes
up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms.
Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun "Saturday night special"
variety. McCall looks up at Roper.
MCCALL
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember?
I just saved a life. Yours.
Roper doesn't miss a beat.
ROPER
(still angry)
You think I've never had a gun pulled
on me?! You think every fucking time
someone pulls a gun they use it?!
McCall gets to his feet.
MCCALL
Eighty-five percent of domestic
disturbances of this nature end in
murder/suicide.
ROPER
(fiercely)
Not the ones I'm at.
McCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat.
McCall's face softens just perceptibly.
MCCALL
Sorry. My mistake.
He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed,
contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses
the sheet over Ray's dead body.
Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked
"Internal Affairs". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the
floor. Waiting.
The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal
affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on
the back.
INVESTIGATOR
Looks like a clean shoot. Go home
and get some rest.
McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear
back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled
off considerably. Even a tad friendly.
ROPER
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
MCCALL
I don't really like to drink.
ROPER
You have to. It's a tradition.
MCCALL
Well, if I have to, I have to.
A neighborhood bar. Roper and McCall are playing pool. Half-
finished beers are on a nearby table. McCall is bent over
the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. Roper
studies him.
ROPER
You got a girlfriend?
MCCALL
Why? You like my ass?
McCall misses the shot.
ROPER
Better than your pool game.
Roper lines up his shot.
ROPER
You wouldn't want to put a small
wager on this, would you?
MCCALL
I don't gamble.
Roper smiles. Sinks his shot. Moves around the table.
MCCALL
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
ROPER
You living together?
MCCALL
She's back in Jersey... going to
graduate school.
ROPER
Explain how that works.
MCCALL
She's going to come here when she
graduates and then we're gonna get
married.
ROPER
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
MCCALL
(as if that were
unthinkable)
No, no, no...
(a beat)
She's from Hoboken.
ROPER
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long
for companionship with her such a
long way away in New Jersey?
MCCALL
We see each other every couple of
months.
ROPER
Every couple of months, huh?
A couple of months sounds like an awful long time to Roper.
ROPER
That's a lot of commitment. I admire
that.
MCCALL
Do you really?
ROPER
No. Actually I think it's fucking
crazy, I don't know if I could do
it.
MCCALL
Thanks for clearing that up.
(a beat)
I hear your former girlfriend is
going out with Greg Barnett.
ROPER
Where did you hear that?
MCCALL
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
ROPER
Yeah, well that's a sore subject,
and therefore out of bounds to a
young sprout of a hostage negotiator
under my tutelage.
A beat and then McCall realizes that this comment is a major
acknowledgement of acceptance from Roper. Roper misses his
shot. Picks up his beer glass.
ROPER
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should
have been lesson one. Never exchange
yourself for a hostage.
MCCALL
I think I can handle that one.
ROPER
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
Roper takes a drink of beer. Nears the bottom of his glass.
Calls to the BARTENDER.
ROPER
Zack, another round.
Roper turns back to McCall.
ROPER
My partner gave himself in exchange
for a ten year old girl. He got caught
in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner
and the bad guy...
(takes the last sip)
Weird thing is, if he was alive,
he'd probably do it again.
(a beat)
Some people never learn.
Roper puts down his glass.
ROPER
You think you can learn, McCall?
MCCALL
I think so.
Roper nods. Maybe he can.
We're looking at a door. It's not clear where we are. McCall
enters. We only see his face. Determined.
MCCALL
I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?
REVERSE ANGLE
It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience
store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to
represent a hostage situation. The "BAD GUY" has a walkie-
talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out
of it.
BAD GUY
What the fuck do you think is going
on, turdhead? I'm about to waste
everyone in this place.
McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response. He seems
stiff and awkward.
MCCALL
H... how can I help you? Tell me
what...
(looks off to his
right)
I feel stupid talking to a dummy.
Roper enters the training room from a side door. He's holding
the other walkie-talkie.
ROPER
What did you think? I'm going to let
you practice on real people?
Roper comes up beside him.
ROPER
First things is, don't say, "What's
going on?" Everybody knows what's
going on. I come into this situation,
I say,
(addressing the
mannequin)
"I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's
good. I'm here to help you."
(turns back to McCall)
Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate.
If you're thinking, talk while you're
thinking, or else he's going to think
you're plotting. Which you are. If
he thinks you're plotting, you're
going to make him nervous. You don't
want him nervous. Got that?
MCCALL
No.
ROPER
It'll come. Try again.
ANGLE ON THE DOOR. McCall comes in. The room has the same
set-up. McCall takes a look around. Launches immediately
into...
MCCALL
My name's McCall. I'm a hostage
negotiator. I'm here to help you.
Roper's voice crackles back at him hostilely.
ROPER (V.O.)
How are you going to help me?
McCall's confidence is growing.
MCCALL
Tell me what you need.
ROPER (V.O.)
I need you to bring me the scumbag
who ran off with my wife so I can
cut off his nuts.
Now he's stumped.
MCCALL
(hesitantly)
I can't do that.
ROPER (V.O.)
Then get out of my face you worthless
piece of frogshit.
McCall looks up to his right.
MCCALL
Is all the name calling necessary.
Roper re-enters the training area.
ROPER
Nah, I just throw that in because I
enjoy it.
MCCALL
(exasperated)
So what do I say to this guy?
ROPER
You could say something like,
(addressing the dummy)
"Tell me what the scumbag's name is.
Maybe we can work something out."
MCCALL
What? Bring somebody in so he can
cut his nuts off?
Roper turns to McCall.
ROPER
If you want to be a successful
negotiator, you've got to learn to
lie.
MCCALL
I'm not good at lying.
ROPER
Get good at it.
MCCALL
It's against my nature.
Roper gives him an amused smile.
ROPER
You know the ten commandments?
MCCALL
Yes.
ROPER
What's the first commandment?
MCCALL
Thou shall have no other God before
me.
That's not the answer Roper wanted.
ROPER
Okay, forget that. What's the main
one.
McCall is tired of guessing.
MCCALL
You tell me.
ROPER
Thou shall not kill... You've killed,
right?
MCCALL
Yes.
ROPER
Why?
MCCALL
To save lives.
ROPER
So why would you hesitate to lie to
save lives?
McCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back
to the side door.
ROPER
Let's try it again.
McCall comes through the door. Hands in the air. The setup
in the room has been changed a bit. The bad guy is behind
the counter. Several hostages in various positions on the
floor.
MCCALL
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
ROPER (V.O.)
Okay, stop.
Roper comes through the side door.
ROPER
Close your eyes.
McCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper
turns him away from the hostage scene.
ROPER
What did you see?
MCCALL
(rapid-fire)
A dirtbag behind the counter holding
a sawed-off. A Berretta nine
millimeter in his belt. A female
hostage, red dress, on the floor in
front of the cereal display. Male
hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt,
three feet to her right. Another
male hostage, white pants, green
shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the
magazine rack. A female dirtbag with
a gun under her shirt, sitting against
the beer cooler, trying to pass
herself off as a hostage, and there's
a special on toilet-paper, four for
a buck twenty-nine.
McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed.
ROPER
Very good. You've got good eyes.
That's important.
Roper and McCall are sitting in the dark watching a video
tape. It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting
goods store. A negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a
ten year old girl hostage. The negotiator holds his hands
out imploringly... Carefully moves toward the gunman. The
negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. The gunman
grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his
head. The little girl runs out of the picture to safety.
Roper remains dead silent during all this. McCall looks over
at him. The blue light flickers over Roper's motionless face.
MCCALL
Was that your partner?
Roper nods.
MCCALL
Why did he do it?
ROPER
(quietly)
Because he knew the little girl had
zero chance of survival and his
chances would be a little better...
We had a plan, but SWAT opened up
too early. He got caught in the
crossfire.
(a sad beat)
Let's move on... Notice this. Always
use the eyes to keep the connection.
It almost like hypnosis. That's the
most important thing. Create a
connection. You're always on their
side...
McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back
on the screen.
Roper is buying tickets. McCall is with him, watching the
other bettors, the odds board, all the monitors... Strange
place. Roper finishes and turns away from the window. Hands
McCall a ticket.
ROPER
I bought you a four-six exacta box.
You owe me twenty bucks.
MCCALL
(puzzled)
I do.
Roper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece,
not bad. McCall pockets his money.
MCCALL
How long you been coming here?
ROPER
About six years. My partner took me.
MCCALL
Is it always like this?
ROPER
Occasionally you lose.
Suddenly Roper's BEEPER goes off. He checks it, takes out a
cellular phone and dials.
ROPER
(into the phone)
Roper here.
(he listens)
I'm on my way.
He hangs up and turns to McCall.
ROPER
We gotta go.
It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story.
The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of
Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are
standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on
a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of
the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's
talking to the suspect.
SOLIS
We're working on that, Joe. These
things aren't quite that simple.
Roper and McCall enter. McCall joins the men who are studying
the blueprint. Roper stands by Solis and listens, takes note
of the poster of Tahiti. Looks inviting.
SOLIS
This will take time to setup. I'll
have to get authorizations.
(he listens)
Okay, you relax, and I'll --
Solis pulls the phone away from his ear. Joe has obviously
hung up.
ROPER
What do we got?
SOLIS
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went
off, then the fire alarm. A unit was
a block away, and the suspect got
trapped inside.
ROPER
Any verification on numbers.
SOLIS
We've only seen and talked to one
suspect. He calls himself "Joe".
There's two jewelers, two salespeople,
the manager, a security guard, and
an elderly woman. This particular
store is where they do a lot of
jewelry making and repair. They have
anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw
stones on any given day, so they
sure as shit didn't just wander in.
They knew what they were coming for.
ROPER
What have you promised them?
SOLIS
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
McCall returns from checking out the blueprints.
ROPER
Any good points of entry?
McCall shakes his head.
MCCALL
The place is designed to be a vault.
Roper picks up the cellular phone. It dials automatically.
ROPER
(into the phone)
My name's Roper. How are you people
doing in there?
(he listens)
Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm
the guy authorized to give you
whatever you want.
(listens)
That's right, but first I need to
come down there to talk to you.
We don't see anything but the suspect on the other end of
the phone. He's wearing a ski mask and gloves. Totally
unrecognizable to the audience. We will find out soon that
he is, in fact, Korda. He appears very cool and collected.
KORDA
You don't have to come here.
ROPER
Yes, I do. That way there's no
misunderstandings. I need to make
sure no one's hurt, then we can take
care of business.
A long pause... Then a bit sinister.
KORDA (V.O.)
Alright, Roper. You want to come...
come.
ROPER
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta
operate on trust here. We're going
to wrap this up and have you guys
out of here as soon as possible.
Roper clicks off the phone. He already doesn't like the sound
of this guy.
Everybody watching through the window.
The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda.
His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five
very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The
male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO
SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER,
gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against
the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The
guard and one of the jewelers.
Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler
and motions to the dead bodies.
KORDA
Drag them behind the counter.
The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the
grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The
older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of
reality. Her eyes are a bit far away.
Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't
been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass,
reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open
satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones
and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to
her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She
starts walking toward the front door frowning with
dissatisfaction.
WOMAN CUSTOMER
I'm not staying here another minute.
SALESGIRL #1
(panicky)
No, Mrs. Dotson.
Korda rushes around the display case.
KORDA
Come here, hag.
He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags
her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a
step toward Korda.
MANAGER
Leave her alone!
Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her
unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.
KORDA
You're a brave one, aren't you?
The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks
about making a run at him.
SALESGIRL #2
(pleading)
Sit down, Doug.
A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with
the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old
woman. Korda looks down at her.
KORDA
If she's not conscious when it's
time to leave, I'll have to kill
her.
Korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of
the gems.
Roper and McCall at the window, attention fixed on the store.
The Explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store.
Parks at a slight angle. The uniformed police officer gets
out, leaving the engine running, and walks off back to the
barricade.
ROPER
Okay. Time to give this fucker a
call.
Roper picks up the phone, waits. Everybody tensely watching
the store.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
A sniper team watching the store from a third floor window.
Roper holding the phone. It's still ringing.
The phone is still ringing.
ROPER
This fucker's not answering.
Just then, the front door of the jewelry store swings open.
A spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway. Korda is
discharging a fire extinguisher.
MCCALL
There's your answer. He's smart.
ROPER
He's cutting down the visibility.
MCCALL
And doing a very good job of it.
A thick cloud of white hangs over the sidewalk obscuring the
front of the jewelry store. Roper puts down the phone.
MCCALL
Come on. Give us one clean shot.
SWAT CAPTAIN
(into his radio)
All positions, you have the green
light.
MCCALL
They're out.
Roper grabs a pair of binoculars.
HIS POV
Through the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled
around the figure in the ski mask. They slowly shuffle toward
the Explorer.
McCall watches intently.
The figure in the ski mask leans slightly and Roper catches
a glimpse of the hostage right behind him. Roper recognizes
him instantly.
ROPER
It's Korda.
McCall sees him now, too.
MCCALL
They switched clothes.
Roper drops the binoculars and grabs his police radio.
ROPER
(urgently)
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Too late. A SHOT rings out. The figure in the ski mask goes
down, hit by the bullet.
ROPER
Shit! Where'd that shot come from?
Hold your fire!
More SHOTS ring out.
DOWN ON THE STREET
The white vapor cloud swirls. The hostages, spattered with
blood, scream and scatter. The figure in the ski mask lies
dead on the sidewalk. Korda, dressed in the manager's three
piece suit, holding the satchel of jewels in one hand and
his gun in the other FIRES back at the snipers. He grabs
salesgirl 1 and drags her into the Explorer.
Roper sees Korda move toward the car with one of the hostages.
MCCALL
He's got the girl.
ROPER
Damnit!
As Roper turns into the room he notices a set of keys on
Solis' desk.
ROPER
(grabbing the keys;
to Solis)
Are these yours?
SOLIS
Yeah, they are but...
ROPER
(to McCall)
Come on!
As Roper and McCall move toward the door...
SOLIS
Roper, what are you going to do?
Don't take my...
And Roper and McCall are gone.
SOLIS
...car.
DOWN ON THE STREET
Police come rushing onto the street. Guns drawn. The Explorer
ROARS off down the block. Roper and McCall burst out of the
command center building, leap into Solis' Cadillac and tear
off after the van. McCall is behind the wheel.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
The salesgirl is terrified. Korda checks the rear view mirror.
No one on his tail... At first. Then the Cadillac comes
speeding up behind...
Roper and McCall have the Van in sight, about a block ahead.
Roper picks up the radio.
MCCALL
Suspect heading west on Sutter now
passing Jones. Can we get an
intercept?
A voice comes back.
VOICE (V.O.)
R-32-David. We are proceeding south
on Hyde. Will intercept.
Korda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view
mirror. The Cadillac is making up ground.
UP AHEAD
a squad car SCREECHES into the intersection and smokes to a
stop. Korda jerks the wheel, pulls a SCREAMING right turn
and heads up the hill.
Korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the
windshield as they head straight downhill. The salesgirl is
beyond petrified.
THE CADILLAC
reaches the top of the hill. Going fast.
As it rocks forward violently. Front bumper slamming against
the pavement. McCall sees the van ahead. Hammers the
accelerator. No fear.
VAN
Korda sees traffic ahead... Intersection jammed. He pulls a
hard left.
THE VAN
cuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk...
shears a mailbox... a row of newspaper machines fly through
the air... The van speeds off down a one-way street...
THE CADILLAC
arrives at the intersection a few seconds later...
Intersection still jammed... People now standing on the corner
gawking at the damage. The Caddy SCREECHES to a stop. McCall
HONKS... The people scatter... The Cadillac drives through
the corner.
THE VAN
Wrong way down a one-way street. Cars coming right at us in
every angle. Frantic HONKING. Salesgirl SHRIEKS. Tires
SMOKING... No way to avoid collision... Except Korda pulls a
left an instant before impact... The van speeds back up the
hill.
THE CADILIAC
Down the same one way street... Comes up on the head-on
traffic, now stopped, paralyzed with fear from the near
collision with Korda...
Korda, checking the rear view mirror. The Caddy is a short
distance behind. Attention still focused behind, Korda enters
an intersection, running a red light... CROSS-TRAFFIC...
Korda stiffens... Pulls on the wheel
THE STREET
The van swerves... But not quick enough... GRINDING metal...
SHATTERING glass... The van rolls over another car...
BRIEF CUT - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
Korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a
dizzying roll...
THE VAN
...and CRASHES back down to the street upside down. After a
beat, Korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of
jewels. The salesgirl does not emerge. He spots a cable car
reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend.
He heads toward it...
As Korda comes toward them from the wreckage, some of the
passengers view him uneasily.
THE CADILLAC
hits the top of the hill just in time for Rope and McCall to
see Korda leap onto the moving cable car.
CABLE CAR
other passengers give Korda room. They can sense that he is
not here merely for the ride. Korda looks out the back...
Roper and McCall haven't lost track of him. The Cadillac is
making up ground on the cable car.
Korda moves to the back exit, pulls his gun and FIRES off a
couple of shots at the Caddy.
A bullet fractures the windshield. McCall swerves.
BACK ON THE CABLE CAR
That makes up the minds of many of the passenger. They leap
off the cable car.
Korda takes aim on the Caddy again and FIRES!
The brakeman charges down the aisle while Korda has his
attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off
the cable car...
Almost works... but Korda is able to hang on by one hand...
He swings around toward the Brakeman who turns involuntarily
as he sees the barrel of the gun pointed at him... BANG!
Korda shoots him in the back.
The brakeman staggers down the aisle and slumps across the
brake lever, releasing it more.
The cable car barrels through... Plows into two cross-traffic
cars... Knocks them aside... Keeps picking up speed.
THE CADILLAC
Weaves through the wreckage... Makes up ground on the cable
car, trying to pull alongside.
THE CABLE CAR
For the moment, Korda is not shooting at the Caddy. His
attention is now focused downhill as...
KORDA'S POV
The cable car nails another vehicle sending it spinning off
to the side.
THE CADDY
dodges the spinning car... Jumps up onto the sidewalk...
Mows down parking meters... Jumps back onto the street.
THE CABLE CAR
Korda leans out the door, takes aim at the Caddy... Another
jammed intersection up ahead...
He sees the cable car coming in his rear view mirror. He
bails out...
THE CABLE CAR
SLAMS into the back of the car. Major impact.
THE CABLE CAR
Korda and the passengers are thrown to the floor.
THE REAR-ENDED CAR
Tumbles down the hill... Hits a car coming uphill and rolls
into a parked car.
THE CADILLAC
Speeds up alongside the cable car. Roper climbs over the
windshield, onto the hood and leaps onto the cable car.
Korda sees him coming. FIRES. Roper dives out the other side
of the cable car.
CABLE CAR
Roper hanging off the side. He gets his gun out of his
holster...
Up ahead, a car pulls away from the curb...
Roper swings around to get back into the relative safety of
the cable car. As he does his gun is raked out of his hand
by the car which avoids a collision by a millimeter.
CABLE CAR
Korda aims as Roper re-enters...
CABLE CAR
As it CRASHES into the back of a car turning left.
Everyone is thrown toward the front of the car. Korda's gun
goes flying. Roper dives on top of him. They trade punches.
McCall is in b.g. with the Caddy pacing the cable car.
INTERSECTION
Pedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks
through...
THE CABLE CAR
Roper hammers Korda into unconsciousness. Outside McCall is
honking and yelling like crazy. Roper looks over... McCall
points ahead...
ROPER'S POV
The cable car.
ROPER
Leaps to the brake lever. Pulls on it.
ANGLE UNDER THE CABLE CAR
The clamp tries to slow the descent. It whine and smokes...
Then disintegrates before our eyes.
THE CABLE CAR
Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car
is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop
it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy...
He lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down
on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car...
McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the
steering wheel hard right...
Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position.
He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He
glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over
the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the
garage... Footsteps maybe.
Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun...
Lots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to
the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans
beneath the cars... No sign of Korda.
Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van...
Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward
the window.
A dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth...
Roper moves on.
NEW ANGLE
As a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps
into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The
BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution.
Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30
year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat.
ROPER
Sorry, go.
INSIDE THE CAR
The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives
off.
Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final
scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might
have escaped.
He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires...
Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives
and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield.
The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the
path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make
it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear
window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail
and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it.
GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL
As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and
piles into a parked car.
Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel
of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck.
Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the
satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car
door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his
gun right up between Korda's eyes.
ROPER
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
kill you right here.
Korda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't
kill him in cold blood...
What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about
those rules at this moment.
ROPER
You know Sam Baffert was a friend of
mine. He had a wife... and he had a
daughter.
Korda stares past the barrel of the gun.
KORDA
I don't give a shit about you or
your fucking friends.
And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all
inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night.
He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter
against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing
this guy.
KORDA
You can't kill me like this.
ROPER
What if you and me got into a
struggle... and my gun went off?
In a flash, Roper points the gun upward and fires off a SHOT!
ROPER
Could I kill you then?
(beat, beat)
Could I kill you then?
Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin. A pull of the
trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull.
And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed.
Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst
out of his skin.
ANGLE - MCCALL
moving across garage into position.
MCCALL
Roper! Put it down!... Put it down
man, we got him.
(beat)
Come on... Put it down.
Long, long beat. Roper eases up and Korda smiles. Just when
we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks
Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls
his head back and shoves the gun in his face.
ROPER
We do this shit by the book, but you
ain't gonna be smiling.
Korda is doubled up coughing, spitting up blood. Roper walks
away as McCall moves in to put the cuffs on Korda.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Roper is sitting in a cubicle doing paperwork. A group of
reporters and photographers move down the hallway adjoining
the squadroom. One of them is Ronnie. Through the glass walls,
she notices Roper sitting alone at the computer. She bids
good-night to the reporters and comes into the squadroom.
RONNIE
You weren't at the press conference.
Roper keeps tapping away at the computer.
ROPER
I wanted to get this out of the way.
RONNIE
You got a bet on the game tonight?
ROPER
As a matter of fact, I do.
She nods knowingly.
RONNIE
It's already started.
ROPER
I was going to catch the last half
on TV.
Ronnie watches him for a moment. He stops typing, looks at
her and smiles. She suddenly becomes self-conscious. Guess
it was something she was thinking.
RONNIE
Good-night.
She turns abruptly to leave. Roper finds himself rising from
his chair.
ROPER
You having dinner with Mr. Baseball?
She turns back around.
RONNIE
Greg is on a road trip. I was just
going to make some pasta.
He takes a few steps toward.
ROPER
That kind with the garlic and the
oil that I like so much?
RONNIE
No. The kind from Kraft, with the
macaroni and the cheese.
ROPER
I've been craving that stuff all
week.
RONNIE
And it's hard to get.
He looks at her innocently.
RONNIE
Just dinner.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Ronnie is making macaroni. Roper helps to prepare a dressing
to go with the salad. He is mixing oil, vinegar, sugar and
spices. He lets her have a taste.
ROPER
What do you think?
RONNIE
Mmm, needs a little something.
ROPER
What are you talking about? This is
it. This is the stuff right here.
(beat; he tastes)
Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
RONNIE
Yeah that's it.
ROPER
Why don't you just stick your finger
in and stir it up.
RONNIE
(laughing)
Scottie...
There is a long pause as he looks at her.
ROPER
What would you say if I quit gambling?
Ronnie stirs the macaroni.
RONNIE
I'd say you'd be miserable... It's
not the gambling. It's what the
gambling got in the way of. The track
is where you'd take your troubles
instead of sharing them with me...
Ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni. There is a beat before
she continues.
RONNIE
Scottie, remember the day you lost
that hostage in union square. You
came over that night and we made
mad, crazy love. But I didn't even
know what happened... 'til I heard
it on the news the next morning.
ROPER
It's because I wanted to keep you
away from that world.
RONNIE
It's not that world. It's your world.
It's part of who you are.
ROPER
(beat)
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I
don't know if I can change overnight.
But what I'm telling you is that I
want to share everything with you,
because I don't ever want to be
without you again.
The dog yawns. They laugh. Roper moves closer to her. He
kisses her and she responds.
The lovemaking is over. Roper is gazing at the ceiling,
thinking. Ronnie is cuddled around him. A comfortable
moment...
ROPER
What about Greg? What are you gonna
tell him?
RONNIE
It's okay. We broke up.
ROPER
(surprised)
When?
RONNIE
Just now.
Clarence Teal, Korda's cousin sits in front of the plexiglass
wall. He's edgy, fidgety. Clarence doesn't like to make visits
to jail.
Korda, wearing prison clothes, is led in by a guard. Korda
takes a seat at the other side of the plexiglass wall and
picks up the receiver. Clarence picks up his receiver.
CLARENCE
How ya doin', man?
Korda grips the phone, leans forward and stares through the
wall.
KORDA
You gotta do something for me...
this fucker, Roper, he's gotta
girlfriend. She works at the
newspaper. I want you to take care
of her.
Clarence is totally unnerved by this request.
CLARENCE
Hey, Michael, that's not my thing.
Korda glares at him murderously.
KORDA
You gotta do this for me. I'm in
here because of you.
CLARENCE
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you
were robbing a store. It wasn't
personal. It was his job.
KORDA
(exploding)
Fuck you! You know what he did to
me?!...
Korda starts to draw the attention of the guard. He controls
himself, lowers his voice. But the viciousness is still there.
KORDA
He held a gun to my head and said he
should kill me right then... He made
me...
He doesn't finish that thought.
KORDA
You do this for me Clarence.
Clarence is getting very upset.
CLARENCE
Don't make do it, Mike.
KORDA
Are you going to turn on me too? Who
helped you when you were strung out?
Who gave you money? Who bailed you
out of jail?
CLARENCE
I won't get away with it.
KORDA
Nobody knows who you are. Make it
look like a robbery.
Clarence holds back tears, because he knows he's going to
have to do this.
She's cooking some kind of sauce. She has a taste.
Ronnie pours some oil in a pan. The phone RINGS. She crosses
the kitchen to answer it.
Roper on his cell phone. Paco is on the seat beside him.
ROPER
Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner
for some wine.
Roper notices the rain, searches for the windshield wiper
switch.
RONNIE
How's Paco doing?
ROPER
He was going nuts at the park. He
met this very attractive poodle.
They made plans to meet again next
weekend.
Paco sits there panting. Roper pulls the pickup over in front
of the store.
RONNIE
Okay, dinner will be ready when you
get here.
She hangs up.
Ronnie lifts the lid on the sauce. Stirs. It spatters on her
blouse. She regards the stain with dismay. Puts the lid back
on and leaves the kitchen.
Ronnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the...
She takes off the blouse, goes to the closet door... throws
it open. She looks around. Something's not right. She takes
a step into the closet and finds what she's looking for -- A
laundry basket -- tucked away in the corner. She puts the
soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a
hanger. She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to...
Dark. She turns on the light. She goes to the mirrored
medicine cabinet.
IN THE REFLECTION
Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so
slightly. She opens the medicine cabinet. Takes out some
perfume. Dabs some on her neck. She puts back the bottle and
closes the cabinet. We fully expect someone to be standing
right behind her in the reflection... There's no one there.
She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom.
Ronnie walks back to the kitchen... Notices something on the
floor further down the hallway... What is it? She moves
closer... And now we get to the POV that tells us someone is
in the house... Watching her through a cracked doorway.
BRIEF CUT
A hand opening a buck knife. Water drips from the fingers.
BACK IN THE HALL
Ronnie bends down. It's a wet spot. Like half a shoeprint.
She reaches down to touch it...
BUZZZZZ!!!! The oven timer. She hurries back to the kitchen.
She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the
oven. She puts it down on the counter and cross to the
refrigerator. She opens the door and looks inside. The
refrigerator door obscures half the FRAME... She digs around
for something... We're sure that when she closes the door,
he's going to be behind it... She takes out a head of lettuce
and... Closes the door... Still no one there.
She turns... Clarence is standing there. Dripping wet. Ronnie
shrieks... The knife flashes forward... She grabs the lid
from the sauce pan and CLANG... Fends off the blade. She
bolts for the hallway. Clarence grabs her by the blouse...
RIP! She pulls away.
IN THE HALLWAY
She races down the hall. Clarence lunges into FRAME. She
goes down... He goes down... the knife goes skidding down
the hallway... Ronnie scrambles to get it... Clarence has
her by the ankle... She claws for the knife... Just out of
reach.
A QUICK SHOT of Clarence's hand grabbing the knife.
Roper kicks open the door. Charges in.
Ronnie is laying on the floor, gasping for air. Choke marks
around her throat. Roper rushes to her side. Paco is on his
heels.
ROPER
You okay?!
She nods. Points out the back way.
ROPER
(to Paco)
Stay.
The dog obediently stays with Ronnie. Roper dashes out the
back.
Korda is led in again. An expression of surprise registers
on his face when he sees who's waiting for him.
KORDA'S POV
Roper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall.
KORDA
Dons a smug expression and takes a seat. He picks up his
receiver as Roper picks up his.
ROPER
If you try again to hurt me or anyone
I know, I'm going to have you killed.
Korda feigns total innocence.
KORDA
What in the world are you talking
about, Mr. Roper?
Roper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the
glass.
ROPER
Here's a picture of your cousin
Clarence. That gentleman standing
over him is the coroner.
Korda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His
countenance is now a study in hate.
KORDA
I used to have an apartment, a car,
jewelry. I had a fucking eight
thousand dollar watch. Now look what
I have.
He motions around.
KORDA
You're threatening me? You think I
give a fuck? You think you can scare
me off?
(a laugh)
Why don't you come in here and kick
my ass? Get some of your guard friends
in here to help. I'd like that.
Roper glares at him mounting rage.
KORDA
(smirking)
He really shook you up, didn't he?...
I've got ten years worth of appeals
to figure out how to fuck with you.
Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer
will get me out on a technicality.
Roper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless.
KORDA
You came here to threaten me? That's
a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me...
Go ahead. Get down on your knees.
Roper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against
the plexiglass wall.
ROPER
You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill
you!
The guard rushes over and restrains Roper. Wrestles him away
from the glass wall. Roper pushes him off and gathers himself.
He gives Korda one last stare. Korda sits there smirking
back at him... Roper turns his back and walks out.
McCall is practicing his negotiating techniques in a mirror.
MCCALL
I'm here to help you.
Not quite right. He adjusts his stance. This time puts a
little hand movement into it.
MCCALL
I'm here to help you. Talk to me.
He's still not satisfied.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Captain Solis pokes his head in the door, he's been looking
for McCall.
SOLIS
We got a situation at the V.A.
Hospital. The responding officer has
requested a negotiator.
MCCALL
Where's Roper?
SOLIS
He's on his way. Get over there.
Leading to the roof. A COUPLE OF COPS and MEMBERS OF THE
HOSPITAL STAFF peek out at the vet as he continues to rant
and rave. McCall arrives at the top of the stairs. OFFICER
#4 sure looks happy to see him. McCall takes a peek out onto
the roof. He isn't happy about what he sees.
OFFICER #4
When we got here, he was already
doing his balancing act. I was talking
to him, but it made him more agitated
so I backed off.
MCCALL
Why is he up there?
OFFICER #4
Something about a microchip in his
brain.
MCCALL
Who is he?
A NURSE answers him.
NURSE HERRIN
David Adler. He likes to be called
Dave. The other guy is Walter
Sinclair.
We hear the urgent cry of the vet in the wheelchair.
VOICE (V.O.)
Somebody help me out here. Somebody
stop him.
The nurse turns to McCall.
NURSE HERRIN
What are you waiting for?
MCCALL
Another negotiator is on his way.
NURSE HERRIN
We can't wait for another negotiator.
You have to do something.
MCCALL
What about the doctors?
NURSE HERRIN
He hates all the doctors. He says
they're in on the conspiracy.
VET #1 (O.S.)
Where is everybody? He's going to
kill me!
McCall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof.
The crowd is dispersing. Roper is talking with some of the
other cops. McCall storms out of the Vet Hospital and down
the stairs. Roper moves toward him.
ROPER
McCall!
No response. McCall gets into his ND Sedan car and fires it
up.
ROPER
McCall!
Roper races over and manages to jump in just as the car
screeches away from the curb.
BAY BRIDGE - DAY
McCall doesn't even seem to have registered that Roper is in
the car with him. He drives. Stone-faced. Roper studies him
for a beat.
ROPER
Where are we going?
Moving POV thru windshield of car, we see a freeway sign
that says "Golden Gate Racetrack."
McCall pounds over to the betting window. Roper leans up
against the window beside him. Watches.
MCCALL
Give me a twenty dollar four-six
exacta.
TELLER
The six is scratched.
This throws McCall for a beat.
MCCALL
Then give me a fucking four-seven
exacta.
The teller punches out the ticket. McCall takes the ticket
and pounds over to box seat area. Roper follows a couple of
steps behind, giving him some space.
It's a small interview room. Korda sits opposite bail bondsman
JOHN HAWKINS (white, grizzled, forty).
HAWKINS
What the fuck... You bring me all
the way over here to tell me you've
got no collateral! What do I look
like to you -- Santa Claus? I'm a
bail bondsman!
KORDA
No, no, see what I'm sayin' is, I've
got the --
HAWKINS
Pick up a fucking phone for chrissake!
You think I got time for this crap?
KORDA
Hey, hey, I got shit on the outside.
I got somebody cashing it in for me
and --
Hawkins gets up and goes to the door.
HAWKINS
Gimme a fuckin' break.
KORDA
Alright, alright, look, man, look,
just leave me your card. I can get
it to you by tomorrow night.
Hawkins looks at him skeptically for a beat. Then pulls out
his BUSINESS CARD and hands it to him. He walks out the door
as we HOLD on Korda -- pocketing the card.
CLOSE-UP of a glass of wine being poured. PULL BACK to reveal
Roper and Ronnie all dressed up for a special evening. The
waiter hovers as Roper tastes the wine.
ROPER
(snootily)
It has a nice "nose".
WAITER
The special this evening is braised
sweetbreads with a white truffle
sauce on cracked bulgar.
Roper looks at him a long beat.
ROPER
That's my favorite.
(smiles)
Why don't you give us a minute.
The waiter retreats. Roper looks across the table at Ronnie
as she sips her wine.
ROPER
You like this place?
RONNIE
It's very nice.
ROPER
I guess you realize that there's
something special that I want to
talk to you about.
She didn't realize that. Now she's getting nervous.
RONNIE
There is?
ROPER
For the last week things have been
going pretty well between us. I think
we've been doing a good job getting
intimate and all that stuff...
Now she's really worried.
RONNIE
Yeah?
ROPER
...Let me just show you.
Roper reaches into his coat pocket.
RONNIE
Scottie, we should think this over
before we...
He pulls out two airline tickets.
ROPER
Tahiti.
Ronnie is immensely relieved.
RONNIE
Ohhh... A vacation... Yeah that sounds
like a great idea.
Roper notices her relief and for the first time realizes
what she was thinking.
ROPER
Oh you thought I was going to ask
you...
Ronnie averts her eyes, a bit embarrassed.
ROPER
Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to
Tahiti first and see if that works
out...
Roper picks up his menu and peruses it.
ROPER
I assume you're having your usual --
the "air dried venison".
The wheels of a laundry cart, moving slowly down the hall. A
white metal door slides open, and the cart passes through.
As the cart rolls into the room TILT UP to see
KORDA
pushing the cart. He stops. A GUARD (guard #3) stands with
his back to Korda. He's on the phone.
KORDA
Got another load.
JAIL GUARD #3
Rack 'em up.
(into the phone)
Look, man, if it doesn't make it
down here by five it's not my problem.
As the guard continues, Korda hangs several garment bags,
zipped and tagged, onto an ELECTRIC TROLLEY -- similar to
the kind used by dry-cleaners to move clothing.
KORDA
All done.
Korda pushes a button and the trolley STARTS TO MOVE. The
guard, still on the phone, buzzes open the door.
ON THE GUARDS BACK
We hear Korda wheeling the cart out the door.
CLOSE ANGLE
on the door sliding shut.
ON THE GUARDS BACK - CLOSE
Hold a beat. PANNING SLOWLY around the room to FIND -- suit
bag's moving on the trolley. BOOM DOWN to FIND Korda's feet
just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the
bags.
ANGLE ON KORDA
hanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then
down through an opening in the floor and into...
as it loops around a large room, carrying him toward the
back wall. The metal ridges of the trolley CUT into his
fingers, drawing blood. Then he drops down, and quietly
rummages through other bags of clothing. He tries on a pair
of pants but they come up to his ankles. He looks like he's
about to go wading. As he rips them off and reaches for
another pair...
CUT TO:
Korda appears around a corner, dressed in street clothes,
holding a CLIPBOARD -- moving steadily toward camera.
KORDA'S POV - DOWN THE HALLWAY
A female civilian EMPLOYEE heading in his direction. As they
pass he nods and she nods back. Then Korda passes through a
door at the end of the hallway and into...
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
The door closes behind him and locks with the loud SNAP of
metal.
Slowly, with deliberate steps, he moves down the corridor
toward the door at the other end, past the first GUARD (guard
#3) -- enclosed in bullet proof glass.
TRACKING - KORDA'S FEET
step by step. The voices of prisoners, muffled behind thick
glass.
CLOSE ON KORDA'S FACE
trying to stay cool, his heart pounding. Then...
A VOICE (O.S.)
Hey!
Korda FREEZES, then slowly turns to FIND... A prison GUARD
(#1) moving toward him.
THE GUARD POV - MOVING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO KORDA
KORDA
...Yeah?
The guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand.
JAIL GUARD #1
You dropped your card.
Korda takes THE CARD given to him by the bail bondsman.
JAIL GUARD #1
You guys are the scum of the earth.
KORDA
Just tryin' to make a living.
Korda turns and walks out the door into...
It's the final step before getting out of the building. A
small room with another GUARD (Latino; guard #2) behind glass,
and several TV monitors. A BLACK WOMAN (forty-five) is arguing
with a LATINO GUARD.
JAIL GUARD #2
I don't know what to tell you, mam,
your brother ain't here. Try San
Bruno.
WOMAN
I just came from San Bruno -- they
sent me here!
JAIL GUARD #2
I'm sorry. Then I don't know where
he is.
Korda, fidgeting behind the woman impatiently, holds up his
card...
KORDA
Listen, can I just sign outta here?
WOMAN
What do you mean, you don't know
where he is?! You can't just lose
somebody!
JAIL GUARD #2
(to Korda)
Who are you again?
KORDA
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta
be over at county in fifteen minutes,
alright?
JAIL GUARD #2
Johnny who?
WOMAN
(to Korda)
Can you believe these people?
KORDA
It's the criminal justice system.
What can I tell ya? It's a mess.
The guard shoves the sheet under the glass.
JAIL GUARD #2
Alright, alright, just sign.
Korda signs the sheet. The guard pushes a button. The metal
lock SNAPS, and the door POPS open. Korda takes his card and
sticks it in the woman's coat pocket.
KORDA
If you find him, gimme a call.
And Korda walks out.
Empty. New front door. Unpainted. Frame splintered from when
Roper shot it open. We hold a beat... HEAR ROPER & RONNIE
coming up the stairs. Laughing. The door opens. They enter.
ROPER
How come in those foreign movies the
young girl is always with some fat,
old guy.
RONNIE
In Europe women find older men very
sexy.
Roper closes the door.
ROPER
When I get old and fat, I'm moving
to Europe.
Ronnie suddenly remembers something.
RONNIE
I forgot to leave food for Paco.
He's probably starving.
She walks back toward the kitchen. Roper takes a seat on the
couch. Flips on the TV. Rubs the back of his neck.
ROPER
Damn, my eyes are tired from reading
that movie.
FOLLOWING RONNIE
She moves down the hall to the kitchen.
RONNIE
(doggie voice)
I'm sorry, Paco. I forgot --
But Paco isn't lying on his pillow like she expected. Curious.
RONNIE
Paco?
She turns around walks back down the hall... Where could he
be?... She walks into the bedroom.
RONNIE
Paco?
He's not in here either... She walks back into the hallway.
Frowns.
SUDDEN CUT
A figure leaps out of the bathroom doorway!... Big scare.
It's Paco. He nearly knocked her over. He stands on his hind
legs, paws on her shoulders. Breathing in her face.
RONNIE
Paco, have you been eating my face
soap, again?
RACK FOCUS
Roper standing at the other end of the hallway. Tense as a
wire. Gun at his side. One look at his demeanor tells Ronnie
something is very wrong.
RONNIE
(very concerned)
What is it, Scottie?
Roper untenses. Puts away his gun.
ROPER
Korda escaped.
RONNIE
And you think he'll...
Her voice trails off. He can see she's worried now, too.
ROPER
Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's
relax. I'm sure he's just going to
try to get out of town. Anyway we
leave tomorrow.
He puts his arms around her waist.
ROPER
Why don't we do some of that European
movie stuff.
She puts her arms around his shoulders.
RONNIE
I don't think you're old and fat
enough for me.
ROPER
Use your imagination.
Roper is still very edgy.
ROPER
It's better if you stay inside.
She climbs up the stairs toward him.
RONNIE
You've got to calm down --
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Roper reaches the top of the stairs.
ROPER
Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go.
Time to get movin'.
Roper moves into the room, listening. There's no response.
ROPER
(continuing)
Ronnie?
She doesn't answer. He calls out again, moving through the
living room.
ROPER
(continuing)
Ronnie, where are you? Time to go.
No answer, the room is very quiet. Roper eases his PISTOL
out from under his shirt, moving more urgently now, checking
out the bathroom, bedroom...
ROPER
(continuing)
Ronnie.
Then he HEARS Paco, WHINING. He moves around the entrance to
the kitchen. The back door is open, Paco standing in the
doorway. Roper rushes forward, quickly looking outside, the
alley way empty. He senses a presence behind him, spinning...
McCall standing in the doorway to the kitchen.
Roper's lowers the weapon...
ROPER
(continuing)
She's gone.
McCall sees on the kitchen table, a folded piece of GLASSINE
PAPER, just like the one Korda gave Roper at the jewelry
store.
MCCALL
(nodding)
Scott...
Roper sees it, approaching, barely able to unfold the edges,
a momentary tremble in his hand.
ROPER
That son of a bitch. If he...
We PUSH IN as his fingers open the paper... revealing inside
a MICRO CASSETTE TAPE.
ROPER
(continuing; to himself)
He's fucking with you, Scott, be
cool... keep your head.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON a TAPE RECORDER, Korda's VOICE heard over the
speaker.
KORDA (V.O.)
(filtered)
I got your lady, Roper.
(laughs)
Roper and McCall are listening closely to the tape.
KORDA (V.O.)
(continuing)
You got something that belongs to
me, and I want it back.
(beat)
Twelve-fifteen, Mare Island, North
Entrance off Dixon. Building twenty-
eight, by the dry docks.
(beat)
I so much as smell another cop, I'll
be sending you parts of this bitch
for a month.
Roper punches off the tape.
ROPER
He's gonna kill her no matter what.
If I take him these jewels he's gonna
kill me and her.
MCCALL
So what do you want to do?
ROPER
That's a chance I gotta take.
MCCALL
Then we better get moving... But
there's no way we can get the jewels
out of evidence.
Roper stares at him, the wheels beginning to turn...
CUT TO:
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Roper is standing at the counter to the steel-caged property
room. On the other side is FRANK, the property sergeant on
duty. The two men speak in hushed, urgent tones...
FRANK
Scott, we go back a long way but you
can't expect me to do this!
ROPER
Frank, this guy is a psychopath and
he's got Ronnie. It's the only way
I'm going to get close to him.
FRANK
Then go to the Lieutenant or the
D.A. with it, for Christsakes. You're
asking me to put my fucking job on
the line!
ROPER
They'll never approve it, you know
that. Besides, I involve the
department and she's dead. I got one
chance with this guy, Frank, alone.
(beat)
He killed Sam and he'll kill her.
Frank just stares at him, compassion and anger tearing at
him.
ROPER
(continuing)
What if it were Mary?
(beat)
You'd break every fucking rule in
the book... wouldn't you?
Frank continues to stare at him, a long beat.
FRANK
I hope to God I never have to make
that decision...
He pushes back from the counter.
FRANK
(continuing)
...and this conversation never
happened. I never saw you today. Now
I gotta go take a leak.
He turns and walks away. Roper looks down, SEEING that the
drawer beneath Frank's counter has been left slightly open.
Roper reaches over, easing it further open -- inside a set
of KEYS. He looks around, then takes the keys.
ROPER
I owe you one, Frank.
He walks down the hallway.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON the SATCHEL Korda used in the robbery.
WIDEN TO REVEAL Roper and McCall, Roper at the wheel, McCall
reading a folded MAP featuring MARE ISLAND.
MCCALL
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard,
cranes, high buildings... he'll be
in place where he can see everything.
(to Roper)
How are we going to get me in there?
ROPER
Good question.
Roper thinks a moment, then turns, looking out the back of
the pickup, in the bed a loose CANVAS TARPAULIN. He and McCall
study the tarp a beat, then turn, looking at each other...
As he rounds a corner, approaching the dry dock area, huge
CRANES and mothballed SHIPS in the b.g. He parks near a
building, a weathered SIGN reading: BLD 28. Roper shuts off
the engine, leaving the keys in the ignition. Taking the
satchel he opens the door.
KORDA'S POV through the filthy windows, Roper far below,
standing beside his pickup.
POV TELESCOPIC SIGHT: Focusing on Roper, his lips moving...
McCall, heaving for breath, has just dropped down into
position, providing a view of Roper and the inside of the
glass fronted building.
MCCALL
Right here, Scott.
He touches the LASER SIGHTING attachment to his scope, a red
beam activated...
ROPER - DAY
From inside the building Korda's VOICE:
KORDA (O.S.)
Get your ass in here, Roper.
Just as Roper starts to move he SEES the red laser DOT on
the back of his hand -- McCall is up there, right behind
him. Roper moves inside.
MCCALL - DAY
Lying prone inside the operator's booth, steadies his RIFLE,
looking through the scope.
TELESCOPIC POV: He can see Roper enter, his field of vision
limited inside the building where the light penetrates, the
room cast in HARD SHADOWS.
He MOVES to the windows, all either painted white or so
obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes
and shadows inside. He MOVES BACK to the opening, Roper now
just inside.
MCCALL
Stay cool, real easy...
Cavernous and dark, a jungle of huge MACHINES, LATHES and
EQUIPMENT once used in the design of nuclear submarines.
Roper moves a few feet inside, remaining in the light and
keeping his face in three-quarter profile to McCall's
position.
ROPER
Where is she, Korda? I want to see
her.
From the darkness beyond...
KORDA
Walk to the table.
Roper walks to a steel SHOP TABLE.
KORDA (O.S.)
(continuing)
Open your shirt.
ROPER
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just
between you and me.
KORDA (O.S.)
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
Roper puts down the satchel, unbuttoning his shirt, holding
it open.
ROPER
Satisfied?
KORDA (O.S.)
Open the bag, dump everything on the
table.
Roper opens the bag, the JEWELRY and the dozens of GLASSINE
ENVELOPES spill out onto the table. He lays the satchel on
its side, the bottom facing Roper. Taped to the bottom is a
short barreled .45 AUTOMATIC.
ROPER
It's all there.
KORDA (O.S.)
Spread it out.
Roper spreads the pile out across the top of the table.
ROPER
Only the jewels, Korda, you've got
my word.
A long beat...
KORDA (O.S.)
Show me something.
Without looking Roper reaches to the pile of GLASSINE
ENVELOPES...
CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND
Palmed in his hand, the ENVELOPE containing Ronnie's diamond.
Roper, without looking, 'digs' into the pile, holding up the
GLASSINE ENVELOPE between his fingers, still holding the
palmed envelope. He starts to toss the envelope in his
fingers...
KORDA (O.S.)
(continuing)
Not that one.
Roper hesitates, then drops the envelope, his hand moving
over the pile...
ROPER
(continuing)
Right there, the one in front...
yeah, that one. Toss it.
Roper reaches for the envelope.
CLOSE ON ROPER'S HAND
As he flips the palmed envelope into his fingers with the
skill of a card shark, exchanging it for the one Korda
indicated. He tosses it across the room...
From the shadows Korda's hand reaches out, picking it up. A
long beat.
KORDA (O.S.)
(continuing)
I'm impressed. I didn't think you
could do it. What did you have to
do, steal them?
ROPER
Yeah.
KORDA (O.S.)
(wry)
That's not going to look too good on
your service record.
ROPER
I'll worry about that. Let's get on
with it.
Korda LAUGHS as he slowly emerges from the darkness.
KORDA
My sentiments exactly.
Korda moves closer to the light, tossing an ATHLETIC BAG to
Roper, in his hand an AUTOMATIC PISTOL.
KORDA
Fill it up. Just in case there's a
homing device in the other one.
Roper slides the jewels into the second bag, eyeing the .45
on the bottom of the satchel.
KORDA
(continuing)
Now bring it over here.
Roper hesitates, but all he can do at this point is play for
time, he moves forward...
Roper growing closer to Korda's position.
KORDA
That's far enough. Bag on the floor.
Roper hangs onto the bag -- there's 'four million in jewels'
in there -- all he has to bargain with.
ROPER
I've kept my end. Ronnie first.
Korda reacts in mock surprise.
KORDA
Oh, shit, in all the excitement I
almost forgot. She right here...
A LIGHT SWITCH is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming
ON, illuminating a massive FLAT BED CIRCULAR LATHE. Roper's
eyes in horror go to...
RONNIE
Tied to the lathe bed spread eagle. Some distance from her
body a CUTTING DEVICE is positioned over the lathe bed.
Roper looks into Ronnie's terrified eyes.
ROPER
Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you
out of this.
He turns back, Korda grinning at him.
KORDA
No shit, this I gotta see...
Korda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held
down with TAPE.
Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN,
very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table
keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade.
(PRODUCTION NOTE: Lathe will be cutting into a section of
steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to Ronnie.
Korda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases
his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it.
We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation',
his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at
this point.
KORDA
(continuing)
Fuckin' cool, huh? I rewired the
switch. You see, you have to keep
your finger on the button or the
little lady gets cut...
He releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting
device. He stops it again, holding the button.
KORDA
(continuing; grins)
Right in half.
He eases towards Roper, extending his arm on the control
box, holding the button down.
Korda holds the control box towards Roper.
KORDA
But then, that's not my problem.
He releases the button and the box, the lathe turning, Korda
grinning at Roper...
Roper moving to the control box, pressing the stop button,
stopping the lathe...
KORDA
You see, it's out of my hands.
Roper looks at the box, Ronnie's life literally in his
hands...
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Now Korda reaches his car, hopping inside, STARTING it up.
In desperation Roper looks back at the satchel, then turns,
calling out...
ROPER
McCall, stop him, stop the car!
Korda REVVING the engine...
Korda at the end of the long building, beginning to
accelerate.
ROPER
Turns toward McCall's position...
ROPER
McCall!
The CAR now screaming down the long corridor...
The car now closing in on Roper, but Roper holds his ground...
ROPER
McCall, shoot the son of a bitch!
Korda bearing down on Roper.
KORDA
Bye, bye, cop...
ROPER
Holding his position, eyes widening in fear...
The bullet punches through the window, catching Korda's left
shoulder, BLOOD flying. Korda whips the wheel in shock...
Spinning out of control, hitting a table piled with MACHINE
PARTS, sending them flying...
But the car is now swapping ends, still flying right towards
Roper, who can't move...; who won't move.
The car flies past him, the SIDE MIRROR catching Roper's
shirt, tearing it, a flash of BLOOD from his arm...
The car then collides with a series of PIPES crossing the
floor, STEAM erupting in every direction as the car then
slams into several PROPANE BOTTLES stacked near the benches,
a series of EXPLOSIONS ripping through the building. . .
ROPER
Thrown to the floor by the explosions, releasing the button,
as...
THE CAR
Hits the GLASSED-IN ROLLING DOORS.
On the floor, recovering. He catches a quick glimpse of the
bottom section of the lathe, a GEARBOX, the gears turning...
THE LATHE
Turning, the cutting blade inching towards Ronnie...
ROPER
Staggers to his feet, grabbing the control box, pressing the
button... nothing happens, the lathe still turning, SPARKS
coming out of the box, it's SHORTING... Only a few more
seconds...
Desperately his eyes search the floor, SEEING a HUGE WRENCH.
He grabs the wrench, jamming it between the GEARS in the
gearbox, the gears shuddering violently, threatening to crush
the wrench...
Roper runs to Ronnie's side, frantically pulling at her bonds,
the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her...
THE GEARBOX
Hammering and clanking, the wrench can't last a heartbeat
longer...
ROPER
Pulls the last of the restraints away...
THE GEARBOX
Just as the massive gears crush the wrench, the table
turning...
THE LATHE
The blade passing directly over Ronnie's position as Roper
hauls her away, holding her in his arms.
Roper holding Ronnie, easing her away from the still turning
lathe.
RONNIE
Scottie, Scottie...
ROPER
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
HEARING the shots outside, hauls Ronnie out of the way,
keeping her low to the ground.
ROPER
Stay here, don't move.
RONNIE
Scottie...
ROPER
Do it!
He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then
crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom
of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the
cavernous, machine-choked building.
