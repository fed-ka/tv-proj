          An upscale duplex on a quiet residential street.  Trees
          cast long shadows under the glare of security lights.



          As Johnny opens it to reveal Dana, now wearing the business
          suit she put aside before and looking away pensively. 
          But she quickly dons a game face as she turns to Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.  Come on in...

                                        DANA
                        I'm sorry I'm late...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not at all...

          As he escorts her in...

                                        DANA
                        You're very nice to do this for
                        me...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I owed you one, remember..?

                                        DANA
                        I think this could be a cover
                        piece for the Sunday Magazine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        'My Dinner With Johnny'.

                                        DANA
                        You have to admit a date with a
                        psychic is a pretty good pitch
                        for a story.
                                (beat)
                        Not that this is a real date.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (understands)
                        Just a pretend date.  For your
                        story.

                                        DANA
                        Oh...
                                (takes out a wine
                                  bottle)
                        For dinner.  The "sommelier" at
                        my local liquor store says Merlot's
                        a good choice with duck.

          But as Johnny takes the bottle --



          parked with the ferris wheel in the background... Santo
          and Johnny play on the radio...



          Country music filters through a grill in a wall as camera
          pans to find Max and Saundra somewhat drunkenly and roughly
          making out.  He has her up against the wall, while her
          hands are under his shirt, pinching his nipples.  He
          groans, comes up for air.

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Like that, don't ya, cowboy?

    36CONTINUED:36

                                        MAX
                        You're a bad girl, and I'm gonna
                        do bad things to you.

                                        SAUNDRA*
                        You mean right here, right now?*

                                        MAX*
                        Well, I'd invite you back to my
                        farm but...

          And they both laugh -- it's already an old joke -- as
          Saundra finishes for him:

                                        SAUNDRA
                        ...the bank repossessed it.

          Back to the rough making out.  And in breaths in between:

                                        SAUNDRA
                        At least you're not thinking of*
                        your girl anymore, hmm?  'Course,*
                        who knows what she's up to.

          And she's just teasing, but Max reacts -- a subtle shift
          in tone.

                                        MAX
                        What do you mean?

          Saundra heedlessly plows on.

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Maybe we're not the only ones
                        being bad tonight.  Could be she's
                        getting her revenge on you, too,
                        you know.

          And suddenly Max has one hand pinning her throat to the
          wall, though his tone is still almost mild, and scarier
          for it.

                                        MAX
                        No.  All I know is you're a cheap
                        little whore who'll turn a trick
                        for a coupula shots of bourbon.

    36CONTINUED: (2)36

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Hey!  You bastard!  Let me go! 
                        You're hurting me.

                                        MAX
                          I thought you liked it rough,
                        isn't that right?

          And he slaps her like we saw him slap Dana in his visions,
          only this time while holding Saundra against the wall
          with his other hand.  And then slaps her again.  And again. 
          Harder and harder.

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Stop it!  No!  Please...

          But he's choking her at the same time and the words are
          strangled.  And then his hand draws back farther...


          ANGLE ON HIS HAND

          as it comes back into frame... and closes into a fist! 
          And as the fist flies forward out of frame --


          BLACK SCREEN

            A disorienting beat as camera pans from an area of deep
          shadow to a bed and we realize we're back in:



            A nondescript SEDAN rounds a corner, and heads down the
          street (and while at first we may not recognize this street
          from the Teaser, we'll eventually realize it's Dana's).

                                        WALT (V.O.)
                        Car is a dark-colored, late-model
                        sedan, possibly Ford Taurus or
                          Chevrolet Caprice...

          And the description matches the car we're watching, as it
          parks by the curb (and we may also see the license plate,
          which also matches, as it pulls to a stop), across the
          street and about fifty yards from Dana's building.

          The static from Walt's walkie-talkie now becomes static
          on a CAR STEREO inside:          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT FOUR - 6/12/02 - WHT-2  45.





          As he opens the door for her...

                                        DANA
                        I'm sorry.

                                        JOHNNY
                        For what.

                                        DANA
                        Just a general, cover-all-bases
                          apology.  Apply to all affected
                        areas.

                        Friends when we meet tomorrow?

          She touches his elbow with the only intimacy she has left
          to muster... and as she does...


4949A JOHNNY FLASH - THOSE TWO BRIGHT BLINDING LIGHTS


  5050RESUME

          Johnny reacts and she notices.

                                        DANA
                        Don't tell me.

          Dana leaves...

    50CONTINUED:50

                                        JOHNNY
                                (grins)
                        Good night, Dana.

          He watches her for a beat, then closes the door.  He walks
          back through...



          Johnny finds himself standing in the middle of the street
          as Max guns his car right at him.  Johnny's briefly
            paralyzed... and Max drives right through him, as if he
          were a ghost.  Johnny whips around just as there's the
          SOUND of a car raking alongside parked cars, an ugly
          THUMP... turns to see the car speeding away and Dana lying
          on the street... as the vision ends...



          Rounds the same corner Max's did, and continues up the
          street, passing Max's car.  As it does, we match shots
          from Johnny's 'shard' flashes plus --



          Turns and shields her eyes as the headlights hit her,
          just as Johnny saw in his vision.          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT FOUR - 6/19/02 - GRN-2  53.



          Surges forward.  But before he's gone more than ten yards,
          Walt's Cruiser, lights flashing, skids to a stop in front
          of him.  Max stomps on the brakes, skidding to a stop as
          well, and before he can do anything else, Walt is at his
          window, gun out and leveled at Max's head.

                                        WALT
                        Turn off the ignition, then get
                        out real slow, hands where I can
                        see 'em.


          ANGLE ON DANA

          as she watches all this from a distance... a beat later...


    6666JOHNNY'S JEEP

          roars around the corner... comes to a stop by Walt... who
          has Max out of the car and is cuffing him, as he glances
          over at Johnny in his Jeep.  (Note: Johnny's cut hand has*
          been hastily wrapped in a cloth napkin.)*

                                        WALT
                          Everything's under control.  Thanks
                        for the call.

          Johnny acknowledges, looks over at Dana who is shaken. 
          Her eyes connect with his.  She realizes that Johnny
          probably just saved her life.  Johnny drives over and
          parks behind her car.


          CLOSER ON THEM

          He's still behind the wheel. For once in her life, she
          doesn't quite know what to say.  Off her silent look...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You left before desert.

                                        DANA
                                (words, no real
                                  meaning, as she
                                  studies him)
                        I'm watching my figure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Naw, what kind of dinner would it
                        be without desert?

          Johnny gets out of the jeep.  Dana looks over to where
          Walt is shoving Max in the back of his cruiser.

                                        DANA
                        The lights...

                        the whole picture.

                                        DANA
                        You were throwing plates after I
                        left?*

                                        JOHNNY
                          Dropping not throwing.

                                        DANA
                        Better.

          Max gives Dana a last angry look before Walt shuts the
          door.

                                        DANA
                        He scares me.  But in a way, you
                        know, you scare me more.

          And we're going to choose not to explain that line to the
          audience aloud but what she means by it that he's someone
          that might break through her defenses, touch her - to use
          the Johnny metaphor - in an intimate way and that scares
          the hell out of her.  But she's willing to take the risk...

                                        DANA
                        C'mon.  I've got a pint of Ben &
                        Jerry's in my freezer.  Desert's
                        on me.

          She holds out her hand.  And as Johnny takes it, and they
          walk away... we pull back and up to see Walt's car taking
          Max away... maybe hear some radio traffic about getting a
          tow truck out there to tow Max's car away... and as Johnny
          and Dana go inside...

                                                                              FADE OUT.
