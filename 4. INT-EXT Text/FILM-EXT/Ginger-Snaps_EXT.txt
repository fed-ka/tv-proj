The house is dark. The moon is almost full. A dog barks.
A melancholy voice, worn for its age, narrates:
BRIGITTE (V/o)
Ever try bein' different? An, I
don't mean jus' thinkin' about
it, either. Ginger an' me - I
mean I...
The house numbers read 669. The 9 slips: the number now
reads 666.
BRIGITTE (CON'T/V/O)
Ginger an' I? Went for different.
Big time.
There's a light on in a basement window. We creep up to it,
crushing the tulip. borders on the way. The window is propped
open with a sneaker: it looks like somebody's foot is caught
in it. Music plays inside-
It's a beautiful autumn day in suburbia. Birds sing. The
terrier next door (NORMAN) barks and barks.
A pierced navel is stretched taught, filling with blood.
Ginger's limp body is bent backward over a low fence. Blood
is flowing from where she's been speared through her chest:
Ginger's impaled on a white picket.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Don't get me wrong. It's not
like we were all happy or
nothin' to begin with.
Brigitte takes a long, ponderous drag on her cigarette as -
unmoved - she takes in Ginger's mortal wound. Brigitte eyes
the identical homes and gardens that stretch on to the
horizon.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
The suburb of Bailey Downs?
Basically a well lit black hole.
The Kingdom of cul du sac.
That's French for Dead End.
Brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves.
It smolders then goes out. She scowls.

BRIGITTE (V/O)
You had a gram of personality
out here? Life bit the big one.
A truck with COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM on its side pulls up a
few houses over. Brigitte watches a shirtless sun-bronzed
Adonis - SAM -- climb out of the cab.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Of course I'm generalizing.
A tarty teenage girl - TRINA - bounds up to Sam and gives him
a big wet one.
BRIGITTE (V/0)
No I'm not.
GINGER
The fuck, Bee. Take a picture
already.
Brigitte raises a 35mm still camera to her eye and frames her
sister's corpse in the viewfinder.
ROLL HEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE:
snap! A slide of Ginger - dead on a white picket fence -
smashes on. The HEAD CREDITS are superimposed on each of the
slide images:
snap! Ginger sliced up with an electric knife in the kitchen,
Snap! Ginger drowned in a bubble bath,
Snap! Ginger hanged by nylons in the laundry room,
Snap! Ginger mangled under the front tires of a mini van.
PICTURE TITLE: GINGER SNAPS.
The twenty or so participants in this all-girl gym class
stand ready at centre field in lacrosse padding and helmets.
Brigitte and Ginger stand apart from the others, sharing a
smoke. Brigitte looks scared. Ginger looks ill.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
After two weeks a' high school.,
ya come to the conclusion it's
all about agony. Take Phys. Ed,
sus' practise takin' pain.
The gym teacher. M7.,. SYKES - an aging former-traffic cop -
hucks the players sticks with nets on one end. Sykes is given
to screaming.
SYKES
Field lacrosse is no pussy-assed
tea party, ya get IN there, get
a LOCK on your target and PUSH
IT! I want SWEAT I want ACTION!
The Trinas giggle at Sykes. Ginger bends forward, holding her
sides.
1 1
MZ.SYKES
Shake a leg, Fitzgeralds. An,
butt out, you gotta death wish!?
GINGER
Feel really sick, Mz. Sykes.
MZ. SYRES
Cigarettes'll do that for you!
Move!
Ginger flicks the smoke at Sykes' turned back. It falls
short, of course.
The sisters trudge to their places on the field. Ginger is on
the offensive line. Brigitte is in goal.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Phys. Ed. is not optional at
Bailey High.
Sykes blows the whistle. A fast-moving, hard-hitting
lacrosse scrimmage begins.
IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Ginger gets caught in the crunch of
sticks and bodies, pushed, kicked, and punished by the
Trinas, who are having 'fun'.
IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Brigitte visibly cowers as a tangle of
marauding, ball-whacking bodies descend on her. She takes a
number of direct hits from the hard rubber ball.
on a powerful press for a goal, Trina slams into Brigitte so
hard Brigitte flies right out of the net area. And skids
face-first .into a mangled dog's body.
The whistle blows and play stops. Ginger lopes over,
breathless, gripping her sore stomach.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I been waiting for this. There'd
been a lot of dead dogs around
lately, but this was my personal
first.
Brigitte slowly climbs out of the mucky canine remains to her
knees. She's covered in doggie guts and maggots.
TRINA
Oh, HOW GRO-O-O-O-OSS!!
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 1 2
The class edges toward them, but maintains a horrified
distance. Even Sykes struggles with a gag reflex on seeing
Brigitte' s mess.
Brigitte fingers the dog's remains with a look of
fascination.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
'Kay, here's the weird thing
about me. I dig dead stuff. Live
things make me sick, they're all
warm and snotty and shitty and
pissy. And live things jus'
suffer, which I can't take. But
a dead thing? S'kinda beautiful,
'cause a dead thing's really I
dunno -like, free.
SYKES
Don't TOUCH it, Fitzgerald!
What's WRONG with you two?!
Get up and hit the SHOWERS!
TRINAS IN CHORUS
The cult? Drains the blood out
and drinks it, ya know! /1 heard
they have sex with them first !
/Gawd stop, you'll make me PUKE!
BRIGITTE (V/0)
Everyone was all like, Oh it's a
teen cult, or aah, it's some
looney, the Beast a' Bailey
Downs. What crap.
SYKES
All RIGHT, ladies, settle! This
is no joke! You have information
about the dog deaths you do
WHAT!
CLASS IN CHORUS
(by rote)
Tell a teacher, Principal
Fardor, or the police.
BRIGITTE
Teen cult my ass. Look Ginge',
something went for its throat -
it's not cut, it's chewed...
Brigitte looks up in time to see Ginger's eyes roll back in
her head. Ginger faints. The class inhales as one.
1 3
BRIGITTE
Ginger?
Sykes and the class stampede up. Sykes pushes Brigitte out
of the way.
BRIGITTE (V/0)
Ginger's no pussy. She doesn't
faint. I might faint. Like, if
this pooch were only HALF-dead,
I could faint.
Brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass. She hugs herself.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Here's a dirty word.
Inevitability. That fate fully
intended us to be typical in any
way, sooner or later, was so
insulting.
Ginger and Brigitte trudge homeward looking completely
depressed. Brigitte flips through the feminine hygiene
calendar. Ginger watches the pavement beneath her feet.
BRIGITTE
(reading a panty-
liner ad)
"Some days it's all you need."-?
What does that mean?
GINGER
So you pulled a Quincy on that
dog, unh?
BRIGITTE
Hunh?
Ginger grabs the calendar and sticks it in her pocket.
GINGER
Quincy, that guy with the stiffs
on cable. Alls I remember is you
goin', "Teen cult my ass".
BRIGITTE
Oh. Right. Well, I dunno.
Brigitte shrugs. She gives Ginger a funny look.
GINGER
Why are you looking at me like
that? Do I look - different?
BRIGITTE
No.
GINGER
Can you tell I'm going to-?
BRIGITTE
No. .Really.
Ginger squints at her, unconvinced.
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 1 6
GINGER
Wham. Total adultness. How can I
have a miracle of nature an, not
be old enough to drive! fiurih?
The fuck.
Ginger kicks a kiddie toy hard into a yard. Brigitte doesn't
have an answer to this.
Their house looks like a set in a home show. The girls take
it in from the front drive with expressions of complete
weariness. Next door, Norman the terrier barks at them.
GINGER
Hey. If I start simpin' around
tampon dispensers and moanin'
over cramps, or even think about
buying somethin' that says Baby
Powder Fresh? You'll. shoot me,
right?
BR TG.'i"I'L
of course.
They exchange grins.
GINGER
Out by sixteen
BRIGITTE
.or dead in this scene.
Ginger raises her hand and Brigitte smacks it hard. As they
mount the drive, Ginger picks up a stone and hucks it at
Norman, who's still barking. She misses.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
If we failed to get a life by
Ginger's sixteenth birthday? we
were s'posed to gas ourselves in
the garage. For smart girls, we
could be pretty dumb. we prob'ly
never woulda done it, but we
seemed to need a deadline.
The girls sniff around the playhouse. Ginger steps on
something that makes an evil squeeshy sound. She skids and
ends up on her ass.
GINGER
This is so not my day.
Brigitte helps her to her feet. Ginger shakes what she
slipped on off her shoe. It's a long, ropy intestine. She
drags her shoe to get the blood and goo of it.
GINGER
Nice. Dog shit.
BRIGITTE
(thrilled to
recognize the smell)
That isn't shit... it's death.
A line of blood and gore trails across the grass to a back
lane. Brigitte follows it. Ginger looks around for something
on the ground.
GINGER
Great. Lost the jay. Great.
Ginger joins Brigitte, who's squatted before another dog's
body. This one's a fresh kill.
BRIGITTE
Ack, it's still warm, gross.
Brigitte takes its picture FLASH! with the Polaroid, which is
strung around her neck.
GINGER
Why every dog but the mutt next
door to us?
BRIGITTE
Hey, we could take it home. Try
like, an autopsy. Like, crack
the case!
GINGER
Nah. Let's put ' im in there so
he won't. Lraumatize the kiddies.
23
Ginger indicates a construction dumpster on the end of the
lane. Disappointed, Bee rolls down her sleeves to cover her
hands. Ginger does the same and they shovel the body onto
their arms.
They trot the dog over to the dumpster. Brigitte sulks.
GINGER
What.
BRIGITTE
We never do what I wanna do.
GINGER
Oh, c' mon. Would stink up the
whole room!
They hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster. It's hind
end sticks out. Brigitte climbs into the dumpster, dragging
it all the way in.
Dusting herself off, Ginger notices some blood on her thigh.
GINGER
Nice.
Ginger wipes at the blood with her hand. More appears. She
lifts up the hem of her skirt. Her face falls. She looks
around. She slips her fingers up to her crotch. Her hand
comes out bloody.
GINGER
Bee. I JUST got the curse.
Brigitte stops rooting garbage over the dog.
BRIGITTE
Serious?
Ginger wiggles her wet fingers at her.
GINGER
We gotta go home.
BRIGITTE
Eeew, 'kay.
Brigitte catches her kilt on a nail sticking out of a plank
in the trash.
Something is crunching through the leaves toward them. Ginger
peers out into the darkness.
24
GINGER
Hurry upt
BRIGITTE
I'm stuck3
A few homes down, a garage's motion-sensitive security lamp
trips on. Ginger squints, blinded.
GINGER
Bee?:
Brigitte contorts to deal with the nail. Brigitte tears her
hem free and jumps down. The light snaps off.
GINGER
(indicating the
opposite direction)
Let's go this way.
Brigitte dips a hand back into the dumpster for the plank
with the nail. Off Ginger's look, Brigitte shrugs.
They start walking down the lane. The greenery behind them
starts swelling again. The leaves crunch, faster.
Brigitte and Ginger look at one another, and walk faster. The
lane empties behind a deserted strip mall.
Whatever is behind them knocks an empty trash can over.
Brigitte grabs Ginger's arm, scared.
BRIGITTE
This is stupid. We're getting
farther from home.
Ginger is pissed off now. she turns to confront their
stalker.
GINGER
(to the darkness)
All right you ass-/
She's cut cold by a roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth
and claws: SOMETHING takes Ginger down hard.
We cannot see it as a whole, we can't make out what it is.
It's big, heavy, and raging. Immense jaws snap vicious teeth,
going for Ginger's jugular. Brigitte drops her plank.
25
GINGER & BRIGITTE
BRIGITTE/GINGER!!!
Brigitte grabs and kicks at the creature. Ginger raises her
arms and covers her head, screeching and kicking. The thing
grabs Ginger by the scruff and shakes the living daylights
out of her.
GINGER
BEEEEEI HELP MEEE! BEEEEE!!!1!
Brigitte snatches up the plank with the nails. Brigitte
brings it down hard on the thing, screaming. She smacks it
once, twice. The plank pops a shot off the camera: FLASH! A
horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for a
split second in the light.
The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off,
snarling.. Brigitte quakes with the board raised, ready. The
thing skitters before her as she screams.
Ginger scrambles to her foot and grabs Bee with bloodied
hands.
GINGER
Go-go-go-go-go-go!!!!
Brigitte drops the plank and they run like hell.. for a main
thorough-way ahead. It pursues them.
The late-night traffic is light but consistent. The thing is
still, coming.
At a dead run Brigitte and Ginger sail between moving cars.
The thing burns behind them.
The girls are barely missed by an approaching truck. There is
a long blast of a horn.
Then a sickening thud. Brakes squeal incto a stop as a
horrible dragging/ scrain fills the night air.
The girls crash to the sidewalk, spilling over top of one
another. They glance over their shoulders, even as they
disappear into a new residential stretch.
The COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM truck sits at a right angle in
the road, it's front end smashed.
26
Sam slowly opens the cab door. He staggers to the bloody
grill, clearly shaken.
He looks under the truck, and follows a wet trail of gore
back behind it to the mangled furry mass about twenty feet
back. He takes it in, stunned.
Then Sam vomits.
It's noon hour. The grounds are full. of teens.
Brigitte is eating as she ticks off the fourth day in
Ginger's feminine hygiene calendar. Brigit:Le counts 28 days
from the first check mark. Her pen hovers over the date:
Halloween, arid the next full moon. The first day was a full
moon. Brigitte slowly circles them both.
Ginger wears long sleeves to hide her bandages, and shades.
She's looking BOYS up and down as they pass. Ginger's stomach
is growling. An untouched sandwich sits on her lap.
BRIGITTE
Gonna eat that?
Ginger shakes her head as she picks at her bandages. Brigitte
helps herself.
BRIGITTE
Mmm! Sad, but Pamela's egg salad
is her best thing. Like that she
can do.
(no response)
Like, when she puts the baby
onions in?
(no response)
And she gobs on it and adds
those hard little pieces of
BOOGER
Ginger pulls at her own crotch.
31
BRIGITTE
Hell-o 1?
GINGER
Sorry. Pads suck, so ya know.
BRIGITTE
Should eat something.
GINGER
Thanks Pamela, I'm aware.
Off Brigitte's insulted look,
GINGER
T dunno, I'm all blaaahh, I got
this, like I can taste what I
want, but nothin's it. Ya know?
Brigitte stops in mid-chew.
BRIGITTE
A craving?
GINCER
Yeah. I crave. Ya know?
Brigitte chews very slowly as she stares at Ginger. Ginger
squints at Jason and his pals across the yard.
GINGER
McCardy's a stoner right?
BRIGITTE
Yeah -?
GINGER
C'mon, I wanna feel better.
BRIGITTE
You joke.
Ginger heads off toward the boys - without waiting. Brigitte
is in mid-,mouthful, and has to scramble to catch up.
Jason and his pals' butcho conversation sputters as Ginger
strides up like a cat in heat. Brigitte stumbles up behind
her, keeping her distance.
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1998 32
JASON
Uh - hi.
GINGER
Hey. So. Nice day, blah blah
blah. Got any smoke?
JASON
What?
GINGER
Smoke. Grass, weed, dope, green,
bud, Nancy.
JASON
Sh-sure.
GINGER
Wanna share?
Brigitte hesitates before a rusted-out old boogie van, it's
rear door open and waiting. Blue smoke billows out. of the
interior. Brigitte looks confused.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
I was all like, so who are you,
an' what have you done with my
sister, right?
Brigitte climbs in.
Ginger is over the fence with ease. Norman barks more,
harder.
Brigitte can't vault the fence. She clambers up a shared tree
at the fence line to see.
Ginger tries to grab the dog but he dances around her,
barking like crazy. She grabs his snout with her bare hands
and he bites her hard.
GINGER
Sonnovabitch!
Now livid, Ginger takes up a dead tree branch.
Up in the tree, Brigitte hides her face in her hands.
Ginger (:racks the stick over the dog's head. The yelping
stops but Ginger keeps hitting. Blood splatters over her
face. And Ginger tastes it.
Ginger drops her stick. She drags the body into the hedge
next to the fence.
Brigitte lowers her hands from her eyes. Ginger is directly
below her, concealed from the house by the shrubs.
Ginger falls to her knees before the corpse. She lifts a
rattling hand to touch him. She lowers her face to the bloody
mess. She's sweating, vibrating, physically resisting an
irresistible drive. Ginger's tongue slips between her lips.
And Ginger licks Morely's body.
BRIGITTE
Oh. No. G-ginger -!
Ginger begins to eat the dead dog. The feed. quickly becomes
a ravenous frenzy.
Above her, Brigitte leans over the branch she's barely
balancing on, hyperventilating.
Vomit sails down from Brigitte's perch.
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15, 1996 44
The porch light comes on behind Ginger.
BR IG ITTE
Shit.
Brigitte scrambles down the tree and yanks Ginger off the
dog. Ginger's face is smeared in blood. Ginger's stunned, and
reels dizzily. They crouch, waiting.
Their NEIGHBOR opens the screen door, shaking a box of dog
biscuits.
NEIGHBOR
Dore-maan! Tweat-time! Hunh.
The neighbor steps into the yard. Approaches the hedge.
Stops right before them - they can see a pair of slippers
twitching in the grass. Then they disappear, the porch light
switches off, the screen door shuts.
Bailey Downs sleeps soundly as the hunt begins. The moon is a
sliver of its former self.
Ginger cocks her head at the sound of a dog barking. She
lifts her nose into the wind and sniffs. Ginger is prowls
like a wild cat through yards and service lanes, as
A study in much less stealth, Brigitte stumbles, trips and
slips after Ginger. Splits her sweats climbing fences. Loses
a shoe over garage roofs, gets caught in automated lawn
sprinklers, falls into hidden cellar window troughs, as
A series of dogs perk their ears and snarl from their dog
houses, chains, and porch perches...
Low whistles and smoochy sounds lure the dogs into bushes,
behind cars, around fences. Strings of dogs' chains strain
tight, then slacken...
Ginger - wild-eyed, bloody-mouthed, and euphoric - tosses
collars at Brigitte. Brigitte misses most of the tosses. She
picks up the collars and fingers these souvenirs with
disgust.
INSERT:
A LITTLE KID decked out for hockey practice waddles into his
yard with a full dog food dish. His feet squish along his
pet's entrails. He finds his dog's body and drops the dish
with a clatter on the cement patio.
KID
M-m-mMOMI?
CUT BACK TO:
Days get ticked off on the feminine hygiene calendar...
BRIGITTE (Vb0)
We became the Beast of Bailey
Downs. We got good..
The moon vanishes, then reappears in as a First Quarter, as
Brigitte's getting the hang of things, she practices expert
surveillance from car roofs, throws stones to trip motion-
sensitive lamps, starts moving like a super spy, taking
crime-scene style Polaroids of their victims, as
48
Ginger's kills get quicker, she gets wilder, more daring,
more ruthless, and...
Brigitte gets cooler, confident, collected. She's mapping out
attack routes and leading the frothing Ginger to the big
scores, like dog kennels...
BRIGITTE (V/O)
The more we did, the crazier she
got...
Under a swelling moon Brigitte and Ginger tear around in the
dark, screaming and laughing and rough-housing.
JUMP TO:
INT GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
Brigitte shoves a fist-full of collars under their
mattresses.
JUMP BACK TO:
On the field, Ginger climbs up on the goal post and walks
carefully across the narrow beam.
JUMP TO:
BRIGITTE (V/O)
The crazier she got, the more
she needed me. I liked that
part.
In their room, Brigitte helps Ginger shave her back. Ginger
trims her elongating nails. Brigitte plucks hairs from
Ginger's palms. Ginger brushes her teeth and a piece of tooth
comes off - she has a little fang.
JUMP TO:
on the field both Brigitte and Ginger hang upside down from
the goal post by their knees. Brigitte is wearing a dog
collar as a necklace. They are laughing their heads off and
trying to pull each other's shirts down to expose each
other's breasts.
GINGERSNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996
49
All the kids lounging on the grounds double-take the
Fitzgerald girls' entrance this morning.
Ginger is babe-alicious in a hot tiny tee, boots, shades and
very short shorts. She projects unbearably untouchable.
Brigitte flanks her without the wardrobe, but the attitude is
there.
GINGER SNAPS -WALTON
Jason gapes as Ginger heads toward him with an unlit smoke
between her pointy teeth. She leaves an inch between his
chest and her breasts.
GINGER
Got a light, Jace'?
Jason and his pals all fumble for lighters and five little
flames appear before her smoke. She lights her smoke on
Jason's, and exhaling looks him up and down. The boys flames
go out, all at once.
GINGER
My sister would like one also.
obediently, they all light up for Brigitte. Brigitte falters
before the attention. At Ginger's nod, Brigitte lights up
too.
TRINA (O1S)
Slut.
Ginger turns to see Trina and the Clones sizing her up.
GINGER
Excuse me?
Ginger seems to tower over the Trinas today. Trina can't
match the menace. Ginger exhales smoke in Trinals face and
climbs the steps into the school.
Brigitte double-takes Ginger's back. Ginger's spine is
protruding sharply through her shirt. Trina leers at
Brigitte.
TRINA
Better watch your back,
Fitzenstein.
Brigitte snorts and follows Ginger in.
BRIGITTE
(under her breath)
Like I'm scared.
INT ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
Ginger chews her nails like a dog does when cleaning them.
Brigitte and the rest of the class watch an RCMP OFFICER
holding a reward poster at the front of the room.
51
OFFICER
we need your cooperation. If
you know anything about the so-
called Beast of Bailey Downs,
call in. You can be anonymous.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Ha! As if they weren't already.
OFFICER (CON'T)
But your pets aren't safe until
the perpetrator is caught.
Ginger sighs loudly and Brigitte prods her.
The girls' gym class is prepping for lacrosse again. The
Trinas square off across the half-way mark from Ginger. Mz.
Sykes blows her whistle. The scrimmage begins.
Trina whips the Indian rubber ball right into Ginger's face.
Ginger drops her stick and launches herself at Trina.
Play stops with the whistle, but Ginger and Trina are just
going at it. Ginger's winning. Trina bites Ginger's sore arm
and Ginger rakes her nails over Trina's neck.. Ginger draws
blood.
Mz. Sykes breaks it up by dragging Ginger off Trina. Sykes
tends to Triria, who bawls.
Ginger wipes her bloody hand over her mouth.
BRIGITTE
Ginger!
Ginger's rolling the taste of Trina's blood around in her
mouth.
GINGER
Mmnun .
BRIGITTE
You can't do that, That's human
blood! .Feel anything?
Brigitte and Ginger stare at one another. Ginger first shakes
her head., but then nods. Ginger looks around and whispers
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 15, 1996 52
GINGER
It's sick but - I'm all like
horny.
Brigitte makes a sour face.
SYKES
Fitzgerald, bench!
GINGER
What, she started it!
Brigitte watches Ginger march to the sidelines, throwing off
her gear as she goes.
SYKES
Pick that stuff up!
Ginger gives Sykes the finger without looking back. Brigitte
groans.
Jason's van is parked on a rise that offers an impressive
overview of Bailey Downs. Crickets sing. The moon is rising.
57
Ginger slams the van door and rushes away from the van.
JASON (O/S)
Chicks, yer all the same!
Ginger stops in her tracks. She shakes her head and continues
away.
JASON (O/S)
Cock tease!
Brigitte shuffles along the curb, the picture of dejection.
She slows to watch Sam loading some enormous tree branches
into the back of his truck, packing up for the night: lie has
58
been cutting back an enormous tree in someone's front yard.
when Sam glances her way, Brigitte picks up her pace without
looking back.
Trina wears a radio headset that pounds post-disco dance mix
as she jogs. Morely dashes in and out of the surrounding
greenery. He dashes in once more, and does not reappear.
Trina looks back expectantly. She runs in place, waiting for
him. She heads back, looking for him.
Ginger pops out of the brush before Trina. Gingers face
smeared with blood from Mo.rely. Ginger grins insanely. Ginger
wiggles Morely's collar. Trina clicks off her head set.
GINGER
Hi!
INT FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - NIGHT
Brigitte descends the stairs to her room. Music blasts from
the basement.
PAMELA (O/S)
Brigitte? Tell your sister to
turn that stereo down!
Trina's body is wrapped in a bedspread and stuffed in a kid's
wagon. Brigitte is keeping a look out looking pale and
sickened.
Grass and dirt spray out of the playhouse. Ginger is digging
up the ground inside doggie style. She emerges, shaking the
turf out of her new paw.
They struggle to get Trina inside, but she's already too
stiff to bend up.
GINGER
Told you.
BRIGITTE
Rigor mortis. Knew we shoulda
skipped dinner.
GINGER
Can we do it my way now?
Brigitte hesitates, her anxieties rising.
BR IG ITTE
So is this it? You doin' people
now?
GINGER
She won't fit unless I
BR IG ITTE
You know what I mean. Just say.
GINGER
I din't kill her!
BRIGITTE
But were you gonna?
There is a long pause. Ginger tries to laugh it off with,
GINGER
No. I'm not doing people. No.
Brigitte takes a deep breath, nodding. She acts belief.
63
BRIGITTE
'Kay. .Hurry up.
Ginger drags a section of the body into the playhouse with
her. Disgusting gnashing and tearing, bones snapping and
other sounds of devouring are heard from within.
Brigitte keeps watch. Tears appear in her eyes.
The body is dragged another foot into the playhouse. Ginger
is eating Trina to make her fit in the grave.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Trina was dead. Trina was
dinner. This was BAD.An'I kept
wonderin' what Sam was doin'
right then. I couldn't help it,
he jus' kept poppin' into my
head, like.
CUT TO BLACK.
INT A FAMILY-SIZE FREEZER - DAWN
Brigitte lifts the lid of a large freezer. OUR POV IS FROM
INSIDE THE FREEZER. Its light illuminates the brown paper
parcels Ginger sets inside, next to the frozen waffles and
veggies. The parcels are labeled T-bone, T-thigh, T-breast.
BRIGITTE (V/0)
What Ginger couldn't finish we
froze, 'cause the less we left
for whoever would find Trina,
the better. Watch a lot of crime
TV, so.
Brigitte's sizing Ginger up behind her back.
Ginger finishes loading the freezer. Brigitte drops the lid.
CUT TO BLACK.
INT GIRLS' BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
The room is dark. Ginger is asleep.
Brigitte is in bed with her back turned to Ginger's bed.
Brigitte has a penlight on a collection of open monster
books. She is examining a sketch of a plant with yellow
flowers.

What:cha Join' ?
Brigitte nearly jumps into orbit, slamming her book shut as
Ginger appears over her shoulder.
GINGER
Hm. Big Book of Monsters, hunh.
Thought they were useless.
BR IG ITTE
They are. Couldn't sleep. So.
Rrigitte gives Ginger a nervous smile. Ginger smiles back.
Her fangs show.
Their alarm clock goes off reading 8:00 AM. Ginger's paw
comes down hard on it, cracking the plastic casing.
Brigitte is already up. She sweeps up the glass mess from the
night before.
Ginger rolls out of bed, steps over Brigitte and stumbles to
the bathroom. Ginger steps on tacks and doesn't even react.
GINGER
Man, I'm not getting enough
sleep.
Ginger closes the bathroom door.
Brigitte leaps to the door, looping one end of a noosed
extension cord around the handle. The other end is tied to
the door handle of the bedroom door. Brigitte checks to
ensure the latter is bolted shut.
65
OFF-SCREEN, the toilet flushes. OFF-SCREEN, Ginger tries to
open the door. She can't.
GINGER(O/S)
The fuck -? Beef
Brigitte watches the vibrating length of cord hold the door
firmly in place. Ginger bangs hard on the door.
GINGER
BEE!?
BRIGITTE
Ginger, don't be pissed...
GINGER
Open the fuckin' door you feeb.
BRIGITTE
No!
Ginger pounds on the door with great violence.
BR I( 'TF.
Want Pamela dc h, e?
The pounding Sto2s.
BRIGITTE
We have to stop it Ginge'. If we
can. I`ll be back before dark.
Brigitte tears the page with the plant out of her book and
leaves by the window.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Told Pammy Ginger wasn't feeling
well. Just to get her checkin'
regular on. her, keep the
pressure on Ginger to be cool.
EXT COUNTY GREENHOUSES - DAY
Brigitte steps off a county bus at the drive.
There's a police car parked next to the Sam's truck. She
looks back to the bus, but the doors swing shut and it pulls
away.
Brigitte smoothes her hair, takes a deep breath, and over-
acts innocent as she walks up.
66
INT COUNTY GREENHOUSE - DAY
Brigitte can hear male voices as she minces down the leafy
aisles.
COP (O/S)
It's in your best interests to
be cooperative.
SAM (O/S)
My lawyer's co-operative, I just
know my rights. I don't know
where she is, I'm very
concerned. That's it, unless you
got a warrant.
She ends up backing into a COP behind some palms.
BRIGITTE
Shhh-it! I mean, sorry.
SAM
(to cop)
You can see I got customers, so
if that's all.
COP
Okay. Sure. For now.
The cop gives Sam a final Dirty Harry squint and leaves.
Sam collects himself with difficulty. So does Brigitte.
SAM
if you skipped school lookin' to
score, I don't keep nothin' here
at work, sweetheart.
BRIGITTE
I din't. I mean I skipped, but-/
SAM
Hey. From Mccardy's van, right?
You know my girlfriend? Trina
Sinclair?
BRIGITTE
Rinda.
SAM
You seen her today?
GINGER SNAPS- WAI.TON/July 15, 1996 67
BRIGITTE
Not today...
SAM
Fuck. She's missing.
BRIGITTE
Oh. S-sorry.
SAM
Yeah, well. Cops think I know
where she is. I don't.
Sam looks Brigitte right in the eye. Brigitte is caught up in
him for a second.
SAM
Sorry, what do you care right?
What do you need.
BRIGITTE
Um. Lookin' for this.
She holds out the torn page. Sam takes it.
SAM
Aconitum lycoctonum? Sorry.
Brigitte yanks her own hair hard. Sam smiles.
SAM
Tryin' to kill somebody?
(off her look)
Well, you know it's poisonous,
right? Wolfs bane? Deadly. Be
like stocking hemlock an, shit.
BRIGITTE
No, I thought it did something
else. Doesn't matter.
SAM
Anyways they're perennials -
only flowers in spring.
Brigitte turns to leave, hot with frustration, huinilliation.
Sam watches her stamp toward the door.
SAM
Hey. Ranunculaceae come in about
a hundred species. I've gotta
cousin, monkshood. Not so toxic.
If you're interested.
66
Brigitte stops and considers him.
SAM
Don't know if it'd help.
INT GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
They sit together amidst beautiful plants and flowers. Sam.
picks a tiny purple flower from a bed of young plants and
hands it to Brigitte.
SAM
S'called monkshood 'cause people
used to think it kept 'em pure
from dirty thoughts. Seriously.
BRIGITTE
(EARNESTLY)
Make my life easier.
Sam laughs. Surprised by this, Brigitte smiles and hides
under her hair.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
This is awful. but the whole time
I was with him there? I din't
even think how I'd just put
pieces of his girlfriend in the
deep freeze, like, at all.
Ginger stalks past the neighbor's yard with the playhouse
where Trina is buried.
A new puppy romps. He sniffs around the edge of the
playhouse. He smells something. He starts to whine and dig.
Brigitte reaches the door and finds it locked. The door opens
a crack and Ginger's transformed arm grabs Brig.iLLe, hauling
her inside. The door slams shut and locks.
A truck's headlights pin them in full view. Ginger rolls her
sleeve down over her paw. Brigitte swoons as if she might
black out on the spot.
The truck's engine cuts and the doors slowly open.
JASON
Well, well well..
GINGER SNAPS -WALTON/Jufy 15, 1996 76
Jason and his pals climb out of the van. They hold beer
bottles: they have come here to drink.
JASON
The fair sisters Fitzgerald.
GINGER
Hey. How's it goin'?
JASON
You tell me.
Tim cracks the door and takes a look inside.
TIM
Holy shit - they trashed the
place!
The guys gawk: they are very impressed.
BOYS
Who--oooaa. Fuck, unbelievable!
JASON
Ginger, I had no idea.
GINGER
What can I say. I had an urgo.
JASON
Cool. But. This is ya know, uh,
a bit of a problem. What's gonna
happen when they start lookin'
for the ah, people responsible?
Brigitte glares at Ginger.
GINGER
You won't tell.
JASON
Oh I might.
GINGER
No you won't.
BRIGITTE
Ginger -?
GINGER
Shut up. Shut up.
(to Jason)
How ' bout a deal.
77
JASON
Have to be sweet.
GINGER
You keep our lil' secret and I
do you. All a' you.
Brigitte slumps against the wall.
JASON
TIM
JASON
Jason gets the eager nod from his gang.
JASON
Okay, let's go.
GINGER
Not now - I'm a mess. We're
(making this up as
she goes)
having a Halloween party at. our
place, Friday night. We'll do it
then.
JASON
Yeah, right Saturday. You'll
ditch.
GINGER
I won't ditch. But you guys say
a word about this to any one, -
and there's no action. So it's
up to you. You stay quiet, you
score. You don't - phhtt - nice
knowin' ya.
JASON
Deal.
He extends his hand to shake on it. Linger shakes it
awkwardly with her good hand. Brigitte thumps her head
against the wall.
Brigitte jogs up to the school. The yard is full of
students. Teachers are marshaling them into lines and seating
them on the grass. Brigitte plows through.
Ginger rides past, piggy-backed by Jason. Ginger completely
ignores Brigitte. Brigitte looks very worried.
FEMALE STUDENTS
Ginger Fitzgerald is such a
slut./No kidding./The bitch.
VARIOUS STUDENTS
You hear about Trina
Sinclair?/Dug her up in
somebody's back yard!/oh that's
so sad!/ Poor Trina, Ga-awd!
As Brigitte gets closer to the building, she finds police
cars and cops at the main entrance.
83
BRIGITTE
Shit.
PRINCIPAL FARDOR is speaking with the RCMP constable who has
been visiting classes. Fardor holds a hanky over his face.
FARDOR
That stench near the staff
offices, what is that you think?
Brigitte hedges up the steps toward the door.
OFFICER
I couldn't say, sir. Now is
there anyone you suggest we talk
to? Anyone with something
against the school?
Brigitte slips past the two men.
FARDOR
For god's sake look around you.
I got 350 angry young people
bored blind.Helluva day for my
goddamn cleaning staff to be
late ... . IIEY!
Brigitte stops at the threshold.
FARDOR
The hell you goin'?
BR IG ITTE
I left something in my locker.
FARDOR
Find your homeroom and wait.
School's outta bounds until we
call you in. Get!
Brigitte backs down the steps, looking like she just took a
good slap. She turns to confront the mass confusion around
her.
Brigitte spots Ginger dancing on the roof of a car in the lot
now, surrounded by boys. Brigitte spots Sam's truck near-by.
Sam is sit in his truck, slumped over the wheel. He holds an
almost-gone bottle of rye. Brigitte runs up.
84
Sam is crying. He doesn't see Brigitte arrive at his window,
so she turns to tip-toe away. Sam looks up. His eyes tell us
he's stoned.
SAM
Hey. Wolfs bane. Wanna drink?
Brigitte stops and turns to face him. Sam dries his face on
his sleeve and pops his passenger door. Brigitte looks around
and slides in.
Ginger is watching Brigitte out of the corner of her eye.
Ginger stops dancing a second. She is staring at Brigitte
and Sam in his truck. Her face darkens.
CROWD
C'mon Ginger! Take it off!
GINGER
You wish!
CROWD
Hey Ginger? Watcha doin' later?
Can we come to yer bash?!
Ginger stops dancing. Anger floods her face.
GINGER
You know about that?
GINGER SNAPS -WALTON/July 15. 1996
67
BOYS
Sure, everybody knows! Can I
bring my cousin?
Two more squad cars are gliding up the street toward the
school.
.Brigitte makes her way toward Ginger.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
fie was jus' drunk, I'm thinkin'.
I mean he prob'ly din't mean it.
Whatever.
Beyond Sam's truck, behind Brigitte, the two new cruisers
lurch to a stop. Cops approach Sam's vehicle with extreme
caution.
Brigitte arrives at the car with Ginger as,
GINGER
All a' you guys?! My house!
Tonight!
(very sinister)
I wanna party with everybody.
we'll do it till you drop.
68
CROWD
ALL RIGHT, GINGER:::! WHO00-
HOO!
The crowd applauds. Brigitte stares at Ginger like she's
watching a cruise missile coming in. Ginger notices Brigitte
watching her. Ginger pretends she doesn't see her.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
Ginger was gonna kill every one
of l em.
A commotion behind them causes everyone to turn.
Sam is being dragged from his truck by the cops. He is flung
face-first onto the hood and hand-cuffed.
COP
Sam McDonald? You're under
arrest for the murder of Trina
Sinclair.
Brigitte physically fights with herself not to yell out. She
runs a few steps toward Sam. Brigitte looks back at Ginger,
who drills her with an evil warning glare.
The cops shove Sam into the back of a cruiser. They roar
off.
Brigitte stands alone, apart from the crowd. The cruisers'
flashing lights disappear down the street. Brigitte turns to
face Ginger, mustering her own first menacing look.
Ginger accepts a cigarette offered by one of her boys.
BRIGITTE (V/O)
They closed the school that day.
So I never got to my locker. So
I never got the monkshood. I
thought, this is it. I fucked
up.
The full moon is just making an appearance.
Brigitte stands in the front room window, which is decorated
with a Happy Halloween paper sign and plastic bats.
Brigitte's watching Henry put Styrofoam tombstones in the
front yard.
Jason sits on the edge of Ginger's bed and bounces up and
down a bit. Between his legs we glimpse a dog tag hanging
between the mattresses.
TNT GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT
Brigitte tapes the gauze in place. Ginger throws a robe on
and grabs the door.
GINGER
Now get outta my life.
Brigitte grits her teeth.
BRIGITTE
I gotta get ready for the party.
GINGER
Then wait here till I'm done.
BRIGITTE
What, through all fifty a' them?
GINGER
Oh, don't tempt me.
Ginger takes a deep breath before she opens the bathroom
door. Her breath is ragged. She smoothes her hair and chews
her lip. She's nervous. Ginger opens the door and closes it
behind her.
GINGER SNAPS- WALTON/July 22, 1996 94
Brigitte hears,
JASON (O/S)
It's really dark in here.
GINGER (01S)
I'm shy. Lay down.
Brigitte puts the toilet seat down and sits on it. Brigitte
lights a smoke. Brigitte withdraws the monkshood from under
her shirt and has a good scratch where it was itching her.
OFF-SCREEN are the sounds of slurp kisses and Jason's moans.
A fly unzips. Clothes fall with soft plunks to the floor.
Bed springs creak. Plastic condom wrappers crinkle and then
the SNAP-WHAP of one being fitted on pretty roughly.
Somewhere above them the door bell starts ringing.
From a vanity cupboard she pulls a Zombie face-painting kit
and sets it next to the monkshood.
Cars are streaming down the street in both directions.
Groups of COSTUMED TEENAGE BOYS flock down the walks, over
lawns, and que up to get into the Fitzgerald party.
On their front porch, Pamela and Henry meet and greet the
young men, awed by their numbers.
HENRY
(to Pamela)
Notice any girls?
Pamela shrugs.
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15. 1996 95
One BOY in a skeleton costume creeps along the shrubs toward
the Fitzgerald sisters' bedroom window. He stumbles over a
demon, a Frankenstein and a mummy. They curse one another.
The truck speeds down the street a tad erratical ly. Sirens
rise around it.
The truck rolls to the crest of the hill over Bailey Downs -
the sight of the bush party. The moon is immense up here.
You could almost touch it.
Brigitte climbs out of the cab. She moves to the back doors
of the truck, and opens them. In the inky darkness inside,
she hears heavy panting.
BRIGITTE
Ginger? C'mon, we got move.
Shove Sam down here.
Brigitte climbs up into the truck, reaching for something on
its floor. Brigitte f itids Sam's prone feet.
An animal/Ginger launches out at her, knocking her back, out,
clear of the truck. Ginger isn't Ginger any more - what we
can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a creature much
like the one that bit Ginger. And it's attacking Brigitte.
Brigitte flails, kicks and punches at it. She breaks free
and clambers at the tool rack on the inside panel of the
truck. She grabs a shovel as the creature comes snarling up
at her.
BRIGITTE
Stop. I mean it.
It lunges at her again and Brigitte clocks it. It slides,
dazed, off the back of the truck to the ground.
JUMP TO:
Brigitte drags Sam's body into the front seat. She sets her
Adidas bag on the gas pedal. She releases the brake.
The truck rolls forward. off the top of the hill. Brigitte
watches as it crashes down, down, rolling and twisting into
the suburb below. It lands in a heap and bursts into flames.
107
BRIGITTE
Nice one.
Brigitte returns to where It/Ginger was last seen on the
ground. The shovel and blanket are there. A bloody pool
trails off into the woods. Brigitte hefts the shovel warily,
shoulders the blanket, and follows the wetness shining in the
moonlight.
The sunrise has the sky this bloody red.
108
Brigitte drags Ginger a few feet past a sign next to the
road: THANK YOU FOR VISITING BAILEY DOWNS!
BRIGITTE (V/O)
We made it out. There was this
road? An' the space between
here and where ever. I did it.
Brigitte opens the blanket. Ginger has returned to human
form. Because Ginger is dead.
In a small grove of trees, Brigitte pushes the last pile of
dirt over Ginger's shallow grave.
Brigitte wipes her caked hands off in the dewy grass. Beneath
the dirt and dried blood, she finds puncture wounds. BITES.
Brigitte looks TO CAMERA. She rolls her eyes wearily.
Brigitte stands and heads to the side of the road. A semi
appears on the horizon, coming her way. Brigitte lifts her
thumb.
The semi's turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers to
arrive before her.
ROLL TAIL CREDITS as:
Excerpts from an episode of the television program UNSOLVED
MYSTERIES roll. It tells the story of the mysterious
disappearance of two teenage girls - sisters - who
disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally quiet
suburb of Bailey Downs.
Brigitte and Ginger LOOK-A-LIKES re-enact the summarized
events of their flight from justice. The cops figured out
their faked deaths, of course.. Henry and Pamela have
reportedly denied comment. It is seen from the community's
perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wrong,
a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness. No one
can explain though the non-human blood trails leaving the
scene of their last crime...
At the segment's close and the credits roll. out, we see the
traditional high school photos of Brigitte and Ginger.
1 09
VOICE OF UNSOLVED MYSTERIES
