      INT. MANHATTAN HIGH RISE APARTMENT - DAY

      A beautiful view of Manhattan. We reverse to find we are in 
      the POV of a... 

      CAT who s perched on the ledge of a PATIO some 25 stories 
      above the city. This is GIGGLES. Giggles is DEEP IN THOUGHT. 

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Giggles, sweetie, where are you?! 

      Giggles looks inside the apartment where he sees his LONELY 
      OWNER (30s), on her couch, glancing around for her cat. 

                                  LONELY OWNER
                    Giggles, the Wendy Williams Show is 
                    starting, where are you?! 

      Giggles looks DOWN at the steep drop to the pavement below, 
      his face betraying an EXISTENTIAL CRISIS... Giggles looks 
      back at his Lonely Owner who s just spotted him outside.

                                  LONELY OWNER (CONT D)
                    Giggles, hurry! Wendy s on. She s 
                      interviewing Al Roker today.

      Giggles looks at his Lonely Owner for a beat. Then he JUMPS.

                                  LONELY OWNER (CONT D)
                    GIGGLES, NO!!!

      SMASH CUT:

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - LATER

      Through the glass of  EMERGENCY ROOM  DOORS we see Giggles on 
      a GURNEY, he looks like he s okay. The doors open to reveal: 
      DR. GEORGE COLEMAN (30s) a debonair veterinarian and NURSE 
      JUANITA (40s) - think Selma Hayak s cousin. 

                                    JUANITA
                    Owner s names are Trudy and Roger 
                    Watts, their cat, Giggles, has been 
                    a patient for a year...  

      George looks in the CONSULTATION ROOM where Trudy (the Lonely 
      Owner) fights tears. George sizes up her DOWDY DEMEANOR.

                                  GEORGE
                    No wedding ring. Bathrobe from 
                    Target. I m guessing Roger is no 
                    longer in the picture...                                                                                      2.


      INT. CONSULTATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      George enters alone and smiles at Trudy.

                                  GEORGE
                    Good news, Ms. Watts, Giggles 
                    suffered a few bruises but your cat 
                    is going to be just fine.

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    It must be a miracle...

                                  GEORGE
                    It s actually just nature. 
                      Specifically, a phenomenon called 
                       High-Rise Syndrome . See, cats 
                    that fall greater than 2 stories 
                    twist their bodies into what s 
                    referred to as a  righting reflex. 

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    That s amazing...

                                  GEORGE
                    Does Giggles spend a lot of time on 
                    the balcony, Ms. Watts?

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    Yes, often I have to drag him back 
                    inside, just to hang out with me. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Ms. Watts, have you considered that 
                    maybe what Giggles did was a cry 
                    for help?

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    Are you saying Giggles jumped? That 
                    my cat tried to... Kill himself?

                                  GEORGE
                    Your cat jumped, because he was 
                    trying to tell you something.

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    Like what? Giggles is a very happy 
                    cat. I take great care of him!

                                  GEORGE
                    Yes, but sometimes a cat needs more 
                    out of life. Like adventure. 
                    Sometimes a cat needs to go out at 
                    night, throw caution to the wind, 
                    let out its wild side.                                                                                      3.


                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    What if the cat doesn t have a wild 
                    side? What if it s an indoor cat?

                                  GEORGE
                    All cats have wild sides. They all 
                    want to claw and scratch and bite 
                    and make some bad decisions. 

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    Maybe the cat s scared. Maybe the 
                    cat s been hurt.

                                  GEORGE
                    All the more reason why the cat 
                    needs to get out and meet someone.

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    And then that very someone leaves 
                    the cat for the cat s best friend. 
                    On the cat s birthday. Via text! 

                                  GEORGE
                    Then the cat needs to go out again 
                    and again, until the cat gets it 
                    right. 

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    How s the cat supposed to know when 
                    it s right?

                                  GEORGE
                    Because the cat will feel it. The 
                    cat s legs will be shaking with 
                    such pleasure that the earth will 
                    move from below and every part of 
                    the cat will be blanketed with 
                    nothing but physical contentment. 

                                  TRUDY WATTS
                    Oh, my...

      Trudy straightens her posture confidently, revealing her 
      potential beauty and sex appeal.

                                  TRUDY WATTS (CONT D)
                    What did you say your name was?

                                  GEORGE
                    My name is Dr. George Coleman. And 
                    I get off at six. 

                                  END COLD OPEN                                                                                      4.


                                  ACT ONE

      EXT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - DAY

      GEORGE and a group of VETS, NURSES and HANDLERS are all 
      HUDDLED around a TELEVISION watching a HORSE RACE.

                                  GEORGE
                    Come on, Lucky Seven, come on!

      LARS, a rotund, neer-do-well handler is frustrated. 

                                  LARS
                    He s in last place. You re supposed 
                    to be a great Vet, you just lost me 
                    a hundred bucks. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Race isn t over... Look at that 
                    sheen, look at that gallop, I m 
                    telling you, Lucky Seven is just 
                    warming up. 

      DR. KIM, a skittish vet, sweats bullets. 

                                  DR. KIM
                    Are you sure you know what you re 
                    doing, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    How do you think I paid my way 
                    through Veterinary School? 

                                    JAUNITA (O.S.)
                    Has anyone seen Dr. Coleman?!

      George looks over, though the window, he spots Juanita 
      searching for him in the hall. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Dr. Kim, get the blinds.

      Dr. Kim lowers the blinds to the window hiding them. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Dr. Zaius, get the door!

      DR. ZAIUS, who happens TO BE A CHIMPANZEE, wearing a LAB COAT 
      and a TINTED VISOR, throws his full weight against the door. 

                                  LARS
                    Holy cow! Lucky Seven is coming up 
                    the rear! Look at that horse move!                                                                                      5.


      The guys are getting more and more excited. Sure enough Lucky 
      Seven wins the race. Everyone CHEERS. Dr. Zaius cheers the 
      loudest, throwing his VISOR in the air. The door SLAMS OPEN. 

                                    JUANITA
                    Okay, everyone back to work. This 
                    is an Animal Hospital, not an OTB. 

      Everyone, shamefaced, exits under Juanita s glare. 

                                    JUANITA (CONT D)
                    And you, Dr. Coleman, are supposed 
                    to be in charge around here. 

      Juanita exits. George turns to Dr. Zaius. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Way to keep an eye on that door, 
                    Dr. Zaius. You just lost your ipad 
                      privileges. 

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

      George tries to catch up to Juanita. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Tell you what, Juanita, why don t I 
                    give you some of my winnings and 
                    we ll call it even. 

                                    JUANITA
                    What I want is for you to make a 
                    dent in that waiting room. We re 
                    backed up. Oh, and there s a woman 
                    out there who wants to see you. 

                                  GEORGE
                    A woman? 

      A HIPSTER, eating FUNYUNS and walking his DOG, steps up. 

                                    HIPSTER
                    Doc, you gotta help me. There s 
                    something wrong with my 
                      girlfriend s dog. She went out of 
                    town and left her with me, now 
                    she s been sluggish and tired and 
                    acting all weird. 

      George survey s the situation.

                                  GEORGE
                    There s nothing wrong with the dog. 
                    The dog is just fine.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      6.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                          (to Juanita)
                    What woman?

                                    JAUNITA
                    Never saw her before, but she s 
                    your type. Tall, blonde, full of 
                      self-loathing. She asked 
                      specifically for you. 

                                    HIPSTER
                    Doc, I m telling you. The dog s not 
                    the same since my girlfriend left.

                                  GEORGE
                    Your girlfriend doesn t like it 
                    that you smoke pot, does she?

                                    HIPSTER
                    What--? I don t smoke pot, man--

                                  GEORGE
                    Your eyes are red, you smell like a 
                    skunk and you re eating Funyuns.

                                    HIPSTER
                    What does this have to do with the 
                    dog?

                                  GEORGE
                    Because, you think that it s 
                    hilarious to blow pot smoke in the 
                    dog s face. You re getting the dog 
                    high and that s why it s sluggish. 
                    So quit it. 

                                    JUANITA
                    Or at least, get some better weed. 

                                  GEORGE
                          (to Juanita)
                    Where is she? 

      Juanita POINTS TOWARDS THE FRONT WAITING ROOM. 

                                    JUANITA
                    She s been waiting for a half hour. 

      George SPOTS a WOMAN with her back to him. George only sees 
      the back of her, but what he sees, he likes.  

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY

      George exits the examining room and is immediately THRONGED 
      by OWNERS, George side steps and heads for the woman.                                                                                       7.


                                  GEORGE
                    People, I ll be with you all in a 
                    second, I believe this young woman 
                    has been here for a while--

      The woman turns REVEALING, DOROTHY RUTLEDGE. She has an easy 
      and disarming beauty, yet her eyes speak of a sharp 
      intelligence. George stops in his tracks. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Hello, George, it s nice to see you 
                    again. Do you have a minute? 

      George is stunned into silence. 

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - GEORGE S OFFICE - DAY

      George enters followed by Dorothy. His office is filled with 
      PICTURES of George and FAMOUS ANIMALS: The President s dog, 
      Slash s snake, the Chihuahua from the Taco Bell commercials. 
      George s GOLDEN RETRIEVER named DWAYNE, sleeps in the corner. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You re going to have to make it 
                    quick, Dorothy, I m backed up out 
                    there--

      Dwayne wakes, spots Dorothy, gets excited and rushes to her, 
      barking and licking her face. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Hello, Dwyane, good boy, did you 
                    miss me? Did you miss me? 

                                  GEORGE
                    Okay, Dwayne, that s enough...

      George drags Dwayne out of his office by the collar. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                          (to Dwayne)
                    Thanks a lot, Judas.

      George shuts the door and turns back to Dorothy. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    I heard you saved the Mayor s dog. 

                                  GEORGE
                    From fleas. I prescribed him 
                    shampoo. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Well, it made the papers.                                                                                       8.


                                  GEORGE
                    Two years ago I leave to go pick us 
                    up some Thai food, when I got back 
                    you were gone. No phone call, no 
                    email, no text, no explanation and 
                    now two years later you ve come 
                    back to congratulate me on helping 
                    the Mayor s dog? Thank you.  

                                    DOROTHY
                    Do you remember what I said to you, 
                    George, before you went to pick up 
                    that Thai food. 

                                  GEORGE
                    It was two years ago. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    I said I loved you and do you 
                    remember what you said in return? 

                                  GEORGE
                    Two years, Dorothy. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    You said,  Awesome.  I say,  I love 
                    you.  You say,  Awesome. 

                                  GEORGE
                    What did you want me to say?

                                    DOROTHY
                    Gee, George, how about,  I love you 
                    too, Dorothy. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You know, people throw that word 
                    around a lot. People love 
                      spaghetti. They love their 
                      sweatpants. They love Sunday night 
                      television. I got a cousin who 
                    loooves the smell of his own feet-- 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Okay, George--

                                  GEORGE
                    I didn t say it because it would ve 
                    cheapened what I felt for you. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    And what did you feel for me?                                                                                      9.


                                  GEORGE
                    I was attracted to you. I m talking 
                    a strong animal magnetism. When I 
                    was near you, I wanted to rip off 
                    your clothes. 
                          (beat)
                    I still do. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    George, I m getting married. 

                                  GEORGE
                          (he takes this in)
                    So, you came here to tell me this? 
                    You could ve just sent me a save 
                    the date, Dorothy. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    No, I came here because as of 
                    tomorrow morning I ve been tapped 
                    to be the new Director of this 
                    Hospital. My father suggested it 
                    and the Board approved it 
                      unanimously.  

      George is PISSED.

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      George, livid, walks down the hall. Dorothy is close behind. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    The hospital is a mess. There have 
                    been complaints, George. Owners are 
                    not happy.  

                                  GEORGE
                    We treat animals. Who cares about 
                    the owners?!

                                    DOROTHY
                    I do. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You won t last. You don t have what 
                    it takes to run this hospital.

                                    DOROTHY
                    My father thinks differently. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You hate your father. It was your 
                    contempt for him that let me get 
                    you into bed so quickly.                                                                                     10.


                                    DOROTHY
                    I know that me being here is going 
                    to bump up against one of your 
                    animal philosophies about territory 
                    or domination, but, I need to know 
                    that you can work under me. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Of course I can, that happens to be 
                    my second favorite position. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    If you don t like it, leave. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Leave?

                                    DOROTHY
                    Sure. Start your own practice. I 
                    hear the rent in Queens is quite 
                      reasonable. 

                                  GEORGE
                    I m the best vet here. I saved the 
                    Mayor s dog. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    From fleas, remember? You 
                      prescribed shampoo. 

                                  GEORGE
                    I was being modest. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    You re incapable of modesty. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Look out there, Dorothy. There s a 
                    jammed waiting room with people 
                    coming to see me. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Exactly. It s jammed. This hospital 
                    needs to be organized, because 
                    right now, if you ll pardon the 
                      expression, it s a zoo. 

      As if on cue, Dr. Kim and Dr. Zaius walk by in the middle of  
      a JUGGLING CONTEST. 

                                    DOROTHY (CONT D)
                    Scratch that. It s a circus.                                                                                    11.


      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - X-RAY ROOM - DAY

      George stands with DR. DOUG JACKSON (30s), a big, doughy, 
      sweet natured Vet, as they inspect X-rays. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Of all the Animal Hospitals in this 
                    world why does she have to walk 
                    into this one?

                                  DOUG
                    Well, because her family owns it. 
                    Her great-grandmother founded it.

                                  GEORGE
                    Yeah, I know, Doug. It was a joke.

                                  DOUG
                    Can I confide in you, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    Of course, I m your best friend. 

                                  DOUG
                    Thanks, George, but you re not 
                    exactly my best friend. My best 
                    friend is Frankie Buchner, I ve 
                    known him since the second grade. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Fine, I m your best work friend.

                                  DOUG
                    Mmmm, no, actually Dr. Kim is my 
                    best work friend. We eat lunch 
                    every day together. I m godfather 
                    to his son.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, where exactly do I rank?

                                  DOUG
                    George, my girlfriend left me for 
                    another guy.

                                  GEORGE
                      Obviously. What did you expect, 
                    Doug? You don t exactly groom 
                    yourself. You re a big shaggy mess. 

                                  DOUG
                    This is why you rank really low in 
                    the friend department, George.                                                                                    12.


                                  GEORGE
                    All I m saying is, it s only 
                    natural for a peacock to search for 
                    brighter tail feathers. 

                                  DOUG
                    This is not about tail feathers! 
                    This is my life! I thought she was 
                    the one. We were talking marriage.

                                  GEORGE
                    Marriage is unnatural. Of all the 
                    species on this planet only twenty 
                    mate for life. You know who mates 
                    for life? Termites. Are you a 
                    termite, Doug?

                                  DOUG
                    That depends. Do termites still 
                    love their girlfriends even after 
                    they find out that they re banging 
                    some other guy?  

      George feels bad for him.

                                  GEORGE
                    Establish dominance. 

                                  DOUG
                    Establish what?

                                  GEORGE
                    Establish dominance. What do you 
                    think Harvey would do?

      George points to an ANGRY PIT BULL, presumably Harvey, who 
      sits in a cage GROWLING DANGEROUSLY. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    You want your girlfriend back? Find 
                    the guy who s banging her and rip 
                    out his jugular.

      George grabs an X-Ray and leaves the room.

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY

      ALAN WAXMAN (40s) a big man eats a SANDWICH. He sits with his 
      daughter LILY (8) who cradles her dog, HONEY. George enters. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Mr. Waxman, Lily, good news, Honey 
                    is going to be okay.                                                                                    13.


                                  LILY
                    Really?! Thank you, Doctor Coleman!

                                  GEORGE
                    Honey s going to have to stay here 
                    for a few days, Lily, so give her a 
                    kiss goodbye. I need to speak with 
                    your dad for a sec.

                                  LILY
                    I love you, Honey, see you soon.

      George takes Honey. When Lily leaves, he turns to Waxman and 
      shows him the X-RAY with an OVAL SHAPE in Honey s STOMACH.

                                  GEORGE
                    Honey ate something, we re not sure 
                    what exactly, except that it s 
                      indigestible and must be removed.

                                  WAXMAN
                    Of course, that s all it does is 
                    eat my stuff. It ate my car keys, 
                    my watch, my cell phone. Do me a 
                    favor, put the dog to sleep.  

                                  GEORGE
                    Look, if it s about the money for 
                    surgery, we can always help--

                                  WAXMAN
                    I m a partner at Meyers and Meyers, 
                    trust me, money is of no object.
                    I hate that dog. It s got something 
                    against me. It only eats stuff that 
                    belongs to me. Put the slob down. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Mr. Waxman, often our pets take on 
                    the traits of their owners.

                                  WAXMAN
                          (mouth full of food)
                    Did you just compare me to a dog? 

                                  GEORGE
                    Look, don t punish a dog because he 
                    reminds you of your own issues.

                                  WAXMAN
                    Who the hell do you think you are? 

                                  GEORGE
                    Just think about it.                                                                                    14.


                                  WAXMAN
                    Hey, we re not finished, get back 
                    here!

      George quickly exits with Honey.

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      George exits, passing a PARROT.

                                  GEORGE
                    What a douche bag...

      Waxman follows George out into the hallway.

                                  WAXMAN
                    What did you call me?!

                                  PARROT
                    Squack! What a douche bag! Squack! 
                    What a douche bag!

                                  WAXMAN
                    Are you insane?! You do realize I m 
                    a partner at a law firm, right?! 

                                  GEORGE
                    Dr. Zaius, run some interference, 
                    run some interference!

      Dr. Zaius WAVES HIS ARMS WILDLY AND HOLLERS, blocking Waxman.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    I think you should take 24 hours to 
                      reconsider, Mr. Waxman!

      Dorothy RUSHES up to George. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    What was that all about?

                                  GEORGE
                    Nothing, everything is hunky-dory.

                                  PARROT
                    Squack! Everything is hunky-dory!

      Dorothy watches George slip past her. She SNEEZES. 

                                  END ACT ONE                                                                                    15.


                                  ACT TWO

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - MORNING

      George steps in and stops. Everything has changed. What was 
      once an unruly waiting room jammed packed with owners and 
      pets, now is a serene oasis, with just two people waiting. 

      George notices Liza Minelli wafting from the speakers. 

                                  GEORGE
                    What is that noise?

      HARRY, a FLAMBOYANT HIPPIE HANDLER, walks by. 

                                  HARRY
                    Isn t it great? Ms. Rutledge told 
                    the staff to rotate our favorite 
                    music so that the owners feel like 
                    they re getting to know the staff 
                    on a more human level.  

      ANGELA, the CLUELESS, YET HOT RECEPTIONIST perks up.

                                  ANGELA
                    Next up, anything by Michael Buble! 

      Juanita STEPS UP and HANDS George a CLIPBOARD. 

                                  GEORGE
                    What this? 

                                    JUANITA
                    That s your schedule. It includes 
                    today s patients, as well as who s 
                    on deck for tomorrow. It s all 
                      cross-referenced with their case 
                      histories, billing information-- 

                                  GEORGE
                    How d you do all this?

                                    JUANITA
                    I didn t. Dorothy Rutledge is  
                      streamlining the office. It s all 
                    done to help you stay on track.

                                  GEORGE
                    I ll decide how to stay on track. 
                    This is ridiculous. 
                          (He stands on a table)
                      Everybody! Please gather around 
                    now!                                                                                    16.


      Handlers, vets and nurses stop what they re doing and listen.

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    I don t want to alarm anybody, but 
                    there is a wolf in our midst. A 
                    wolf in sheep s clothing. Sure, she 
                    may be pleasant and harmless 
                    looking, and maybe she does smell 
                    really, really good, but don t be 
                    fooled. This woman will be the ruin 
                    of us and we all know who I m 
                    talking about. The new Director, 
                    Dorothy Rutledge. We have to band 
                    together folks, stand up to this 
                    tyrant in a skirt...

      George notices that some of the people in the back are 
      distracted and have started to wander off...

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    This is serious. She s going to 
                    take away the very essence of our 
                    nature...

      More and more people are leaving George and heading off...

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Where s everyone going?!

      George follows them out. 

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA - MORNING

      Everyone crowds into the CAFETERIA to find Dorothy taking 
      freshly baked cookies out of the oven. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Hello, everyone, help yourselves. I 
                    just wanted to introduce myself. 
                    I m Dorothy Rutledge and I m the 
                    new Director. I so look forward to 
                    getting to know everyone and please 
                    be aware that my door is always, 
                    always open...

                                  LARS
                    These cookies are the bomb. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    It s a family recipe. 

      George watches as everyone indulges in the cookies, annoyed.                                                                                     17.


                                    DOROTHY (CONT D)
                    Ah, George! Just the person I was 
                    looking for. Walk with me.

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      George follows Dorothy down the hall. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Nice touch with the cookies. 
                    Treat animals like people and 
                    people like animals.

                                    DOROTHY
                    I was just treating people like 
                    people. Did you insult an owner and 
                    then refuse to put his dog to 
                    sleep? 

                                  GEORGE
                    Yeah, so?

                                    DOROTHY
                    He wants an apology. 

      She SNEEZES. George hands her a Kleenex. 

                                    DOROTHY (CONT D)
                    This is just perfect. My first week 
                    on the job and I get sick. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You shouldn t be here if you re 
                    sick. You could infect the animals. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Wait...? Really? Is that true?

                                  GEORGE
                    No. I just said that as a way of 
                      illustrating how woefully 
                      unqualified you are for this job. 
                    Can I show you something? 

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - CAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      CLOSE ON: Honey. The terrier is lying on its back looking 
      cute as can be. Dorothy s heart melts a bit despite herself. 

                                  GEORGE
                    This is Honey. Honey is a terrier, 
                    one of the truly noble breeds of 
                    canines. Her ancestors used to hunt 
                    side by side with Kings. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    18.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Now this jerk wants to put her down 
                    because it s easier than going on a 
                    diet. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    It s what the owner wants. You re 
                    going to have to do it. 

                                  GEORGE
                    No, you are. 

      George takes out a SHEET OF PAPER and hands it to her. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    I can t perform that operation 
                    without the approval of the 
                    Director. I m going to need you to 
                    sign Honey s death warrant. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    You re kidding...

      She looks at the sheet of paper. Then back at Honey. 

                                    DOROTHY (CONT D)
                    Maybe there s a way to save this 
                    dog. Instead of insulting the 
                    owner, you could have tried 
                    reasoning with him. 

                                  GEORGE
                    People like to think they reason, 
                    but all they really do is respond 
                    to force and humiliation. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    I m going to prove you wrong. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You give people too much credit. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    And you don t give them enough. 

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - O.R. - LATER

      George steps in and spots Doug giving himself stitches. 

                                  GEORGE
                    What happened to you?

                                  DOUG
                    I did what you said. I tried to 
                    establish dominance. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    19.

                                  DOUG (CONT'D)
                    But, it turns out that dominance 
                    was established on me. 

      George takes over the stitching. 

                                  DOUG (CONT D)
                    George, what should I do?

                                  GEORGE
                    If you can t establish dominance 
                    then you have to spread your seed. 

                                  DOUG
                    Spread my seed?  

                                  GEORGE
                    You need to get laid. Preferably to 
                    a woman who resembles your ex. 

                                  DOUG
                    What are you doing tonight?

                                  GEORGE
                    I m doing what I always do on 
                    Friday night. I have a steak 
                    dinner, then I hit a downtown club. 

                                  DOUG
                    I never thought of you as a guy who 
                    goes clubbing. 

                                  GEORGE
                    If you want to bag a gazelle you 
                    have to go to the local watering 
                    hole. 

      Dr. Kim enters excited and points to SPEAKERS.

      Rebecca Black s Friday begins to play.

                                  GEORGE
                    Friday. Yes. We get it. 

      Dr. Kim exits, pleased.                                                                                     20.


                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    This place is turning into my own 
                    personal hell. 

                                  DOUG
                    Take me with you to the club. Let 
                    me be your wingman. 

                                  GEORGE
                    I m more of a lone wolf, Doug. 
                    Sorry. 

                                  DOUG
                    Please. You know what I do after 
                    work? I go across the street to 
                    O Mally s where I listen to drunks 
                    talk to me about their gall 
                    bladder. 

      George looks out in the hallway and spots Dorothy talking 
      with Dr. Kim. Angela walks up to her. 

                                  ANGELA
                    Ms. Rutledge, your fiance is on the 
                    phone, he wants to know if dinner 
                    is still at eight. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Tell him to push it back an hour, 
                    I m going to be here late. 

      At the mention of this, George PULLS a little TOO hard on the 
      stitch causing Doug to YELP in pain. 

                                  DOUG
                    George, watch it!

                                  GEORGE
                    You know what, Doug? You re right. 
                    We should go out tonight. Let s get 
                    a little wild. 

      EXT./INT. CLUB LIT - NIGHT

      The club is in full swing as George and Doug enter. Doug, 
      clearly excited, bobs his head to the music. George glares at 
      him and Doug stops. Doug takes out NOTE CARDS. 

                                  DOUG
                    Okay, so I Googled some pick up 
                    lines. Which ones do you like? Was 
                    that an earthquake or did you just 
                    rock my world?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    21.

                                  DOUG (CONT'D)
                    Oh, this one s really good: Are you 
                    Jamaican? Cuz Jamaican me crazy--

      George snatches the note cards away.

                                  GEORGE
                    Take a look at the bar and zero in 
                    on women who are playing with their 
                    hair. It signifies that they are 
                    sexually frustrated, or that they 
                    just did a ton of cocaine in the 
                    bathroom, either way, they ll be 
                      susceptible to being picked up. 

      Doug POINTS TO TWO HOT GIRLS PLAYING WITH THEIR HAIR. 

                                  DOUG
                    Those girls are totally on coke. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Good eye. Now follow my lead. 

      George and Doug walk up to the hot girls. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Ladies, what are you drinking?

                                  HOT GIRL # 1
                    Dark and Stormy s. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Sounds great. 
                          (to bartender)
                    Two Dark and Stormy s for these two 
                    beautiful women. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 2
                    Are you guys not drinking?

                                  GEORGE
                    We would, but we re on call right 
                    now. I may have to operate later 
                    tonight.

                                  HOT GIRL # 1
                    So, you guys are doctors?

                                  GEORGE
                    We re doctors for animals.  

                                  HOT GIRL # 2
                    Awwwww, I love animals.                                                                                     22.


                                  GEORGE
                    Well, then let me show you a 
                    picture of my latest patient...

      George takes out his IPHONE and SHOWS THEM A PICTURE OF THE 
      CUTEST PUPPY EVER. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 1
                    Oh, my God! He s sooooo cute. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 2
                    I can t even stand it. He s 
                    adorable! 

                                  DOUG
                    Here s who I m working on.

      Doug takes out his IPHONE and shows them a PICTURE. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 1 
                    Ewwwwww!

                                  HOT GIRL # 2
                    Gross! What is that?!

                                  DOUG
                    I was lancing a boil on an old cat. 
                    The green stuff is puss, the rest 
                    is just blood and mucus. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 1
                    That s disgusting. I m gonna be 
                    sick. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 2
                    Let me take you to the bathroom.

      The two Hot Girls walk away. 

                                  GEORGE
                    What is your problem?!

                                  DOUG
                    You told me to follow your lead! 

                                  GEORGE
                    Women like to see pictures of 
                    puppies and kittens and bunnies, 
                    because it taps into their maternal 
                    instinct and arouses in them a 
                    desire to procreate. Do you know 
                    how we procreate, Doug?                                                                                    23.


                                  DOUG
                    By having sex? 

                                  GEORGE
                    By having sex. Exactly. Puppies are 
                    Mother Nature s aphrodisiac. 

                                  DOUG
                    I m sorry. I should go. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You re just going to give up?

                                  DOUG
                    Who am I kidding, George? Nobody 
                    wants to be with me. It s just 
                    natural selection, I guess...

      George watches as Doug glumly retreats out of the club. 

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - DOROTHY S OFFICE - DAY

      Dorothy tries to reason with Mr. Waxman. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    ... the thing to know about Honey 
                    is she s a Terrier, and Terrier s 
                    are a noble breed. Her ancestors 
                    once hunted along side Kings--

                                  WAXMAN
                    That s all great, but I can t stand 
                    it. I hate this dog. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Okay. We won t charge you for the 
                    surgery. You wouldn t put your 
                      daughter s dog to sleep, when we re 
                    willing to forgo the fee. I m sure 
                    you can be reasonable about this.  

      Waxman thinks as Dorothy s smile and charm sets in.

                                  WAXMAN
                    Fine, I guess... 

                                    DOROTHY
                    That s wonderful, Mr. Waxman!

                                  WAXMAN
                    ... Under one condition. I want 
                    some respect. If that Dr. Coleman 
                    character apologizes, I ll okay the 
                      operation.                                                                                      24.


                                    DOROTHY
                    I m sure... That won t be a problem 
                    at all.

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

      George walks in to spot Dr. Kim wrestling with a PYTHON. 

                                  DR. KIM
                    Oh, good, George, a little help--

                                  GEORGE
                    Yup, in a second...

      George takes out his IPHONE and starts FILMING.

                                  DR. KIM
                      George...?

                                  GEORGE
                    Just a second. I m gonna upload 
                    this to youtube. Can you imagine 
                    the hits we ll get? 

      Dorothy walks in. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    What s going on here? You know 
                    what? I don t want to know. George, 
                    a word?

                                  GEORGE
                    Yeah, okay, I got a minute. 

                                  DR. KIM 
                    George?!

      Dr. Kim goes down. 

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER

      George walks the hallway with Dorothy.

                                    DOROTHY
                    He was totally reasonable. All he 
                    asks is that you apologize. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Great. Except I m not going to 
                    apologize to that miscreant. He 
                    started it.                                                                                     25.


                                    DOROTHY
                    He started it? You ve got a PHD in 
                      veterinary science and you re 
                    resorting to the sixth grade? 
                    What s next? Your mother jokes? 

                                  GEORGE
                    What are you so upset about? 

                                    DOROTHY
                    That dog is going to be put to 
                    sleep because you won t swallow 
                    your pride and apologize. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Animals get put to sleep, Dorothy, 
                    it s part of what we do. I don t 
                    think you can handle it and I don t 
                    think this is the job for you. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    This has nothing to do with the 
                    job. This has to do with the fact 
                    that you can t stand working under 
                    me. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Of course I can, that happens to be 
                    my-- 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Second favorite position. Yeah. So, 
                    now we re back in the 6th grade. It 
                    must be exhausting to be so glib. I 
                    don t know how you do it. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Practice. 

      She takes out a piece of paper and SIGNS it. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Here s the approval to put the dog 
                    to sleep. Congratulations. You made 
                    your point.

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - DOROTHY S OFFICE - DAY

      Dorothy is at her desk when Angela steps in. 

                                  ANGELA
                    Ms. Rutledge, your dad s here and 
                    also, he s with a really cute guy. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    That s my fiance Spencer. 

                                  ANGELA
                    Oh, so it s serious? 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Pretty serious, yes, Angela.

                                  ANGELA
                    Oh, well, will you let me know if 
                    it doesn t work out?

                                    DOROTHY
                    You ll be the first person I call. 

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY

      Dorothy enters and spots SPENCER, attractive and patronizing, 
      along with BERTRAND RUTLEDGE, an old money, antiquated snob. 

                                    SPENCER
                    There she is. Your father and I 
                    thought we d surprise you. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Well, isn t this nice? Let me give 
                    you guys a tour. 

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

      Dorothy leads them through the hospital.

                                    DOROTHY
                    All our examining rooms are to our 
                    right, and our OR is right up here. 

                                    SPENCER
                    Wow, this is just like a real 
                    hospital. I should work here 
                    because some of my patients are 
                    total animals.                                                                                    27.


      They pass George s office, where they spot him PLAYING CARDS 
      with DR. ZAIUS.

                                    SPENCER (CONT D)
                    Is that man playing cards with a 
                      chimpanzee?

      George SLAPS his cards angrily on the table.

                                  GEORGE
                    Dammit, Dr. Zaius! You re cheating!

                                    SPENCER
                    And he seems to be losing. 

                                  BERTRAND
                    How is George Coleman, still hard 
                    at work at not living up to his 
                      potential?

                                    DOROTHY
                    He s fine, dad. 

                                  BERTRAND
                    George threw away a promising 
                    career in medicine. He was at 
                    Harvard Medical before he quit so 
                    that he could spend his days taking 
                    the temperature of cats. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    He just realized he was always more 
                      interested in animals than people. 
                    For your information, there are 
                    only twenty eight veterinary 
                    colleges in the country? It s more 
                      competitive than medical school--

                                  BERTRAND
                    We re not here to discuss George 
                    Coleman. 

                                    SPENCER
                    Dorothy, this is an intervention. 

                                  BERTRAND
                    You ve been engaged for six months 
                    and you refuse to set a date.

                                    DOROTHY
                    I don t refuse. You put me in 
                    charge of this hospital and--                                                                                    28.


                                  BERTRAND
                    Animal hospital. It s an Animal 
                    Hospital. How much work could it 
                    be? Dorothy, I put you in charge of 
                    this place so you could have ample 
                    time to plan your wedding. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    And here I was thinking that it was 
                      a stepping stone to something 
                    bigger. 

                                    SPENCER
                    What dad is saying--

                                    DOROTHY
                    He s not your dad, yet, Spencer. 

                                  BERTRAND
                      Sweetheart, if you want to work, do 
                    what the other women in our family 
                    do. Philanthropy. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    I have an MBA from Wharton, I have 
                    eight years experience working for 
                    two sperate fortune five hundred 
                      companies, I ve been awarded 
                    numerous citations by Manhattans  
                    Chamber of Commerce and in my 
                    entire career I have never taken a 
                    personal day. You promised if I 
                    turned this place around it would 
                    lead to something bigger and 
                    better. So, I need to know, dad, 
                    are you a man of your word? 

                                  BERTRAND 
                      Begrudgingly. 

                                    SPENCER
                    Dorothy, let s finish the tour. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    The tour s over. 

      Dorothy leaves. 

      INT. ANIMAL HOSPITAL - DOROTHY S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Dorothy is working at her desk when she decides to call it a 
      night. She collects her stuff.                                                                                    29.


      WAITING ROOM

      Dorothy is on her way out, when she spots Juanita. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Go home, Juanita, it s late. 

                                    JUANITA
                    I m just staying until Dr. Coleman 
                    finishes up. In case he needs me. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Finishes up? 

                                    JUANITA
                    He s taking care of the Waxman dog. 

      Dorothy s face goes white. 

      OPERATING ROOM 

      Dorothy rushes into the room but it s too late. Honey is on 
      the operating table not moving.  

                                    DOROTHY
                    Oh, no... 

      George steps in the room, surprised to see her. 

                                    DOROTHY (CONT D)
                    You actually did it... You put her 
                    to sleep...
                          (getting emotional)
                    I always understood that you were 
                      narcissistic and egotistical and 
                    full of pride, but I never thought 
                    it would get in the way of your 
                    respect for animals. All you had to 
                    do was apologize and this dog would 
                    still be alive.

      Dorothy is upset as she tries to hold back tears, when... 
      WOOF! Dorothy JUMPS, startled, as she spots HONEY RISING. 
      Dorothy let s out a small SCREAM. 

                                    DOROTHY (CONT D)
                    You didn t put her down?

                                  GEORGE
                    Of course not. I removed what she 
                    had ingested. I wasn t going to put 
                    an animal that could be saved to 
                    sleep. That s something only a 
                    human would do.                                                                                      30.


                                    DOROTHY
                    Why do you have such little respect 
                    for people, George? All the time we 
                    were together it s the one thing I 
                    always wanted to ask you. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Why didn t you?

                                    DOROTHY
                    I was afraid of the answer. 

                                  GEORGE
                    When I was eight, my mother left 
                    our family for a vacuum salesman. I 
                    never saw her again. You d never 
                    see a wolf leave her cub for a 
                    vacuum salesman. 

      Dorothy takes this in. She nods at the dog.

                                    DOROTHY
                    What about her owner? You operated 
                    without his permission. You have to 
                      apologize.

                                  GEORGE
                    Yeah, if I don t the hospital is 
                    liable and he could sue the pants 
                    off us. We d both lose our jobs. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    So, you re going to apologize. 

                                  GEORGE
                    I ll do the right thing. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Thank you, George. 

      George leaves. Dorothy thinks about it. 

                                    DOROTHY (CONT D)
                    Wait! What does that mean?!

      She rushes after him, but George is gone. 

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - EXAMINING ROOM - MORNING

      George examines a TABBY CAT, when Doug dances in whistling, 
      he takes a quick look at the cat.                                                                                     31.


                                  DOUG
                    Judging by the lesions, I m 
                    guessing Cat Scratch Fever. Would 
                    you concur? 

                                  GEORGE
                    I would concur. 

                                  DOUG
                    And here s another one for you. 
                    Symptoms, the patient has a spring 
                    in his step, his mood is brightened 
                    and oh yes, he is wearing the same 
                    clothes that he did yesterday 
                      signifying that he did not sleep in 
                    his apartment last night.  
                      Diagnosis?

                                  GEORGE
                    I would diagnose the patient as 
                    having spread his seed the pervious 
                    evening. Would you concur?

                                  DOUG
                    You bet your ass I concur. It was 
                    amazing. After work I go to 
                    O Mally s for yet another 
                      depressing drink and in walks this 
                    woman. And she is gorgeous. We 
                    start talking and one thing leads 
                    to another and the next thing I 
                    know I m doing the walk of shame 
                    this morning! 

                                  GEORGE
                      Congratulations, Doug. So, tell me, 
                    is it true what they say about 
                    redheads?

                                  DOUG
                    I m a gentleman, George, I don t 
                    kiss and tell. But yes, gingers are 
                    freaking crazy. 

      Doug exits the room. After a beat he comes right back in. 

                                  DOUG (CONT D)
                    How did you know she was a redhead?

      George has no answer. 

                                  DOUG (CONT D)
                    Oh no. Oh my God. She was a hooker 
                    wasn t she?! You got me a hooker?!                                                                                    32.


                                  GEORGE
                    No. The man your ex-girlfriend is 
                    sleeping with has an ex-girlfriend 
                    himself. Last night you slept with 
                    her. 

                                  DOUG
                    Really? You made that happen?

                                  GEORGE
                    I called her up, told her who you 
                    were and let nature take it s 
                    course. As any Siberian Tiger will 
                      illustrate, revenge is a sub-human 
                    instinct. Siberian Tiger s will 
                    spend weeks hunting and killing 
                    anything that has harmed them. 
                    Revenge generates a neuro-chemical 
                    reaction that s far more satisfying 
                    than reconciliation. Human s call 
                    this an  anger bang -- 

                                  DOUG
                    Yes, I know what they called it. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Or a grudge fu--

                                  DOUG
                    Yes, thank you. You know, you may 
                    actually be my best work friend.

                                  GEORGE
                    I told you so.

      They share a moment.

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY

      Dorothy confers with Mr. Waxman and Lily. There is BARKING. 
      Lily spots Honey galloping towards her. 

                                  LILY
                    Honey! 

      Honey runs into her arms and Lily cradles her. George steps 
      up to them. Mr. Waxman is irate. 

                                  WAXMAN
                    I see you did the surgery without 
                    my permission. You were supposed to 
                    apologize first. I ll have my law 
                    firm take this place down.                                                                                     33.


                                    DOROTHY
                    That won t be necessary, Mr. 
                    Waxman. George was just about to 
                      apologize. Right, George? 

                                  GEORGE
                    Fine. I apologize. I apologize for 
                    giving Mr. Waxman too much credit. 

                                  WAXMAN
                    That is not an apology. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    George, that is not an apology.

                                  GEORGE
                    Oh, and by the way, the operation 
                    was six thousand dollars and you re 
                    going to pay every penny. 

                                  WAXMAN
                    That s it. I m suing! I m suing 
                    you! I m suing her! I m suing the 
                    monkey--!

      GEORGE whips out a DRINK COASTER that reads  DAZZLES .

                                  GEORGE
                    This is what I removed from Honey s 
                    stomach last night. It s a coaster 
                    from a places called, Dazzles. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Dazzles?

                                  GEORGE
                    Dazzles is a Gentleman s Club. 

                                    DOROTHY
                      Gentlemen's Club?

                                  GEORGE
                    A strip club, Dorothy. Mr. Waxman 
                    here has a rather expensive hobby. 

                                  WAXMAN
                          (clearly guilty)
                    I ve never, uh, I ve never seen 
                    that before in my life--                                                                                    34.


                                  GEORGE
                    Here s what going to happen. Your 
                    little girl is going to grow up 
                    fast and pretty soon she s going to 
                    realize that her father who she 
                    trusted and loved actually killed 
                    her dog because he ate a coaster 
                    from a strip club. And this 
                    knowledge is going to fill her with 
                    such anger towards you, that ten 
                    years from now while frequenting 
                    Dazzles, you re going to look up on 
                    stage and find that swinging from a 
                    pole is none other than your little 
                    girl. And you know what name she s 
                    going to go by?

                                  LILY (O.S.)
                    Honey!

      Mr. Waxman looks over at Lily hugging Honey with love. 

                                  GEORGE
                    That s right. Honey.

                                  FLOYD
                    Do you accept American Express? 

      Even Dorothy is impressed. 

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - DOROTHY S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Dorothy finishes up for the day, grabs her jacket and exits.  

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Dorothy heads out...

                                    DOROTHY
                    Good night, Angela. 

                                  ANGELA
                    Good night, Ms. Rutledge. 

      EXT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

      As Dorothy exits she spots a CAB pulling away, she chases it. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Taxi! Taxi!

      But, it s gone. She stands on the street searching for 
      another when George comes up behind her.                                                                                     35.


                                  GEORGE
                    You notice there s never a cab when 
                    you need one?

                                    DOROTHY
                    You did a good job today. You re a 
                    good vet, George. 

                                  GEORGE
                    I know. 

      She SNEEZES. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Damn, I just can t shake this cold. 

                                  GEORGE
                    That s because you don t have a 
                    cold. You re allergic to animals. 
                    You re suffering from allergies. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    I ve never had allergies before.

                                  GEORGE
                    People develop different allergies 
                    as they get older. Sometimes 
                    they ll have an allergic reaction 
                    to the very things they once 
                    couldn t live without. 

      A TAXI stops in front of them. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Get some over the counter allergy 
                      medication, you ll be fine

                                    DOROTHY
                    Thanks, George. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You re welcome. Good night. 

      George gets into the cab. Dorothy watches him leave, until...

                                    DOROTHY
                    I can t believe he just stole my 
                    cab!

                                  END ACT THREE                                                                                    36.


                                  TAG

      INT. RUTLEDGE ANIMAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

      Dorothy walks down the hall, passing Juanita...

                                    DOROTHY
                    Where is everybody?!

      Juanita just shrugs. Dorothy opens the door to...

      EXAMINNG ROOM

      Where she finds George, Doug, Dr. Kim, Lars, and Harry all 
      quietly conferring on a SERIES OF X-RAYS. She surprises them. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Oh, sorry, I didn t mean to 
                      interrupt. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You weren t interrupting, we re 
                    just inspecting a fractured femur 
                    of a St. Bernard that came in 
                      yesterday.  

                                    DOROTHY
                    Oh, well, I ll let you get back to 
                    it.  

      As soon as Dorothy leaves, Lars pulls back a curtain, 
        revealing...

      Dr. Zaius in his visor, clutching FISTFULS OF CASH. On the 
      ground near him, are FIVE TURTLES all being ridden by KITTENS 
      as they race to a FINISH LINE. 

                                  THE GROUP
                    Go! Go! Go!

      One TURTLE finishes first. The Room goes NUTS.
