               television. They are all laughing.

               The boys all laugh merrily, now surrounded by bags of cheesy 
               poofs.

                         Children, children, to honor this

                         a canned food drive. Does anybody 
                         know what a canned food drive is?

               Cartman raises his hand.

                         for one day. Let's get on with our 
                         lesson. Right Mr. Hat?

                         the moon, who was second?

               Suddenly, a group of turkeys burst into the classroom and 
               gobble loudly.

                         AGHAGAGAH!!!!!

               The turkeys peck and move wildly, causing all the kids to 
               jump up on their desks. Even Mr. Garrison gets up on his 
               desk.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         What the hell is going on?!

               The Turkeys quickly tear the room apart. Knocking over desks, 
               and tearing everything off the walls.

               Just as quickly as they came, the turkeys leave. Leaving the 
               classroom a disaster.

                                     GARRISON

               bursts into the office with his little monkey boy.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         Mayor! We've got a very big problem!!

                                     MAYOR
                         Ah... You're that insane genetic 
                         engineer from up on the hill, right?

                                     MAPHESTO
                         Yes, and I may have made a horrible 
                         mistake! I was trying to genetically 
                         engineer Turkeys for Thanksgiving...

                                     MAYOR
                              (Skeptical)
                         Uh-huhhhh....

                                     MEPHESTO
                         You know, to provide food for the 
                         needy.

                                     MAYOR
                              (Still skeptical)
                         Of course.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         Well, something went wrong, and the 
                         turkeys broke free, and the worst 
                         part is... They're REALLY pissed 
                         off!

                                     MAYOR
                              (Still Skeptical)
                         Nnnaturally...

               The Mayor turns to her assistants and does a 'crazy' signal 
               with her hand. The assistants laugh.

                                     MAYOR
                         Oh do go on.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         We have to stop them or they could 
                         destroy everything! Time is short!!

               The mayor again turns to her assistants, but this time pulls 
               out a koo-koo clock, and turns it on so the little bird comes 
               out -- 'Koo-koo'

               The assistants laugh.

                                     MAYOR
                         You were saying?

                                     MEPHESTO
                         They act just like normal turkeys, 
                         except they're evil.

                                     MAYOR
                         Oh, my...

               The mayor turns yet again to her assistants, this time, she 
               pulls a large mule out of nowhere. The mule goes 'heehorr' 
               and the assistants laugh.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         Somehow I don't think you're taking 
                         me seriously.

                                     MAYOR
                         Now why would you say that?


               The boys BURST in through Cartman's front door.

                                     BOYS

                         Gosh, I hope we don't starve.

               Phillip suddenly farts.

               Suddenly, there is a knock at the door! The boys all look at 
               each other with huge eyes.

               After a pause, they RUSH to the door.

                                     KYLE
                         THE DIGITAL SPORTS WATCH IS HERE!!!

               Cartman opens the door.

               The boys' faces all drop.

               Standing there, looking pitiful and hungry, is a little 
               Ethiopian child.

                         said we wanted to adopt a kid!

               The little kid speaks.

                         OW!


               The boys and their families are gathered around a HUGE table.

                                     STAN
                         This is a great way for you to 
                         experience America, Starvin' Marvin. 
                         This is what we call an 'All you can 
                         eat buffet'.

               Marvin looks around nervously.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, here you can eat all you want 
                         for only $6.99 That's why we all 
                         come here on Tuesday nights. Except 
                         for Kenny's family, 'cause to them 
                         $6.99 is two year's income.

               They all laugh merrily.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Why is YOUR family poor, Starvin' 
                         Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic 
                         too?

               Marvin just sits there. A waiter walks in and sets down a 
               large plate of shrimp.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You see, Starvin Marvin, these are 
                         what we call APPETIZERS.

                         This is what you eat before you eat... 
                         to make you more hungry.

               Marvin can't believe it.

               The waiter reappears with several plates of food.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oop! Food's here! That's it for the 
                         appetizers!

               Cartman grabs the plate of shrimp and tosses it into a trash 
               can. Marvin's eyes absolutely pop.

               The boys start to gorge themselves.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No Starvin' Marvin that's my pot 
                         pie!

                         time of year you're supposed to share.

                         peach cobbler? No you don't want all 
                         that. Why don't you share it with 
                         me... Let me just have some of that.


               Garrison stands before the class holding a box that reads 
               "Canned Food Drive."

                                     GARRISON
                         Children, children, I'm a little 
                         disappointed in your Thanksgiving 
                         spirit. Only a few cans have been 
                         donated to our canned food drive...

               Garrison pulls out a few cans.

                                     GARRISON
                         And can't we do a little better than --
                              (Reading the cans)
                         Creamed corn, creamed corn and creamed 
                         corn?

               The class stares blankly.

                                     GARRISON
                         Please bring in more diverse food 
                         children, or else Kenny's family is 
                         going to have a pretty 'corny' 
                         Thanksgiving.

               Garrison pauses, and then starts laughing wildly.

               The kids all just sit there, Kenny just stares, as Garrison 
               slaps his knee and laughs like he just told the best joke in 
               the world.

                                     GARRISON
                         Corny... Corny... Gravy... Corny 
                         Thanksgiving... Hoo!

               Finally, Garrison contains himself.

                         Anyway, children, I understand a few 
                         of you have brought in something 
                         special for show and tell...

               Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny raise their hands.

                                     BOYS
                              (ad lib)
                         Yeah, yeah... We did. We do! We do!

                                     GARRISON
                         All right, boys, show us what you've 
                         brought.

               The boys walk with Starvin' Marvin to the front of the class.

                                     KYLE
                         This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' 
                         Marvin.

               Marvin looks around nervously. He peeks into the box of canned 
               food.

                                     STAN
                         He can do really cool stuff with his 
                         voice. Show 'em, Starvin' Marvin.

               Marvin says nothing, but instead reaches into the box and 
               pulls out a can of cream corn.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No! Starvin' Marvin, that's KENNY's 
                         creamed corn!

               Cartman grabs the can and puts it back in the box

                                     CARTMAN
                         No Starvin' Marvin... That's a BAD 
                         starvin' Marvin!

                                     GARRISON
                         Boys, what the hell are you doing? 
                         This is horribly, horribly WRONG!! 
                         How did you get this child?

                                     STAN
                         He was accidentally delivered to us 
                         instead of a sports watch.

                                     GARRISON
                         The sports watch from the commercial?

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, that one.

                                     BEBE
                         I want a Starvin' Marvin!

                                     CLYDE
                         Me too!

                                     PIP
                         Yes I'll pay fifty dollars for one!

               All of a sudden, all the other children go crazy. AD LIBBING 
               'I want a Etheopian' etc.

                                     GARRISON
                         Boys, you're too young to take care 
                         of a child. I'm afraid I'm going to 
                         have to call the Red Cross and have 
                         him returned.

                         Aw! I TOLD you we shouldn't have 
                         brought him to school, dude!!


                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you 
                         can pick him up tonight. Bye now.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Now, boys I hope you've learned your 
                         lesson.

                                     STAN
                         No.

                         You can't care for this child!

                                     KYLE
                         But I thought we were supposed to 
                         care on Thanksgiving.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Yes, but you don't actually get 
                         involved with the child's lives. 
                         You're supposed to just send money. 
                         And once in a while they write you a 
                         letter.

                         You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a 
                         normal place like South Park.

                                     STAN
                         So why can't he live here now?

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Because he can't!

                                     KYLE
                         Because why?

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Because 8 year olds can't be parents.

                                     KYLE
                         Then you take care of him.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         I can't. I'm, ah, very busy. I send 
                         my $5 a month. See?

                                     STAN
                         This sucks. Starvin' Marvin is our 
                         friend.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh well, back to the poor country 
                         with you.

                                     KYLE
                         You better watch what you say Cartman. 
                         You might be poor and hungry some 
                         day.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh yeah, right.


               Inside his lab, Mephesto is looking through a microscope.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         I knew you were the only person who 
                         would listen to me, Chef.

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah, well let's get it over with. 
                         This place gives me the Bubujeebies.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         Look here, my microscope. Tell me 
                         what you see...

               Mephesto gestures towards his microscope. Chef puts his eye 
               on it.

                                     CHEF
                         Uhh... I see an extreme close up of 
                         Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         Oh, whoops.

               Mephesto quickly switches the plates under the microscope.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         NOW tell me what you see.

                                     CHEF
                         Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say 
                         it looks like Turkey DNA.

                                     MEPHESTO
                         Precisely. But look how rapidly its 
                         dividing.

                                     CHEF
                         What does it mean?

                                     MEPHESTO
                         It means the turkeys are growing at 
                         an exponential rate. If we don't 
                         destroy them all...

                         the WORLD!!!

                         Aah, lemme' see that Vanessa Redgrave 
                         thing again...

                         Sure.


               Starvin' Marvin sits in the dark in Cartman's living room.

               We hear car doors slam. Starvin' Marvin's eyes grow wide.

               The front door bursts open. Two men in suits burst in.

                                     AGENT 1
                         Hello there little boy, we're looking 
                         for a starving African child who was 
                         accidentally sent here instead of a 
                         Taiko Sports Watch.

               Marvin thinks for a LONG time...

               Finally, Marvin points to Cartman's bedroom. The agents exit 
               offscreen.

               We HEAR the agents bust into Cartman's room.

                                     CARTMAN (O.S.)
                         Hey! Hey! What's going on? Hey, let 
                         go of me! I'll kick you in the nuts! 
                         Okay man?

               Marvin is looking in the direction of the bedroom. The agents 
               enter. One has Cartman wrapped in a blanket slung over his 
               shoulder. We HEAR Cartman mumbling.

                                     AGENT 1
                              (TO Marvin)
                         Here's your sports watch, son. Sorry 
                         for the mix up.

               Marvin takes the watch. The agents leave.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (O.S. and distant)
                         HEY!!!! seriously. You're pissing me 
                         off...

               We HEAR the screech of tires. There is a pause. Marvin looks 
               down at the watch on his wrist. Then he looks up.

                                     STARVIN' MARVIN
                         Sweeeet.

                                   COMMERCIAL BREAK #2


               Starvin' Marvin is sitting on Cartman's couch eating a pot-
               pie and watching TV.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               Terrance and Phillip are both wearing pilgrim costumes sitting 
               at a thanksgiving table with Native Americans.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?

                                     PHILLIP
                         Beans? Oh, oh, looks like we'll be 
                         at war with these Indians soon. Wait 
                         wait wait, here it comes... Oh, I 
                         crapped my pants.

               Terrance lets out a good fart. They both laugh. Marvin laughs.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Oh, I think you got some spatter on 
                         Chief Running Wolf!

                                     TERRANCE
                         I spattered his face.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Now he's a smelly Indian.

                         the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving 
                         Special right after this:


               Marvin smiles at the television and takes another bite of 
               his pot-pie.

                                     CARTMAN'S MOM
                              (Leaning in)

                         hon?

               Marvin thinks...

                                     STARVIN' MARVIN
                         Ya I won da cheesy poof!

                         Sweet.


               The inside is incredible. STACKS upon STACKS of food!

               Cheesy Poofs, Pot-pie's, Snacky cakes!!

               Cartman's eyes grow huge.

               There's a big screen television, a beautiful stereo and a 
               decadent furniture set.

               Cartman rounds the corner to find a fat white woman sitting 
               on the couch eating cake, watching T.V., and being fanned by 
               two Ethiopians.

                                     CARTMAN

               Kenny's family (mother, father, sister, brother) are gathered 
               around a humble table. The dishes are set, and in the middle 
               of the table, on a little serving tray, is the can of green 
               beans.

               The family joins hands in prayer.

                                     KENNY'S FATHER
                              (Sarcastically)
                         Lord, on this day of thanks we would 
                         like to extend our DEEPEST gratitude 
                         for this INCREDIBLE BOUNTY of green 
                         beans you have bestowed upon us. And 
                         though you for some reason found it 
                         necessary to take our son from us, 
                         and though you for some reason find 
                         pleasure in watching us suffer... 
                         Still, we give thanks... Amen.

                                     FAMILY
                         Amen.

               The family sits there for a long time.

                                     KENNY'S MOTHER
                         ...Does anybody have a can opener?

               Silence.

                                     KENNY'S FATHER
                         God dammit.

                                         THE END
