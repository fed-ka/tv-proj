      A BIKE whines down a dark street, pulls to a curb.  RICHIE
      props the kickstand and gets off, starts to move away --
      then he gets the BUZZ.  He looks around.  There's no sign of
      the other Immortal, but they're close, he can feel it.

      He draws his sword and moves warily along the street, senses
      on edge, pausing at shadows and darkened stoops.  His sense
      of danger is growing.  He hears his heart pounding in his
      ears, until it drowns out everything else.  As he passes an
      ALLEYWAY and continues --

      A DARK FIGURE slides into view behind him.

      Richie feels the presence.  He whirls around, sword up,
      bracing for an attack -- but what he hears is a calm voice
      with an air of quiet strength.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm Richie Ryan.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Don't be afraid, Richie Ryan.

      Who the hell does this guy think he is?  Richie smells a
      trick, maneuvers to meet the expected charge.

                                      RICHIE
                          (pumped)
                    What makes you think I'm scared?

                                      MESSENGER
                    You're holding your sword.

      There's gentle reproof in the tone.  Richie snorts, takes a
      better grip on his sword.

                                      RICHIE
                    You got that right, Einstein.

                                      MESSENGER
                    But all I want to do is talk.

                                      RICHIE
                    What about?  The weather?

                    Or what you're gonna do with my head?

      The Immortal steps into the light: he's tall, bearded, with
      intelligent eyes and a gentle, regal composure.  Later we
      come to call him Messenger, but for now he has no name.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Peace.

      The word hangs in the air, simple and surprising.

                                      RICHIE
                    Good line, pal...  but no dice.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I swear you're in no danger.  I
                    stopped taking heads a long time
                    ago.

      He opens his coat, revealing that he has no sword.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    I'm not armed.

      Richie edges back, not sure whether the guy is crazy, or
      setting him up.

                                      RICHIE
                    Everyone carries a sword.  Everyone
                    takes heads...  we fight or we die.

                                      MESSENGER

      His voice is earnest, compelling, but Richie doesn't seem to
      buy it.  He raises his sword.

                                      RICHIE
                    Who are you?

      And as Richie stares, the Messenger kneels before him, raises
      his head so his neck is bared, open to attack.  He looks
      into Richie's face.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)

      Richie's blade still looms over the Messenger as we --

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A waterside area, with various BOATHOUSES and repair sheds. 
      Moored along the dock is a large, older SAILBOAT.

      MacLeod is on the deck, looking over the boat while HARRY, a
      crusty, grizzled Walter Brennan type sailor he's dealt with
      before, looks on.  MacLeod checks some rigging, then swings
      back onto the dock beside Harry.

                                      HARRY
                    Thought your friend was comin'.

      MacLeod shrugs, picks up a rag.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Richie gets here when he gets here.

      He wipes his hands with a rag as Harry re-tamps his pipe. 
      They look at the boat a BEAT.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You were right, Harry.  She's got
                    good lines...  but she needs a major
                    re-fit.

      Harry nods affably, starts lighting his pipe.

                                      HARRY
                    Yep.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Could have some rot below the
                      waterline.  Engine's taken salt. 
                    New rigging all 'round...
                          (beat)
                    She's not worth fifty-thousand, Harry. 
                    Not even forty.

                                      HARRY
                          (agreeably)
                    Nope.

      MacLeod looks at him, piqued.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So why didn't you tell me that over
                    the phone?

                                      HARRY
                      Because...  she'll go for twenty.

      He smiles craftily.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You old fart.

      He breaks into a slow smile, then gets the BUZZ.  He turns,
      expecting Richie, but his face goes cold as he sees --

      WILLIAM CULBRAITH

      thirtyish, a hard-faced immortal with a long scar down one
      cheek.  Culbraith gives a curt nod of recognition, then he
      lifts his blade and points to a nearby BOATHOUSE.  The
      invitation is clear: follow and fight.

      MacLeod reacts...  he will need no urging.

                                      HARRY
                    So, you want her?

                                      MACLEOD
                    We'll talk later.

      MACLEOD

      drops the rag and moves after Culbraith, his face hard with
      anger: whoever this guy is, MacLeod wants to take him out. 
      As MacLeod steps into the BOATHOUSE --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      MacLeod and JEFFREY, a recently freed slave, are running
      through the woods.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      A Confederate PATROL is moving through the trees, on the
      alert.

      MACLEOD AND JEFFREY

      splash through a stream.  Jeffrey stumbles and MacLeod slows.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let's stop a minute.

      Jeffrey comes to a stop, breathing hard, resting hands on
      thighs as he recovers from the run.

      MacLeod is winded as well.  He takes a swig from his canteen,
      offers it to Jeffrey.  Jeffrey is reaching for it when

      MACLEOD

      reacts to the sound of a branch breaking.

      TWO CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS

      step out from behind the trees nearby, guns leveled at MacLeod
      and Jeffrey.

      JEFFREY

      raises his hands slowly.

                                      JEFFREY (CONT'D)
                    You got us.

                                      CONFEDERATE
                    You bet we do.

      He cocks his rifle to fire.  Jeffrey's eyes widen in fear. 
      MACLEOD reaches for his pistol.  The Confederate Soldier
      swings his rifle toward MacLeod -- as he expected -- but:

                                      JEFFREY
                    NO!

      JEFFREY

      rushes in front of MacLeod.  He takes the bullet in the leg. 
      He goes down hard as

      TWO MORE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS

      emerge from cover.  MacLeod and Jeffrey are surrounded. 

      MACLEOD

      crouches over Jeffrey, stemming the blood, his gun forgotten
      on the ground beside him.  A soldier prods him with a rifle
      barrel.

                                      CONFEDERATE
                    On your feet.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That bullet shattered his leg.  He
                    can't walk!

                                      CONFEDERATE
                    Then you're gonna carry him.

      He points MacLeod's pistol at Jeffrey's head.

                                      CONFEDERATE (CONT'D)
                    Or he's staying here.

      MacLeod helps Jeffrey up.


      A wooden stockade, with high walls, and a fenced off HUT at
      one end.  Through the FORT GATES, several UNION PRISONERS
      are marched at bayonet-point by thin, predatory CONFEDERATE
      GUARDS.  The new arrivals are mostly intact: uniformed and
        disciplined, with some walking wounded.  Among them --

      MacLeod, wearing civvies, helps JEFFREY, a young ex-slave. 
      Jeffrey has a stained bandana tied around a leg wound, and
      he limps painfully.

                                      JEFFREY
                    We don't belong in here, Mr. MacLeod. 
                    We ain't even soldiers.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We'll be okay, Jeffrey.  Just stay
                    close.  I'm gonna take care of you.

      Jeffrey is too slow, and HICKSON, a tough Confederate Sergeant
      with a handlebar moustache, prods him.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Let him be.  Can't you see he's
                    wounded?

                                      HICKSON
                    You ride with the devil, you fry

                          (re Jeffrey)
                    And tell the slave he better hurry.

      He gestures with his gun, and they move up to join the rest
      of the soldiers, who are stopped in a line, staring in stunned
      silence at the sight before them.  GREENWELL, the Union
      Sargeant, removes his cap.

                                      GREENWELL
                    Sweet Jesus.

      A tattered horde of UNION PRISONERS shoe-horned into the
      stockade.  Uniforms frayed or non-existent.  Some on crutches,
      limbless, wearing filthy bandages.

      Gaunt faces, untrimmed hair and beards.

      MEN

      Hickson grins at the new arrivals.

                                      HICKSON
                    Welcome to Hell, boys.

      He salutes mockingly, and the Guards move off.  As the
      soldiers stand there, some rattier long-time inmates approach
      the newcomers.  One INMATE runs a hand hungrily down Jeffrey's
      arm.

      Jeffrey throws a stricken look at MacLeod.  MacLeod grabs
      the man's arm, shoves him stumbling back into the dirt.

      Greenwell is staring at the prisoners, sickened.

                                      GREENWELL
                    God help me.  These are Union
                    soldiers.

                                      MACLEOD
                    They were.

      Greenwell grabs the Inmate, drags him to his feet.

                                      GREENWELL
                    Who's in charge of this hell-hole?

      Before anyone can speak -- BANG -- a GUARD fires his gun in
      the air, and SILENCE instantly blankets the stockade.  Every
      eye turns to the HUT, fixed on the door there.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I believe we're about to find out.

      MacLeod feels the BUZZ, and a moment later --

      CULBRAITH

      a Confederate Colonel, steps out onto the porch.  He surveys
      the rabble before him with almost a look of dread.

      The prisoners freeze, watching him in utter silence: the
      cold eyes, the scarred face.  Feeling the BUZZ, Culbraith's
      eyes rake the crowd -- linger briefly on MacLeod -- then
      move on.  He addresses the camp in a grave voice.  What he's
      about to do gives him no pleasure.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    I have warned you.  There is no escape
                    from Andersonville prison.  It is
                    futile.  It is suicidal.  To those
                    who try and to others.

      He nods to the Hickson, on one side of the stockade, where
      three guards drag four ragged UNION PRISONERS before the
      stockade wall.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    You know the rules -- one man tries
                    to escape, he and three others die.

      A shocked MURMUR from the assembled prisoners.

                    SILENCE!
                          (beat)
                    It's a harsh lesson, but it is one
                    you have forced me to teach.

      He nods his head.  Hickson raises his arm: the GUARDS level
      their rifles, prepare to fire at the prisoners.

      MACLEOD

      surges forward.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You can't!  This is murder!

      Culbraith freezes, raises a hand -- stalling the execution. 
      MacLeod holds Culbraith's eyes.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    No one can question my authority
                    here.
                          (to a Guard)
                    Bring him to my quarters.

      The GUARD drives a rifle butt into MacLeod's head.  MacLeod
      goes down in a heap.  Culbraith turns on his heel and steps
      inside, leaving MacLeod lying there.


      MacLeod moves along the docks, pissed, Richie trying to catch
      up.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, would you give me a chance to
                    explain!

                                      MACLEOD
                    What's to explain?  Because of you
                    that murdering bastard is still alive.

                                      RICHIE
                    I know.

      The calm way he says this stops MacLeod.  He stares at Richie.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You wanted Culbraith to live?  Do
                    you have any idea what he is?

                                      RICHIE
                    It doesn't matter.  It has to stop.

      MacLeod stares at Richie like he's flipped.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What has to stop?

                                      RICHIE
                    All of it.  The fighting, taking
                    heads, dying...  It's time to end
                    it, Mac.
                          (beat)
                    We can end it.

      MacLeod sees the light of conviction in Richie's eyes.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because you say so?

      He starts to walk away.

                                      RICHIE
                    Just hear me out!  Someone taught
                    you to kill, right?  Someone taught
                    that to him...  and someone before
                    that.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because that's the way it is.

                                      RICHIE
                    Why is that the way it is?
                          (beat)
                    I'm talking about peace, Mac.  All
                    of us, living in peace.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It can't happen.

                                      RICHIE
                    Why?

                    Because of men like Culbraith.

      His eyes fall on a TAR POT where someone is heating tar to
      patch a hull.  And OFF the flames --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      A small FIRE near makeshift tents.  MacLeod and Jeffrey are
      with Greenwell and a few Soldiers.  Jeffrey lies on a blanket,
      shivering and sweating as MacLeod prepares to look at his
      leg.  He puts on a brave front.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's going to hurt, Jeffrey.

                                      JEFFREY
                    You go ahead, Mr. MacLeod.  You do
                    what you have to.

      As MacLeod works, Jeffrey prattles on out of nervousness.

                                      JEFFREY (CONT'D)
                    Tell me again how my Sarah looked.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Beautiful, Jeffrey, but you know
                    that.

                                      JEFFREY
                    And she's waiting for me.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'd be honored.

      MacLeod rips open Jeffrey's pant leg, revealing the wound --
      and tries to hide his reaction.  It's as bad as it gets. 
      Jeffrey looks at MacLeod hopefully.

                                      JEFFREY
                    How is it?  It's better, ain't it?

      MacLeod covers up the leg.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

                    It's the gangrene.

      Jeffrey stares, then shakes his head in denial.

                                      JEFFREY
                    It can't be.  I feel better, Mr.
                    MacLeod.  The leg don't hurt any
                    more...

                                      MACLEOD
                    The nerves are dead.
                          (harder)
                    Jeffrey, the leg's got to come off. 
                    If it doesn't, it'll spread.  You'll
                    die.

      Jeffrey closes his eyes, shaking his head.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    It's not the end.  You'll live...
                    You'll still have children.

                                      JEFFREY
                    Just won't be able to run no races
                    with 'em.

      He manages a weak smile.  The kid has heart.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Keep still.  I'm going after a doctor.

      He stands and heads off into the dark.  Greenwell looks at
      Jeffrey and shakes his head.


      Jeffrey looks worse than before.  MacLeod settles on the
      ground beside him and wipes his forehead.

                                      JEFFREY
                    I didn't figure he'd come.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You have to hold on, Jeffrey.  'Til
                    tomorrow morning.

                                      JEFFREY
                    I can wait.  It's not like I'm real
                    anxious to see him.

      He manages a weak smile, and coughs.  MacLeod gives him a
      sip of water from a canteen.  Jeffrey sighs and settle back.

                                      JEFFREY (CONT'D)
                    Mr. MacLeod?  Thank you.

                                      MACLEOD
                    For what?  I'm the one who got you
                    into this.

                    Get some rest, Jeffrey.

      Jeffrey closes his eyes.  MacLeod stays awake, looking up at
      the night sky.  And OFF this --


      As MacLeod moves back to Jeffrey, sits beside him.  Jeffrey
      is breathing hard, bathed in sweat.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sorry.

      It's all he can say.  Jeffrey closes his eyes in anguish,
      knowing the doctor isn't coming, that there's no hope.

                                      JEFFREY
                    You tried.  You did what you could.

      MacLeod cradles Jeffrey, holding his head up, wipes his
      fevered brow.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It wasn't enough.

      Jeffrey winces, the poisoned flesh burning through his body
      like a hot poker.

                                      JEFFREY

      MacLeod looks up and sees --

      CULBRAITH

      standing at the hut, hands behind his back, watching him
      coldly.

      MacLeod locks eyes with him.  On his face, sorrow for what
      he has to do -- and hate for Culbraith for making him do it. 
      He talks through his tears.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Look at the sky, Jeffrey.

      Jeffrey's fevered eyes lift up, see it -- and gleam with
      light.  MacLeod's eyes are still on Culbraith.

                                      JEFFREY
                    God bless you, sir.

      MacLeod suddenly WRENCHES hard -- and breaks Jeffrey's neck. 
      Jeffrey flinches once -- then lies still in his arms, all
      pain flooding from his body forever.

      Still staring at Culbraith, MacLeod closes Jeffrey's eyes.

      Culbraith shows no expression.  He turns and steps back into
      the hut.

      Messenger is near his porch, gardening in pots, when he gets
      the BUZZ.  He looks up -- to find the real Methos standing
      watching him with a quizzical look.

                                      METHOS
                    Methos, I presume.

      Messenger nods.

                                      MESSENGER
                    So they tell me.

                                      METHOS
                      Interesting.  I'd always heard you
                    were a myth, but you seem quite real.
                          (beat)
                    Tell me, is it true Socrates was a
                    friend of yours?

                                      MESSENGER
                    I've had many friends.

                                      METHOS
                    And I've always wondered what
                    Cleopatra was really like.

                                      MESSENGER
                    She was a woman like other women. 
                    She loved, she lived, she died.

                                      METHOS
                    Speaking of death...  You do seem
                    quite...  vulnerable.

      As he says this, he takes out his sword with studied
      casualness, examines it.  The threat is obvious, but Messenger
      doesn't react to it.

                                      MESSENGER
                    We're all vulnerable.

      Methos toys with his sword, his tone conversational.

                                      METHOS
                    More for you, I think.
                          (a look)
                    A lot of people might want the head
                    of a five-thousand year-old man.

      He swishes the sword experimentally.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Perhaps.  But they also listen to a
                      five-thousand year-old man.

                                      METHOS
                    I suppose they would.  I mean, fifty
                    centuries must have taught you a
                    lot.  Knowledge, wisdom...  that
                    sort of thing.

                                      MESSENGER
                    That's what people think.  Truth is,
                    my beliefs are very simple.

                                      METHOS
                    Ah, yes.  I've heard about those
                    beliefs.  You really believe there's
                    no such thing as evil?

                                      MESSENGER
                    Only fear.

                                      METHOS
                    So men like Genghis Khan and Hitler
                    were only children acting out?

                                      MESSENGER
                    They were men driven by fear to commit
                    evil acts.

                                      METHOS
                          (with sarcasm)
                    And I suppose if their mothers had
                    truly loved them, the world would
                    have been different?

                                      MESSENGER
                      Perhaps...  Can you say it wouldn't?

                                      METHOS
                          (curious)
                    And you really think it's possible
                    to end "The Game?"

                                      MESSENGER
                    I believe it's worth trying.

                                      METHOS
                    Even if it costs your life?

      Messenger smiles the smile of a Gandhi.

                    What else is my life good for?
                          (beat)
                    How could anyone look back on five-
                    thousand years and say they'd done
                    nothing?  Risked nothing?  Merely
                    stayed alive?
                          (a smile)
                    It would be pointless.

      It's as if he's looking right into Methos.

                                      METHOS
                    Some might think all that experience
                    is worth saving.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    I don't think so -- but we could
                    talk about it.

      He gestures toward the garden chairs.

                                      METHOS
                          (beat)
                    I'm afraid I have a prior engagement.

      He turns and starts off.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I didn't catch your name.

                                      METHOS
                    That's right.  You didn't.

      He flashes an inscrutable look, then leaves.  Messenger looks
      after him a BEAT, then returns to his flowers.


      The Messenger is sitting there saying nothing, just looking
      at Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    What is it?

      The silence draws out.  Richie grows uncomfortable.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    I've been here for twenty minutes
                    and you haven't said a word.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Go home, Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    Why?  What'd I do?

                                      MESSENGER
                    Your sword.

      He smiles gently.  Richie's hand goes to it.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    It's all right.  You'll give it up
                    when the time is right.

                                      RICHIE
                    You're pissed.

                                      MESSENGER
                    No...  but I'd rather not have weapons
                    in my presence.

                                      RICHIE
                            (struggling)
                    It goes against everything I was
                    taught.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I know.

      He stands, moves around the garden.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    The Spartans left their children on
                      a hillside to die.  It wasn't right... 
                    but it's what they were taught.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    We all kill because we're taught to
                    kill.  Because we fear death.

      Richie meets his eyes.

                                      RICHIE
                    Aren't you afraid to die?

                                      MESSENGER
                    Of course.  I'm not a fool.
                          (beat)
                    You wonder if that's why I'm doing
                    all this.  Because I'm afraid to
                    fight.

      He pulls a STAVE from the garden and tosses it to Richie.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Come at me.

                                      RICHIE
                    Look, I didn't mean anything...

                                      MESSENGER
                    Come at me.  Please.

      He gestures invitingly.  Richie makes a half-hearted thrust --
      Messenger dodges it easily.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    You can do better than that.

      Richie winds up, takes a serious swing.  Messenger dodges
      the stick, grabs Richie, and throws him on his ass.

      Richie, a bit nettled, picks himself up.

                                      RICHIE
                    I wasn't ready.

                                      MESSENGER
                    This time, use your sword.
                          (off Richie's look)
                    Go ahead.  Strike.

      His voice is quietly commanding.  Richie hesitates, then
      takes his sword out.  Still he hesitates.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    Strike!

                                      RICHIE
                    No.

      He slaps Richie hard across the face.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Strike!

      Richie whirls on instinct, his blade slices down --

      THE MESSENGER

      makes a miraculous move and disarms Richie.  In an instant,
      he's holding Richie's sword an inch from Richie's neck.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, but I needed to make a point.
                          (beat)
                    They say the best peacemaker is a
                    man experienced at war.  It's not
                    that I can't fight...  it's that I
                    won't kill.

      He reverses the sword and hands it back.  Richie takes it,
      humbled.

                                      RICHIE
                          (re his sword)
                    That's why you don't like them around.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I don't want the temptation or the
                      opportunity.  My defense is my faith.
                          (a smile)
                    So far, it's worked.

                                      RICHIE
                    Sorry I doubted you.

      Messenger turns a disapproving look on him.

                                      MESSENGER
                    Richie, don't believe because of my
                    strength.  Believe because of yours. 
                    Because you want to.

                                      RICHIE
                    But I do want to.  Why else am I
                    here?

                                      MESSENGER
                    Listen to me.  If you do this...  if
                    you join me...  you may die.  Others
                    have.
                          (beat)
                    You're risking everything, Richie. 
                    Don't let go of that blade unless
                    you're sure.

      He turns and heads toward his cottage, leaving Richie there. 
      OFF Richie's look --



      Messenger steps onto the porch, following the BUZZ.  He peers
      into the gloom --

      Culbraith steps from the shadows.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    You're not hard to find.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I don't try to be.

      Culbraith steps onto the porch.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    I thought about what you said.
                          (beat)
                    About what I was.  How I came to be

                    It wasn't your choice, William.
                          (beat)
                    You were made into what you are.

                    And you think I could change?

                                      MESSENGER
                    I know you could.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Only if I wanted to...  and I don't.

                    I don't believe that.

      Culbraith draws his sword.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    This is a mistake, William.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Your mistake.  I'll have the head of
                    Methos.

      He moves closer.  Messenger draws himself up, seeming to
      gain spiritual height, strength.

                                      MESSENGER
                    I know what I saw in your heart...

                    And this is what you found.

      He raises his sword.  Messenger doesn't flinch.

                                      MESSENGER
                    If this is what's in your heart, to
                    kill an unarmed man...
                          (the Messenger kneels)
                    ... who kneels before you... 
                          (beat)
                    Then I was wrong.

      He looks Culbraith in the eyes.

                                      MESSENGER (CONT'D)
                    But I don't believe I was wrong.

      There's enormous conviction in his eyes, his voice.  He holds
      the look for a moment -- then inclines his head.

      Culbraith looks at him kneeling there, neck exposed, waiting.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Believe this.

      Then suddenly -- Culbraith whirls and STRIKES.  And off the
      sword stroke --

                                                                              FADE OUT.96509     "The Messenger"     44.     Final Shooting Script 9/16/96

      Richie arrives.  He starts up the steps, hearing the steady
      SQUEAK of Messenger's rocking chair.  He reaches the porch --
      and stops.  Instead of the Messenger, Culbraith sits there,
      rocking quietly.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Didn't mean to surprise you.
                          (beat)
                    I never thanked you for saving me.

      Richie feels a twinge of hesitation, but his newfound
      conviction overcomes it.  He moves up toward Culbraith.

                                      RICHIE
                    It's what he teaches.

      He means the Messenger.  Culbraith nods.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Never met anyone quite like the old
                    man.  It's hard to believe he lived
                    so long without a sword.
                          (beat)
                    How are you managing it?

                                      RICHIE
                    Faith can take you a long way.
                          (beat)
                    You?

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Me?
                          (beat)
                    I'm afraid I had no faith.

      He rises and his sword is in his hand.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    No faith at all.

      Richie backs off as Culbraith advances.

                                      RICHIE
                    Don't.  You know this is wrong!

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Is it?  I guess old habits die hard.

      Richie is backing away, talking desperately.

                                      RICHIE
                    But he saved your life!  Didn't you
                    listen to him?!

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Right up to the end.
                          (curious)
                    Are you going to make it as easy as
                    he did...  or put up a fight?

      Richie stares in horror.

                                      RICHIE
                    All he wanted was to save us!  To
                    stop the killing!

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Only one problem, son.
                          (beat)
                    I came to like the killing.

      He SWINGS.  Richie dodges, and the sword strikes the chair,
      splintering it.  Richie turns and vaults off the porch, into
      the darkness.

      Culbraith moves after Richie.


      Richie scrambles along the beach, Culbraith right after him. 
      Richie grabs a length of WOOD RAILING, and brandishes it.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Putting up a fight.
                          (beat)
                    I guess when you get down to it,
                    we're all the same.

                                      RICHIE
                    Not all of us.  He wasn't.

      Culbraith swings -- and cuts the wood in two.  His next slice
      catches Richie's chest.

      Richie stumbles back in the sand, wounded, and angry.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    You bastard!

                                      CULBRAITH
                          (approving)
                    That's the spirit.  We were made for
                    war.

      He raise his sword to take Richie's head -- and gets the
      BUZZ.  He hesitates, sword aloft, not turning.

                                      CULBRAITH (CONT'D)
                    The battle's been joined.  You can't
                      interfere.

      MacLeod stands there.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I wouldn't think of it.

      He unfolds his arms to reveal Richie s SWORD.  He tosses it.

      ON THE SWORD

      catching the light as it arcs through the air.

      RICHIE

      catches it and lunges forward with three fast, hard blows,
      forcing Culbraith backwards.

      Culbraith goes to his knees.  He looks up with cold defiance,
      knowing he's finished.

                                      CULBRAITH
                    Is this the part where I beg for
                    mercy?  Or where you tell me we don't
                    have to do this?

                                      RICHIE
                    Neither.

      He swings, and Culbraith falls.  As the QUICKENING strikes,
      logs ignite, and fire swirls up into the sky.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
