    - as they enter - a ZOOMING BEAUTY PASS shows off Lost s main 
      standing set... The Valley.  The Valley is much as Jack left 
      it last episode - including a huge pile of airplane wreckage 
      on a corner by the spring.

                                  JACK
                    This is it.

                                  LOCKE
                    It s amazing.*

                                    CHARLIE
                          (off Locke)
                      Absolutely... it s totally you.

      Locke looks away from Charlie.  Kate, turns to Jack --

                                  KATE
                    Some luck.

      Jack nods, then walks towards the SPRING.  Kate follows.  
      Charlie, however, stops by the wreckage and looks around:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hey - guys... shouldn t somebody 
                    look through this stuff?  See if 
                    there s anything useful in there?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"    (YELLOW)      8/20/04     8.
      (CONT'D):88


      Charlie looks for affirmation - but Jack and Kate are busy 
      filling water bottles.  Locke, however, takes Charlie s bait:

                                  LOCKE
                    He s got a point.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I do?

      Jack turns from his water gathering:

                                  JACK
                    Yeah.  Bring me your bottles - keep 
                    your eye out for any medical 
                    supplies - drugs in particular.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Drugs.  Right.

      Locke drops his backpack and steps up to the wreckage.  
      Charlie grabs Locke s pack and takes it and his own to Jack, 
      who barely acknowledges him as he drops them by his side.

      Charlie watches Locke become engrossed, then looks at Jack 
      and Kate, busy with there water collection - and at his own 
      hand.  It s trembling.  Time for another hit.

      Charlie backs away, slowly getting himself out of eyeshot, 
      then turns a corner into one of the stone passages out to -


    A nightmare.  BEES EVERYWHERE.  Jack and Kate chew through 
      The Valley, instinctively PULLING OFF their bee-infested 
      clothes.  As they power deeper and deeper into safety -

      Jack WHIPS his shirt against the cave wall - killing the bees 
      in his shirt.  Kate frantically shakes insects from her hair.   *
      Reaching the rear of The Valley, Kate backs up into the cave  *
      wall -*

    - and turns to see something entombed in a niche behind her -  *
    A HUMAN SKELETON.  Grey.  Desiccated.  Jaw WIDE OPEN.

      Kate GASPS -- Tries to scramble away - but the floor is  *
      SLIPPERY...

      And she WIPES OUT - to find herself cheek-to-cheek with a *
      second skeleton entombed in another niche on the wall! *

      And, as Kate CRIES OUT...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:


                                  END OF ACT ONE
















                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"    (YELLOW)      8/20/04     15.


                                        ACT TWO


      Kate writhes between the skeletons - trying to scramble to 
      her feet when Jack s hand reaches in -

                                  JACK
                    It s OK - it s OK...

    - Kate takes his hand.  He pulls her up -

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    ...the bees are gone.

    - Jack looks down at Kate - slowly realizing just how little 
      they are wearing, and how close they are to one another.  Is 
      the moment sexually charged?  Yes.  Then --

                                  KATE
                      There s... skeletons.
                          (off Jack s look)
                      Skeletons.  Dead people.

      Jack lets go of her hand, snapping back to his normal self as 
      he steps away and looks past her to see the TWO SKELETONS... 
      and as he looks, everything seems to vanish.  Jack kneels 
      down, STUDIES them, TRANSFIXED.  Kate asks the question we re 
      all wanting the answer to --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Who are they?  How d they...

                                  JACK
                    I can t exactly perform an 
                      autopsy... but there doesn t seem 
                    to be any major trauma to their 
                    bones... someone laid them to rest *
                    here...*

      Kate moves up beside Jack, kneels down next to him as he 
      indicates what he means --

                                  KATE
                    Who?*

                                  JACK
                    Don t know.

                                  KATE
                    Where d they come from?

                                  JACK
                    Didn t you guys shoot a polar bear 
                    last week?

                                  KATE
                    Yeah...?

                                  JACK
                    Where d that come from?

      Kate shakes her head, almost stifles a grin.  Then --

                                  KATE
                    Any idea how long they ve -

      Jack gently runs his fingers over the unrecognizable TATTERED 
      CLOTHES hanging off the bones...

                                  JACK
                    Long.  Takes forty, fifty years for 
                    clothing to degrade like this...

      Jack FEELS something in what might have been a POCKET at one  *
      point.  Slowly removes A TINY LEATHER BAG.  A small piece of 
      TWINE binds it closed...*

                                  KATE
                    What is it?

      Jack slowly undoes the twine, then turns the bag over his  *
      open hand and taps out -- TWO HIGHLY POLISHED STONES.  The 
      LIGHT glints off their shiny surface - and it s quite clear -- *

      One is black.  One is white.

                                    LOCKE S VOICE
                    Hello!  Anybody in there?

      Jack carefully drops the STONES back into the bag, puts it 
      into his OWN POCKET as he turns towards the entrance --

                                  JACK
                    Over here...

      Locke and Charlie approach.  Charlie has prominent bee stings *
      on his neck and forehead...

                                  LOCKE
                    Everyone all right?

                                                                                              *

                        JACKKATE
    A few stings aside.Yeah.  OK.

                                    CHARLIE
                      Brilliant.  You two run away 
                      fantastically.  Well done.  I m 
                    glad my diversion spared you.  I 
                    was only stung several hundred 
                    times.  Oh -- and...

      Charlie produces KATE S SHIRT from behind his back -

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Someone dropped this.

      Kate sheepishly takes her shirt back --

                                  KATE
                    It was full of bees.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I d have thought  C s , actually.

      Charlie chuckles... but neither Jack nor Locke share the 
      mirth.  And that s when Charlie spots THE SKELETONS --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Bloody hell!  Are those the guys 
                    who were here before us?

      Locke trains his glare at Charlie - HE DOESN T KNOW ABOUT THE 
      FRENCH BROADCAST FROM THE PILOT EPISODE - and Charlie may 
      have just let the cat out of the bag.

    A pause.  Locke looks at Charlie: intrigued.

                                  LOCKE
                    What are you talking about?

      Charlie looks at Kate and Jack - busted?  The three exchange 
      conspiratorial looks.  Charlie tries to cover up --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Nothing.  I mean - just... there 
                    could have been people - here - 
                    before us, right?

      Locke holds Charlie s glance, then kneels over the skeletons -

                                  LOCKE
                    This would prove it, but who are 
                    these men?
                                                                                              *

                                  JACK*
                    Actually, one of them s female.*

                                  LOCKE
                    Our very own Adam and Eve.

      And OFF this revelation...


      Sun and Jin s home as a married couple.  The spacious and 
      well-appointed place gives a strong visual cue that they have 
      been building a life together for some time.*

      Sun enters carrying some shopping bags.  The place is dark -  *
      lit only by the Seoul city lights... but Sun can clearly see  *
      the large, gift-wrapped box in the center of the living room.  
      She approaches - and opens the box to find -

    - the cutest SHAR-PEI puppy ever seen on American Network 
      Television.  Sun regards the dog with mixed emotions - like 
      someone who has just discovered a newborn at her doorstep.

                                  JIN S VOICE
                    What do you think?

      Sun turns to see her smiling husband: shirt sleeves rolled up 
      and tie undone around his neck - a man who has grown 
      comfortable with the garb of a businessman.

                                  SUN
                    It s... a puppy...

      Jin puts his arms around Sun as she holds up the puppy: but 
      the look on her face is one of apprehension and sadness.  Jin 
      doesn t notice at first -

                                  JIN
                    You like it.  Good.  It was sired 
                    by a champion.  The breeder has a 
                    two-year waiting list --
                          (off her look)
                    ...I ve been working such long 
                    hours, I thought you might enjoy 
                    the company.  Of course, you ll 
                    have to train it and feed it but... 
                    they re very loyal and...

    - but eventually sees the faraway look on his wife s face:

                                  JIN (CONT D)
                    Are you OK?

                                  SUN
                    Remember when all you had to give 
                    me was an orchid?






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (GREEN)      8/26/04     20.
      (CONT'D):1717


      It s a fond memory for Sun, but before Jin can reply, his 
      cellphone rings.  Jin looks down at the display -

                                  JIN
                    Your father...

      Jin moves away.  As Sun is left alone with her new puppy and 
      the feeling that her husband has just dropped a huge 
      responsibility in her lap...


      Kate walks across The Valley holding a backpack full of water  *
      bottles when Locke steps up to her.*

                                  LOCKE*
                    I think one of us ought to stay and *
                    help Charlie salvage the wreckage.*

                                  KATE*
                    Are you offering?*

      Locke indicates Charlie picking through the wreckage in the  *
        background.*

                                  LOCKE*
                    Sure.  Gives me a chance to get to *
                    know Mr. Pace a little better. *
                          (off Kate s look)*
                    That s his last name.*

      But before Kate can ask  how did you know that?  Locke has  *
      returned to the wreckage and is helping Charlie.  Kate hikes  *
      up her pack and walks on -*

    - to find JACK.  At the center of The Valley.  Looking at it  *
      all.  Taking it in.  We can almost see the WHEELS TURNING...

                                  KATE
                    Ready to move out?  People are 
                    probably getting thirsty...
                          (off his faraway look)
                    What?

                                  JACK
                    Forty-six people need to drink a 
                    half gallon a day each.  Carrying 
                    all this water back and forth?
                          (turns to Kate)
                    It s gonna be a real pain in the 
                    ass.

                                  KATE
                    You re making me regret 
                      volunteering.

                                  JACK
                    These caves make too good a shelter 
                    to just be used for burial.
                          (off her look)
                    Adam and Eve must have lived here.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (GREEN)      8/26/04     21A.

      And Kate is NOT liking where this is going.  Something 
      INSTINCTUAL kicks in, already emotionally withdrawing...

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    The bodies were placed there 
                    decades, maybe centuries ago.  So 
                    their plane crashed - or maybe they 
                    were shipwrecked - they probably 
                    found this place and knew they 
                    could survive here.  Unlimited 
                    fresh water...

                    storage - and the entrances are

      Jack turns to Kate, EXCITEMENT in his eyes.  For the first 
      time in a long time -- Jack smiles.  His statement is simple.  
      Sure.  And most importantly, full of HOPE --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    I think we can live here.

      Kate processes Jack s words - and while his face beams with 
      an optimism he has never expressed before, the look on Kate s 
      face is not unlike Sun s in the last flashback - uncertain if 
      she s getting a gift or a burden.

      As Jack nods and shoots her a smile...


      Charlie and Locke move a heavy piece of wreckage out of the 
      way to reveal a few mangled suitcases.  Charlie shakes his 
      head and pulls out a brightly-colored sundress - which he 
      tosses aside with much frustration.

                                  CHARLIE
                    This is just brilliant.

      Shaking his head, Charlie heads out of The Valley - until he 
      notices Locke, walking after him -

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Are you following me?

                          (plainly)
                    Yes.

                                    CHARLIE
                    No need - just going to the loo.

      Locke stares at Charlie.*

                                  LOCKE
                    Is there something you want to tell 
                    me, Charlie?

      Charlie stares back - what the hell is this guy s deal?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I m.  Going.  To.  The.  Loo.

      Locke shakes his head, then:

                                  LOCKE
                    It s dangerous out there.  Until we 
                    get back to the beach, I m not 
                    breaking line of sight with you.

                                    CHARLIE
                    This is a joke, right?

                                  LOCKE
                    How are those bee stings?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Oh, bugger off.

      Charlie heads back for the wreckage.  Locke steps up:

                                  LOCKE
                    I know who you are.  And I know 
                    what you re looking for.

      What?  Charlie grabs his trembling hand - has he given 
      himself away?  Locke s words hang in the air, then:




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST   "House of the Rising Sun"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)  8/16/04  26.

                    Drive Shaft.  You played bass.

      Charlie is gobsmacked.  Of all the people to know about his 
      band - is it one of the hot chicks?  The doctor?  The cool 
      guy with the cigarettes?  No.  It s the boar hunting freak!

                                  CHARLIE*
                    And guitar.  On a few tracks. *

                    doesn t mean I m deaf.  I have both 
                    your albums - although - your self-
                    titled debut was a much stronger 
                    effort than  Oil Change. *
                          (off Charlie s look)*
                    That bass line in track six,  Full 
                    Release  - you were on fire.

      And Charlie just absorbs this.  Genuine adulation from Locke.  
      And damn if it doesn t feel GOOD.  That ole  bravado --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Sixteen clean notes in one bar.*

                                  LOCKE
                    Shame what happened to the band.  
                    How long since you last played?

      Charlie s smile FALTERS --

                                    CHARLIE
                    You guitar?  Eight days, eleven *

                                  LOCKE
                    You miss it.

      Charlie shoots Locke a sad, vulnerable nod - Locke has hit on 
    a deeply held truth.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Still a lot of wreckage.  It might 
                    turn up.

      Charlie finally speaks from the heart - his speech making it 
      clear, for the first time, that there is at least one thing 
      more important to him in life than his drugs.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (BLUE)      8/17/04     27.

                                  CHARLIE
                      Undamaged?  Playable?  I don t 
                    think so.  I wish - but - see, 
                    there was this bloke at the counter 
                    what made me check it in.  No room 
                    in the cabin.  Fascist.
                          (then)
                    I had this sick feeling in the pit 
                    of my stomach when they put it on 
                    that belt.  I should have known I d 
                    never see it again.

                                  LOCKE
                    You ll see it again.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  What makes you so sure about 
                    that?

      And when Locke says this, he says it with absolute 
      CONVICTION.  And yeah -- it s a little scary.

                                  LOCKE
                    Because I have faith, Charlie.

      Charlie shoots Locke a  nice try  look - but he s far from 
      reassured.  Charlie goes back to dig through the wreckage.

      Locke looks at Charlie, now knowing that Charlie s need for 
      affirmation is his Achilles heel.


      The place has changed - become more and more ornate.  A 
      gilded cage for Sun - who sleeps on the couch with her now 
      fully-grown Shar-Pei.  A clock reads 4 A.M.  Sun is still in 
      her street clothes - she has been waiting for her husband -

    - who CRASHES through the door.  The lapels on his suit 
      jacket turned up, his hands are jammed into the pockets.

      Sun starts awake.

                                  SUN
                    Jin?

      Sun gets up and rushes to Jin - who heads for the bathroom -

                                  SUN (CONT D)
                    Are you all right?  What s --

    - but Jin ignores her - brushing past her and into - *



























                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"    (YELLOW)      8/20/04     29.




    - Sun follows Jin inside -*

                                  SUN*
                    Please talk to me -*

    - just in time to see him drop his jacket - and that s when  *
      she realizes that his hands and shirt are STAINED WITH BLOOD. *

                                  SUN (CONT D)*
                    - oh god, are you hurt?  What *
                    happened to you?*

      Jin turns on the faucet and washes his hands.  Rust-colored  *
      water hits the basin.  Sun reaches for Jin s hands - quickly  *
      realizing that the blood on them is not her husband s - *

                                  SUN (CONT D)*
                    Whose blood is this?*

      Jin just keeps washing, facing straight ahead, saying nothing 
    - Sun s panic mounts as she tightens her grip on his hands,  *
      trying to turn him to face her.*

                                  SUN (CONT D)*
                    What were you doing?  What *
                    happened?*

      Jin finally looks at her.*

                                  JIN*
                    I was working.*

      Jin tries to go back to washing his hands, but Sun won t just  *
      accept this - she needs to know -*

                                  SUN*
                    Doing what?  Jin - my father is in *
                    the car business - you couldn t *
                    possibly -*
                          (then)*
                    - what do you do for my father?  *
                    Just answer me - please - Jin - 
                    look at me - what do you do -

    - but he ignores her - and then -

      SLAP!

      Sun belts her husband across the face.  A dread silence 
      follows.  Cold.  Unbearable.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"    (YELLOW)      8/20/04     29A.
      (CONT'D):2424


      At this moment - for the first time - Sun sees the dead  *
      expression in his eyes.  His face has hardened into an 
      expression of loathing unlike anything Sun has ever seen.

      Sun recoils - the fear on her face making is clear that the 
    man before her is not the man she married - as Jin answers 
      her question with chilling calm -

                                  JIN
                    I do whatever your father asks.
                          (then)
                    I do it for us.

    - and there it is, the sad and unavoidable truth of this 
      marriage.  Jin sold his soul for the woman he loves.

                                  JIN (PRE-LAP) (CONT D)
                    - that s the catch - now twist it, 
                    slowly - don t lose it -


      Charlie and Locke pull A SHATTERED GRANDFATHER CLOCK from the 
      wreckage:

                                    CHARLIE
                    A grandfather clock?  Who travels

                                  LOCKE
                    Must have been freight.

      And we can see that Charlie is in a STATE.  Frustrated. Pale, 
      sweaty... needing a fix, goddammit.  Dropping the clock --

                                    CHARLIE

                    mine out of this stinking fuselage!

      Charlie turns to storm out of The Valley, Locke follows.

                    What is it with you?  Don t think I 
                    can handle it?

      Locke gets in front of Charlie - puts a hand on his shoulder - 
      holding him back -

                        LOCKECHARLIE
      Frankly - no.(enough)

                    Listen -

    - and Charlie finally SNAPS, writhing out of Locke s grasp -

                                    CHARLIE
                    No - you listen - you don t know 
                    sod-all about dangerous.  Last I 
                    heard, only one of us has seen a 
                    man - THE PILOT OF OUR PLANE - torn 
                    to bits by a beast - and - oh wait, 
                    that was me!  Not that I got a 
                    chance to savor the experience 
                    seeing as I was dodging a falling 
                    cockpit at the time - and as I 
                    remember - it was me, not you, 
                    climbing up a MOUNTAIN and got 
                    jumped by a POLAR BEAR - just to 
                    hear from a Frenchy radio signal 
                    that somehow s been broadcasting 
                    for sixteen years that this island 
                    is a death trap and that everyone 
                    who lands here SNUFFS IT!
                          (beat)
                    And worst of all, I m never going 
                    to find my bloody guitar!

      Charlie finally stops, levelling his coldest, bad-assed-est 
      stare at Locke, who simply stares back.

                                  LOCKE
                    I m still not letting you out of my 
                    sight.

      Charlie drops his stance, defeated.  Locke turns back to the  *
      wreckage - knowing that he has used Charlie s weakness to 
      extract from him every one of the secrets of this island, and 
      Charlie doesn t even know it...

      at the dog.  Sun stands and leads the dog away from her  *
      husband.  Things have changed - the familiar dynamic of Jin s *
      dominance and Sun s submissiveness has taken root completely. *

      Sun returns and exchanges a look with the Decorator who  *
      appears to ignore Jin s humiliating treatment of his wife: *

                                    DECORATOR*
                    Let s look at the place from the *
                    bedroom, shall we?*

      Sun follows the Decorator as she bustles through the  *
      apartment, out of Jin s view, and into:*


      And as soon as they re out of earshot, the CHARADE IS OVER.   *
      The Decorator s smile DROPS and her tone of voice becomes a *
      deadly serious whisper - whoever this woman is, it s *
      abundantly clear that she is NOT here to decorate:*

                                  DECORATOR*
                    Are you sure about this?*

                                  SUN*
                    Yes.*



                    DECORATORSUN
      You ve taken your lessons?  
      Studied?-- Yes.

      Sun nods.  Whatever they are talking about, it has been *
      DISCUSSED, PLANNED... and is about to become reality: *




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (PINK)      8/19/04     41B.

                                  DECORATOR*
                    You realize that your husband, and *
                    your father will do everything they *
                    can to find you -*
                          (off Sun s nod)*
                    - are you sure you and your husband *
                    can t reconcile - talk?*

      Sun shakes her head, then looks up.*

                                  SUN*
                    When I m gone, will you care for my *
                    dog?*

      The Decorator nods, then hands over the folio:*

                                    DECORATOR*
                    There s no coming back from this.*

      Sun opens the folio - E.C.U. INSIDE THE FOLIO - an American  *
      PASSPORT with Sun s picture.  IDs.  Credit cards.  A Maine *
      driver s license.*

      Sun moves to a dresser, opens a drawer, and pulls out a false *
      bottom, hiding the folio underneath - the promise of a new *
      life mixing with the danger of what she is planning to do - *

                                  DECORATOR (CONT D)*
                    During his business trip.  At the *
                    airport.  At eleven fifteen you *
                    make an excuse and walk out of the *
                    terminal.  Bring nothing.  A car *
                    will be waiting - for the first *
                    week your family will assume you *
                    have been kidnapped.  You will lay *
                    low until they come to think you *
                    are dead.  After that, you will be *
                    free to move wherever you want.  *

                                  SUN*

                    Again.*

      Sun looks into the main room to see JIN, pacing, on the phone  *
      and repeats the words --*

                                  SUN*
                    Eleven fifteen... Eleven fifteen...*

      -- as Sun s courage and resolve grow with each repetition -- *


    - Sun - wearing the clothes seen in the pilot - stands alone  *
      under a big clock.  The time reads 11:13.

      Jin stands in line at the counter a dozen meters away from 
      Sun.  In front of Jin is Jack -- DEJA VU as we recognize his 
      speech from last episode --

                                  JACK
                    In sixteen hours, I need to land in 
                    LAX.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    And I need that coffin to clear 
                    customs because there is going to 
                    be a hearse waiting there.

      Jin shakes his head, wondering  what the hell is this 
      white guy yelling about,  then looks at his watch.  But we re  *
      watching all this from the POINT OF VIEW OF SUN as she looks 
      back up at the clock -

                                  SUN
                    Eleven fifteen - eleven fifteen...

    - then at the glass door out of the terminal.

    A car pulls up to the curb - is this the one?

      Sun looks at her husband - who doesn t notice her.

      She looks up at the clock...

      ...11:15...

      ... and the car is waiting outside... Sun s deliverance from 
    a soul-destroying marriage.

      Escape.  Freedom.  Dead ahead.  Just walk out.

      Sun shoots a final glance at Jin - only this time he makes 
      eye contact - and smiles.  Sun looks at Jin, confused.  He  *
      reaches into his jacket -

    - and pulls out a WHITE ORCHID.

      And everything STOPS.  This is a profound moment.  A LIFE-
      CHANGING MOMENT.  Because in this simple gesture --

      Sun sees the man she loves - trapped somewhere in all the 
      rage and anger - but still very much there.

      But her path is set.  Too late to turn back now.  So -- as a 
      single TEAR falls down her cheek, she turns.  Takes a step 
      toward the exit - toward her FREEDOM -

      And then she stops.  The look on her face tells the story.   *
      She just can t do it.

      For Sun to escape from her husband, her entire life, without 
      trying to somehow redeem the good man she married now feels 
      like an awful thing to do.






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (BLUE)      8/17/04     52.

      Sun turns back to Jin and walks, closing the distance between 
      herself and her husband.

      And as she walks, she drops the black envelope with all of 
      the counterfeit identity documents into a garbage can.

      Sun arrives at her husband s side -

                                  JIN
                    Something wrong?

      Jin hands her the flower, gives her a peck on the cheek.

                                  SUN
                    No.  It s beautiful.

      Jin shrugs.  His wife is crying for no reason.  Women.

      Jack finally moves off the ticket counter and Jin steps up...

      Sun cradles her orchid... and it becomes clear that her 
      decision to stand by Jin - her hope that someday she might be 
      able to reconnect with the optimistic young romantic she 
      married - is exactly what put her on the Oceanic flight and *
      landed her on the island...


    - where Charlie sits in one of the niches on the rockface, 
      cradling his newly-returned instrument.

      Even though his trembling hands and the initial symptoms of 
      withdrawal won t let him hit the notes dead on, every time 
      Charlie hits a string and an un-amplified sound TWANGS from 
      the instrument, he is a happy man.*

      Locke and Charlie exchange nods, then -

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    Hello!

      Charlie and Locke turn to see Jack - entering The Valley with 
      his group.  Locke steps over to meet him:

                                  LOCKE
                    What s this?

      Jack flashes a smile and an  isn t it obvious?  shrug:

                                  JACK
                    New tenants.

      Locke looks at the arriving castaways - some of them go about 
      the task of discovering The Valley right away, but HURLEY -  *
      sits down in the first place he can find -

                                  HURLEY
                    A short walk - they lied.

    - and puts on his headphones.  As the twangy notes from 
      Charlie s guitar blend with the music from Hurley s  *
      headphones.

    A SERIES OF DISSOLVES SET TO THE MUSIC - show the camp 
      forming in The Valley (the music carries through to the end  *
      of the episode.)*


      Jack and several others at the spring - fill up water 
      containers, drink without fear of running out -






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST   "House of the Rising Sun"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)  8/16/04  56.




    - as Sun looks at the wreckage, picks up the sundress 
      previously tossed aside by Charlie, shows it to her husband -


    - while Locke puts together a bonfire in the middle of The 
      Valley.  Jack watches - everyone seems content: whatever Kate  *
      and Sayid might say, this will be a good place to live.

      As the flames gather strength and the assembled group crowds 
      around them -

      MATCH DISSOLVE TO - a log - thrown into a fire at -


      Where Jack watches the bonfire, thinking of Kate...*
