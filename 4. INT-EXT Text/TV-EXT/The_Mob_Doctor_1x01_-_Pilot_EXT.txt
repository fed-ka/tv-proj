      CLOSE ON A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL: GRACE DEVLIN.  Angelic face.  
      Summer party dress.  OVER THIS...  

                                  GRACE (V.O.)
                    The first time I saw a dead body, 
                    it was the neighborhood drunk. 

      REVERSE ANGLE: she s looking at a MAN S DEAD BODY, surrounded 
      by carpetweed and crabgrass.  Shot in the face like an Arthur 
      Fellig gangster.  Broken Jim Beam bottle by his side.  Eyes 
      staring, lifeless. 

                                  GRACE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    He was in this field, not far from 
                    where I grew up.  Bridgeport, 
                    Southside of Chicago. 

      Young Grace kneels beside the body.  Stares at it like most 
      kids admire an anthill. 

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Thing is, I wasn t afraid.  All I 
                    can remember... I really wanted to 
                    touch him.

      She reaches out and tugs at his jacket.  No movement.

                                  GRACE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I don t know why, but I ve been 
                      fascinated with the human body ever 
                    since.  

      Then, she carefully closes the dead man s eyes.  

                                  GRACE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Twenty years later, during my first 
                    week of med school, an attending 
                    told me I d  eventually lose count 
                    of all the bodies.   But after two 
                    hundred thirty seven, I still 
                    remember every one.  

      The little girl stands over the body, captivated.  Then, a  
      MAN S SCREAM CARRIES us INTO --  

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:    Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      2.




      -- the weathered streets of Bridgeport.  Grace climbs into 
      her battered PICKUP.  As she guns the motor and pulls out of 
      the Vet clinic, our CAMERA RISES to --  


      Dying concrete and brick row houses DROP AWAY as we FLY out 
      toward Lake Michigan.  We spot A WHITE SOX GAME at Cellular 
      Field, boats on LAKE MICHIGAN and the gleaming skyscrapers of 
      the DOWNTOWN SKYLINE, punctuated by The Sears Tower.  We 
      SPIRAL DOWN to the pristine, new CHICAGO MEDICAL CENTER -- a 
      teaching hospital, a world away from Bridgeport.     

      And as we PUSH IN on this beacon...

      PRELAP: VIVALDI S  FOUR SEASONS 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Grace s PICKUP SPEEDS toward a THREE GARAGE DOOR WAREHOUSE 
      surrounded by chainlink.  Inside, a dozen cars in various 
      stages of repair.  WELDERS slice and dice.  As sparks fly...

      Grace stops by a black MASERATI with personalized  MORETTI  
      plates, exits the truck and bee-lines for an open bay... when 
      handsome, built FRANCO (30s) steps from the shadows -- 

                                  FRANCO
                    Hey Doc -- 

                                  GRACE
                          (slowing)
                    I m here for Moretti.

      Grace tries to get past him into the darkened bay, but Franco 
      steps in front of her.  The man is sexy and it s clear he has 
      a past with Grace.  That being said, Grace is all business.

                                  FRANCO
                    You re always trying to get away 
                    from me.

                                  GRACE
                    Why re you still working for him, 
                    Franco?  You could do better.

                                  FRANCO
                    I made a 100G s in three months.

                                  GRACE
                    It s not all about money.

                                  FRANCO
                    Says the woman who s gonna clear 
                    half a mil in 2 years.
                          (off her confusion)
                    Your mom s proud of you.  So am I.

      Franco is sincere, and we see a glimpse of a connection, but 
      he s from Grace s past and she s trying to move forward --

                                  GRACE
                    Great.  Now get out of my way.
                          (off his look)
                    Moretti?!  MORETTI -- ?!


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      19.

      A VOICE COMES out of the blackness.

                                    MORETTI (O.S.)
                    Jesus!  Let her in -- 

      Franco shakes his head and steps back as Grace lightly pushes 
      him out of the way.  Eyes on her -- no doubt, he still has 
      feelings for her -- he watches Grace head into the bay and...


      A rowhouse in the once-hardscrabble neighborhood of 
      Bridgeport.  Weathered lawn in front.  Grace s truck is 
      parked out on the street, as we hear a DOOR SLAM and... 

                                  MARIA (PRE-LAP)
                    Look who made it home for taco 
                    night.


      Grace leaves Constantine s home.  Although impressive, with a 
      LONG DRIVEWAY and a GATE, it s seen better days.  Suddenly, 
      Grace is in a CAMERA S CROSSHAIRS.  SNAP!  SNAP!  SNAP!  

      PULL BACK to REVEAL a YOUNG MAN in a BLACK SEDAN shooting 
      away as Grace climbs into her pickup and drives off.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Moretti stands in the shadows at a PAYPHONE.   

                                    MORETTI 
                    Hey, Doc.  Long time, no speak. 

      She looks around.  Needing privacy, she pushes into --


      The quiet neighborhood street is suddenly filled with a ROAR 
      as GRACE S PICKUP SKIDS around the corner and RACES for her 
      mom s home.  Grace sees Moretti s Maserati -- with its 
       MORETTI  plates -- parked across from the house and 
      SCREECHES to a stop right behind it.

      Grace flies out of her truck and up to the front door.  Then, 
      just before she s about to enter, she reconsiders.  

      Careful not to be seen, Grace peeks inside a window and sees 
      a pacing Moretti, gun in hand, and her mom, terrified, with a 
      gash on her forehead, seated on the sofa.  

      Changing her course of action, Grace runs back to her truck.  
      To our surprise, she throws her truck into reverse and BACKS 
      UP fast, shifts into DRIVE, and SLAMS INTO THE MASERATI S 
      REAR END with a loud CRUNCH!  The car alarm SCREAMS!  

      We realize that Grace is trying to draw Moretti out of the 
      house and away from her mother.  It works.  Moretti races out 
      with HIS GUN in his hand!  Eyes his car, furious --

                                    MORETTI
                    You crazy bitch -- !

      Grace CRANKS her wheel and floors it, SPEEDING down the 
      street.  She glances into her REAR VIEW to see Moretti as he 
      jumps into his car, starts the engine and RACES AFTER HER.

      As Grace HOOKS HER TRUCK AROUND THE CORNER... 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      GRACE S PICKUP ZIPS down a neighborhood street, whipping past 
      brick row houses, shops, and a stone church.  BEHIND HER, 
      Moretti S MASERATI ROARS, STARTING TO GAIN as...

      Grace SPOTS AN INTERSECTION coming up ahead... closer... 
      closer... until, at the last minute, she makes a decision.  
      She WRENCHES the wheel hard, SKIDDING around it onto...


      ... where Grace s truck SPRINTS down a now-familiar street.  
      UP AHEAD is Constantine s GATED DRIVEWAY.   

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      53.

      CONTINUED:

      Grace zeroes in on the pavement, then HOOKS her truck to a 
      stop by an INTERCOM.  She THUMBS the call button, urgent.

                                  GRACE
                      Constantine!  Constantine!!

                                    CONSTANTINE (ON INTERCOM)
                    Grace?

                                  GRACE
                    Let me in.  Please!

      With a CLICK the gate SWINGS OPEN.  Grace PUNCHES THE GAS, 
      driving her truck inside... but just as the gate begins to 
      close, Moretti slips in.  Shit! 


      Grace s truck SPEEDS up to the front door and stops hard.  
      Grace bursts out and hustles for Constantine s door -- right 
      as Constantine steps out of the house.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Grace?  What s wrong?

      Before she can answer, Moretti s car BLASTS up the driveway 
      and SKIDS TO A VIOLENT STOP by her truck.  Seconds later, 
      Moretti gets out with that .38 --

                                    MORETTI
                    Hold it, Grace -- 

      Grace freezes, unsure.  Constantine approaches...

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Easy, Tommy.  What s goin  on?

                                    MORETTI
                    No disrespect, but this is none of 
                    your business.  Me and Grace just 
                    need to talk -- 

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Maybe you better cool down first -- 

                                    MORETTI
                          (angry; menacing)
                    You had your time, Man.  Go back 
                    inside and -- 

      BAM!  The SHARP CRACK of a gunshot rips the air.  Moretti 
      DROPS like a rag doll.  And Grace whirls to see... 
      Constantine holding a gun in his hand.  WTF?

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      54.

      CONTINUED: (2)

      A beat as Grace tries to wrap her head around this, 
      Constantine orders --

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    You didn t see anything.  Go home.

                                  GRACE
                    But...

      Constantine speaks with an authority we have not yet seen --

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Go! 

      Grace nods, hurries back to her truck, and ROARS outta there.  
      OFF Constantine, standing over the dead body of Moretti... 

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Just as she left it, except now Moretti s car has been 
      replaced by THREE OTHER CARS in the driveway.

      Grace arrives in her pickup and gets out.  She notes the cars 
      -- and then Franco (Moretti s young lieutenant from the 
      track) who emerges from one of the cars and approaches.

                                  FRANCO
                    Yo, Doctor.  Good to see ya.  

      Oh, shit.  Grace, confused and scared, starts to backpedal 
      for her truck... when Alexander Constantine, himself, steps 
      out of the house.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Grace -- I m glad you re here.

      Grace turns and sees Constantine, looking fine.

                                  GRACE
                          (wary)
                    I got your page.    

      Grace eyes her truck; should she bolt?  But a smiling Franco 
      now stands between her and her truck.  

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Walk with me.

      Grace looks back to her truck, then to the man beside her.  
      How can she say no?  She starts walking with Constantine.  
      She takes a deep breath.  Trying to stay strong, she asks --

                                  GRACE
                    So... does Franco know you killed 
                    his boss?

                    Who do you think helped me get rid 
                    of the body?  
                          (off Grace s surprise)
                    Seems no one really liked Moretti.  
                    Truth be told, that s how I got 
                    Severino to roll.

                                  GRACE
                    Wait.  You got him to roll...?

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    I needed a way back in.  It turns 
                    out, I got more friends than you d

                          (off Grace, speechless)
                    Woulda worked --  til you showed up 
                    here and Moretti forced my hand.

                                  GRACE
                          (reeling)
                    So all that stuff about you being 
                    reformed?

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    The parole board ate it up.  

                                  GRACE
                    And that newspaper article, in the 
                    frame.  You said it was to remind 
                    you of the mistakes you made.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    The mistakes I made that got me 
                    caught.

      Grace shakes her head.  This is too much.  Then, a FOURTH CAR 
      drives up.  Gino, Moretti s guy from the chop shop, emerges 
      and embraces Franco.  He heads into the house, joining 
      several OTHERS.  Holy shit.  It s like watching a coup. 

                                    CONSTANTINE (CONT D)
                    Point is, I like you, you know 
                    that.  But you need to leave 
                    Chicago.

                                  GRACE
                    What?

                                    CONSTANTINE

                                    CONSTANTINE
                          (smiles; she s good)
                    Okay.  If you chose to stay, I ll 
                    cover you, best I can.  But your debt 
                    to Moretti, it would belong to me.  

      Constantine says this with a gravitas we haven t heard 
      before.  It s deep and scary.  Still, Grace doesn t back off.  

                                  GRACE
                    Lord Acton had another saying: Great 
                    men are almost always bad men.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    You saying I m a bad man?

                                  GRACE
                    I m saying -- we have a deal.  

      Grace extends a hand to Constantine; they shake.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    I ll be seeing you.
                          (beat)
                    And remember, you had a choice.

      As he turns and walks back to the house, HOLD ON Grace as she 
      watches Constantine and Franco welcome Gino.  She glances 
      over to the OPEN GARAGE, with an 80S-ERA WHITE CADILLAC 
      DEVILLE inside.  Something about it gives Grace pause.

                                  GRACE (V.O.)
                    You ask me, choice is a moving 
                    target.  Like what we choose to share 
                    and what we choose to keep secret.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      BAM!  The FLAT ECHO OF A GUNSHOT FADES.  Moments later, Young 
      Grace steps into view.  From a distance, she SEES the body in 
      the field.  She approaches it. 

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      60.

      CONTINUED:

                                  GRACE (V.O.) 
                    See, I didn t tell you something 
                    about my first dead body... He 
                    wasn t just any drunk.  

      She kneels beside the body and touches the dead man s jacket.  

                                  GRACE (V.O.)
                    He was my father. 

      ANGLE ON YOUNG Grace as she studies the man, his eyes open. 

                                  GRACE (V.O.)
                    And I wasn t just fascinated when I 
                    saw him, I was relieved.  Never 
                    again would he come home drunk...  

      As in the prior flashback, Grace closes the dead man s eyes --

                                  GRACE (V.O.)
                    Never again would he hurt my 
                    mother, or brother, or me....  

      Just then, Grace is startled when, in the distance, she HEARS 
      a car door slam.  Glancing down the way, she SEES A BRAND NEW 
      CADILLAC DEVILLE.  No way to make out who s inside... but it 
      looks a lot like the one we saw in Constantine s garage. 

                                  GRACE (V.O.)
                    Finding him dead.  It meant we were 
                    safe... 

      As the engine starts up, HOLD ON Young Grace.  As the CAMERA 
      NARROWS on the Illinois license plate:  XTL515 , we -- 

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      PRESENT DAY

      TIGHT on the license plate of the CADILLAC in Constantine s 
      Garage:  XTL515 .  PULL BACK as Grace watches Constantine and 
      the men disappear into the house.  

                                  GRACE (V.O.)
                    And for a while, I guess we were.  

      As the front door slams, we HOLD ON GRACE, feeling she s made 
      a deal with the Devil, who may also be her savior...      

                                                                          FADE OUT.
