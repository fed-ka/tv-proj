It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house,
several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit
between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated
valley.
TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an
overgrown paddock.
THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden.
TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line.
TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car.
FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling
front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The
others knit a large blanket.
TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.
A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading.
A MAN chops wood.
A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.
Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up
the driveway. She carries a small bag.
Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to
see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window
watching.
Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the
woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins
to run.
SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.
Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently
yells out: "MARCY MAY"
The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.
For a moment everything is quiet.
3.
Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into
the woods, chasing after Martha.
The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She
hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man
and two women are chasing her.
Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps
running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.
Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see
the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and
begin their descent.
Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her
pass by.
Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits.
She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms
from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.
LUCY
Hello. Hello?
MARTHA
Hi!
LUCY
Martha?
MARTHA
Yeah.
LUCY
Oh my god! Where are you?
MARTHA
I'm not sure. Upstate I think.
LUCY
You're in New York?
MARTHA
I think. Yeah.
LUCY
When did you get back?
4.
Martha doesn't know what to say, she bursts into tears.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Martha? What's wrong? What's happened?
MARTHA
I don't know. I should go back.
LUCY
Go back where?
MARTHA
I have to go, I can't stay gone.
LUCY
No, no, no. Don't go. What are you
talking about?
MARTHA
Sorry for calling.
LUCY
Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not
hang up.
(BEAT)
Do you want me to come get you?
MARTHA
I can't wait that long.
LUCY
What do you mean? Tell me where you are
and I'll come right now.
MARTHA
It's okay, you don't have to-
LUCY
I want to see you Martha. Please.
Martha thinks for a moment.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Martha!
Martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at
an empty bus stop. She does not look well. She turns and
vomits behind the bench.
Martha hides between two parked buses. She watches a
BLACK BMW pull into the parking lot. LUCY, a well dressed
woman in her early 30's, gets out of the car. Martha
walks towards Lucy. Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha.
Martha sits cross legged on a sun bed looking out to the
lake. Ted naps while Lucy sun bathes reading THE MOTHER
OF ALL BABY BOOKS.
MARTHA
Where are we?
LUCY
Connecticut.
MARTHA
How far are we?
LUCY
From what?
MARTHA
Yesterday.
Lucy is confused. She tries to make sense of the
question.
LUCY
You mean where I picked you up?
14.
Martha nods.
LUCY (CONT'D)
About 3 hours.
(BEAT)
Why?
MARTHA
Just wondered.
Lucy goes back to reading. Martha lies down and stares at
the sky. A light banging sound starts to echo over the
lake.
THE SOUND IS THE SAME AS THE LAKE: A light breeze in the
trees and the water gently hitting the dock.
Patrick and two men build a fence.
CUT TO:
Martha lies in the open field smoking cigarettes with
ZOE, a girl in her early twenties.
Martha is younger, more energetic and confident. They are
laughing and talking when Zoe notices Patrick walking
towards them.
ZOE
Put out your cigarette.
MARTHA
(SMILING)
Why?
ZOE
Just do it.
They put out their cigarettes. Zoe buries them in the
grass. Patrick approaches them.
MARTHA
Is that him?
ZOE
Yeah.
(CALLING OUT)
Hey!
15.
PATRICK
Is this Martha?
MARTHA
Hi!
PATRICK
How're you doing?
Patrick crouches down over Zoe but smiles at Martha.
MARTHA
Great. You've got a really nice place
here.
PATRICK
It's as much yours as it is mine.
He glances at her legs, then back up to her face. He
turns his attention to Zoe.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
I thought you quit?
ZOE
I did.
PATRICK
It's disgusting.
ZOE
I know. I'm sorry.
PATRICK
Don't apologize to me, it's your body.
Patrick gestures towards Martha.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Look after this girl properly Zoe, she
deserves some real care for once in her
life.
ZOE
I will.
MARTHA
She's been great, everyone's been great.
PATRICK
Good.
(BEAT)
You look like a Marcy May.
16.
MARTHA
Marcy was my grandmothers name.
PATRICK
Well, there you go.
He continues to walk through the field. Zoe and Martha
recline into the grass and continue talking.
TED (O.S.)
I'm going for a dip. Anyone want to join?
MARTHA
Sure.
Martha stands up and brushes herself off.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
You coming?
Martha turns to Zoe but Lucy is there instead, lying on
the sun bed, lost in her book. Lucy does not answer.
Ted runs down the dock and dives into the water. Martha
follows. Ted looks back to see Martha stand at the end of
the dock, take off her clothes and dive in naked.
Martha swims, lost in her own world.
Lucy notices Martha, grabs a towel, and walks down to the
end of the dock. Ted swims back and gets out.
TED
(SMIRKING)
Brilliant choice of swim wear.
Lucy is not amused. Ted walks away laughing. He turns to
sneak one more glimpse of Martha.
LUCY
Martha! What are you doing?
MARTHA
What?
LUCY
Would you put some clothes on, you can't
swim naked.
17.
MARTHA
Why?
LUCY
You just can't. There are kids around and
people come by.
MARTHA
So?
LUCY
So you can't. We don't, just don't. I
have a bathing suit you can borrow.
Martha gets out of the water. Lucy wraps the towel around
her and walks away. Martha dries off. She feels
embarrassed.
An OLD BROWN CAR pulls out of the driveway.
Martha sweeps the front porch. She notices the car pull
away.
MAX, A young man in his early twenties, comes outside and
sits down next to her. Max is warm, nice, and care free.
He's not very bright but he is a good time to be around.
MAX
Hey Marcy.
19.
MARTHA
Hey Max.
(BEAT)
Where do they go at night?
MAX
I don't know, I never get invited.
He jumps over the banister and reaches under the porch.
MAX (CONT'D)
You want to have a drink with me?
He pulls out a little flask and shakes it. A mischievous
smile grows on his face.
MAX (CONT'D)
They won't be back for a few hours.
MARTHA
I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for
awhile, I think it's a good idea for me.
MAX
Alright.
MARTHA
Patrick'll know.
MAX
It's cool, I'm good at hiding it.
Martha, Watts, Max, Zoe and a few others sit around and
listen to two men play guitar. Everyone is talking and
laughing and having a nice time.
Patrick approaches. He observes everyone for a moment, he
seems agitated. He speaks above everyone and above the
music.
PATRICK
How's everything going so far Marcy May?
MARTHA
Good.
The guys stop playing music.
21.
PATRICK
You like it here?
MARTHA
Yeah, it's really nice.
PATRICK
I want you to feel at home.
MARTHA
I do. Thanks.
PATRICK
People have abandoned you your whole
life. I don't blame you for not trusting
anyone.
MARTHA
What?
PATRICK
If you ever want to have a meaningful
relationship, you need to let your guard
down.
Martha is embarrassed and feels on the spot.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
It's not your fault, but it's there. If
you feel safe here, and I think you do,
let us in. We just want to help you.
ZOE
Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome.
PATRICK
If you're going to live here then really
be apart of things.
It is hot, sunny, and peaceful. Martha sits cross legged.
Ted reads the newspaper. Lucy sunbathes. Martha notices
they wear wedding rings.
MARTHA
(SURPRISED)
You're married?
LUCY
Yeah.
23.
MARTHA
When?
LUCY
Earlier this year, in the spring.
There is an awkward silence.
LUCY (CONT'D)
I tried to get in touch with you,
apparently you got rid of your cell
phone?
MARTHA
I lost it.
LUCY
You never got a new one?
MARTHA
I got used to not having it.
TED
Cocktail anyone?
LUCY
No thanks.
TED
Martha?
Martha shakes her head. Ted walks to the back of the
boat. Martha has to stand up to let him pass through the
narrow walk way. He brushes up against her as he squeezes
by.
MARTHA
Was it a big wedding?
LUCY
No, about forty people. Mostly his
family.
MARTHA
(SMIRKING)
Did Aunt Dora come?
LUCY
Yeah.
MARTHA
Did she smoke like chimney and complain
about everything.
24.
Ted laughs.
LUCY
She's not that bad.
MARTHA
You never had to live with her.
TED
You lived with Dora?
MARTHA
She lived with me after mom died.
TED
(TO LUCY)
Where were you?
LUCY
College.
Lucy picks up her Polaroid camera and frames up Martha.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're
okay.
MARTHA
(SMILING)
She hates me.
LUCY
She doesn't hate you.
(BEAT)
Look at me.
MARTHA
I hate her.
Martha notices the camera and quickly turns away.
LUCY
Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.
(LUCY FOCUSES)
Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying.
Martha cracks a smile. Lucy snaps the shot.
LUCY (CONT'D)
There you go!
Lucy hands Martha the Polaroid, she shakes it.
25.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Don't shake it, that's a myth.
Martha looks deep in thought, she continues to shake the
Polaroid.
MARTHA
Is it true married people don't fuck?
LUCY
What? No!
Ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at
Martha's ass as he passes. Martha is embarrassed. She
stares at the Polaroid.
Martha wears Lucy's dress. Ted, Lucy and Martha sit
around the table eating dinner.
Ted picks at the food.
LUCY
It's no good?
TED
It's good, it's just, a bit dry.
LUCY
It's not dry.
Martha laughs. Ted starts laughing. Lucy tries it again.
LUCY (CONT'D)
It just needs a little salt. What are you
laughing about I cooked for you your
whole life.
MARTHA
You microwaved chicken nuggets and
fish sticks.
Ted and Martha continue to laugh. Lucy gets up from the
table. She comes back with salt and dumps it on the food.
The group sits around listening to Max finish playing a
song. Everyone claps for him. Patrick, who sits in the back,
stands up and walks up to the stage. Everyone gets excited.
He tunes his guitar.
PATRICK
This one's called Marcy's song.
29.
Martha sits in the back listening. Everyone turns around
to look at her. She watches on as Patrick begins to play.
The song is a beautiful, intense and haunting folk song.
The whole group is entranced. Martha is mesmerized by
him.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Well she, she's just a picture.
Who lives on my wall
Well she, she's just a picture
And the reason, reason, reason it is so
small.
With a smile so inviting and a body so
tall, She, she's just a picture
Just a picture
THAT'S ALL
Well you stand there, stand there with
the nightshade,
Her dripping ripping down your hands
And you ask me, ask me about the
LIGHTNING
And the lady, lady, lady she understands
It's a dream for the future and the water
for the sands
And the strangeness is wandering Through
many callin' lands
Ted drives the boat with a beer in his hand. He moves
over and motions for Martha to take the wheel. Ted slowly
lets go and moves over so she can take the helm. They
brush up against each other. Martha is driving the boat.
She bounces up and down like an excited little girl.
Martha and Ted sit on the back of the boat. Ted gets a
beer out of the cooler.
TED
You want one?
Ted hands her a beer. She stares at the beer and
hesitates before taking a giant chug.
TED (CONT'D)
Beautiful day.
MARTHA
Yeah.
TED
How have things been with you and Lucy?
MARTHA
Fine.
31.
TED
Is it strange to spend time together?
MARTHA
No. Why?
TED
It's been a long time.
MARTHA
I don't know, it's normal I guess. She
hasn't changed much.
Martha takes a swig of her beer.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
Where is she?
TED
At the doctor.
MARTHA
Why?
TED
She's getting a check up.
(BEAT)
We're trying to have a baby.
Martha laughs to herself. The beer is affecting her.
TED (CONT'D)
What?
MARTHA
I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child.
TED
Why?
MARTHA
She wouldn't know what to do with it.
(BEAT)
Do you want a baby?
He gets up and opens two more beers.
TED
I want what Lucy wants.
(SMILING)
If she's happy, I'm happy.
He hands one to Martha and sits down again.
32.
MARTHA
(SMILING)
So you're unhappy!
Ted laughs.
TED
No. She's good. She's relieved to have
you back. You had her worried.
MARTHA
Why?
TED
You disappeared. You haven't called in
two years!
MARTHA
I lost track I guess.
TED
It's good to let people know where you
are Martha. People worry.
MARTHA
I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
TED
Well, she did.
There is another awkward silence. They both drink their
beer.
MARTHA
Can I go swimming?
TED
You don't need to ask.
Martha takes off her clothes. She is wearing a bikini
that Lucy gave her. It does not quite fit. The bathing
suit sags and top of her ass shows. Ted tries not to
look.
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER AS SHE DIVES UNDER WATER.
Martha brings her head above water and she is with a
group of people from the farm swimming in a swimming
hole.
33.
Martha watches as Watts jumps off the cliff into the water.
Everyone cheers him on. Patrick swims up behind Martha.
PATRICK
You jump yet?
MARTHA
No.
PATRICK
Go on.
Watts swims by and guides her out of the water.
Watts and Martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of a
rock face.
WATTS
You ready?
MARTHA
I can't.
WATTS
Sure you can.
Watts jumps. Martha stands alone at the top of the cliff
naked.
Everyone is looking up at her cheering her on. She builds up
the courage and jumps.
She hits the water, everything goes dark. The frame fills
with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. She
continues to swim, the camera follows her under water.
The darkness of the water makes the screen go black.
Lucy works in the garden. Martha walks over to help.
MARTHA
Do you ever hear things hitting the roof
at night?
LUCY
No. Maybe it's the pine cones.
(BEAT)
Where did you pick up gardening?
MARTHA
We had a garden where I lived?
LUCY
You're good.
MARTHA
I'm good at some things.
LUCY
I know you are.
They continue to work. Lucy builds up the courage.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Was he ever physical with you?
MARTHA
Who?
LUCY
Your boyfriend.
38.
MARTHA
What do you mean?
LUCY
Did he ever, hit you?
MARTHA
No.
LUCY
You had a bruised ear, and when you
called me you were hysterical.
Martha feels her ear.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Are you sure?
MARTHA
Yes.
LUCY
You can tell me.
MARTHA
He never hit me.
Beat.
LUCY
I wish you felt more comfortable talking
to me.
MARTHA
I do.
LUCY
So talk.
MARTHA
There's nothing to talk about. I had a
boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's
it, everything doesn't have to be a big
DEAL
Martha, Zoe and Katie work in the garden. Several men,
are lifting heavy rocks to make a stone wall.
Max is in the hay loft. Zoe is tucked around the corner
smoking a cigarette. Patrick catches her.
39.
He swats it out of her hand and scolds her. After a
moment he puts his forehead to her forehead and caresses
her head.
KATIE
(TO MARTHA)
Don't stare!
Zoe walks back to the garden.
MARTHA
You okay?
ZOE
Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so
weak.
MARTHA
You're not. You'll quit.
An OLD BROWN CAR pulls into the driveway. A YOUNG GIRL,
no more than fifteen years old gets out.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
Who's that?
KATIE
Her name's Sarah I think.
TWO WOMEN welcome SARAH and walk her into the house.
KATIE (CONT'D)
(TO MARTHA)
You should handle her.
MARTHA
You think?
KATIE
You're ready. Zoe can help but you'll be
great.
Martha walks with Sarah and Zoe across the courtyard and
out into the field towards the woods.
ZOE
(TO MARTHA)
I called my dad today to ask for money.
MARTHA
Does Patrick know?
ZOE
He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's
something we really need I'll call.
MARTHA
How was it?
45.
ZOE
Fine, they're not bad people.
MARTHA
Did he give you the money?
ZOE
Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.
MARTHA
Do you tell him you're not?
ZOE
No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess
he'd rather pay for it than think I'm
sucking dick for it.
SARAH
I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried
everything pretty much, except heroin.
ZOE
It's good to try everything at least
once. You find out who you are that way.
What about drinking, do you drink?
SARAH
I have, but I don't.
ZOE
Good, we don't drink. It just makes you
angry and less focused.
MARTHA
Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't
talk to our old families.
SARAH
I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter
how much he paid me.
Patrick and Watts walk out of the woods.
PATRICK
Hey.
MARTHA
Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet?
PATRICK
Sally, yeah.
CUT TO:
46.
Martha sits alone on the steps looking out onto the
water. She is deep in thought. Lucy walks down the stairs
and sits next to her.
MARTHA
Shouldn't we start cooking?
LUCY
I just made some potato salad. Ted's
cooking the fish.
MARTHA
I thought we were going to cook.
LUCY
We cooked last night.
MARTHA
Oh, yeah.
Martha is lost deep in thought.
MARTHA (CONT'D)
Do you ever have this thing where you
can't tell if something's a memory or if
it's something you've dreamed?
LUCY
Not really.
Beat.
LUCY (CONT'D)
Do you blame me for anything?
MARTHA
No.
(BEAT)
Like what?
49.
LUCY
I don't know.
(BEAT)
I'm just trying to figure out why we
stopped talking.
MARTHA
I didn't think about it.
LUCY
Really?
MARTHA
We were far apart.
LUCY
Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have
taken better care of you.
MARTHA
(MUMBLES)
The past doesn't matter.
LUCY
It does matter.
MARTHA
I took care of myself.
LUCY
I know you did. I think I could have done
more though.
MARTHA
Stop it.
LUCY
Be honest with me, you never think about
it?
MARTHA
No.
LUCY
You're not angry at me?
MARTHA
I know you don't think much of me but I
knew what I was doing then and I still
do.
50.
LUCY
No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm
just wondering if I should have come back
and kept you in school and helped you go
to college, you had so much potential.
MARTHA
I don't need your guidance, I never did.
I'm a teacher and a leader, you just
never let me be that but now I know I am,
I know who I am.
LUCY
Teacher and a leader? What are you
talking about? I always encouraged you to
do more, but you shut me out.
Martha doesn't respond she drifts off into deep thought.
LUCY (CONT'D)
MARTHA-
MARTHA
Just because we're sisters doesn't mean
we need to talk about everything that
comes into your head.
TED (O.S.)
(YELLING)
Dinner's ready.
Martha and the others are practicing pick pocketing.
Martha looks out into the feild to see Patrick talking
with Sarah. She is enamoured by him.
Zoe, Martha, Sarah and MAX are shooting bottles in the
woods.
MAX
Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how
to defend yourselves but I think you're
hopeless.
ZOE
I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows
how to load it.
MAX
Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday.
Zoe shoots and hits a bottle. He comes up behind Zoe,
wraps his arms around her, kisses her neck and gropes her
breasts. She moves his hands away. Sarah watches on.
MAX (CONT'D)
God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes
my willy hard.
Max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several
shots. He misses the bottles.
ZOE
What happened Doc? I should be teaching
you.
He loads another round, aims, shoots, and hits a bottle.
MARTHA
Alright, my turn.
Max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping
the gun.
54.
ZOE
(PLAYFUL)
Alright Max, was this just an excuse to
grope Marcy.
MAX
I'm teaching her how to shoot.
Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze.
Patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac. Martha
fires a few shots and misses.
PATRICK
Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about
someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel
how they made you feel in your stomach.
Take a deep breath, feel it all moving
out into your hands. Let it build. It's
transferring to the gun, building in the
gun. Now release.
She fires five powerful shots quickly, one shatters. A
smile grows on martha's face.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
(SMILING)
Feels good right?
Martha nods. Patrick opens a sac and lets 2 cats out.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Now try that.
MARTHA
What do you mean?
PATRICK
Shoot it.
MARTHA
They're living animals.
PATRICK
So, shoot Max then.
Patrick lifts Martha's hand so the gun is pointing at
Max. Max is frozen, he smiles awkwardly.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Go on!
Max is confused, he gets embarrassed.
55.
MAX
Fuck this.
PATRICK
Don't walk away from me Max.
Max stops. Martha drops the gun down to her waist.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
The cat has terminal cancer, it's in
excruciating pain.
MARTHA
I can't.
PATRICK
Max has no substance, he's just here to
free load and be around the girls but
you're a teacher and leader, you just
don't see it because no one let you
believe it before me. You're a leader a
Marcy, now prove it.
Martha is shook up. She does not fire the gun.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing
you think you used to love. You're
holding on to some false emotion that
stops you from doing what's right.
Zoe takes the gun out of Martha's hand. The gun goes off.
Martha and Max jump. Zoe shot the cat without blinking.
She hands the gun back to Martha.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
I could spend my life being selfish,
living alone, using this gift for me but
I've sacrificed myself to be what you all
need me to be. You need to trust me.
MARTHA
I trust you.
PATRICK
Then you shouldn't need me to explain
everything.
A gun shot goes off. They all look up. Max looks
mortified, he has shot the other cat.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
What did you do?
56.
MAX
You said it was sick.
PATRICK
One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one
it was!
Max tosses the gun and walks away.
A rock is hurled onto the roof of the house. THUMP. It
rolls down and off into the yard. Flood lights shine up
at a beautiful large country home.
THREE PEOPLE run through the yard, dashing through the
light and back into the shadows.
It is Martha, Watts, and Zoe, hurls another rock onto the
roof.
A man inside comes to the window.
Zoe picks up a rock and throws it onto the roof. The man
in the window walks towards his front door. Watts leads
Martha towards the house.
58.
The man in the house comes out of his front door, walks
around the side of his house and looks up to see what's
hitting the roof. He leaves the front door open. Watts
and Martha creep into the house.
Ted runs.
62.
Lucy sits on the steps overlooking the lake. She is
sneaking in a cigarette.
Martha stands below her bedroom window to see what's
hitting the roof at night. She turns and looks over to
the back road. The brown car is parked on the side road.
It is overcast. It looks like a storm is approaching.
Martha walks towards the car, her anger is building. As
she gets to the top of the road she picks up a rock and
throws it through the car window. Glass shatters
everywhere.
She picks up a loose shard of glass and scrapes a line on
the side of the car. She drops the glass and stares at
the mess for a moment before looking around to make sure
no one has seen her.
Martha walks down the stairs, she looks beautiful. She is
wearing a long white dress, Lucy has done her hair and
make up. She is cautious as she descends.
Guests have arrived. They are drinking cocktails and
talking in the house and on the back porch. Jazz plays
over speakers.
Martha walks outside. Lucy introduces her to some of her
friends. Martha looks like a zombie though, frozen at the
sight of so many strangers.
Martha continues to walk around the edge of the party
quietly observing everyone.
Something catches her eye.
She is studying the BARTENDER. She composes herself then
approaches him cautiously.
MARTHA
What's you name?
BARTENDER
I'm sorry?
64.
MARTHA
What's your name?
BARTENDER
Mike.
He puts out his hand to shake hers. She takes a half step
back and studies his face.
BARTENDER (CONT'D)
Can I get you something?
MARTHA
I used to like this.
She points at the tequila.
BARTENDER
Straight?
She stands there looking dazed. She doesn't respond. He
just pours it. He is confused by her.
MARTHA
I thought you weren't supposed to drink
Mike.
BARTENDER
I'm not drinking.
He hands her the tequila. She suddenly slaps it out of
his hand. The glass shatters on the ground.
MARTHA
You think you're so fucking smart.
Martha storms inside. Lucy follows her in.
LUCY
Hey, what happenind?
MARTHA
We all need to leave.
LUCY
What?
MARTHA
He's a fucking liar. We all need to
leave.
She points to the bartender.
65.
LUCY
What are you talking about?
Lucy lowers Martha's pointing hand and tries to move her
away.
MARTHA
We have to leave. We all have to leave. I
know him.
LUCY
Who?
LUCY (CONT'D)
What the fuck is wrong with you?
MARTHA
You don't want to live with this Lucy.
LUCY
Martha.
TED
Calm down.
Ted approaches and helps guide Martha into their bedroom.
Lucy turns around to check the party. People are starting
to notice. Lucy and Ted force Martha back into their
bedroom. He closes the door.
Men are moving vehicles into the garage. Women are
bringing the clothes inside off the clothes line. Martha
is helping with the garden. There is a sense of urgency
to close the farm.
Max is in the hayloft trying to close the loft door. He
slips and falls 30 feet to the ground. Martha rushes over
to him. He is in pain. Watts comes out of the barn.
MARTHA
We have to do something.
WATTS
He's fine. Right Max?
MAX
Yeah, I'm cool.
They help him up and he falls. He cant put pressure on
his leg and he seems to have a concussion.
MARTHA
Watts!
70.
WATTS
There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to
get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine.
Right?
MAX
Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop.
Everyone files into the basement except for Patrick,
Watts and Katie. They stand at the top of the stairs
talking.
Katie rings the dinner bell. Martha walks out of the
house holding a large pot of soup. She walks it through
the courtyard into the shed where everyone gathers to eat
dinner.
Everyone from the farm stops work and walks towards the
shed. It looks like more people are there than before,
there are several new faces in the crowd.
Martha walks through the house. All of the luggage is
packed and sitting by the front door.
Ted sits on the couch eating a sandwich and drinking a
beer.
79.
It is an overcast, unusually cold Labor Day. Lucy works
in the garden.
LUCY
Going swimming?
MARTHA
Yeah.
LUCY
It's a bit chilly.
MARTHA
I don't mind.
LUCY
I think we both said some things last
night that we didn't mean.
MARTHA
Yeah.
LUCY
We scheduled an appointment for you
tomorrow morning.
Martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices
footprints.
MARTHA
What's it like there?
LUCY
It looks nice.
Martha turns and walks down to the water.
LUCY (CONT'D)
We're heading back to the city in about
an hour. You'll be ready to go?
MARTHA
Yep.
Martha stands on the dock. She strips down to her
underwear and dives in.
80.
Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water
and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the
surface. A few seconds pass by and she is not coming up.
Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for
air.
She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice
homes that appear to be empty now. No one else is
swimming.
Martha sees a scruffy MAN sitting on a neighboring dock,
he seems familiar. He is in his mid twenties, his jeans
are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. His shirt
is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. He
looks directly at Martha. They make eye contact.
He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water,
puts on his shirt and just sits there.
Martha swims back to the house.
