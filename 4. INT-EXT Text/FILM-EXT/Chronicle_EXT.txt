Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the
street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon. Andrew
carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into
the passenger side of a car.
In the driver's seat is MATT Garrety, 17, with messy hair.
He's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the
reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school
intellectual.
MATT
I got you egg salad.
3.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Oh, yeah, thanks.
CUT.
They're driving.
MATT
So...Should I ask about the camera,
or-
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm filming things now. I'm
filming everything.
MATT
You're filming everything.
ANDREW (O.S.)
For my mom. I'm trying to get
custody of her from my dad. She's
getting worse, and he's
not...helping, and this way, in
case something goes down-
MATT
He gets violent or whatever-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Right, it'd be evidence.
MATT
Evidence. But you're not with him
right now, but you're filming this.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Well, yeah, to add context.
MATT
Context.
Andrew, you are...a weird
dude.
CUT.
MATT (CONT'D)
Did you ever read any Auguste
Comte?
ANDREW (O.S.)
What is that?
MATT
He's this philosopher I'm reading.
4.
ANDREW (O.S.)
For school?
MATT
He's just like- his whole thing is
about being positive and like,
taking up for yourself. You should
read him, maybe, it might make you
feel- you know, improve your
outlook.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Yeah, right.
Andrew's getting out of the car, but then ducks back in to
see Matt lighting a pipe.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Are you not coming in?
MATT
I'm gonna blaze a little first,
yeah?
ANDREW (O.S.)
You're going to miss first period-
Matt turns on the radio, loud.
ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Okay, okay.
A view from the bleachers as the soccer team practices. The
cheerleaders are practicing too. We cut: a different view,
lower.
ANDREW (O.S.)
This is where I eat lunch, out here
on the bleachers.
CUT.
LATER.
The camera's next to Andrew as he's eating, down on the
bench. A CHEERLEADER approaches.
CHEERLEADER
Hi.
ANDREW
Hey-
CHEERLEADER
Could you not videotape us, please?
It's really fucking creepy.
ANDREW
I wasn't, videotaping you, so much
as I was just-
CHEERLEADER
ANDREW
Just don't videotape-
-you know, filming what I do
during the-
CHEERLEADER
Don't videotape us, okay, or we'll
call security. We see you watching
us, we're not stupid, and it's
sketchy, so back off.
ANDREW
...okay.
CHEERLEADER
Is it on right now?
ANDREW
Yes.
CHEERLEADER
Turn it off.
Andrew turns off the camera.
7.
Andrew is filming as he walks along towards his house.
HOWARD (O.S.)
Hey, what you doing?
COSTLY (O.S.)
Hey nice camera bitch, gimme your
fuckin camera!
The camera pans up to reveal HOWARD and COSTLY, moron
hoodlums, along with several friends, over by a car on the
other side of the road, drinking forties.
HOWARD
Hey don't film me nigga, don't film
me.
COSTLY
Hey fuck off, you better run to
your house, bitch. Run to your
house and lock the door.
Andrew just stands there filming them. Howard hurls his
forty at Andrew, who doesn't move; it shatters very near to
him.
HOWARD
The fuck, fuck you faggot-
Howard quickly starts crossing the street, and Andrew turns
and runs back towards his house.
We're in Matt's car, driving on a dark dirt road, past an old
fence and rusted out farm equipment.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Are you sure it's here?
(beat)
Are you sure it's here, this all
looks closed-
MATT
It's here, calm down.
Listen.
We can faintly hear party music.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Oh yeah.
Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and
Andrew approach. We see Christmas lights strung up, and
there's clearly a party going on inside the barn. Kids are
milling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around.
MATT
Hey dude, don't follow me around
all night.
ANDREW (O.S.)
What?
MATT
Don't follow me around all night,
okay?
ANDREW (O.S.)
What am I supposed to do? I
thought you said you didn't want to
go alone-
10.
MATT
Talk to people?
Have a beer, I
don't know.
MONTAGED
FOOTAGE...
Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full
swing. Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking,
girls dancing sexy, guys joking around. Andrew is silent and
detached, just filming. He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16,
filming as well. They shout over the music.
CASEY
Hey, what are you filming for?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Oh, I don't- just filming.
CASEY
What?
I'm filming for my blog!
ANDREW (O.S.)
What?
CASEY
I have a video blog!
Why are you
filming?
Andrew simply backs away. More footage of the party.
AUSTIN, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere.
He's
clearly a little drunk.
AUSTIN
Hey, were you filming my
girlfriend? Yes or no, were you
filming my girlfriend?
ANDREW (O.S.)
No, I wasn't filming anyone
specific, just filming the party.
AUSTIN
(beat)
Okay, good, because I don't wanna
have to beat your ass.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Okay.
AUSTIN
Don't talk back to me. Don't get
smart, okay, I'm being nice here.
I'm being nice to you.
(MORE)
11.
AUSTIN (CONT'D)
(beat)
Say okay.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Okay-
AUSTIN
Cause I know you were filming my
girlfriend dancing. I should break
your fucking nose, you know that?
You know that, I should beat your
ass right now, but I'm trying to be
nice. Fuck you.
Austin abruptly throws his beer on Andrew, getting some on
the camera, and then spits on him. Andrew backs up, shocked,
lowering the camera.
Andrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the
lens of the camera, obstructing our view. Cut to a few
moments later; the camera now resting in his lap or on the
ground. We can see the barn, the party still going on.
After a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying.
STEVE (O.S.)
(loud, sudden)
Are you Andrew?
ANDREW (O.S.)
(startled)
What-
STEVE
Are you Andrew-with-the-camera?
(beat)
Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a
camera?
The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17,
approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing,
instantly likeable charisma.
He's a little drunk and giddy.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Dude, are you okay?
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm Andrew.
12.
STEVE
I'm Steve Kazinsky-
ANDREW (O.S.)
No, I know.
STEVE
...yeah?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Everybody knows who you are.
STEVE
Haha, yes, that is true. Listen,
come on, bring the camera.
ANDREW (O.S.)
What?
I don't-
STEVE
Come on.
Steve starts off, but Andrew hesitates.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't-
STEVE
Dude, come on, we found something.
Steve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass, toward
woods. It's rather dark.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Look, I don't think we're supposed
to-
STEVE
Is there a light on that?
On your
camera?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-
The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with
it. The light clicks on, illuminating Steve.
STEVE
Awesome.
CUT.
13.
They've reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the
remains of a fence. The light bounces around wildly.
ANDREW (O.S.)
What were you guys doing out here?
This is way out-
STEVE
Me and your cousin were blazing a
little.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Matt's out here?
STEVE
A bunch of people were out here,
but I think they've all gone back,
now, cause we're like, obsessed
with the thing.
ANDREW (O.S.)
The what?
CUT.
They're in the woods now, thick and dizzying. It's near
silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground.
Steve walks out ahead.
STEVE
Andrew Detmer, that's right.
I
remember you from homeroom,
Freshman year.
ANDREW (O.S.)
You remember that?
STEVE
Yeah, I have a memory for faces.
I'm gonna go into politics, which
is ironic because I'm soooo fucking
high right now- probably shouldn't
be letting you videotape this-
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm gonna be so rich when you're
president, you have no idea-
STEVE
Yeah, video footage of me luring
you into the woods for gay sex-
wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?
14.
MATT (O.S.)
Down here!
ANDREW (O.S.)
Matt?
The camera turns to reveal Matt, standing next to some kind
of craggy hole in the ground, at the base of a hill in the
woods. It's big, but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to
the camera. It looks like a big black spot.
STEVE
There we go. There it is.
CUT.
Andrew and Steve are now down with Matt by the hole. Andrew
is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness,
nervous.
STEVE (V.O.)
Where is everybody?
MATT
They all left.
ANDREW (O.S.)
We're not supposed to be out here.
STEVE
Is it still making the sound?
MATT
Yeah.
Did you tell Andrew?
STEVE
Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound-
MATT
Here, listen.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Guys-
STEVE
You've got to get really close to
hear it.
Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Guys, just don't like- don't push
me, or do anything like that-
15.
STEVE (O.S.)
You've got to go closer.
Like
almost inside it.
There's a beat.
MATT
We're not going to push you, we
just wanna get it on tape.
Another pause. Andrew moves towards the hole. Even with
Nightvision, it's completely dark in there. A beat.
STEVE (O.S.)
Do you hear it?
ANDREW (O.S.)
...It's like, whispering?
STEVE (O.S.)
Listen.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Singing?
MATT (O.S.)
STEVE (O.S.)
Ooooh shiiiiit-
That is so fucking creepy!
Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve.
ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
What is that?
STEVE
We didn't dig the hole, man.
MATT
Is the sound on the camera?
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't know, probably...I mean,
it's- it's kinda loud, right?
Matt looks to Steve.
STEVE
Do you guys wanna go in and have a
look, or what-
ANDREW (O.S.)
No, I don't- I mean, I won't do th-
STEVE
Hold your nose.
16.
Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into the
darkness.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Hey, wait-
STEVE (FROM THE DARK)
(faintly)
Come on!
MATT
Steve, come on, we don't know if
it's stable in there- It's probably
just the wind, we should-
Andrew abruptly goes into the cave.
MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Andrew, hey, come on!
Don't...shit.
The camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's
immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera.
It's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured
backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.
20.
MATT
Ready?
ANDREW (O.S.)
Rolling, yeah.
MATT
Okay, ball test.
Take one.
A baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing
Matt in the face; he drops like a rock.
MATT (CONT'D)
OW FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!
UNDERHAND!
Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can
hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.
STEVE
I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-
CUT.
Now it's Steve who stands on the yard.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Go.
A baseball comes in from off camera, slower. It comes down
towards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre,
impossible course correction, FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THE
FACE.
STEVE (CONT'D)
AGH!
HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!
Matt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice-
pack to his face. Again, we hear Andrew laughing.
MATT
WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-
CUT.
Andrew's out across the yard. He looks a little better; he's
gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is a
little better kept. He nods.
In flies the baseball. It abruptly stops in the air, a foot
and a half from Andrew's face. Steve and Matt let out a
cheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to show
a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and
Andrew.
21.
Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.
A trickle
of blood comes out of his nose.
ANDREW
Ah, shit.
CUT.
The camera's on a tripod up on the back porch, filming
Andrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle. They are playing
catch...no hands. The ball simply flies from guy to guy.
They drop it a few times in some cuts, but shout
encouragement, and are clearly having a good time.
Finally, they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast.
Matt looks
up.
MATT
Is-
Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew
rush to him, laughing.
STEVE
`In the- penis- the penis-
MATT
I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH
WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?
Matt, Andrew and Steve are eating lunch on the bleachers.
MATT
See last night, alone, I got my
whole bed off the ground. No
nosebleed.
STEVE
Yeah, I was doing weights, too.
26.
MATT
Weights, like-
STEVE
Free-weights, a barbell. I got up
to two hundred pounds before I
bled.
MATT
So it's, yeah, this is my theory-
it's like a vagina. Like it's
elastic, but if you stretch it too
far too quick it'll tear-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Ew-
MATT
And that's why we're getting
better. We're loosening up.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Couldn't that metaphor just be for
any muscle in the human body, like
working out or-
STEVE
No, I like braingina.
Braingina is
the shiiiiit.
Steve floats up a bunch of chips from his bag, and then rapid
fires them into his mouth.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I think it's time we took this out
of the backyard.
Matt and Steve look confused.
Matt and Steve are walking in, Andrew lagging behind filming.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Just stay back a little ways, yeah-
ANDREW (O.S.)
I got it.
Matt sits on the hood of a car.
He and Andrew are flinging
rocks with their powers.
MATT
That was a good one, you got that
one far.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Hey Matt.
(beat)
Do you like me?
MATT
What?
(beat)
Sure, yeah. I mean, I didn't,
always-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Why not?
MATT
Don't get mad, I mean, I like you
now, I like you a lot. You're
just, you're not super easy to talk
to. You've got a lot of-
29.
ANDREW (O.S.)
You're an asshole.
MATT
See, that's what I'm saying.
You're hostile, man.
ANDREW (O.S.)
(beat)
You know, you...If you hadn't
invited me to that party, none of
this would've happened.
MATT
Yeah.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Thanks.
Matt laughs.
Matt is sitting against the car with a wad of kleenex on his
nose, soaked with blood. Steve is leaning nearby, with a
brown paper napkin.
MATT
(beat)
My braingina is having like
a...face period.
STEVE
Yeah, you got some from your ears,
too. You've gotta start working it
out more, Matt.
MATT
Yeah man, in between my yoga.
ANDREW (O.S.)
You just need focus, Matt.
MATT
Ha.
ANDREW (O.S.)
You're lucky you got the kleenex,
I'm stuck with the taco bell
wrapper.
31.
Andrew holds out said wrapper in front of the camera.
MATT
That's like, at least twice as much
blood as I usually see on a taco
bell wrapper.
STEVE
Guys, guys. Look.
The camera moves around to show the woman returning to the
space where her car was parked. She stops, baffled, and
looks around. We hear the guys stifle laughter.
She notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it,
looking around. Andrew tries to get a better angle, and she
notices him, and stares.
STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Ignore us!
MATT (O.S.)
We're
(beat)
Mormons!
The woman stares a moment longer, and goes to her car.
The camera is being held loosely at Steve's side;
everything's upside-down, and we can't see anything, but can
hear the guys are clearly freaked out.
MATT (O.S.)
What the fuck did you do, man, what
the fuck-
ANDREW (O.S.)
I didn't mean to, I didn't-
33.
MATT (O.S.)
Fuck! SHIT! What's wrong with
you, look at this, fuck!
STEVE (O.S.)
Is he still in there? If he's in
there we have to get him out-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Guys, just calm down, I'm sorry,
okay-
STEVE (O.S.)
Fuck that, take your fucking
camera.
The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a
moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge;
the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet
below. We tilt up to see Steve taking off his jacket.
ANDREW (O.S.)
You don't have to- I mean I can-
Andrew raises out a hand, trying to telekinetically lift the
car. It rattles, and then Andrew groans in pain.
MATT
Andrew, just stop, just stop doing
things.
Steve dives off the side of the bridge.
Andrew films him for
a moment, swimming to the car.
Matt and Andrew pull up to see Steve dragging the REDNECK
ASSHOLE out of the water. They hurry out of the car.
CUT.
34.
Steve has the guy on the shore.
He's dazed and bleeding.
REDNECK ASSHOLE
-what happened, cause...I don't
know....my truck, my truck...
ANDREW (O.S.)
Is he okay?
Steve just stares directly at Andrew.
Andrew pans to reveal
Matt, on a cell phone.
MATT
Yes, just past White Crescent
bridge. Down by the- yes-
ANDREW (O.S.)
Is that the cops, are you calling
the cops?
MATT
(ignoring him)
Yeah, just come- no, I don't know.
I don't know, maybe internal
bleeding, or-
CUT.
Later. The cops and an ambulance have arrived. An officer
is talking to Matt, Steve and Andrew; the camera is held low.
LOCAL OFFICER
-looks like he'll be okay. Lucky
you guys were here. Is that on?
You can go ahead and turn that off.
The camera shuts off.
Matt looks FURIOUS, while Steve just looks uncomfortable and
freaked out. Matt's car is parked nearby.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't see how you guys can be so
angry-
MATT
You don't see how we can be angry?
You put a man in the hospital for
fucksakes. You put a man in the
hospital, you hurt somebody-
35.
ANDREW (O.S.)
He was being an asshole- he- I
didn't mean to-
MATT
Which part of that do you mean, do
you mean he was being an asshole,
or was it an accident? Was it an
accident, Andrew, cause you're the
strongest. Listen, with this, we
can't fuck around, ever.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Then what've we been doing, we've
been fucking around-
MATT
NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you
can't use it on people, or hurt
people like- Steve, help me out.
Steve seems lost for words.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I-
MATT
We need rules, okay. Rule #1, you
can't use it on living things.
Rule #2, you can't use it when
you're angry-
ANDREW (O.S.)
You can't just declare rules,
you're not-
MATT
I will fucking declare rules, okay?
If we keep going, and getting
stronger, we need rules. We need
rules.
(beat)
Damn it Andrew turn off the cam-
SNAP TO BLACK.
The house is big and nice, somewhat isolated.
Matt is
walking up ahead of Andrew to the door.
STEVE (O.S.)
Hey kids.
Matt stops, and both Matt and Andrew look around.
MATT
Steve?
Where are you?
CUT.
Steve is atop a power line pole, thirty feet in the air.
Andrew and Matt look up at him from the ground.
STEVE
Just try it, it's easy.
ANDREW (O.S.)
That doesn't look easy.
STEVE
You throw yourself at the ground.
You just fall, and catch yourself,
and then it's easy, I swear. Don't
try to jump or you'll flip
yourself.
CUT.
Matt hurls himself at the ground, WHAM. Cut, and again,
WHAM. Cut, and this time he flips himself BAM WHAM.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Let me try-
MATT
Yeah.
I'm done for now.
CUT.
Matt's now holding the camera, showing Andrew.
He checks the
street for cars.
MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
No cars, no cars, go.
38.
Andrew throws himself forward.
And stops, hanging in mid
air.
ANDREW
Whoaaaamygod...whoaaa...
Matt moves in for a closer look at floating Andrew, and gives
a glance up at Steve, who's cheering on the telephone pole.
MATT
HOLY SHIT DUDE! HOLY SHIT, DUDE,
HOLY SHIT! HOLY...SHIT DUDE, HOLY
SH-
CUT.
At first it's not clear what we're looking at, just blue sky.
Wind is very loud. The camera pans down to reveal we're FIVE
THOUSAND FEET IN THE AIR, in a clearing between two larger
cloudbanks.
The camera pans all the way down to show Andrew's dangling
feet, and below them, the impossibly far drop. We can hear
Andrew laugh.
CUT.
We can see Steve and Matt, nearby, now wearing winter-coats
and hats to keep warm. They're playing catch with a
football. Steve tosses it to Andrew, who actually goes into
a short dive to catch it. He looks up to see Steve and Matt
distantly cheering and waving their approval.
CUT.
Steve's holding the camera, filming Andrew attempting a few
fancy moves, but he's a clumsy flier. Matt does a few neater
tricks in some clips.
STEVE (O.S.)
Hey Matt, you're finally good at
something!
MATT
(loud)
What? The wind!
STEVE (O.S.)
I said you're an idiot!
Matt gives the thumbs up, and Steve laughs.
39.
MATT
It's about aerodynamics! If I put
a barrier just in front of me, I
can go way faster, cause it cuts
wind resistance!
STEVE (O.S.)
I can't hear a damn thing you're
saying!
MATT
Yeah!
Definitely!
CUT.
Steve and Matt are seen flying around, Steve further away,
near a large cloud bank. Matt is using his abilities to
shape cloud fluff into an M. There is a humming, rattling
sound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Guys, do you hear that?
Neither of the guys can hear him. Steve however stops in the
distance, looking around. He shouts something, inaudible.
ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
What?
I can't hear you!
Steve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging.
A BOEING 737 BLOWS OUT OF THE CLOUDBANK BEHIND STEVE.
He's
spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock.
Suddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the
camera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead.
The camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it
swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in
some tall grass. Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve
come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting
apart.
They lay there, breathing hard. Andrew sits up, coughing;
his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding. Steve suddenly leaps up.
STEVE
WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA
DIED, MAN! I ALMOST FUCKING DIED!
Steve grabs Andrew, shaking and hugging him.
40.
STEVE (CONT'D)
You saved
my life, dude! Andrew,
you saved
my fucking life! Is that-
Holy shit
is that the camera?! You
AND THE CAMERA!?
caught me
ANDREW
(exhausted)
Y- yeah-
STEVE
FUCKIN' AMAZING!
Matt touches down behind them, frantic.
MATT
What happened, are you-
STEVE
Ahhhhh!
Steve joy-tackles Matt to the ground.
MATT
(laughing)
What the hell, what the hell-
Andrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera.
CUT.
They're all standing in the field; Steve is still wigging
out.
STEVE
This is what people have wanted
forever, since like caveman times!
Do you understand, I mean do you-
jesus christ, I can't even-
Everything is fucking great! I CAN
FLY! Matt, listen, just say it!
MATT
...I can fly.
STEVE
Shout it out man!
MATT
I CAN FLY.
(realizes it feels good)
I CAN FLY!
Matt stands, shouting out at the field.
41.
MATT (CONT'D)
I CAN FUCKING FLY!
Andrew cheers from behind the camera, and Steve laughs.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I CAN FLY!
STEVE
FUCK.
YES.
HOLD ON BLACK
FOR A MOMENT.
Steve, Matt and Andrew are sitting around the pool outside of
Steve's house; empty beers are all around. All three are at
least tipsy.
Matt is up.
MATT
Yo Andrew, Andrew, gimme a beat.
ANDREW (O.S.)
(flatly)
No.
All three crack up.
MATT
That's cold, you're so cold! MY
OWN COUSIN! DJ Steve, dial me up-
Steve immediately starts beatboxing.
MATT (CONT'D)
Okay, yo, yeah, yo, you say you
wanna get high you ain't high as
me, you chillin' at yo mom's house
I'm at four thousand feet, cauuuse
I got those tight muscles, in my,
braingina, and you better believe

I don't need no turbines, ladies
fly first class on Garrety
airlines, my DJ is senior class,
president, straight outta Oregon,
gotta, represent, Matt Garrety
bitches, I'm the young Clark Kent.
42.
Steve and Andrew cheer and Matt takes a bow.
CUT.
The guys have broken open glowsticks, and Steve is filming as
Andrew and Matt manipulate snakes of the glowing fluid at
each other; it's beautiful.
CUT.
We cut between three sing alongs; "Shake That" by Nate Dogg
and Eminem (which Andrew protests too, as he doesn't know the
lyrics), "How You Remind Me" by Nickelback, and "Macho Man"
by The Village People.
Time has passed; maybe two weeks. It's early. The hole is
clearly caved in; the entire area is slumped downwards.
STEVE
Well that answers that.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I feel stupid now that I was scared
to come back.
MATT
Nah man, we were all- I mean, I
was, definitely, yeah.
A POLICE OFFICER appears.
POLICE OFFICER
Hey, you kids can't be here, okay?
You gotta move on out.
44.
MATT
What?
POLICE OFFICER
The ground is unstable, we're
cordoning the whole place off.
The guys are walking along. Andrew's holding the camera
loosely, not really caring, they're chatting, it's chill.
Matt gets a text.
MATT
Shit man, I got my mom's birthday,
I gotta go.
ANDREW
Say hi for me.
STEVE
Later dude.
Matt turns and casually rockets off into the sky.
STEVE (CONT'D)
What're you doing, where are you
going now?
ANDREW
Well I don't wanna go home yet.
You wanna go into the city?
STEVE
Ah, dude, it's rush hour.
ANDREW
So?
There's a beat, and then Steve laughs.
STEVE
Hell yeah, dude.
47.
They're 46 stories up, chillin' with milkshakes.
It's
fucking awesome. The city is beautiful.
STEVE
I wish I could bring Samantha up
here. She'd love this.
ANDREW (O.S.)
You still haven't told her?
STEVE
Nah, no way. She'd freak out.
CUT.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Mom's like, never home anymore. I
mean, you saw how my dad is, he's
just quiet. Sits around. I don't
know. And talking to him about it
is just pointless. He's got
nothing to say.
CUT.
ANDREW (O.S.)
And it's bad, because her pain gets
real bad, you know, and we can't
afford the good meds anymore. When
I was little it wasn't as bad, but
even then dad was still, you know,
the way he is. I don't know. I
don't know anymore. I don't know
how to feel.
CUT.
STEVE
It'll be fine, dude.
You'll figure
it out.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I hope so.
STEVE
Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter
break's coming up...You wanna do
the talent show with me? Get you
out there, you know, meet some new
people.
48.
ANDREW (O.S.)
No, I- I mean, no, that's not- I'm
really shy, and I don't have any
talents, or-
STEVE
Yes you do, you have a talent, you
have a talent.
ANDREW (O.S.)
(getting it)
...Oh, no way. No way-
It's a house party, raging. Steve's out on the porch with
his girlfriend SAMANTHA, 16, super hot, of course.
SAMANTHA
AAAH ANDREW!
Samantha runs down and embraces Andrew, knocking around the
camera.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Hi Matt!
MATT
Hi Samantha!
52.
SAMANTHA
Everybody's freaking out, you've
gotta come in here-
CUT.
We see shots of the house party, which is rocking. People
keep coming up to Andrew and telling him "That was awesome!"
Or "You fucking rock!" Andrew sheepishly acknowledges this.
Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing
is talking. This is MONICA, 16. She's a little drunk.
MONICA
Just fucking amazing. Magic is so
hot. Do you know, me and my mom,
in Vegas, went to a magic show, but
they didn't have anything like
that.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time
practicing-
MONICA
Do you not remember me, at all?
ANDREW (O.S.)
What?
MONICA
We took American History together.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Oooh, oh yeah, your hair was
different; it was blue, right?
MONICA
Yeah!
ANDREW (O.S.)
Monica, yeah-
MONICA
Yeah!
Hiiii!
CUT.
More shots of the party, of Monica talking. She entreats
Andrew to join her on a beer-pong team. A little tipsy,
Andrew agrees, setting down the camera on a couch. It lays
there. SOME GUY picks it up.
53.
SOME GUY
And now, you get a special treat,
I'm gonna film myself taking a
piss.
Matt snatches away the camera from him.
CUT.
Matt's walking around with the camera now he films people
dancing, talking, a people taking shots. Casey passes,
filming for her video blog. Matt's camera follows her, but
then goes back to Steve, who's cheering on Andrew and Monica,
who are of course dominating at beer-pong. But they take
shots anyway.
CUT.
STEVE
(drunk)
Matt, you have the camera yeah?
You have the camera, cause, don't
let him forget the camera, okay?
That's Andrew's camera.
MATT (O.S.)
Right on.
CUT.
Matt wanders the party; a stoner comes up.
STONER
Hey Matt, wanna blaze?
MATT (O.S.)
(beat)
No, I'm good. I'm just filming for
Andrew.
STONER
Andrew? He's upstairs in the
bedroom hooking up with that,
whatshername, hair girl.
MATT (O.S.)
Yeah, I'm a little drunk though.
Movies! Makin movies.
The stoner wanders off.
MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I'm making an experimental film.
54.
Matt turns the camera around to film himself.
MATT
Hey Andrew, hope you're seeing
this. Congratulations, sir. I'm
drunk, sorry. I was really worried
about you, like, before everything,
but I do feel like...
(beat)
I feel like this will get better
for you, man. I'm sorry I haven't
been there for you as much, you
know, when we were growing up,
because, I know you could be an
angry...be an angry dude. But I
love you, you know. Detmer-Garrety
extended family for liffffeeeeee.
(beat)
But listen when did I become the
one who's...who's out alone filming
myself, with the camera-
CASEY
Hey Matt.
The camera spins to reveal her, and then immediately drops to
Matt's side.
CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
What were you filming?
MATT (O.S.)
Just a thing, it's nothing like-
you know, Eye Of The Storm or
anything-
CASEY (O.S.)
You watch my blog?
MATT (O.S.)
I- yeah, a lot of people do. I've
actually been stalking you since
like, sophomore year- sorry, use of
the word stalking-
CASEY
Stockings are why I love Christmas.
You wanna get outta here? This
place is too loud for me.
55.
MATT
Yeah, I- YES- yeah, just gotta drop
off the cam-
Matt fumbles with the camera, turning it off.
BLACK SCREEN.
HOLD ON BLACK.
Andrew's just below the clouds, massive dark and ominous
above him. It's clearly not safe, rain and wind whipping his
body, lightning crackling inside the clouds. We can hear him
breathing hard.
He touches the bottom of a cloud, and gets a powerful
electric shock, forcing him to back off a tiny bit.
STEVE (O.S.)
HEY!
HEY ASSHOLE!
The camera turns, showing Steve, in a rainslicker, flying up
to meet Andrew.
ANDREW (O.S.)
Where's Matt?
STEVE
We have to get down from here right
now, Andrew! This isn't safe!
ANDREW (O.S.)
Where's Matt?
STEVE
Hung over, dude! You should be
too! Let's just-
ANDREW (O.S.)
No!
STEVE
What the fuck are you doing?
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm filming the storm, no one's
ever filmed a storm like this up
close bef-
STEVE
No, we're getting the fuck down,
now. This is fucking crazy, Andrew-
what- what happened to your face?
ANDREW (O.S.)
...My dad-
STEVE
Your dad fucking beat the shit out
you! Come on, we'll go to the
cops, let's get out of here. He
can't do that Andrew.
(MORE)
58.
STEVE (CONT'D)
This is not the way you handle it,
we'll go together, let's go, he
can't do that-
ANDREW (O.S.)
You don't give a shit, stop acting
like you care!
STEVE
I don't fucking care!?
You're my
best friend, idiot!
ANDREW
...What?
STEVE
I hang out with you and Matt
practically every fucking day! You
think I talk to anyone else about
my parents, or my feelings on shit,
are you that fucking insecure?
ANDREW
(long beat)
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh
god, I'm sorry-
STEVE
Dude, it's okay.
You just need
help, okay?
ANDREW
Yeah, yes, I don't know what I'm
doing-
STEVE
It'll be fine. But we've- ...Do
you hear that? I hear...singing.
A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHTNING STRIKES STEVE, BLASTING HIM OUT
OF THE SKY. The boom of thunder is deafening.
For a moment, all we can see is the stormscape, and then we
hear Andrew's rushed, panicked breathing.
DIGITAL
DISTORTION TO
BLACK.
It's a gray, dark day. A funeral is in progress; we're
filming from within the mourning party.
59.
A large picture of Steve is on a stand as the priest reads a
eulogy. Andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight and
confined, back to how they were when we first started.
We see Steve's mother and father. His mother is sobbing.
His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.
Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.
There's Samantha, crying uncontrollably. The camera passes
Matt...
Who's staring directly at us.
CUT.
Andrew walks along in the cemetary, filming tombstones.
MATT (O.S.)
What are you doing? Filming
graves, I don't get it.
The camera looks up at Matt.
He's keeping his distance.
MATT (CONT'D)
You're not returning my calls, why
aren't you returning my calls.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I've been busy.
MATT
No you haven't. Why aren't you
returning my calls. Turn off the
camera.
ANDREW (O.S.)
...No.
MATT
Turn off the camera.
Silence.
MATT (CONT'D)
I had a missed call from you, that
morning. And from Steve. I
listened to your voicemail. No
voicemail from Steve.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I was upset.
60.
MATT
(long beat)
How do you get struck by lightning
during a storm with no recorded
lightning strikes?
(waits, nothing)
You can look that up online, you
know, they keep track of it. I
looked it up. Zero. And they find
him out in a field, why would Steve
go out in the middle of a field
during a lightning storm?
The camera shifts a little.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't know-
MATT
What?
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't know-
MATT
No, no, you do know, you do know, I
think you do know.
ANDREW (O.S.)
I don't.
MATT
What happened, Andrew. Just stop,
stop lying to me, and tell me-
ANDREW (O.S.)
I'm not lying, I don't know what
happened-
MATT
I don't believe you, okay! I don't
believe you, I want you to- put the
fucking camera down.
ANDREW (O.S.)
No, why-
MATT
Because I want to talk to you. Put
it down- put it down, Andrew,
please- put it down, turn it off,
put the fucking-
61.
Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull
the camera away. He's suddenly shoved backwards; Matt
recovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew. The
camera hangs limply for a moment.
MATT (CONT'D)
(breaking down a little)
What did you do, Andrew? What am I
supposed to do? Who am I supposed
to tell, about this, man? Who do I
tell? I mean- I don't, I don't
know how I'm supposed to- Why won't
you just tell me what happened?
The camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketing
away from Matt.
Andrew sits alone on the bleachers. The cheerleaders are
practicing. The camera zooms in on Samantha. She sits alone
on the sidelines, watching numbly.
62.
The junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old
equipment. The camera sits awkwardly on the hood of a
wrecked car as Andrew fidgets to get it mounted. The area is
lit by lights from the main building, not too far away, but
you can tell he's not supposed to be in here.
CUT.
Andrew moves out in front of the camera. He telekinetically
pulls an old car forward, and lifts it easily. He moves it
left, moves it right, rolls it, sets it back down.
CUT.
Andrew is sitting, resting, tired.
He speaks directly to the
camera.
65.
ANDREW
I've been doing a lot of reading,
like you know, online, about
evolution, and the way it works,
and you know, natural selection.
The uh...
(cut)
The strongest animals will always
survive, and they're the ones that
you know, will prosper, or grow,
and survive, by feeding on the
smaller animals. And as humans we-
see, there's...uh-
(cut)
There's this thing called an Apex
Predator, and basically what that
is the most powerful predator in an
ecosystem. And humans, you know,
we're the apex predator, because
there's nothing that preys on us,
cause of weapons and stuff. But if
something could, I bet it would.
I...
(cut)
I mean, what I'm trying to say is,
a lion doesn't feel guilty when it
kills a gazelle. You don't feel
guilty when you squash a fly, you
know- I think that means
something. I think it really means
something.
CUT.
Andrew's back out with the car. He lifts it again, then
makes a quick "squeezing" motion. As he does this, the car
violently compresses down to the size of a basketball.
Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, which
collapses loudly.
Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as
he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which
bites him twice before he's able to fling it off.
The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand,
blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly.
Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off.
FROM CASEY'S CAMERA.
Everything is crisper, cleaner, brighter.
Higher resolution.
66.
Matt runs out ahead of the camera, and does a little shuck-
and-jive boxer dance.
CASEY (O.S.)
You ready?
MATT
I'm ready!
CASEY (O.S.)
Are you sure-
MATT
Let's do it! Woo!
Casey raises a paintball gun out ahead of the camera. She
fires. Matt's arm whips out, impossible fast. He holds up
the caught paintball.
CASEY (O.S.)
(awed)
Holy shit, Matt.
MATT
COME ON!
BRING IT ON!
Casey fires several more shots, Matt catches them
effortlessly, then hurls them all into the air. Mid-air,
they all pop, some of the paint landing on the camera and
Casey.
CASEY (O.S.)
(laughing, awed)
Matt, oh my god, oh my god!
69.
The camera is aimed at Steve's tombstone. There are still
flowers and memorials spread around. Some are rotting. The
camera moves around a little, then back to Steve's tombstone.
It's a run-down house in Andrew's neighborhood. The
streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in
yellow orange haze.
Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the
porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt. They clearly
haven't noticed Andrew, who's filming from out by the street.
He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the
house. It flies up and breaks a window. Costly, Howard and
the thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing as
they rapidly surround Andrew.
He doesn't react.
HOWARD
You are about to get fucking
stomped, you know that right? You
hear me son? Come to my house,
it's late, I don't see any fucking
police officers or some shit, I
don't know what you you think
you're doing throwing shit at my
house-
COSTLY
No, wait, what the fuck. What the
fuck are you dressed up like that
for. Are you high?
HOWARD
Lil' Andrew's straight up tripping
right now, I don't even know, I'ma
give your ass a wake up call-
Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in front
of the camera. He makes the "gun sign."
74.
HOWARD (CONT'D)
Oh you got a gat? I got a gat too
bitch-
Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants.
ANDREW (O.S.)
(firing the finger gun)
Bang.
Howard's body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loud
chorus of cracks, and then is FLUNG ASIDE. The thugs,
shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrew
telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending him
smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car.
Costly and the remaining thug start running, and the
remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him,
breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before he's
propelled face first into the ground, WHAM.
Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front of
Costly, who skids to a halt.
COSTLY
-no, no-
Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as
though under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving a
glistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he falls
across the curb.
We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but
other than that, the night is silent.
Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loose
money lift away from them, flying to him. There's a beat,
and then Andrew launches into the air.
Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on
one of the strut supports. The camera sits nearby, watching
the expressionless figure as it counts the money.
There's a beat and he hangs his head. We can hear muffled
noises of frustration from under the mask. Something that
sounds like a low, angry scream.
Very suddenly, he dives off the tower. A second later, the
camera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall.
75.
Andrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gas
station. He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towards
it. We transition to...
FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS.
Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio.
We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure
in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front
of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station
store.
Andrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells,
raising the shotgun.
Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires as
he's hit by a wave of energy. The shotgun blast goes wild,
striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage.
The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire
envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look
through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.
FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.
The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audio
from its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING.
It's been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who lays
motionless, burning.
76.
The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer is
horribly injured and screaming. His gas pump lays on the
ground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt.
Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces
himself to roll over. The fire on his body touches the fire
on the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump.
The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station.
The camera is spun violently out into the street-
VIOLENT
DISTORTION AND
CRASH TO BLACK.
FROM SECURE ROOM VIDEO FEED
Casey is chasing Matt across the lawn to her car, her voice
filling with panic, the camera being held offhanded now,
unimportant.
CASEY (O.S.)
Please don't leave, don't go-
We hear helicopters pass low overhead.
MATT
I have to go to the city.
CASEY (O.S.)
NO MATT PLEASE, PLEASE-
81.
MATT
I can't fly if there are all these
helicopters in the air, I just have
to drive there, or, listen, I have
to figure this out, Andrew's in
trouble. This is my fault.
CASEY (O.S.)
Andrew?
What are you talking ab-
Matt gets in the car and starts it.
Casey's breaking down,
openly crying now.
CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Matt please! MATT PLEASE, PLEASE
DON'T GO, I'M AFRAID! MATT I'M
SCARED, PLEASE!
The news chopper at first shows Casey's destroyed car laying
in the street, then pans back up to show Andrew, who's
floating hunched over, vomiting.
Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew
shoves him away. We're too far away to hear anything that's
said.
Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something. Matt, clearly
upset, replies. Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures
towards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but
Andrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the
destruction, and says something gently.
Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a
radical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerned;
he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at
Matt.
Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents.
Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something
to his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING HIM
LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.
Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper;
a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.
FROM MICHAEL ERNESTO'S CAMERA.
MICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from his
building, out on his roof. He watches in horror as the
helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of
frame.
Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.
MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
Oh, oh no, those people, man, those
people, oh god-
ERNESTO'S NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
Where's the other guy?
MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
He's fucking dead man, you saw- oh
shit oh shit-
Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded
bird, crashing into the roof. He vomits again, mostly bile;
everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in
pain and rolls over.
85.
He's bleeding badly from the nose and ears.
ANDREW
(agonized, crying)
No one's gonna help me...No one's
gonna help me now...
We get some shots from other people's cameras, video phones,
etc on the roof. Some people scream and try to run past
Andrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins,
which leads to more screaming.
Andrew stands shakily, looking directly at Michael Ernesto.
MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
Please man, please, I don't know
you man-
ANDREW
(mumbled)
What type of camera is that?
MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
(breaking down)
What? I don't know, I don't know
you man, I didn't- please okay,
please-
Andrew starts to raise an arm, when he's suddenly NAILED BY
MATT, blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour.
FROM BANK SECURITY CAMERA.
The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when MATT AND
ANDREW COME CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF.
FROM POLICE CAR DASHBOARD CAM.
The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to a
halt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT OF
THE BANK.
The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's not
impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guys
fighting for their lives. Matt gets the upperhand, decking
Andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop
car (our POV), lifts off.
WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns
and creates a telekinetic wall.
86.
FROM CALA PRENTI'S CAMERA.
CALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and
horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent
FLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes her
window, lights still flaring.
Her sister rushes up, looking out the window.
CALA (O.S.)
Sissy stay away from the window!
SISSY
What's happening what's happening-
CALA (O.S.)
They're right out there fighting!
They're-
Andrew and Matt come BLASTING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IN THE
KITCHEN OFF TO THE RIGHT, AND THEN OUT THROUGH THE CEILING.
FROM KPR-PORTLAND'S HELICAM.
The two boys come smashing up through the roof of the
apartment building. Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase.
Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at
street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees,
etc...
...But Matt's too good a flyer. What he doesn't block he
simply dips and weaves around. Andrew, clearly still woozy,
is distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out on
the asphalt.
CAMERA-MAN
They're down. One of them just
went down. Jesus christ.
Matt slowly lands nearby. The camera zooms in and hits them
both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and
look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.
We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matt's
face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth
and ears. He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly
covered with injuries. He looks like he's been in a car
wreck.
CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)
Oh shit, look at him.
87.
He approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently. Andrew
just shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to
stand, like a wounded dog.
Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading
and taking cover. One of them advances on Matt and Andrew,
gun raised. Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective,
pleading, raising his hands.
The cop is clearly panicked. He fires a shot.
Matt's arm
whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain,
holding his hand, which is gushing blood.
Andrew blasts the
Matt falls, screaming, and Andrew stands.
officers backwards.
CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)
OH SHIT!
Oh jesus christ!
Andrew approaches Matt, screaming and looking absolutely
terrifying. Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew
following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.
FROM KPR-PORTLAND'S LIVE-ON-THE-SCENE.
We're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely
everywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared
and looking for answers. A FIELD REPORTER fixes herself,
preparing to speak.
FIELD REPORTER
Are we...Okay, yeah, gimme- two,
one- We're live on the scene on
Parson Boulevard just south of the
center of downtown, and-
There's a rushing, screeching sound from around the corner.
The camera jerks, and moves towards the corner, the cameraman
man running to see what the sound is.
FIELD REPORTER (CONT'D)
Shawn, wait, you're unplugged.
Shawn-
Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying
past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging
at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man,
SLAMMING HIM INTO THE SIDE OF A SKYSCRAPER ON THE STREET.
Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against
buildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a
pinball until-
88.
FROM ABC 5'S HELICAM.
-Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a
massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing
downwards as though shot out of a cannon.
They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," a
trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves
building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to
the ground.
Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops
down at a broken, dead angle. Andrew lands nearly as badly,
lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and
screaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him.
FROM MICHAEL GRAVES' BUILDING EXTERIOR SECURITY CAMERA
The statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street.
Andrew writhes. Matt is motionless, blood pooling around
him, his back broken.
FROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS, HELICOPTER CAMERAS, HANDHELDS
FROM WINDOWS, EVERYTHING.
A bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the
front of the Michael Graves building and downed statue. Matt
and Andrew's bodies are painted by spotlights as police and
news helicopters hang overhead.
Police unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a
perimeter and pushing in. We're with them as they approach;
the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting
back and forth to each other.
Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots.
Andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the
bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and
he shakily raises both hands.
The all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are
telekinetically lifted into the air.
They hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their
limbs go rigid. We've seen this before.
Andrew screams, and then...It all happens in under two
seconds:
89.
Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of
Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard,
first through Andrew, then into the pavement.
Andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then
Matt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out,
striking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly.
All of the floating people drop, dazed.
Matt collapses.
After a moment, the police advance.
CUT TO BLACK.
FROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS.
The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear,
with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the
top and bottom of the screens.
Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room. At the far
end is a blackened out two way mirror. There's a camera on
the inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits
reflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable
expressions.
There is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out of
the chair. It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of
the Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical
attention.
To this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things,
massive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes
and cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back.
He can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own
blood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the
cameras.
He is barely coherent, screeching in agony.
MATT
Please...Help me. Help me, HELP ME,
please...I'm sorry! I'm so sorry,
I tried- help me, help me, I'm
dying, I'm dying. Stars- I see
stars, somebody- It hurts, please.
I'm- the blood...I tried...
Two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some
kind of radiation sensors. They go over to Matt, scanning
him.
90.
MATT (CONT'D)
Listen, help me, help me. I'm
dying, you have to help me, don't
just let me- PLEASE I'M SORRY! I'm
SORRY! HELP ME! I-
The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, his
eyes going wide.
MATT (CONT'D)
I can...I can hear the singing.
Matt entirely stops moving.
He lays there, not breathing,
completely still.
And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the
table and the chair. There are a series of grotesque popping
and snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and
writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.
The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we
realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.
His broken bones have already molded back into place. His
bruises are shrinking away to nothing.
The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its
frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking
military personnel, along with several men in civilian
clothes.
Matt stares at them.
They stare back at him.
4-STAR GENERAL
(terrified)
Listen...Son, you don't- I mean...
Matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off.
Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.
MATT
Would you please...turn off the
fucking cameras.
CUT TO BLACK.
HOLD ON BLACK
FOR A MOMENT.

FROM INTERNATIONAL NEWS BROADCASTS.
We see a variety of international reporters covering a
breaking story, but only see little clips of each, in
multiple languages. Behind them are various shots of a huge
hydroelectric dam in South Korea.
REPORTERS
-expected to burst at any moment-
City officials blame the
malfunctions on the terrorist
bombing that occurred at the dam's
control center last March.-
Botched evacuation has left
thousands of the Kyo-lee Valley's
residents trapped, with only one
major roadway leading in or out. A
roadway that has not been repaired
in over ten years- Again, the scale
here is just unprecedented. Our
hearts are with people of Kyo-Lee
tonight.
