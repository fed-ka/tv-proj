  CRIXUS sits chained to the wall, his back mostly healed from 
  the lashing he received (ep. 112). The cell door opens. A 
  GUARD brings in his meal of gruel and water, exits, locking 
  the door behind him. A beat. Crixus eats with his hands. 
  Slowly. Without interest or pleasure. Feeling only the 
  crushing loss of Naevia.

  REVEAL LUCRETIA

  watching unseen from the grate in the door. She takes him in 
  for a tortured beat, the sight of him a knife in her heart. 
  OFF Lucretia's pain as she turns away...



  Batiatus enters with Ashur, passing more of GLABER'S MEN 
  stationed at the huge DOUBLE DOORS of the entrance.

                        A day of shining glory.

  Ashur spots a dour Doctore waiting for Batiatus, Iovis 
  standing escort.

                        sweetened.

  Batiatus motions for Doctore to follow him. Iovis and Ashur 
  remain behind, watching them as they exit.

                      It is a burden that must be 
                        endured. I have no time for such 
                        petty concerns.

                        from the arena.

  Batiatus moves into the TROPHY ROOM. Doctore follows, 
  shocked.

                        would have my interests in blood 
                        and sand overseen by more attentive 
                        eyes. Those of someone who has 
                        forever proven himself loyal to the 
                        House of Batiatus...

  Doctore is stunned, realizing Batiatus is referring to him.

  Far from elated, Doctore slips into a troubled frown.

                        Barca was not granted freedom. 
                        Instead he met his end, at your 
                        hands.

  A tense beat. Batiatus locks eyes with Doctore.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The rumor is true. Yet reasoning 
                        absent from it. Barca was 
                        dispatched to deliver simple 
                        message to Ovidius. Instead he 
                        slaughtered the man and his entire 
                        fucking house, against command. I 
                        had no choice but to take his life, 
                        before the Magistrate discovered 
                        the deed and pulled us to ruin.

                        And Ashur? Did he aid you in this 
                        "choice"?

  Batiatus considers Doctore for a moment.

  Batiatus exits. OFF DOCTORE, absorbing his words...



  Spartacus, hands shackled, is led into Batiatus' office by 
  Iovis and Vesper. Batiatus waves them out.

                                        BATIATUS
                        That will be all.

  Iovis glowers, exiting with Vesper. Batiatus frowns.

                      It was your hand that forged my 
                        purpose.

  Batiatus misses the deeper meaning of that.

                        inside me. To know pale shadow of 
                        the love you felt for her...

  She kisses him. He hesitates, then responds, not with love 
  but with compassion for a woman who has never known a gentle 
  touch. As they roll over, SMASH TO --



  (ONE DAY BEFORE THE FIGHT.) Iovis unlocks Crixus from his 
  shackles and moves off with a sneer, revealing Doctore. 
  Crixus eyes him in surprise.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Dominus releases me?

                      It was Spartacus that moved his 
                        hand.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Spartacus?

                                          DOCTORE
                      He desires you at your best... when 
                        you face him sine missione.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The gods finally take note of my 
                        prayers.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

                        stand before him tomorrow, as the

                      If it were this very moment, the 
                        outcome would not sway. I made 
                        promise to Naevia. I will not die 
                        until freedom is won, and she is 
                        returned to my arms.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Delay talk of freedom, until there 
                        are ears that would welcome the 
                        sound.

                        I fear dominus shall forever be 
                        deaf to it. I must place faith in 
                        the demands of the crowd to move 
                        him.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Place faith to closer quarters. 
                        Batiatus releases me from bonds of 
                        servitude, to assume mantle of 
                        lanista.

  Crixus laughs, shocked and delighted. He grips arms with 
  Doctore in congratulations.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The title is well deserved.

  Aurelia pours wine for Batiatus. He eats an apple, cutting

                        man? Your father would have been 
                        proud.

                        The old bastard would have cracked

                        unworthy son.

                        Yet never believed in me. Would 
                        that he were alive to see the House 
                      of Batiatus soar beneath the 
                        flapping of my wings!

  He places a hand on Lucretia's belly, beaming.

  Lucretia forces a weak smile. Batiatus catches the doubt in 
  her eyes, darkens.

                        I fear your resolve grows soft.

                        unfortunate past, and fix them upon 
                        glorious future.

  Batiatus exits. OFF LUCRETIA, regret over betraying Crixus 
  gnawing at her despite her words...



  Aurelia knocks over a bowl of olives, quickly tries to herd 
  them. Ashur appears, lending hand.

                                        ASHUR
                        These celebrations can cause hands 
                      to tremble. Even the most practiced 
                        ones.

  Ashur takes an ornate tray, begins building a meal on it.

                                        ASHUR
                        See nerves calmed. You will do well 
                        here. I have a feeling of it.

  Ashur smiles warmly. Aurelia forces a polite, uncomfortable 
  smile, shifting attention to Ashur's food.

                        I would save prayer. I do not 
                        believe Spartacus will fall this 
                        day.

  Aurelia eyes him carefully.

                                          AURELIA
                        I have heard Crixus bested him in 
                        the arena once, at the Vulcanalia. 
                        What leads you to certainty against 
                        similar outcome?

                                        ASHUR
                        I am certain of many things within 
                        these walls.

  He gently brushes a stray lock of hair from her face.

  Aurelia turns as Mira appears with a basket of flowers.

                                          MIRA(cont'd)
                        You are needed in the square.

  Aurelia disengages from Ashur with an uncomfortable smile. 
  Ashur's eyes lick her as she exits with Mira before turning 
  back to Crixus' deadly meal. He fishes

  THE SMALL BLUE BOTTLE

  out from his robes and clandestinely pours a few drops into 
  an ornate cup. He plucks a FLOWER from the table arrangement 
  and lovingly places it on the tray as a final touch. OFF 
  ASHUR's dark smile...

  CLOSE ON the tray of food Ashur prepared for Crixus as a 
  Guard sets it down. WIDEN as he exits. A chained Crixus eyes 
  the indulgent meal with surprise. He picks up the FLOWER on 
  the tray, considers it for a moment before crushing it. He 
  takes the ornate cup of water, but before he can drink --

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        You betrayed me.

  Lucretia has appeared in the doorway.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Yet I have come to realize the 
                        fault is not your own. You cannot 
                      be blamed for being weak. All men 
                        are, when presented with wet

                        Naevia held no meaning to you.

  Not the answer she wanted to hear.

                        And what sounds would it conjure 
                        for our child?

  Her hand slips to her belly. Crixus eyes her in surprise.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                        You divine me as father? Not 
                        dominus?

                        swelling within me. I feel you, 
                        Crixus.

  Crixus takes that in, softening with a faint, sad smile.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I have often dreamt, in quiet 
                        moments, of having children.

  Lucretia barely holds back the sting of the rejection.

                        Then there is truly nothing left 
                        between us.

  She turns to leave. Crixus picks up his cup. She pauses, her 
  conscience seizing her.

                        Crixus --

  Crixus pauses, the damned cup hovering close to lip. A 
  frozen moment. Lucretia wrestles with her conscience -- and 
  subdues it.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I did not wish it to end this way.

  She turns and goes, knowing that she is condemning him to 
  death. Crixus watches her for a moment, then brings the 
  tainted cup to his lips. As he drinks --

                                                                    SMASH BACK TO:                                                                                    32.



  The Guests rush through the villa. Aemilia wanders in shock, 
  splattered in her husband's blood. Batiatus shoves past her 
  with Lucretia, Ilithyia, Domitia, Numerius and Aurelia.

  The glint of opportunity flashes in Ilithyia's eyes.

  Mira enters from the hall leading to the pantry. She watches 
  the panicked Guests swarm into the Atrium, her heart in her 
  throat. Batiatus attempts to calm them.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The situation is being attended! 
                        Still your hearts! In a moment my 
                        Guards will have --

  SCREAMS cut him off as Crixus and his men surge past Mira 
  into the villa. BLOOD SPLATTERS as they attack. Some with 
  swords, some with the chains still binding them. Guests 
  scramble to escape this new horror. Mira looks on, unable to 
  process the depth of the violence.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        They have lost mind!

  A frozen moment as Crixus locks eyes with Lucretia across 
  the room. Her heart seizes in her chest at the hatred 
  filling his eyes. A Guard attacks him, breaking the moment.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Come! Let us away!

  Batiatus hustles Numerius, Domitia, and Lucretia away. 
  Aurelia follows, terrified.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Where the fuck is Ilithyia?                                                                                    38.



  Screams echo. Ilithyia strides with Vesper, joining Glaber's 
  Men stationed at the double doors of the main entrance.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Seal the doors. Let no one beyond

                        I am the wife of the Legatus! Seal 
                        the fucking doors!

  Vesper swallows his doubt, nods to his men. Ilithyia sweeps 
  through the doors just as Aemilia and a wave of panicked, 
  bloodied ROMANS wash into the entryway.

                                          AEMILIA
                        Ilithyia!

  Vesper and the Men follow Ilithyia. RAMP TO SLOW MOTION as 
  Ilithyia looks back, a cool SMILE OF VENGEANCE bending her 
  lips. The doors close. Aemilia and the Romans slam into 
  them, screaming and pounding to be let out.

  RHASKOS AND THREE GLADIATORS,

  all drenched in blood, rush the trapped Romans from behind 
  with their swords raised.



  Ashur hustles in. SCREAMS and CLASHING SWORDS echo from the 
  barracks. He desperately searches for a place to hide or a

                      Do you recall what I said?

  Ashur whirls to find Doctore looming in the entrance. Twin 
  swords clutched in his hands.

                                          DOCTORE
                      In this very room? That if there 
                        were more to Barca's departure, you 
                        and I would share words.

                      Do not fucking speak. I have seen 
                        you ply tongue upon ear, whispering 
                        poison. Infecting the honor of this 
                        house.

                                        ASHUR
                        You would kill a defenseless man? 
                        Where is the fucking honor in that?

  Doctore considers that, tosses one of his swords to Ashur.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Let us see if you remember what I 
                        taught you. When you were yet a 
                        man.

  OFF ASHUR, his balls in his throat...

  Batiatus hustles through the carnage with Lucretia, Domitia, 
  Numerius, and Aurelia. A DYING GUARD half collapses into 
  Batiatus' arms as they round the corner.

  Domitia screams as a Gladiator rushes from the gloom. She 
  throws up an arm to protect herself and GETS IT HACKED OFF.

  The Gladiator finishes her off. Batiatus grabs the dead 
  Guard's sword and runs the Gladiator through the side. 
  Rhaskos appears at the entrance, battling a Guard. Batiatus 
  rips his sword from the Gladiator, intent on fighting to 
  save his house.

  Lucretia half drags Numerius away, the boy's eyes fixed on 
  his dead mother. Aurelia follows as they move through

  THE VILLA,

  weaving through bodies and avoiding Gladiators. They pause, 
  holding breath as they spot Spartacus slaughtering a Guard. 
  He snarls as the man falls, stalking away in search of his 
  prey. Numerius watches the blood-drenched champion with 
  horror.

                                        NUMERIUS
                      We are all of us dead.

  Aurelia hesitates, something dark passing just beneath her

  Ashur crashes to the floor, his robes slashed and bleeding. 
  Doctore looms over him.

                        You think this will cause 
                        difference? Even if life fades, my 
                        hand shall yet be felt. It plotted 
                        the death of Barca. Saw the 
                        Magistrate's end. Even helped force 
                        Glaber to patronage. Every beam, 
                        every stone of this fucking house

                      My treachery?

  Ashur rises, tears welling in his eyes.

                      My fucking treachery?! When did you 
                        stand forth for Ashur? When did any 
                      of you greet me short of mockery 
                        and scorn, you fucking cunts!

  Ashur attacks. Doctore counters.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You received... what was deserved!

  Doctore slashes Ashur. The sword tumbles from his hand. He 
  sags, knowing his end has come. He laughs sadly, his eyes 
  filled with regret.

                                        ASHUR
                        Would that this were the arena.

                        Send me on my way, then.

  Ashur drops to his knees, tears in his eyes.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                      As you would a Gladiator. Please, 
                        Doctore. A parting kindness...

  CONTINUED:

  Doctore hesitates, then turns his sword to rear back to 
  plunge it into Ashur's breast. Ashur uses the moment to grab 
  a fallen OIL SCRAPER and STAB IT INTO DOCTORE'S LEG. Doctore 
  grunts in pain, his sword

  SLICING ASHUR DEEP ACROSS THE FACE

  as the villain scurries back and flees for his life. Doctore 
  grits his teeth, pulling the scraper from his leg in a gout 
  of blood. MURDER flashes in his eyes.



  Doctore stalks through the corridors, passing the bodies of 
  GUARDS and GLADIATORS.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Ashur!

  As he moves off, REVEAL ASHUR hiding beneath a pile of blood 
  soaked bodies. He watches Doctore go, his face twisting with 
  hatred. OFF the cowardly escape...

  CLOSE ON A DEAD ROMAN WOMAN'S FACE, dress ripped open and 
  throat slit, half sprawled across the bed. WIDEN as Lucretia 
  enters. More BODIES litter the floor. Blood stains the 
  walls. Lucretia whispers into the gloom.

  Lucretia freezes as Crixus emerges from the shadows behind 
  her. Drenched in blood. Weak from poison. Sword in hand.

                                        CRIXUS

  Crixus searches her eyes, knowing her all too well.

  Crixus rams his sword into her stomach (below frame). She 
  stiffens in shock, blood trickling from her mouth.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I would rather it dead, than suckle 
                      at your breast.

  He rips the blade out and turns to go. OFF LUCRETIA as she 
  raises a trembling, blood-soaked hand to her eyes in 
  horror...



  Aurelia enters with Numerius. He rushes past DEAD ROMANS, 
  his eyes desperately searching for a place to hide, tears 
  hot upon his young cheeks.

                                        NUMERIUS

                        That small, little voice. Did it

                        his life?

                        Varro?! He deserved to die! He was 
                        nothing!

  Aurelia takes Numerius in, dissecting his contempt, knowing 
  now that Spartacus told her the truth.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                        a mood? Did you know the father? 
                        The husband?

  She picks up the KNIFE Batiatus was using to eat his apple 
  in scene 13, tears cresting her cheeks. Numerius stiffens, 
  realizing who Aurelia is.

                                          AURELIA(cont'd)
                      He was not a perfect man. But he 
                        was mine.

  Numerius suddenly bolts for the door. She lunges and STABS 
  HIM IN THE NECK. He gurgles in shock, grabbing at the wound 
  as BLOOD sprays. Aurelia falls on him, repeatedly stabbing, 
  her tears mixing with the blood splattering her face.

                                          AURELIA(cont'd)

  She looks up to find Spartacus has entered. A specter of 
  death and blood.

                      It is done.

  She sees Numerius' body as if for the first time. She sobs, 
  lost and damaged. Spartacus holds his hand out to her.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Come.

  She hesitates, takes it. As she rises she suddenly stiffens 
  in terror, spotting something behind Spartacus. Spartacus 
  whirls just as a bloodied Guard attacks. Spartacus' arm is 
  sliced open, his weapon tumbling from his hand. The Guard 
  rears back for the death blow but

  A SWORD SHOOTS THROUGH HIS NECK,

  spraying Spartacus with blood. The Guard collapses, 
  revealing Doctore behind him. Spartacus nods his thanks, 
  retrieving his sword.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  He heads out. Doctore takes in Numerius and the dead Romans, 
  his soul churning.

  TRACK THROUGH the aftermath of the massacre. Romans and 
  Guards lay dead and dismembered. Mira comforts FRIGHTENED 
  HOUSE SLAVES, splattered with blood. Gladiators slit the 
  throats of those clinging to life.

  CRIXUS

  half collapses into a chair, still fighting the drug in his 
  system. He drinks from a cup of wine, his eyes finding

  AGRON

  entering from the ludus, bloodied and spent.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your brother?

  Agron shakes his head, unable to speak through his grief. A 
  solemn beat. Crixus hands him his cup of wine. A gesture of 
  respect. Agron drinks. A commotion pulls their attention to

  BATIATUS

  as he crashes in across the room, using his sword to fend 
  off Rhaskos and a few other Gladiators taunting him.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

                                        BATIATUS
                        I am your dominus! I will see your 
                        fucking hearts for this!

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        Quintus...

  Batiatus freezes. Lucretia drifts through the carnage, pale 
  and near death, her hand to her blood drenched stomach. 
  Crixus watches without passion as she collapses to the 
  floor.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Lucretia!

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        What would you do?

  Mira's heart catches as Spartacus appears, moving between 
  Batiatus and Lucretia. Rhaskos and the others respectfully 
  back away.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      To hold your wife again? To feel 
                        the warmth of her skin? The taste 
                      of her lips? How many men would you 
                        kill? A hundred? A thousand?
                                  a beat)(
                        There stands but one, between you 
                        and her.

  Batiatus screams, attacking. Spartacus counters.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                      Go to her. Tell her the gods 
                        themselves will not keep you apart. 
                        Lie. As you lied to me of my wife.

  The shock of what this is about slams into Batiatus. He 
  marshals his courage and attacks. Spartacus systematically 
  slices him to pieces, careful to avoid the killing blow. 
  Wishing to extend the moment.

  LUCRETIA

  watches from the floor as her husband cries out in pain, his 
  wounds weeping blood. Batiatus trembles, tears spilling 
  across his cheeks as he scans his men for mercy. His eyes 
  fall on Doctore, entering with a shell-shocked Aurelia.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Oenomaus...


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  A frozen beat. Doctore turns his eyes, unable to help -- or 
  bear witness to his end. Batiatus' fear turns to rage as he 
  screams at Spartacus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You were nothing before me! I gave 
                        you the fucking heavens! I gave you 
                        means to accept your fate!

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And now you are destroyed by it.

  Batiatus snarls as he attacks. Spartacus counters, spinning 
  around and

  HACKING OPEN BATIATUS' THROAT

  in a spray of blood. The sword falls from Batiatus' hand. He 
  turns, takes a few steps towards Lucretia before collapsing 
  to his knees. He locks eyes with her, face filled with 
  longing and regret. The life drains from his face as he 
  collapses at the foot of his statue, dead. Tears fall from 
  Lucretia's eyes, before they too are stilled.

  HIGH SHOT

  as Batiatus' blood spreads across the floor to merge with 
  Lucretia's. Husband and wife, forever bound in death.

  SPARTACUS

  turns from his revenge to survey the Gladiators and House 
  Slaves. The wounded and the frightened. His people.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        I have done this thing... because 
                      it was just. Because blood demands 
                        blood. We have lived...
                                to Crixus)(

                        masters for too long. I would not 
                        have it so.
                                to Aurelia)(
                        I would not see the passing of a 
                        brother for reasons of sport. I 
                        would not bear another heart ripped 
                        from chest, nor breath forfeit 
                        without cause.
                                to Doctore)(
                        I know not all of you wished this. 
                        Yet it is done. It is done. Your 
                        lives are now your own. Forge your

                        together we shall see Rome tremble!

  The Gladiators ERUPT in response, as do most of the Slaves. 
  Agron practically froths at the mouth. Doctore takes this 
  in, uncertain. Crixus rises, gaining strength as he adds his 
  own voice to the roar of freedom. PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS, his 
  eyes burning with violent determination...
