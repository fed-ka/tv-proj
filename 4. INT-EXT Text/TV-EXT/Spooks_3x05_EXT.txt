                                  PSYCHOLOGIST (V.O.)
                    Thanks for giving up your Saturday 
                    mornings to be here.  Believe me, 

                    it won't be the last time in this 
                    job.

      Danny leaves the range with Colin.

                    That's the thing about guns.  You 
                    can't train for the real thing.  
                    I've got friends in the army, SO19, 
                    they all tell me that.  

                                  DANNY
                    How'd they all cope with it?

                    They just changed a little.  As 
                    people.  Not surprising really.  
                    You know, they've seen a bullet 
                    they've fired hit another living, 
                    breathing person.  Maybe even 
                    killed them.  Once you've seen 
                    that, can you ever look at anything 
                    with the same eyes?  There's no

2020

      A little windswept and secretive up here.  Sam arrives.  Both 
      seem a little awkward.  What the hell is this, an affair?  

                                  SAM
                    I don't like this one bit.

                                  HARRY
                    Yes you do, and it's precisely the 
                    reason I asked you to look into 
                    Ruth for me.

      Harry retrieves a small hipflask from behind a small grey 
      telecoms box.  Offers it to Sam, who declines.  He swigs.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    For emergencies only.
                          (beat)
                    What did she tell you?


                                  SAM
                    I caught up with her in the 
                    Registry.  She's been reading 
                    Source Karl transcripts.  I get the 
                    feeling she's been doing it for a 
                    while.  I asked her about removing 
                    them from the building and she more 
                    or less confessed straight off the 
                    bat.

                                  HARRY
                    You didn't confront her did you?

                                  SAM
                    God no.  I was playing around.  
                    She's not got a clue we're onto 
                    her.

                                  HARRY
                    What's your assessment?
                                                                                              *

                                  SAM 
                    She's obsessed with him, that's 
                    all.  She reads them like it's the 
                    Archers or something.  Always 
                    desperate for the next installment.  
                    I think she's really fallen for 
                    him.  

                                  HARRY

                    Oh, Ruth.

      Sam flashes him a subtle look. Is this true feeling from 
      Harry?  Harry rises above it. 

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Keep watch for now.  Where is she 
                    tonight?

                      Loneliness is endemic in this job.    
                    And with that comes weakness.

                                  SAM
                    Well, I'm not planning on being 
                    lonely.

                                  HARRY
                    I'm sure you're not, Sam. 

      Her mobile goes - popular girl, social network, etc.

                    Would it be alright if I ... ?

      night and the whisky for company.

      WELCOME".  Inside the open doors, we see chairs being set up.

      Ruth, Malcolm.  Watching the London night unfold.  Ruth 
      clearly nervous as hell.  Malcolm, sensing this, pats her 
      hand.  

                                    MALCOLM
                    Don't worry sis.  You look lovely.

      Ruth is having trouble believing she's really going through 
      with this.  

                                  RUTH
                    This is stupid.  Stupid, stupid ...

                                    MALCOLM
                    Right now, Susan, all we're going 
                    to do is do some singing.

      Ruth nods.  Maybe it's okay.  

                                  RUTH
                    Singing.  Yes.  
                          (beat)
                    Thank you.  Giles.

                                                                                              *90A90A

      The fountains, the lights, the romance of the Capital.  It's

                                  JOHN 
                    It's a nice dress you have on.

                                  RUTH
                    It's quite old actually.

      I mean.

                                  RUTH (CONT'D)
                    But your suit is nice.  

                                  JOHN
                    My father's, actually, it's quite 
                    tight around the middle these 
                    days...

                                  RUTH
                    Oh ... I think you have ...

      Some lint?  A pigeon feather?

                                  RUTH (CONT'D)
                    ... on your shoulder, a feather or 
                    something ...

                                  JOHN
                    Do I ... where ... oh ... there ...

      A grotesquely awkward ballet ensues with Ruth trying to brush 
      the feather off John's shoulder and John recoiling from her 
      touch not for any other reason than he's shy.

      Ruth looks at him.  Stops walking.  This is it, right now, 
      the moment.  The moment reaches its zenith ... and passes.  
      Something about her just does not make the move ...

                                  RUTH 
                    It's so late.  I didn't realise ...

      The wrong thing to say, cos now he thinks you're looking for 
      an excuse and oh for God's sake Ruth.


                                  JOHN
                    Yes, gosh, look at that, we've been 
                    talking ...

                                  RUTH
                    A long time.

                                  JOHN
                    Well.  It's been lovely.

      We must do it again some time?  We must exchange numbers?

                                  JOHN
                    Goodbye.

      Too shy to kiss.  Thinking perhaps too rude to shake hands.  
      So the cowards' option - do nothing.

                                  RUTH
                    Goodbye.

      And they turn and part and in Ruth's face at that moment we 
      see that she knows she is always going to be alone.

                    If in your judgement she didn't 
                    need to be followed, that's fine.

                    There's some things you just have
