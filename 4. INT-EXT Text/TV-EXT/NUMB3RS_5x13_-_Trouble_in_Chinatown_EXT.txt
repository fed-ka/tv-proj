      PAN OFF ANOTHER DRAGON AND FIND --

      A busy street decorated for the Chinese New Year. People 
      passing by jump as SKATER BOYS shoot past them hurling 
      firecrackers. THE SKATER BOYS roll past...

      THREE YOUNG ASIAN WOMEN (20s) meandering toward Hop Louie s 
      Silk Dragon Restaurant, looking for someone, something.

      A SILVER VAN PULLS UP NEAR THE RESTAURANT and stops. The 
      women speak Mandarin Chinese.

                                  LILY
                    Noshi wei wo men lai de ma? (You here 
                    for us?)
                          (the driver nods)
                    Cho yong goi shi hong se de ba?  
                    (Supposed to be a red van?)

      The driver indicates get in. The third woman (KIM HSAIO) 
      seems suspicious -- something about the van, the driver. 

                                  KIM
                    Bu, wo goi bian zhu yi le.  (No, I 
                    changed my mind.)

      She starts to walk off. 

      The other two women see her and hesitate. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    2. 

      CONTINUED:11

      Suddenly the van door slides opens and two Asian men pull the 
      two girls into the vehicle.

      Our smart girl, Kim, sees the commotion and starts running. 
      She runs past a wall, unaware of --

      THE  MISSING WOMEN  POSTERS stuck to the bricks. (The posters 
      resemble those found around Manhattan after 9/11, hung by 
      families and friends. Except these missing are all Asian.) 

      SHE CROUCHES BEHIND A PARKED RED FORD FOCUS, takes a small 
      cell phone out of her pocket, and makes an urgent call 
      (Speaks English, American dialect).

      Bottle rockets go off in the night sky, firecrackers POP, the 
      noise covering much of what she says.

                                  KIM (cont'd)
                    Alice, you gotta get over here, this 
                    thing s going bad.

      She sees the silver van trolling the street, looking for her. 

      THE FORD FOCUS DRIVER RETURNS; he starts to pull out, 
      threatening to expose her.

      Kim scuttles behind the car next to it; a parked Explorer. As 
      the Focus pulls out, it taps the Explorer s bumper, tripping 
    its alarm system.

                                  KIM (cont'd)
                    I m in trouble here --

      THE EXPLORER S HEADLIGHTS FLASH. ITS HORN STARTS HONKING. 

                                  KIM (cont'd)
                    Sus --

      The rest of her dialogue is covered by a burst of fireworks 
      and the car alarm. 

      The Explorer gets the attention of the silver van, which 
      races at her, blocking her from our sight.

      Her muffled scream covered by a bottle-rocket as the silver 
      van with her now in it breezes right past --

      -- leaving her CELL PHONE lying, smashed, in the gutter.

      A BLACK CHARGER -- 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    3.

      parks in front of the Silk Dragon. 

      COLBY and DAVID step out of the car, barely noticing the 
      HONKING Explorer, it s one loud street.  They head for the 
      only open restaurant, The Silk Dragon.

                                  DAVID
                    Looks alright.  

                                  COLBY 
                    Looks open is what it looks -- I m 
                    starving.  

      A celebrant runs by waving sparklers and an Ox head banner.

                                  DAVID
                    Year of the Ox.  Chinese New Years 
                    makes ours look a little boring.

      They enter the restaurant.


      A small stakebed truck has jumped the curb, smashed into a 
      freeway retaining wall, its colorful contents spilled onto 
      the roadbed: festive bunting, Chinese New Year floats, a 
      gaudy cloth dragon (from the Teaser) among them. 

      The dead driver flops over the steering wheel.

      Colby joins Agent Chen talking to LAPD. Then, to Colby:

                                  CHEN
                    Seems LAPD was trying to pull him 
                    over for running a red.... it turned 
                    into a high-speed pursuit

                                  COLBY
                    Driver lost control in the turn.

                                  CHEN
                    Yeah, snapped his neck. 
                          (walks over to the float)
                    Come see what the dragon ate.

      Chen opens the dragon s belly seam revealing two of the 
      silver van victims from the teaser but now  glammed-up  in 
      makeup and long red dresses.  Call-girls  maybe, corpses 
      certainly. 

                                  CHEN (cont d)

                    Just like Kraft s drawing.

      Don, Colby, and Simon approach one car, the Swat team loads 
      up the follow-car. 

                                  SIMON KRAFT
                    Good guys to the rescue -- where s my

      A PARKED FORD EXPLORER. Crouched behind it: Charlie and Larry 
      in headphones. Charlie has a portable dat-deck, Larry has a 
      boom mic.  They slowly stand with raised hands.

                                    CHARLIE

      Chen and Nikki watch as Walter Yoon sets fire to several 
      paper objects -- a tiny house, fake money, a toy car -- all 
      in an outdoor oven with Harvey Yoon s framed picture nearby. 

                                  CHEN
                          (quietly)
                    In Chinese culture we burn symbolic 
                    objects to accompany the soul into 
                    the spirit world.

                                  CHEN
                    We try to cover all the bases.  Mr. 
                    Yoon s the spiritual director here.

      Walter stirs the flames and crosses to Chen and Nikki.

                                  WALTER YOON
                    My brother and I were not close. It s 
                    hard to honor someone so... complicated.

                                  NIKKI
                    Actually, Mr. Yoon, that s what we 
                    want to talk about. Were you aware of 
                    his involvement in criminal 
                      activities, specifically the sex 
                    trade?

                          (sadly nods)
                      I certainly suspected. But for good 
                    or ill he was my brother.

      Don drives, Colby next to him, the beacon locator between 
      them. Simon Kraft sits in the back seat like a bored child.

                                  COLBY
                    Standard FBI search procedure. I d 
                    think a psychic would know that.

                                  SIMON KRAFT
                    I d think the FBI would have moved on 
                    since J. Edgar Hoover.

      Don almost rises to the insult, then backs away. 

                                  DON
                    If we get within a mile of Hsaio we 
                    should get a ping off that beacon.

                                  COLBY
                    Unless we get a ping off our psychic

      Still driving. Still no ping.  They pass a High school. Simon 
      gets a weird look in his eyes.

                                  SIMON KRAFT

                    The cafeteria manager raped a student-

                    I checked you out with your old 
                    employer. The CIA says you were 
                      discharged from the service for

                    What can I say, Don? I m a hugger.

      Suddenly, Simon jerks spasmodically, pressing his face 
      against the window; his eyes wide, vacant.  Don and Colby 
      spot the change.

      Simon ambles behind, watching impassively as --

      Don fishes around with his beacon locator. Suddenly the 
      locator pulls him in a certain direction.

                    We got something, guys!

      The beacon draws them to a certain spot: a new grave with a 
      Chinese inscription. The beacon s sound resolves --

                    What the hell s going on here?

                    I don t know how this happened.

                                  DON
                    Who s grave is this?

                                    MALCOLM BITTICK
                    The man was buried Tuesday.  We re in 
                    the Chinese section, so obviously 
                    he s Chinese.  Or was.

                                  COLBY
                    And you saw nothing out of the 
                    ordinary, nobody hanging around?

                                    MALCOLM BITTICK
                    Not at this grave but -- and maybe 
                    the police told you this --

                                  COLBY
                    Told us what?

      Bittick leads them toward another Chinese grave.

                    I filed a report. My security guy 
                    chased some people away from another 
                    grave a few weeks ago. It was dark, 
                    he couldn t see who they were. 


      Colby and the last SWAT guy dig away the remaining soil -- 
      find another woman sprawled on top of a coffin: AN ASIAN 
      FEMALE, all glammed up. Deader than most. 

                                  COLBY
                    Just like the others.

      Don glances at Simon: if looks could kill.

      A window display full of formal dresses, some white, some a 
      very familiar red.

      As they start to leave they notice -- 

      Simon Kraft, wandering the street with his DV cam and a 
      sketch pad, muttering like a crazed tourist.

      He sees them, crosses to them, videotaping them.

      Simon approaches some parked cars, then notices --

      Simons starts filming it all.

      THEN ZOOMS OUT in time to see the van pull back, straighten 
      out, gather speed and drive right at him.

                    Ghost brides are a tradition as old
