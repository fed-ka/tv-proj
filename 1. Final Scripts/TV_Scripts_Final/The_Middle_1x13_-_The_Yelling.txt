                                            ACT ONE

        FADE IN:

1EXT. OFFICE WAREHOUSE -- LATE NIGHT (N7)1

        FLAT on a PLATE GLASS WINDOW.  The store is closed.  FRANKIE,
          trapped inside in her robe and sweat pants, BANGS REPEATEDLY*
        on the glass.  Desperate, she TAKES A BIG FAT MARKER, scrawls
          "Help" across a piece of poster board and smacks it flat
          against the window.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Yep, that's me, trapped in an office
                        supply store at four in the morning. 
                        How'd I end up here?  Well, how does
                        anyone end up where they don't want
                        to be?  Either drugs or kids. 

2INT. HECK FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN -- MORNING (D1)2

          Typical morning chaos.  Frankie does a million things as the
        kids get ready for school.  SUE awkwardly twirls a baton. 
        AXL watches, amused.

                                        SUE
                        How do I look?  I can take it.  I
                        need some constructive criticism. 
                        Tryouts are Thursday.

                                        AXL
                        You know what would really impress
                        the judges is if you lit the ends on
                        fire like they do in Hawaii.

                                        SUE
                        This is a serious sport, Axl.  They
                        don't just let anyone wear the white
                        patent leather boots.  

        The baton flies out of her hands and CRASHES into something
        in the breakfast room.

                                        AXL
                        Aw, man, that woulda been so much
                        cooler on fire. 

          Frankie crosses to Sue.

                                        FRANKIE
                              (to Sue)
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I thought you
                        were baby-sitting for the Craigs
                        Thursday night.  

                                        SUE
                        Oh right.  I'm gonna have to cancel.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        2.

                                        FRANKIE
                        You sure that's a good idea, honey? 
                        I'm just saying we don't know what'll
                        happen with majorettes, but if you
                        go to baby-sitting at least you know
                        you'll have six dollars.

                                        SUE
                        Mom, with the swine flu outbreak I
                        have a real shot this year.  A lot
                        of good people are down. 

        She notices BRICK is at the table reading and wearing a
          ladies' garden party hat.  

                                        FRANKIE
                        Brick?  
                              (then)
                        Oh, right.  Hat Day next week.  Well,
                        good job being ahead of schedule. 
                        That's definitely a crazy hat.

                                        BRICK
                        It's Hat Day next week?  
                              (realizing)
                        Oh no, I need a hat.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Uh... Brick?  

                                        BRICK
                        This isn't for Hat Day.  That would
                        be embarrassing.  I just wanted people
                        to pay attention to me at breakfast. 
                        Yesterday, none of you said a single
                        word to me.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Axl, you're coming home right after
                        school to work on your Aztec paper,
                        right?

                                        AXL
                        God.  Chill.  I'm on it.

          Frankie pulls a sheet of paper out of Axl's textbook that
        sits on the counter.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Are you? 
                              (reads)
                        "Twelve to fifteen pages, double
                        spaced with no fewer than six color
                        charts or graphs, bound in an Oxford 
                        ready-clip clear-front report cover." 
                        Mr. Gottlieb's tough.  
                                        (MORE)        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        3.

                                        FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        He's not going to pass you just so
                        you can play basketball.

                                        AXL
                        Yeah, parents need to talk to him. 
                        He has no school spirit.  

                                        FRANKIE
                        Axl, this is 40 percent of your grade. 
                        You do get that's almost half, right? 
                        'Cause I remember you were also "on
                        it" when you got that D in math.

                                        AXL
                        The paper's not even due for a week. 
                        God, you treat me like a little kid. 
                        I'm practically an adult.

                                        FRANKIE
                        In what way?  You don't make your
                        own food, you don't buy your own
                        clothes, you don't even remember to
                        flush the toilet unless I remind
                        you.

                                        AXL
                        I'm almost old enough to go to war.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Not if we want to win, you're not.

        MIKE enters.

                                        AXL
                        Dad, how do you live with her?

                                        MIKE
                        I live with her by doing what she
                        says.  You will do the same.

                                        AXL
                              (to Frankie)
                        God, you are so annoying!  You just
                        live to make me miserable!

        Axl exits in a huff.  Frankie looks to Mike, frustrated.  He
        pats her on the shoulder.

                                        MIKE
                              (to Frankie)
                        Maybe we should call that one a write-
                        off and just work on the others.

3INT. EHLERT MOTORS -- LATER THAT DAY (D1) 3

          Frankie and BOB are sitting and talking.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        4.

                                        BOB
                        So guess what?  Charlotte and I are
                        having our three-week anniversary. 
                        Want to see a picture of her?

        He shows Frankie his phone. 

                                        FRANKIE
                              (hugely surprised)
                        Wow.  She's pretty!
                              (covers surprise)
                        I mean she's pretty.  Are you guys
                        getting serious?

                                        BOB
                        Well, if by "serious" you mean madly
                        in love, I'd have to say...
                              (points at himself)
                        ... Guilty.  Hold on, I've got another
                        one.  Oooh, not that one.  It's
                        private.  Here's a good one.  I'll
                        forward it to your phone.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Oh no, my phone cost like a dollar. 
                        It doesn't do any of that stuff.

                                        BOB
                        Sure it does.  See.

          Frankie's phone CHIMES.  She looks at it, surprised.

                                        FRANKIE
                        My god.  I had no idea.  
                              (off picture)
                        I think you sent me the wrong picture.

                                        BOB
                        Sorry, I'll delete this for ya.

        Bob takes the phone from Frankie, then showing her...

                                        BOB (CONT'D)
                        Look.  It can take pictures too. 
                        Smile!  And movies...

                                        FRANKIE
                        No way!

        Bob holds the phone out and points it at himself and Frankie.  

                                        BOB
                        Yeah, you can make your own movie. 
                        You can put faces on thimbles and
                        act out your entire prom the way it
                        should have gone.  It's very
                        cathartic.  I hear.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        5.

4INT. HECK FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN -- THAT AFTERNOON (D1)4

          Brick watches TV in the family room, as Frankie enters.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Hey.  How's it going?  You find a
                        hat yet for Hat Day?

                                        BRICK
                        God.  I'm on it.  Chill.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Don't even.

                                        BRICK
                        Sorry.  I want to be like Axl, but I
                        can't really pull it off.

          Frankie crosses into the kitchen where Axl is also watching
        TV.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Axl, why is your textbook in the
                        exact same position it was in this
                        morning?  It hasn't moved.

        Axl reaches out and pushes the book a few inches.

                                        AXL
                        There.  Now it's moved.  Happy?

                                        FRANKIE
                        You better watch your tone, mister.

                                        AXL
                        What tone?  You're always imagining
                        this tone...  Uch.  Why do you have
                        to ride me all the time?

          Something occurs to Frankie.  

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        And then I got an idea.  A brilliant,
                        glorious idea. 

            Surreptitiously, she takes her phone out of her purse, sets
        it down and points it at Axl, presses RECORD.

                                        AXL
                        Seriously, when did you hatch this
                        plan to ruin my life?  Was it like,
                        when I was a baby?

                                        AXL (CONT'D)
                        Was it some, like, joke to you where
                        you wanted to get revenge or something
                        and you decided to have a kid and
                        then systematically destroy him minute
                        by minute until you achieve total
                        mind control?

        Axl continues as the phone records him.  Frankie smiles a
          satisfied smile.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        I would film my kids and show them
                        what they sounded like.

        Sue is spazzily twirling her baton.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Honey.  Can you please not twirl in
                        the house?

                                        SUE
                        Well, where am I supposed to do it? 
                        It's too cold out and my fingers
                        freeze up.  If I can't practice, I
                        won't make it and then it will be
                        ALL YOUR FAULT!

          Frankie gets a look in her eye, pulls out her phone, presses
          RECORD.

6INT. HECK KITCHEN -- THAT DAY (D1)6

          Brick's reading.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Brick, your dad's going to the mall. 
                        Do you want to go with him and look
                        for a hat?  
                              (he doesn't look up)
                        Brick...?  Brick...?  

        She presses RECORD.

                                        FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Brick?  Any response would be nice.

          Brick holds up a "wait a minute" finger.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        And once I started, I couldn't stop. 
                        This thing was power.         EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        7.

          A hand reaches in, grabs the phone, snaps it SHUT.  Frankie
          triumphantly shoves it into her pocket and crosses out. 

14INT. HECK FAMILY ROOM -- DAYS LATER (D4)14

          Bob's behind the TV connecting it to Frankie's phone.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        8.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        After several days of collecting
                        evidence, it was showtime.  I wasn't
                        just doing this for myself, I was
                        doing it for moms through the ages
                        who'd had enough.

        Mike enters from outside and sees Frankie.

                                        MIKE
                        Hey honey.

        Bob stands up from behind the TV, revealing himself to Mike.

                                        BOB
                        Hey Mike.

                                        MIKE
                              (uneasy)
                        Oh hey, Bob.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Bob's helping me set up that thing I
                        told you about that I want to show
                        the kids.

                                        MIKE
                        Oh.  How long's that gonna take?

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        I had long ago accepted that Mike
                        and Bob weren't gonna ever be friends. 
                        It's not that Mike didn't like Bob,
                        it's just -- yeah, he just didn't
                        like him.

                                        BOB
                        So.  Michael Michael Bo-Bikel.  How
                        goeth the job search?  

        Bob playfully boxes Mike in the stomach... Mike not-so-
          playfully stops him.

                                        MIKE
                        Little slow.  That's why I like to
                        come home and relax.

                        Poor Mike.  I just want you to know
                        I'm here for you if you ever need a
                        shoulder to cry on.  I also belong
                        to a men's drum circle on Tuesday

                                        MIKE
                        I think it would maybe increase my
                        rage.  

                                        BOB
                        Hey.  I'm an idiot!  Why didn't I
                        think of this?  The guy who rides
                        shotgun on my night shift delivering
                        Little Betty Snack Cakes just quit. 
                        If you're interested, I can put in
                        your name.  Union pay.  Easy gig.

                                        MIKE
                        Oh, I don't know, Bob.  Wouldn't
                        want to put you out.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Union pay.  Easy gig.  Mike...

        Mike looks at Frankie, then knowing he's got no choice.

                                        MIKE
                              (pained)
                        Sounds great.

                        Kids, get in here!

        They trickle in.  

                                        FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Hey guys, sit down.  

          Frankie takes her phone, which is now connected to the TV,
        as the kids sit. 

                                        AXL
                        Fine.  I was about to start my paper,
                        but whatever.

                                        FRANKIE
                        We're all gonna watch a little
                          educational television today.  There's
                        been some bad behavior going on and
                        I think it's time I brought it to
                        your attention.  And I must warn you
                        that what you're about to see is not
                        pretty. 

        She pushes a button on her phone.  We see ON THE TV --

                                        AXL (ON TV - PT Scene 4)
                        -- When did you hatch this plan to
                        ruin my life?...        EP 113 - "the yelling" - rev. blue - 12.4.09        10.

                                        AXL
                        Hey, you recorded me? 

                                        AXL (ON TV - PT Scene 4)
                        ... Was it like some joke to you*
                        where you wanted to get revenge or*
                        something and you decided to have a*
                        kid and then systematically destroy*
                        him minute by minute until you achieve*
                        total mind control?*

        And then we see Frankie on the TV.

                                        FRANKIE (ON TV - PT Scene 4)
                        Obviously I don't have to destroy
                        your life, Axl.  Because you're doing
                        a pretty damn good job of it yourself. 
                              (losing it)
                        Time is passing, Axl!  I can't take
                        it!   
                              (yelling)
                        I went to school!  I did my homework! 
                        Why do I have to --

        They all turn and look at Frankie, who fiddles with the phone.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Hang on.  That's not the right spot.
                                (fast-forwarding)
                        Here we go.

        On the TV we see --

                                        SUE (ON TV - PT Scene 5)
                        ... and it will be ALL YOUR FAULT!

                                        FRANKIE
                        Not so pretty, Sue, is it?

        And then...

                                        FRANKIE (ON TV - PT Scene 5)
                        My fault?  Why is everything my fault?
                              (yelling)
                        Tell you what's gonna be my fault. 
                        If you forget to call Mrs. Craig and
                        tell her you can't sit Thursday!  Am
                        I talking for my own health here?  

        Mike looks at her, uncomfortably, as Frankie pushes buttons
        on her phone again.

                                        FRANKIE
                          Wa-wa-wait.  That's wrong.

        She keeps FAST-FORWARDING so it plays as a series of QUICK
          POPS.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        11.

                        I have had it with you!  All you

                        Someday I'll be dead and you'll wish
                        you could hear my voice!

                                        FRANKIE (ON TV - Sc - X14C - DAY)
                              (losing it to Sue)
                        What part of "Don't twirl in the
                        house" was I not clear about?!

                                        FRANKIE (ON TV - Sc - X14D - DAY)
                              (losing it to Axl)
                        This is the last time I'm telling
                        you!

                                        FRANKIE (ON TV - Sc - X14E - DAY)
                              (losing it to Brick)
                        I'm not telling you again!

                                        FRANKIE (ON TV - Sc - X14F - DAY)
                              (screaming at the top
                              of her lungs)
                        I will not say this one more time!

          Frankie FREEZES THE TV on a very unflattering IMAGE of herself
        in mid-rant.  The family looks at it and then back at her. 
        She stares, dumbfounded and chagrined.

                                        FRANKIE
                        ... so let that be a lesson to you.

15INT. HECK MASTER BEDROOM -- THAT NIGHT (N4)15

          Frankie and Mike are getting into bed. 

                                        FRANKIE
                        I do not yell like that, Mike.  I'm
                        sorry, that phone is not accurate. 
                        It's not even a camera for godsakes,
                        it has no business recording anything.  
                              (then)
                        You can jump in any time, you know.

                                        MIKE
                        You're pretty.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Oh my God.  I can't believe you! 
                        You think it's right.  You think
                        that's what I sound like.

                                        MIKE
                        Honey, I'm the wrong person to ask. 
                        I don't know what you sound like.  I
                        don't even hear it anymore.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Well, it's not my fault.  They don't
                        listen 'til I yell.  I'm tired, and
                        they push me, Mike.  You see how
                        they push me.  

                                        MIKE
                        They do.  They're horrible.  Horrible,
                        horrible children.  

                                        FRANKIE
                        This isn't who I wanted to be.

                                        MIKE
                        Well, too late now.  'Night, honey.

        He turns OFF the LIGHT.  A beat.  She turns it back on.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I'm gonna change.  

                                        MIKE
                              (with dread)
                        Awwww no, don't change...  

                                        FRANKIE
                        I am.  I'm gonna quit yelling.  
                              (then)
                        What?  You don't think I can?          EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        13.

                                        MIKE
                        I think it'll be like when you quit
                        sugar, and a day later I found you
                        on the bathroom floor sucking frosting
                        out of the tube.

                                        FRANKIE
                        This isn't sugar.  I don't want my
                        kids growing up and telling some
                        shrink, "All my mom did my whole
                        life was yell at me."  

                                        MIKE
                        They're not gonna be able to afford
                        a shrink.

        He turns off the light.

16INT. HECK KITCHEN -- NEXT MORNING (D5)16

          Frankie sits with the three kids at the kitchen table.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Okay, guys.  I called you all together
                        because I want to show you an example
                        of someone accepting responsibility
                        and trying to do better.  I've decided
                        I don't like the way I sounded on
                        the tape.  Seems once in a while I
                        raise my voice --

                                        AXL
                        Once in a while you don't raise your
                        voice.

                                        FRANKIE
                        The point is, we've gotten into a
                        bad pattern -- I nag, you don't
                        listen, and I end up yelling.  So
                        let's make a deal.  From now on,
                        I'll calmly ask you to do something
                        once.  Then you'll show me you can
                        listen, and I'll show you I don't
                        need to yell.

                                        BRICK
                        So you're gonna stop nagging?

                                        FRANKIE
                        I'm gonna start trusting that you
                        can do things when I ask you to.

                                        AXL
                        So what do we get if you do yell?

                                        FRANKIE
                        It doesn't work that way.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        14.


                                        SUE
                        We should get something.

                                        FRANKIE
                        That's not what this is about.

                                        BRICK
                        How 'bout a Tootsie Roll?

                                        SUE
                        Ooh, I like waffles.

                                        AXL
                        That's stupid.  We should get money.

                                        FRANKIE
                              (yelling)
                        This is not some contest with prizes! 
                        This is about us becoming the kind
                        of family where the mother doesn't
                        have to yell!  
                              (calmly)
                        Starting now.                         

17INT. EHLERT MOTORS -- LATER THAT DAY (D5)17

          Frankie and Bob are at the coffee maker.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I'm telling you I feel great.  I
                        trust them, they'll feel respected
                        and respect me in return by doing
                        what they're told.  It's a trust
                        circle.  A trust-respect circle
                        really.  Or is it an oval?  It's
                        kind of a new concept, so we're still
                        figuring out the shape.   

          Bob's phone CHIMES.

                                        BOB
                        That'll be my special lady.  
                              (looks)
                        No, wait.  It's my boss at Little
                        Betty.  He's willing to hire Mike to
                        drive the late shift with me!

                                        FRANKIE
                              (takes out her phone
                              and dials)
                        That is great!  Mike'll be so excited.

                                        BOB
                        Let me tell him!

        Bob takes the phone.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        15.

                        Hey.

                                        BOB
                        Axl, it's Bob.  Is your dad there?

                                        AXL
                        No, he went out to buy bread or a
                        boat or something.

                                        FRANKIE
                              (to Bob)
                        Axl's home?  He's supposed to be at
                        the library.  Ask him if he's working
                        on his Aztec paper.

                                        BOB
                              (awkwardly into phone)
                        So... what are you doing there, buddy?

                                        AXL
                              (confused)
                        Nothing.  Just hanging out.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Is the TV on?  Is he watching TV?

                                        BOB
                              (into phone)
                        So... you watching TV?

                                        AXL
                        This is getting a little creepy, Bob.

                                        FRANKIE
                              (whispering)
                        Ask him if he can tell you the
                        difference between the Mayan and
                        Aztec cultures.

                                        BOB
                              (sotto)
                        I don't know how to work that in
                        naturally to the conversation.

                        Bob, are you talking to my mother?

                        No, haven't seen her.  Bye.
                              (hangs up)
                        I think he's on to us.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        16.


19INT. HECK FAMILY ROOM -- LATER THAT DAY (D5)19

          Frankie enters from work to find all three kids on the couch
          watching TV.

                                        FRANKIE  (V.O.)
                        This was going to be harder than I
                        thought.  Days were passing and who
                        knew if they were living up to their
                        end of the deal.  They weren't saying
                        anything and I couldn't ask.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Hey.  There's my hard-working kids. 

A20INT. HECK FAMILY ROOM -- THE NEXT DAY (D6) A20

          Frankie enters to find the kids watching TV again.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Hey, there's...
                              (growing suspicious)
                        My kids.

B20INT. HECK FAMILY ROOM -- THE NEXT DAY (D7)B20

          Frankie enters to find the kids watching TV again.

                                        FRANKIE
                              (more suspicious)
                        There's... a lot on TV this week,
                        huh?  

        She puts a smile on her face and heads for the kitchen.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        The urge to yell and nag was building,
                        but that's okay.  I knew how to deal
                        with it.

20INT. HECK KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS (D7)20

        She grabs a tube of frosting from a cabinet, and frantically
          starts sucking it down.  

                                                                            CUT TO BLACK.

21INT. HECK MASTER BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT -- EVENING (N7)21

          Mike's getting dressed in his Little Betty uniform.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Mike was getting ready for his first
                        night on the job with Bob and I'd
                        gone three whole days without
                        screaming at my kids.  Hard to say
                        who was more miserable.  

          Frankie enters and flops on the bed.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Aw, hell, it was me.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I can't do it, Mike.  I can't keep
                        this up.  I'm itchy, I have a stomach
                        ache and my jaw hurts from all the
                        clenching.  I wanna yell, I wanna
                        yell so bad.

                                        MIKE
                        Ah, you're just going through
                          withdrawal.  

                                        FRANKIE
                        Mike, it's not that I enjoy yelling. 
                        I do it for the children.  

                                        MIKE
                        That's what junkies do.  They justify
                        anything to get their next fix.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Pretty tough talk from a guy with a
                        cupcake on his shirt.  

          A beat.

                                        MIKE
                        I'm just saying, what happened to
                        that whole trust circle thing?  

                                        FRANKIE
                        It's a trust respect oval, and what
                        happened is that it's a load of crap.  

                                        MIKE
                        Honey, you said you wanted to trust
                        the kids.  Maybe you should try
                        actually doing it.  They might
                        surprise you.  
                                        (MORE)        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        18.

                                        MIKE (CONT'D)
                              (then)
                        You know this morning Sue was cleaning
                        her room.

                                        FRANKIE
                              (surprised)
                        Really?

                                        MIKE
                        They're growing up, Frankie.  Cut
                        yourself some slack, and focus on
                        what's really important.  Help me
                        figure out how the hell I'm going to
                        make it through a whole night stuck
                        in a truck with Bob.    

          Frankie laughs.  

22INT. HECK KITCHEN/FAMILY ROOM -- A FEW MINUTES LATER (N7)22

          Frankie comes down the hall.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        So yeah, Mike thought the kids had
                        grown up.  But frankly, he said that
                        as soon as we brought them home from
                        the hospital.  But then...

        From FRANKIE'S POV we see Brick and Sue at the table.  Brick
        is reading with a porkpie hat on.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Brick, where'd you get that hat?  I
                        thought you didn't have one? 

                                        BRICK
                        Got it myself.  Wore it to Hat Day. 
                        Was the coolest kid at school.
                              (whispering)
                        Coolest kid.

        We hear a HORN HONK from outside.  Sue gets up, grabs her
          jacket and baton and heads for the front door.

                                        SUE
                        That's my ride.  I'm going to
                        majorette tryouts.  

                                        FRANKIE
                              (calling after)
                        You arranged your own ride?

                                        SUE
                        Yeah.  Wish me luck!        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        19.

        On her way out, Sue makes a flamboyant gesture with her baton
        and gets it stuck in the iron decorative screens.  She has
        to work it like a maze to get it out.  

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Wow.  And just when I thought it
                        couldn't get any better... 

          Frankie spots Axl sitting with his textbook open, working on
        his paper.  She just stares at him.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ... The best and most amazing thing
                        of all... Axl was writing his history
                        paper.  On his own.  Without any
                        nagging or yelling from me.  

        Axl looks up and sees his mother gawking at him.

                                        AXL
                        What?

                                        FRANKIE
                              (way too emotional)
                        Hey Axl!

23INT. LITTLE BETTY DELIVERY TRUCK - MOVING -- EVENING (N7)23

        Mike rides shotgun as Bob sits behind a huge wheel, driving. 

                                        BOB
                        Welcome to my time, Mike, when the
                        town begins to sleep and we can prowl
                        in the silence.

                                        MIKE
                        Yeah, I can't really hear the
                        silence...

          Bob's phone CHIMES.  He looks at the readout.

                                        BOB
                        Oh, look at that.  The lady owl
                        awakes.
                              (texting)
                        "Hey pretty bird.  First night on
                        the road with my BFF Mike".

                                        MIKE
                        Uh, I don't think you should do that
                        while you drive.

                                        BOB
                        Oh, it's fine.  I'm a fast texter.

        He continues to type, causing the truck to VEER OFF THE ROAD. 
        Mike grabs the wheel.        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        20.

                                        MIKE
                        Bob, knock it off and drive.

        The phone CHIMES AGAIN.  Before he can read, Mike takes it. 

                                        BOB
                        Read it to me. 

                                        MIKE
                        No.

                                        BOB
                        Come on.  What does she say?

        He leans over to look, and in doing so, the truck swerves
          wildly.  Fearing for his life, Mike reads --

                                        MIKE
                        "Hey... Bobby beast... boy."  
                              (then)
                        As long as you're swerving, can you
                        find a bridge or something and make
                        it quick?

24INT. HECK MASTER BATHROOM -- NIGHT (N7)24

          Frankie runs a bath in her robe.  

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Turns out Mike was right.  The kids
                        had surprised me.  I felt this new
                        sense of freedom opening up for me,
                        endless possibilities.  Like finally
                        using those bath salts I got for
                        Mother's Day...

        She picks up a decorative jar of bath salts.  She turns it
          upside down and the bath salts remain stuck together inside. 

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ...2001.

        She shakes the jar, and all the salts come out in one cinder
          block lump.  She drops the robe and starts to get in.  Her
        toe just touches the water, when... the DOORBELL RINGS.  She
          takes her toe out.

                                        FRANKIE
                              (calling)
                        Can somebody get that?

        She puts her toe back into the water, when the DOORBELL RINGS
          again.  She takes her foot out.

                                        FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Anybody got it?        EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        21.

        She puts her toe in again, and there is a third RING.

25INT. HECK FAMILY ROOM/KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER (N7)25

          Frankie enters in her robe to find Axl with his iPod in and
          Brick reading a book.  

                                        FRANKIE
                        Hello?  Can anybody hear the bell?

                                        BRICK
                        Yeah, it's really annoying.

          Frankie goes to the door and opens it to find ELLEN CRAIG in
        her Sunday best, holding her one year-old baby.

                                        ELLEN
                        Hey Frankie.  We're late for Kiwanis. 
                        Sue was supposed to be at my house
                        an hour ago to baby-sit.

                                        FRANKIE
                        What?  But she's at baton tryouts.  She
                        called you to cancel... didn't she? 

                                        ELLEN
                        No, she didn't.  I'm really
                        disappointed in you, Frankie.  I
                        thought you were a better mother
                        than this.  
                              (hands her baby)
                        Here, I'll be back in a couple hours.  

          Ellen exits, leaving Frankie with the baby.  Frankie shuts
        the door and heads back toward the kitchen.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I can't believe this...  What is
                        wrong with Sue?  Brick, sit with the
                        baby for a minute while I get dressed.

                                        BRICK
                        That might not be a good idea.  It
                        could get my lice.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Your what?

                                        BRICK
                        Oh yeah, my teacher said to give you
                        this note.

        He hands her a note.  

                                        FRANKIE
                              (realizing)
                        Brick, where did you get that hat?          EP 113 - "the yelling" - shooting script - 12.3.09        22.

                                        BRICK
                        Well, you didn't remind me to take a
                        hat on Tuesday, so I didn't have
                        one, but then I saw this homeless
                        guy going through the trash.  So I
                        traded him my banana for it.   

                                        FRANKIE
                        Oh my god!  Brick, what is wrong
                        with you?  Take that disgusting thing
                        off and put it in the trash.  Everyone
                        stay away from Brick's head.  

        She rushes into the family room and holds out the baby.

                                        FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Okay, Axl, I need your help.  We
                        have to burn all the sheets and scrub
                        down the house.

26INT. LITTLE BETTY DELIVERY TRUCK - MOVING -- NIGHT (N7)26

        Mike sits with Bob, who drives.  Bob's phone CHIMES.

                              (excited)

                        need to feel the pain like a searing

                        Bob, this is a little personal.  I
                        think you should read it yourself.

                        I can't.  I can't see anything through
                        the tears.

27INT. OFFICE WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT (N7)27

          Frankie rushes into the store past the 22-year-old Assistant
          Manager, who is just taking out his keys to lock up.  He
          doesn't see her.  Another MOM in a robe comes flying out of
        an aisle, grasping a report cover, spots the desperate look
        in Frankie's eyes.

                                        OTHER MOM
                        Mr. Gottlieb's Aztec paper?

                                        FRANKIE
                        Yes!  Oxford ready-clip clear-front?

                                        OTHER MOM
                        Aisle three!  There's one left!

                                        FRANKIE
                        God bless you!

          Frankie runs down an aisle filled with report covers.  She
          sifts through them, then spots the right one at the back of
        the shelf.  She reaches out for it and accidentally pushes
        it off the other side of the shelf into the next aisle.

          Frankie runs into the next aisle and gets down on the floor
        to look for the cover.  Spotting it under the next set of
          shelves, she reaches farther, farther... and gets it. 
          Suddenly the LIGHTS GO OUT.  Frankie stands up.

        She runs into the entrance area to find the place deserted. 
        She runs to the glass doors and begins pounding.

                                        FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Hey!  Wait!  Somebody!

28INT. LITTLE BETTY DELIVERY TRUCK - MOVING -- NIGHT (N7)28

        Mike is now driving.  Bob looks wrecked as he stuffs his
        face with Little Betty Snack Cakes.

                                        BOB
                        It's my fault.  I got on her nerves. 
                        I texted her every ten minutes.

        Mike pulls the truck over and stops.

                                        MIKE
                        Look, Bob, there's lots of girls out
                        there.  

                                        BOB
                        Oh sure, says the seven foot god.

                                        MIKE
                        I don't know...  Well, sometimes
                        you're a little needy.

                                        BOB
                              (wailing)
                        Oh my God, I'm needy?

        Bob lets out a sob of pain and runs out of the truck into
        the darkness.

                                        MIKE
                        Aw, dammit.

29EXT. FIELD -- CONTINUOUS (N7)29

        Bob is running with his arms waving, completely hysterical. 
        Mike gets out of the truck and chases him, tackling him to
        the ground.  Bob lets out a SCREAM.  Mike sits on him.

                                        BOB
                        Get off me!  Haven't I suffered
                        enough?!

                                        MIKE
                        I'll get off if you'll promise to
                        calm down.

                                        BOB
                        I promise.  Just let me sit up.

        Mike gets up.  Bob immediately lets out a SCREAM as he takes
        off again, hysterical.  Mike goes after him again and tackles
        him a second time.

30INT. OFFICE WAREHOUSE -- LATE NIGHT (N7)30

          Frankie is at the register talking into the store phone...

                        ...So when is the security guard

                        it, and I'm going to rub my head
                        over every inch of this store, would

        Mike and Bob are now sitting side by side.  Bob is calmer.

                        You're right.  You're right.  I am

                        First of all, you're spitting into
                        my mouth a little bit.  So I think
                        personal space would be a good place
                        to start.

                        Maybe you can try and win her back? 
                        You can go to her house right now --

                                        BOB
                        I can't do that.  I don't know where
                        she lives.  I know it's somewhere in
                        New Mexico.  I should have gotten
                        her last name back when we were in
                        love.  

                                        MIKE
                        Wait.  This is just some internet
                        woman?  

                                        BOB
                        Just?  We danced for each other on
                        iChat.  
                              (then)
                        She was the whole package.  She had
                        three kids.  A little house.  A cat. 
                        I could have walked right in had a
                        life.  I could have been like you.

          A beat.  Mike takes this in.  Heaves a big sigh. 

                                        MIKE
                        So, after the shift, why don't you
                        get some sleep, then come by tomorrow
                        night for dinner?  We'll put up some
                        burgers.

                              (then)
                        Mike, can I tell you something I've
                        never told anyone in the whole world?  

                                        MIKE

33INT. OFFICE WAREHOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT (N7)33

          Frankie is still waiting as Mike and the kids (Brick in his
          shower cap) finally show up with a SECURITY GUARD.

                                        FRANKIE
                        There you are.

                                        FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Finally, Mike showed up with the
                        kids to make sure I got sprung.  The
                        Craigs had gotten their baby, Brick
                        got his lice medicine, and though
                        she hadn't heard yet, Sue was not
                        feeling very confident about her
                        chances of making majorettes.

        Sue smiles weakly, gauze on her eye and a bent baton in her
          hand.  Frankie looks at them and paces back and forth like a
          caged animal.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I've had a lot of time to think in
                        here and I've figured out a few things --
                        You know, there might be families
                        out there somewhere where the moms
                        don't have to yell, but guess what?  
                              (yelling)
                        We're not one of them!  You know why
                        I pester and nag and get on your
                        case and yell like a crazy person? 
                        Because nothing ever gets done if I
                        don't!!!  So that's what we're going
                        back to!  I don't care if it makes
                        me look bad, it gets the job done! 
                        You know what else --

34EXT. OFFICE WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS (N7)34

        Mike and the kids watch Frankie's tirade, but now we see that
        she is yelling but THEY CAN'T HEAR A WORD THROUGH THE GLASS. 

                                        BRICK
                        What's she saying?

                                        MIKE
                        I don't know.  Just... bow your heads. 
                        Look ashamed.

        They do.  Frankie keeps yelling.  

                                        MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Now nod.  Just nod like we know what

                        That's okay.  Take your time.
