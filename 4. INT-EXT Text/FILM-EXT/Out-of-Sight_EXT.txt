As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in.
A BASKETBALL GAME in progress.
All of the men, Foley included,
are dressed in blue coveralls and white T-shirts.
The game is
rough.
Hair is pulled.
Eyes are poked.
Faces punched.
A title reads: "GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION.
BELLE GLADE,
FLORIDA."
Foley is the oldest player here.
He's getting tired, starts to
lose his breath.
He finally walks off the court, breathing so
hard he can't even talk.
He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT
to come in and take his place.
Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath.
He looks
across the yard to where...
A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES
sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards.
All of
them are over sixty.
One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches
hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we...
INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM:
As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal
Mal and Lucky Strike packs.
Another tends to a tomato bush in
a tiny patch of garden near the wall.
Another one sits nearby
painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.
Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches
his eye.
He watches as...
TWO LATINO MEN
both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop
and begin stretching out.
One of them nods to Foley.
Foley
nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks
over to a guard, PUPKO ("PUP"), heavy-set, dumb as dirt.
PUP
You want something, Foley?
Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game.
FOLEY
Some people are going out of here.
What if I told you where and when?
PUP
How many?
FOLEY
I expect you to look out for me, Pup,
let me run off work details.
PUP
Okay.
How many going out?
FOLEY
I hear six.
PUP
When?
FOLEY
Looks like tonight.
PUP
You know who they are?
FOLEY
I do, but I won't tell you just yet.
Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty,
right before lock-down.
Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette.
He puts an arm
around Lulu, starts to walk off...
FOLEY (OS)
Today's the day, huh?
Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip
down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt... the next
thing to having him on a leash.
FOLEY
You excited?
CHINO
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
FOLEY
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
CHINO
(beat)
Why you think is today?
FOLEY
You were out running this morning,
sticking to your routine, anybody
happened to notice.
But you only did
a couple of miles instead of your usual
five.
Saving yourself for the main
event.
Then I see you inside eating
ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates
for endurance.
Chino and Lulu exchange looks.
CHINO
You want, I tole you you can come.
You all right, Foley.
I like you.
FOLEY
You told me I can come 'cause I caught
you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you
and Lulu coming out of the bushes,
thought maybe you two were making out.
Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.
FOLEY (CONT'D)
So what, you finish ahead of schedule?
Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.
CHINO
You see what they doing, those posts
out there?
Putting up another fence,
five metres on the other side of the
one that's there.
We wait until Super
Bowl Sunday, they could have the second
fence built and we have to dig another
nine, ten days.
So we going soon as
it's dark.
You want -- I mean it --
you can still come.
FOLEY
I appreciate the offer.
And it's
tempting.
Foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence
not twenty yards away.
FOLEY (CONT'D)
But, man, it's a long run to
civilization.
A hundred miles to Miami?
I'm too old to start acting crazy, try
a stunt like that.
You make it out,
send me a postcard.
CUT TO: A NOTEPAD
where we see someone has written "IT'S MAGIC!" then crossed out
the "IT'S" and replaced it with the word "LIKE".
We hear THE
PHONE RING AND...
A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE
"SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing
trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook.
Title reads: LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.
LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA.
And then... TWO YEARS AGO.
AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM
Foley leans in a doorway watching with BUDDY BRAGG -- black,
Foley's age, shaved head.
The BELL SOUNDS and the white guy staggers to his corner, as
does Maurice.
GLENN MICHAELS -- surfer look, dark shades --
counts cash in Maurice's corner, whispers something into the
fighter's ear.
BUDDY
Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's
gonna send this guy out in a body bag.
Foley watches a MAN -- fifties, out of place, not as hard-looking
as those around him.
The guy looks nervous, can feel the other
cons' eyes on him as he tries to find a seat.
The BELL SOUNDS and the white boxer staggers to his feet.
Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling.
Foley turns
and watches the fight now...
FOLEY
Anyone ever tell you why they call him
Snoopy?
Buddy shakes his head.
Maurice dances around the other guy
now.
Teases him.
FOLEY (CONT'D)
He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back
when he was pro.
Now you pet him, he
goes down.
The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely
glances off Maurice's jaw.
Sure enough, Maurice makes a big
show out of snapping his head back, staggering, before he finally
goes down.
BUDDY
I don't believe it.
Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him
and, anxious now, he tries to get out of there.
Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as
nearby, the "winning" BOXER -- still wearing last night's
pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons.
He throws
a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning
technique...
BUDDY
Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight.
Fuckin' pathetic.
Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now
stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one
hand thrust into his pocket.
Foley watches as Maurice stops
the NEW INMATE -- the older guy who looked out of place at the
fights -- as he comes out into the yard.
FOLEY
It's Richard Ripley.
BUDDY
(looking now)
The Wall Street guy?
Oh, yeah.
I
didn't recognize him without his rug.
Foley watches as Maurice talks to the new inmate, the guy
nodding, acquiescent, respectful.
FOLEY
Dick the Ripper they called him, on
account of all the people he ripped
off.
Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a BLACK BOOK.
BUDDY
What's he doin' here?
GLENN (OS)
Three years.
They look to where Glenn Michaels, the blond guy in dark shades
we saw in Maurice's corner, works out on the bench press a few
feet away.
He's shirtless, tan, in shape.
GLENN
He got three years and fined fifty
million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking
check.
Like that, fifty mil, signed
his name.
(struggles with the
bar)
Whoa-- little help here!
FOLEY
Who you talkin' to, Studs?
Me, or
Buddy.
I can't tell, you got those
shades on.
GLENN
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
FOLEY
I guess the bright glare out here made
it hard to see the numbers on the
weights.
GLENN
I'll take the shades off.
Just get
this fuckin' thing off me.
Foley helps him get the bar up.
Glenn sits up.
BUDDY
How do you know he wrote a check?
GLENN
He told me.
He works the laundry with
me.
The guy loves to talk.
FOLEY
Yeah, to the U.S. Attorney.
I hear he
rolled over on all the snitches he was
doing business with and got 'em all
brought up.
He watches Snoopy talking to Ripley, one eye always on the
swaggering boxer across the yard, one hand in his pocket.
GLENN
Hey, anybody that can write a check
for fifty mil, he says anything I'm
all fucking ears.
Like the other day,
he tells me how he's got all this money
in foreign banks, plus around five mil
in uncut diamonds at his house.
He
said, quote, "Where I can put my hands
on it anytime."
BUDDY
Cool.
Where's the guy live?
Foley watches a few more of Maurice's friends surround Ripley.
Again, Ripley takes out his black book, starts nodding, making
notations...
GLENN
Detroit.
Snoopy Miller told me uncut
diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
FOLEY
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?
They look like plain old rocks.
GLENN
So.
What's your point?
FOLEY
My point is, that's probably what you're
gonna end up with.
GLENN
You think he's lying?
FOLEY
Use your head.
The guys got five
million lying around his house, you
really think he's gonna tell some
motormouth he just met in prison about
it?
A BELL SOUNDS.
Everyone starts walking for the gate.
Foley watches as the Boxer and his crew head for the gate,
Maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket.
SLOW MOTION AS the boxer gets to the gate, sees Maurice who
moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him... his
left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like
congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket
and we see the long metal shiv--
BUDDY
(watching Snoopy)
Here it comes.
Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs
him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away.
The Boxer
stands there like a statue, doesn't move until he's at last
jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
I guess the Snoop doesn't like to lose,
even if it's on purpose.
We hear a WHISTLE BLOW as a GUARD spots the body.
And now
everyone moves like hell for the gate... except for...
Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the
body.
Foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes
Ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks
to him as they walk into the block...
FOLEY
You don't wanna be standing there, the
hacks start asking questions you don't
wanna answer.
RIPLEY
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Foley then moves away.
He sees Maurice looking back at him,
giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.
DISSOLVE TO:
As Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling
a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door,
when he sees...
A WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come
out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries.
Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman
is opening her trunk before coming forward...
BUDDY
Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am.
She doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the
groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock.
WOMAN
I didn't ask for your help, so don't
expect a tip.
Buddy smiles, waves her off.
BUDDY
That's okay, ma'am.
I'll just take
your car.
She stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off.
As Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty,
standing by the hole they just crawled out of.
KAREN
Get your hands in the air!
Buddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds,
start edging away -- shit, they've come this far.
They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark,
then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate,
to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it
for the cons.
They take off running...
Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't
fire...
The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it,
open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are
cut down as they run.
The hacks glance at Karen, but don't bother with her, more
interested in the hole the convicts had come out of.
Now they're
standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons
ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other
as...
A head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying
something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited,
pointing towards the orange grove.
They run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to
see if they're alive, then keep going.
The man in the hole, Foley, climbs out.
He takes his time,
puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an
honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes.
Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the
shotgun on Buddy.
Buddy raises the palm of his hand.
BUDDY
It's okay, honey, we're good guys.
KAREN
What're you doing here?
Not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when
they're already pretty sure what you're doing.
She glances
around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature
out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck.
She fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the
shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip.
They drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still
up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence,
past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange
grove.
A moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.
FOLEY
I bet that's all the hacks they send
out.
Otherwise nobody's left to mind
the store.
BUDDY
Why don't we talk about it later?
He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the
headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid.
FOLEY
Why you're just a girl.
What do you
do for a living you pack a shotgun?
KAREN
I'm a federal marshal and you're under
arrest, both of you guys.
Foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious
thought, but what he says is...
FOLEY
I bet I smell, don't I?
(then)
Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll
get out of here.
Karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk.
She's
reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when...
Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against
the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're
cuddled up in bed.
He holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the
gun in his face.
Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then
everything goes...
BLACK
Total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing.
Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along.
FOLEY (VO)
You comfy?
KAREN (VO)
If I could have a little more room.
FOLEY (VO)
There isn't any.
All this shit you
got in here.
What is all this stuff
anyway?
Handcuffs, chains... what's
this can?
KAREN (VO)
For your breath.
You could use it.
Squirt some in your mouth.
FOLEY (VO)
You devil, it's mace, huh?
What've
you got here, a billy?
Use it on poor
unfortunate offenders.
A BEAM OF LIGHT appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it
on.
He plays the beam along Karen's leg, calms down some as he
looks at all of her now and finally says...
FOLEY (VO)
Where's your gun, your pistol?
KAREN
In my bag, in the car.
They go over some bumps.
We hear men's voices from somewhere
far off, outside.
KAREN (CONT'D)
You know you don't have a chance of
making it.
Guards are out here already,
they'll stop the car.
He runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also,
just, well, looking.
FOLEY
They're off in the cane by now chasing
Cubans.
I timed it to slip between
the cracks, you might say.
As Buddy floors it away from the prison, checks the rearview
mirror...
As the car turns into a main highway now...
As Buddy passes a sign that says "MIAMI, 74 MILES."
Quiet.
Empty.
A moment later the car flies past.
As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen
Audi that reads "GONE TO GET GAS."
FOLEY
Have your clothes cleaned and send me
the bill.
Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade,
move through the scrub.
Glenn leans against the car, flashers
blinking.
KAREN
I'll send it to you at Glades.
GLENN
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a
sewer?
FOLEY
Take your sunglasses off.
GLENN
I see better with them on.
FOLEY
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw
'em off the overpass while they're
still on your head.
Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans.
FOLEY (CONT'D)
Wait in the car.
GLENN
You're in civilization now, man, ease
up.
FOLEY
I'd like you to go wait in the car.
How's that?
Take her with you and put
her in back.
GLENN
In the trunk?
FOLEY
The backseat.
Foley stares at him, waiting.
Glenn motions to Karen...
GLENN
Come on.
I have to do what I'm told.
She walks past Foley without looking at him.
FOLEY
Wait a minute.
Let me have your
raincoat.
(looks at Buddy)
Somebody forgot to bring me clean
clothes.
BUDDY
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades
in the Cadillac.
You wanted to take
her car.
KAREN
You can blame me if you want.
I don't
mind.
He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds
it up, then throws it at Foley's feet.
GLENN
Here you are, sir.
Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back
on and takes Karen by the arm.
BUDDY
What's wrong with you?
Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the
backseat.
FOLEY
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll
never know.
BUDDY
How 'bout the score was his idea to
begin with?
FOLEY
His idea?
Gimme a break.
Fuckin' guy's
got a vacant lot for a head.
Was you
and me figured the whole thing out.
Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform,
all of them caked with muck.
BUDDY
You're pulling at it.
Here...
He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard
shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and
tearing the shirt.
FOLEY
I don't know why, but every time he
opens his mouth I want to punch him
out.
BUDDY
He ain't the problem, Jack.
Foley looks at him.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
You wanna pull your head outta your
ass and tell me why we're bringing her
with us?
Foley watches a car pass on the highway.
BUDDY
You want to take her to my place and
get cleaned up?
You come out of the
bathroom with your after-shave on and
she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
FOLEY
I want to talk to her again, that's
all.
See what would happen under, you
know, normal circumstances.
BUDDY
You're too late, Jack.
Foley doesn't say anything.
Just takes a deep breath as we
HEAR THE CAR START and they both look over...
BUDDY (CONT'D)
He wants to get out of here and I don't
blame him.
They start towards the car.
Then stop and watch as it takes
off, tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement.
Their backs
to us, they stand there watching the tailights until they're
out of sight down the turnpike, neither of them saying a word.
We hear SQUEAKY FOOTSTEPS OVER...
CUT TO: A CORRIDOR IN LOMPOC FPC
As Maurice Miller and his "man" -- a big black bulk named HIMEY
-- strut purposefully up the hall.
They step into...
THE PRISON LIBRARY
Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big
coffee-table book called "THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH."
MAURICE
Dick.
My man.
Ripley looks up as Maurice and Himey come strolling into the
library, sit down on either side of a now very anxious Ripley.
MAURICE (CONT'D)
I got your fishies for you.
He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the
table.
RIPLEY
(reaches for them)
Thank you...
MAURICE
(pulls them back)
Not so fast, Dick.
(off Ripley's look)
Starting now, there's gonna be an across
the board cost a living increase.
RIPLEY
What?
MAURICE
Year ago, I come in here on credit
card fraud, but after I shanked that
loudmouth pussy on the yard the other
day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone
way the fuck up.
RIPLEY
I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet.
But
then, I could be wrong...
MAURICE
Whoever.
The point is, prices are
goin' up, too.
Better get your little
black book out, Richard.
We got some
business to talk about.
Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.
MAURICE (CONT'D)
Let's start with the fish.
They was
two grand, but now they's three.
Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag.
MAURICE (CONT'D)
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you
asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
RIPLEY
(writing)
Well, I need that...
MAURICE
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an
even three c's.
VOICE
Hey.
They all look to where...
JACK FOLEY
Sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of
some kind.
Himey gives him a mean stare.
Foley points to a
sign that says "QUIET PLEASE."
FOLEY
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."
Or can't
you guys read?
MAURICE
(beat)
There a problem, Foley?
FOLEY
Yeah.
Foley shuts the big book -- CHILTON'S AUTO REPAIR.
FOLEY
Yeah, I got a problem.
This is the
dumbest fucking shakedown in the history
of dump shakedowns.
Three hundred
bucks for a pillow?
MAURICE
That's right.
RIPLEY
Sounds high, doesn't it?
FOLEY
Must be a real soft pillow.
MAURICE
Faux goose down.
RIPLEY
Still...
FOLEY
How much for your company at chow?
MAURICE
Company, shit.
I watch the man's back.
FOLEY
I bet.
How much?
MAURICE
Another C.
Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley.
FOLEY
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this
guy to fuck off.
RIPLEY
Really?
Well, I uhhh...
FOLEY
First of all, if he kills you, he's
not gonna get any more money out of
you.
Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point.
MAURICE
Man doesn't have to get killed.
He
could accidentally fall on something
sharp, like a shiv.
Or my dick.
Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point.
FOLEY
You stick anything in this guy, Snoop,
they transfer his ass outta here
faster'n you can throw a fight, and
you still end up with nothing.
Ripley nods, takes this in.
MAURICE
This doesn't concern you, Foley.
Why
don't you go on out to the yard, have
yourself a smoke?
FOLEY
I don't smoke.
HIMEY
(slowly rising)
You heard the man.
Go on outta here.
Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.
MAURICE
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.
He's ranked number thirty-two in the
federal prison system.
FOLEY
(looking at Himey)
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock
Foley in the head when...
...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand,
like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual
into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending
his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor
back-first with a loud thud.
Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A
WHISTLE.
They all freeze, look to...
A PRISONER AT ANOTHER TABLE
Who nods towards the door.
We PAN OVER just as A GUARD APPEARS,
takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up,
covers his now bleeding nose.
GUARD
What's going on here?
MAURICE
Oh, you know, reading's funnamental
an' shit, we just excited.
GUARD
Clear outta here.
The guard exits.
Maurice and Foley are still staring at each
other.
RIPLEY
Excuse me.
Snoopy?
Did we settle the
fish thing?
MAURICE
(looks at Foley)
Yeah.
Sure.
It's all settled.
He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into
Ripley's open hand.
Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a
fist, crushing the fish.
He taps his fist to Ripley's.
RIPLEY
That's how you do it.
Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with
Himey.
Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at
Foley.
RIPLEY
Thanks for your help.
FOLEY
Any time.
We hear a PHONE RING and then...
CUT TO: MAURICE MILLER'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - (NOW)
As Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television.
MAURICE
Stick and jab, fool.
Stick and jab.
A frisbee whizzes past the television.
We hear A DOG YELP OS.
MAURICE (CONT'D)
Hey!
Watch that shit!
Maurice's girlfriend MOSELLE - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a
green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as THE PHONE
RINGS AWAY on the bedside table right next to Maurice.
MOSELLE
(calls OS)
Tuffy.
C'mere, boy...
MAURICE
You gonna answer the phone?
MOSELLE
What for?
It's not for me.
Maurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a
little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's
head.
MOSELLE (CONT'D)
Bad dog.
MAURICE
(scoops up the dog)
Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my
little Tuffy?
He lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child.
MOSELLE
I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a
Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra
money.
He looks at her.
MAURICE
That's the dumbest thing I heard in my
life.
Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't
pay for shit.
You gonna get a gig,
it's gotta be for one of the big three:
Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit
for the fat dogs.
Now answer the fuckin
phone.
She comes over, picks up the phone.
MOSELLE
Hello?
(hands it to Maurice)
For you.
MAURICE
(takes it)
This is me.
An antsy Glenn with his shades on talks on the phone.
GLENN
Snoopy.
Glenn Michaels.
INTERCUTTING GLENN & MAURICE:
MAURICE
Studs.
Hey, son, you must be one a
them psychic friends.
I was just
thinkin' about you.
Glenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black Lincoln
Town Car and jogs to the john.
GLENN
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to
Detroit and need a place to crash.
MAURICE
You crazy, come up here?
It's fuckin
one degree outside.
GLENN
I wanna talk to you about a job.
MAURICE
Uh-huh.
GLENN
I can't really go into it right now.
I'll just tell you it's someone big.
MAURICE
Someone?
Gimme a hint.
GLENN
It's a guy you know.
MAURICE
Gimme another hint.
GLENN
It's Richard Ripley.
Maurice doesn't say a word.
GLENN (CONT'D)
You there?
MAURICE
Oh, I'm here, all right.
I'm very here.
Question is, why aren't you here?
As Foley and Buddy hurry up the front steps.
FOLEY
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
BUDDY
Cause she had her hand on her gun the
whole time, waiting to make her move.
Buddy opens the door, looks at Foley.
FOLEY
You're just jealous it was me in the
trunk with her and not you.
BUDDY
You're right.
A dozen GERIATRIC RESIDENTS sit on chairs out front as Buddy
climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm,
newspaper under the other.
An old woman comes out the door as
Buddy opens it and squints at him.
OLD WOMAN
Oh--
Are you delivering the oxygen?
BUDDY
Uh, no, ma'am.
Sorry.
Right on a marina.
Boats bobbing on the water.
MARSHALL (VO)
Is this Foley?
Karen stands there with her car keys and purse as Marshall paints
the trim on the boat.
MARSHALL
Remember, pay attention to how she
talks about Foley, her tone.
Do it
right, she'll tell you things she
wouldn't tell Burdon.
Tell her you
think he's a nice guy.
No, first tell
her about being in the trunk with him,
in the dark for half an hour, and see
how she takes it.
If she's in on it,
what does she get for all the
aggravation; cops breathing on her?
I
bet nothing.
So she still likes him
enough to stick her neck out.
You
think that's possible?
What kind of
guy is he?
KAREN
He's pretty laid back, confident.
MARSHALL
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
KAREN
Not at all.
MARSHALL
But you know he's dirty and you still
wanna see him again.
KAREN
I want to bust his ass, put him in
shackles.
MARSHALL
Maybe.
But you're also curious about
the man.
Twice last night you asked
your married boyfriend Nicolet about
him.
You were concerned, but you didn't
want to show it.
KAREN
My married boyfriend - setting him up
with that news story so you could talk
about infidelity.
I couldn't believe
it.
MARSHALL
You like the wild ones, don't you?
Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.
You
know, I've always said there's a thin
line between the cowboy cops and the
armed robbers, all those guys that
love to pack.
KAREN
Foley kidnapped me.
MARSHALL
Yeah, but you talked all the way from
GCI to the turnpike.
It sounds more
like a first date than a kidnapping.
She gives him a look.
He goes back to his painting.
MARSHALL (CONT'D)
Go talk to the ex-wife.
Adele's neighbourhood.
Near the beach.
Chino on the phone.
He
wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit...
CHINO
Oh, is this Adele?
ADELE (PHONE)
Yes, it is.
CHINO
Uh-- sorry.
Wrong number.
He hangs up, glances about, then checks the little .22 stuck in
one of his pockets.
As he then starts off down the street, we
can see the name "COLOR MY WORLD HOUSEPAINTING" on the back of
the jumpsuit.
Snow.
Everywhere.
A black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the
neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes.
MAURICE (VO)
I don't just manage fighters, or deal
product any more...
People on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black
Town Car moves past the broken-down homes, cars on blocks and
snow-covered trash.
GLENN
So you still haven't said, how you
wanna do it?
MAURICE
I'll show you, soon as I get one more
guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother,
Kenneth.
Along with White Boy there.
GLENN
What?
The car pulls to the kerb and KENNETH -- a wiry black man in a
bright yellow T-shirt and red baseball cap backward, always
seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in.
MAURICE
You get everything?
Kenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat.
Glenn stares at
it.
Something about the bag makes him uneasy.
Maybe it's the
HACKSAW that sticks partially out of the opening.
MAURICE (CONT'D)
Cool.
Kenneth, this is the man I told
you about, Glenn.
KENNETH
The one gonna help us rip off the rich
guy?
MAURICE
That's right.
GLENN
Help you...
White Boy Bob pulls out again.
Glenn looks at the two psychos
in front, then turns to Maurice.
GLENN (CONT'D)
Wait a minute.
I'm letting you in on
this, not all your friends.
MAURICE
You just ask me how we gonna do it.
That's what I'm here for, tell you
how.
We the experts.
Glenn can't believe this is happening.
MAURICE (CONT'D)
Thing I'm worried about is you.
GLENN
Me?
MAURICE
Yeah.
If you can step up and actually
do it.
Understand?
'Stead of just
talking the talk.
GLENN
Can I do what?
MAURICE
Walk in a house with me, do this cross-
dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I
used to sell to been dealin' on his
own.
GLENN
What-- when?
MAURICE
Right now, son.
GLENN
I don't have to prove shit to you.
The Ripley job is my job.
You're either
in or you're not.
You wanna pop some
crack dealer pissed you off, that's
your problem, not mine.
MAURICE
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you
don't have to give me no tone of voice,
okay?
You don't like what I'm saying,
you can get out anywhere along here
you want.
GLENN
I think you're forgetting, this is my
car.
I drove it up here.
MAURICE
Hey, shit, come on.
I say I want this
car, man, it's mine.
You go get
yourself another one.
I say I'm in on
Ripley?
I'm in, with or without your
ass.
I say I want you to come along
on another job, see if you for real or
not, guess what you gonna do?
Glenn looks at Maurice, now ice-cold behind the shades.
WHITE BOY BOB
We're here.
Glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit-
looking two-story house.
Maurice opens the gym bag, passes the
hack saw and a HAND AXE up to White Boy Bob, a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN
to Kenneth, and takes out a big .45 for himself.
MAURICE
Let's go see Eddie.
Glenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear...
RIPLEY (V.O.)
Must take balls, do what you do.
As Foley walks with Ripley across the yard.
RIPLEY
Tell me something.
What's it like,
walk in a bank with a gun, stick it
up?
FOLEY
I don't know.
I never used a gun.
RIPLEY
Really?
FOLEY
You'd be surprised what all you can
get, you ask for it the right way.
RIPLEY
(smiles)
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep
all my money in banks.
FOLEY
No?
Where do you keep it, Dick?
(Ripley smiles)
I'm talking about all those uncut
diamonds you told Glenn about.
RIPLEY
(still smiling)
I know what you're talking about.
FOLEY
You're the one with balls, Dick, say
something like that to someone like
Glenn.
Or maybe you just forgot where
you were for a minute.
RIPLEY
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn?
I mean, do you believe Glenn?
FOLEY
Of course not.
RIPLEY
Plus, even it was true, he'd still
have to figure out where I keep 'em.
FOLEY
Doesn't have to figure out shit.
You
told him you keep 'em at your house.
RIPLEY
(shrugs, big smile)
It's a big house.
Ripley sits down on one of the picnic tables, looks around the
yard.
RIPLEY (CONT'D)
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer
you in here?
FOLEY
Twenty-two months, three days, two
hours.
Why?
RIPLEY
I was just thinking that I could use a
guy like you, someone knows how to ask
for things the right way.
I'm talkin'
about when you're outta here.
I mean,
you can't rob banks for ever.
Foley looks at Ripley.
FOLEY
It's a little late for me.
RIPLEY
Hey, Jack?
Bullshit.
I didn't make
my first million until I was forty-
two.
Forty-two.
You really want to
change, it's never too late.
FOLEY
I don't know.
I'm not exactly the
nine-to-five type.
RIPLEY
Who is?
But then you gotta look at a
job as more than just work.
You gotta
look at it as peace of mind.
As
security, you know what I mean?
I got
offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston,
take your pick.
FOLEY
My ex-wife's in Miami.
It's nice down
there.
RIPLEY
No need to decide now.
Be like the
fish.
Let whatever happens happen.
FOLEY
The fish?
RIPLEY
Yeah, fish live in the present.
They
don't dwell on yesterday and they don't
worry about tomorrow.
Even when a big
fish attacks a little fish, there's no
neurosis involved.
No guilt afterward.
No whining on some fish-shrink's couch.
They just do it.
They accept.
FOLEY
I can't say that I've paid that much
attention to 'em before.
RIPLEY
The fish saved my life.
Two years
ago, I found out I had high blood
pressure.
So my doctor, he tells me
to go get an aquarium, look at the
fish every time I felt myself stressing
out.
FOLEY
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
RIPLEY
It works.
You should try it sometime.
FOLEY
The next time I walk into a bank.
Ripley shakes his head, then gets up...
RIPLEY
Think about my offer, Jack.
Foley watches him go.
BUDDY (V.O.)
Hey, Jack...
CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF FOLEY
As he turns to us.
FOLEY
What?
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE'RE INSIDE A CAR
Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red-
brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.
BUDDY
You see this one...
Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
"Fight over tuna casserole may have
spurred slaying."
Seems this woman's
live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,
complained about her tuna noodle
casserole and she shot him in the face
with a twelve-gauge.
Police found
noodles in the woman's hair and think
the guy dumped the casserole dish on
her before she shot him.
They'd been
together ten years.
FOLEY
Love is funny.
Buddy looks at him.
Notices something over Foley's shoulder.
BUDDY
Hey--
And now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car
pulls into the Kronk parking lot.
The same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier.
Now it's a CRIME SCENE.
A SMALL CROWD of neighbourhood gawkers
stand just behind the yellow tape.
A HUGE SPOTLIGHT lights up
the front yard.
Karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly-
freezing COP at the tape, working crowd control.
KAREN
I'm looking for Ray Cruz.
COP
He's inside.
(pissed)
With everybody else.
Karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk.
She pauses
to watch as two CORONER'S ASSISTANTS cover with a sheet a DEAD
BLACK WOMAN who lies just below a broken upstairs window.
As Cruz and Karen walk to his car, STROBES FLASH as press
photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene.
CRUZ
Other than we had so much fun the last
time we worked together.
You gonna
tell me why you're comin' to me instead
of the FBI?
KAREN
I report to the FBI, first thing they're
gonna do is ask me to go get some
coffee.
CRUZ
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
KAREN
No, I didn't know that.
CRUZ
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and
property now, also sex crimes and child
abuse.
KAREN
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
CRUZ
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions
are big, too.
KAREN
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had
this guy Glenn Michaels on possession
with intent but couldn't make it stick.
In his statement, Glenn said he went
up to Detroit to visit a friend and
look into job opportunities -- if you
can believe that.
CRUZ
Who was the friend?
KAREN
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known
as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
CRUZ
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.
He's a
fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray
Leonard.
Hangs out with a couple other
Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
KAREN
I'll need a last known address.
CRUZ
That's fine, but I don't want you to
talk to Miller alone.
KAREN
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer,
I'm armed.
He turns and looks at her.
CRUZ
Yes, you are.
I'll call you tomorrow
with the address.
As he gets into his car, we then:
CUT TO: A NEWSPAPER
The crime scene from the night before.
A shot of Karen and Ray
Cruz as they exit the house.
A headline reads "TRIPLE MURDER"
blah-blah-blah...
BUDDY (PHONE)
You have the paper?
REVEAL: FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Foley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the
newspaper photograph of Karen.
FOLEY
It's a terrific shot of her.
Red brick, showing its age.
Karen rings the doorbell and then
waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy
coat.
The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe
holding her arms close against the cold.
KAREN
Moselle Miller?
MOSELLE
What do you want?
KAREN
I'm looking for Maurice.
MOSELLE
You find him, tell him the dog got run
over and I'm out of grocery money.
MALE VOICE
Moselle.
Who you talking to?
MOSELLE
Lady looking for Maurice.
MALE VOICE
What's she want?
MOSELLE
Hasn't said.
KAREN
That's not Maurice?
MOSELLE
That's Kenneth, my brother.
He's
talking on the phone.
MALE VOICE
Ask what she want with him?
MOSELLE
You ask her.
Maurice's business is
none of my business.
Sounding tired or bored.
She turns from the door and walks
into the living room.
Karen steps inside, pushes the door
closed and steps into the foyer.
MALE VOICE
How do I know?
Karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and
sees Kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on
the phone...
KENNETH
The State, huh.
Who's fighting?
Karen walks into the living room, where Moselle sits on the sofa
lighting a cigarette.
MOSELLE
You like to sit down?
KAREN
Thanks.
Karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray
daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the
fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box.
KAREN (CONT'D)
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think
Maurice knows.
MOSELLE
You not with probation, one of those?
KAREN
No.
MOSELLE
You a lawyer?
KAREN
(smiles)
No, I'm not.
Maybe you know him.
Glenn Michaels?
Moselle draws on her cigarette, blows out a stream of smoke.
MOSELLE
Glenn?
No, I don't know any Glenn.
KAREN
He said he stayed here last November.
MOSELLE
Here?
In this house?
KAREN
He said he stayed with Maurice.
MOSELLE
Well, he ain't even here that much.
I
like to know where he goes, but at the
same time I don't want to know, you
understand?
KAREN
(beat)
Your dog was killed?
MOSELLE
Got run over by a car.
KAREN
What did you call it?
Moselle looks at the couch, where a MANGLED FRISBEE sits.
MOSELLE
Was a she, name Tuffy.
KAREN
(nods, then)
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
MOSELLE
I don't know -- the gym, the fights.
I know he don't miss the fights.
Having
some tomorrow night at the State
Theater.
He use to take me.
KAREN
The State Theater?
VOICE
What you want with Maurice?
Karen turns, sees Kenneth standing in the arched entrance from
the foyer.
MOSELLE
She looking for a man name of Glenn.
KENNETH
Did I ask you?
Go on out of here.
Do
something with yourself.
He waits until Moselle gets up, not saying a word, walks away
from them through the dining room.
Karen watches him come toward
her now in kind of an easy strut.
She indicates the scar over
his eye...
KAREN
You're a fighter?
KENNETH
How you know that?
KAREN
I can tell.
KENNETH
I was...
He moves his head in what might be a feint.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
Till I got my retina detached two time.
He's standing so close to her, Karen has to look up at him.
KAREN
What'd you fight, middleweight?
KENNETH
Light to super-middleweight, as my
body developed.
You go about what,
bantam?
KAREN
Flyweight.
KENNETH
You know your divisions.
You like the
fights?
Like the rough stuff?
Yeah,
I bet you do.
(moves closer)
Like to get down and tussle a little
bit?
Like me and Tuffy, before she
got run over, we use to get down on
the floor and tussle.
I say to her,
"You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat
for you."
And I give Tuffy what every
dog love best.
You know what that is?
A bone.
(real close)
I can give you a bone, too, girl.
KAREN
You're not my type.
KENNETH
Don't matter.
I let the monster out,
you gonna do what it wants.
KAREN
Just a minute.
Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair.
KENNETH
Bring your own rubbers with you?
Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip
on a golf club.
Kenneth grins at her...
KENNETHN (CONT'D)
What else you have in there, mace?
Have a whistle, different kinds of
female-protection shit?
Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face.
KAREN
I have to go, Kenneth.
She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's
like a golf club grip.
KAREN (CONT'D)
Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?
She steps aside and brushes past him.
He grabs her left wrist...
KENNETH
We gonna tussle first.
Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots
out of the grip.
She pulls an arm's length away from him and
chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking
away...
KENNETH (CONT'D)
God damn...
He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that
when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of
his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.
KENNETH (CONT'D)
What's wrong with you?
KAREN
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
And she walks out.
She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer.
Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and
comes out with a business card.
KAREN (CONT'D)
I wrote my hotel number on there -- in
case you run into Glenn.
Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe.
Karen smiles
at her and walks out the door.
It's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front.
As Foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two
guards.
He picks himself up.
He kicks at the guards, who wave
him off, go back inside.
Foley then starts down the steps, pauses as he sees...
THE BANK ACROSS THE STREET
The one from the opening.
Foley looks at it a moment, then
calmly starts to take off his tie, drops it in the gutter as he
starts across the street...
CUT TO:
The sun is out.
The snow has stopped falling.
A white blanket
covers everything.
Glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot.
Karen exits right after, watches him get into the Town Car.
Karen looks across the street at the theatre, sees people
leaving.
A few seconds later, she steps behind a car and watches
as Buddy and Foley pull into the lot.
It's snowing as Maurice, White Boy Bob, Kenneth, Buddy, and
Foley pile into the back of a van, the name of some plumbing
and heating company on the side.
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're watching from inside Karen's
car.
She waits for the van to pull away, then follows.
As Karen's car does a 360 in the ice and snow.
As a pissed-off Karen gets out of her car, watches the van
disappear.
KAREN
Shit --
As the van creeps by one way, then the other, then pulls into
the driveway.
VAN - RIPLEY'S HOUSE
All five of them in the back end of the van now, bumping into
each other until Maurice lets White Boy out the rear end, leaving
the doors open enough so he can watch.
He then racks the slide
on a .45.
MAURICE
"An army .45 will stop all jive."
Huey P. said that.
BUDDY
You think he was talking about walking
into people's houses when he said it?
Maurice looks at Buddy.
Buddy holds his gaze.
Then the coach
lights on either side of the front entrance come on.
MAURICE
(pulls his mask down)
Get ready to go skiing.
Now the front door opens...
MAURICE (CONT'D)
Here we go.
We catch a glimpse of a WOMAN in the doorway, arms folded over
her bathrobe as White Boy gives her a push and steps inside the
house with her.
Maurice is out of the truck and Kenneth, with a shotgun, is
scrambling to be next.
Buddy catches him by his jacket collar
and holds him squirming until Foley is out.
The minute Kenneth's feet hit the driveway he turns the 12-gauge
on Buddy, still in the truck.
Foley takes the barrel in one
hand and shoves it straight up in Kenneth's face.
FOLEY
Go on in the house before you get hurt.
Kenneth puts his face up close to Foley's and stares at him
good before going inside.
Foley turns to Buddy...
FOLEY (CONT'D)
There's still time, take me up on my
offer.
BUDDY
I'm not leaving you alone with these
assholes.
As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm.
As Karen drives slowly past the house.
White Boy Bob emerges
with an armload of steaks and sets them on the front steps.
MAURICE
White Boy!
Get your ass up here!
White Boy Bob hurries back into the house.
Karen sees the muzzle flashes in the upstairs window and quickly
gets out of the car.
As Karen cautiously makes her way towards the front door.
A now-freezing Karen hugs a retaining wall, watches as Foley
and Buddy emerge from the house.
AT THE VAN
As Buddy leans under the dash.
Foley looks up at the house
where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window, hear
the faint pumping of the music.
We hear the VAN START.
BUDDY
Okay.
Buddy straightens up, looks at Foley.
BUDDY (CONT'D)
Come on.
FOLEY
Shit.
BUDDY
What?
FOLEY
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't
they.
BUDDY
From the looks of those boys, the
Ripper too.
FOLEY
And then they'll kill 'em.
BUDDY
At least.
Foley looks at the diamonds in the bag.
FOLEY
We made it, didn't we?
BUDDY
All you gotta do is get in.
Again Foley looks at the diamonds, then...
FOLEY
I'm going back inside.
BUDDY
I'll go with you.
Foley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it...
FOLEY
No, you dump the van, meet me at the
airport.
I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
BUDDY
Jack --
FOLEY
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about
to go down, you'll be on the phone
with your sister for a month.
Let me
do this part alone.
Buddy just looks at him.
FOLEY (CONT'D)
I'm saying this isn't your problem.
Far as I'm concerned, we're square.
Foley turns to go.
BUDDY
Hey...
Buddy hands him his gun.
Foley takes it, stuffs it in the back
of his pants, and then turns back to the house.
FOLEY
Now get outta here.
KAREN
As she watches Foley go back inside.
A moment later, the van
pulls out of the driveway.
Karen makes a decision, starts for
the side of the house...
As Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive...
As Buddy pulls the van into an alley.
He jumps out, jogs back
to the street and hails a cab...
The sun is out.
The sky is clear.
KAREN (VO)
They don't know yet if they want to
bring him up on the homicides.
The Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black
government van waits.
The Marshal helps Foley inside.
FEDERAL MARSHAL
Have a nice trip.
(looks OS)
I'll get the other one.
As Foley sits down, stares at the floor.
He looks depressed.
We hear the front door open, then close.
KAREN (OS)
Jack?
He looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that
separates the front from the back.
KAREN
I got you a present, something for the
road.
She pushes A ZIPPO THROUGH the grate.
KAREN (CONT'D)
I have to take it away, though, soon
as the ride's over.
Before Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once
more and the Marshal helps ANOTHER PRISONER -- a black man with
a shaved head -- into the back of the van.
FEDERAL MARSHAL
Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry.
An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the
door then gets in up front with Karen.
FOLEY
Hejira?
What kinda name is that?
HEJIRA
Islamic.
FOLEY
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
HEJIRA
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed
from Mecca in 622.
FOLEY
The flight?
HEJIRA
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me
the name.
FOLEY
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
HEJIRA
For a time.
FOLEY
Meaning?
HEJIRA
Meaning time came, I left.
FOLEY
You busted out?
HEJIRA
I prefer to call it an exodus from an
undesirable place.
FOLEY
(interested now)
And how long was it before they caught
up with you?
HEJIRA
That time?
FOLEY
There were others.
HEJIRA
Yeah.
That was the ninth.
FOLEY
(really interested)
The ninth?
HEJIRA
Ten, you count the prison hospital in
Ohio I walked away from.
FOLEY
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
HEJIRA
Hejira.
FOLEY
And so now you're off to Glades.
HEJIRA
Apparently, yeah.
I was supposed to
leave last night with the lady marshal,
but for some reason she wanted to wait.
FOLEY
(looks at Karen)
She did, huh.
HEJIRA
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in
one van.
FOLEY
Yeah, could be.
Or maybe she thought
we'd have a lot to talk about.
HEJIRA
Like what?
FOLEY
I don't know.
(then)
It's a long way down to Florida.
Foley glances at her, then turns back to Heiira Henry and
considers the guy; a smile on Foley's face, his spirits a little
higher than when he first sat down, as we then...
CUT TO BLACK.
