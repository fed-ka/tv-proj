      Beautiful old world -- CAMERA MOVES UP A STAIRCASE and finds  
      Security Agent MITCH YUSON (30s, military, wears a suit), 
      making the rounds.  Ahead: a hallway secured by laser grids 
      and motion detectors.  Production Note:  There is a security 
      camera in this hall (CAM 3).

      Yuson inserts an ID card into a keypad and presses his 
      thumbprint against a biometric sensor.  A positive ID starts 
      a disarming process: BEEP.  5... 4... 3... 2... 1...   

      The laser grid disappears, the motion sensors shut down and 
      as Yuson enters the hallway, we see what the heavy security 
      is about: priceless artifacts from around the world - wall 
      paintings, exotic sculptures and encased jewels.  

      Yuson arrives at the end of the hallway, reactivates the 
      security system and walks off.  BEEP.  5...    

      TILT UP TO REVEAL --  

      Through the skylight above him, an ominous masked figure 
      stares down.  This is SILENT MASK. 

      OFF suction cups being attached to glass --           NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     2. 




      Silent Mask rappels down on a cord (wearing a sport back 
      pack)... racing the five seconds as he moves to the alarm 
      keypad and connects a wrist/PDA... He keys a code, blocking 
      the security initiation: Alarm Canceled.  

      A second figure - SILENT MASK 2 (SM2) slides down the cord.  
      He eyes a wall painting, salivating, but Silent Mask motions-  

                                  SILENT MASK
                    Not what we re here for.

      OFF Silent Mask resuming his hacking into the security 
      system...


      Mitch Yuson before a 40  LCD split into (6-9) screen panels 
      (black and white images). One monitor s image goes to static, 
      causing Yuson to zero in.  PRODUCTION NOTE: We see a rack of 
      shotguns behind Yuson. 

                                  MITCH YUSON
                    What the... 

      The next monitor does the same.  Every monitor goes to 
      static...

      Yuson quickly grabs a phone as-


      Silent Mask s wrist/PDA blinks a message: Security Cameras 
      and Phones Disabled.  Silent Mask detaches the PDA from the 
      alarm keypad and moves down the hallway.  SM2 follows.  

      Silent Mask moves past the art and jewelry...


      ...down a staircase... doesn t see -- Production Note:  There 
      is a Consulate security camera (CAM 4) on this staircase.

                                  MITCH YUSON (O.S.)
                    Don t move!

      ON Mitch Yuson-

      Aiming a 12 gauge shotgun at Silent Mask!  Ready to shoot.

      Silent Mask doesn t move.  Instead, he looks past the unaware 
      Mitch Yuson- 

      -at SM2 who moves up from behind.  Yuson senses it, starts to 
      turn (taking his aim away from Silent Mask)-

      -but SM2 hits him with a taser!  Yuson s shotgun BLASTS out, 
        obliterating a vase of flowers before he drops.  OFF the 
      Silent Mask Crew, no one in their way... 


      A crime scene now:  LAPD and FOUR DS AGENTS (Diplomatic 
      Security).  DON and DAVID walk up, met by DS Special Agent 
      BROWNER DUNN (50s, old military, in a suit like Mitch Yuson).  
      Production Note:  As they walk and talk, we MOVE with them 
      from outside to inside of the Consulate.

      Don, David and Browner Dunn watch recorded surveillance on a 
      monitor.  Like before, the footage goes to static.

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    They took out the main cameras...

                    ...but hopefully not an attention to detail. 
                              (then)
                    I checked with the neighbors.  Their 
                    garage camera covers the hall window.

      Nikki plugs the laptop into a monitor, cues different 
      footage...  PRODUCTION NOTE:  We see footage on both the 
      laptop and the main monitor. 

      ON THE LAPTOP -  Distorted images through a window: the 
      standoff between Mitch Yuson (the Security Agent) and the 
      Silent Mask Crew.  Yuson s dropped by tasers and carried 
      (fireman s) off camera, disappearing down a side corridor... 
      (Note: The camera isn t trained on the window - it captures 
      the window while covering the neighbor s property)

                    That s Yuson...

                                  NIKKI
                    ...But there s more.

      Nikki fast forwards and we see...

      ON THE LAPTOP - The Silent Mask Crew exits the side corridor, 
      walking in the opposite direction - NO SIGN of Mark Yuson...

                                  DON
                    So where d they leave him?          NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     4A. 




      Browner Dunn in tow, Don, David and Nikki trace the path of 
      the Silent Mask Crew, looking for Yuson behind a door, under 
      a pool table... 

                                  DAVID
                    According to the footage, this is the 
                    only place they could have gone. 

      ...finding that the corridor has a dead end.

                                  DON

      Everyone listens.  Faint taps are heard from behind the wall 
      painting, along with the MUFFLED SOUNDS OF A HUMAN VOICE...

      David and Nikki look for hidden levers.  Nikki flips light 
      switches.  David checks a line of books.  He discovers: 

      A mounted bust.  Slightly crooked.  He adjusts it.  The huge 
      painting rolls back to reveal...

                                        ACT ONE


      On the board, photos of the crime scene (opened skylight, 
      disabled alarm keypad) and wide shots of the vault room shoe 
      collection.  Don, David and Nikki regroup.

                                  DAVID
                      I understand stealing gold.  I can 
                    respect stealing art.  But, who pulls 
                    a heist for shoes?

                                  DON
                    Who keeps them in a vault? 

                                  NIKKI
                    This Consul Nespola dude s gotta be a 
                    hard core shoe collector.  Some of 
                    these guys will stand in line for 
                    days for a pair of  kicks. 

                                  DAVID
                    You re kidding.  For shoes? 

                                  DON
                    Says the guy with 35,000 comic books.

      Nikki hits a remote to bring up-

      ON THE BIG SCREEN - wide shot photos of the vault shoes.

      [PRODUCTION NOTE: Nikki can not point to shoes as she talks.]

                                  NIKKI
                    He s got dead stock Waffles, 
                      Micropacers, So-Cal Exclusives...  A 
                      collection like this is worth 
                    millions. 

      Don and David look at Nikki, dubious.  She knows it seems 
      ridiculous, but-

                                  NIKKI (cont'd)
                    Kicks are status symbols.  You live 
                    in Malibu, you drive a Maserati.  
                    Live on Slauson, you wear Jordans. 

                                  DON
                    What are you, a sneakerologist?

      Don keys up different photos of Nespola s collection.

                                  DON
                    They took one pair...

                                  NIKKI
                    Judging from what they left behind, 
                    they re something special. 

                                  DAVID
                    Thieves aren t complicated.  Someone 
                    hired them, or they re heading for 
                    the black market.  

                                  NIKKI
                    Either way, that probably gives us 24 
                    hours before the sneakers get moved.  

      LIZ WARNER enters, crosses to them.

                    It s the new stock market.  Oil s

                    But, before I was Consul, I was a kid 
                    who couldn t afford sneakers.  Now I 
                    can, so I do.

                                  DON

                    I know Primers.  My brother wanted a 
                    pair when we were kids.  Parents paid 
                    rent instead.

                                  DON
                    What s so special about this pair?

                    So? 

      Nespola looks at Don, blown away by his ignorance.

                    That means I paid 250,000 dollars for 
                    these at auction.  Know how much

                    I know everything about Primers.  
                    They started with  Primer  Nelson.  
                    Busted ankle ended his days in the 
                    league, so he made kicks to prevent 
                    injuries to others.  Mix tech with 
                    fashion and Primers became a 
                      phenomenon. 

                                  DON

                    single to buy a pair of Primers.

      Nespola s - resembling a shrine more than a display room.  A 
      monument to  Primer  Nelson.  Framed (clear lucite) 1975 
      basketball card (featuring a 27 year old Jason  Primer  
      Nelson wearing a  Skyscraper  basketball uni), and a

                    I felt cheated, so I sent a message.  
                    As you see, I m more intimidating 
                    through email than I am in person.  
                    It s not about money for me.

                    They say love is putting on a fresh 
                    pair every day?  That s me.  Ask 
                    around.  My reputation s nice.  Can t 
                    say that for Nespola.

                    I read about that.  The shoes washed 
                    up on shores from Oregon to Hawaii in 
                    a pattern depending on the brand and 
                    whether they were left or rights.

                      Counterfeiters.  They used a mold 
                    from an authentic pair to make 
                      knockoffs.

                                  NIKKI
                    Any idea what Diddums was after?

                                  LIZ
                    No one knows, but they ve seen him 
                    before.  He met with their bosses.

                                  DAVID

      Liz points to NADROJ RIA sitting on the ground (20s, fierce 
      eyes, prison hard).  He averts his gaze.


      David and Nikki sit across from Ria, who fidgets - uneasy.   

                                  RIA
                     (slight Albanian accent)

                    Really?  You know Albania, right?

      Ria thinks this over.  Rock and a hard place.  Then-

                                  RIA
                    I d rather do prison here than go

                                  DAVID
                    Then start confessing.

      David places Lee Diddums  MUGSHOT on the table.

                                  RIA
                    Diddums stole a pair of Final Edition 
                    Primers from some rich guy.  We paid 
                    20,000 to borrow the shoes for a few 
                    hours...

                    We can knock out 100 counterfeits in 
                    a day.  But the other part was 
                    Zetroc s idea.

                                  DAVID
                    Other part?

                    To switch the pairs on Diddums, give 
                    him counterfeits...  

                                  NIKKI
                      ...Because, naturally, one good theft 
                    deserves another...

                                  RIA
                    Zetroc said he could auction off the 
                    real pair.

                                  DAVID
                    But Diddums killed him first.

      Ria nods.

                                  DAVID (cont'd)
                    So, why was Diddums at the warehouse 
                    when we arrived?

                                  NIKKI 
                          (realizing)
                    The Primers Zetroc had on his feet 
                    were knockoffs, too.  He came back 
                    for the real ones.  

                                  RIA
                    We might be crooks, but we re not 
                    stupid.  

                                  DAVID
                    So where are the originals?   

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      David, Nikki and La-La eye the stack of Primers on the floor.

                    Gotta hand it to him - not easy to

                      Especially when the only guy who 
                    knows which is which is dead. 

      La-La lifts a Primers sneaker, examines it closely.

                                  DAVID
                    Kind of funny, considering a real 
                    pair costs ten times as much. 

                                  NIKKI
                    Tried weighing them.  Every sneaker s

      Charlie lifts a rubber stress ball from a desk, tosses it to 
      Larry, who catches it.

      Larry lifts a metal ball paperweight, holding it side by side 
      with the rubber stress ball.

      Larry tosses both balls at Charlie, who didn t expect them 
      and ducks...

                    Throwing ability aside, the 
                      Hyperspectral sensors collect 
                      information as a set of images. These 
                    images are then combined to form a 3-

                    to the authentic pair.

      Charlie removes an authentic Primers from La-La s suitcase.  
      Larry lifts a Primers from the bin labeled:  Warehouse 
      Source. 

      And places them inside the Hyperspectral imaging machine.

      ON A LAPTOP, we see a display of what the shoes look like

      A SHORT TIME LAPSE MONTAGE- 

      Charlie, Larry and Alan s (continuing to do grunt work) 
      actions speed up as they test shoes, setting fakes into a bin 
      labeled Counterfeits.  

      As the bin fills up... 

      THE MONTAGE ENDS

      Charlie and Alan work in the background, while Larry sits 
      with Liz, looking on (away from Charlie and Alan who cannot 
      hear them)...

                                  LARRY

                      I congratulate and commend you at the 
                    same time.  Decisions that take us 
                    away from family are never easy.  

      Liz digests this.  A beat, then -

                                  LIZ
                    It s not that hard.  My older

                      Department...  Younger brother s in

      Larry isn t sure how to react.

                      Certainly, if ever you need a

      ENTER AUDIENCE VISION

      We re inside of a pinball machine - flashy lights, springs 
      and levers.  A PLUNGER shoves the pinball onto the playfield.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     51.

      All flipper doors are open, so the ball can go anywhere...

                    Think of the Primers as a pinball.  
                    The number of interested buyers is 
                    already limited.  The level of risk 
                    involved with purchasing the shoes 
                    tells us where the bumpers are. *

      The pinball rolls toward a flipper, but it closes, rerouting 
      the ball as it ricochets violently.  The flippers and bumpers 
      morph into obstacles - police, thieves, etc.

                    And with the Primers, extremely high *
                    priced, high profiled and high risk 
                      considering they re stolen property...

      Eventually, all flippers close, forcing the pinball to roll 
      back home, settling beside the plunger.

                                    CHARLIE (cont d)
                    ...the number of possible avenues - 
                    of possible buyers - considering all 
                    factors - becomes extremely limited.

                    In fact, the buyer with the least 
                    amount of risk and greatest ability 
                    to purchase is also the person we 
                    might least expect.

      Don and Nikki confront Randall Nespola who shoots pool...  In 
      the background, his vault door is being worked on by a 
      TECHNICIAN in a white jumpsuit (using a PDA and wires).  The 
      shoes inside the vault have been moved, so the vault is empty.

                    You re right.  But the Primers are 
                    coming with us, which means they ll 
                    be in evidence...

                                  DON

      Nespola looks like a broken man.  Finally, he relents, sets 
      down his pool stick...

                    No scuffs on the shoes, please?  Make 
                    sure whoever handles them in evidence 
                    knows what they re doing.  Keep them
