          RIIIP!  Bruce tears the brown paper away to reveal...


          A PAINTING OF A GIRL NAMED CHLOE

            A captivating young woman, 20-ish, brown-haired, lies on
          an antique sofa in a white dress.  Her arms are up and
          behind her, as if she tossed herself down for a nap.

          It is NIGHT.  Through a nearby window, a glow of moonlight
          hits her.  (See Wyeth's "Helga" paintings.)

          Chloe looks at us... but almost through us.  And through...

          Johnny, who is transfixed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's incredible.

                                        BRUCE
                        You have no idea. 
                                  (pronounced "Line")
                        This is an Andrew Lyne original.

          As he says this, Bruce points out an "AL" in the bottom
          right corner of the frame.  Johnny comes out of his moment:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Lyne...  Isn't he from Maine?

                                        BRUCE
                        Part of the artists' colony down
                        on the coastal line.  Big-time
                          recluse.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Long fingernails and bad hygiene?

                                        BRUCE
                        He's a recluse, not a hermit. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds like he was a patient. 

                                        BRUCE
                          Actually, a subject.  Art history --
                        Junior year of college.  The man's
                          a legend, Johnny.  Painted solid
                        for seven years, then stopped.

          Bruce gets closer to the girl's image, studies it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Made his name on a series of
                          paintings called "Daughter". 
                          Inspired by his girl...
                                  (recalling)
                        Think her name was Julia.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why'd he stop?

                                        BRUCE
                        She died.  Drowned or something. 
                        But this isn't her.  At least, I
                        don't remember this painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's working again.

                                        BRUCE
                        If he is, that's a big deal.  I
                        mean, like, huge.  Question is,
                        who sent this and why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  But it's gonna
                        look great over the mantel.

          Johnny goes to move the painting, but -- WHOOOSH!


33A VISION - CONTINUOUS

          When he looks down, Johnny's hands and arms have taken on
          the color and character of Andrew Lyne's artwork.  It's
          Johnny in brushstrokes.

          The BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT overtakes Johnny and....

                                                                              FLASH TO: 



          Johnny is in the painting.  Same wooden-walled room with
          peeling paint.  Chloe on the sofa in front of him. 
          Everything remains in brushstroke effect....

          Chloe shifts on the sofa.  Smiles.  Poses.

          But as Johnny gets closer, she looks straight at him. 
          Her eyes go wide...

          And then they are still.  Deathly still.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TEASER - 2/1/05 - PINK  4.


    4CONTINUED:4

          A spot of blood appears on the front of her white dress.

          Johnny freezes.  What's happening?  Where's the blood
          coming from?

            Suddenly, blood trickles down Chloe's forehead.  It 

          Dabbles onto her dress... joining the previous stain.

          Her skin goes ASHEN....

          And then the SUN is in the window, NOT the moon.  Night
          becomes day.

          Johnny looks up.  The SUNLIGHT is BLISTERING.  Johnny
          tries to shield himself, but it's too bright.  BURNING. 
          WASHING OUT, and...  

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:



          He sets it down, emotionally sucker-punched.  He takes a
          moment to nearly touch the image of Chloe....

                                        JOHNNY
                        We have to find her, Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think she's going to die.



          Johnny and Bruce move through bustle to Walt's office.

                                        BRUCE
                        We're wasting our time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll get him to listen.

                                        BRUCE
                        And he'll say what he always says. 
                        'I need more than visions, Johnny.'

          They are cut off by Walt.  On his way out.

                        Walt, I know I've had some weird
                        ones over the years, but you gotta
                        hear me out on this.

                                        WALT
                        Sure, but let's walk and talk. 
                        Gotta make it down to the coastal
                        line.

                                        BRUCE
                        Where?

                        Some crazy old artist...

                        Andrew Lyne.  Claims his daughter's
                          missing.

          Johnny and Bruce trade looks, and we...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:


          An ocean of Chloe imagery -- she's in every one of Lyne's
          paintings.  The studio is a classic artist's space, with
          clutter and paint splatter all about.  Lyne's images of
          Chloe feature her in rustic scenes, evocative, not photo-
          realistic.  Blurry focus, muted tones.  Like Wyeth with a
          dash of Monet.

          REVEAL Bruce, standing across from the paintings.  Slightly
          in awe.  Johnny and Walt enter behind him. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Check this, man.  He really is
                          painting again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We figured that out.

                                        LYNE (O.S.)
                        Make yourself comfortable,
                        gentlemen.

          Bruce hears the voice, gets slightly tense.

                                        WALT
                                (to Bruce)
                        No autographs.

          Lyne enters.   

                                        BRUCE
                        Mr. Lyne.  It's an honor. 
                                (shaking hands)
                        Name's Bruce.  I'm a friend of
                          Johnny's.  Studied your work in
                          college.

                                        LYNE
                        Ah.  You should have gotten a
                        real education.

          Lyne puts the rusted lamp with his clutter.

                          Actually, I'm an occupational
                          therapist by trade, but I have
                        many diverse interests, fine art
                        being one of them....

          Bruce trails off as he catches a glare from Walt.

                                        WALT
                        Mr. Lyne.  How long has Chloe
                        been missing?  

                                        LYNE
                        Nearly three days.  Feels like
                        weeks.

          Johnny's eyes are on Chloe in the paintings:

                                        JOHNNY
                        How old is she?

                                        LYNE
                        Barely twenty.

                                        WALT
                        She's no longer a minor.  Which
                        means there's not much I can do. 
                        Or you, for that matter.

                                        LYNE
                        It's not that she left.  It's who
                        she might have left with.  Her
                        friends are, well... I'm concerned. 

          Johnny is about to touch a painting, but--

          A NOISE offscreen.  Through some of the clutter: NORA
          COLLINS, 40, taskmaster, assistant, works behind a canvas
          in a corner of the studio.  She uses a large brush with
          white paint.  She wears a stained apron, too.

                                        NORA
                        Sorry. 

                                        LYNE
                        It's alright, Nora. 
                                (introducing)
                        My assistant, Miss Collins.

                        Please.  I won't interrupt.

          Johnny sees her canvas.  A painting half-covered in white.

                                (to Lyne)
                          Starting over?

                                        NORA
                          Actually, we're re-priming the
                        canvas.  Mr. Lyne didn't love the
                        first draft. 

          Guess that makes sense -- but then Johnny's attention
          moves past the canvas...and a realization: The wooden
          walls of the studio.  Ramshackle.  Paint peeling.  And
          there's a window.  This is....


          THE PAINTING SPACE

          where the TEASER painting was created.  Below the window,
          Johnny spots... a sofa.  Same one as in the painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The painting I received -- this
                        is where Chloe posed for you.

                        One of our first efforts.  And
                        one of her favorites.  

          Johnny goes toward it.  There's some clutter in the way.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Nora)
                        May I?

                        Please.

          Nora gets some things out of his way.  Among them, a rack
          of dresses.  Johnny looks them over.

                                        JOHNNY
                        These are Chloe's?

                        Mr. Lyne bought them for her. 
                        For the paintings.

                        There was blood on it.

                        I see.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  Sometimes I share too
                        much.

                                        NORA
                                (finds white dress)
                        Here.

          Before she hands it over, she trades a look with Lyne.  A
          little weirded out.  Lyne nods, it's okay.  Nora gives
          Johnny the dress, and the instant he touches it--

                                                                                FLASH TO:


  1212MATCH, MOVE MORPH AROUND JOHNNY - VISION

          Everyone else disappears and Johnny is in the same spot. 
          Except now Johnny is in a paint-splattered T-shirt and
          jeans -- he is Lyne. 

          He is joined by Chloe, wearing the white dress from the
            painting.  She sits on the couch.  Johnny/Lyne stops her.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        Let's do it this way, kiddo.

          He positions her arms above and behind her.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        You're hanging out.  Like a lazy
                        girl on a summer's day.

                                        CHLOE
                                (laughs)
                        Okay.  But I'm not lazy.

          Johnny/Lyne goes to his waiting canvas.  Grabs a brush. 
          He's about to start, but--

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        It's been so long.  I'm not sure
                        I have it anymore.

                                        CHLOE
                        It's going to be amazing.

          Johnny/Lyne smiles, starts working.  Pollock-like
          intensity, focus... and style.  He is driven.  He is Lyne.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - ONE - 2/1/05 - PINK  13.

          He stops for a second.  His daughter smiles at him.

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:


  1313LYNE'S STUDIO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Lyne, intrigued, waits for a response. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Lyne)
                        Must be exciting.

                                        LYNE
                        What's that, Mister Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To be painting again.  Maybe even
                          overwhelming.

          Johnny has struck a nerve with Lyne.

                                        LYNE
                        It was like living in the dark,
                        those years after Julia passed. 
                        You might say I was wandering the
                        beach with an old rusty lantern. 
                        Chloe helped me find my way.

                                        WALT
                        How did she come back into your
                        life?

                                        LYNE
                        I'd been sending money since she
                        was an infant.  Chloe's mother
                        only informed her of my existence
                        in the last few years.  She located
                        me and we were reunited.

                                        WALT
                        Could Chloe have gone back to be
                        with her mother?

                                        LYNE
                        Dear God, I hope not.  Her mother's
                        dead.  Cancer.

          Johnny remains focused on Chloe in a painting:

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's your muse.

    13CONTINUED:13

                                        LYNE
                        She is everything.
                                (re: paintings)
                        In my younger days, I painted
                        still lifes, Mr. Smith.  It was
                        only after my first portrait, of
                        my daughter Julia, that anyone
                        took notice.  But I lost her.  I
                        don't intend to lose Chloe.

          Johnny stares at an image.  Chloe seems to look at him. 
          It only makes his determination stronger:

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll need something else that
                        belongs to her.



          Rustic landscapes -- but abstract and modernist.  HARSH
          ANGLES.  Johnny and Walt move among the drawings, torn
          pages taped to walls or part of open sketch books.  They
          are the main decor of Chloe's room, which is tastefully
            shabby-chic, but with a sparse feel.

          Johnny is about to touch one of the drawings, but --

                                        LYNE
                        Before you 'see' something, I
                        should  make a confession -- Chloe
                        and I weren't always on good terms. 
                        Her mother and I never were.  The
                        classic broken family I'm afraid. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          I understand.

          Johnny notices a corner of a sketch.  Initialed: "CG".

                                        JOHNNY
                        C.G.?

                                        LYNE
                        Chloe uses her mother's maiden
                        name, Gelman.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        To not compete with her famous
                        father.

          Johnny moves around the room, touching Chloe's work.  The
          sketches give him nothing. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - ONE - 2/1/05 - PINK  15.

          But when Johnny touches the double-door on the closet --



          Chloe is suddenly there... And Johnny is beside her.  She
          dials her cell phone -- at the same time she yanks open
          the closet and finds a suitcase. 

          Lyne comes to the door -- and she immediately hits "END." 
          We're in an argument from Chloe's past -- a loud one. 

                                        LYNE
                        Where could you possibly go?

                                        CHLOE
                          Anywhere but here.

                                        LYNE
                        You have no money, Chloe -- and
                        you won't get a single penny from
                        me... not a single penny!

                                        CHLOE
                        Keep your money.  I'm leaving.

                                        LYNE
                        We haven't finished our work.

          But Chloe begins to fill the suitcase.  Seeing how serious
          she is, Lyne changes his tack:

                                        LYNE
                        Chloe, please. 

          Chloe takes the slightest pause -- but forces herself to
          keep packing.  And she's done.  She is heading out, but
          stops to grab her cell phone. 

          Johnny's focus turns to the phone -- and suddenly, the
          VISION REWINDS.  Chloe SPEEDS BACK to the start of the
          VISION, holding up her cell phone to dial.  FREEZE VISION. 
          Johnny looks over her shoulder at --


          THE CELL PHONE SCREEN - CONTACT READS: "DYLAN"



          Johnny releases the closet door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who's Dylan?

                        Chloe's classmate.

                        You said you were worried about
                        her friends.  Why?

                        Dylan deals drugs.  Nothing
                          substantial, just enough to pay
                        rent and tuition.

          Johnny studies some of Chloe's art.

                        Young people.  Modernist garbage. 
                        It's all... surface.  Nothing
                          underneath. 

          ON the jarring, modernist image....



          TOM GRAYDON, 45, sharp talker, sharp dresser, is on the
          phone at the desk of his sleek but understated gallery. 
          Even for an art dealer, Graydon is a mid-grade salesmen
          in a high-grade world.  There's an air of schmooze.

                                        GRAYDON (CONT'D)
                        You have my word as a gentleman. 
                          Absolutely.

          He hangs up.  The door opens behind him.

                        Thomas Graydon?

          Without looking, Graydon holds his hand to his head, in
          mock psychic mode.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Lemme guess.  The enigmatic Johnny
                        Smith.
                                (spins around)
                          Correct!  I guess you're not the
                        only psychic in town.

          Johnny has instant dislike for this guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You heard I was helping Mr. Lyne.

                        Spoke to Andrew this morning.  He
                        was impressed.  "A young man of
                          infinite vision," I think he said.

          Graydon shakes Bruce's hand -- but stops at Johnny's.

                                        GRAYDON

                        Can you tell me if there's any
                        loose change in my sofa cushions?

          Johnny shakes his hand.  Small WHOOSH.

                        And you are....

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's an art critic.  You seen
                        Chloe, Mr. Graydon?

                                        GRAYDON
                        Not since she broke her father's
                        heart.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure about that?

          Johnny looks past Graydon -- to a modernist piece on the
          wall.  Very angular.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This looks an awful lot like her
                        work.

          Graydon seems apprehensive.  Which is Johnny's cue to go
          over to Chloe's art.  And touch it.

                                                                              WHOOSH TO:

          discussion in progress.

                                        GRAYDON
                        That would look great in my
                          gallery.

                                        CHLOE
                        Forget it.  I just want what I
                        was promised.  It's my money.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Did you ask him? 

                                        CHLOE
                        He told me it wouldn't be a
                          problem.
                                (then)
                        He said to ask you.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Well, everything is negotiable.

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:



          Johnny releases the painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Money's a recurring theme with
                        Chloe, isn't it?
                                (off Graydon's look)
                        You fought about it.

                                        GRAYDON
                        We had a conversation.

          Johnny just looks at him.  Then--

                                        GRAYDON
                        She wanted part of her inheritance
                        before she took off.

                                        BRUCE
                        But that's not up to Dad, is it?

                                        GRAYDON
                        You must have a name. 
                                (back to Johnny)
                        Mr. Lyne put me in charge of his
                          finances ten years ago. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        So you gave her nothing.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Not much to give.  Lyne lives on
                        that spread because he owns it
                          outright.  Everything else is
                          leveraged to the moon. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Who's fault is that?

                                        GRAYDON
                        The new daughter paintings are
                        Lyne's first significant work in
                        years.  They're going to make him
                        a very wealthy man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you?

                                        GRAYDON
                        It's a team effort, isn't it?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (writing it down)
                        You hear from her, that's my
                        number.

          As they go:

                                        GRAYDON (CONT'D)
                          Careful, Johnny Smith.  Chloe's
                        not what she seems.

          And we're....



          ...ON Chloe's eyes, in the painting Johnny was captivated
          by in the Teaser.  Chloe on the sofa, under the window,
          moonlit night.  Johnny hangs up his cordless phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I keep tryin' her cell.  She's
                        not picking up.

          Bruce is here, having opened some coffee table books about
          Lyne around the room.

                                        BRUCE
                        The first cycle of daughter
                          paintings were estimated to be
                        worth around twenty million. 
                                (re: painting)
                        He could see some serious cash
                        for this bunch.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: Chloe)
                        Maybe she sent it to me.

                                        BRUCE
                        Lyne did say it's one her
                        favorites.  But why play games? 
                        If she wants your help, she can
                        pick up the phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe she's afraid.  I think she's
                        trying to tell me something.

                                        BRUCE
                        What? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure.

          It's enough to make Johnny approach the painting again. 
          This time, he doesn't grab the frame, he touches the actual
          paint.  The BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT moves up his arm and
            overtakes Johnny, and he's....



          But this time, Johnny wears paint-splattered T-shirt and
          jeans.  Lyne garb.  Johnny approaches Chloe on the sofa. 
          He's got a paintbrush in his hand.

          The BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT fades away. 

          Blood appears again.  Flowing down her face.  Horrifying. 
          And just as before....

            MOONLIGHT becomes SUNLIGHT in the window.  Blinding.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - ONE - 2/1/05 - PINK  24.

          Suddenly..  .Johnny/Lyne hears SEAGULLS.  And there's
          water at Johnny's feet.  In the room.  Like tide coming
          into the house.  Weird.

          And finally, Johnny feels something in his hand.  It's
          not the paintbrush. 

          Johnny has a LARGE ROCK in his hand.

          With BLOOD on it.  He raises it, SWINGS at Chloe and--

                                                                      SMASH BACK TO:



          Johnny comes out of the vision.

                                        BRUCE
                        What'd you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw Chloe die.
                                (then)
                        I was the killer, Bruce.  And
                        just like in my other vision, I
                        was....

                                        BRUCE
                        You were what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was Andrew Lyne.  I think Chloe's 
                        father is going to kill her.

          Bruce reacts, and....

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                              ACT TWO

          FADE IN:


          Johnny and Bruce are across from Walt, who has some files
          open.  Johnny looks a little tired.

                                        WALT
                                (not buying)
                        He's going to kill his own
                          daughter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was standing over her, Walt. 
                                (working it through)
                        I was painting her -- I was wearing
                        his clothes.

                                        BRUCE
                        It doesn't make sense.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (taken aback)
                        I saw them argue.  Maybe Lyne
                        threatened her.  What else could
                        spook Chloe enough to make her
                        take off?

                                        WALT
                        I don't know, but wherever she
                        went, she's gone.  I had Roscoe
                        check out the bus station.  She
                        didn't buy a ticket, didn't show
                        up on security video.  Nothing.
                                (re: files)
                        And her college file.  No emergency
                          contacts except her dead mother. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Wait a second -- maybe daddy did
                          threaten her. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You just said it didn't make sense.

                                        BRUCE
                        Not to us -- but to crazy artist
                        guy.  Think about it.  Lyne's
                        career was made by these portraits. 
                        After he lost the first daughter,
                        he was in the dark.  For years.

                        If Chloe was threatening to leave,
                        he would have gone ballistic.

                        So maybe he is going to kill her.

                        This is what they mean by 'don't

                        Hold on a second -- the man called
                        me for help.

                        Scott Peterson called the cops,
                        too. 

                                        WALT
                        Point taken, but you know the
                        drill, John -- I can't arrest a
                        man for a murder he might commit. 
                        We haven't even found the victim.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (slightly hard)
                        My visions aren't some kind of
                          alternate reality, they are reality --
                        unless we change it.

                                        WALT
                                (tosses it back)
                        Find out where it's going to
                        happen, I'll bring an army down
                        on the sonofabitch. 

          Walt reads Johnny's agitation.

                                        WALT
                        Go easy, John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll go easy when Chloe's safe.

          Johnny charges out.  Off Bruce and Walt's traded concern...



          Chloe.  We're back on THE PAINTING.  REVERSE on Johnny,
          still in his robe.  Staring at Chloe.  Johnny hasn't slept
          much.  Been a long night.  But he remains transfixed.  He
          touches the painting --


  29A29AAND WE'RE IN A VISION - CONTINUOUS

                                        CHLOE (O.S.)
                        It's my turn now.

          Johnny spins around.  Chloe is in the room with him, in
          her WHITE DRESS.  Johnny notices leaves blowing by his
          feet.  Right here in his house.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Chloe?

                                        CHLOE
                        I'm not sure I want you to see
                        this.

          Chloe walks, Johnny follows.  And the room bleeds away in
          a MATCH, MOVE, MORPH to become...          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TWO - 2/1/05 - PINK  28.



          An antique-filled, Yankee-style Maine house.  Chloe leads
          Johnny/Lyne to a window, and her easel... with her
            modernist artwork on it.  He stops cold, smiles.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        Why didn't you show me this before? 

                                        CHLOE
                        I was afraid.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        Don't be silly.  We have no
                          secrets.

            A moment.  She's eager to hear what her father thinks.

                                        CHLOE
                        Well.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        It's... fascinating.

                                        CHLOE
                        You say that like it's a bad thing.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                          Painting isn't just about the
                          picture, Chloe.  You must control
                        the canvas.  Your angles and colors
                        are appealing.  But it's only the
                          surface.

                        The surface.

                        You can't trust the surface. 
                        It's always beautiful.  And it's
                        almost always a lie.

          As Chloe takes this in, we BLEED BACK INTO...



          as he looks at the painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't trust the surface...

          A KNOCK at the door.



            A haggard Johnny opens the front door.  It's Bruce, two
          coffees in hand.

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn, boy.  Tell me you called
                        Loren and she kept you up all
                        night.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not Loren.

          Johnny busies himself, finding paper and pencil.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw Chloe again.  I was with
                        her -- I mean, Lyne was.  They
                        were at this creepy old place.

          With that, Bruce stops cold.  The room is littered with
          more insane "jots" of Chloe, drawn on any available piece
          of paper, from bills to faxes to Sunday circulars.  Her
          image is eerily repeated.  As Bruce finds stuff, TIGHT
          SHOTS reveal many of the Chloe images also have the BLOOD
          drawn on them, along with frozen eyes of death.

                                        BRUCE
                        This the part when you start saying
                          "Redrum"?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I get these images in my head,
                        Bruce.  Drawing them helps.

                                        BRUCE
                          I thought you couldn't draw.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I can't.

          It would be funny if it weren't creepy.  Johnny quickly
          begins one of his jots.

                                        BRUCE
                        These visions are having some
                        kind of residual effect.  You
                        said you became Lyne, right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So I picked up his talent?

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe more.  If you feel compelled
                        to draw these things, maybe you're -- 
                        I don't know -- picking up his
                        obsession.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you, Dr. Phil now?

                                        BRUCE
                                (back at him)
                        I don't know, Oprah --
                                (annoyed by jotting)
                        What are you doin', fool?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shows him drawing)
                        This is it.  She said it was their
                          'special place.'

          Johnny shows Bruce his paper -- an image of the distinctive
          YANKEE HOUSE.  And a good one.  Bruce eyes it, then a
          light bulb goes off.  As he digs through Johnny's crazy
            drawings, he finds his coffee table books on Lyne.

                                        BRUCE
                        I've seen it before....
                                  (searching)
                        Here.  The Gamble House.  'Part

                        She was there with Lyne.  She was
                        wearing the same dress she had on
                        in the painting.  The one she's
                        wearing when she's killed.

          OFF Johnny's drawing, we....

  3333OMITTED
  THRUTHRU

          A sumptuous little soiree in progress.  Beautiful People
          in tailored suits and barely-there cocktail dresses. 
          Artistic and critic types are in the mix, with partygoers
          and hangers-on clustered around them.

          But here's the thing:  Johnny moves through the party at
          normal speed.  Everyone else is slightly OVERCRANKED.  
          Johnny glimpses --


          DOWN A CORRIDOR

          Through a doorway.  A MAN and WOMAN.  Making out.  The
          Man slips down the strap of the woman's dress, kissing
          her bare shoulder.  And then, a SECOND WOMAN joins them.


          BACK ON JOHNNY

          He moves on, then spots Chloe among the partygoers.

          In that dress.  Stunning.  Johnny walks up to her.  Still
            OVERCRANKED, she looks through him.  Past him.

          Johnny follows her gaze to...

          Tom Graydon.  The art dealer.  He smiles at Chloe, motions
          her toward a corridor.

          As Johnny follows them, the PARTY GOES TO NORMAL SPEED
          and Johnny stays behind them.  

                                        GRAYDON
                        I'm so happy you came.  Anyone
                        ever tell you you're stunning?

                                        GRAYDON
                        I still can't get over it -- you
                        really are like something out of
                        an Andrew Lyne painting.  The
                          resemblance is uncanny.

                        Mr. Graydon, about tonight.  I'm

                                        GRAYDON
                        Just relax.  Play it like we
                        discussed.

          Chloe nods, but she's clearly uneasy.  Graydon arrives at
          a door to one of those corridor rooms.  He opens it to
          reveal....

          Andrew Lyne.  In a tuxedo.  Dashing and compelling. 

                                        CHLOE
                                  (recognizes him)
                        Is that...?

                                        GRAYDON
                        That's him. 

          Lyne approaches.  He gently touches her face, his hand
          tracing down along her neck in way that feels
            inappropriate.

                                        LYNE
                        My God, it's like a rebirth. 
                        It's Chloe, right?  

          Chloe can only nod.  Lyne and Graydon share a silent
          moment, then...

                                        LYNE
                        Would you like to sit for me,
                        Chloe?

                        Me.  Sit for you.

                        We could create something memorable
                          together. 

          Chloe is like a little girl lost.

                                        GRAYDON
                        She's an artist, too, sir.

                                        LYNE
                        We'll have to share our work then. 
                        From one fraud to another.

          He smiles at his own joke. 

                                        CHLOE
                        That would be amazing.

          Lyne reaches to touch her face again as tears well in his
          eyes.

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:



          On the CHLOE painting.  Johnny and Bruce once again face

                        Julia had gone out alone on the
                        water.  She fell in the boat and
                        hit her head.  Her body washed up
                        on the beach near the house.

          Bruce looks at the canvas.  Chloe in a room.  Night.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - THREE - 2/1/05 - PINK  37.

          Lyne.  Chloe is posed.  And as before, the transformation
          begins....

          Night becomes Day.  Moonlight in the window becomes
            SUNLIGHT.  The light is BLINDING.

          Johnny hears SEAGULLS.  Then there's WATER at Johnny's
          feet.  Lapping in.  Like the tide.   

          He looks at Chloe.  She stares at him.  Those eyes that
          go still with death....


          TIGHT ON THE EYES

          They change color.  From Chloe's brown, to blue.  And
          they're different eyes.


          BACK ON JOHNNY

          first time he notices that.  He waits for the blood to
          erupt from her forehead, as before, but without warning....


          EVERYTHING GOES WHITE

          Johnny finds himself in a BLANK, Matrix-like VOID!  What
          the hell? 

          And then... The sky begins to BLEED in behind Johnny.  An
          entire coastline appears.  We recognize it as the coast
          behind Lyne's house.

          Johnny is at the shore.

          And at his feet, on the sand, against some rocks....

          Julia's corpse.  Blood down her face.  And on her dress.

          She lies against the rocks.  A skiff beyond her in the
          sand.

          Johnny stands in this entirely NEW PAINTING.  Tide hits
          his feet.  When he looks down, there is one object NOT IN
          BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT:

          A BLOODY ROCK.  The murder weapon.  The water washes away
          the crimson.  When Johnny tries to touch it....

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - THREE - 2/1/05 - PINK  38.



          As Johnny comes out of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There was another painting.  It
                        was Julia. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You saw a different painting?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Everything went white.  Blank. 
                        Like it had been... Painted over.
                                (hits him)
                        He re-primed it.

          Johnny gets an idea.  Bruce isn't sure what it is, but...



          Walt at his desk with a file, Johnny and Bruce across.

                                        WALT
                        Lyne is listed as the father on
                        the death certificate.  He and
                        the mother were never married.

          Johnny opens the file to reveal a black-and-white CRIME
          SCENE PHOTO of Julia on the beach.  He holds it up to the
          JULIA PAINTING, which he and Bruce brought with them.... 
          Photo and painting are an exact match. 

                                        WALT
                        And he did find the body.  But he
                        was cleared of any involvement. 
                        As far as the world is concerned,
                        Julia's death was an accident. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's because they never found
                        the murder weapon.

                        The rock.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He killed her, Walt.  I saw it.

                                        BRUCE
                        You said you saw Chloe die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The rock was in both visions --
                        which is why he painted over her. 
                                (it's hitting him now)
                        To obscure the truth.  The surface
                        is a lie.  Don't you see the
                          pattern? 
                                (off their looks)
                          Daughter becomes muse.  Muse
                        becomes obsession.  Obsession
                        becomes murder.

          The reality sinks in. 



          Lyne's assistant, Nora, moves some canvases around near
          the wall.  Prominent among them, an UNFINISHED PAINTING. 
          The shape and sketch of Chloe is unmistakable.

          Lyne walks in front of it, facing off with Johnny, Walt
          and Bruce.

                                        LYNE
                        This is why I need Chloe to come
                        home.  To finish the new
                          collection.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about Julia?  Did you need
                        her, too? 

                                        BRUCE
                        I think she served her purpose. 
                        He didn't need the muse anymore.

                                        LYNE
                        What are you trying to imply?

                        That you killed your daughter,
                        Mr. Lyne.

                                        LYNE
                        Julia was my life.  And Chloe
                        will always be, even though she's
                        not my flesh and blood.  Ask Nora.

                                        NORA
                        Mr. Lyne, I --

                        Tell them.

                                        NORA
                                (beat, uneasy)
                        I remember Julia.  I also remember
                        the day Mr. Lyne found her on the
                        beach.  It was terrible.  He
                          couldn't have hurt her.  Or Chloe.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (accusatory)
                        Chloe's still useful.

                                        LYNE
                        I love her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You used her.

                                        LYNE
                        I was her teacher.  We had a
                          mutually beneficial relationship --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then why did she run away?

                                        LYNE
                                (snaps)
                        I don't know.

            A moment.  Lyne gathers himself.  Nora tries to act like
          the help -- invisible. 

                                        LYNE
                        Compassion isn't a crime,
                        gentlemen.

                          Compassion, or obsession?

          Lyne exits.

                        He controls the canvas.

          Off Johnny....



          Where Bruce and Johnny met Graydon in Act I.  It's after
          hours.  The place is empty.  Graydon hurries to the front
          door and taps the number code lock as the door buzzes and
          open.  He enters.  

          We're behind him, FOLLOWING HIM.  He rushes to his desk
          and opens a drawer.

          INSIDE: A locked compartment.  He opens it with a key he
          has hidden under a vase.

          He extracts paperwork jammed into a file.  Got what he
          wanted.  But as he rushes out....

          He crosses with Johnny.  But Graydon doesn't acknowledge
          him.

          This has all been a VISION.

                                                                              WHOOSH TO:


            GRAYDON'S DESK

          as Johnny uses a key hidden under a vase on the desk (he
          watched Graydon use in during the vision).

          Johnny extracts the folder and papers we saw Graydon
            retrieve.  He flips through.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Penobscot County papers.  Birth
                          certificates.  Name change
                        documents.  For Lyne's daughter.

          Johnny seems frozen by something.

                                        BRUCE
                        So come on -- what's Chloe's real
                        name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not Chloe.  Julia.

                                        BRUCE
                        Julia?  The dead one?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not going to believe this. 
                        She wasn't his daughter either.

          As the moment hits them, the front door opens.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:


          START on the painting of Julia, dead on the beach.  REVEAL
          Johnny, Walt and Bruce are in here.  They toss a look --


          THROUGH A WINDOW

          where Graydon is cuffed.  In a holding room.  Walt has
          the documents Johnny and Bruce found.

                                        WALT
                        I'm not going to ask how you came
                        to have these documents in your
                          possession.

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay.

                                        WALT
                        You better be right, John, or
                        this'll all come back to haunt
                        you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's already haunting me, that's
                        why I have to end it.

                                        WALT
                        Make sure.

          Johnny approaches the Julia painting.  Touches it.  WHOOSH!



          as he lets go of the painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's sharper than ever.  We have
                        to find her.

                                        WALT
                        That's one way to guarantee there
                        won't be a murder.

                                        BRUCE
                        If we've got Graydon in custody,
                        then we know he can't be the
                        killer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But he is the man with all the
                          secrets.  Let's find out if he
                        knows any more.



          Graydon in a chair -- across from the Julia painting. 
          Walt and Johnny are right beside it.  Roscoe's at the
          door.

                        Julia and I never met.

                                        WALT
                        But you had this file.  Sealed 
                          information concerning her real
                          identity.  Pretty good insurance
                        against the old man letting you
                        go. 

                                        GRAYDON
                        Lyne isn't letting me go.  His
                        life's gonna have a second act -- 
                        thanks to me.

          Johnny looks up from a piece of paper -- where he's been
            compulsively drawing Chloe again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And the new daughter you created.

                                        GRAYDON

                        Why do you think he created Julia
                        the first time around?  The crazy
                        old buzzard can't work without
                        his muse.  So I gave him Chloe --
                        and trust me, that girl was a
                        willing participant. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Until you started hitting on her.

          Graydon doesn't respond.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That is the real reason Chloe
                        ran, isn't it?  You were all over
                        her.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Last I checked, making unwanted
                          advances wasn't a crime. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (hard)
                        Where is she? 

                                        GRAYDON
                        I have no idea. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think you do.  You let her run,
                        but you're not gonna let her out
                        of your sight.  She's one of your
                          secrets.  If she gets exposed
                        that's very bad for business.

          Graydon stays mum.

                        Last I checked, obstruction of
                        justice was a crime.

                        Call Judge Cafferty, tell him I
                        need another search warrant...

          Graydon, feeling cornered, comes to his decision.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Alright... her name is Laura.

          Johnny, Bruce and Walt at the door.  Walt knocks.  No
          answer.  Traded looks -- Walt checks the door, which is
            unlocked.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Bruce)
                        Did you hear somebody scream?  I
                        swear I just heard somebody scream.

                                        WALT
                        You boys are a menace.

          They ENTER.

          The walls are dotted with sketches and art work.  Johnny
          touches a coat rack.

          WHOOSH -- 


  5959CHLOE (LAURA TIERNEY) APPEARS - VISION

          Chloe's CELL PHONE.  It RINGS.  She steps out from the
          bathroom and looks at the screen.  She recognizes it.

                                        CHLOE
                        Hey.

          Chloe takes a moment.  Emotion overcomes her.

                                        CHLOE
                        No, no, it was good to see your
                          number... I never wanted this,
                        either.  Really?  That's great
                        news.  Of course I'll come back.

          Chloe fights tears.  She rushes out.  For the coat rack. 
          When she reaches it, WHOOSH BACK TO:


  6060JOHNNY AT THE TABLE

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come back... She's going back to
                        him, Walt.
                                  (realizing)
                        She's going back to Lyne.

                                        BRUCE
                        You cannot be serious.

          Johnny hurries out, but when he touches the doorknob--

                                                                              WHOOSH TO:          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - FOUR - 2/1/05 - PINK  51.



          Johnny watches as Chloe enters.  As she moves further
          inside, she spots someone.

                                        CHLOE
                        I'm so glad you called.  I came
                        as quick as I could.  

          REVEAL it's Nora, not Lyne, across from Chloe. 

                                        NORA
                        He needs you.

                                        CHLOE
                        How is he feeling?  

                                        NORA
                        Like he wants to make things right.  

                                        CHLOE
                        Maybe we could work a little. 
                        Get his mind off things.

                                        NORA
                        Why don't you put on his favorite
                        dress?

          Nora finds the white dress on the rack.  As Chloe considers
          it, Nora takes off her apron.  Beneath, her usual clothing:
          We see a paint-stained T-shirt and jeans.  Exactly the
          way Johnny saw himself dressed in the vision of Chloe's
          murder.



          Johnny comes out of his VISION.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was Nora. 

                                        BRUCE
                        She called?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought it was Lyne, but it was
                          Nora....



          ... On Chloe, in one of those insane "jots" Johnny made
          earlier.  REVEAL Johnny, in jogging suit, sweaty, picking
          up the scraps and shoving them in a plastic bag.  Bruce,
          sipping OJ, grabs a bloody one and shows it to Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        So, in the end, my psychic friend,
                        who's obsession do you think you
                        were channeling -- Lyne's, or
                        Nora's?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't matter, it's gone.  Grabbed
                          a pencil this morning, here's
                        what came out...

          Johnny pulls a paper from his pocket.  Stick figures,
          badly drawn images of two men.  Bruce furrows his brow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's you and me.

                                        BRUCE
                        You caught my classic, masculine
                        jaw line.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's not your jaw -- that's a
                        hat.

                                        BRUCE
                          Interesting.

          Johnny opens.  It's Chloe.  Johnny smiles.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You look familiar.



          Chloe nurses tea, Johnny sips coffee.

                                        CHLOE
                        He called me today.  Said I could
                        move on if I wanted to.  That
                        he'd help me out with money.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that what you want?

                                        CHLOE
                        There's this art school for kids
                        near my apartment.  I'm gonna
                        teach.  Save up.  Maybe go to
                        France and study the masters.

          She smiles nervously, then...

                                        CHLOE
                        I still can't believe I did what
                        I did.  But it was something...
                        to to see 'the great Andrew Lyne'
                          painting again.  He seemed so...
                          amazing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        On the surface.

          She can't deny that.  She takes a final sip.

                                        CHLOE
                          I should get going.

          She hands him the tea mug, Johnny takes it.  A slight
          WHOOSH.  Chloe starts away...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Laura?

          She turns...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Try Italy.  I think you'll do
                        very well there.

                                        CHLOE
                        Italy?  Ciao!

          She smiles.  And Johnny watches her go.
