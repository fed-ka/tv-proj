      FADE IN:

      EXT. CALISTOGA CANYON RESORT - NIGHT (N/1)11

      Nestled amongst the rolling hills of Steinbeck Country, 
      California, lies the serene and picturesque Calistoga Canyon 
      Resort & Spa.  Spanish Mediterranean architecture.  Luxurious 
      suites with private patios opening onto landscaped 
      courtyards.  An oasis of relaxation, far from the hectic life 
      its upscale patrons lead.

      Looking in on one of the private villas, we see the low 
      flicker of light from candles glowing behind sheer curtains.  
      MAKE-OUT MUSIC PLAYS very softly.  The mood is quiet, 
      romantic -- that is until THREE SHOTS ring out in the night.  
      Muzzle flashes lighting up the room.

      EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE. CALISTOGA CANYON RESORT - DAY (D/2)22

      JANE, LISBON, RIGSBY and VAN PELT walk the grounds of the 
      resort, heading to the crime scene...

                                  LISBON
                          (off notebook)
                    We ve got Claire Wolcott, female 
                      Caucasian, 32 years old.  Found 
                    shot to death in her room.  Her 
                    husband has friends in the 
                      Governor s office.  He called in 
                    some favors, wants the 
                      investigation to be kept discreet 
                    and low key. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    His wife is murdered and his 
                    priority is discretion?  

      Lisbon leads the way into...

      INT. VICTIM S VILLA. CALISTOGA CANYON RESORT - CONTINUOUS33

      Inside the villa, candles are set up near the bed.  An empty 
      bottle of good champagne rests in an ice bath; two half-
      filled glasses nearby.  An expensive dress, high heels and 
      silk lingerie have been tossed on the floor in the heat of 
      passion.  The body of CLAIRE WOLCOTT lies naked under a blood-
      soaked silk sheet on the bed, as if asleep.  The adjacent 
      pillow is dented, by someone else s head, presumably.  A door 
      to a patio is half open.

      A UNIFORM COP stands by. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST      "Crimson Casanova"     GOLD 12/09/08     2.

      CONTINUED:33

                                  RIGSBY
                          (off the room)
                    Oh.  Okay. 

                                  LISBON 
                    Yup.  Mrs. Wolcott was cheating on 
                    Mr. Wolcott.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Which makes Mr. Wolcott suspect 
                    number one.  

                                  LISBON
                    Number two.  Number one would be 
                    Mrs. Wolcott s mystery lover.
                    The room s registered under Claire 
                    Wolcott, so no help there.  At two 
                      twenty-four AM, the night staff and 
                    a few guests heard three gunshots.  
                    Nobody could tell from where 
                    exactly.  Fifteen, twenty minutes 
                    later, hotel staff checked the room 
                    and called 911. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Boom.  Found a shell.

      With a pen, Rigsby picks up a shell casing across the room 
      from the bed and inspects it. 

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    Nine millimeter.

                                  LISBON
                    Leave it for forensics.

      Van Pelt points to another shell on the floor. 

                                  VAN PELT 
                    And another.

                                  JANE
                    So the lover didn t do it.  

                                  LISBON
                      Because...?

      Jane acts it out.

                                  JANE
                    Casings indicate the shooter was 
                    across the room here.  He or she 
                    stepped in from outside and started 
                    blasting away.

                    If the lover had done it, he d have 
                    been closer to the victim.  
                    Wouldn t have needed to shoot so 
                    many times.  And look...

      He points out a spot of blood on the floor.  Some distance 
      from the bed.  The others look at it.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Circular.  Meaning a vertical drip, 
                    from someone standing right here 
                    bleeding, right?  Not spatter from 
                    the victim. 

                                  LISBON
                          (grudging)
                    You re a forensics expert now.

                                  JANE 
                    So Claire and mystery lover are 
                    asleep.  Someone comes in through 
                    the open door.  Shoots them and 
                    leaves.  Poor lover is woken by a 
                    bullet, Claire dead beside him.  
                    Aaaah!

      Jane acts out waking and finding a dead body next to him.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    But then nobody comes right away. 
                    Mystery lover, who is only slightly 
                    wounded, gets to thinking maybe it 
                    would be best to just slip away.   

      Jane exits via the glass door to the patio.

      EXT. VICTIM S PATIO. CALISTOGA CANYON RESORT - CONTINUOUS44

      Jane crosses the courtyard searching the ground.  Lisbon 
      heads out from the room after him.

      Jane finds a tiny spot on the pathway.

                                  JANE 
                    There we go.

      Sure enough, there s a spot of blood, then another; like a 
      trail of bread crumbs leading down the path.  The trail leads 
      to A PARKING LOT, and disappears.  They comb the lot for more 
      spots.  

                                  LISBON
                    Anything?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST      "Crimson Casanova"     GOLD 12/09/08     4.

                                  JANE 
                    No.  You?

                                  LISBON
                    No.

      Jane eyes the car nearest the last blood spot.  A high-end 
      white CADILLAC.  Its license reads "DOCLADY."

      INT. RECEPTION AREA. CALISTOGA CANYON RESORT - DAY55

      Jane and Lisbon with a CONCIERGE behind a counter, a COMPUTER 
      SCREEN before him.

      The Concierge checks the computer...

                    The silver Caddy arrived last 
                    night, two-thirty-one.

                                  JANE
                    Seven minutes after the shooting 
                    took place.

      INT. ROOM 112. CALISTOGA CANYON RESORT - DAY66

      Jane and Lisbon stand outside room 112 with a RESORT 
      EMPLOYEE.  Lisbon KNOCKS on the door.  No answer. 

                                  LISBON
                    Open it.

      The employee opens the door.  Lisbon and Jane enter.  Inside, 
      a medical bag opened on the counter.  First aid paraphernalia 
      strewn about.  A gorgeous FEMALE DOCTOR, 30's, lies asleep in 
      bed, spooning with PAUL FRICKE, 35, a nebbishy looking guy 
      with a fresh bandage on his arm.  Lisbon knocks on the wall.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Hey.  Wake up.

      Fricke and the Doctor wake with a start.  Fricke fumbles for 
      glasses on the bedside table.

                                  DOCTOR
                    Oh my God.  Who are you?

      Lisbon shows her badge.

                    Take a wild guess.

      Fricke sighs and gets out of bed, more whiney than contrite. 

                                  FRICKE
                    I m not under arrest am I?  I ve

      Staff and guests watch coroner s men take Claire Wolcott 
      away.  Among them is KATIE, (20 s) a waitress. 

      EXT/INT. VICTIM S VILLA - DAY88

      Rigsby s outside the door talking with a hotel manager - 
      KEVIN HAIGHTLY, (40 s) well-groomed, plain.

                                  HAIGHTLY
                    I know we can t expect to get the 
                    room back, but when might the 
                    walkway be open for use, d you 
                    think?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Depends when forensics gets done. 

      Haightly s trying to look inside at the crime scene...

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    We ll let you know.

      He shuts the door on Haightly.  

      Paul Fricke is being questioned by Lisbon, Jane and Van Pelt.  
      He seems quite calm given the situation.

                                  FRICKE 
                    It was a cold night.  So we lit a 
                    fire and made love on the rug 
                    there.  We went to sleep 
                      afterwards.  Then suddenly there s 
                    like a sharp pain, and bang I wake 
                    up and there s blood everywhere and 
                    I m shot in the arm and Claire s 
                    dead.  You know?  I freaked.

                    You didn t see who did it?

                    Claire was dead.  I couldn t help

                          (confiding)
                    She s a married woman.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes, we know.  And Dr. Jill 
                      Rubenstein.  What s your connection 
                    with her?

                                  FRICKE
                    The Doctor lady?  I met her in the 
                    parking lot and asked her for help.

                                  LISBON
                    A total stranger took you back to 
                    her room, treated your wound, and 
                    then had sexual intercourse with 
                    you.

      Fricke shrugs modestly.  Yup.

                                  FRICKE
                    What can I say?  The Hippocratic 
                    oath is a beautiful thing. 

      Lisbon and Van Pelt are puzzled.

                                  JANE
                    How well did you know Claire 
                    Wolcott?

                                  FRICKE
                    I didn t, really.  I met her a few 
                    weeks ago.  She was at a bar and I 
                    picked her up.  Since then I ve 
                    seen her occasionally for sex.

                                  LISBON
                    Is that what happened tonight?

                                  FRICKE
                    Yes.  I called and asked her to 
                    meet me for a drink.  We came here.

                                  LISBON
                    Who else knew you were here?

                                  FRICKE
                    Nobody.  Me and Claire.

                    A few hours.  I d agreed to, you 
                    know, stay the night. 
                          (grimacing at the concept)
                    I was fond of Claire, and it s a 
                    long drive home, so I stayed.  I 
                    don t normally do that.

                                  LISBON

                                  FRICKE
                    After lovemaking?  Depends on the 
                    type of woman.  Some women, I leave 
                    soon as I m done.  Others, half an 
                    hour to an hour, maximum, of 
                    spooning and pillow talk, then 
                    leave.  Some you want to mix it up, 
                    keep `em guessing.   

                                  LISBON
                    You have it down to a science.

                    I m good at what I do.

                                  LISBON
                    And what is that?  What you do.

                                  FRICKE
                    I m a pick-up artist.  A woman 
                      whisperer, if you will.

                    A pick-up artist?  That s your 
                      profession?

      From Fricke, a microflash of anger, then a smile.

                                  FRICKE
                    You sound like my mom.
                    It s more of a total lifestyle.          
                      I practice my art of course, that s 
                    my passion.  But I teach and I blog

                    No.  Like I say, I was fond of 
                    Claire.  I planned to keep seeing 
                    her.  You really only want to

                    Paul, is your mother still alive?

      Fricke is a degree chillier when talking to a man.

                                  FRICKE
                    I know where you re going with 
                    this, Dr. Freud.  And you re wrong. 
                    My mom s dead, as it goes, but I 
                    loved her dearly.  And she loved me.

                    Who said anything about your 
                    mother?

                                  FRICKE
                    You just did.

                    Yes you did.

      Jane laughs and gives Fricke a semi-gentle slap on the arm. 

                                  JANE
                    I m playing with you, Paul.

      Fricke s irritated and off balance, as Jane planned.  

                                  FRICKE
                    Are we done here?

                                  JANE
                      Interesting.  He s either a 
                    habitual liar telling the truth, or 
                    an honest man lying.

      Fricke thinks twice about committing himself to a reply.

                                  LISBON
                    D you keep records?  Of your pick

                                  JANE
                    Could be.

      Fricke s actually kind of pleased and flattered by the

                                  CHO
                    Did you?  Stay the night in town?

                                    WOLCOTT
                    I did.

                                  CHO
                    Did she say where she was going, or 
                    who she was meeting?

                                    WOLCOTT
                    No.  But I didn t ask.

                                  CHO
                    So you didn t know she was at the 
                    spa. 

                                    WOLCOTT
                      I wouldn t expect to know.  She 
                    often went up there on a whim.    

                                  CHO
                    Can you think of anyone who held a 
                    grudge against her?  

                                    WOLCOTT
                    No.  She was, she was harmless. 

                                  CHO
                    Any friends or family that might be 
                    mixed up with bad people?  

                                    WOLCOTT
                    She s from back east.  She doesn t 
                    have friends or family out here.
                    She shopped and played tennis and 
                    went to spas.  No-one had motive 
                    to...

                                  CHO 
                    Yes?

                    I recall she did fire an assistant 
                    last month.  Caught her stealing 
                    jewelry.  She was pressing charges.

      Cho writes, then gives Wolcott a beat...

                                  CHO
                    Are you aware that on the night of 
                    her murder your wife was meeting a 
                    lover?

      Wolcott stares at Cho for a beat. 

                                    WOLCOTT
                    Yes.  The local authorities told me 
                    they suspected as much.  

                                  CHO
                    Did you know she had a lover?  
                    Prior to her death, I mean?

                                    WOLCOTT
                    No.  Do you have a name?  Is he a 
                    suspect? 

                                  CHO 
                    We have a name.  He s not a

                                    WOLCOTT
                    Who is he?

                                  CHO

                                    WOLCOTT
                    I want his name.

                                  CHO
                    You can t have it.

                                    WOLCOTT
                    Are you sure, Agent Cho?  I can 
                    make one phone call, and your

                    get with one call is pizza. 
                    This business dinner you were at in 
                    San Francisco, what s the timing on 
                    that?  And who else was there? 

      Wolcott rises, bristling, but keeping himself under control.

                                    WOLCOTT
                    My people can give you times and

      EXT. MODEST APARTMENT - DAY1212

      Jane and Van Pelt arrive outside a stucco apartment complex.  
      NATALIE EDREAU, 22, a spoiled sorority girl, answers.

                                  VAN PELT

                    We re with the CBI.  Can we come 
                    in?

      Natalie looks reluctant, barring the door.

                                    NATALIE
                    I already told the cops I didn t 
                    steal anything from that bitch.

                                  VAN PELT

                                  JANE
                    She was murdered last night.

      Natalie reacts.  Shocked more than upset.  Jane breezes past 
      her into the apartment.

                    anything.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Claire pressed charges against you.

      Jane moves around the room as she speaks, watching her all 
      the time.  As the conversation proceeds, we note as he does 
      that she gets blinky and nervous when Jane hovers by her 
      overflowing desk.

      He moves his free hand across the crowded tabletop, whilst 
      looking closely at her, studying her micro-expressions, 
      change in pulse, and subtle eye movements.  After a couple of 
      passes and stopping and starting, he hovers over a mid-range

      Bingo.  Natalie looks guilty even to our untrained eyes.

      together out at a bar.  Smiling sorority smiles, cheeks red

      Jane and Van Pelt look to Natalie, who can only put her head 
      in her hands and sigh.

                    Think this through, Natalie.  We re 
                      investigating murder.  If you have 
                    an explanation for these that 
                    doesn t involve killing her?  You 
                    should tell us.  Get yourself off

      Natalie sees his point.

                                    NATALIE
                    I thought if I threatened to tell 
                    her husband about her affair, she d 
                    drop the theft charges.  That s

                    How did you know Claire was having 
                    an affair?

                                    NATALIE
                    It was obvious.  She kept sending 
                    me out to buy men s gifts.  You 
                    know, like watches.  Ties.  I knew 
                    they weren t for Keith.  I m not an 
                    idiot.

                                  CHO
                    What did Claire say when you 
                      confronted her about it?

                                    NATALIE
                    I didn t confront her.  Claire left 
                    with that flugly guy before I got 
                    the chance.

                    It probably wouldn t have worked

                    Because Keith Wolcott is, like, 
                    super controlling.  Especially with 
                    money.  He probably knew all along

      Jane goes to the glass patio door, opens it, steps outside to 
      the patio.  Shuts the door, then finds that it can t be 
      opened from outside.  He gestures to Rigsby, who opens the

      Inside, Rigsby points out Paul Fricke sitting alone at a 
      table.

      A young waitress -- KATIE -- leans over Fricke, taking his 
      order.  Upon seeing the two together, Haightly becomes a 
      little tense.  His jaw clenches shut.  Jane clocks this.

                    Just asking.

      Jane hands her the check and Katie hurries away.  

                                  FRICKE
                    I used to let her sleep with me 
                    once in a while.  That s all.  

                                  JANE
                    No.  You have real feelings for 
                    her.

      Fricke looks awkward.  

                                  FRICKE
                    Years ago, maybe a little.  Sure. 
                    Before I got my mojo working. 

      Jane rises, and Rigsby does likewise.  They shake hands with 
      Fricke.

                                  JANE 
                    Good to talk to you Paul.

                                  RIGSBY
                    You had another question for him.

                                  JANE
                    Oh yes.  I forgot.  That night, 
                    when you went to sleep with Claire, 
                    was the patio door open or closed? 

                                  FRICKE
                          (takes a beat to recall)
                    Closed I think.

                                  JANE
                    Thanks. 

      Jane exits, Rigsby follows.  Fricke frowns, left off balance.

                    was killed, Claire Wolcott made a

                    Here s the best part.  According to 
                    the bank, Keith Wolcott set up the 
                    account so that he d be notified 
                    whenever a large transaction took

                    Meaning Wolcott had to have known

                    Exactly.

      Van Pelt heads off.  Cho sighs, then approaches the women

      EXT. HOT TUB AREA - CONTINUOUS2525

      Where we find Paul Fricke dangling his legs in a hot tub in 
      which TWO WOMEN are immersed. 

                                  FRICKE
                    I d come in with you, but I have to 
                    keep my injury dry. 

      The women don t respond.

                    Gunshot wound. 
                          (still nothing)
                    But don t worry, you re not in any 
                    danger.  I m a lover.  Not a 
                    fighter.

      Skeeved out, the two women get out of the hot tub and split.  
      Fricke turns to find Van Pelt and Rigsby looking at him 
      sourly.

                                  FRICKE (CONT D)

                    The old magic not working so good 
                    today?

                                  FRICKE
                    It s like baseball.  Most of the 
                    time, even in the Major Leagues, 
                    you swing and you miss.  You have 
                    to keep swinging.  I hit on ten 
                    women a day, I m going to have 
                    sexual intercourse with one of 
                    them.  At least.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    That is gross.

                    too proud to admit it.

                    No.  I stopped the check

                    her infidelity with Fricke cut the

                    If Claire had lived, come Monday, 
                    she was in for a nasty surprise. 
                    I was all set to serve her divorce

                    You misled us Paul.  You were going 
                    to take money from Claire.

                                  FRICKE 
                    But I didn t.  Did I?  A business 
                    associate of mine is opening a new 
                    club in town.  He offered me a role 
                    as partial owner if I could come up 
                    with a share of the building costs.  
                    Claire was generous enough to offer 
                    me a loan.   

                                  CHO

                                  JANE
                    Of course it is.  She loves you.  
                    That much is clear.  Maybe that s 
                    what all this was about?  Your 
                    behavior finally got to her?

      Fricke shifts in his seat.  Not enjoying this.

                                  FRICKE
                    Katie didn t have anything to do 
                    with this.

                                  JANE
                    How can you be so sure?

      Fricke grows concerned.  His slick exterior momentarily 
      disappears.

                                  FRICKE
                    I know Katie.  She s a good person.  
                    She wouldn t hurt anyone.

      Jane studies Fricke for a beat.

                                  JANE
                    Okay, great.  Thanks.  You can go.

                    I m sorry.  When Agent Cho says you 
                    can go, you can go.

      Jane exits.  Fricke looks to Cho.

                                  CHO
                    One moment.

      He follows Jane out...

      MUSIC PLAYS as Cho strides into the crowded lounge.  His hair 
      is spiked, he's wearing flashy clothes, some bling, and his 
      sunglasses are on inside.  

      Cho's peacocking -- a Venusian technique used to grab the 
      attention of women and instigate conversation.  Groups of 
      people, men and women alike, can t help but turn his way.

      Cho s at the bar.  Surveying the crowded lounge.  He checks

                    This isn t who he is.  When we were 
                    together, he was a sweet, caring 
                    generous man.  It was me that 
                    screwed it up.  We had a terrible 
                    fight.  I said some mean things.  
                    Mean things.  This is all an 
                    attempt to prove me wrong I guess.

                    Eh.  If I had a woman like you in 
                    love with me, you could say 
                    whatever you like.  I wouldn t be 
                    out running around.

                    That s nice of you to say so.

                    You mind?

      Fricke sits.  He has a heaviness about him, a seriousness.

                                  JANE
                    Rough night?

                                  FRICKE
                    Eh, not bad.  A couple of good 
                    phone numbers. 

      Jane and Fricke sit quiet for a beat.  Then Katie enters from 
      across the room.  Jane sees her, and a moment later Fricke 
      does as well.  In that moment, Fricke lights up.  But he 
        determinedly looks away.  

                                  FRICKE (CONT D)
                    Yup.  Two very tasty numbers...

      Jane calmly pours his drink on Fricke s head. 

                                  JANE 
                    Don t be so bloody stupid.  You 
                    have a good woman there.  That 
                    knows you and loves you.       

      Fricke stares at him for a beat, dripping.  Shocked.  Then he 
      slides out from the bar and heads over to Katie, who watches 
      nervously as he approaches.  Not sure what he wants with her.  
      After a few awkward beats, he reaches down and takes her 
      hand, leading her out.

      A beat on Jane, introspective.  He pays no attention to Katie 
      and Fricke. 

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.

      Jane turns to see a stunning woman before him.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST      "Crimson Casanova"     GOLD 12/09/08     55.

                                  WOMAN
                    You looked kind of lonely. 
                    My friend and I were wondering if 
                    you d like to join us?

      Across the room, the other woman waves from her table.     
      Jane shows her his wedding ring.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry.  Married.

      He turns back to the bar, takes a shot of his drink.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
