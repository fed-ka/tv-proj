the sky. He is smeared with dirt. He sports unkempt hair with 
three days worth of salt and pepper stubble on his chin. He 
 He is naked.appears to be in his 50 s.

His body jerks, stiffens and twitches haphazardly. He talks 
to himself, almost chanting, in an unfamiliar language. 

PERNELL
Ishtala ma fonla. Mansho silli 
fonla shakta tun shakta tun suya... 

We pull back to reveal he is in the middle of...


Guadalupe Park. A mile long green belt that runs through the 
center of San Vicente, California. The man is at the edge of 
a meadow. A small crowd of LOOKIE-LOOS has gathered around. 
They point and snicker. A young boy on a stroll with his mom, 
stops and stares. She covers his eyes and drags him away.

The man is oblivious...

PERNELL
I thraysh bonchela vocian. Hare tun 
vocian ma anjosi shakta...

Just beyond the crowd, HICKSON, a patrol cop, leans against 
his cruiser, watching. Amused. A second cruiser pulls up. 
SERGEANT SCOTT KESSLER, a seasoned veteran, steps out. 

As he approaches Hickson, Kessler takes in the scene. He sees 
a HIPSTER CHICK using her phone to get video. He looks past 
her to get a look at the naked man, and stops cold...

KESSLER
Oh shit. 

HICKSON

Kessler quickly heads for his trunk.

KESSLER

fucked Courtney Potts raw dog.

Hickson blushes a bit. Tries to cover it with swagger. 

HICKSON
Some things are worth the risk.

Kessler grabs a blanket from the trunk. Hickson spots a box 
of latex gloves, reaches for it. Kessler slaps his hand away.

KESSLER

HICKSON

Kessler wheels on him, pissed.

KESSLER
You dumb ass crackhead. Do you even 
look at the morning bulletins?

HICKSON
Hey, fuck you. If I m missing 
something, just say it.

Kessler grabs a briefing off the passenger seat of his 
 chest. Hickson checks the cruiser, shoves it into Hickson s
brief. MISSING PERSON: PERNELL NATHANIEL HARRIS. He looks at 
 the same man.the naked man in the clearing. We see it s

Pernell s jolted by the sound of his name. He opens his eyes.

 shoulders...gently wraps the blanket around Pernell s


A huge stretch of freshly excavated land. Construction 
workers and heavy machinery dot the landscape. 10.


Excavators, scrapers and bulldozers grade the land. A large 
sign on the edge of the site reads: FUTURE HOME OF BROOKS

 A town car pulls up in the shadow of the sign. ROBERT  BOBO

corrected, immediately.

Asa pauses his game, looks at the sign, nods.

ASA
You got his number?

Bobo gives his son a withering look, but doesn t have time to 
lay in to him, because a sporty Tesla is pulling up next to 
the town car.

 a high-level executive with no kids, no GUY FRANKEL (40 s),
spouse and no vices, gets out. His number two, ANNE (20 s), a 
feisty up and comer, gets out with him. Guy walks over to 
Bobo. Anne hangs back with Asa.

BOBO
I appreciate you coming out on 
short notice, Guy.

GUY

He hands Guy a tourist brochure.

Guy waves out over the expansive construction site.

BOBO
Then why the fuck did you reopen 
negotiations with Fremont?

GUY
Mr. Brooks believes in keeping his 
options open, just in case.

BOBO
Things have been done that can t be

hands to be having second thoughts. 
This train is moving, understand?

GUY
I do. But is everyone we need still

BOBO
Hell yes.

Of course he does. Any man would.

Shane Brennan walks to his patrol car, with a spring in his 
step. A cop who loves his job. He takes a photo from his 
breast pocket. He kisses it, and clips it to the sun visor. 
We see a picture of his beautiful wife, and two adorable 
kids. A cop who loves his family. His LIEUTENANT taps on the 
window...

LIEUTENANT
Yo, Brennan.

SHANE

KD walks towards the halfway house, bible in hand. Pernell s 
car is parked next to the curb. As KD passes, Pernell drops 
the window, calls out.

PERNELL
You got a minute?

KD looks in, wary, then smiles when he sees Pernell. He gets 
in. Pernell pulls off.


Shane plays with his kids on the front lawn. They take turns 
spraying each other with water. Peals of laughter fill the 
air, floating away and...

Drifting through the open window of a stolen truck, parked 
 seat, halfway down the block. KD sits in the driver s
baseball cap pulled low over his eyes.

CRYSTAL (O.S.)
Goodnight, my angel,
Now it's time to dream.
And dream how wonderful your life 
will be...


Shane pulls his car into the parking lot. He heads into the 
store. Seconds later, KD pulls in.


Shane walks out with a shopping bag. He sees his car blocked 
in by KD s truck. It s empty, but the passenger door is open. 
Shane peeks in, looking for a clue as to who the owner is. KD 
 back.emerges from between cars, presses a gun into Shane s

KD
That s a gun, Shane. Be smart or it 
ll be your  just be you. It won t
wife and babies, too.

He pushes Shane into the cab.64.


CHAPLAIN (O.S.)
Through this holy anointing may the 
Lord, in his love and mercy help 
you with the grace of the Holy 
Spirit...


A dark and deserted field. The only light comes from the 
 truck. KD stands in the glow of those headlamps of KD s
 headlamps, waist deep, in the middle of a large hole. He s
digging. And there s Shane, lying next to the hole, hog tied.

SHANE
t rape  rape her. I didn I didn t
anybody. I swear to God, I didn t!

KD
Stop lying, Shane. I know the 
truth. You raped that woman... God 
wants you struck down.

SHANE
No. God would never tell anybody to 
kill somebody. God is love.

KD gives him a cold look, as he climbs out of the hole.

KD
You need to brush up on your bible 
studies, boy. 
(recites)
Rejoice with him, O heavens; bow 
down to him, all gods, for he 
avenges the blood of his children 
and takes vengeance on his 
adversaries.

He takes out a long knife, holds it high...

SHANE
No... Please...

KD
He repays those who hate him and 
cleanses his people's land.

And brings it down hard with both hands...

SHANE
PLEASE GOD! NO!!!!


Shane lies, covered in stab wounds, struggling to breathe. KD 
stands over him.

KD
You can still go to Heaven, Shane. 
Do you want to?

Shane gurgles blood. Feels the sensation leaving his body.

SHANE
Yes.

KD kneels down next to him. Sympathy in his eyes.

KD
Do you accept Jesus as your lord 
and saviour?

SHANE
Okay.

KD
Say I do.

SHANE
I do.

KD
Say, Dear Lord, please forgive me.

SHANE
Dear Lord, please forgive me.
(spits blood)
They made me rape her.

KD is jolted. Not sure he heard right.

KD
What did you say?

SHANE
I just wanted to get the book. They 
said... I had to rape her... I had 
to do it that way.

KD
Who s they?68.


SHANE
Dear Lord, please... Forgive me.

A look of peace comes over Shane, as life begins to leave. KD 
violently shakes him and screams...

KD
 Who sthey? WHO MADE YOU?

Shane tries to answer, but instead, takes his last breath.
