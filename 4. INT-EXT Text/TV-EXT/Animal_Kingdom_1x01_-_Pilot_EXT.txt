      GEORGE and a group of VETS, NURSES and HANDLERS are all 
      HUDDLED around a TELEVISION watching a HORSE RACE.

                                  GEORGE
                    Come on, Lucky Seven, come on!

      LARS, a rotund, neer-do-well handler is frustrated. 

                                  LARS
                    He s in last place. You re supposed 
                    to be a great Vet, you just lost me 
                    a hundred bucks. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Race isn t over... Look at that 
                    sheen, look at that gallop, I m 
                    telling you, Lucky Seven is just 
                    warming up. 

      DR. KIM, a skittish vet, sweats bullets. 

                                  DR. KIM
                    Are you sure you know what you re 
                    doing, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    How do you think I paid my way 
                    through Veterinary School? 

                                    JAUNITA (O.S.)
                    Has anyone seen Dr. Coleman?!

      George looks over, though the window, he spots Juanita 
      searching for him in the hall. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Dr. Kim, get the blinds.

      Dr. Kim lowers the blinds to the window hiding them. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Dr. Zaius, get the door!

      DR. ZAIUS, who happens TO BE A CHIMPANZEE, wearing a LAB COAT 
      and a TINTED VISOR, throws his full weight against the door. 

                                  LARS
                    Holy cow! Lucky Seven is coming up 
                    the rear! Look at that horse move!                                                                                      5.


      The guys are getting more and more excited. Sure enough Lucky 
      Seven wins the race. Everyone CHEERS. Dr. Zaius cheers the 
      loudest, throwing his VISOR in the air. The door SLAMS OPEN. 

                                    JUANITA
                    Okay, everyone back to work. This 
                    is an Animal Hospital, not an OTB. 

      Everyone, shamefaced, exits under Juanita s glare. 

                                    JUANITA (CONT D)
                    And you, Dr. Coleman, are supposed 
                    to be in charge around here. 

      Juanita exits. George turns to Dr. Zaius. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Way to keep an eye on that door, 
                    Dr. Zaius. You just lost your ipad 
                      privileges. 


      The club is in full swing as George and Doug enter. Doug, 
      clearly excited, bobs his head to the music. George glares at 
      him and Doug stops. Doug takes out NOTE CARDS. 

                                  DOUG
                    Okay, so I Googled some pick up 
                    lines. Which ones do you like? Was 
                    that an earthquake or did you just 
                    rock my world?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    21.

                                  DOUG (CONT'D)
                    Oh, this one s really good: Are you 
                    Jamaican? Cuz Jamaican me crazy--

      George snatches the note cards away.

                                  GEORGE
                    Take a look at the bar and zero in 
                    on women who are playing with their 
                    hair. It signifies that they are 
                    sexually frustrated, or that they 
                    just did a ton of cocaine in the 
                    bathroom, either way, they ll be 
                      susceptible to being picked up. 

      Doug POINTS TO TWO HOT GIRLS PLAYING WITH THEIR HAIR. 

                                  DOUG
                    Those girls are totally on coke. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Good eye. Now follow my lead. 

      George and Doug walk up to the hot girls. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Ladies, what are you drinking?

                    beautiful women.

                    now. I may have to operate later 
                    tonight.

                    So, you guys are doctors?

                                  GEORGE

                                  HOT GIRL # 2

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, then let me show you a 
                    picture of my latest patient...

      George takes out his IPHONE and SHOWS THEM A PICTURE OF THE 
      CUTEST PUPPY EVER. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 1
                    Oh, my God! He s sooooo cute.

                    adorable! 

                                  DOUG
                    Here s who I m working on.

      Doug takes out his IPHONE and shows them a PICTURE. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 1 
                    Ewwwwww!

                                  HOT GIRL # 2
                    Gross! What is that?!

                                  DOUG
                    I was lancing a boil on an old cat. 
                    The green stuff is puss, the rest 
                    is just blood and mucus. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 1
                    That s disgusting. I m gonna be 
                    sick. 

                                  HOT GIRL # 2
                    Let me take you to the bathroom.

      The two Hot Girls walk away. 

                                  GEORGE
                    What is your problem?!

                                  DOUG
                    You told me to follow your lead! 

                                  GEORGE
                    Women like to see pictures of 
                    puppies and kittens and bunnies, 
                    because it taps into their maternal 
                    instinct and arouses in them a 
                    desire to procreate. Do you know 
                    how we procreate, Doug?                                                                                    23.


                                  DOUG
                    By having sex? 

                                  GEORGE
                    By having sex. Exactly. Puppies are 
                    Mother Nature s aphrodisiac. 

                                  DOUG
                    I m sorry. I should go. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You re just going to give up?

                                  DOUG
                    Who am I kidding, George? Nobody 
                    wants to be with me. It s just 
                    natural selection, I guess...

      George watches as Doug glumly retreats out of the club. 


      As Dorothy exits she spots a CAB pulling away, she chases it. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Taxi! Taxi!

      But, it s gone. She stands on the street searching for 
      another when George comes up behind her.                                                                                     35.


                                  GEORGE
                    You notice there s never a cab when 
                    you need one?

                                    DOROTHY
                    You did a good job today. You re a 
                    good vet, George. 

                                  GEORGE
                    I know. 

      She SNEEZES. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    Damn, I just can t shake this cold. 

                                  GEORGE
                    That s because you don t have a 
                    cold. You re allergic to animals. 
                    You re suffering from allergies. 

                                    DOROTHY
                    I ve never had allergies before.

                                  GEORGE
                    People develop different allergies 
                    as they get older. Sometimes 
                    they ll have an allergic reaction 
                    to the very things they once 
                    couldn t live without. 

      A TAXI stops in front of them. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Get some over the counter allergy 
                      medication, you ll be fine

                                    DOROTHY
                    Thanks, George. 

                                  GEORGE
                    You re welcome. Good night. 

      George gets into the cab. Dorothy watches him leave, until...

                                    DOROTHY
                    I can t believe he just stole my 
                    cab!

                                  END ACT THREE                                                                                    36.
