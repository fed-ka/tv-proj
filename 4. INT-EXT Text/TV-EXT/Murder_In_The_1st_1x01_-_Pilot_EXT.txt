      THE CITY is laid out before us. Chinatown. Fisherman s 
        Wharf. Russian Hill. The ocean lurks low, in the gaps.

        REVEAL POV of ERICH BLOUNT (28), a tech genius and the 
      CEO of APPLICON. He s on top of a SKYSCRAPER, at the 
        rooftop s edge, staring down -- 48 stories to pavement.

        Blount is boyish in his RAY BANS, his Italian SNEAKERS 
      and designer T-SHIRT, almost sweet looking. But there s 
      an anger lurking underneath, and a complex vulnerability. 

                                        MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                      What do you think?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Freaky.

                                        MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                      Good freaky?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Yeah. Freaky is good.

        Reveal IVAN WEXLER (40) standing behind him, holding a 
        HANDHELD. He s bearded, heavy set, dressed in all black -- 
        Blount s brilliant CTO and head of R&D. Ivan watches 
        Blount as he studies the city below like a painter.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      The bay should be darker. This is San 
                      Fran, not the Caribbean.

      Ivan eyes his handheld, then speaks to JOHN, off screen.

                                        IVAN
                      John, color correct the water. Try value 
                    at 3+. Chroma at L2. Hue at P1.

        A beat, then THE OCEAN AND BAY FADES TO DARKER BLUE. It s 
        a subtle shift, disorienting. An optical illusion.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Better. Let s see the birds.

        A FLOCK OF BIRDS appears, racing towards us. 

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      Lower their floor to five feet. More 
                      mustard. Right at us.

      Ivan presses on his HANDHELD and suddenly THE BIRDS DROP 
        LOWER, jumping across the sky like a computer glitch--                                                                                         2.


        --WE RE IN A 3-D VIRTUAL WORLD, A HOLOGRAM; a perfect 
        recreation of reality. If it weren t for their 
        adjustments, you would never know the difference.

        Blount stares out at his creation, content. 

                                        IVAN
                      You look like Abraham, staring down from 
                      the mountaintop.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Good. That s exactly what we re selling.-- 

        Blount steps forward, OFF THE ROOF, INTO THE SKY -- BUT 
      HE DOESN T FALL. He just stands there floating. 

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      --In my world, you get to play God.
                              (beat; turning back)
                      Good work, Ivan. See you on the plane.

      Ivan smiles, compliments are rare. Then he nods to 
        Blount,  presses  on  his  handheld,  and  SUDDENLY--     

      --THE SAN FRANCISCO HOLOGRAM MELTS AWAY, THE WORLD 
        LITERALLY DISSOLVING OFF THE SCREEN, LEAVING ONLY ERICH--



        --BLOUNT STANDING ALONE IN THE DESERT. 

      He pulls off his sensory devices: micro EAR BUDS; a 
        NEURAL IMPULSE PATCH on the nape of his neck; specialized 
      RAY BANS. His dark eyes flicker with genius and doubt. 

      He walks to a WHITE SUV that s parked on the shoulder. 
      The DRIVER opens the passenger door and shouts out. 

                                        SALTER
                      Let s go! You re late!

      This is JIMMY SALTER (56), a tough former cop with a 
        boxer s nose and Blount s head of security. 

        Blount gets in and slams the door. Salter fishtails onto 
      the road, past a sign that READS: LEAVING SANTA FE.

        A tough city block deep in the TENDERLOIN. UNIFORMS and 
      EMT TECH S move around the scene. Neighbors casually 
      watch from sidewalks and windows. Hildy and Terry are now 
        mid-interview with SUE DURHAM (40s, butch, mixed-race).                                                                                        9.

                      recyclers for a couple bucks a pound.

                    Do you know their names? Ages?

                                        TERRY
                      Any idea where we could track them down?

                                        SUE DURHAM
                      Try Boeddeker Park. That s the 
                        neighborhood hang.

                                        HILDY
                      Thanks.

      Sue nods, then heads back inside her home. Terry and 
      Hildy move back towards the scene. The BODY BAG is on a 
        stretcher, being loaded into an AMBULANCE. 

      An EMT TECH intercepts them, handing Terry an iPAD.

                                        EMT TECH 
                    We found it under the body.

      Terry nods thanks. EMT Tech walks away. Hildy watches as 
      Terry awkwardly flips the iPAD around in his hands.

                                        HILDY
                    Do you know how to use it?

                                        TERRY
                    Of course.

      He s lying. Hildy reaches over, presses the POWER BUTTON.

                                        HILDY
                      Don t hurt yourself.

      Terry shoots her a sideways smile: fuck off.

      ANGLE ON iPAD -- an  APPLICON  APPLICATION flickers to 
      life, the company s RED LOGO filling the screen. [MOS]                                                                                        10.

        Terry, holding the I-PAD, walks with Hildy towards 850 
        BRYANT STREET, a stone monolith that houses every element 
      of the city s justice system. POLICE CRUISERS, AMBULANCES 
      and CITY VEHICLES fly around the edges. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Hildy and Terry exit the elevator, walking towards a door 
        labeled  ROOM 455-HOMICIDE.  Hildy speaks low.                                                                                        14.

      Terry and Hildy walk down a busy sidewalk, through a mob 
      of DOWNTOWN PROFESSIONALS.

                      Shouldn t you be there?

                                        TERRY
                      You would think. But Emily shot that 
                      down, said I d just get in the way. She 
                      insists I keep working. 

      Terry shrugs, at a loss. Confused. A beat.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      I have no idea what I m doing, Hildy. 
                      There s no manual for this.

                                        HILDY
                      Just keep listening to Emily. She s a 
                      strong woman. She knows what she needs, 
                      and what you need. 

      They reach an intersection and stop for the light. They 
      stare across at 101 CALIFORNIA STREET, the modern 
        skyscraper that houses APPLICON. 

        HILDY s phone BUZZES. She looks at it--

      PHONE TEXT READS:  YOU HAVE FOUR NEW MATCHES  

        A Dating App. Hildy tries to hide it from Terry, but he 
      sees it and smiles, eager to rib.

                      It s sad to see you pimp yourself out on

                      Let me see.

        A beat. Hildy exhales, then hands him her phone.

                                        HILDY
                      You enter your preferences. It comes back

                                        HILDY
                      Nope.

                                        TERRY
                      Can I make a friendly suggestion?

                                        HILDY

                      Try lowering your standards.

      They walk past the terraced gardens, towards APPLICON S 
      main entrance. Hildy pushes through the doors, then turns 
      back to Terry and smiles.

                                        HILDY
                      Maybe Erich Blount is single?

      Off on Terry, not amused. Touch .

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Hildy and Terry walk into a Tenderloin park. Terry is on 
      the phone, dealing with his wife s move. 

                                        TERRY (INTO PHONE)
                      How many watts? I have no idea. Look, 
                      just set her up in the rear den. There 
                      should be two or three outlets on the 
                      wall. I ll be back within the hour.

      He hangs up. He s angry. The pressure is getting to him. 

                                        HILDY
                    Go home. I can handle this.

      He looks around. The park is full of addicts, drunks, and 
      local street kids playing basketball.

                                        TERRY
                      No. But let s make this quick.

      They approach the court where B-HOP (12) twists past his 
        defender, down the lane, as FRANKLIN (13) feeds him the 
      ball for a reverse lay up. Hildy grabs a RUCKSACK on the 
      edge of the court. Franklin and B-Hop see her, rush over.

                                        B-HOP
                      YO! PUT THAT DOWN!

                              (flashing his badge)
                      B-Hop? Franklin? We need to talk.

      Hildy joins them, holding the rucksack. She opens it and 
      dumps its contents -- FULL OF COPPER and SCRAP METAL. 

                                        HILDY

                      They ll eat you alive in there.

                                        B-HOP
                      For copper?

                                        TERRY
                      Try murder. 

                                        HILDY
                      We ve got you on video.

      The boys swallow hard, terrified. Franklin makes a break 
      for it, SPRINTING. But Terry lunges after him, grabbing 
      him by the neck and pulling him to the ground. 

      Hildy keeps her eye on B-HOP, but he s not going 
        anywhere, frozen, tongue-tied, in shock. His pants are 
        wetting from the inside. Franklin shoots him eyes.

                                        FRANKLIN
                      B-Hop! What are you doin , man?

                                        TERRY
                      Pissing his pants. 

                                        HILDY
                      You re scared because you know something 
                      about that murder.

                                        B-HOP
                    We didn t kill nobody.

                                        TERRY
                      Maybe. But you know who did.

        A beat as the boys hesitate, looking at each other.

                                        HILDY
                      Obstruction of justice on a first degree 
                      murder. Your prints at the scene. Not to 
                      mention the copper. Destruction of city 
                      property. Grand theft. 

                                        TERRY
                      Plenty to get you two tried as adults.

                                        FRANKLIN
                    We didn t see nothing. 

                                        B-HOP
                              (cracking)
                      Tell  em Franklin.

        Franklin is stone-faced. He s not talking. Terry looks at 
        Hildy. His eyes say, play along.                                                                                        25.


                                        TERRY
                      Suit yourself.

      Terry takes out his cuffs and grabs B-Hop by the ear, 
      hard. Hildy takes Franklin by the arm.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      You have the right to remain silent...

                                        FRANKLIN
                      Whoa! Whoa!

                                        HILDY
                      Anything you say, can and will...

                                        B-HOP
                      Okay! Maybe we saw someone in there.

                                        FRANKLIN
                              (to B-HOP)
                      Cabron! You gonna get us killed.

                                        HILDY
                      What d he look like?

                                        B-HOP
                      Like one of those white bikers. 

      Hildy and Terry share eyes and let up some. Bingo. 
        Franklin exhales, the cat s out of the bag.

                                        FRANKLIN
                      Hells Angel. But homeless. Smelled like 
                      piss.

                                        B-HOP
                      He s a dealer. Crazy. Always packing.

                                        FRANKLIN
                      He s gonna kill us when he hears we 
                      ratted him out.

                                        HILDY
                      What s his name?

                                        B-HOP
                      Blue Big Bird.

                                        HILDY
                      Blue what?

                                        FRANKLIN
                      That s what we call him. 

                                        B-HOP
                    He has Big Bird inked on his neck. But 
                      it s blue.

      Hildy and Terry hold eyes. They ve got a lead. They 
        release the two boys, who brush off.                                                                                        26.


                                        B-HOP (CONT D)
                      Yo, do I need a lawyer?

                                        TERRY
                    Go on. Beat it.

      They look at them, then grab their RUCKSACK and jog away. 
      Hildy smiles, pleased with their progress.

                                        HILDY
                      Blue Big Bird.

        Terry s phone buzzes. He looks at the screen: EMILY

                                        TERRY
                      I gotta get home.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        HEADLIGHTS pierce through the fog that shrouds a flat, 
        middle-class neighborhood. We track an UNMARKED CRUISER 
      as it passes, then pulls into a driveway and parks.



      Sun glints off the windows of 850 Bryant Street.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The UNMARKED CRUISER moves east, across the BAY BRIDGE.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        A poor neighborhood in East Oakland. Hildy and Terry get 
      out of their cruiser. They move to the porch of a 
        dilapidated single family home with bars on the windows 
      and doors. Tough young men watch from the street corners.                                                                                        31.


      Terry watches the street, while Hildy knocks several 
        times. The door finally opens, answered by a grouchy 
      JAMES HARBACH (80) in sweatpants with electrocuted hair. 
      He looks Terry and Hildy over. They flash their badges.

                                        TERRY
                      Mr. Harbach? Inspector Seagrave, my 
                      partner Inspector Mulligan.

                                        HILDY
                    We just need a minute of your time.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      JAMES and BETTY HARBACH slowly walk and talk with HILDY 
      and TERRY, down an alley, towards MLK. They are wearing 
        winter coats. James is eager to show them something.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      When Sarah got pregnant, she came to us 
                      for advice. We knew it was Kevin s. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    We told her to get rid of it. 

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      But Sarah wanted to keep it. She moved 
                      back here to the East Bay and started 
                      going to the 12-step meetings. They meet 
                    in the basement of that church.

      Betty indicates a CHURCH, visible at the corner.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      She was good for a while. We had our 
                      daughter back. She gave birth to a boy. A 
                      beautiful boy. We were grandparents. 

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      But the pressure got to her and she fell 
                      back into things with Kevin. Back into 
                      the drugs. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Course he didn t want that baby, couldn t 
                      even look at it for fear that it might 
                      shock him out of his drug-addled haze.

      They reach MLK BLVD, near the CHILDREN S HOSPITAL.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      Once he had Sarah nice and strung out, he 
                      snuck out with our baby grandson and 
                      dumped him right over there, in the 
                      hospital parking lot. Left him in a box, 
                      like a stray cat.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      The world s better off with Kevin dead.

      They turn and move down another alley, which moves under 
      the elevated 580 FREEWAY. Cars whiz overhead.

                                        JAMES HARBACH (CONT D)
                      They found Sarah s body right over there, 
                      under this overpass.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    We tried to find our grandson, but by 
                      then it was too late. He was sucked into 
                      the system. We couldn t find him no 
                      matter how hard we tried.                                                                                        34.


      Terry and Hildy share eyes, moved by the story.

                                        BETTY HARBACH (CONT D)
                    We lost our daughter and our grandson, 
                      our only family, right here, by our home, 
                    in the space of three city blocks.

                                        TERRY
                      You ever think about moving?

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Nah, the pain from losing a loved one, it 
                      ain t something you can run from. It s 
                      internal. It sticks with you forever.

      Terry is taken aback, as thoughts of Emily suddenly take 
      hold. Hildy notices.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      THE APPLICON G-500 is on the TARMAC, being gassed up and 
        loaded with a few bags. TERRY and HILDY exit the hangar 
      and cross the tarmac towards the plane s open door.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        Blount s JET descends over CATALINA ISLAND, towards LAX.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        A crowd of HOMELESS VETS mull around outside a VA CLINIC 
      on 3rd and Harrison, beneath a modern apartment complex. 
      They are smoking, talking, lined up for service.

      TWO UNMARKED CRUISERS idle across the busy street.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        WALTON S POV -- Business done, he exits the alley, 
        nervously looking around, head on a swivel. The BLUE 
      EAGLE TATTOO is clearly visible on his neck.

      ANGLE ACROSS -- TERRY AND HILDY exit their car, guns out. 
      Molk and Navarro are right behind them. They cross the 
        street from their cruiser, towards the alley. Molk and 
        Navarro flank from both sides. 

        Walton, sensing their presence, suddenly bolts.

                                        HILDY
                      Police! Freeze!

        WALTON SPRINTS, dodging pedestrians then suddenly 
        pivoting into an alley. Terry and Hildy give chase. Molk 
      and Navarro get tangled up in terrified pedestrians, 
        scattering at the sight of guns. 

      CLOSE ON HILDY -- She s angry, fearless, and ready to 
      take this guy down. She chases Walton, sprinting down the 
        alley, dodging homeless men and debris. 

      CLOSE ON WALTON ahead as he turns down another alley -- 
        looking back as Hildy follows, about 15 yards behind.

      ANGLE ON TERRY behind Hildy. He sees them turn the 
        corner, but stays straight, sprinting down the first 
      alley to flank them ahead.

      ANGLE ON HILDY right behind WALTON now. He sees her and 
      busts through an ALLEY DOOR, AND INTO--

                                                                              CUT TO:



        WALTON runs, flailing. Hildy pushes hard, her sidearm 
      out, sprinting after him, closing in. No sign of Terry. 
      But Hildy s surprisingly fast with an athletic gait.

        WALTON looks over his shoulder and sees that she is 
        making progress. He pushes, picking up speed. 

      They spill down a HILL, towards a FOUNTAIN. Walton again 
      LOOKS BACK, BUT THEN HE S ATTACKED FROM THE SIDE-- 

      TERRY TACKLES WALTON INTO THE FOUNTAIN.

      Hildy watches as they flail underwater. 

      Terry loses his grip. 

        Walton has the upper hand and REACHES BACK TO STRIKE--

      BUT HILDY FLIPS WALTON OVER, snapping his arm and 
        wrestling him to submission.

      She dunks his head in the water while Terry snaps 
        HANDCUFFS around his wrists. 

                                        HILDY
                      You re under arrest.

                                        WALTON
                      For what?

      Terry reaches into Walton s pockets and pulls out a zip-
      lock full of FENTANYL POPS. He shows them to Hildy.

                                        HILDY
                      For being an asshole.

      By the time Molk and Navarro show up, gasping for air, 
      it s all over.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      RAIN spills out of grey storm clouds, leaden by 
        moonlight. HEADLIGHTS approach us. Terry s CRUISER slowly 
        passes, parking in the driveway of his modest home. 

      He turns off the engine but doesn t get out. We watch 
        through the window as he sits, lost in his thoughts. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      STAN SHAW (35), Blount s uptight Mormon co-pilot, crosses 
      the tarmac towards the APPLICON JET. The plane is 
        attached to a FUEL TRUCK and being loaded with CATERING.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        WILKERSON and CINDY S LANDLADY (60) walk down the 
        sidewalk towards Cindy s Condo.

                                        WILKERSON
                      I knocked several times. Her car s in the 
                      driveway. She s been with me for three 
                      years and never once been late for work.

      They move up the driveway, past Cindy s RED JETTA to her 
      door. Concerned looks on their faces. Landlady knocks.

                                        LANDLADY
                      Cindy! 
                              (beat)
                    We should call the police.

                                        WILKERSON
                      It ll take them an hour to get here. Open 
                      the door.

      She knocks again. Then exhales and takes out her KEYS.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        --MATCH ON THE SUN, THEN PAN DOWN TO REVEAL-- 

        A GIANT CRIME SCENE. LANDLADY S POV now belongs to HILDY. 
      She s standing in the same spot, staring out the door. 
        UNIFORM COPS and EMT TECHS swarm the property. The street 
      is lined with CRUISERS, FIRE TRUCKS, and AMBULANCES. 

      Hildy turns back into the Townhouse. UNIFORMS work the 
      room, snapping photos, dusting for prints, collecting 
        evidence. Terry is by the body with an EMT TECH (40). 

                                        EMT TECH
                      Best guess is, it was an accident.

                                        TERRY
                      Couldn t she have been pushed?

                                        EMT TECH
                    If she d been pushed, she would have gone 
                      down the stairs head first. But she 
                      slipped backwards at the top, cracked the 
                      back of her head. 
                              (indicating)
                      You can see the indentation on her skull. 
                      And there s a blood mark on the top 
                      stair. That probably knocked her out. 
                      Then she tumbled down the staircase like 
                      a rag doll, hit her leg on the rail 
                      there, which caused that contusion and 
                      twisted her around. She landed on her 
                      neck. We can t confirm cause-of-death 
                      until the autopsy and toxicology report. 
                      They ll verify her injuries, and see how 
                      many pills she took. But the lady 
                      obviously fell down the stairs. 

      Terry and Hildy walk towards the front door. There s 
        tension between them, still lingering from Terry s 
        outburst with Walton.                                                                                        58.


                                        TERRY
                      Did Walton sign off on the confession?

                                        HILDY
                      Yes.

                                        TERRY
                      Are we okay?

                                        HILDY
                      You tell me.

      They stare out at the crime scene. On the front lawn, a 
        visibly shaken WILKERSON is giving his statement to a 
        UNIFORM COP.

                                        WILKERSON
                      She d never been late before. We knew 
                      something was wrong.

      Terry grabs a FRAMED PHOTO from the ENTRY TABLE next to 
      the door. He looks at it, then hands it to HILDY.

      ANGLE ON THE PHOTO: CINDY and ERICH BLOUNT, arms around 
      each other like lovers, standing in front of his jet.

                                        HILDY
                      Two deaths. 

                                        TERRY
                      One common denominator.

                                        HILDY
                        Coincidence?

                                        TERRY
                    No such thing.

                                        HILDY
                      What about Walton?

                                        TERRY
                      Guess we need to circle back.

      They share eyes, then stare back out at the wild scene.

                                        HILDY
                      Dust off your top hat. This is going to 
                    be a circus.

      Terry smiles. Then his cell phone BUZZES. He takes it out 
      and stares at the screen. His face is suddenly white, 
        drained of blood.

                                        TERRY
                      Emily.

      He stands there, frozen to the spot. Hildy pushes him.                                                                                        59.


                                        HILDY
                      Go!

      Terry snaps to and races out the door, to his car.

                                                                              CUT TO:
