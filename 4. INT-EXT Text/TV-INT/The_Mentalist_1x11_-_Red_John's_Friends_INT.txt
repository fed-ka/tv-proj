      The SWAT team moves cautiously through the graceful old 
      house. 


      THREE SWAT GUYS creep across a wide, bare hallway (used 
      partly for storage) in the old servant's quarters; toward a 
      closed door.  They reach the door, and one very carefully 
      tries the handle.  Locked.  The SWAT guys exchange hand-
      signals, prepping to go in...


      JARED RENFREW (30 s) sits on the edge of a bed, in a daze.  
      He s covered in blood.  Next to him on the bed is a bloody 
      knife.  In the other, he holds the cold dead hand of UNDINE 
      KOPECKI, a young woman lying dead on the bed in her 
      underwear, stabbed to death.  

      We note the old fashioned key in the door.  A small barred 
      window.  The closed door suddenly BURSTS OPEN, kicked in by a 
      masked SWAT GUY.  

                                  SWAT GUY
                    Down on the floor!  Down on the 
                    floor! 

      As the SOUNDS of a violent takedown continue O.S.,              
      WE MOVE IN CLOSE and stay on Undine's melancholy face. 


      MINELLI, Jane and LISBON sitting around the desk

                                    MINELLI
                    No.  I said no.  And I mean no.  
                    It's not that I don't want to help 
                    you.  I want to help you.  But it's 
                    not physically possible.  Jared 
                    Renfrew was tried and convicted.  
                    It's a closed case.  I have no 
                    authority to re-open it without 
                    cause.  

                                  JANE
                    There is cause.

                                    MINELLI
                    For you there's cause.  Not for the 
                    State of California.  We can't 
                    touch it.

                                  JANE
                    But we could --

                                    MINELLI
                    -- Closed case.  Nothing to be 
                    done.  The Justice Department 
                    doesn't go about undoing its own 
                    work.  

      Jane takes a beat, restrains himself.

                                  JANE 
                      I understand.  No problem. If we 
                    can't touch it, we can't touch it. 

                                    MINELLI
                    I'm sorry.

      Jane stands up to go.

                                  JANE
                    Hey, no.  The law is the law.  
                    My desire for revenge doesn't 
                    outweigh the rules.  I have to 
                    accept that.

                                  JANE
                    Thanks for your time.

      Jane exits.

                    Lying through his teeth, isn't he?

                          (rueful smile)
                    Yes.

                                    MINELLI 
                    Don't let him out of your sight.

                                  LISBON
                    Who am I, secret squirrel?  I'm not 
                    going to spy on him.

                                    MINELLI
                    But you have to keep him under 
                    control somehow.  

                                  LISBON
                    How?  This is the reason he's 
                    alive.  To find Red John. 

                                    MINELLI
                    He's going to go crashing into this 
                    thing and cause a huge mess.  I can 
                    feel it.  

                                  LISBON 
                    Probably.  It was bound to happen 
                    some day.  Nature of the beast.  
                    You knew that.

                                    MINELLI
                    Do you really want to lose him?  
                    Because that's what'll happen if he 
                    goes off the rails.  We lose him.     


      Jane enters, starts getting stuff together.  Lisbon glides 
      up.

                    Jane, I know better than to try and 
                    stop you from doing what you think 
                    you have to do.  

                                  JANE
                    No, no, I'm fine with it.  I can 
                    see Minelli's point.  I can't be 
                    running after every nutbag with a 
                    good story, can I?

      Lisbon doesn't believe him for a second.

                                  LISBON
                    Sure.  You're fine with it.  Will 
                    you do me the favor of listening to 
                    me for one moment?  So I can say I 
                    told you so later?

                                  JANE 
                    Yes.

                                  LISBON
                    Jared Renfrew was found hugging the 
                    corpse of Undine Kopecki in a 
                      windowless room, locked from the 
                    inside.  He was naked, high as a 
                    kite, with a bloody butcher knife 
                    in his hand.  His semen was found 
                    inside her.  He'd been stalking her 
                    for weeks.  He has a history of 
                    violence going back fifteen years.  

                                  JANE
                    What's your point?

                                  LISBON
                    He's guilty.  You're being conned.

                                  JANE
                    Possible.  I don't think so.  But I 
                    have to find out, one way or the 
                    other.  

                                  LISBON
                    Even if he's telling the truth 
                    about the murder, he could still be 
                    lying about Red John.     

                                  JANE
                    Also possible.  I have to take the 
                    chance.  What else can I do?

      Lisbon kind of leans back in a tacit acceptance that Jane 
      won't be stopped.  

                                  LISBON 
                    Minelli wants me to keep watch on

                                  LISBON
                    I'm not going to follow you around.    
                    Let's compromise.  When you get 
                    into trouble, call me first, so I 
                    can try and limit the damage.    

                                  JANE
                    Deal.

                                  LISBON 
                    And don't use your CBI ID.  That's 
                    the third rail.  The bureau finds 
                    out you used it without authority, 
                    you're done.  

                                  JANE
                    I hear you.

      Jane raises a hand in acknowledgement as he goes.  


      Amid elegant, but casual country club decor, GARDNER RENFREW 
      (late 30's) is an affable, but hard-nosed investment fund 
      manager type of guy.  Sitting alongside him is his regulation 
      issue pretty brunette Van Cleef and Arpelled WASP wife -- 
      BRECK (30's) -- who affects that non-committal half-smile of 
      the well bred lady.  Gardner looks at Jane with wary 
      suspicion.  He fingers a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, 
      but never uses them. 

      A HOUSEKEEPER puts a glass of water down in front of Jane.

                                  JANE

      Gardner's mad.  He goes all quiet and calm.

      Gardner stands, Breck follows suit.  But Jane is perfectly

                    Nothing would make me happier.  
                    But my brother is guilty.  He

      Jane looks around and heads for the most likely route to the 
      back of the house.  Gardner follows.  Then Breck, on the

                    was only here to help the cook with 
                    the dinner party.

      They enter...


      The room is empty now, except for the bed frame.  And a table 
      and chair.  Jane looks around.  Muriel watches him.

                                  MURIEL 
                    She was a lovely girl.  Full of 
                    life and promise.  Her mother 
                    Mariska had been with us for twenty 
                    years.  Part of the family. 

                                  JANE 
                    Jared says he and Undine were 
                    having an affair.  That he loved 
                    her.  Would never have hurt her.

                                  MURIEL 
                    Undine told her mother that he was 
                    stalking her.  She was scared of 
                    him.  She didn't go to the police 
                    out of respect for the family.

                                  JANE
                    I'd like to speak to her mother. 
                    Mariska, is it?

                                  MURIEL
                    She left our employ I'm afraid.  It 
                    was too difficult.  For both of us. 

                                  JANE
                    Where is she now?  

                                  MURIEL
                    I have an address somewhere.

                                  JANE
                    I'll need that.  

                                  MURIEL
                          (vaguely)
                    Yes, I'll have a look for it.

                                  JANE
                    Could you get it for me now?

      He says it with such charm that she obeys.

                                  MURIEL 
                    As you wish.

      Muriel exits to get the address.  


      Moving back out into the hallway, Jane looks around, noting 
      the stuff stored in the hallway (including fishing tackle).  
      He closes the bedroom door and kneels to study it at floor 
      level.  There's an inch gap at the bottom of the door.  Jane 
      puts his fingers under the door.  He takes the door key out 
      and examines it closely, then he peers through the keyhole.  
      Standing up, he has a big smile on his face, which fades when 
      he sees TWO BEEFY POLICEMEN are coming down the hallway.  
      Behind them, Gardner and Breck.

                                  POLICEMAN
                    Sir, would you come with us?

                                  JANE
                    Why?

                                  POLICEMAN
                    You're trespassing here.

                                  JANE
                    No I'm not.

                                  POLICEMAN
                    Okay, sir.  This man here is the 
                    home owner and he says you don't 
                    have permission to be here.  So 
                    let's go, partner.

                                  JANE
                    Officer, it's the other way around.  
                    I'm the home owner and that man's 
                    the intruder.

                                    GARDNER
                    That's a lie.  He's lying.

                                  JANE
                    Listen to the madness in his voice.  
                    Will you please take him somewhere 
                    he can get help?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    18.

      Muriel returns with a slip of paper at just this moment. 

                                  MURIEL
                    Here we are.  I don't know that 
                    she'll...
                          (sees policemen)
                    Oh for heaven's sake, Gardner. 
                      Policemen?  How ridiculous.  Send 
                    them away.

                                  POLICEMAN
                    Ma'am.  This man here --

                                  MURIEL
                    Yes yes.  It's quite alright, 
                    Officer.  You can go.

      She makes a peremptory shooing gesture at the Cop and offers 
      Jane the slip of paper.

                                  JANE
                    Thank you so much.  Goodbye, Mrs. 
                    Renfrew.  I expect we shall speak 
                    again soon.  

                                  MURIEL
                    Good day to you.

      He walks away.

                                    GARDNER
                    Mother...

                                  MURIEL 
                    Oh hush.
                          (to policeman)
                    I said you could go.


      Minelli in a bad temper, pacing.  Jane seated.  Lisbon 
      leaning in the doorway. 

                                    MINELLI
                    Gardner Renfrew is a player in this 
                    town.  You can't go to his house 
                    and screw around with him.  

                                  JANE
                    Why not?  It's a free country.    
                    I didn't use my ID.  I didn't 
                    mention the CBI.

                                    MINELLI
                    You gave your right name.  

                                  JANE
                    It's my name.

                    Well you should have lied as you so 
                    often do, because now I have to 
                    give you an official reprimand, and 
                    order you in the strongest possible 
                    terms to leave the Renfrew family 
                    alone and drop the whole matter.  

                                  JANE 
                    I'm sorry.  I can't do that.  

      Minelli sighs.

                                    MINELLI 
                    You have to.  This is straight from 
                    the AG's office.  

                                  JANE 
                    Jared Renfrew didn't kill Undine 
                    Kopecki.  

                                  LISBON
                    Do you have evidence of that?

                                  JANE 
                    Not yet.  I have pieces.  That I'm 
                    piecing together.  He's innocent.  

                                    MINELLI
                    Wake up, Dorothy, you're not in Kansas 
                    anymore.  There's innocent men in 
                    jail.  It happens.  Is he one of them?  
                    I don't know.  I doubt it.  In any 
                    case, we can't re-open his case.  

                                  JANE
                    If I'm Dorothy, who are you?

      Minelli considers that for a beat.  Lisbon smiles.

                                    MINELLI
                    Never mind who I am.  We'll find 
                    other ways of making Renfrew talk 
                    to you.  There's a lot that can be 
                    done to make a prisoner's life 
                    easier, if he cooperates.

                                  JANE 
                    That won't work.  He's innocent. 

                                  LISBON
                    You don't know that.

                    Okay, here it is.  If you pursue this 
                    any further, I'll have to throw you 
                    out of the CBI.  We can't take the 
                      liability.  I very much do not want to

                    you the trouble.  I quit. 

      He takes out his CBI ID card and tosses it on the table.

      FADE IN:


      At her desk, Lisbon's typing out a report.  She looks up to 
      find CHO, RIGSBY and VAN PELT standing at her desk with 
      solemn expressions.

                                  LISBON
                    Don't bother.  I know.  I feel the 
                    same.  Nothing to be done.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Now when he really needs our help, 
                    we're letting him down. 

                                  LISBON
                    I want to help him as much as you 
                    do.  Our orders state that we must 
                    leave this case alone. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    I don't care what our orders say.  
                    It's not right. 

                                  CHO
                    We need him boss.

                    We cleared cases before he came and 
                    we'll clear cases after he's gone.  

                                  CHO
                    Just not so many.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Cases are not the point.  It's not 
                    that we need him.  He needs us.

                                  LISBON 
                    Yes, but he needs our help on a 
                    fool's errand.  Renfrew's a conman.  
                    He doesn't know anything about Red 
                    John.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Suppose we found a connection 
                    between Renfrew and Red John?  

                                  LISBON
                    That would... Oh wait. 

      Lisbon has spotted the file in Van Pelt's hand that she is 
      about to present to Lisbon in triumph. 

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                          (smiling)
                    What's in the file?  Let me guess.  
                      A connection between Renfrew and 
                    Red John.

      Van Pelt hands over the file, blushing, but pleased with her 
      work.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Seven years ago, Renfrew was 
                    serving time on a narcotics 
                      conviction.  Shared a cell in 
                    Lompoc with a man named Orval 
                    Tanner.  Tanner claimed at his 1998 
                    trial for murder that he had only 
                    been an accomplice, that the real 
                    killer was a man who went by the 
                    name Red John.  Nobody believed 
                    him.  

                                  LISBON
                    98, near the beginning of Red

                    Of course.  Our luck.

                                  VAN PELT
                    It's a connection.

                                  LISBON
                    Slim.  Likely nobody believed him 
                    for a reason.

                    It's a connection.

      Beat.  Lisbon considers

                                  LISBON
                    Okay.  Check into Tanner's 
                      background.  Find the autopsy 
                    reports.  See if there's any 
                      credibility to his story.
                          (catching herself)
                    I mean, obviously we can't do that. 
                    But that's what I'd tell you to do 
                    if we weren't ordered to stay away 
                    from this case.    

      Long beat.  An understanding between the team members.

                                  RIGSBY 
                    I'm going to zap a taquito.  Anyone 
                    else want one?

      They all casually drift from the office and hasten to work.

      obviously been at it for a long while.

                          (tired, to phone)
                    Okay, then let me speak to 
                    assistant to the Deputy Records 
                    officer.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Why do people say Eureka when they 
                    do something good?

                                  CHO
                    It's greek for bingo.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Well so, eureka.  I found the 
                    autopsy reports and they back up 
                    Orval Tanner's story. The body of 
                    his alleged victim was cut up in 
                    the Red John style.  

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Which means Renfrew was telling at 
                    least some kind of truth about his 
                    Red John connection.

      Too late, they see Minelli enter and all switch to some other 
      mundane task with guilty looks.  Minelli cannot but be 
      suspicious.  He turns to the most vulnerable looking of them.

                                    MINELLI 
                    Van Pelt.  What's that you're 
                    working on?

                                  CHO
                    Sir...

      Minelli doesn't even look at Cho.

                                    MINELLI
                    I'm talking to Van Pelt.

      Long beat.  Van Pelt can't tell a lie to the boss.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Sir, I'm doing research for Jane.  
                    No excuses sir.

                          (to Rigsby and Cho)
                    You too, I suppose.

      Rigsby and Cho look studiously blank.

      Lisbon appears from her office.  She pretty much knows what 
      must have happened as soon as she sees their faces, but she 
      has to play it out...

                                  LISBON
                    Hey boss.

                                    MINELLI
                    I gave this unit a direct written 
                    order and they have flagrantly 
                    disobeyed that order.  Did they do 
                    this with your knowledge?

                                  LISBON
                    I ordered them to do it.  I told 
                    them that you countermanded your 
                    earlier order.  They had no 
                    knowledge whatsoever that they were 
                    doing anything irregular.  

      A mordant smile from Minelli

                                    MINELLI
                    Nice try, Mother Teresa, but they 
                    already gave themselves up.

      Rigsby clams up, silently cursing his big mouth.  Lisbon 
      glares at them all for idiots, to blow it so easily.

                                  LISBON
                    I stand by my story.  They didn't 
                    know they were out of line.  

                                  CHO
                    Sir, the opposite is true.  We 
                    forced Agent Lisbon to let us do 
                    this.

                                    MINELLI
                    Very touching.  My wife would love 
                    this scene in a movie.  
                          (angrily)
                    You're not cowboys.  You wear 
                    badges.  They mean something.  
                    I'm giving you all formal notice 
                    that any further infractions will 
                    result in immediate suspension.  

      Lisbon takes a deep breath, and jumps in the deep end.

                    Sir, you might as well suspend me 
                    now.  Because there will be further 
                      infractions.  Jane needs our help, 
                    and he's going to get it.  I'm not 
                    going to lay off just because some 
                    fat cat has put the pressure on.

                      RIGSBYCHO
      Me too. Me too.

                                  VAN PELT
                    And me.

      Minelli does a slow burn.  He studies his mutinous unit with 
      a clinical eye.

                                    MINELLI
                    Moving, eloquent, two thumbs up.  
                    You shall have your wish.  
                    You're all suspended, starting right 
                    now, for gross insubordination.

      Minelli exits, leaving them all stunned.


      Minelli comes in sits down at his desk, sets an executive toy 
      in motion.  Lisbon enters.

                                    MINELLI
                    Oh hi, Lisbon, still here?

                                  LISBON
                    Uh that was more of a rhetorical 
                    stand we were taking there.

                                    MINELLI
                    You take it back then?

                                  LISBON
                    Well, no.  But...

      The team eats pizza and goes over the case.  Van Pelt has her

                    Renfrew couldn't dispute the 
                    physical evidence.  The core of his 
                    defense was that he loved Undine 
                    deeply and would never have hurt 
                    her.  Undine's mother testified 
                    that was a lie.  I went to speak to 
                    her, but she's moved.  Left no

      Jane nods.  Van Pelt starts tapping at the computer.

                                  JANE
                    He had motive.  There's a moral 
                    turpitude clause in the family 
                    trust.  Once convicted, all Jared's 
                    shares in the family business went 
                    to Gardner.  But he would have also 
                    got the shares if Jared had died.

      which Van Pelt naturally goes to.  The CLIENT INDEX PAGE of a 
      healthcare company's master file COMES UP ON SCREEN. 

                                  JANE 
                    Exactly.  Why kill Undine?

                                  CHO 
                    Wanted to see Jared suffer maybe.  
                    Or had a thing for Undine himself.

                    Possible.

      Van Pelt looks up from her computer.

                    Eureka!

      They all turn expectantly.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT'D)
                    I just input Mariska Kopecki into 
                    the secure search engine.  I get an

                    which documents Mariska Kopecki's 
                      notification that she's changing 
                    her name to Vanna Clooney.  I input 
                    the new name and got a hit.  Four 
                    months ago someone named V.K. 
                    Clooney bought a condo in Marin.

                    Weird thing though.  The original 
                    IM came from a civilian.  
                          (looking to computer)
                    Doctor Joe in New Hampshire. 
                    He couldn't have been logged onto 
                    the DOJ secure network.  
                    So how did he know what I was 
                    asking about?  And how did he 
                    access the healthcare database? 
                    Nobody's allowed to do that.

      Jane, doodling on a pad, is abruptly alert.

                                  JANE 
                    When you say Doctor Joe in New 
                      Hampshire.  Do you mean D, R, J, O, 
                    E, N, H?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Ye -- Oh my God.  Oh my God.  

      They all gather around the screen.

      INSERT: The LAPTOP SCREEN.  The IM message board displayed.

                                  JANE 
                    Ask 'who are you?'

      Van Pelt types in the question.  They wait.  Then the IM taps 
      out a reply -- A LONG SERIES OF DOTS AND THEN A RED SMILEY 
      FACE.  Then more dots, then...'IS JANE THERE?'

      You could cut the tension with a knife.

      Jane takes the laptop.  He types - 'THIS IS JANE.'  After a 
      moment Red John replies - 'KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.' Jane types 
      back - 'WHY?'

      They wait and wait, but no reply.

                                  RIGSBY
                    What the hell was that about?  

                                  VAN PELT
                    He's somehow tapped into the DOJ 
                    secure network.  He's been spying 
                    on us. 

                                  LISBON
                    Can you trace the IM to its source?

      Van Pelt clicks away at the keyboard.  Shakes her head.

                                  VAN PELT
                    There's a self destruct code built 
                    in to the uplink, dead-ends at a 
                    secondary server.  There's no way 
                    to trace it back.

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Why does Red John want us to find 
                    Mariska Kopecki?

                    Because he wants us to succeed. 
                    He wants Jared Renfrew out of jail.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Out where he can get at him.  To

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Which means Renfrew is 
                    telling the truth.  He has the 
                    goods on Red John.

                                  LISBON
                    Take it easy, we've got nothing 
                    yet.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, we have to get Renfrew out of 
                    jail first.   

                                  LISBON
                    That's all.

                                  JANE
                    We will.  And then Red John will 
                    come after him.  He has to break 
                    cover.  He has to.  And we'll be 
                    waiting.  

      Jane's energized.  His eyes gleam with the thrill of the 
      hunt.  Lisbon looks worried.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Lisbon and Jane waiting at an apartment door.  Lisbon takes 
      out her badge wallet to show.

                                  JANE
                          (shakes his head)
                    Uh....

      Lisbon remembers, to her dismay, that she's not an agent. 
      Puts away the badge.  

                                  LISBON
                    Damn.

                                  JANE
                          (amused)
                    Yes, how are you going to get us in 
                    without your magic badge?

                                  LISBON
                    You do the talking.

                                  JANE
                    No, you try.

                                  LISBON
                    Don't be childish.  This is not...

      The door opens before Lisbon can say more.  MARISKA KOPECKI 
      (late 50's) is a Polish immigrant.  She's seen hard times, 
      and it shows, despite the designer label resort clothes and 
      botox.   

                                    MARISKA
                    Oh, I thought it was Harry.  Who 
                    are you?

                                  LISBON
                    Hi.  Vanna Clooney?

                    Yes?

      Lisbon tries a smile.

                                  LISBON
                    I'm Teresa.  And this is Patrick.

                                    MARISKA 
                    Yes?

                                  LISBON
                    Can, can we come in for moment?

                                    MARISKA
                    What d'you want? 

      Lisbon gives Jane a pleading look.  Jane looks around 
        conspiratorially and leans in close to Mariska.

                                  JANE
                    It's about Harry. 

                                    MARISKA
                    What about him?

                                  JANE 
                    Best not to speak out here in 
                    public.

      Mariska's curiosity gets the better of her.  She lets them 
      in.


      Mariska, Jane and Lisbon sit down in a showily perfect living 
      room, straight out of a 'classy' catalog.  Not a single 
      personal touch.   A harassed looking MAID moves slowly around 
      the room, dusting methodically while Mariska watches her like 
      a hawk.  We see a PICTURE of Undine and Mariska together; 
      mother and daughter smiling at each other outside their 
      shabby old house.  

                                  JANE
                    I lied just now.  We're here to 
                    talk to you about your daughter, 
                    Undine.

      Mariska stands up.

                                    MARISKA
                    Get out.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    36.

      Jane fixes her with a firm Jedi gaze.

                                  JANE
                    Sit down, Mariska.  Sit down.

      Mariska obeys.  

                                    MARISKA
                    Who are you?

                                  JANE 
                    Listen to me.  The guilt and pain 
                    and shame you feel won't ever go 
                    away.  It won't go away until you 
                    tell the truth.  

                                    MARISKA
                          (agitated)
                    What truth?  What are you crazy?  
                    You don't know me, you don't know 
                    what I feel. 

                                  JANE
                    I know you.  When you came to this 
                    country as a young woman, you 
                    dreamed of doing great things.  
                    What a life you'd have!  And what 
                    did fate bring you?  Twenty-five 
                    years of drudgery.  A servant's 
                    life.  You hated every day of it.

                                    MARISKA
                    Who wants to be a servant?  Nobody.

                                  JANE
                    You did it for her, for Undine.  So 
                    that she would have a better life.

                                    MARISKA
                    Yes.

                                  JANE
                    And then she was gone.  Taken from 
                    you.  In a flash, your whole life, 
                    all those days of drudgery and 
                      humiliation, wasted.  What a joke 
                    eh?

                                    MARISKA
                    Yes.  A joke.  Ha ha.  What do you 
                    want from me?

                                    MARISKA
                    Okay.  Jared killed her.  I don't

                                  JANE 
                    It's true, there's nothing you can 
                    do that will bring her back.  If 
                    you get paid to lie about what 
                    happened, where's the harm?    

      Mariska rubs her face. 

                                    MARISKA
                    What paid?  Nobody paid me 
                    anything.

                                  JANE
                    Don't lie to me.  Tell me the 
                    truth.  You took your twenty pieces 
                    of silver and bought the life you 
                    always wanted.

                                    MARISKA 
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    It's what you always wanted, but it

      Lisbon taking the call from Cho.  Jane pacing.

                    Okay.  Thanks, Cho.

      She hangs up the phone.

                    Samsa's dead.  Hit by a bus.

                                  JANE
                    Damn.  

                                  LISBON
                    We can get a court order for his 
                    records.   

                                  JANE 
                    You're on suspension, remember? 

                                  LISBON
                    Damn.  If we can't close this out 
                    before Minelli returns, we're done.

                                  JANE
                    Plan B then.

                                  LISBON 
                    What's Plan B?

      A JUNIOR DOJ LAWYER is passing through, pauses on seeing 
      Lisbon and Jane.

                                  JUNIOR LAWYER
                          (good humored)
                    Hey Lisbon, aren't you on 
                      suspension?  Does security know 
                    you're here?   

      Lisbon gives him a brief, deadly look.

                                  LISBON
                    Keep walking, Junior.

      The Lawyer keeps walking.

      Off Lisbon's look...          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    41.



      Muriel and Breck are with Rigsby and Lisbon.  Gardner enters, 
      angry.  

                                    GARDNER
                    This is ridiculous.  Who's the 
                    agent in charge here? 

                                  LISBON
                    I'm Agent Lisbon.  I think you 
                    already know my colleague, Mr. 
                    Jane.  

      Jane appears, from nowhere, it seems.

                                  JANE
                    Hello.  I expect you're wondering 
                    why I gathered you all here.

                                    GARDNER
                          (outraged)
                    Breck, go call the police.

      Jane lays on the Jedi firmness.

                                  JANE
                    Mr. Renfrew.  Wait.  If you don't 
                    want your family ruined in a deluge 
                    of sordid scandal, you'll listen to 
                    me.

      Gardner hesitates...

                                    GARDNER
                    What are you talking about?

                    Mariska Kopecki a lot of money to

      Gardner takes a beat to process that.

                                    GARDNER
                    So what?  The fact is they were 
                    found in a locked room.  It's not 
                      physically possible for someone 
                    else to have gotten into the room 
                    to commit the murder. 

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  There's the rub, isn't it.  
                    The key was in the door.  Watch 
                    closely.  

      Jane takes off his jacket (or some such flourish).

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Rigsby, go inside and lock the 
                    door, would you?

      Rigsby goes inside the little bedroom, locks the door.

      OUT IN THE HALLWAY -- Jane takes a rolled newspaper from his 
      jacket pocket.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Suppose Jared and Undine are in the 
                    room, asleep. 

      He takes one sheet of newspaper, and slides it under the 
      bedroom door.  Taking a pencil from his pocket, he inserts it 
      into the keyhole.  With a sharp tap on the pencil end...

      ANGLE:  The key is knocked out of the keyhole and falls onto 
      the sheet of newspaper.  Jane pulls the sheet back under the 
      door, bringing the key with it.  He picks it up, unlocks the 
      door, opens it to reveal Rigsby, smiling. 

                                  BRECK
                    That's all very clever.  But how do 
                    you get out again?

      Jane closes the door again, locks it, extracts the key.  
      Then, he takes a five foot long piece of nylon fishing line 
      from his pocket.  He threads one end through the keyhole, and 
      feeds the line through until one end is touching the floor.  
      There's just enough room under the door for Jane to reach 
      under the door, grasp the line between two fingers and pull 
      it through.  He then swiftly ties the door key to the line, 
      (with a little hitch around the haft so that it hangs right)  
      and pulls the line gently back through the keyhole until the 
      key is drawn up and into the hole with a satisfying click.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    43.

                    The line's still attached.

                                  JANE
                          (to Gardner)
                    May I borrow your lighter?

      Gardner is caught up in the show, doesn't think of refusing, 
      and gives Jane a disposable lighter.  Jane puts a flame to 
      the nylon line and in an instant it's gone without a trace.  
      Jane's very pleased with himself.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    That's how Jared was framed.  Cool 
                    uh? 

                                    GARDNER
                    Doesn't prove Jared's innocent, and 
                    it certainly doesn't prove anyone 
                    else is guilty.  It's a party 
                    trick.

                                  JANE
                    A party trick that a jury will 
                    love.  Put that together with 
                    Mariska's testimony, I think we 
                    have a pretty good chance of 
                    winning a new trial.  And then the 
                    truth will come out somehow I 
                    expect.  It always does.  Unless... 

                                    GARDNER
                    Unless what?

                                  LISBON
                    Unless we can work out some kind of 
                    financial deal here.  That would 
                    make it worth our while dropping 
                    the whole thing.   

      It takes a beat for this to sink in. 

                                    GARDNER
                    You want money?  You're trying to 
                    blackmail us?

                                  JANE
                    Call it leverage.

                                  MURIEL
                    But you're state agents.

                    Thanks to your son here.  Jane's 
                    being tossed out, and we're going

                                  JANE
                    Look, perhaps you should discuss 
                    this among yourselves.  How much is 
                    your family name worth?

                    You have until four o'clock to call 
                    me with an offer.  Then I'm going 
                    to start making some calls myself. 

      Jane, Lisbon and Rigsby walk away.

                    I'll tell you who I'm calling,

      Jane on his couch.  Lisbon, Cho, Van Pelt and Rigsby watching 
      the clock on the wall which says five to four.

      MONTAGE:  The murder of Undine.  Which begins with Muriel 
      seeing Jared and Undine kissing passionately, then locking 
      themselves in the little bedroom.  Muriel puts on a long 
      plastic raincoat over her evening dress... Montage ends as 
      Muriel holds the sample jar in a stream of Undine's blood.  
      Jared lies beside Undine all the while, unconscious from  
      drugs.

      END FLASHBACK


      CAPTION: TWO WEEKS LATER

      Jane, full of the vim and the thrill of the chase, walks past 
      Cho and Rigsby gathering weapons, vests, communications, to:          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    50.



      Jane bounces in.

                                  JANE
                    We're ready to go get Jared 
                    Renfrew.  Is the safe house 
                    prepped?

                                  LISBON 
                    Yes.  

                                  JANE
                    See you over there later then.

                                  LISBON
                    Jane.  Please be careful.  Remember 
                    this is playing out just like Red 
                    John wants it to.

                                  JANE 
                    It's playing out like it has to.  
                    He has no choice but to try and 
                    silence Renfrew.  He has to show 
                    himself.  We're getting close.  
                    I can feel it.

                                  LISBON
                    You can feel it?  Like a psychic 
                    thing? 

                                  JANE
                    I'm quietly confident we'll get a 
                    bite.

                                  LISBON
                    You think you're playing him.  
                    And he thinks he's playing you.  
                    One of you is wrong.


      Rigsby at the wheel.  Jane and Jared and Cho handling burgers 
      and fries and sodas in back. 

      A STREET PROTEST halts traffic.  A mob of young unruly 
      demonstrators carrying SIGNS -- MEAT IS MURDER, SAVE THE 
      EARTH, FUR IS EVIL -- surge toward the CBI vehicle.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    The hell is this?

      Cho and Rigsby look nervous.  The protesters eddy around the 
      CBI vehicle.  Using the mob as a distraction, Jared tosses 
      his soda all over Cho.  In the momentary confusion that 
      follows, Jared JUMPS OUT OF THE VAN AND RUNS through the mob.


      The whole team gathered in the tense stasis of waiting for 
      news.  Cho walks back and forth cursing himself.  Lisbon 
      briefs Minelli.

                                  LISBON
                    He vanished eight hours ago and 
                    we've heard nothing of him since.  
                    The town's on pretty good lockdown, 
                    so we're guessing he had friends 
                    that got him out of the area fast. 

                                    MINELLI
                    Planned it in advance probably.

                                  LISBON 
                    Yes.  Would you stop that?  It's 
                    not your fault.

                                  CHO

                    I must accept that.

                    What's done is done.  Focus on now.  
                    We have to find Jared Renfrew 
                    before Red John does.  Where would 
                    he go now?  Who are his friends?  
                    What are his options?

      Jane's PHONE RINGS.


      Jared sits on the end of a bed, holding a pink tiger skin 
      print cellphone to his ear.  Across the room, a dyed blonde 
      HOOKER is slowly and wearily taking off her clothes. 

                                  JARED
                    Mr. Jane, I'm calling to apologize 
                    for letting you down.

      INTERCUT JANE AND JARED:

                                  JANE
                    Hello, Jared.

      The team is galvanized.  Van Pelt starts tracking the call 
      via the computer. 

                                  JARED 
                    It's dishonorable, I know.  But 
                    crossing Red John is just too 
                      dangerous.  

                                  JANE
                    You already have crossed him.  You 
                    need our protection.

                                  JARED
                    I've given you nothing.

                                  JANE
                    How is he to know that?

                                  JARED
                    Oh he'll know.  He'll know.   
                    I told you, I have friends.  
                    They'll put in a good word for me.  

                                  JANE
                    Friends?  What friends?  Who?  






                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    54.

      CONTINUED:4545

                                  JARED
                    Wouldn't you like to know.  Thanks 
                    for giving me my life back. 
                    I'm grateful.

                                  JANE
                    Jared, listen to me.  They're not 
                    your friends.  You can't trust --  

                                  JARED
                    -- Vaya con dios amigo.  

      Jared turns off the phone, tosses it back to the Hooker, who 
      is now in her underwear. 


                                  JANE
                    Jared.  Jared...

      He puts down the phone.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Damned fool.  Friends he says.  Red John 
                    probably has his location already.  

                                  LISBON
                          (to Van Pelt)
                    Did you catch the line?

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Yes.  Tracking it now.  

                                  JANE
                    He's in Tijuana, Mexico.  In a 
                    motel room with a hooker.

                                    MINELLI
                    Because?

                                  JANE
                    He wouldn't call if he didn't think 
                    he was out of our reach.  I could 
                    hear Latin music and sirens and 
                    horns and a whole neighborhood in 
                    the background, which suggests thin 
                    walls and a city.  Hence, a Tijuana 
                    motel room.  

                                  LISBON
                    The hooker?

                                  JANE
                    He must be using somebody's phone.  
                    And he's been in prison for a year.  
                    Hence, hooker. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    The phone belongs to Juana Porfiria

                    Let me get a location on the call.

      Cho touches Jane's arm and makes a sizzling noise.

                                    MINELLI
                    I'll go reach out to the Federal 
                    police in Tijuana.  You boys come 
                    with me.

      Cho and Rigsby exit with Minelli.  A moment of clicking 
      silence while Van Pelt works...

                                  JANE
                          (to Lisbon)
                    Go ahead.  Say it.

                                  LISBON
                    Say what?

                                  JANE
                    You told me.  You warned me. 
                    Now you get the pleasure of saying 
                    I told you so. 

                                  LISBON
                    That's alright.  Not yet.  It's not 
                    over yet.  We're going to find 
                    Renfrew.  And he's going to tell us 
                    what he knows.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Got it!

      The room that Jared and the Hooker were in.  Now empty. 
      There's an ineffable sense that someone has just left the 
      room.  And a faint, but ominously unidentifiable SOUND from 
      the bathroom, which is lit, though we can't see into it.  
      There's a broad swathe of blood like a giant red brush-stroke 
      across the floor and into the bathroom.

      BOOOOM!  The front door is kicked in.  Rigsby and Lisbon 
      enter the room in a wary crouch, guns drawn.  Jane peers 
      through the door, waiting to see what happens.  

      Rigsby's the first to go into the bathroom.

                                  RIGSBY (O.S.)
                          (horror)
                    Oh no.  Oh.

      Rigsby exits the bathroom, goes out the front door and shouts 
      to accompanying Mexican Cops. 

                                  RIGSBY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                          (in Spanish with 
                            subtitles)
                    Red John was here, a moment ago. 
                    He's still close by.  We can catch 
                    him if we set up a perimeter fast.

      As Jane and Lisbon and CAMERA go to the bathroom, a couple of 
      UNIFORMED MEXICAN COPS enter the front door. 


      We get only an oblique glimpse of the bodies of Jared and the 
      Hooker in the bathtub, still warm, the last breath just gone 
      out of them. 

      Jared's finger still reaches out to the wall above the bath, 
      where he's written, in blood - 'HE IS MA.'


      While MEXICAN FORENSICS GUYS do their work, Jane and Lisbon 
      sit on the edge of the bed, weary and disconsolate and dirty, 
      like lovers after an illicit tryst. 

                                  JANE
                    You can say it now.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    57.

                    Don't really feel like saying it 
                    right now.  Let me take a rain 
                    check on that. 

                                  JANE

                                  JANE
                    It means Red John is far more 
                    powerful than I thought.  He's been 
                    way ahead of me the whole time.  

      She points to the bathroom.

                                  LISBON
                    I mean, the writing on the wall.  
                    "He is ma."

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  I have no idea.

                                  LISBON
                    It's a good clue though right?  
                    Jared was trying tell us something 
                      important. 

                                  JANE
                    Maybe.

      Beat.  Lisbon wants to give him a hug, he looks so sad.  But 
      she can't do that.

                                  LISBON 
                    Next time, we'll get him.

                                  JANE
                    Next time.

      Lisbon puts a consoling hand on his arm.  

      Suddenly, on the bedstand, the Hooker's PHONE BLASTS a 
      raucous snatch of CUMBIA.  Someone's calling.  

      Jane and Lisbon look at one another.  Jane's nearest.  He 
      answers it.  Listens.  Nothing said, but someone's there, 
      breathing.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    58.
