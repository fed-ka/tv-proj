    stand at attention on either side of a lectern, surrounded 
    by flower arrangements.  Sixtyfolding chairs are filled, 
    many of them byuniformed MEN and WOMEN in law enforcement. 
    Dexter stands among a group of mourners behind the chairs.

    At the lectern, Detective STEVE McNAMARA, 40s, brave and 
    dignified but torn up inside, talks into a microphone.

    AFTER THE SERVICE22

    Knee-deep in water, TWO ELDERLY COUPLES, the parents of the 
    deceased, spread their children s ashes in the ocean.  By 
    the shore, bereaved officers, friends, and family members 
    congregate and commiserateas they watch.  Doakes approaches

    SWING AROUND to find Lt. LaGuertaa short distance away, 
    giving sound bites to a TV NEWS CREW.

                      At least she knew he was a cop... 
                        unless, wait -- did you tell her?

    Debra smiles.

                      I m proud of you for coming, Bro.  I

                      I m managing.

    Debra gives his arm a sympathy squeeze then splits off. 
    Dexter turns to look out to sea, where the two elderly 
    couples are returning from spreading ashes.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      No I m not.  Keeping one s face 
                        pinched in sorrow for two hours 
                        straight is a real chore.

    Dexter s attention drifts to a CHILD using a red plastic 
    shovel to build castles in the sand.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Ooh, that reminds me.  I need to pick 
                      up a shovel for my next project.


    A batch of hardcore YOUNG MEN -- all races, sizes, and gang 
    affiliations, but none older than 21 -- are escorted by a 
    PRISON GUARD out the front gates of a low-slung, concrete 
    facility surrounded by high chain-link.  Excited families, 
    gangsters, and hoodrats greet them.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Florida prisons kick free 25,000 
                        inmates a year.  They don t do that 
                      for me, but it sure feels like it.

                        Like young Jeremy Downs.

    Dexter sees JEREMY, 19, hardened beyond his years.  He steps 
    through the gate, squinting into the sunlight.  The guard 
    escorts Jeremy, who has no one to greet him, into a van that 
    says  Homestead Halfway House.

    An Asian REPORTER stands in a park, holding a microphone.  A 
    GRAPHIC reads:  BREAKING NEWS.  SANDRAYEE.  MIAMI.   Police 
    cars can be seen behind her, along with yellow police tape 
    stretched out to keep a gathering CROWD out of the park.

                      It was a gruesome scene today.  The 
                        bloody body of a teenage boy found 
                        stabbed to death inside this South 
                        Miami park.

    PULL BACK to reveal that we are --


    Dexter sits shirtless behind his desk on a hot Miami night, 
    eating popcornand watching the archived NEWS REPORT on his 
    computer.  A gentle breeze billows the curtains behind him.

                        Police haven t released the name of

                        that investigators are holding a 15-
                        year-old suspect in custody.

                        alligators.  But once they were alone,

    Using the mouse, Dexter closes the window on-screen with the 
    news report and clicks on a folder with AUTOPSY PHOTOS.  He 
    starts flipping through COLOR STILLS of the dirty, bloody 
    body of a HEAVYSET BOY, 17, crisscrossed with deep knife 
    wounds.

                      To the coroner, the knife strokes 
                        looked random, impulsive.  But I saw 
                      the work of a young virtuoso.  Too 
                        many major arteries were severed...  
                        femoral, brachial, carotid.

    Dexter, staring with wide eyes, takes a bite of popcorn.  He 
    clicks the mouse and a PHOTO OF JEREMY in the courtroom 
    appears.  The boy has a smug smile on his face.

                      But I knew what he was, and what he d 
                      do again.  All I had to do was circle 
                      my calendar... and wait.

    PUSH INTO the bulletin board near the desk, where on the

    From a LOW ANGLE in the dirt, the new RED SHOVEL swiftly 
    STRIKES down on us.  Dexter, wearing jeans and a t-shirt, 
    wields the shovel.  He uses the sharp edge to hack at 
    something we can t see.  We can only imagine what, until --

    Frankie reaches to tousle Cody s hair, but Rita pulls her 
    son close, out of Frankie s reach.  With a knowing smile, 
    Frankie rises to his feet and gets serious.

                                        FRANKIE
                        Look... you want I could go into your 
                        house and throw around your furniture, 
                        make a real mess.  But what kind of 
                        message would that send to the little 
                        ones?  Just give me your fucking car.

    Dexter knows better than to challenge this guy with the kids 
    around.  He calmly turns to Rita, who s near tears.

                                        DEXTER
                        Maybe you should go get the keys.  
                        I ll wait here with our friend.

    Rita nods and herds the children inside.  Frankie turns and 
    stares daggers at Dexter, an imposing figure,holding the 
    shovel in his hands.

                                        FRANKIE
                        What?  Think you can take me?

                      In my sleep.

    Off Dexter s innocent expression --

    MOMENTS LATER

    Frankie recklessly backs down the driveway in the RAV4, 
    bounces over a curb and speeds away.  Dexter watches him go.


    CLOSE on a BLOOD SPATTER PHOTO that shows a vertical arc of 
    crimson blood stretching up a wall.  Dexter and ANGEL 
    BATISTA discuss the photo, pinned on a bulletin board. 

                                        DEXTER
                        That s not arterial spurting.  The 
                        drops are elliptical in shape.They 
                        were cast off by a weapon, something 
                      the killer swung overhead.

                                        BATISTA
                        Like, what?  An axe?

                      in on the left side?

    As Dexter shows Batista a CRIME SCENE PHOTO, VINCE MASUKA 
    enters the work area.

                        Yeah, but how great to pull a Bronco 
                      on that one, yeah?  Yeah?

    Dexter just stares at them blankly.  Batista explains --

                                        BATISTA
                        Mira aqu .  You do her doggy style, 
                        right?  Just when she gets into it, 
                      you grab her hips and yell another 
                        woman s name.  Bam, you re riding a 
                        bronco  cause she s trying to buck you 
                        off.

    Masuka, getting into the spirit of things, lets out a holler 
    and pretends to ride.  Dexter can only stare in amazement.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Many times in life, I feel like I m 
                        missing some essential piece of the 
                        human puzzle.  This is one of them.

    Debra runs up, looking for Dexter, and sees Masuka.

                                        DEBRA
                        What re you doing -- the Bronco?

    Debra excitedly turns to Dexter.

    An AERIAL SHOT circles a giant SportsArena.


    A row of colorful storefronts -- all the flavors of Miami.  
    Dexter stands outside a curio shop with a table out front, 
    full of assorted second-hand knickknacks.  Dexter holds up a 
    blown-glass POODLE to examine it.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Everyone moves to Miami to die, which 
                        means we have more junk than any city 
                      in America.  A skilled bargain hunter 
                      can find real treasure here -- Tiffany 
                        lamps, Steuben glass -- but that s not 
                      my idea of hunting.

    RACK FOCUS from Dexter s POVof the poodle to REVEAL Jeremy, 
    walking up the sidewalk toward Dexter, window shopping.



                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     17.

                        I prefer a stalk and ambush approach.  
                      My instincts are impeccable, but I 
                        have to be sure of my prey.

    Dexter curiously watches Jeremy stop to survey the wares of 
    a KNIFE VENDOR, 60s, a bit of a yahoo wearing an American 
    Eagle cap and surrounded by American flags.  He has set out 
    a couple card tables with rows of shining KNIVES, all sizes 
    and shapes, floating on dark velvet.

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                        What chain the market for?  You hunt 
                        trophies or meat?

                                        JEREMY
                        Excuse me?

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                        Well, trophy hunters, they re into the 
                      raw adrenaline rush...
                                  (redneckaccent)
                        Kill it till it dies, Billy Bob!
                                (then)
                        Meat hunters are looking for dinner.  
                        What reyou looking for?

                                        JEREMY
                      Can I see that one?

    Jeremy points to a SKINNING KNIFE with a 4-inch blade, not 
    the most impressive of the lot.  The vendor takes the knife 
    and deftly shows it off like a birthday party magician. 

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                        Good eye.  Fixed-blade skinning knife.  
                        Full-tang stainless steel.  Real time 
                        saver for hunters who like to do their 
                      own butchering in the field.

    Dexter drifts a little closer, as the knife vendor holds up 
    the skinning knife, which glints in the sunlight.

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                      See the way that blade curves gently, 
                        son?  Like an eagle s talon.  It s 
                        yours for fifteen dollars.

                                        JEREMY
                                (pulls out a twenty)
                        I ll take it.

                        wouldn t you?  I ll get your change.

    Jeremy delicately picks up the knife off the table to test 
    the weight, holding the handle with an expert backhand grip.  
    Abruptly, he SLASHES the empty air in front of him, once, 
    twice, then spins with the blade --

    -- and a HAND catches his wrist, stopping him in midswing.  
    The hand belongs to Dexter, now standing next to Jeremy.  
    The knife hovers two inches from Dexter s head.  CLOSE on 
    Jeremy s eyes -- cold, enraged, hungry.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        There it is.  The inhuman lizard-brain 
                        sense of I-Want.  I remember the first 
                        time I saw that look.

                        Easy, kid.

    The knife vendor turns to see Dexter holding off the knife.

                                        KNIFE VENDOR
                      Hey -- what the Sam Hill?

    Jeremy pulls his hand away.

                        I didn t see him.

    Jeremy takes off up the street, looking nervously over his 
    shoulder at Dexter.  The knife vendor turns to Dexter.

    woods with 15-year-old TEENAGEDEXTER.  They move in and out 
    of shadows as they talk.

    Harry turns and fixes his son with a probing look.

                      Not so great, Dex.  When you take a 
                        man s life, you re not just killing 
                        him.  You re snuffing out all the 
                        things he ll ever become.

    That reality hits Teenage Dexter.

                      As a police officer, I only fire my 
                        weapon to save a life.  That s a code 
                        I live by.  Killing has to serve a 
                        purpose.  Otherwise, it s just plain 
                        murder.

    Harry sees something on the ground ahead.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     20.

    Harry, troubled by his son s questions, has an idea to help 
    the boy cope with his emerging instincts.  Reluctantly, he 
    unsheathes a HUNTING KNIFE and hands it to TeenageDexter.

                        urges you feel.  Channel them.

    Teenage Dexter takes the knife, barely believing.  He steps 
    forward and kneels OUT OF FRAME.  PUSH INTO Harry, hoping 
    this is a good idea...

                        This deer will put meat on our table 
                        tonight.  It serves a purpose.

                                                                    END FLASHBACK:


    A tired Doakes fixes a cup of coffee.  On the counter, he 
    notices a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE on the memorial for fallen 
    officer Ricky Simmons and his wife Kara, with separate 
    photos of each.  Doakes picks up the story.  PUSH IN on 
    KARA s photo.  As he stares at his slain lover, Doakes is 
    flooded with anger.  It s time to do something about this.


    CLOSE on Doakes entering a Spanish courtyard.  FOLLOW him 
    through a crowd of mingling CHURCH MEMBERS, on the heels of 
    a Confirmation ceremony. 


                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     21.

    He moves through TEENAGERS dressed for Confirmation,
    receivinghugs and handshakes from FAMILY MEMBERS.

    Doakes scans the courtyard, until he spots --

    ROSE, 15, Latino, awkward but beautiful, wearing a virginal 
    white gown.  A Catholic BISHOP, 70s, full white hair and red 
    vestments, clasps her hand in his hands.

                                        BISHOP
                      I m very proud of you.  You worked 
                        hard for this.

                                        ROSE
                        Thankyou, Bishop.

    Rose smiles and steps away to find her friends -- but bumps 
    into Doakes, now strategically positioned in her path. 

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      Hi, Rose.  Congratulations on your 
                          Confirmation.

                                        ROSE
                        Thank you.  Do I know you?

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      My name s James Doakes.  Miami-Metro 
                      PD.  I m investigating the murder of 
                      an undercover officer and his wife.

                                        ROSE
                        That s terrible.  Were they members of 
                      the church?

    Rose couldn t be sweeter or more innocent.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                      No, Rose.  They weren t.

                                        ROSE
                                (confused)
                      Oh?

    Doakes pulls out a PHOTO of Ricky Simmons and holds it up.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Have you ever seen this man?

    In the background, for the first time we see kingpin CARLOS 
    GUERRERO and his wife CELESTE, talking to other churchgoers.  
    A Guerrero ASSOCIATE urgently taps his boss on the shoulder 
    and points out Doakes. 


                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     22.

                        I don t know.  Why are you asking me?

                                        GUERRERO
                        Hey!  Getaway from my daughter!

    Doakes turns to see Guerrero angrily racing over, pushing 
    people aside.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        What?  C mon...

    Trying to provoke Guerrero into a fight, Doakes holds up his 
    hands, like  Take a shot.   Guerrero pushes people aside and 
    lunges at Doakes to do just that, but some of his associates 
    wisely hold him back.  Guerrero strains to get to Doakes --

                                        GUERRERO
                        Atmy church?  In front of my family?

                        Rickyand Kara had families, too.

    Everyone in the church has turned to watch.

                                        ROSE
                                (scared)
                        What s he saying, Daddy?

                                        CELESTE
                        Come on, honey.  Let s go.

    Celeste escorts away Rose.  Guerrero forces down his fury, 
    shrugs off the associates holding him, and faces Doakes.

                                        GUERRERO
                      You just opened a dangerous door.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Naw, man.  You did.  When you murdered 
                        a cop.  And an innocent lady.  You 
                        don t follow the rules, Guerrero.  Why 
                        should I?

    The Bishop calmly approaches.

                                        BISHOP 
                        This is a placeof worship, officer.  
                        I need to ask you to leave.  Go in

    Guerrero s men step aside to let Doakes exit.  As hewalks 
    down the center of the courtyardwithout turning back --

    OMITTED2020


    Little Havana.  The heart of Cuban Miami.  A time warp into 
    an alternate reality of hand-rolled cigars, fruiterias, meat 
    markets, and windows with cafecitos for only 25 cents.

    At a corner traffic light, four motley hookers in slinky 
    dresses and strappy heels -- SHANDA (Black, attitude), 
    GABRIELLE (Latino, trashy),BELLA (Latino, demure), and a 
    FOURTH HOOKER -- lift their skirts to display their wares.  
    Appreciative drivers HONK.  

    Debra, wearing her business suit, approaches the girls on 
    the street.  They turn and break out familiar smiles.

                                        SHANDA

    The girls laugh.

                      I m a cop.

    The girls look at each othernervously.  The Fourth Hooker 
    turns and bolts, doing her best to run in high heels.

                                        DEBRA

                        Your department got him out of there 
                        faster than you can say Jacko, thank

                        Yeah but the damage was probably done.  
                        Lemme guess -- he got bounced from 
                        placement to placement, committed a 
                        crime, ended up in juvie.

                      You should keep the faith.  The system 
                        works, now and then.  I was taken in 
                      by a wonderful family.  No abuse.  In 
                        fact, my foster father understood I 
                      had special needs.  Without him...

    Rita comes running up the driveway, panting and smiling and 
    looking eternally grateful to Dexter.  She mouths  thank 
    you  to him as she leads Laura into the house.

                        I am lucky.  What do I know about 
                        abuse?  Without the Code of Harry, I m 
                        sure I would ve committed a senseless 
                        murder in my youth.  Just to watch the 
                        blood flow.

    A rundown boarding house with a sign that says:  Welcome to 
    Homestead Halfway House. Jeremy and a somewhat frail boy 
    named LUCAS -- an 18-year-old runt of the litter -- exit the 
    house joking and laughing.  

    OMITTED3030            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     35.




    CLOSE on the faces of Jeremy and Lucas behind chain-link.  A 
    REVERSE ANGLE reveals that they re staring into a secluded, 
    marshy area.  A  NO TRESPASSING  sign on the fence.

                                        LUCAS
                        I don t know, Jeremy.

    Lucas looks nervous.

                                        JEREMY
                        What s wrong?  I thought you wanted to 
                      see an alligator.

                                        LUCAS
                        I do.

                                        JEREMY
                        Well come on, it s in the marsh.

                                        LUCAS
                      No.

    WAY DOWN THE STREET

    A familiar car sits under a tree.


    Dexter sits inside, shadowing Jeremy.  He watches as Lucas 
    overcomes his fear and starts climbing the chain-link to 
    break into the marsh.  Dexter raises binoculars for a better 
    look.

    LONG-LENS POV

    As Jeremy climbs, his shirt lifts and Dexter spots the GLINT 
    of the skinning knife strapped to Jeremy s hip.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Bingo.  I know what happens next in 
                        this gruesome little scenario.  Jeremy 
                      is trying to recreate his first kill, 
                        ritualize it.  I ve got what I need.

    As Dexter puts his binoculars back in the case, PAN to the 
    front window, through which we see the boys in the distance 
    clear the high fence and run off into the marsh.            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     36.




    An extremely LOW ANGLE, an inch above water, gazing out over 
    the blackness of a swampy WATER HAZARD.  On the far side, 
    close to the water, stand Jeremy and Lucas.  It all feels 
    creepy.

                                        LUCAS
                        I don t see it.

    Jeremy points right INTO CAMERA.

                                        JEREMY
                        It s right there.  See its eyes 
                        sticking up?

    AT THE WATER S EDGE

    Lucas looks into the murky water.  Jeremy stands slightly 
    behind him.

                                        JEREMY
                      You have to get closer.

    Lucas nervously steps right to the water s edge.  Any closer 
    and he d fall in.  Lucas looks out over the water.

                                        LUCAS
                        I still don t see it.

                                        JEREMY
                        Really?  Huh.  Maybe I was wrong.

    Lucas looks back at the bigger boy, suddenly realizing.

                                        LUCAS
                        There s no gator here, is there?

    Jeremy shrugs.  Dark.  Menacing.

                                        JEREMY
                        I don t know, Lucas.  Is there?

    It s a tense, uncomfortable moment.  Lucas is helpless.  He 
    knows it.  We know it.  Jeremy smiles, the smile of a 
    predator in control --

                                        VOICE
                        Excuse me!

    They turn to see Dexter materializing out of the trees as he 
    walks toward them.  He strolls right up to the boys, who are 
    frozen by his sudden appearance.

                                        DEXTER
                        Anyone see aFrisbee?  It flew in here 
                        somewhere.

    Jeremy impulsively takes off running.  Lucas follows a beat 
    behind.  Dexter watches the boys run away.  After they flee 
    from sight, he looks around at his surroundings.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        What am I doing out here?

    Dexter is about to head back, when he hears a SPLASH behind 
    him.  Dexter turns -- as a 12-FOOTALLIGATOR lunges out of 
    the water.  Dexter leaps away but trips, falls, and quickly 
    scrambles back to his feet.

                                        DEXTER
                      Son of a bitch!


    Dexter, angry and wet, limps across the empty parking lot.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      All I had to do was drive home.  Have 
                        a taco.  Plan my attack.  Instead, 
                        dearly deluded Dexter tried to act 
                        human.  Like it s myjobto save 
                        lives.

    He reaches his car -- to find the passengerwindow SMASHED.  
    Oh hell.  Dexter opens the door and more glass falls from 
    the window.  Dexter checks the glove box.  Emptied out.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      The Code of Harry never covered this.  
                      At least I know what Jeremy is -- and 
                        what I need to do.

    As Dexter angrily slams the glove box closed --

    Debra roams the sidewalk alone, searching the street.  
    Weaving through HOOKERS hawking their wares.  CUBANO MEN 
    sipping espressos.  TEEN RUNAWAYS looking for handouts.

    ACROSS THE STREET

    She spots a classic Fleetline STATION WAGON, light color 
    with paneled wood sides, trolling the street in SLOW MOTION.

    AN SUV

    Pulls up, blocking Debra s line of sight.  She runs around 
    the SUV and bolts into the street.  A car SLAMS ITS BRAKES, 
    nearly hitting Debra.  The DRIVER curses out the window.  
    Debra holds up a hand, sorry, and races across the street, 
    forcing another car to swerve and HONK.

    AT A STOP LIGHT

    She reaches the rear of the Fleetline Station Wagon stopped 
    at the light and hurries along the side, trying to peer in, 
    but the windows are tinted.  When she reaches the passenger 
    window, which is rolled down, Debra looks inside --

    -- and sees a wrinkled ANCIENT MAN behind the wheel, with 
    his AGED WIFE riding shotgun.  She smiles a creepy toothless 
    smile at Debra and waves in SLOW MOTION, as the light turns 
    green and the Fleetline drives away.  Off Debra -- 


    A plain-wrap SEDAN cruises through an oasis of quiet stately 
    homes in Coral Gables.  It pulls to a stop outside a house.            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     47.




    Doakes follows the cops out, still holding his mask.

                      Yo listen up, I showed my face to

                        He s gonna think I was behind this.

    One clown jumps up and down, testosterone flowing.

                                        COP FRIEND
                        That s part of the plan, dumb-ass.

                                (confused)
                      The plan?

    McNamara puts a friendly arm around Doakes.

                                        DET. MCNAMARA
                      You fuck my sister.  You fuck a cop s

                              (he starts laughing)
                        ...you re just fucked, buddy.

    The other clowns join McNamara in derisive laughter as they 
    turn like three linebackers from a huddle and bound up the 
    walkway toward the house, leaving a tortured Doakes by the 
    car.  He hears the door BUST OPEN, furniture THROWN, then a 
    man YELLING. 

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        Shit, man.

    Doakes throws the clown mask into the car, backs away, then 
    turns and hurries down the sidewalk.  As CRIES OF PAIN and 
    SOUNDS OF A BEATING echo behind him --


    The rundown boarding house is mostly dark.  We hear the 
    SOUNDS of a classic arcade game, along with a current 
    ALTERNATIVE MUSIC song.


    Doakes exits the police station.  Across the street, he sees 
    a DANCING CLOWN -- with floppy shoes, a big nose, and full 
    face makeup -- waving around a HUGE SIGN that says  Condos 
    for Sale.    

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Harry taught me that death isn t the 
                        end.  It s the beginning of a chain 
                        reaction that will catch you if you re 
                      not careful.

    As Doakes walks by staring, the Dancing Clown stops dancing.  
    He eerily looks Doakes in the eye, holds his fingers in the 
    shape of a gun, and fake fires at Doakes.  A message from 
    Guerrero.            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     55.




    CLOSE ON a stream of water.  PULL BACK to find lovely Rita 
    watering the vibrant new LEMON TREE in front of her house.

                      But there was something Harry didn t 
                        teach me.  Something he didn t know.  
                        Couldn t possibly know.

    On the sidewalk, Astor and Cody sit behind a crude homemade 
    Lemonade Stand with a pitcher of ice-cold lemonade and cups.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      The willful taking of life represents 
                      the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

    The family hears a CAR HORN play  Hallelujah  and they turn 
    to see Dexter pulling into the driveway in a 1970s Cadillac
    convertible, pimped out with chrome spinners and airbrushed 
    artwork, including a sanguine picture of Jesus on the hood.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      It leaves you an outsider.  Forever 
                        looking in.  Searching for company to 
                        keep.

    CLOSE on Dexter s keys hanging from the ignition -- with the 
    BARBIE DOLL HEAD from the Ice Truck Killer attached as a 
    keychain.

    Astor and Cody and Rita run over to check out the car, which 
    says  ChristoSalva  on the back. Dexter gets out to greet 
    them.

                        Actually it s yours.  Until your mom 
                      can afford a new one.

                        Borrowed it from impound.  Right 
                        before auction.

    He slips the key off the BarbieDoll Head keychain and hands 
    it to a misty-eyed Rita.

                      You better.

    Dexter watches the overjoyed children hop into the car and 
    feel the red-velvet seats.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      All you can do is play along at life 
                      and hope that sometimes you get it 
                        right.

    Dexter looks back at the luminous Rita, who is staring at 
    him, touched beyond words.

                                        RITA
                        Thank you...

    Her eyes brim with tears as she kisses Dexter.

                        Score one for the little wooden boy.

    Dexter puts his arm around Rita and they turn to watch the
