                    to turn that project over to my 
                    foreman.  I got real busy.

                                  ALEX
                    And Brad fired you.  Because you 
                    were sleeping with Cindy.

                                  PETE
                    That was a factor too.  Can I be 
                    honest?

                    The Laughlin project wandered into 
                    a moral gray area but have you seen 
                    their kitchen?  I knocked it out of 
                    the park. 

                                  ALEX
                    Cindy was very impressed. 

                                  PETE
                    And I think Brad was too.  In his 
                    heart of hearts. 

      They enter the kitchen.  It s cramped and out-dated.  Alex 
      rolls out some plans.  Through out the following, Pete is 
      doing a walk-thru; inspecting counters, opening cabinets, 
      running the sink, etc..
