It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest
floor.
BELLA (V.O.)
"... Which, as they kiss, consume..."
SUDDENLY A FOOT SLAMS DOWN next to the tulip, nearly
crushing it. As the foot immediately lifts off again, it
grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off --
ON THE RUNNING PAIR OF FEET
They abruptly change direction. Race on. INCLUDE BELLA
SWAN, desperately searching the woods -- SHORT, SURREAL CUTS
of her frenetic quest --
BELLA
Edward!
Ahead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she SEES
SUNLIGHT; a clearing. She hurtles toward it --
BELLA
Edward!
2.
-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight. It's the meadow where
Edward revealed his skin in the sun. But he's not here now.
Instead, Bella SEES --
ACROSS THE MEADOW -- AN OLD WOMAN, white hair framing her
withered face. Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she
recognizes --
BELLA
... Gran?
GRAN looks as surprised as Bella. Bella smiles and waves,
as does Gran. Bella starts toward her but --
EDWARD (O.S.)
Bella...
She spins to the voice behind her to SEE --
EDWARD emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp
contrast to the shadows. She beams at him, relieved, in
love... until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from
sun's rays --
BELLA
Stop - she'll see!
But Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight.
Sunbeams SHATTER off his skin like a thousand rainbow
shards, as if he were made of diamonds. An awesome sight.
JUMP CUT TO: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening,
entrancing her. She wraps an arm around his waist, then
arranges her face into a calm expression. They turn to --
Gran, whose expression is calm, too. Gran's arm is
extended, as if she also holds someone.
JUMP CUT TO: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now.
Bella's about to present Edward, but then SEES that --
Gran mimics Bella's movement exactly. With growing horror,
Bella reaches out to Gran... and touches glass!
PULL BACK TO FIND Gran is now surrounded by a GILDED FRAME.
It's a MIRROR, mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a
surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella.
BELLA
Oh my God.
-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five
years older.
3.
Bella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward.
He takes her now WRINKLED, age-spotted hand. Kisses it.
Then he leans in very close to her 83-YEAR-OLD FACE and
whispers into her ear --
EDWARD
Happy birthday.
SMASH TO:
An AERIAL VIEW of this lush, green, overcast landscape; the
rainy world that is Forks. FIND Bella's old truck as it
lumbers down the two-lane highway...
BELLA (V.O.)
It was just a dream... but also my
worst nightmare.
Bella climbs out of her truck, shouldering her book bag.
She looks around the parking lot, seeking Edward --
MIKE (O.S.)
Wherefore art thou, Bella?
She turns as MIKE, ERIC, ANGELA and JESSICA approach.
MIKE
You finish the Shakespeare assignment?
JESSICA
He means will you finish his
assignment?
MIKE
No, I don't -- okay I do.
BELLA
I can help you with it -- but first --
(pulling out her camera)
I need a picture. My mom's expecting
a scrapbook full of memories.
ANGELA
(holds up her own camera)
I take `em, I don't pose for `em.
BELLA
You do today.
5.
She pushes Angela to the others; they arrange themselves --
JESSICA
You'll photoshop my nose if it looks
big, right?
ERIC
Don't worry, I'm in the picture; no
one will be looking at you guys.
Jessica scoffs, Angela points her camera at Bella; Mike and
Eric joust -- Bella aims --
FULL FRAME - THE CAMERA'S DIGITAL SCREEN
It FREEZES on them, fun, delightfully carefree... but when
the camera lowers, their playfulness has dissipated as they
see someone behind Bella. She turns to see --
EDWARD climbing out of his silver Volvo.
MIKE
(dry)
Oh good. Cullen's here.
JESSICA
(drier)
Yay.
The friends, uncomfortable, move off --
ERIC
Check ya later.
-- But Bella doesn't register their tone. She's transfixed
by Edward who approaches, eyes never leaving hers. He
reaches her, washing away all her concerns --
EDWARD
Happy birthday.
-- except that one.
Her face falls.
BELLA
Don't remind me.
EDWARD
Your birth is definitely a day to
celebrate.
BELLA
Not for me.
6.
EDWARD
Eighteen is a little early to be
worrying about your age.
BELLA
It's one year older than you.
EDWARD
Bella, I'm ninety.
BELLA
True. Maybe I should be creeped out
that I'm dating such an old guy.
EDWARD
(smiles, amused)
Yes, it's the age that's creepy, not
the fact that you're dating a vampire.
Then he kisses her, tenderly, adoringly. She kisses him
back... despite their restraint, the passion mounts... until
he pulls away. As always, both are left wanting more.
Edward nods toward the school building --
EDWARD
Class.
BELLA
Right.
Class.
Catching their breath, they start toward school... but
Edward stops, hearing something in his mind. Irritated.
EDWARD
Someone wants you.
JACOB (O.S.)
Bella!
JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long,
black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall,
muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy,
still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward,
who moves off to the side but eyes them.
BELLA
God, Jacob, what are they feeding you
on that rez, steroids? You're huge.
JACOB
Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came
around more.
7.
BELLA
I will, soon. But isn't your school,
like, ten miles that way?
JACOB
(re: car part)
Just here buying this for the Rabbit.
I'm almost done with the rebuild.
Gotta come take a ride when it's done.
(as if remembering)
Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad
told my dad. So...
He pulls from his coat a small woven DREAMCATCHER, feathers
dangling from it. He hands it to her.
JACOB
I saw it the other day and thought of
you - it catches bad dreams.
BELLA
This, I need. It's great.
EDWARD
The bell's about to ring.
The bell RINGS. Jacob gives Edward an amiable smile, with
just a hint of snark.
JACOB
Ooh, look at you, all psychic.
EDWARD
I don't have that particular gift.
But I can read a watch. I'm clever
that way.
They share a tight smile.
Bella intercedes, squeezing
Jacob's arm.
BELLA
Bye, Jake, and thank you.
Edward guides her away.
As they walk off --
EDWARD
How come Jacob Black gets to give you
a gift and I don't?
BELLA
He's just a friend.
8.
EDWARD
"Friends" don't spend two weeks
looking for the perfect dreamcatcher.
BELLA
Stop reading his mind if he bothers
you so much.
EDWARD
Little hard to tune out.
She just laughs, but Edward looks back at Jacob with
resentment. Jacob holds his gaze.
Lights glow from inside the beautiful house.
EDWARD (O.S.)
The Volturi are a very old, very
powerful family...
The truck stops.
Beat.
BELLA
You can't protect me from everything -
something's going to separate us --
accident, illness, old age... as long
as I'm human...
EDWARD
(appalled)
That's your solution?
My ending your
life?
BELLA
Your giving me forever.
He faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented.
She reaches for his hand --
BELLA
Carlisle told me how you feel, about
my soul, but I don't believe that --
-- he subtly moves his hand away from hers.
EDWARD
You should go in. It's late.
He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side
door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face -
he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek.
BELLA
I'll leave my window open for you.
EDWARD
(quietly)
I won't be coming back.
Not tonight.
BELLA
Then... can I ask for one thing?
It's
still my birthday.
(off his nod)
Kiss me?
20.
He lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins
carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with
an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye.
Abruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks
off into the night. Off Bella...
ON BELLA THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of her truck as she pulls
into the driveway. She climbs out, heads toward the house
but stops, relief washing over her --
BELLA
Edward.
You're here.
He stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows
when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask.
EDWARD
Walk with me?
21.
Edward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets
him guide her toward the woods...
Edward stops by a fallen tree.
Turns to Bella.
EDWARD
We need to leave Forks.
BELLA
What?
Why?
EDWARD
It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be
ten years older than he looks; people
will start noticing.
BELLA
But... when?
EDWARD
Now.
Bella reels, trying to take this in.
Finally --
BELLA
I'll have to think of something to
tell Charlie, but I can be ready --
EDWARD
Not you.
Us.
BELLA
(stunned)
What? -- no -- Edward, what happened
with Jasper - that was nothing.
EDWARD
Nothing compared to what could happen.
You don't belong in my world.
BELLA
-- I belong with you --
EDWARD
-- You don't --
BELLA
-- I'm coming --
EDWARD
I don't want you to come!
22.
Bella is stung, as if slapped.
BELLA
You don't... want me.
EDWARD
No.
She steps back.
Trying to understand this.
EDWARD
I'd like to ask one favor though.
BELLA
(looks up, hopeful)
Anything.
EDWARD
Don't do anything stupid or reckless --
do you understand?
(adding)
... for Charlie's sake. Just... take
care of yourself.
BELLA
I... yes... I will.
He softens ever-so-slightly.
EDWARD
Don't worry. You're human. Time
heals all wounds for your kind.
Particularly if you're not reminded.
Desperation wells up in her, overwhelming dignity.
BELLA
No, this is - don't do this.
Please.
He sees she won't let go easily.
Takes a breath.
His face
turns cold again.
EDWARD
Try to understand. Every second with
you is about restraint. You're too
fragile. I'm tired of pretending to
be something I'm not. Reining myself
in so I can be with a human.
BELLA
Then take my soul. I don't care!
I
don't want it without you --
23.
EDWARD
(sharply)
-- You're not good for me, Bella.
Bella looks at him.
His hard face.
His resolve.
EDWARD
I've let it go on too long.
I'm
sorry.
Tears sting Bella's eyes. This can't be happening. He
steps forward... kisses her forehead. She closes her eyes.
EDWARD
I promise, it will be like I never
existed. Goodbye, Bella.
And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing
this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see.
By the time she opens her eyes - he's gone.
She spins --
BELLA
-- Wait --
She SEES a LEAF FLITTERING to the ground where he grazed a
branch; the only indication of his direction. She hurries
down the path, then runs --
BELLA
Edward?!
-- and she keeps running, going deeper into the woods...
A SERIES OF QUICK, SURREAL SHOTS - TIME LAPSING
Bella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her
opening dream. It gets darker and darker, until we're deep into
night -- HEAR Bella's sharp desperate BREATHS --
BELLA TRIPS. Falls to the damp forest floor.
She looks up,
the trees spinning around her...
STAY ON BELLA - NIGHT - AS HOURS PASS
She remains on the ground. Curls into a ball.
Darkness
shrouding her. Devastation paralyzing her.
ECU ON HER FACE - numb. HEAR the faint sound of her name
being called in the distance. A search party. She's too
wrecked to respond.
Rain begins to pour; she doesn't register it....
24.
SERIES OF SCENES END ON -- BELLA, lying there, dazed. She
begins to HEAR an animal SNUFFLING. It gets closer. It
sounds large. Scary. Then she hears a whisper --
EDWARD (O.S.)
Move, Bella.
She lifts her head, looks for Edward... but SEES something
else instead --
BELLA'S POV - A DARK SHAPE, huge, black. Nearing. Its EYES
reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage.
Bella, terrified, manages to DRAG herself to a cluster of
trees. She squeezes between them. Breathing hard. She
closes her eyes, trying to disappear...
Half the town is gathered - a tired rescue party that
includes Mike Newton and Jacob Black.
Charlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with
BILLY BLACK (in wheelchair) and Quileute HARRY CLEARWATER,
46, (dark braids, stout, protruding belly, kind face).
CHARLIE
I'll call the Cullens again. Her note
said she and Edward went for a walk.
BILLY
They left town, Charlie.
HARRY CLEARWATER
Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job
somewhere else.
Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder.
HARRY CLEARWATER
We'll find her, Charlie.
Charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends.
JACOB
Charlie!
Charlie spins to where Jacob points --
25.
THEIR POV - THE EDGE OF THE WOODS
SAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with
cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella.
BILLY
It's Sam Uley. He found her.
Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life.
He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms.
CHARLIE
Thank you, Sam. Thank God.
Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and
Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs
away, avoiding any accolades.
ON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with
worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he
turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable,
quickly looks away.
ON CHARLIE CARRYING BELLA up the stairs to the house --
CHARLIE
What were you thinking, Baby?
Why
were you out there?
BELLA
He's... gone.
Off her as Charlie carries her inside --
BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY - A MONTH LATER
The leaves have turned red and orange.
SEE a FIGURE in the
upstairs window --
A one-story contemporary home, surrounded by snowy, barren
land and woods. Through a LARGE PICTURE WINDOW we SEE Alice
and Carlisle, arguing inside --
BELLA (V.O.)
But I'm sure it's better for them, not
having me around...
(Visuals are jumpy, unclear) START HIGH ON A MOUNTAINTOP in
the middle of nowhere. SWOOP DOWN to its peak on which we
find EDWARD. Standing still, face agonized.
ALICE (O.S.)
... is to be alone...
-- and suddenly, he starts running, like he's trying to
outrun his memories, faster and faster -- he races toward a
CLIFF; a RAVINE hundreds of feet below --
Edward doesn't slow, just blasts forward faster; then he
LEAPS off the cliff, FLOATING, but the pain stays with him --
ON EDWARD'S FEET landing hard on the other side of the
ravine - as they hit ground we --
SMASH BACK TO:
CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGERS
-- as they hit computer keys --
BELLA (V.O.)
Time passes. Every tick that goes
by... aches...
29.
Bella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing
trash into the bins. He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who
also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles.
CHARLIE
It's about time you got rid of those,
Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared
on the highway.
BOB
Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the
garbage truck hauls `em off, you and
my wife can rest easy.
(starts off, but stops)
Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear
problem? Folks are saying they're
huge.
CHARLIE
(distracted)
That's just... talk...
-- as Charlie watches Bella walk to her truck, head down.
Bob sees her, too --
BOB
How you doin' there, Bella?
30.
Bella, in her own world, doesn't respond.
Bob gives Charlie
an understanding shrug and heads off.
ON BELLA as she opens her truck door.
Suddenly, it gets
slammed shut again by Charlie.
CHARLIE
That's it.
BELLA
That's what?
CHARLIE
You're going to Jacksonville to live
with your mother.
BELLA
What?
Why?
CHARLIE
I just - don't know what to do any
more. You don't act like someone left
you; more like someone died.
She looks away.
That's how it feels to her.
BELLA
I'm not leaving Forks.
CHARLIE
Bells, the bastard's not coming back.
She nods.
Knows this all too well.
CHARLIE
It's not normal, this behavior. And
frankly, it's scaring the hell outta
me, and your mother.
(gentler)
Go to Jacksonville, Baby. Make some
new friends.
BELLA
I like my old friends.
CHARLIE
You never even see them anymore.
BELLA
I do, too. In fact, I'm... um...
Jessica and I are going to Port
Angeles tomorrow. Shopping.
31.
CHARLIE
(suspicious)
You hate shopping.
BELLA
That's how good a friend I am.
CHARLIE
(somewhat appeased)
Alright. Shopping.
BELLA (PRE-LAP)
Hi Jessica, it's Bella...
Bella and Jessica exit the theater.
A MARQUEE behind them
bears the title of a ZOMBIE film.
BELLA
I don't get why are there so many
zombie movies.
JESSICA
It's, like, a metaphor? For crass
consumerism or something.
Bella glances at her.
JESSICA
Not that you'd know anything about
consuming. You didn't buy anything
today.
BELLA
I bought something.
JESSICA
Socks don't count. `Course, I was
surprised you even called.
BELLA
I've been kind of... out of it.
32.
JESSICA
Kind of? I mean, at first I was
worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's
still bumming? It's not like I wasn't
going through things, too. Like Mike
deciding he wanted to "just be friends?"
That was really hard and --
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
How `bout a ride, girls?
As Bella looks ACROSS THE STREET, time suddenly SLOWS --
BELLA'S POV - A DIVE BAR, "ONE EYED PETE'S" (SLOW MOTION)
-- FOUR ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS loiter out front next to their
motorcycles. They're in shadow, we can't see their faces.
OFF BELLA WE SMASH TO --
FLASHPOPS: Bella surrounded by FOUR GUYS ("Twilight");
Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down --
BACK ON BELLA, a chill going down her spine, FREEZING her as
she stares at the foursome across the street...
Then suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear --
EDWARD (O.S.)
Move, Bella.
She turns to find Edward standing next to her. Or so it
seems. But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes
clear when --
Jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and
TIME ABRUPTLY SPEEDS UP AGAIN --
JESSICA
Come on.
BELLA
I know them... I think...
JESSICA
Can we just go --
Jessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off.
BELLA
I want to see something.
33.
Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the
street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn.
GUY #1
Alright, we got a taker.
The apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time.
She stops.
EDWARD
Turn around, Bella.
This is
dangerous.
But when she steps backward, he fades. Testing her
hallucination, she strides forward again -- Edward's
apparition reappears, strides alongside her --
EDWARD
Stop.
Now.
She's almost smiling as she reaches the Guys, finally able
to see them clearly -- and stops, realizing --
BELLA
... You're not them.
And with that.... Edward disappears.
GUY #1
We'll be whoever you want, honey.
Guy #2 pulls up right next to her on his motorcycle.
GUY #2
Ready for a thrill ride?
GUY #2 extends his hand to help her onto the bike.
She
hesitates.
EDWARD (O.S.)
Walk away.
Go.
Edward's apparition appears on the other side of the bike.
Bella looks at him with determination -- then climbs on to
the back of the bike --
BELLA
I can break promises, too.
GUY #2
(confused)
... Okay.
34.
JESSICA
Bella!
The bike LURCHES forward, going way too fast. As the wind
blasts her hair back, she realizes this might have been a
mistake --
BELLA
... Wait
Guy #2 doesn't hear her, guns the engine, going faster --
BELLA'S POV - DIRECTLY AHEAD
Edward stands in road, directly in their path, more present,
more clear than ever. The bike's headlight illuminates him,
racing toward him --
BELLA
Stop - stop! - STOP!
The bike abruptly pulls up short.
GUY #2
Hey, I didn't force nothing on you.
Bella scrambles off, stumbling in the process.
Edward is
gone.
The four Guys then REV their bikes and PEEL out.
Bella
watches them go as Jessica storms up.
JESSICA
What the hell is wrong with you?!
BELLA
(almost to herself)
I... saw something.
JESSICA
You.
Are insane. Or suicidal.
BELLA
(trying to figure it out)
The more dangerous... the more real it
was.
JESSICA
So, what, you're like an adrenaline
junky now? Go hang-gliding or bungie-
jumping. Don't be a complete freak.
35.
An angry Jessica charges off. Bella watches the motorcycles
disappear down the street as --
BELLA (V.O.)
He wasn't real. I knew that. I
didn't care. I needed to see him. If
danger's what it took, that's what I'd
find.
Off Bella, determination settling into her face...
Bella pulls up in her truck, a tarp covering something big
in the back. Jacob comes out of the house. A huge grin.
JACOB
Bella!
Bella hops out, Jacob gives her a hug.
Bella's surprised by
his affection, but doesn't mind.
JACOB
`Bout time you came by.
BELLA
I brought you something.
Bella pulls the tarp back, revealing - her neighbor's two
dilapidated, rusting MOTORCYCLES.
JACOB
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.
BELLA
I rescued them from the dump. They'd
cost more than they're worth to fix...
unless one had a mechanic-type friend.
JACOB
Me, being the mechanic-type friend?
(off her shrug)
Since when are you into motorcycles?
BELLA
Recently.
JACOB
(studying the bikes)
The parts alone will be pricey.
BELLA
I have a college fund I can dig into.
36.
JACOB
Charlie's gonna love that.
BELLA
Charlie won't know.
JACOB
Wow. Lying to Dad. Blowing through
college money. Repairing dangerous
machines - that I'm guessing you'll
want to ride?
BELLA
I really get it if you think this is
stupid and reckless.
JACOB
Oh it's totally stupid and reckless.
(leans closer, grins)
When do we start?
Bella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a
while... a wide smile. As they pull the bikes off the
truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought
Bella back to life. But --
UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND JACOB FROM A DISTANCE
-- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes
into the garage. REVERSE on the watcher to discover --
Next to Sam stand two others, JARED, 17, and PAUL, 18. All
three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs. It's
unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in
their eyes, the danger.
Sam turns; the others follow his lead. The three slink
soundlessly into the darkness of the woods...
SMASH TO:
Two hikers, NATE and TIM, 20's, as they tromp through the
shadowy, mist-laden woods. Tim studies his IPhone GPS --
TIM
We're going the wrong way.
NATE
Who cares?
Enjoy the scenery.
37.
TIM
(slapping a mosquito)
And the West Nile virus.
Tim hears a RUSTLE.
Stops.
TIM
You hear that?
NATE
If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd
have brought my grandma.
TIM
Could be one of those giant bears.
NATE
There are no giant --
RUSTLE. Nate stops. Then, from the opposite direction,
another RUSTLE. Then another, and another, from behind,
from in front. It's either more than one creature or it's
moving with extraordinary speed. The guys are terrified.
TIM
What the hell is that?!
NATE
I don't know!
The guys, faced away from one another, search the trees.
STAY ON TIM as suddenly, there's an eerie SILENCE. Beat.
TIM
Think it's gone?
No answer.
He turns to find that Nate has vanished.
TIM
Nate?
Nate!?
Nothing... then the RUSTLING starts again.
And intensifies.
Tim BOLTS! CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too
scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face. Breath
ragged, he looks over his shoulder --
TIM'S POV - BEHIND HIM - something gives chase, flattening
foliage and bending thin trees in its path. Tim runs harder --
TIM'S POV - UP AHEAD THROUGH THE TREES - THE HIGHWAY
A couple cars pass.
Civilization.
Safety.
Tim races for it --
38.
Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement,
he`s going to escape --
BAM! Something YANKS him out of frame at an unnatural
angle. His SCREAM is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing
but a disturbing silence...
DISSOLVE TO:
Bella and Jacob exit, make their way across the yard to her
truck. Bella seems lighter, happier than before.
JACOB
Quil keeps asking to come over. I
think he likes you a little too much.
BELLA
Tell him I'm not into the cougar
thing.
JACOB
What is it with you and age? I mean,
that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem
to... bother you.
He instantly regrets saying Edward's name as he sees it
crush her spirits. Off Bella, retreating into herself...
BELLA (V.O.)
Not even Jacob could keep away the
nightmares...
41.
Bella TEARS through the forest, searching desperately. Then
she turns -- finds Edward a few yards away, his face cold.
She steps toward him -- but he BOLTS backward, suddenly
twenty yards away --
BELLA (V.O.)
... the terror, the loneliness.
-- he rapidly retreats further until he disappears, leaving
Bella utterly alone, darkness closing in on her...
-- Bella runs toward them.
But Jacob's laughter slows her.
JACOB
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.
BELLA
What, on purpose?
JACOB
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
BELLA'S POV - A DIVER (Paul) takes a running start and
FLINGS himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down.
Bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for
Edward.
JACOB
Most of us jump from lower down.
BELLA
Think I could?
JACOB
Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?
BELLA
You said it was a rush.
44.
JACOB
Maybe on a warmer day. And not from
the top. We'll leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.
There's that bitter edge again.
She looks at him.
BELLA
You don't like them.
JACOB
They think they run this place.
Acting
all bad ass, calling themselves
"protectors."
BELLA
What are they protecting?
JACOB
The tribe, the land, their right to be
jerks. Embry used to call them hall
monitors on steroids; now look at him.
Bella looks closer, SEES the fourth guy is Embry, hair now
shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone. It
pains Jacob to see him.
BELLA
That's Embry? I didn't recognize him.
What happened to him?
JACOB
He missed some school - then, out of
nowhere, he's following Sam around.
Same thing happened with Paul and
Jared. They weren't even friends, now
Sam owns them.
(beat)
Sam keeps giving me this look, like
he's waiting for me or something; it's
kinda freaking me out.
BELLA
Maybe you should just avoid them.
JACOB
I try but...
She sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly.
BELLA
Hey.
If it gets worse, we'll go to my
Dad.
Or you can come stay with us.
45.
JACOB
Thanks.
(beat, holding her)
If this is how you're going to react,
I'll freak out more often.
Bella realizes she crossed a line and covers, playfully
shoving him. As they head to the truck, Bella looks back --
BELLA'S POV - ON SAM
-- but now he's looking directly at her. Then he turns and
DIVES over the edge, cutting a clean line into the water.
The bike is aimed down a dirt road.
Jacob runs through the
instructions:
JACOB
Brake?
(she taps it)
Clutch?
(she squeezes it)
Right. Gas?
(she grips it)
You ready?
Bella nods.
Jacob grins... then KICK-STARTS the bike.
JACOB
Slowly... release the clutch.
She does... the bike moves forward an inch -- Jacob
cautiously steps back. She moves forward another inch --
EDWARD (O.S.)
Stop.
Bella turns to find the apparition of EDWARD standing next
to her. Her hand slips off the clutch, the bike BUCKS and
falls on top of her. Jacob quickly lifts it off her as the
apparition of Edward disappears.
JACOB
You okay?
Bruises, breaks -- ?
BELLA
I'm going again.
JACOB
I'm not sure that's a good --
Bella quickly rises and hops back on.
JACOB
Guess we're going again. Now what are
you going to do with the clutch?
BELLA
Release it.
Slowly.
Jacob nods. Then kick-starts the bike again. She releases
the clutch and moves forward. Slowly at first -- EDWARD
reappears at her side, glowering.
48.
She keeps going, a little faster. EDWARD appears on her left
now; she passes him. He reappears ahead; she passes.
ON BELLA'S FACE as the wind flings her hair back. She
gathers speed... and for a moment, experiences pure freedom,
exhilaration... then she sees Edward standing at the curve
in the road ahead, and realizes --
BELLA
(yelling to Jacob)
I don't -- how do I turn!?
JACOB
Bank it!
Bank - hit the brake!
Jacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank,
goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees.
As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up.
JACOB
What, are you training for the X-games?
She looks around for Edward.
He's gone.
BELLA
I want to go again.
JACOB
Forget it. I'm revoking your
motorcycle privileges. Man, look at
your head.
Indeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his
shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away --
BELLA
God, I'm sorry.
JACOB
You're apologizing for bleeding?
BELLA
It doesn't... bother you?
JACOB
It's just blood, Bella.
He bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds
herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and
smooth skin. He glances at her.
49.
JACOB
What are you staring at?
BELLA
Just, you're actually... good looking.
He's surprised; there's a moment between them.
He smiles.
JACOB
How hard did you hit your head?
BELLA
(realizing)
Oh I - yeah.
He offers her a hand, helps her up.
She holds onto it,
alarmed.
BELLA
Jake, you're hot.
JACOB
Upgraded from good looking?
BELLA
No, temperature hot.
(feels his forehead)
You're burning up.
JACOB
I feel fine.
He takes her hand from his forehead.
Holds it.
She tries
to pull it away.
JACOB
What?
I can't hold your hand?
BELLA
It just... means something else to you
than it does to me.
JACOB
One, that's my problem. But two... we
have fun, you think I'm hot --
BELLA
Good looking.
JACOB
I know you like me.
50.
BELLA
More than anyone.
But... that's all.
JACOB
Because of Cullen?
The name stings her.
He takes both her hands now.
JACOB
Look, I know what he did to you. I
can see it in your face every time his
name comes up. But you need to know -
I would never, ever do that to you. I
promise I will never hurt you. You
can count on me.
BELLA
I already do. You don't know how
much. You're my best friend but... I
don't think my feelings will change.
He takes this in, it's hard. A wave of something sweeps
over him. He sits back. Closes his eyes, takes a breath.
BELLA
I'm sorry. I should've said something
right from the start --
JACOB
No. That's not -- I just feel...
weird.
BELLA
I told you, you have a fever.
Probably that flu everyone has.
JACOB
It doesn't... feel like flu.
I don't
know what it is.
Off Jacob, rattled, and Bella, concerned...
Bella climbs out of her truck, SEES the empty spot where
Edward used to park. SEES Eric and Angela canoodling.
Couples everywhere. She puts her head down, hurries to
class. BEEEEP --
BELLA (O.S.)
Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono.
He won't let me visit but... would you
call me?
SERIES OF CUTS - Bella tries to navigate her way to the
meadow. She refers to a map, a compass.
BELLA (V.O.)
I was more afraid of the hole in my
chest than I was of bears. Without
Jacob, I needed Edward more than
ever...
Bella tries a trail; it doesn't look familiar.
Backtracks.
Tries another.
BELLA (V.O.)
... I needed to know he existed.
There was only one place I might find
him, or the feeling of him...
FLASHPOP - THE MEADOW - Edward and Bella lie in the grass
surrounded by flowers, sunlight dappling them. They look
lovingly into one another's eyes...
BACK ON BELLA - the memory and her desperation fuel her.
Finally, she sees a clearing ahead, hurries toward it --
-- Bella steps into the clearing, hopeful... but her face
falls. In contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow
is cold, gloomy, cloudy. And no Edward. She closes her
eyes, trying to force Edward here.
Nothing.
Her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow.
Bella sinks to her knees. Tears threatening. But then she
hears a RUSTLING noise. She turns toward it, peers into the
woods.
Another RUSTLING NOISE comes from another part of the woods.
She spins toward it -- nothing. Then she turns and JUMPS
when she finds --
Vampire LAURENT standing just ten yards away.
Dreadlocks,
chiseled face. Bella can't believe it.
53.
BELLA
Laurent?
LAURENT
Bella.
She beams, realizing he's real.
BELLA
Laurent!
LAURENT
I must admit, I didn't expect to find
you here.
BELLA
I live here. But you - I thought you
were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.
LAURENT
Tanya, I was. It was kind of him to
arrange, given my association with
James and Victoria, "The Enemy."
BELLA
You tried to help us.
Laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes
assessing her as --
LAURENT
I went to visit the Cullens, but their
house is empty. I'm surprised they
left you behind. Weren't you sort of
a pet of theirs?
Bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her.
BELLA
Um... something like that.
LAURENT
Do the Cullens visit often?
Suddenly, EDWARD'S apparition appears between them.
EDWARD
Lie.
BELLA
Absolutely.
All the time.
54.
EDWARD
Lie better.
BELLA
I'll tell them you stopped by.
Edward fades (throughout, he'll reappear when he speaks,
then fade again). Bella tries to look relaxed.
BELLA
Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?
LAURENT
I don't think so. Tanya's "vegetarian"
family was pleasant enough. But the
dietary restrictions were difficult -
living on nothing but animals.
Suddenly, he's standing inches from her.
She now sees his
EYES. Dark blood-red.
LAURENT
(conspiratorial)
Tell me Bella. Do you ever feel
compelled to... cheat?
Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him.
LAURENT
But that's not why I left. I came
back here as a favor to Victoria.
BELLA
... You're still friends.
LAURENT
(shrugs)
More or less. She asked me to get the
lay of the land with the Cullens.
Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria
is quite put out with you.
BELLA
That's... too bad.
LAURENT
Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill
Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
Eye for an eye, mate for a mate.
And now Bella knows.
Terror overwhelms her.
Edward appears --
55.
EDWARD
Threaten him.
BELLA
Edward will know who did it.
He'll
come after both of you.
LAURENT
I don't think he will. After all, how
much could you mean to him if he left
you here unprotected?
(then)
Victoria sent me here for information.
She won't be happy about my killing
you.
BELLA
No, Laurent...
LAURENT
(sincere)
No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm
doing you a kindness. Victoria plans
on killing you slowly, painfully -
whereas I'll make it very quick.
(inhaling)
And you smell so... mouth watering.
He faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building.
Her
eyes dart around, escape is impossible --
The only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward, looking
at her with alarm...
BELLA
(whispering, barely
audible)
Edward. I love you.
Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his
expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind
Bella - and it terrifies him.
LAURENT
I... don't believe it.
He steps back. Bella's confused as she realizes he's no
longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly
turning... to find behind her --
AN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the
woods. It stalks towards them, a low disturbing GROWL in
its throat, sharp teeth gleaming.
56.
Bella is trapped between the two killers.
Edward whispers
in her ear --
EDWARD
Don't.
Move.
The wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where
she stands, then --
FOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking
the black wolf. They're the size of small horses, all of
different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet-
brown. Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched,
ready to spring.
Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. The RUSSET-
BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her. Laurent
continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously --
-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow --
-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her
in pursuit of Laurent! Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS
shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding
him before he reaches the treeline --
Laurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf, SMACKING the wolf
half-way across the meadow. Another wolf lunges at Laurent -
he kicks it and it sails into a tree, SPLINTERING it.
The two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes
in on Laurent. It's impossible to know who will prevail --
Bella doesn't stay to find out.
She RACES into the woods --
-- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside,
tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running --
-- Bella DASHES out of the treeline and to her truck parked
on the shoulder. She jumps in, PEALS out --
Bella knocks.
Then knocks again.
Finally, Billy answers.
BELLA
Hi, Billy.
I know Jacob's sick but --
BILLY
He's out with friends.
BELLA
(taken aback)
Oh.
BILLY
I'll let him know you came by.
Billy starts to close the door, but Bella stops him.
BELLA
Wait -- he's got mono, right?
That's
what you told my dad.
BILLY
(with compassion)
You should go on home, Bella.
And he closes the door.
Off Bella --
RAIN now pours down. Billy, inside, pulls the curtain back,
looks out at Bella with sympathy. Then closes the curtain.
-- behind Jacob stand Sam Uley, Jared, Paul and Embry.
They're oblivious to the rain, wear minimal clothes.
BELLA
You cut your hair.
JACOB
Go away.
Jacob turns away. Sam leads the group toward the house.
Jacob follows. She, and we, note his sure-footed strides;
his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight. She grabs
his arm.
BELLA
What happened to you?
He stops, turns back. The others wait on the porch for him.
They're out of earshot, but won't leave him alone with her.
BELLA
(lowers her voice)
I can help.
His face is hard as he shakes his head.
He's not talking.
BELLA
Sam got to you. What did he do?
JACOB
Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.
BELLA
Then who?
JACOB
(bitterness seething)
How `bout those filthy, reeking
bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens.
BELLA
(thrown)
I... don't know what you're --
JACOB
You know exactly what I'm talking
about.
He's shaking, almost convulsing with anger.
She regroups.
60.
BELLA
The Cullens are long gone.
How are
they to blame?
JACOB
They started all this by existing.
Goddamn leeches --
SAM
Jacob.
Jacob glances at Sam, who gives him a look.
Jacob takes a
breath, trying to calm himself.
JACOB
I can't be friends with you anymore.
BELLA
Jake, I know I hurt you. I should
have been more up-front but -- I
needed you, I still do. I don't know
what that means yet, but if you give
me time --
JACOB
Stop.
Don't. It's not you --
BELLA
-- "It's not you, it's me?"
God.
JACOB
It's true.
I'm not... good.
BELLA
You're wrong --
JACOB
It doesn't matter.
This is over --
BELLA
I can't take losing my best friend, too.
JACOB
You already have --
BELLA
Don't say that -- you promised --
JACOB
Go home, Bella. Don't come back.
He practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear
inside. Off Bella, standing in the rain...
61.
-- It paces, watching Charlie slowly close the door...
SMASH TO:
Jacob, shirtless, clings to the top of a tree which bends
with his weight. Bella opens the window, whisper-yelling --
BELLA
What the hell are you doing?
JACOB
Get out of the way.
He begins to swing his legs, increasing momentum.
She
realizes what he's about to attempt --
BELLA
No!
He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility --
Bella parks. Climbs out of her truck. The moon eerily
illuminates the clearing. Forest NOISES encroach.
She hears a RUSTLE amid the trees. Spooked, she freezes --
then SEES JACOB emerge from the trees. A moment as their
eyes meet. Then --
Sam Uley, Paul, Embry and Jared step into the clearing, as
well, half-clothed, movements almost synchronized. Their
expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see
Bella. Paul spins on Jacob.
PAUL
What the hell have you done?!
JACOB
I didn't tell her.
You'd know if I
did.
PAUL
She's here, isn't she?
SAM
Bella, there's nothing to see here.
You should go home.
BELLA
Not until I know what you did to Jacob.
PAUL
(advancing on Bella)
What we did?!
Jacob moves in front of Bella protectively, facing Paul.
SAM
Both of you, calm down --
JACOB
Sam, she knows things about the
bloodsuckers. She's been on the
inside. She can help --
PAUL
Like a leech lover's gonna help us.
66.
JACOB
Watch what you call her.
EMBRY
Get a grip, guys --
But Paul and Jacob are so angry, their bodies begin to
shake, nearly convulse. It unnerves Bella --
BELLA
It's alright, Jacob, I'll go --
Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing.
PAUL
All you care about is her --
SAM
(commanding)
Paul, back off.
PAUL
-- and she doesn't give a crap about
you --
Jacob flashes anger, PUSHES Paul, hard.
Paul FLIES backward.
SAM
Jacob.
Paul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl,
vibrating violently --
JARED
Too late.
SAM
Bella, get back!
Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud
RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming
a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring!
Bella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him --
BELLA
Run, Jacob! --
But he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf --
BELLA
Jake, no!
Stop -- !
67.
Jacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp
TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur
BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic
russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf.
Bella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other,
snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING.
Their teeth flash at each other's throats.
Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves
beyond the clearing and into the woods --
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into
the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS
of the fight still ECHO --
BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Sam starts after them, kicking off
his shoes.
SAM
Take Bella to Emily's place.
Sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet.
A long silence...
EMBRY
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
Off Bella, stunned.
Bella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny,
weathered house with a window box full of marigolds. Jared,
in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door. He and Embry
head toward the house. She doesn't move.
EMBRY
(to Jared)
Pay up. She didn't puke.
Jared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks.
EMBRY
Told you she was tough.
She does run
with bloodsuckers.
BELLA
Wait. We should go back, make sure
Jacob's okay.
JARED
I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.
Serve him right.
68.
EMBRY
No way. Jake's a natural. You see
him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver
says Paul doesn't touch him.
JARED
Easy money.
Paul's been at it longer.
Bella looks at them, appalled.
They realize she's not
following them.
EMBRY
Come on in.
We won't bite.
JARED
Speak for yourself.
Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.
Embry
pauses at the door --
EMBRY
Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance -
just try not to stare. It bugs Sam.
BELLA
Why would I stare? --
-- But the guys are already entering --
The sun is just beginning to rise, reddening the clouds
overhead. Bella paces by the cliff's edge, trying to come
to grips with this new reality. Jacob keeps his distance,
trying to control his anger.
BELLA
You just have to... stop.
71.
JACOB
It's not a life-style choice.
It's in
my DNA.
BELLA
Killing is in your DNA?
JACOB
Man, I thought maybe you wouldn't be
such a hypocrite -- what, I'm not the
right kind of monster for you? Can't
measure up to your bloodsucking
friends --
BELLA
(angry as well)
Hey, they manage to survive without
hurting innocent people.
Jacob stops -- a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion.
JACOB
Wait - innocent? -- so... you don't
care that I morph into a giant dog.
Just that I... kill people?
BELLA
(appalled)
"Just?" Those hikers' lives mean that
little to you?
He bursts out laughing.
BELLA
(repelled, turns to go)
Oh my God.
JACOB
Bella -- Bella wait...
(he stops her)
We're not killing hikers.
We're
trying to protect them.
BELLA
From what?
JACOB
The only thing we do kill: Vampires.
BELLA
(stunned, reels)
Vampires? Jake, no --
72.
JACOB
(steps back, bitter)
Don't worry, we can't touch your
precious Cullens - unless they bite
someone and violate the Treaty --
BELLA
That's not what I -- you can't fight
vampires. They're too dangerous.
JACOB
Please. We took out that leech with
the dreads easy enough.
BELLA
You... killed Laurent?
JACOB
(worried)
... He didn't seem like a friend.
BELLA
No, God no.
But... how?
JACOB
It's what we do, why we exist. A few
"lucky guys" in the tribe have the
gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town,
our DNA kicks in, we reach the right
age and the fever hits --
BELLA
(realizing)
"Mono."
JACOB
I wish. Next thing I know, they're
telling me, this is your life now. That
future you saw for yourself? Gone.
Desolation fills him.
She sees this.
BELLA
It's bad, huh?
JACOB
I just hate feeling... out of control.
Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't
be around me.
BELLA
Like you could get rid of me.
73.
JACOB
You've seen Emily.
That lands with her.
She nods.
JACOB
Sam lost it for a split second; Em was
standing too close -- he's still messed
up about it.
(beat)
I don't want to be that kind of
nightmare.
BELLA
You're not like that. You save
people, right? You saved me from
Laurent.
JACOB
Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His
red-headed girlfriend will be fun,
too.
Bella stops, chilled to the bone.
BELLA
Victoria.
She's here?
JACOB
We chased her all the way to the
border the other night. But she won't
stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we
knew what she was after...
(sees Bella's face)
... What?
BELLA
I know what she wants.
Me.
SMASH TO:
A MASERATI with Canadian plates blasts down the highway at a
blinding speed --
ON JARED --
JARED
Excellent. If the redhead's after
Bella, we've got bait.
With stunning speed, Jacob grabs a four-pronged spading fork
from some garden tools, and FLINGS it toward Jared's head -
Jared easily, and amazingly, catches it.
JACOB
She is not bait.
INCLUDE - A picnic table in the middle of this small,
quaintly landscaped garden. Jacob, Bella, Embry, Paul, Sam,
Jared and Emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast.
BELLA
I should leave town.
SAM
Victoria will follow you and make it
harder for us to catch her.
BELLA
No one can catch her.
She can escape
anything.
PAUL
Ooh.
She has special powers.
BELLA
Some of them do.
They all look at her.
She instantly regrets saying it.
JACOB
Like... what? Bella?
JARED
The mind reader you said you knew. He
was a suckhead? Can they all do that?
EMBRY
That would blow.
BELLA
No, I -- shouldn't have - no.
PAUL
She's still protecting them.
76.
JARED
I don't know why. It's not like they
stuck around to protect you --
JACOB
Guys, back off.
Jacob looks apologetically at Bella.
She shrinks, stung.
Jacob walks her to the door.
JACOB
Don't worry, we've got this place
covered. She won't get near you or
Charlie.
Bella nods.
He sees she's blue.
JACOB
Hey, we should do something fun.
Like... cliff diving, right?
BELLA
I could use the rush.
JACOB
Soon.
After we catch her.
He offers a reassuring look before jogging into the woods.
Bella tentatively approaches the large, modern glass home.
She climbs the porch steps, approaches the door...
-- Bella runs to the window, peers in at the family who
continue to ignore her as they gather around Edward --
Bella knocks on the door, rain falling around her, wind
blowing strong. Emily opens the door. Sees her.
EMILY
Bella.
Are you okay?
BELLA
Yeah, I just... is Jacob here?
He
wasn't at home...
Sam appears behind Emily.
SAM
He's with Jared and Embry, keeping an
eye on things. I'm heading out soon.
Should I tell him something?
-- as Sam wraps an arm around Emily. Their deep love is
achingly obvious. Off Bella's face --
FLASHPOP to Bella and Edward at her birthday party, in a
similar embrace, as Alice SNAPS their picture --
BACK ON BELLA - pained.
EMILY
You want to come in?
-- But Bella's already hurrying to her truck, determination
on her face.
CLOSE ON A RIFLE as it locks and loads. INCLUDE CHARLIE,
who checks it, then notes the position of the SIX MEN in his
hunting party, all wearing rain gear. He SEES Harry at the
end of the line, pausing, looking down.
CHARLIE
You got something, Harry?
78.
LIGHTNING FAST CUTS of THE CHASE - the wolves are right on
Victoria's tail, blasting through the forest --
BACK ON CHARLIE - SLOW MOTION - He turns to SEE Harry
clutching his chest. Charlie runs to Harry's side --
SMASH BACK TO VICTORIA escaping at breakneck speed she
bursts out of the trees to --
-- Victoria beelines for the choppy water, dives in -- when
she reappears, she's hundreds of yards offshore --
THE WOLVES prowl the beach in frustration as we go --
79.
BACK ON HARRY - SLOW MOTION - he falls to his knees just as
Charlie reaches him. Off Charlie beginning CPR...
SMASH TO:
Bella's truck comes to a stop; she climbs out. Ignoring the
wind and rain, she strides to the cliff's edge; looks down --
BELLA'S POV - THE WATER - steely gray.
Rough whitecaps.
EDWARD (O.S.)
Step back.
Bella smiles, tears of relief springing to her eyes.
She
turns to find Edward's apparition at her side.
She steps back from the cliff's edge - which causes him to
disappear.
That's it. She starts pulling off her shoes and coat,
adrenaline pumping --
Edward's apparition reappears, but she keeps going --
EDWARD
Stop this now, Bella.
BELLA
You won't stay with me any other way.
She takes a last look at him... then with a running leap --
FLINGS herself over the edge --
ON BELLA SCREAMING with exhilaration as she plummets down,
down... then SPLASHES into the water.
No sign of Bella. A beat. Suddenly, she POPS back up.
Inhales deeply -- and laughs!
BELLA
Yes!
She enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment... then turns
to swim ashore... but her smile falters when she realizes
how strong the current is...
A WAVE crashes over her head. She gasps for breath.
Then
ANOTHER WAVE hits her. Starts to pull her under...
80.
UNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles --
ABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES --
BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish,
bobbing on the surface of the water --
Bella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing
is suddenly thirty yards closer.
Bella struggles to stay afloat but the current SMASHES her
into a rock, the air goes out of her chest. She sinks.
ANGLE ON THE ORANGE-ISH THING -- IT'S VICTORIA, floating
effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face. She dips
below the surface, vanishing...
UNDER THE WATER - BELLA SINKS, struggling at first... Edward
appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love.
He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things
going dark... suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR --
SMASH TO:
CLOSE ON BELLA - barely conscious.
JACOB
Breathe, Bella! C'mon!
Jacob hits her on the back.
She spits up water, coming to.
JACOB
Bella?
Can you hear me?
BELLA
... Jake?
She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved.
Behind him stands Sam.
SAM
She'll be alright.
Sam looks out at the water, scanning it.
Sensing something.
JACOB
What the hell were you thinking?
BELLA
I needed... to see... something.
81.
JACOB
What? The pearly gates?
If we hadn't
heard you scream --
SAM
Get her home. I'm heading to the
hospital. I'll meet you there.
Jacob nods.
Sam jogs off.
JACOB
Why would you jump? Didn't you notice
it's like a hurricane out here?
BELLA
I know. It was stupid --
(realizing)
-- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt?
JACOB
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
BELLA
Oh my God - does my Dad know?
JACOB
He and my dad are both over there.
BELLA
Will Harry be okay?
JACOB
I don't know. Come on. I'll find you
something dry and drive you home.
As Jacob helps Bella up, we RACK FOCUS out to --
ANGLE ON THE WATER - where Victoria bobs, watching Jacob
guide Bella away... then she disappears below the surface.
The truck pulls up to the curb. It's pitch black outside.
Jacob's still holding her close as he shuts the engine off.
BELLA
So... this wolf thing's not all bad?
JACOB
It's better. Now that you know.
But...
BELLA
... but...
JACOB
It just... comes so easily to me.
More than the other guys.
BELLA
That's a good thing, isn't it?
83.
JACOB
Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less...
human than the others.
(beat, quieter)
Sometimes I'm scared I might...
disappear, you know? Who I really am.
Bella faces him, looks directly in his eyes.
BELLA
I won't let that happen.
Their faces are close... and stay close for an intimate
beat. They could kiss, their lips near... but Bella blinks
herself back to reality and pulls away.
BELLA
Thanks for driving - for everything.
-- as she pushes open her door. WIND wafts in -- Jacob
reacts to a repugnant smell outside --
JACOB
Holy crap -- !
He abruptly pulls Bella back into the truck, SLAMS her door
shut and starts the truck.
JACOB
There's a bloodsucker out there.
BELLA
How do you know?
JACOB
I can smell the stink.
I'm getting
you out of here.
As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --
BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY -- a black Mercedes is parked in
front. Bella spins to the rear window as Jacob floors it --
BELLA
Stop!
It's not Victoria --
JACOB
Forget it --
BELLA
It's Carlisle's car!
They're here.
Go back! --
84.
JACOB
It's a trick --
He's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while
they're moving - he SLAMS on the brakes. She jumps out --
JACOB
Damn it, Bella --
Bella hurries up the road toward her house. Jacob's
suddenly standing in front of her, furious --
JACOB
Stop.
You gotta come with me.
BELLA
It's okay.
They're my friends --
JACOB
Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back
here, this is their territory. The Treaty
says we can only defend our own lands.
BELLA
-- It's not a war --
JACOB
It is. And you'll only be safe in La
Push. I can't protect you here anymore.
BELLA
I don't need you to --
JACOB
-- You're about to cross a line --
BELLA
Only if you draw one.
She starts to move past him, but he stops her --
JACOB
I'm not letting you do this.
BELLA
You don't have a choice.
I don't
belong to you.
Her words are a knife to the heart. She sees that, but
can't take them back. He hands her the keys.
85.
JACOB
Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die.
She flinches at the stinging remark. He disappears into the
darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road.
She's closer to her house than her truck. She hurries
forward. The NIGHT SOUNDS start to encroach, branches
crackling, bushes rustling. She glances behind her...
nothing but darkness... she faces forward again ---
And runs directly into a VAMPIRE! Bella SCREAMS -- then
realizes IT'S ALICE. Bella is stunned. So is Alice.
BELLA
Alice!
ALICE
You're... alive.
She's clearly confused, but Bella hugs her with tears of joy.
BELLA
Oh my God, Alice.
You're here.
ALICE
I heard voices - I didn't think it was
you but - you're alive.
BELLA
You keep saying that.
ALICE
I saw you - a vision of you - you
jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too
late but --
(becoming angry)
Why the hell would you try to kill
yourself?!
BELLA
I didn't.
I was cliff diving.
ALICE
Why?!
BELLA
Um... fun?
ALICE
That was fun for you.
86.
BELLA
Until I hit the water.
ALICE
I have never met anyone more prone to
life-threatening idiocy... and what is
that hideous wet dog smell?
BELLA
Oh. Probably Jacob.
He's kind of a
werewolf.
Off Alice's horrified expression.
Carlisle and Esme walk away from the house, over the snow to
the treeline, on their way to hunt. None wear coats.
EDWARD
I'm hanging up now...
Rosalie turns away from the window.
ROSALIE
Wait!... You should come home.
(no response)
Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles.
Even Emmett's depressed. You've
really done a number on them.
EDWARD
(pained)
I'm sorry. I am. But they wouldn't
be happier with me around. Trust me.
ROSALIE
I... I just miss... us.
The family.
EDWARD
I know. But the further away I am,
the safer Bella will be. She deserves
a shot at a normal life --
88.
ROSALIE
But see, you don't have to worry about
that, not anymore --
She stops realizing she may be making a mistake.
But Edward
caught it, sits up.
EDWARD
Why, Rose?
Did something happen?
ROSALIE
I - uh --
EDWARD
Tell me, Rosalie.
(rises, fierce)
Tell me! --
ROSALIE
(blurts)
-- Alice had a vision. She saw Bella -
- throw herself off a cliff... She's
dead, Edward.
Edward reels, uncomprehending.
EDWARD
I... don't believe it.
ROSALIE
Alice is there now. Thought she could
help with the funeral or something.
STAY ON ROSALIE as --
ROSALIE
Come home, Edward. It's time...
Edward...?
She's been disconnected.
Off Rosalie, worried...
Bella walks Charlie to his cruiser. He wears a dark, ill-
fitting funeral suit. At the car, Bella adjusts his tie --
CHARLIE
Thanks for understanding, Bells. They
wanted to keep the service small.
BELLA
Don't worry about me.
Are you gonna
be okay?
89.
CHARLIE
Yeah... but Sue, and those kids --
Leah's only a year older than you.
And Seth's, what, fourteen...
Emotion threatens. She hugs him. He holds on a little too
tightly for a beat. Then he bucks up, climbs into his car.
CHARLIE
There'll be a reception after. I
might stay late, see if I can help.
Bella nods, then waves as he drives away. She turns to head
back inside but finds Alice suddenly at her side. She jumps.
ALICE
You're not going?
BELLA
I'm not the most popular person on the
werewolf rez right now.
ALICE
(saddened)
Because you're friends with me.
Bella shrugs. Alice hears something, then looks down the
road -- JACOB'S RABBIT appears in the distance....
ALICE
Huh. Didn't see them coming. Didn't
see him pull you out of the water -
maybe my visions are allergic to dogs.
BELLA
-- Alice.
ALICE
(jogging off)
I'll go do some hunting.
ANGLE ON THE RABBIT -- as it pulls up. Jacob drives, Embry in
the passenger seat. Bella approaches, surprised to find QUIL
in the back; same short hair and hard look as the others.
BELLA
Quil... you, too?
QUIL
(aggressive)
Yeah. Me, too.
Jacob climbs out.
Embry takes the driver's seat.
90.
JACOB
You alone?
BELLA
Yes.
Shouldn't you be at the funeral?
JACOB
Had to talk to you first.
(to the guys)
I'll meet you there. Go on.
They're wary... but pull out.
Jacob follows Bella into --
Alice flies to her car. But Jacob catches Bella's arm, not
hostile. Just pleading.
JACOB
Please, Bella. Stay here.
For
Charlie... for me.
Bella sees the love in his eyes; this could be last time she
ever sees him. She hugs him, then pulls away.
BELLA
Bye, Jacob.
He watches, agonized as she races to the car, climbs in...
Bella waits impatiently at the curb as --
A YELLOW HARD-TOP PORSCHE with darkly tinted windows
SCREECHES to a halt in front of her. The passenger door
opens - Alice is behind the wheel, pulling off the chic,
white, hooded coat she used for protection against the sun.
As Bella climbs in, buckles up --
BELLA
Where'd you get the car?
ALICE
Hope you're not opposed to grand theft
auto.
BELLA
Not today.
Alice FLOORS it and the Porsche PEELS OUT --
96.
AERIAL VIEW - THE YELLOW PORSCHE screams down a highway,
cutting lanes, weaving through Peugots and Fiats --
It's jumpy, uneven -- EDWARD stands in shadow, his shirt
open, eyes shut. A clock GONGS as he steps into SUNLIGHT --
ALICE
... He's going to make the Volturi
change their minds.
The narrow, centuries-old streets are crowded with festival
revellers who all wear RED. They gaily head toward the town
square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves. The
PORSCHE weaves through them, hurrying forward.
INTERCUT INSIDE THE PORSCHE --
BELLA
Why are they all wearing red?
97.
ALICE
San Marcos Day festival. The perfect
setting. Large crowds. The Volturi
won't let him get far enough to reveal
himself - he's counting on that.
BELLA
We only have five minutes --
Alice screeches to a halt at a ROAD BLOCK.
Italian POLICE
wave her back. Bella jumps out --
BELLA
Where's the square?
ALICE
Follow that lane --
-- Bella's already running --
ALICE
He'll be under the clock tower!
Alice watches her go... then senses something, looks up --
ALICE'S POV - ON THE ROOFTOPS - A FIGURE IN A BLACK HOODED
OVERCOAT leaps from building to building, tracking Bella.
As he disappears, off Alice --
Bella races down the cobble-stoned alleys, stumbling on the
uneven stones. Festival revellers head in the same
direction, she maneuvers around them.
ABOVE BELLA - SEE flashes of the FIGURE IN THE OVERCOAT --
As Bella nears the square, the alleys become more populated.
She pushes past people AD LIBBING "excuse me," "sorry."
Finally, she emerges into --
BELLA'S POV - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets.
On the other side of the crowded square - THE CLOCK TOWER;
it reads one minute before noon.
Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves
back, shouting at her in Italian --
ITALIAN MAN
Fare attenzione!
98.
Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by --
A FOUNTAIN - Suddenly, GONG!
The clock tower bells chime.
It's noon!
Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow
water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through
the crowd. Finally, she SEES --
BELLA'S POV - BENEATH THE CLOCK TOWER
Edward, in the shadows, just inches from the sunlight.
BELLA
Edward! --
-- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME.
She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --
CLOSE ON EDWARD (IN SLOW MOTION) - as he unbuttons his
shirt, exposing his bare chest --
ON BELLA (IN SLOW MOTION) - calling his name --
ON EDWARD'S FACE - he closes his eyes, welcoming death --
then slowly --
Edward takes a step into the sunlight, the rays hitting his
shoe, but before the sun touches his skin --
BELLA SLAMS into him - it's like running into a brick wall --
BELLA
No, Edward!
Don't!
Edward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms
its final CHIME. He's amazed, already dead in his mind.
EDWARD
Carlisle was right... heaven...
BELLA
No, I'm here. I'm alive.
EDWARD
(confused)
You're... not real.
BELLA
Look at me!
Alice was wrong.
He begins to realize... she is real.
99.
EDWARD
Bella?
BELLA
Please, step back.
I'm alive, I'm --
He suddenly kisses her, stepping back into the shade with
her. They soak each other in like starved people suddenly
nourished. He pulls away to look at her...
EDWARD
You're here.
BELLA
I'm here.
They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when
suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind
him, taking a protective stance in front of her --
They face the DARK ALLEY that runs under the clock tower.
Out of the alley's shadows emerge --
TWO FIGURES IN HOODED OVERCOATS. Both stunningly handsome
males in their 20's: FELIX, huge, strong; and DEMETRI,
slender, elegant. Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES.
EDWARD
I won't be needing your services after
all, gentlemen.
FELIX
Aro wants to speak with you again.
EDWARD
No rules were broken.
Demetri's smile suggests he doesn't agree. He's the more
gracious of the two. But no less dangerous.
DEMETRI
We should take this conversation to a
more appropriate venue.
EDWARD
Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and
enjoy the festival?
FELIX
The girl comes with us.
EDWARD
That's not going to happen --
100.
ALICE suddenly appears, lightly tripping through the alley
toward them, pulling back the hood of her white swing coat.
ALICE
Come on, guys, it's a festival.
She reaches Edward and Bella, positioning herself in a
protective stance, as well.
ALICE
We wouldn't want to make a scene.
FELIX
There won't be any scene.
And we'll
still win.
EDWARD
But not easily --
JANE (O.S.)
Enough.
A very tiny, young woman appears, JANE. She also wears a
dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out
from under the hood. SEE her CRIMSON IRISES.
Felix and Demetri are back off immediately. Edward and
Alice step back, as well. Bella can see they're afraid of
this small girl.
EDWARD
(nodding to her)
Jane.
BELLA
(sotto to Alice)
Who is she?
ALICE
(sotto to Bella)
Just do as she says.
Jane tosses Edward an overcoat.
He dons it.
JANE
Follow me.
Jane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll
follow. Felix, smirking, gestures for them to go ahead of
him. Edward takes Bella's hand...
101.
Jane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow,
dark alleys. Felix and Demetri bring up the rear. Edward
never loosens his grip on Bella's hand.
Their path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK. Jane just strides
forward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an OPEN
HOLE in the street; it's a drain. Alice follows Jane.
Bella looks down, sees nothing but BLACKNESS.
EDWARD
It's alright. Alice will catch you.
Edward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole --
Edward hunts a deer. Matching his pace is another vampire -
Bella! She's pale and beautiful - she and Edward smile at
each other as they take a last grand leap for the kill --
SMASH BACK TO:
106.
POV FROM AFAR ON A HILLTOP -- REVEAL IT'S VICTORIA watching
the house down below. Off her seething fury --
SMASH TO:
A FERRARI has pulled over to the side of the road. VICTORIA
PEERS IN THE WINDOW. The DRIVER, a middle-aged man smiles --
VICTORIA
Where you headed?
113.
DRIVER
Seattle.
VICTORIA
(a slow grin)
Sounds perfect.
As she climbs in...
