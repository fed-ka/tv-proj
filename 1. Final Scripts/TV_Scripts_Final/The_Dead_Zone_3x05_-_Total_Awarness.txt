  11EXT. CLEAVES MILLS - DAY

          Early on a dismal morning, one CAR traveling too fast for
          conditions.

                                        NEWS RADIO (V.O.)
                        --U.S. Senators continue to offer
                          tributes to Maine's Thomas
                          Marshall, who died yesterday after
                        collapsing while walking in
                          Georgetown--
                                (and under)


  22INSIDE THE CAR

          The driver is SYLVIA TESICH, the middle-aged, Tarot-reading
          psychic last seen in "The Hunt".  She is driving scared,
          distracted by her passenger and the news on the radio. 
          Her passenger is a young girl, 20-25, wearing a baseball
          cap, running pants, boots and black eye-liner.  Her
          tattooed arms encircle a BACKPACK as though it were a
          life preserver.  For the record, her name is GIBSON.  She
          TURNS OFF the radio.  Upset.  Gibson and Sylvia are in
          the middle of a heated conversation that will remain
          unknown to us --

                                        SYLVIA
                        They'll catch you.

                                        GIBSON
                        Just drive!

          Sylvia looks back over her shoulder.  Without warning,
          Gibson GRABS THE WHEEL--

                                        SYLVIA
                        NO!


  33EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

          A TRUCK is FLYING THROUGH -- no signs of stopping.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TEASER  - 1/9/04 - GREEN  2.


    3CONTINUED:3

          The car SWERVES to the left, BARELY MISSING THE TRUCK,
          before T-BONING a parked car.  The truck KEEPS GOING.


  44INSIDE THE CAR

          Gibson is shaken, but apparently unhurt.  She checks
          Sylvia, who is dead, then looks around worried.  Gibson
          TUGS Sylvia's purse away, kicks open the passenger side
          door, and GETS OUT.


  55EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY (RED-LIGHT CAMERA POV)

          Looking from on high -- FLASH POPPING frame by frame --
          watching Gibson RUNNING FROM THE SCENE.  Grainy,
          voyeuristic and threatening, this footage should suggest
          that SOMEONE IS WATCHING.  FLASH POP TO --


  66EXT. THE RED LIGHT CAMERA

          Ubiquitous.  All seeing.  You never did trust those
            things... FLASH POP TO --


  77INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY (SECURITY CAMERA POV)

          JOHNNY SMITH and BRUCE approaching.  STAY ON this low-
          grade video camera just a little too long... again, SOMEONE
          IS WATCHING.  Pan down to reveal Johnny and Bruce entering.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not obsessive.  I'm selective.

                                        BRUCE
                        So then select something.  This
                        is the third store we've been in
                        today. 


  88INT. STORE - TOY DEPARTMENT - DAY (SECURITY CAM)

          As Johnny and Bruce browse.  ANOTHER GRAINY POV.

                                        BRUCE
                        You know what I got for my ninth
                          birthday?  A bible.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And apparently you're still bitter
                        about it.          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TEASER  - 1/15/04 - BLUE-2  3.


99TOY DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - (LIVE ACTION)

          Johnny glides past the squirt guns, sports gear and movie
          tie-ins toward a set of Lego action figures (the kind you
          have to assemble).  He touches one --


  1010VISION - BIRTHDAY PARTY

          J.J. unwraps the container as Johnny -- present in the
          scene -- watches with expectation.  But as J.J. opens it,
          the lid FLIES OFF, SPEWING Lego pieces everywhere.


  1111RESUME JOHNNY

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's not gonna like this--

          Johnny moves on to the science toys, picking up a ROCK-
            POLISHING KIT--

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm officially a dad now.  I can't
                        just give J.J. a card and a twenty--


  1212VISION - ALTERNATE BIRTHDAY PARTY

          J.J. unwrapping the rock polishing kit -- again, Johnny
          is right at J.J.'s shoulder.  The other boys HOOT.  Another
          miss: Johnny might as well have gotten him socks.


  1313RESUME JOHNNY

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, nothing geological.  I'm
                        a... fun dad.

          He picks up a bow-and-arrow set, but now Bruce takes it.

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't need a vision to see
                        that's a bad idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need something... something
                          perfect.

          As his eyes, then Bruce's eyes, settle on--


            A SKATEBOARD

          Bruce picks it up.  A big smile.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TEASER  - 1/9/04 - GREEN  4.


    13CONTINUED:13

                                        BRUCE
                        Now we're talking, fun dad.

          He hands the board to Johnny, who happily accepts it.  We
          hear a DEAD ZONE WHOOSH!, which makes Johnny think, then
          turn back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Helmet.  Definitely need a helmet.

          He tucks a helmet under his arm.


  1414INT. STORE - CHECKOUT - DAY

            A middle-aged female CLERK puts the helmet in a bag with
          the skateboard as Johnny pulls his credit card out of his
          wallet.

                                        CLERK
                          Ninety-nine forty.

          The Clerk accepts the card, swipes it.

                                        BRUCE
                        J.J.'s gonna love it.  And your
                          driveway is a perfect track--

          BEEP.  The card isn't working.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Problem?

          The Clerk swipes the card a second time.  Another BEEP. 
          This time the Clerk reaches for her scissors.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you doing?

          She's CUTTING the card INTO PIECES.

                                        CLERK
                        Sorry, Mr. Smith, but your card
                        has been revoked--

          The Clerk DROPS the pieces into Johnny's outstretched
          hand.  As they land--


  1515THREE QUICK VISIONS - SURVEILLANCE CAM POVS

          A) Johnny buying gas...

          B) Johnny and Bruce paying at a restaurant...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TEASER  - 1/9/04 - GREEN  5.


    15CONTINUED:15

          C) Johnny on an internet shopping site typing his credit
          card number on his computer... 


  1616RESUME JOHNNY

          Staring at the credit card shreds in his hand.  Meanwhile,
          Bruce has pulled out his wallet.

                                        BRUCE
                        I got you covered.  How much was
                        that again?

                                        CLERK
                          Ninety-nine forty.  Cash or credit?

          Bruce starts to hand her his credit card, then thinks
          better of it.  Smiles.

                                        BRUCE
                        Cash.  Definitely cash.

            Disturbed by his visions, Johnny steps away and looks up
          at--


          A STORE SECURITY CAMERA

          Staring down at him, silent, LED glowing.  A few quick
          glances and Johnny SEES three more cameras.  Damn things
          are everywhere.  Bruce steps up, holding the new purchases.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's get out of here.


  1717INT. STORE - DAY (SECURITY CAMERA POV)

          Staring back at Johnny and Bruce, looking up at the camera. 
          As they exit, Gibson appears, dark eyes on Johnny, slipping
          out after him, hiding her face from the camera.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  1818INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Johnny is on the phone, agitated, as Bruce examines the
          badly-gift wrapped helmet and skateboard.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...but all my payments on that
                        credit card should be current.
                                (listens)
                        No, not personally.  They're made
                        through a trust--
                                (more listening)
                        That far behind?  Okay, thanks.

          He hangs up without saying good-bye.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, you've gotta get this money
                        thing straight with Purdy.  Aren't
                        you afraid he's ripping you off?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's complicated.  Don't worry,
                        I'm dealing with it.

          Bruce hands Johnny the skateboard package, shaking his
          head as Johnny's phone RINGS again.  Johnny sighs and
            answers--

                        Hello?

                                        FEMALE OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Good afternoon Mr. Smith.  This
                        is Bonnie with Wind-n-Sea Cruises
                        and I'm happy to inform you that
                        you have won an all-expense paid
                          cruise...

  1919INT. PARKED CAR - DAY

          Behind the wheel, Gibson, now revealed as "Bonnie, the
          Female Operator."  She's  parked up the street from
          Johnny's house.  As she continues her rap to Johnny, she
            SCRIBBLES NUMBERS on her left forearm, using a felt marker. 
          (She has PUSHED UP the sleeves of her sweatshirt to reveal
          that both forearms are covered with numbers.  These are
          not tattoos, but plain old ink.)

          We SEE THE NUMBERS as she gleans them off Johnny,
            superimposing her visions of rapidly flashing numerals
          across her face.

                                        GIBSON/BONNIE (PHONE)
                        Not interested?  Not even if I
                        told you this fabulous once-in-a-
                          lifetime romantic cruise is valued
                        at 2,399 dollars?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, I don't want to waste your
                        time.

                                        GIBSON/BONNIE (PHONE)
                        If you'll just take a minute to
                        hear what you've won, you won't
                        regret it... Are you sitting down?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, I'm hanging up.

          And he does.


  2020GIBSON - INT. CAR

          Talking to the dial tone.

                                        GIBSON
                          ...Thanks for your time...

          She finishes writing down the last of the numbers on her
          arm, pressing hard, like a compulsive.  Then she tosses
          the phone out the car window.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT ONE - 1/9/04 - GREEN  8.

          She TAKES A BREATH, as if the process of "reading" Johnny
          was physically difficult.

          The contents of Sylvia's purse are spread on the car seat
          next to her, notably a TAROT CARD, a FEATHERED DART, and
          half a dozen additional CELL PHONES.  Gibson tosses the
          tarot card, dart and other cell phones into her back pack,
          then dumps the purse and everything else in the back seat.

          She PULLS DOWN HER SLEEVES, looks out the front windshield,
          sees--


  2121EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY - FRONT GATE

          She sees Johnny and Bruce driving out the front gate. 
          She is about to approach, but Bruce's presence stops her. 
          As the Jeep drives off, all she can do is follow.


  2222EXT. LASER TAG - DAY

          A game center in a corner mall.  Over this shot we hear
          the ROAR of what seems like a platoon of Marines on leave--


  2323INT. LASER TAG - PARTY ROOM - DAY

          In fact, it's only half a dozen nine-year-old boys, though
          more are arriving with various parents.  Amid the general
          chaos we find SARAH, a BIRTHDAY CAKE in her arms, greeting
          one of J.J.'s friends (ZACK).

                                        SARAH
                        Hey, Zack, ready for some mortal
                        combat?
                                (then--)
                        J.J.!

          J.J. turns toward her from the scrum of boys.

                                        J.J.
                        What?

          She gives him a handful of coin-like tokens.

                                        J.J.
                          Awesome!  Thanks, mom.

                                        SARAH
                        Four tokens for every boy.  Laser
                        Tag starts in ten minutes--

          J.J. takes off on his mission.  Sarah notes a man (ADAMS)
          and woman (ROTH) standing nearby, looking lost.

                                        SARAH
                        Are you here for J.J. Bannerman?

                                        ADAMS
                                (smiles coolly)
                        No, we're here for the Leiberman
                        party.

          He and Roth move off.


          WALT

          Arrives, slightly out of breath.

                                        WALT
                        Did I miss anything?

                                        SARAH
                        Just the usual video mayhem.

          Walt YAWNS.

                                        SARAH
                        Late shift last night?

          A reminder: Walt and Sarah are still living apart.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, at the Laundromat.

                                        SARAH
                        Did you remember the camera?

                                        WALT
                        It's at the house, I thought you'd
                        bring it.

          A WAVE OF PURE NOISE washes over them.

                                        SARAH
                        Never mind, somebody will have a
                        camera.  Why don't you wrangle
                        the wild men while I put candles
                        on the cake--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey!

          They turn and see--

          JOHNNY

          A big wrapped PACKAGE under his arm, as he deftly slides
          through a sea of tweens, parents, and Laser Tag employees
          in their black T-shirts and headphones.  As Johnny reaches
          Walt and Sarah, he freezes, and looks directly up at--


          A SECURITY MONITOR

          Above the front desk, showing multiple views of the Laser
          Tag facility.  Including one of Johnny looking up at the
          monitor.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?

          Momentarily spooked, Johnny responds--

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  Where's the Birthday Boy?
                                (spotting his son)
                        Hey, J.J.!

          J.J. WAVES a quick hello, then dives back in with his
          buddies.  Sarah takes the present from Johnny.

                                        SARAH
                        Why don't I take that?  You two
                        better gear up--

                        Gear up?

          He sees Walt holding a pair of GAME VESTS.  FWAP!  A vest
          hits Johnny in the chest.

                                        WALT
                        Welcome to fatherhood.


  2424INT. LASER TAG - GAME ROOM - DAY (A SERIES OF SHOTS)

            A black-walled maze filled with smoke.  Human shapes,
          both child and adult, ZOOM back and forth, FIRING laser
          beams with enthusiasm and abandon.  We hear a cascade of
          ELECTRONIC PINGS as the hits ring up.

          Find Johnny, totally into it and moving fast despite the
          cane, snagging J.J. as he passes.

                        He's a killing machine!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh yeah?

          He MOVES OFF to shadow Walt -- the biggest killing machine
          in the maze.  Sure enough, Walt is BLAZING AWAY like a
          laser tag Rambo.  Johnny makes what looks like a suicidal
          move, STEPPING INTO Walt's field of fire.

                                        WALT
                        Eat laser beams, punk!

            A BARRAGE OF RED BOLTS hits Johnny.  Then he RUNS OFF,

                        Come on.

          Johnny leads J.J. into a narrow passage, then turns him
          around and aims him back the way they came.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait until I give you the signal.

          Then he takes up a position at the other end of the choke
          point.  A larger figure APPEARS between them.  Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now!

          J.J. rains RED BOLTS on Walt, who is being TAGGED by Johnny
          from the other side.  Walt WHIRLS and returns fire.

                                        WALT
                        That's it!  You're going down!

          Then he BLASTS them, and the chase is on again.  Walt
          rounds a corner, only to be ambushed by --


          BRUCE

          Guns blazing.  Bruce retreats, Walt in hot pursuit.

  2525THREE QUICK VISIONS - GIBSON

          In the car with Sylvia seconds before the crash... watching
          Johnny in the toy store... and talking on the cell phone

                        to hear-- 

          --She's also WRITING on her forearm.


  2626RESUME JOHNNY

          Disoriented by smoke and darkness as well as the vision. 
          He sees Gibson looking at him, red lasers slicing past
          her.  Something spooks her, and she suddenly turns,
            disappearing deeper into the maze.  Ignoring the continuing
          PINGS of lasers tagging him, Johnny SLIPS through the
          dark and smoke.  (The Man and Woman we saw earlier ARE
          HERE, IGNORING all the other players.)

          Johnny rounds a corner and finds her waiting for him.

                                        GIBSON
                                (insistently)
                        We need to talk!

          She REACHES INTO HER BACKPACK.  The gesture makes Johnny
            hesitate.  Does she have a gun?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do I know you?

          Before she can answer, TWO GREEN LASER BEAMS converge on
          her.  She moves, pulling Johnny into the path of the beams,
          triggering --


2727A VISION

          Flying back down the green beams to the "couple," Adams
          and Roth.  They are dressed for laser tag (or not?), but
          the weapons they hold are REAL PISTOLS.  With silencers.

          Adams and Roth both SHOOT Gibson, who FALLS DOWN DEAD.


  2828RESUME JOHNNY

          He pushes Gibson aside and TURNS TOWARD Adams and Roth. 
          But the crush of laser taggers is too great.  Realizing
          they've been spotted, the couple MELTS into the crowd and
          disappears into the darkness.

          Gibson takes advantage of Johnny's momentary distraction
          to PULL FREE, disappearing before ALARMS CLANG!  Lights

          The game is ruined.


  2929EXT. LASER TAG - BACK DOOR - DAY

          The emergency exit opens on an alley.  Johnny EMERGES,
          peeling off and tossing his vest back inside.  He looks
          for the girl, but she's gone.  He starts to look for her,
          but...


          AN SUV

          PULLS in front of him, cutting off his pursuit.

                        Watch it!

          He turns to see the driver of the SUV getting out.  This
          is COULTER, 30, stocky, muscular, earnest.  A true
            believer.

          Adams and Roth pass through different parts of the house,
          VISIBLE on Johnny's security system MONITOR.  Coulter
          OPENS his tablet and starts navigating his way through a

          ON THE SCREEN

          A ROW OF THUMBNAILS from various security camera feeds
          Coulter is monitoring, including Johnny's cameras.  In
          another window on the screen, Coulter has called up a

          A LOGO for ARGON SECURITY glows from the flat panel. 
            Something clicks in Johnny's mind, and he looks to...


          KITCHEN SECURITY MONITOR

          Down in the corner, something he never noticed before,
          the same ARGON logo.  Curious, he goes to his alarm control
          panel in the kitchen -- there's that logo again.

          Johnny returns to Coulter and the computer monitor, cocking

          Coulter knows he's losing Johnny.  Taps his way through

  4646EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          Johnny HURRIES UP to find Gibson inside her car, hunkered
          down so she can't be seen from far away. 

                                        GIBSON
                        I need your help.  They're trying
                        to kill me.

          Johnny isn't sure what to do.  Gibson opens the car door.

                        Please.

          Johnny thinks a beat, then realizes... of course he's
          getting in.  Gibson uses a screwdriver to start the car.

          back over his shoulder, wondering what the hell he's gotten

                        Just because there's no black
                        sedan behind us doesn't mean we're
                        not being followed.  We need to

                        I know a spot.  Take a right here.

          Gibson takes a right -- too hard, too fast.  Johnny's
          cell phone rings and he pulls it out.  Checks the ID --
          it's Walt.  Before he can answer, Gibson TAKES IT FROM
          HIM and THROWS IT OUT the window.

  5353EXT. LOVER'S LANE - NIGHT

          Find Gibson's car rolling to a stop near a beat-up old
          Van.  Inside the Van, THREE STONERS are LAUGHING and
          GETTING HIGH.  Gibson MEETS EYES with one of them,
          determines they're too out of it to care what she's doing.

                                        GIBSON
                        So this is where the locals party?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Same as when I was in high school. 
                        Trust me, there's no surveillance
                        up here.
                                (turns to her)
                        Okay, start at the beginning. 
                        What were you doing in the program?

                                        GIBSON
                        I have this thing for numbers. 
                        That's how I got into your house. 
                          I talked to you on the phone for
                          a minute and all your numbers
                        just flashed into my head -- see.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT TWO - 1/16/04 - PINK-2  27.*

          She shows him her arm full of numbers.  Johnny recognizes
          some of them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's my social security number.

                                        GIBSON
                        And your pin, and here's your
                        alarm code.  Oh, and your ebay
                          password.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Pretty impressive.

          She shrugs, tries to play it off as no big thing, but we
          can tell it's a burden she carries.

                                        GIBSON
                        You see visions, I see numbers. 
                        Everywhere I go, all the time. 
                        The only way I can get them out
                        of my head is to write them down.

          She rubs at her arm, as if it's scarred somehow.  Johnny
          feels for her.  He's finally met someone as tortured as
          he is.  She gives him a watery smile.

                                        GIBSON
                        Weird, huh?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not to me...  Why is Argon after
                        you?

          He smiles, urging her to continue with the story.

                                        GIBSON
                        A few months ago, Argon got the
                          contract to take over the remote
                        viewing program for the Defense

                        we're all assigned to a double
                        blind test against their new top
                        secret system -- Eyetrap.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's that?

                                        GIBSON
                        Some kind of monster intelligence
                          gathering program.  Like Napster

                        hooked up to.

                        That's exactly what Neal said.

                        and wrap everything up into a
                        giant digital burrito.

                        And what was it supposed to do?

                                        GIBSON
                        Catch bad guys.  Help law
                          enforcement communicate better. 
                        But then Neal got spooked, started
                          thinking the powers-that-be were
                        using his baby for something other
                        than its intended purpose.  He
                        asked a couple of the psychics to
                          remote-view our new boss at Argon --
                        guy named Scanlon.

                        Any idea what they saw?

                                        GIBSON
                        Nope.  But the next thing I knew,
                        two of the psychics were dead and
                        Neal was in the wind.  Before he
                          disappeared, he left this for
                        Sylvia.

          Gibson reaches into her backpack and pulls out the
            feathered dart and a note that reads Find Me.

                        Neal likes to play darts.  Even

                        them.  Guess he was hoping Sylvia

                        Okay.  What do you need me to do?

          darts by himself in a tiny ROADHOUSE, a stack of empty
          beer glasses littering his end of the bar.  At the other
          end of the bar, the BARTENDER (DOUG) and TWO REGULARS
          (FITCH and NICK) watch him, shaking their heads.

          Johnny, in the vision, watches the young man, totally
          absorbed in his game.  He takes note of the bartender and
          the regulars.

          Johnny surveys the bar, notices a bumper sticker on the
          cash register that reads, "WHERE THE HELL IS KEYHOLE, NEW
          HAMPSHIRE?"

          He hands the dart back to Gibson.

                          Anything?

                        That's him.  That's Neal.  He's
                        alright then?

          Johnny registers her relief.  Maybe Gibson has a crush?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can't say.  I saw him in a bar in
                          Keyhole, New Hampshire.  Doesn't
                        mean he's still there.

                                        GIBSON
                        Good enough.  Guess I'm heading
                        for New Hampshire.  You better
                        find a good hiding place.

                        Like hell, I'm going with you.

          Gibson shakes her head with a smile and puts the car in
          gear.  As they pass the Stoners on their way out, Gibson
          notices them getting out of their car, littering beer
          cans as they all head off into the woods to take a leak.

                        We only took her car 'cus she
                        took our car.  We were chasing
                        them when you landed.

  6262EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Here goes the auto parts truck.


  6363INT. BACK OF AUTO PARTS TRUCK - MOVING

          Johnny and Gibson huddled in the dark between all kinds
          of boxes, the load shifting occasionally.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So, Gibson... You strike me as
                          somewhat of a free spirit.  How'd
                        you wind up working for the
                          government?

                                        GIBSON
                        Pulled one hack too many and got
                        busted by the Feds.  Once they
                        found out what I could do, they
                        let me "volunteer" for national
                          security work instead of going to
                        prison.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (ironic)
                        Your parents must be very proud.

                        They're dead.  Plane crash.
                                (off his look)
                        It's okay.  I mean, it happened
                        when I was a baby.  Spent a couple
                        years in foster care...  No one
                        knew what to do with me.  The
                        numbers would start to come on
                        all fast and furious, and I
                          couldn't make it stop.  I used to
                        sit in a corner and bang my head
                        against the wall, trying to shut
                        it off.  My caseworker decided I
                        was autistic and put me in an
                          institution.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.

          Gibson shrugs it off, refusing to give in to self-pity.

                                        GIBSON
                        When I got tired of being drugged
                        all day and treated like a freak,
                        I ran away and never looked back. 
                        Been on my own since.
                                (looks off)
                        You know, the other psychics in
                        the program, they were the closest
                        thing I ever had to a real family. 
                        Neal too. 'Cus we were all just
                        freaks, you know?

                                        GIBSON
                        When I talk to you, I keep getting
                        these two dates flashing in my
                        head.  Real intense. 

          Johnny is a little nervous... he's never been on this
          side before.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are they?

          Gibson shows him her left arm, reading the dark bold
          numbers --

                        a big party?

          Johnny's thinking about Armageddon...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let's hope.


  6464EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

            Coulter's SUV rolls to a stop next to the Stoner's Van,
          abandoned.  Tablet under his arm, Coulter climbs out of
          his vehicle, heading for the car.  Adams and Roth are
          with him, scanning the lot, mundane yet threatening.

                                        COULTER
                        This is it, all right.

          He SETS the tablet on the hood of the car, then barks
          some orders into his cell phone and the HELICOPTER beam
          shuts off as the chopper PEELS AWAY.  As it does, Coulter's
          phone RINGS.  He knows who it is.

                                        COULTER
                          I thought we were supposed to
                        keep a low profile.  The choppers
                        are a bit much, don't you think?

          Coulter snaps his phone shut.


          TIGHT ON COULTER'S TABLET

            A "SEARCHING" indicator FLASHES for a few beats, then a
          Yahoo!- style map POPS UP, showing the area around the
          truck stop.  A few more CLICKS and we ZOOM IN on a MAP of
          the truck stop itself.  Several small EYEBALL ICONS BLINK,
          indicating nearby surveillance cameras.

          Coulter CLICKS on the nearest one and a window OPENS
          revealing--


6666A LIVE VIEW OF THE TRUCK STOP

          Coulter CAN SEE HIMSELF standing in the security view. 
          He LOOKS UP, spotting the camera.

          Beneath the window is a small graphic with arrows to STOP,
          REVERSE, PLAY, etc.  Coulter hits REVERSE.  Grins.

                                        COULTER
                        Please be kind.  Rewind.

          The view WHIZZES back -- people leaving and entering the
          lot, a guy having a smoke, a couple making out -- until
          TWO FIGURES APPEAR -- JUMPING BACKWARDS out of a truck:
          Johnny and Gibson.

                                        COULTER

  6767EXT. TRAIN CROSSING/ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION - NIGHT

          Find the auto parts truck STOPPED AT A CROSSING, the
          BLINKING wig-wags blocking its path.  Nearby is an
          ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION.

          There is NO TRAIN.


  6868INT. BACK OF TRUCK - NO LONGER MOVING

          Johnny and Gibson are getting impatient, as they wait in
          silence.

                        Why aren't we moving?

  6969EXT. TRAIN CROSSING/SUBSTATION - NIGHT

          Johnny peeks around the back of the truck, reacting to--


          JOHNNY'S POV

          No train, of course, but the wig-wags ARE STILL DOWN. 
          Only the auto parts truck waits.


          RESUME JOHNNY

          Gibson follows Johnny out of the truck.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's wrong--

          Gibson follows Johnny toward the only building nearby --
          the substation. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look!

          Johnny points toward the substation, where a SECURITY
          CAMERA sits above, pointed RIGHT AT THEM, a small red
          light GLOWING.

                                        GIBSON
                        We're so busted.

          Johnny takes the last few steps toward the building,
          TOUCHING a CABLE running down to the ground from the
          security camera, then up a pole to a small dish antenna.


7070A VISION - N.D.S.

          Starting tight on Johnny's face looking up at the camera--
          the view ramps back to the security camera POV, suddenly
          becoming grainy B&W of Johnny and Gibson still looking
          up.

          That B&W image compresses and is suddenly traveling down
          the cable -- then we're pulling back from the dish antenna --
          back in powers of ten -- until we bounce off a SATELLITE,
          then head back down to Earth, screaming down on Coulter's
          black SUV, our "signal view" crashing right through the
          hood -- until we see: The B&W security footage of Johnny
          and Gibson.

          THE VIEW RAMPS BACK AGAIN -- this time to reveal that the
          B&W image is ON COULTER'S TABLET -- next to another window

          THE VIEW WIDENS AGAIN -- this time to reveal VISION JOHNNY
          sitting in the back seat of Coulter's car, looking over
            Coulter's shoulder as he rides shotgun.  We are in a Johnny-
              watching-Coulter-watching-Johnny loop.  Coulter shivers. 
          The DRIVER throws him a look.

                        That was weird.  For a second
                        there it almost felt like he could
                        see us.

          Hearing Coulter IN HIS VISION, real Johnny can't help
          himself, WAVING GOODBYE.

          On the monitor, WE SEE Gibson pick up a rock and she SLAMS
          it into the camera lense.  The image TURNS TO SNOW on
          impact. 

          Still part of Johnny's vision: COULTER REACTS.

          FADE IN:

  7171EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Johnny and Gibson hoof it down the empty highway.  They'd
          hitchhike, but there are no cars.

                                        GIBSON

                        Not your fault.  Fate has had it
                        in for me for a while.

                        Here comes somebody.  Looks like
                        a tow truck.

          Johnny and Gibson jab a thumb out as the tow truck passes.


  7272THE TOW TRUCK - SEEN FROM BEHIND

          It grinds to a halt as Johnny and Gibson run after it.

                        Let me do the talking.  I've got
                        other skills besides number
                        crunching.

          She UNZIPS her sweatshirt and adjusts her tank top to
          expose some cleavage.  Johnny gives her a look.

          But Gibson's reaction tells us something is very wrong.

          REVERSE TO REVEAL

          The tow truck driver is a WOMAN.  Suddenly self-conscious,
          Gibson turns to Johnny, who is just catching up.  He reacts
          to the Woman Driver, and off Gibson's look, decides to
          try Plan B, turning on the old J. Smith charm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Uh, good evening, miss...

          He notes the signage on the truck -- "Betty's Towing".

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...you must be Betty.

                                        BETTY
                        That's me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nice truck, Betty.

          Betty is not what you'd call easy on the eyes. 
            Nevertheless, she's charmed by Johnny.

                                        BETTY
                        You need a ride?

          As Johnny and Gibson climb in, Johnny throws Gibson a

  8888INT. CABIN - NIGHT

          A large living room and kitchen area lit by LANTERN. 
          Johnny and Gibson sit around a table.  Pynchon stands,
          his rifle within reach.  He is tense.

                                        PYNCHON
                        What happened to Sylvia?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Argon gimmicked the streetlights. 
                        Their car crashed.

                                        PYNCHON
                        I gave Argon a link to the Quick
                        Switch system.
                                (bitterly)
                        This is all my fault.  I asked
                        the psychics to remote view
                          Scanlon.

                                        GIBSON
                        How were you supposed to know
                        this would happen?

                                        PYNCHON
                        I knew Scanlon was up to something. 
                          I should have calculated the risks
                        more carefully.
                                (to Gibson)
                        At least you got out alive.  My
                        advice is to keep running.  That's
                        what I intend to do.  Tonight.

          Pynchon starts throwing things into a small bag.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can't just leave.  Scanlon
                        has to be stopped.

                                        PYNCHON
                        You stop him.  I don't have the
                        heart to fight another losing
                        battle.

          JOHNNY

          looks at Gibson for a little help.  She indicates with
          her eyes a picture on the wall: Pynchon and a woman. 
          Happier times.  Gibson knows the story.  Knows now is the
          time for Neal to tell it to Johnny.

          Johnny takes the photo of the girl off the wall.  Pynchon
          notices.

                                        PYNCHON
                        Put that down.

          Pynchon grabs for the picture in Johnny's hands, brushing
          against Johnny and triggering --


  8989VISION

          A security camera POV from an ATM.  The young woman from
          the photograph is making a withdrawal.  Behind her stands
          a MAN dressed in black, dark glasses and a baseball cap
            obscuring his face.  As the woman finishes her withdrawal,
          the man robs her, taking her money, then shoots her point
          blank.  As she falls to the ground, the man casually walks
          away.  As the sequence ends, it suddenly snaps back to
          the beginning and repeats.

          The vision widens to reveal Johnny, watching this on a
          computer monitor -- the view widens further to reveal
          Johnny is in Pynchon's office.  Pynchon is at his desk,
          watching the sequence repeat over and over, a bottle of
          Scotch in front of him.

                        She was murdered. 

          Pynchon pulls away from Johnny.  Disturbed.

                                        PYNCHON
                        How did you --
                                (thinking)
                        Oh, right.  Your abilities.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You loved her.  I can see that
                        just by looking at your face.

          Pynchon nods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But you couldn't save her.  So
                        now you're just giving up?  You're
                        not even willing to try?

                                        PYNCHON
                        You don't understand.  I did try. 
                          I created Eyetrap because of her. 
                        I did it for Amy.

                        She didn't fight, she didn't
                          scream...  She gave him the money
                        but the bastard shot her anyway.

          Gibson touches his arm.  He lets her, then shies away,
            unwilling to be comforted.  Picks up a dart from the table.

                                        PYNCHON
                        I was working on face recognition
                          software for the Defense Department
                        at the time.  I thought if I could
                        link that up with information
                          gathering technology the NSA was
                          testing, I'd have the kind of
                        total information awareness that
                        could find the creep who shot
                        her.  My program became the basis
                        for Eyetrap.

          He FIRES the dart at the photo--


          CLOSE ON THE PHOTO - THE MUGGER

          A shadowed face DOMINATED BY SUNGLASSES AND A HAT.

                                        PYNCHON (O.C.)
                        It took Eyetrap less than a day
                        to match this guy to three other
                        crimes.  The same M.O.  Eight
                          different cameras.  Two other
                        victims shot.


          WIDER VIEW

          as Johnny and Gibson listen, moved by his story.

                                        PYNCHON
                        But I could never identify him. 
                          A billion dollars worth of image
                          recognition software, beaten by
                        some low-life in a baseball cap
                        and a pair of drugstore sunglasses. 

          He reaches for the bottle of Scotch, but Gibson, almost
          without thinking, takes it away before he can touch it. 
          He looks at her, pissed at first, but then something about
          the way she is looking at him, the empathy and sadness in
          her eyes, makes him acquiesce.

                                        PYNCHON
                        But it was perfect for spying on
                        your friends and neighbors.

                        Great for amassing information on
                          political rivals.  The crooks
                        know how to beat the system, but
                        your average joe doesn't have a
                        clue.  And Scanlon knows it.  I
                        thought I was part of something
                        good, something that would protect
                        lives.  But instead, Scanlon and
                        the others are using it to ruin
                        lives.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So you're just gonna let them
                        win?  Light out for the woods and
                        crawl into a bottle -- that's
                        your plan?

                                        PYNCHON
                        You got a better one?  Scanlon is 
                          invulnerable.  He has friends in
                        high places, and whatever enemies
                        he has can't touch him.  He knows
                        too much.  He knows everything.
                              (a bitter smile)
                        Thanks to me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's right.
                                (off Pynchon's look)
                        I know how you feel.  Your friends
                        are dead and it all seems
                          impossible, so you want to run. 
                        But there's still someone here
                        who needs your protection.

          Pynchon looks over at Gibson, seeming very vulnerable
          right now beneath her tough girl exterior.

                                        PYNCHON
                        What do you want me to do?

                                        GIBSON
                        We can't give up.  If they win,
                        it won't matter if we get away.

            A moment, as Pynchon weighs his option.  Then Johnny sees--


          A GREEN TARGETING DOT

          Moving quickly along the cabin wall until it FINDS HIM,
            centering on his chest and triggering--          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT FOUR - 1/9/04 - GREEN  52.

          Johnny turns off the lantern, plunging the cabin into
            darkness.  WHOOSH!  We follow the beam THROUGH THE WINDOW
          and into the night beyond, where Adams, wearing night
          vision goggles, AIMS a weapon at Johnny, and FIRES--


          RAMP BACK INTO CABIN - NIGHT VISION

          One after another, Johnny is HIT, followed by Gibson,
          then Pynchon.  They fall to the floor--

          Back before he turned down the lantern, realizing this
          was a deadly vision.  And seeing that GREEN TARGETING DOT
          moving up his chest toward his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Down!

          Johnny hesitates for a second, thinking about the vision
          and how to change the outcome.  He spots a high powered
          flashlight on the counter and grabs it, then turns off
          the lantern.

          Pynchon GRABS Gibson and DRAGS her out of the line of
          fire, SHELTERING HER behind a couch.

          Coulter is suddenly inside.  Wearing NIGHT VISION GOGGLES,
          he SWEEPS the interior with the green targeting beam of
          his weapon.

          he TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON, blinding Coulter's night
          vision.  The whole view WHITES OUT.  Johnny's image
          DISAPPEARS as--

          From outside the cabin, comes a muffled THUMP! THUMP!

          A beat.  Johnny goes to--


          THE CABIN DOOR

          Johnny swings it open, to find Adams and Roth on the
          ground.  Doug, Fitch and Nick stand over them, knee in
          their back, and hunting rifles in hand.

          Johnny goes up to Coulter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What was it?  What did the psychics
                        see that was worth killing them

          Johnny touches Coulter's arm, triggering --

          Coulter, wearing a hat and sunglasses, and carrying an
            umbrella, crosses a busy street.  He bumps into a
            distinguished OLDER GENTLEMAN, but keeps going.  The older
            gentleman takes two more steps and collapses.  Coulter
          looks back, sees this but keeps going.  The vision ends.          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT FOUR - 1/15/04 - BLUE-2  53A.

                          Marshall.

                        Scanlon is so paranoid he records
                          everything.  Guy makes Richard

                        We'll just slip in the back way,

          Pynchon is still shy, but this time he doesn't glance
          away.  Johnny "Ahems" them back to the task at hand.

                                        PYNCHON
                        Right, let's find this footage....

          He goes to work.  After a moment --

                                        PYNCHON
                        Bingo.

          Off the three of them, pleased with themselves --          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT FOUR - 1/15/04 - BLUE-2  57.

  100100B&W SECURITY FOOTAGE - A STREET - DAY - SURVEILLANCE CAM
          POV

          A street in Georgetown, some traffic and a few pedestrians,
            including SENATOR THEODORE MARSHALL -- and SCANLON.  We
          are seeing them from A TRAFFIC SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, UP
          HIGH, panning as it finds the pair, then GOES CLOSER.  We
          hear them on a directional microphone that loses a bit of
          presence every time a head is turned.

                                        SENATOR MARSHALL
                        I know all about the budget
                          authorization, and I can count
                        heads: you're one vote short.

                                        SCANLON
                        Which is why I'm here now, Senator.

                                        SENATOR MARSHALL
                        What is it you've got?  Tax
                          records?  My drug prescriptions? 
                        Maybe your extortion tactics worked
                        on the others, but there's nothing 
                        about me that hasn't come out at
                        some point in six campaigns.

                                        SCANLON
                        We don't need to talk like this. 
                        Not here.

                                        SENATOR MARSHALL
                        We don't need to talk at all, do
                        we?  I should just assume that
                        you know everything.  Thanks to
                          Eyetrap.
                                (jabs a finger in
                                  Scanlon's chest)
                        Do your worst, Scanlon.  I'm voting
                        no.

          Scanlon regards the Senator with a mixture of pity and
            contempt.

                                        SCANLON
                        I'm disappointed, Senator.  Very
                          disappointed.

          He and Senator Marshall start across the street.  But
          Scanlon STOPS.  As Marshall continues across the street,
          A MAN with an umbrella, crossing in the opposite direction,
          bumps into the Senator.  The Senator takes two more steps
          then collapses.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT FOUR - 1/15/04 - BLUE-2  58.


    100CONTINUED:100

          A beat.  As Pedestrians RUSH toward the Senator, Scanlon 
          turns and walks away.  Then the man who bumped into the
          Senator looks back over his shoulder at the Senator --
          it's Coulter.  He drops the umbrella into a trash can and
          walks off.


          THE VIEW PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:


  101101INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Johnny, a pile of letters in his hands (he's just come in
          from the mailbox), watching this on his big screen TV. 
          The surveillance footage cuts to a news report.

                                        REPORTER
                                (on screen)
                        ...this shocking video shows the
                          director of Argon with Maine
                        Senator Theodore Marshall just
                        moments before he was apparently
                          poisoned by a second man, Rob
                          Coulter, an employee of the
                          company.  Company spokesmen deny
                        any knowledge of the activities
                        of those involved.  Virginia police
                        have arrested Scanlon and the
                        Senate Intelligence Committee is
                        scheduling hearings on the
                          appropriation for the Eyetrap
                        system.
                                (beat)
                        As the scandal widens, the FBI
                        also continues to search in vain
                        for the hackers who broke into
                        one of the most secure computer
                        systems in the world, spamming
                        news organizations around the
                        globe with this very sensitive
                        footage...

          Johnny, on the phone with Sarah, smiles at his handiwork
          as he simultaneously opens his mail.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, I'm just glad everything
                        went well.

                                        SARAH (PHONE)
                        The kids had a great time, but
                        J.J. missed you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I'm making it up to him.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TOTAL AWARENESS - ACT FOUR - 1/9/04 - GREEN  59.


    101CONTINUED:101

                                        SARAH (PHONE)
                        How?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (with a grin)
                        Sorry, that's classified.  I'll
                        talk to you later.

          They hang up as Johnny opens an envelope and finds new
          credit card.  He looks at it with not a little suspicion. 
          Tosses it on the table.

          Then he finds a postcard... one side shows the Live Free
          or Die Beer Bar & Bait Shop, the other side is BLANK except
          for Johnny's name and address.  Touching it triggers--


  101A101AA JOHNNY VISION

          Pynchon and Gibson, together on a sunny, deserted beach. 
          Gibson's bare arms now free of numbers.  They seem very
          happy--


    101B101BRESUME JOHNNY

          Smiling.  Then suddenly his smile turns to a look of fright
          and he dives out of the way as...


          J.J. BANNERMAN

          slices past the couch on his new skateboard, helmet on,
          crashing into Johnny, both of them laughing.  Johnny helps
          him up and J.J. skates off, cutting around a corner.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I'm letting you skateboard
                        in the house, but watch the
                          moulding!

          A CRASH from O.S.

                                        J.J.
                        Sorry!

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's okay!
                                (to himself)
                        Yeah, I'm a fun dad...

          Johnny heads for his son, passing a table piled high with
          ripped out security equipment.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                END ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
