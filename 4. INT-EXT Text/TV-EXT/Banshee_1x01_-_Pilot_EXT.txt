      An outer gate slowly opens to reveal...

      LUCAS HOOD (40) -- lean, rugged, dangerous-looking -- 
      standing in a holding area, just being released.  He wears a 
      denim shirt and jeans.  He steps past the gate, watches it 
      close behind him, and only then turns to face the world.


      VARIOUS SHOTS OF LUCAS:

      Walking along the highway/ On a city bus, looking out the 
      window/ In a mostly empty bar, drinking a beer.  He makes eye 
      contact with the SEXY BARTENDER.  She flashes a flirty look. 



      Lucas expertly hot-wires an S.U.V. and then we cut to... 



      Lucas drives the S.U.V. - PULL BACK to see he s driving ON 
      THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE toward the Manhattan Skyline.



      A large, trendy, Greenwich Village hair salon.  Lucas crosses 
      the street and steps inside.



      Lucas pulls out of his parking spot.  A few car lengths 
      behind him, a DARK LEXUS SEDAN pulls out to follow.  There 
      are three bad-ass looking MEN in dark suits in the car.  The 
      driver has a chiseled face and a sharp widow s peak.



      Lucas, driving down BROADWAY, checks his mirror.  CLOSE ON 
      the mirror, which shows the Lexus a few cars back.  Lucas 
      floors it, weaving through rush hour traffic.  The Lexus 
      follows and pulls right behind Lucas.  

      Suddenly, Lucas yanks the wheel, braking the SUV sideways. 

                                  MEN IN THE LEXUS
                    WATCH OUT!/ FUCK!

      The SUV slams to a stop perpendicular to traffic.  THE LEXUS 
      CRASHES INTO the SUV s front passenger door.  Other cars 
      swerve and crash into both vehicles.

      Lucas tries to get out, but his door is pinned by another 
      car.  He climbs out the shattered passenger window, runs up 
      and over the Lexus, and takes off running up the middle of 
      Broadway as speeding cars honk and swerve around him.

      GUNSHOTS ring out and bullets shatter the windshields of 
      approaching cars.  Lucas looks back to see WIDOW S PEAK and 
      the other two GOONS chasing him and shooting at him.

      When Lucas looks forward, he sees a DOUBLE-DECKER TOUR BUS 
      hurtling toward him.  The bus driver swerves desperately, 
      jackknifing the bus.                                                                                        4.


      At the last second, Lucas jumps clear of the swinging edge of 
      the bus, which then hits one of the pursuing goons, who grabs 
      hold of a rail and rides it for a moment.  THE BUS JUMPS THE 
      CURB AND SLAMS INTO A BUILDING, CRUSHING THE GOON TO DEATH.

      Lucas looks back to see Widow s Peak charging relentlessly 
      through the melee, shooting.  Looking ahead, Lucas sees a MAN 
      ON A MOTORCYCLE idling at a cross street.  The guy wears a 
      slick suit and looks very Wall Street.  

      Lucas takes a running jump and lands on the bike, straddling 
      the seat, basically in the guy s lap.

                                  LUCAS
                    Get off.

                                  GUY ON MOTORCYCLE
                    Fuck you!

      Lucas shrugs, grabs the handles and accelerates the bike 
      across Broadway through the oncoming traffic.  The Wall 
      Street guy holds on to Lucas and yells indignantly.

      As they tear away down the cross street, Widow s Peak stops 
      and takes aim.

      ON LUCAS, as the guy holding him keeps yelling.  We hear a 
      shot, and A BULLET BURSTS THROUGH WALL STREET GUY S HEAD, 
      TAKING HALF HIS FACE WITH IT.

      Lucas looks back as the dead man falls off the bike. Another 
      shot rings out.  Lucas guns the engine and gets the fuck out 
      of Dodge. 

      ON WIDOW S PEAK and his remaining partner as they watch Lucas 
      speed away.  As approaching SIRENS wail, PULL UP AND HIGH to 
      see the carnage strewn up and down Broadway.



      Idyllic Pennsylvania countryside, large stretches of 
      farmland.  Cows in pastures.  Amish farmers work the land.

      Lucas, in a stolen BLACK CAMARO, drives on a two-lane road, 
      passing this farmland.  He passes a sign: WELCOME TO BANSHEE, 
      POP. 11,400.  He drives into town, cruises down Main Street.

      Lucas s POV: young mothers push strollers, skateboard punks 
      jump sidewalk benches.  Three fresh-faced young Special 
      Forces soldiers in tan camo uniforms walk down the street, 
      eating ice cream cones.                                                                                      5.


      Two teenage Amish girls in traditional garb walk by a 
      lingerie shop called Bedroom Eyes: one lingers to look at a 
      window display of a topless female mannequin in a black 
      leather thong.  The other girl pulls her friend along.  

      On Lucas stopping and idling at the red light in the center 
      of town.  To his right is the TOWN HALL.  As he drives out of 
      the frame, we STAY ON Town Hall.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Gordon walks downs the steps where he sees:

      CARRIE HOPEWELL (38), striking and sexier than a small town 
      wife has any right to be.  She gives him a kiss.

                                  CARRIE
                    You ll get him next time, 
                      counselor.

      They head down the steps together.

                                  GORDON
                    I m ready for this day to be over.
                          (off her loaded look)
                    What?  No.  Again?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The minivan pulls past a mailbox that says HOPEWELL, and into 
      the driveway of a mid-sized white colonial.  Max and Deva run 
      into the house ahead of their parents. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Dr. Welling referred Max to a new 
                      pulmunologist.  We have an 
                      appointment next week.

                                  GORDON
                    Great.

      Carrie looks at Gordon, who seems tense and distracted.

                                  CARRIE
                    You want me to cancel on the 
                    Frears?                                                                                      8.


                                  GORDON
                    Crap, that s tonight?

                                  CARRIE
                    I ll tell Joss we can t make it. 

                                  GORDON
                    No, I ll just take a shower, chew 
                    some aspirin.  I ll be fine.



      Carrie steps out the back door and looks around the empty 
      yard, shaken.                                                                                        9.



      Deva comes out the front door.  Her friend BEATY (15), also 
      in dark clothes, is waiting for her on the porch. 

                                  DEVA
                    You re late, bitch.

                                  BEATY
                    Whatever, skank.

      The two girls come down the porch steps.


      ON LUCAS IN HIS CAMARO

      He drives slowly past the house, staring with fascination at 
      Deva, turning in his seat to watch her as he passes.

      Deva looks up, sensing his eyes on her, but by the time she 
      registers the Camaro, Lucas has sped up and is out of view.



      The deck is on stilts ten feet above the back lawn, with a 
      steep side staircase down to the yard.  Carrie comes out onto 
      the deck, puts her bottles in a recycling bin.  She steps to 
      the railing, looks out into the yard, perturbed.      

                                  LARRY (O.C.)
                    What are you doing out here alone?

      Carrie turns: Larry Frears has stepped out onto the deck.

                                  CARRIE
                    I just needed some fresh air.   

      He closes the door behind him, joins Carrie.  He drinks from 
      a whiskey flask, offers her a sip.  She demurs.  He looks her 
      up and down: she s wearing a tight, low cut dress.  Larry 
      drunkenly ogles her breasts.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    I m up here, Larry.

                                  LARRY
                    I know.

      He leans forward and tries to plant a kiss on her mouth.  
      Carrie makes a surprised sound as she steps away from him.

                                  CARRIE
                    What the fuck?    

      Larry holds his hands up.

                                  LARRY
                    I m sorry.  I m a little smashed.

                                  CARRIE
                    Don t worry about it. 

      He looks out drunkenly at his lawn, points to one part of it.

                                  LARRY
                    I need to treat for grubs over 
                    there.

      He suddenly turns on Carrie again, this time grabbing her 
      breast as he kisses her.  In one fluid, explosive motion...                                                                                     18.


      CARRIE BRINGS HER ELBOW DOWN onto his arm, straight-punches 
      his throat, SPINS AND KICKS HIM THROUGH THE RAIL OF THE DECK.

      Larry falls out of view.  We hear a thud and a scream.

      Carrie gasps, shocked at her overreaction.  She looks over 
      the edge of the deck.  Larry is on his back on the lawn.  
      Twisted under him, his arm is horribly broken.

                                  CARRIE
                    Shit!

      She runs down the stairs to him, and kneels over him.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Larry, I m so sorry!

                                  LARRY
                    You bitch!  Stay away from me!

      Jocelyn, Gordon, and the other guests run out onto the deck, 
      and then down the stairs to Larry s side.

                                    JOCELYN
                    Oh my God, what happened?!

                                  CARRIE
                    I don t know.  The railing just 
                    gave way.

                                  LARRY
                    MOTHER OF SHIT, THIS HURTS!!  Call 
                    an ambulance, Joss! 

      Jocelyn whips out a cell and starts dialing.  Gordon fixes 
      Carrie with an inquisitive look.  She can t meet his gaze.



      Moonlight, a breeze, some leaves blowing over the lawn.  Now 
      wearing a sweatshirt, Carrie walks across the grass to the 
      woodshed and steps behind it... 

      ...to find Lucas sitting pensively on a low tree stump.  He 
      is holding a framed picture in his hands, studying it.                                                                                    19.


                                  LUCAS
                    Hi, Sam.

      Carrie stares, at a loss.  Every tension in the universe is 
      sparking between them.

                                  CARRIE
                    How did you find me?
                          (off Lucas s look)
                    Spineless tranny. 

                                  LUCAS
                          (nods toward her home)
                    It s a nice house.  It seems...I 
                    don t know, solid.  So what do you 
                    have, two kids?
                          (off her nod)
                    How old?

      We now see he s studying a framed photo of Carrie, Gordon, 
      Deva, and Max.

                                  CARRIE
                    My son s eight.  My daughter s 
                    thirteen.

                                  LUCAS
                    Huh.  She looks older.
                          (beat)
                    I can smell your perfume from here.

      Carrie pulls a gun out from behind her back and points it.

                                  CARRIE
                          (the hint of tears)
                    You need to leave.  Please.

      Lucas watches her, his expression now dead serious.

                                  LUCAS
                    Sam.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m not her anymore.  I m Carrie.

                                  LUCAS
                    Okay.

                                  CARRIE
                          (angry)
                    You could have led Rabbit straight 
                    to me!                                                                                    20.


                                  LUCAS
                    You know me better than that.

                                  CARRIE
                    I don t know you at all anymore.

      Lucas seems pained by that.  He gets up, walks over to her, 
      and presses the barrel to his chin.

                                  LUCAS
                          (sincere)
                    Then just shoot me.  I m a 
                    convicted felon on your property.  
                    You re golden.

      Carrie appears to seriously consider it.  He stares into her 
      eyes, accepting, as she pulls fractionally on the trigger.  
      Then she lowers the gun, stifles a sob.  Lucas considers her 
      gravely, then nods.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    You moved on.  I get it.  Just give 
                    me what I came for and you won t 
                    see me again.

                                  CARRIE
                          (dismayed)
                    I don t have the diamonds.

                                  LUCAS
                    What do you mean you- 

                                  CARRIE
                    -I don t have them! 
                          (off his incredulous 
                            stare)
                    After we screwed Rabbit like that, 
                      I couldn t clear them with anyone 
                    local, and you d gotten caught- 

                                  LUCAS
                    I did not get caught!

                      CARRIELUCAS
      Shit!  I know.  Listen- There were two of us in that 
                                                    building. I led them away 
                                                  from you! 

      Beat.

                                  CARRIE
                    The fence I found, these real 
                      bottom-feeders - Serbians -  they 
                    saw me coming.                                                                                    21.


                                  LUCAS
                    You re telling me that YOU got 
                    rolled?

                                  CARRIE
                    Rolled hard.
                          (gestures around her)
                    Does it look like I m sitting on 
                    ten million dollars?!

      Lucas sits back down on the tree stump, defeated.

                                  LUCAS
                    I don t get the girl.  I don t get 
                    the money.  I spent fifteen years 
                    picturing this day, and this isn t 
                    how I saw it playing out.

      Carrie watches him, devastated.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m so sorry.

      SOUND from off camera.

                                  GORDON (O.C.)
                    Babe?  You out here?

                                  CARRIE
                          (alarmed)
                    Shit!  That s Gordon!

      She peeks around the building, sees Gordon standing at the 
      back door.  She spins back around.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Please!  You have to go -

      But Lucas is already gone.  Resting on the tree stump is the 
      picture frame he was holding.  But the photo itself is gone. 



      We see shuttered windows and on the door a handwritten sign 
      that reads  CLOSED - GAS LEAK.   We track around the building 
      to see Sugar loading a corpse, wrapped in a checkered table 
      cloth, into the back of an old pick-up.  The corpse falls 
      into the truck bed, on top of two other wrapped corpses.

      Sugar climbs into the driver s seat and only then notices 
      Lucas sitting in the passenger seat.                                                                                    22.


                                  SUGAR
                          (startled)
                    Christ!  You trying to kill me? 

                                  LUCAS
                    Sorry.  You got a place picked out?

      Sugar gives him a hard gaze.  Lucas meets it.  Sugar shakes 
      his head and starts the truck.  They drive into the night.

                                  SUGAR
                    You re one of those complicated 
                    types, is that it?

                                  LUCAS
                    Nah.  People just don t always know 
                    simple when they see it.



      In a dark ravine, Lucas, shirtless, stands waist-deep in a 
      hole, digging.  Two bodies wrapped in tablecloths lie nearby.  
      Sugar emerges through the trees, carrying the third wrapped 
      body.  He lays it down gently.

                                  SUGAR
                    It doesn t seem right burying the 
                    sheriff here with that pond scum.

                                  LUCAS
                    We ll dig him his own hole.

                                  SUGAR
                    Yeah... that d be the Christian 
                    thing to do.

      Sugar grabs a second shovel and jumps down into the hole.  A 
      cell phone RINGS.  Both men look around.

                                  SUGAR (CONT D)
                    That you?

      Lucas shakes his head no.  He climbs out of the grave, goes 
      through the dead sheriff s pockets, pulls out his ringing 
      cell phone.  On the screen it says  MAYOR KENDALL.   Sugar 
      shakes his head at Lucas, don t do it.

      Lucas pushes TALK, answers the phone.

                                  LUCAS
                    Hello.                                                                                    23.


                                  MAYOR KENDALL (V.O.)
                    Sheriff Hood?  Mayor Dan Kendall.  
                    Am I catching you at a bad time?

      Phone to his ear, Lucas crouches, rifles the dead sheriff s 
      pockets, finds a bloody badge that says LUCAS HOOD, SHERIFF, 
      BANSHEE, PA.  

                                  MAYOR KENDALL (CONT D)
                    Sheriff?  Are you there?

      Lucas studies the badge, a wild idea firming up in his mind.

                                  LUCAS
                    Yes, this is Hood.   

      Sugar shakes his head at Lucas, incredulous.

                                  MAYOR KENDALL (V.O.)
                    How s the drive going?

                                  LUCAS
                    Less to see than you d think.

                                  MAYOR KENDALL (V.O.)
                    I just wanted to confirm our 
                    breakfast Friday.  You ll be here 
                    by then?

                                  LUCAS
                    I should be.

                                  MAYOR KENDALL (V.O.)
                    Great.  So that s nine am at the 
                    Gravy Train.  I m looking forward 
                    to meeting you in person.

                                  LUCAS
                    I ll see you there.

      Lucas hangs up, pockets the phone.  He looks up to see Sugar 
      gazing at him with bemused curiosity.

                                  SUGAR
                    Tell me you have some kind of 
                    master plan here?

                                  LUCAS
                    I usually just get by on my charm.

      He kicks one thug s protruding leg down into the grave.                                                                                    24.



      Sugar, carrying linens and a pillow, walks Lucas up an 
      external staircase.  Lucas stops, transfixed by THE MOON 
      hanging low over the woods.  Sugar looks on, understanding. 

                                  SUGAR
                    There s a lot of things that are 
                    hard about getting out.  But seeing 
                    the moon again ain t one of them.



      ...and bursts out onto the upper landing of the stairs.  He 
      grasps the railing, haunted and trembling in the cold gray 
      dawn.  Behind him, through trees, the lake glistens.



      On the shore, Lucas does push-ups furiously.  Still only in 
      jeans, he has vicious knife scars across his back.  He 
      finishes his push-ups, then kneels, panting, staring at the 
      water, his face looking haunted.



      Kai Proctor steps out of the Bentley and surveys his 
        surroundings like he owns them.  

      A VERY LARGE ROTTWEILER also hops out of the Bentley and 
      follows Proctor toward The Forge.  At Proctor s command, the 
      dog sits, stationing itself in front of the restaurant while 
      its master steps inside.                                                                                    28.



      The sidewalk outside the salon bustles with pedestrians.  



      Elvis sits in the Range Rover, singing along to Justin 
      Bieber.  


      INTERCUT BETWEEN THE BACK ALLEY AND THE HISHI BASEMENT LAIR:


      IN THE LAIR

      The two men look around at all the equipment.  As Buzz Cut 
      presses a rag to his jaw, Widow s Peak looks at the naked-
      women screen-saver.  He touches the screen, the screen-saver 
      disappears, replaced by the image of the deleting program. 

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    Shit!                                                                                    33.


      They draw their guns and rush over to the closet.


      IN THE BACK ALLEY

      Elvis, still singing to himself, sees the bloodied Job emerge 
      from the building.

                                  ELVIS
                            (immediately hysterical)
                    Oh my God!  Oh my God!


      IN THE LAIR

      Both men stand in the closet.

                                  BUZZ CUT
                    The fuck did he go?

      Widow s Peak spots the stairs in the back.

                                    WIDOW S PEAK
                    There!

      They run for the stairs.


      IN THE BACK ALLEY

      Job pulls out a small disc that he is wearing on a chain 
      around his neck.  The disc has a red button in the center.

      As Job struts away from the building, he pushes the button.  
      Behind him... 

      THE SALON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL.  As flames and 
      bricks fly behind him in slow motion, Job keeps walking, 
      unfazed.



      Lucas steps out of the diner: beside him is MAYOR KENDALL.

                                  LUCAS
                    Thank you for breakfast.

                                  DAN
                    My pleasure.  

      As they walk, Lucas checks out the town, assessing 
      everything, including the mayor at his side. 

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    I pissed off half the City Council 
                    when I authorized Sheriff Hale to 
                    bring in a ringer.  But someone s 
                    got to break Proctor s choke hold 
                    on this town.  Every sheriff we ve 
                    had, including your predecessor, 
                    has ended up on Proctor s payroll.

                                  LUCAS
                    Hale was crooked?

                                  DAN
                    Till he got sick.  Then he got 
                    religion.

                                  LUCAS
                    You brought me in to take down one 
                    guy?

                                  DAN
                    He s not just one guy.  There s no 
                    criminal enterprise around here 
                    that doesn t start and end in his 
                    pockets.  

                                  LUCAS
                    Aren t you a bit young for a mayor?

                                  DAN
                    I had my reasons.
                          (changes the subject)
                    I know you don t start till Monday, 
                    but I figured I d take you by the 
                    Cadi.

                                  LUCAS
                    The Cadi?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    36.



      The Banshee Sheriff s Department is in an old car dealership.  
      Floor to ceiling windows, and a large front lot.  Up on the 
      wall, the letters  CADI  are all that remain of the fallen 
      Cadillac logo.  Dan and Lucas stand in the lot, taking it in.

                                  DAN
                    The old Sheriff s Department burned 
                    down three years ago.  Electrical 
                    fire.  Someone in City Hall had let 
                    the insurance policy lapse and they 
                    didn t have money to rebuild.  
                    Froemer s Cadillac had just gone 
                    under, so...

      He gestures at the building, looking a bit chagrined.



      Lucas approaches the Moody brothers:

                                  LUCAS
                    Why don t we all take a moment and 
                    talk this out?

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Who the fuck are you?

                                  LUCAS
                    Lucas Hood.  I m the new sheriff.                                                                                    40.


      Cole looks over to Brock.

                                  MARCUS MOODY
                    Lotus, I thought you were supposed 
                    to take over when Hale kicked.

                                  BROCK
                    Yeah, you and me both.

      Reaction shot of Lucas looking at Brock: now he gets it.

      The Amish man tries to stand up: Cole kicks him back down.

                                  BROCK (CONT D)
                    That s enough, Cole.  I m sure your 
                    wife s got better things to do than 
                    bail your ass out of jail again.

      Lucas steps between the Moodys and the fallen Amish man.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    Hey, I m not through with him.

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah, you are.

                                  DEX MOODY
                    If you re the sheriff, why aren t 
                    you in uniform?

                                  LUCAS
                    I don t get sworn in until Monday.

                                  COLE MOODY
                    So there s nothing stopping us from 
                    fucking your shit up today.

                                  LUCAS
                          (grins)
                    I hoped you d make that connection. 
                    Come on, Cole.  Fuck my shit up. 

      The Moody brothers leave the Amish man and surround Lucas.  
      Brock draws his gun.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Relax, Brock.  I got this. 

                                  BROCK
                    You sure?

      When Lucas nods, Brock snorts (like  your funeral ) and 
      holsters his weapon.                                                                                    41.


                                  COLE MOODY
                          (at Lucas)
                    Just to be clear, I m about to 
                    pound a civilian, not a-

      Before Cole can finish his sentence, LUCAS DRIVES A HEEL KICK 
      INTO THE GUY S CHEST THAT SENDS HIM FLYING BACKWARDS.

      Dex punches Lucas in the face.  Lucas blocks the follow-up 
      and hits him with four speed punches to the solar plexus, 
      finishing him off with A MUAY THAI STYLE KNEE TO THE FACE.

      REACTION SHOT OF BROCK: he s stunned at Lucas s skills.  

      TOM PULLS A HAMMER from his tool belt and charges Lucas, 
      swinging.  Lucas ducks the swing only to be kicked in the 
      head by Marcus.  Tom comes back at him with the hammer.  
      Lucas grabs Tom s wrist, and flips him into a pallet of 
      cinder blocks. 

      Cole, back on his feet, comes up behind Lucas wielding a long 
      pipe.  He pulls back to swing at Lucas s head, when a hand 
      appears from off camera and grabs the pipe, stopping its 
      motion. 

      WIDER: Lucas and Cole both turn at the same time to see Kai 
      Proctor standing behind Cole, holding the pipe.

                                    PROCTOR
                    That s enough, Moody.

      Proctor s presence takes the fight out of the Moodys.  The 
      fallen brothers slowly get to their feet, groaning.  

                                  COLE MOODY
                          (instantly docile)
                    Mr. Proctor.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Four on one should be enough of an 
                      advantage, without adding plumbing 
                      implements into the mix.

      Lucas helps the fallen Amish man to his feet.  Cole Moody and 
      his brothers start to leave.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Hold on.

      The Moodys pause and look at Proctor.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                          (indicates the Amish men)
                    These men have a schedule to keep. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    42.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Why don t you boys help them load 
                    their wagons.

      The Moody brothers start dejectedly loading lumber onto the 
      wagons.  The Amish men do so too.  Proctor looks to Lucas.  

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    And you are...?

                                  LUCAS
                    Lucas Hood.

                                    PROCTOR
                    The new sheriff.

      Proctor shakes Lucas s hand.  Meanwhile Cole Moody glares 
      furtively at an older Amish man loading lumber beside him.  

                                  COLE MOODY
                          (under his breath at the 
                          old Amish man)
                    Fuckin  Dutchie.  This isn t over.

                                    PROCTOR
                          (to Lucas)
                    Kai Proctor.  I m sorry if I 
                    stepped on your toes here.   

                                  LUCAS
                          (looks at the Moodys 
                            obeying Proctor)
                    Mr. Proctor, what exactly do you-

                                    PROCTOR
                    I m in meats.

      He hands Lucas a card.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    Come by the slaughterhouse.  I ll 
                    set you up with some steaks.

      Lucas considers the card. 

      CLOSE ON: Proctor s card.  It says  PROCTOR MEATS.   The logo 
      is a flank of red raw beef.

      Lucas takes one last appraising look at Proctor, then he 
      heads over to Brock.  

                                  BROCK
                          (still incredulous at 
                            Lucas s handiwork)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    43.

                                  BROCK (CONT'D)
                    You know, some people call us peace 
                      officers... 

      Lucas pats Brock s shoulder and walks off toward the car.  
      Brock shakes his head and follows.  

      Lucas sees a BMW coupe passing by on the street.  Deva 
      Hopewell is riding shotgun, beside an older BOY, 18.  Lucas 
      watches as the BMW turns into a supermarket parking lot far 
      down the street.

                                  LUCAS
                    Thanks for the tour, Brock.  I m 
                    going to take a walk.

      Lucas walks off, as a perplexed Brock watches him go.

      BACK ON PROCTOR who is watching the Amish men secure their 
      load.  Moody and his men have finished helping: they leave.  

      Proctor approaches the oldest Amish man tying down lumber.

                                    PROCTOR
                    It s good to see you, father.

      The man stops what he s doing, his face suddenly strained.  
      Kai stands there, but the man won t meet his gaze.  Kai holds 
      his ground, his face a mixture of pain and contempt.

                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                          (bitterly)
                    You re welcome, by the way.

      Only once Kai has walked away toward his Bentley does his 
      father, ISRAEL PROCTOR (65), look up to watch him go.



      The BMW is parked near a Dumpster, away from other cars. 



      The boy lowers his window as Deva walks away.  

                                  BOY
                          (joking)
                    But I love you!

      Deva laughs and flips him the bird.  Then she turns to go and 
      collides with...LUCAS, who is walking into the lot.

                      LUCASDEVA
      Sorry.No, my bad...

      She moves around him and heads out of the lot.  Lucas makes 
      sure she isn t watching him, then opens her wallet (which he 
      just picked from her pocket).  He sees her HIGH SCHOOL ID, in 
      the transparent pocket of the wallet.

      CLOSE-UP INSERT OF PART OF THE ID:    DOB 6/28/97 

                                  LUCAS (O.C.)
                          (to himself)
                    Thirteen years old, my ass...

      BACK ON LUCAS as he flips the wallet shut.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Deva!

      She turns, surprised.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    You dropped this.

      Deva walks back to him.  He hands her the wallet.  She takes 
      it but regards him suspiciously. 

                                  DEVA
                    How d you know my name?

                                  LUCAS
                    It s on your ID.                                                                                    45.


                                  DEVA
                    Right.  Well, thanks.

      She starts walking off again.

                                  LUCAS
                    Your boyfriend can t give you a 
                    lift back to school?

      Deva turns, backing away as she responds.  

                                  DEVA
                    Who says he s my boyfriend?

                                  LUCAS
                    Well, I hope he s not your brother.

      She laughs.

                                  DEVA
                    Who says I m going back to school?

      She turns and leaves. Quietly stricken, Lucas watches her go.



      The metallic warehouse on the edge of town.  



      In the back alley, Lucas, dressed in black, wearing a small 
      black knapsack, climbs some external pipes up to the roof.  
      He kneels by a large AIR HANDLER, and pulls a power drill and 
      bits out of his knapsack.  He whistles quietly to himself as 
      he matches a bit to the bolts on the air handler.

      Lucas unscrews the bolts with the drill and turns the handler 
      on its side.  He unscrews the exposed duct beneath it and 
      pushes it aside, then lowers himself into the pawn shop. 

      Using a penlight, Lucas casually browses the showcases.  On 
      the wall behind one of the counters, his light falls upon a 
      large CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BELT.                                                                                     49.


      Penlight in his mouth, he picks the lock on a steel door to a 
      back office and steps in.  He looks around, then walks to a 
      painting and pulls it off to reveal a wall safe.  He smiles. 



      THE MUSIC CONTINUES: Lucas, flanked by his deputies, exits 
      the town hall and surveys Banshee s Main Street.



      Lucas gets into his official Sheriff s car and, with Emmett 
      riding shotgun, Sheriff Lucas Hood drives back into town.

      THE MUSIC ENDS.




      CLOSE ON: AN ICE SCULPTURE OF THE MUSCULAR, MYTHOLOGICAL 
      ATLAS CARRYING THE WORLD ON HIS SHOULDERS

      Champagne spills down over the sculpture into a basin of ice.  
      A server ladles it into flutes.  SOUND of LIVE ROCKABILLY.

                                                                WIDER TO REVEAL:

      On a grand patio overlooking a sweeping green lawn, well-
      dressed MEN AND WOMEN mingle.  SERVERS in white coats 
      circulate with trays, offering champagne and rare beef on 
      skewer points.  A four-piece BAND plays near a dance floor.

      An in-ground swimming pool is near the patio and floating 
      atop the water are two dozen Japanese paper LANTERNS.                                                                                    52.


      Lucas stands talking with Emmett and his wife, MEG (35), a 
      blond knockout.

                                  MEG
                    Where will you be living, Sheriff?

                                  LUCAS
                    I m still working that out.

      Dan Kendall joins them in a blazer and tie. 

                                  DAN
                    Sheriff, if you ll come with me, 
                    it s meet-and-greet time... 

      He pulls Lucas away from them, just as Brock arrives.

                                  BROCK
                    Emmett.  Meg.

                                  MEG
                    Hey, Brock.

                                  BROCK
                          (eyeing Lucas)
                    I m telling you, there s something 
                    wrong with that guy.

                                  EMMETT
                    He seems up for the job.

                                  BROCK
                    You didn t see him take down the 
                    Moody boys.  He went through them 
                    like they were cardboard. 

                                  EMMETT
                    So, you re upset that our sheriff 
                    knows how to fight.

                                  BROCK
                    It wasn t fighting.  It was fucking 
                    combat.

                                  MEG
                    Emmett, if you insist on talking 
                    shop, I ll find someone else to 
                    dance with.

                                  EMMETT
                    But baby, would he have my moves?

      Emmett follows her to the dance floor and we CUT TO...                                                                                    53.


      Carrie and Gordon arriving through an archway leading from 
      the house down a grand staircase onto the patio and back 
      lawn.

                                  GORDON
                          (sardonic)
                      Understated, as usual.

                                  CARRIE
                    Only in Banshee would a DA attend a 
                    party at the home of the guy he 
                    just brought up on racketeering 
                    charges.

                                  GORDON
                    Well, you know what they say...if 
                    you can t beat  em, drink their 
                    booze.  I ll find the bar.

      He wanders off.  Carrie moves around the perimeter of the 
      party, occasionally smiling or returning a greeting.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



      The party s in full swing.  Proctor arrives at the archway, 
      looking sharp in a dark Armani suit, and surveys the crowd 
      below like a sovereign ruler, before heading down the stairs, 
      greeting numerous luminaries along the way.

      Lucas stands by a wet bar not far from the pool, talking to 
      Dan and some other men.  Proctor approaches Lucas.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Sheriff Hood.

                                  LUCAS
                    Mr. Proctor.  This is some shindig.

      They shake hands.

                                    PROCTOR
                    You ll find out that Banshee is not 
                    at all the backwater town it 
                    sometimes pretends to be.
                          (to Dan)
                    Good evening, Mayor.

      He extends his hand.  The Mayor doesn t shake it.  A beat of 
      tension as Proctor withdraws his hand.                                                                                    54.


                                    PROCTOR (CONT D)
                    I ll chalk up your bad manners to 
                    your age, and choose not to take 
                    offense.

                                  DAN
                    No, please.  Take offense.

      Proctor smiles dangerously, like Dan is a mosquito he could 
      crush at will.  There s clearly some bad blood here.  Then 
      Proctor turns to Lucas.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Enjoy the party, Sheriff.  And 
                    welcome to Banshee.

      Proctor moves off into the crowd.  Looking over Lucas s 
      shoulder, Dan sees Carrie moving through the party.

                                  DAN
                    Carrie!  Come meet the sheriff.

      Carrie steps over just as Lucas turns around to face her.  
      She is stunned.

                                  LUCAS
                    Lucas Hood.  It s a pleasure to 
                    meet you.

      Carrie s jaw has dropped. 

                                  DAN
                    Um, Carrie?

      She snaps out of it, shakes Lucas s hand and offers a smile.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m sorry- I m not myself tonight.

      Gordon wanders over with two drinks, hands one to Carrie.

                                  GORDON
                    Good, so you two have met?

                    Mrs. Hopewell, you don t sound like 
                    you re from around here. 

                                  GORDON
                    You ve got a good ear, Sheriff. 
                    She s from New England, originally.                                                                                    55.

                                  LUCAS
                     The Northeast Kingdom.   That 
                    sounds like something out of a 
                      fairytale, you know?  Like 
                    something made up.

      Carrie, simmering, registers the jab.  Siobahn appears at 
      Lucas s side in a strapless red dress.

                                    SIOBAHN
                    Hey boss!  Congratulations.

                                  LUCAS
                    Deputy Kelly, you are wearing the 
                    hell out of that dress.

                                    SIOBAHN
                    You re only saying that because 
                    it s true.

                                  LUCAS
                    Well, Mrs. Hopewell.  Very nice to 
                    meet you. 

      He walks off with Siobahn on his arm, leaving a stunned 
      Carrie in the b.g.  



      Sugar finishes locking up and walks around back to his small 
      house.  He discovers his front door slightly open.



      Carrie stands in the dark, leaning against a car, having a 
      quick smoke.  Lucas emerges beside her.

                                  LUCAS
                    Still sneaking cigarettes, huh?

      Carrie is momentarily startled, then shakes her head and puts 
      out the cigarette.  She looks at him.

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    So...

                                  CARRIE
                          (irate)
                      A sheriff?  What the hell are you 
                    doing?

                                  LUCAS
                    They ve got a great health plan.

                                  CARRIE
                    You won t need it in prison.

                                  LUCAS
                    You used to have more faith in me.

      He starts to move toward his Sheriff s car, parked a few cars 
      down.  Carrie grabs his arm: her touch jolts him.

                                  CARRIE
                    Why are you doing this?

                                  LUCAS
                    You know why.

      They share a look weighted with pain and history.  Finally, 
      Lucas walks to the back of his car and pops the trunk.  

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    Come here a second.

      She joins him.  In the trunk is the wall safe from the pawn 
      shop, with bits of drywall still stuck to it.


      A SHOT FROM OUT OF THE TRUNK UP AT THE TWO OF THEM

                                  LUCAS (CONT D)
                    It s an Empire, Mercury series. 
                    I ve got no tools, but you could do 
                    this in your sleep.                                                                                    57.


                                  CARRIE
                          (incredulous)
                    I can t fucking believe this.

                                  LUCAS
                    Come on, it s the least you can do.

                                  CARRIE
                    No!  This - what you re doing - is 
                    crazy. If you don t end it, I will.

                                  LUCAS
                    You re not in the position to blow 
                    any whistles, Carrie from Vermont.  
                    I ve already gone down alone once.  
                    I won t do it again.

                                  CARRIE
                    You re insane.

      She storms away.  Lucas shrugs and closes the trunk.

      As Lucas ambles back toward the mansion, he hears movement 
      behind him.  He half turns to see who s there, and we see...

      COLE MOODY S GROTESQUELY BLOATED AND BATTERED FACE.  Moody 
      swings something at Lucas s head, too fast for Lucas to 
      react, and we SLAM TO BLACK.



      Carrie, standing beside Gordon, checks her iPhone.

                                  GORDON
                    The kids?

                                  CARRIE
                    No, but can we pretend?

                                  GORDON
                          (smiles)
                    I think we ve stayed long enough.

      They put down their glasses and, holding hands, move toward 
      Proctor to make their good-byes.  Proctor is standing near 
      the bar, entertaining a small circle of guests.

                                  GORDON (CONT D)
                    Kai.  Thanks for having us.

                                    PROCTOR
                    Gordon.  Glad you stopped by.                                                                                    58.


      They shake hands.

                                  GORDON
                    This isn t awkward at all.

      Proctor smiles.  But before he can respond...

      A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, and a bullet hits the bottles on the wet 
      bar between him and the Hopewells.  They jump back in shock.

      ON MOODY, his face bruised and swollen, moving wildly through 
      the crowd pointing a .357 Magnum.  Moody s mouth, almost 
      devoid of teeth, is a bloody mess.

                                  MOODY
                          (screaming, drunk)
                      PROCTOR!!!!

      Guests scream and run for cover.  Gordon turns, frozen in 
      place, but CARRIE TAKES HIM DOWN HARD just as Moody shoots 
      again.  The shot hits the bar, just above Proctor s head as 
      he hits the deck.

      Proctor backs up against the bottom of the wet bar.  He has 
      nowhere left to go.  Carrie and Gordon lie on the ground with 
      a few others in the area between Moody and Proctor.

      SLOW-MO: Moody levels his gun at Proctor.  Proctor looks up 
      at him with fearless contempt.  

                                  MOODY (CONT D)
                          (garbled)
                    Dutchie Motherfucker.

      Moody starts to squeeze the trigger, when TWO GUNSHOTS go off 
      and TWO ROUNDS RIP INTO MOODY S CHEST.  MOODY FLIES OFF HIS 
      FEET AND INTO THE POOL.

      HARD PAN across to see LUCAS, STANDING SHAKILY UNDER THE 
      ARCHWAY, GUN EXTENDED, blood pouring down his face from a 
      gash on his forehead. 

      Carrie, Proctor, and everyone else stares at him as he holds 
      onto the archway with one arm for support, straining to stay 
      upright and conscious.

      PULL BACK ON THE GRISLY TABLEAU:  Moody floats dead in the 
      pool, blood billowing out from him, as the floating paper 
      lanterns swirl and eddy around Moody s corpse.                                                                                      59.



      Widow s Peak walks down the sidewalk, limping slightly.  We 
      only see the right side of his face.  He comes to an unmarked 
      old door between two shops.  He looks above the door at an 
      unseen camera.  The door CLICKS open.
