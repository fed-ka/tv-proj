with tears, then rushes to his family.Sachs&Judah After Hours NBC Draft 8/14/1256.


TC
How amazing was that?

Just as TC and Jordan are having a moment, they turn and see 
an ORDERLY, followed by Althea, pushing in the Drunk Driver 
patient on a gurney.  Althea storms up to TC.

JORDAN

ALTHEA

Jordan looks at TC, unsure what to think, then exits after 
Althea.  TC looks over at the Drunk Driver and goes to his

eyes.

TC

Topher takes out a thick envelope and slides it to her. 

TOPHER

work again.

She opens it and sees it is full of cash.



Ragosa opens the envelope and counts the money.

RAGOSA

TC (CONT D)
So, breakfast is on me.  All the 
bacon you can eat.

Everybody cheers again as the entire staff starts to exit.   
TC stops, and turns, and heads back to Jordan.  He pulls a 
thick file out of his backpack and hands it to Jordan.
