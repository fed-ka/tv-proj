      We see the back of a CREEPY GUY as he jiggles the back door.  *


      Tommy gets out of the car in front of an ARMY SURPLUS STORE. *

                                  BEN*
                    Whatever you do, don t tell K-A-T-E.  *

                                    MADDIE*
                    That spells Kate.  Mommy s my best *
                    friend.  We have matching pajamas *
                    and I m not allowed to eat wheat.  *

      Tommy leans into Maddie s window--*

                                  TOMMY*
                    Don t you want a little half-*
                    brother who s a natural blonde and *
                    a great athlete?  *

      As Ben peels away.... *


      The sun shines on the Spanish-style duplex.  


      Kate and Ben walk to the car as Maddie trails behind.   *

                                  KATE*
                    How did you have time to sleep with *
                    the babysitter?!*

                                  BEN*
                    It was this morning.  I got nervous *
                    about crashing the wedding...one *
                    thing led to another....  I got her *
                      a water... *

                                  KATE*
                    Your whole life you can t follow *
                    through on anything and all of a *
                    sudden you follow through on, like, *
                    ten bad things?*

      Ben shrugs.  *

                                  BEN*
                    I guess I m just growing up.  *

                                  KATE*
                    No, Ben, you re not...and you need *
                    to.  *

                                  BEN
                    Hello?!  I know where the emergency *
                    kit is, I have all the numbers, and *
                    I watched your stupid earthquake *
                    video again.    

      POP TO a bad home video.  The CAMERA shakes like an 
      earthquake as Kate army-crawls under the kitchen table.  Bad 
      graphics pop up, pointing to exits.  The camera drops and we 
      see Maddie run under too.  BACK TO SCENE.  Maddie looks up at *
      her mom:*

                                    MADDIE*
                    You look like a movie star!*

                                  KATE
                    I forgot how good it feels to get 
                    dressed up.  Well, my feet are 
                    killing me, but you know what I 
                    mean.  
                          (to Ben)*
                    Thanks for making me do this.  And *
                    don t worry, I ll be back by five 
                    so you can crash your wedding.*
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    21.

                                  KATE (CONT'D)
                    And hey, did I tell you I started a *
                    patent application for your kitchen *
                    steps?  I m calling them  kitchen *
                    steps  but it s just a working title. *

                                  BEN
                    Okay, now you re just stalling. 

      Kate flashes him a look and gets in her car.


      BJ pulls Kate s Mommy-mobile into the parking lot, screeching *
      to a stop.  Ben and Kate jump out, running in.  *
