      Nick is getting into his car, growling with pain.

                    I m good! Totally good--

      The group watches, worried. He tries to adjust his seat. 
      Suddenly, the car lurches and speeds OUT OF FRAME. CRASH! 
      They rush to Nick s car, as he climbs out with much effort.

      REVEAL Nick has hit Winston s car: What used to be a nice, 
      low-level luxury car is now a beat-up car that was clearly a 
      disaster even before Nick hit it. Nick points to a tiny dent. 

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Winston, this is what I did.
                    The rest was already there.

      Jess picks up a magazine as Nick looks around. Sees that the 
      other patients in the waiting room are FOUR HUGELY PREGNANT 
      WOMEN. Suspicious. He looks up to see the wall is covered in 
      framed Georgia O Keefe prints. Something dawns on him.

                    Hey man.

      Nick turns to see Schmidt, Winston, and Jess sitting at the 
      bar. They all stare at him, too intensely. 

                                    SCHMIDT (CONT D)
                    How are you feeling, man?

      Schmidt breathes deeply trying to control his emotion.

                    Come on, Schmidt, he s fine. You re 
                    fine, right? Look at you. You re

                                  NICK
                    I don t have anything.

      Winston punches Nick in the arm which aggravates his injury.

      Winston punches Nick in the arm again. Nick groans.

                    Winston, please- Just go sit down-- 

      Jess and Winston go sit at a table. Nick takes another pain 
      pill. A WOMAN BARFLY watches him.

                    I take those, too. When I got a

      Nick takes another pill. CECE enters. Walks over to the bar. 

                                  CECE
                    Hey. I heard. 

                                  NICK
                    Yeah. Of course you did. 

      Nick waits for her to say something. She just stares at him.

                    Can I get a vodka soda? 

      Nick looks surprised at first, then nods. Smiles.

                    Thank you, Cece.

      Jess, Schmidt, and Winston sit in a booth. Schmidt and 
      Winston look at their phones. Cece is at the bar, talking on

      Nick delivers drinks to Jess, Schmidt and Winston. Schmidt

                    You want me to get real and stop

      Schmidt tries to do a beat over the next couple of lines.

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    You have no insurance. I mean, what

                    have wanted to do something with

                    I ve done things.  
                          (thinking)
                    I... wrote half a novel about 
                    zombies. I didn t even spell it 
                    like  zombie.  I spelled it with an

                    So fine. I haven t done a lot with 
                    my life. Why are we talking about 
                    this?

                                  JESS
                    Just tell me. What would you do if 
                    you could do anything?  Go. Go.  
                    Off the top of your head.

                                  NICK
                    I always saw myself having a couple 
                    weird kids. Having a family. 
                    Falling in love. And I can t even- 
                    I can t even call a girl who I 
                    like. Who likes me. Like Julia. I 
                    stopped calling her. I ve never 
                    just jumped into something and not 
                    cared what was going to happen. 
                    Like, if everyone decides to swim 
                    naked in the ocean, I m the guy on

                                  JESS
                    So fine. Nick. Are you going to be 
                    someone who does things or are you 
                    going to be someone who doesn t do 
                    things?    
                          (then)
                    That sounded smarter in my head. 


      Everyone charges in. They all look a mess. Nick approaches 
      the window.

                                  NICK
                    Nick Miller. I have a nine A.M.

      The RECEPTIONIST hands Nick a clipboard of papers.

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    Fill these out. I m gonna need a 
                    copy of your health insurance. 

                                  NICK
                    I don t have any. 
                          (off her look)
                    I m paying with cash. It s actually 
                    a mixture of paper money and change. 
                    And a post-dated check, and I ve got 
                    a 60/40 shot it s going to clear. 


      The gang sits nervously waiting for Nick.

                                    SCHMIDT
                          (on the phone)
                    Yeah, I m not going to be able to 
                    come in today. Yeah. I just can t 
                    work when I m this emotionally 
                    fragile. 
                          (then)
                    No, it s not technically a personal 
                    day, because it s for my friend--

      Cece rolls her eyes. Jess looks nervous. Winston squeezes her 
      arm. Finally, Nick EMERGES. They all look at him expectantly.

                                  NICK
                    It s not... I m fine... I m okay.    NEW GIRL  #109     "Injured"      FINAL COLLATED DRAFT      29.


      Everyone breathes a sigh of relief and rushes to him. 

                                  JESS
                    What is it? What did they say? 

                                  NICK
                    No idea. Didn t hear a word after 
                     It s not cancer.  It s like a cyst 
                    or something. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                          (overly emotional)
                    I can t- I just--

      He can t handle it and grabs Nick once again to kiss him 
        Fredo-style. Nick throws him off.

                                  NICK
                       Don t Fredo-kiss me, Schmidt. 

      Nick crosses back to the window and pulls out his sandwich 
      bag/wallet. He fishes for his license and debit card.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    I have a three hundred dollar limit 
                    on this card, but--

                                  RECEPTIONIST
                    It s already taken care of.

                                  NICK
                    What?

      He stops and turns to the group. 

                                  JESS
                    We split it.

                                  NICK
                    I ll- I ll pay you--

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Just get some health insurance. 
                    It s not cute anymore.  

                                    WINSTON
                    And get a wallet.


      Nick slides in next to Jess in the backseat. Silence, then:

                                  NICK
                    What happened last night?

      Jess gets Nick s phone out of his pocket. 

                                  JESS
                    Call her. 

      Winston turns the key, but the car won t turn over. He tries 
      again. Nothing. Everyone looks at each other, then one by 
      one, they get out of the car.
