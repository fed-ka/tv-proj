      A BLUE CURRENT of ELECTRICITY snakes through a grid of rusted 
      pipes, twisting up around spliced wires and rippling down to 
      gold-plated NEEDLES that pierce the skin of Derek s torso. 

      His body arcs up, the ELECTRICAL CHARGE pulling his muscles 
      into painful contractions while--


      Pedal to the floor, Allison pushes her car past SIXTY, 
      driving far too fast down suburban roads. The moment she 
      blinks, she s--


      Back in the dimly-lit basement, watching Kate dial down the 
      current at a control board. THE STATIC BUZZ fades allowing 
      Derek to collapse back against the restraints. Still 
        transformed, he gasps weakly.

      Barely breathing herself, Allison keeps her distance. 

                                    ALLISON
                    What is he?

                                  KATE
                    I think you already know the answer 
                    to that.

      Allison shakes her head.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Sure you do. Maybe you don t want 
                    to say it because it gets a little 
                    too real when you hear it out loud? 
                      Shape-shifter. Lycan. Werewolf. 
                    Whatever. To me he s just another 
                    dumb animal.

                                    ALLISON
                    What are you doing to him? Is that 
                    going to kill him?            TEEN WOLF "Episode 111"BLUE DRAFT2/13/112.

                    Oh, kiddo, don t get all ethical on 
                    me. The electric charge just keeps *
                    him friendly.*

      She pushes Derek s chin up, then pulls his lips back like a 
      vet might with a dog to inspect its gums.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    See these? Canines. Also known as 
                    fangs. Made for the rending and 
                    tearing of flesh. Not something you 
                    find on cute, leaf-eating 
                      herbivores.

      Gripping his chin, Kate fearlessly pulls Derek closer.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    You know, there was an ancient 
                    breed of gray wolves whose teeth 
                    could crush bone? How hot is that?

                                    ALLISON
                    This is a joke to you.

                      Sweetheart, werewolves are running 
                    around in the world. Everything s a 
                    joke to me. How else do you think I 
                    stay sane?

      She casually drops Derek s head, letting his chin fall to his 
      chest as--


      Allison snaps her head up. Hurtling too fast toward the RED 
      BRAKE LIGHTS of the cars ahead, she swerves into the next 
      lane and--


      Down a dark corridor, Allison follows Kate.

                                    ALLISON
                    So was it him in the school? And *

      THE ENGINE ROARS as Allison whips around a turn. She doesn t 
      see a POLICE CAR burst out of the shadows behind her, LIGHTS 
      coming on while--


      FLORESCENT BULBS flicker across the ceiling of the corridor 
      where Kate leads Allison out.

      SIRENS BLARING behind her car, Allison looks into the rear 
      view mirror at the RED and BLUE FLASHING LIGHTS. 

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh, come on, not now.

      She quickly pulls to the side of the road and parks.

                    Stupid, stupid, stupid.

      Grabbing her license and registration, she rolls down the 
      window. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM flares in on her and--

      Derek SNAPS out with his teeth.

      Allison flinches, squinting in the beam of light. When it 
      moves, she finds herself peering up at Sheriff Stilinski.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Allison? Are you all right?

                    Yeah. I m sorry I was going so 
                    fast. I didn t realize... I...

      But as she stammers, the teenage year-old girl begins to 
      surface. Practically strangling the steering wheel with her 
      hands, she can t fight what s about to happen.

      away, she glances up with an embarrassed smile.

      A BLACK BAG drops onto the bed. Allison unzips it to reveal 
      the separated parts of her COMPOUND BOW.

      With steady hands and precise movements, she begins piecing 
      it together. Snapping the optical sight into place, she yanks 
      back on the bowstring. Aiming right at--

      Scott snaps awake, sitting up on the steel table in the 
      examining room. His feet land on the concrete floor as Deaton 
      steps out from around the corner.

                                  DEATON
                    Welcome back to the land of the 
                      conscious. You doing okay?

      Scott answers by swaying back, looking as if he might pass 
      out. Deaton takes his arm, keeping him from falling.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Maybe you should sit down.

      A CHIME RINGS through the Clinic, causing them both to look 
      up. They hear a SLIGHT CREAK, the front door opening and then 
      easing shut.

      Deaton cocks his head to listen. Scott s grip on his arm 
      begins to tighten, fear renewing his strength.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Hello?

      No response comes. Scott pulls at Deaton, trying to draw him 
      back. But the man remains perfectly calm.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                          (calling out)
                    I m sorry, but we re closed.

      From around the corner comes the slightest sound of 
      FOOTFALLS. 

      Deaton starts forward, but Scott digs into his sleeve. 
      Gently, Deaton pries his fingers off and gives a reassuring 
      smile. He steps toward--

      THE FRONT OF THE OFFICE - where Peter Hale stands just inside 
      the door.

                                  PETER

      IN THE EXAMINING ROOM - Scott hides in a corner against the 
      brick wall. He listens, breath held as Peter keeps pushing.

                    I think you could make an exception 
                    this one time, don t you?

                                  DEATON
                    I m sorry, that s not going to be 
                    possible. Maybe you could come back 
                    during regular hours.

      Peter loses the smile. He steps toward Deaton.

                                  PETER
                    You have something of mine. I m 
                    here to collect it.

                                  DEATON
                    Like I said... We re closed.

      Peter stops at the gated border between the waiting area and 
      the office used to keep animals out. Confident veneer 
      cracking slightly, he tries to approach the gate again, but 
      it s almost like an invisible barrier presses him back.

      Hand coming up, he traces the tips of his fingers across the 
      two-inch wood surface of the gate.

                                  PETER
                    Made from mountain ash? Right? 
                    That s an old one.

      In the blink of an eye, Peter s hand wraps around one of the 
      CHAIRS in the waiting area. He yanks it up and sends HURTLING 
      over the border to SMASH AGAINST THE WALL. 

      It tumbles to the floor beside Deaton. MOVEMENT comes from 
      the back of the Clinic. Peter glances past him to the sound.

                                  DEATON
                    Let me be as clear as possible. We. 
                    Are. Closed.

      Calm returning, Peter finally gives a polite nod and moves 
      for the door. But with his hand on the knob, he pauses to 
      whisper...            TEEN WOLF "Episode 111"BLUE DRAFT2/13/118.

      IN THE BACK - Scott presses against the brick wall, listening 
      to Peter s voice with his heightened hearing.

                    When you interrupted him trying to

                    He wasn t going to kill anyone. And

                    Could you at least think about

      But before Scott can respond, he HEARS something. The sound 
      of a car ENGINE RUMBLING.

      Hitting END on her phone, Melissa sits there for a long, 
      horrible moment.


      Stiles tries to read Scott s expression.

                                  STILES
                    Is she okay?

      Scott shakes his head no, still listening.

      Melissa wipes the tears at her eyes even as new ones slip 
      down her cheeks, crying quietly in her car.


      Scott slumps down on his bed in utter misery.

      He doesn t see Stiles s pensive expression. CELL PHONE in his 
      hands, Stiles turns it over and over, the kind of mindless 
      action someone takes when they re struggling with a thought. 

      Or with a secret.


      Picking up Derek s jacket, Kate searches the pockets. She 
      pulls out his wallet and begins thumbing through it.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 111"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1112.

      Derek weakly pulls his head up. Returned to normal, his face 
      is pale, body dripping wet.

      In the wallet, Kate finds a LICENSE which shows a typically 
      angry Derek glaring at the DMV camera. She holds it up to 
      compare against the scowling Derek in front of her.

      MARCUS, a very large man who would cause most people to cross 
      the street if he approached, steps out of the shadows.

      Showing no hint of emotion, Kate walks out. Behind her, 
      Marcus cracks his knuckles in anticipation.*

      tosses and turns while outside her window--

      out of their gym clothes to get back to class. Coach barrels

                    So the compromise is I can t go to

                    She knows.

      Melissa SLAPS her palm against Scott s forehead. He gazes 
      back, stunned.

      In his parked car, Jackson leans back, chugging from an 
      unlabeled bottle. Allison watches from the passenger seat 
      with an expression that could only be translated as yeesh. 

      Finally, he lowers the bottle and offers it to her.

      BOOMING MUSIC shakes a stack of amplifiers around a DeeJay. 
      Scott stealthily keeps to the shadows while the rest of his 
      class falls under the glow of multi-colored SPOTLIGHTS.

      Searching the faces, he finds his friends gathering by the 
      tables. Jackson talks with Danny and his BOYFRIEND while 
      spiking red drink cups from his bottle of vodka.

      Letting his gaze wander, Scott spots Coach chatting up 
      another teacher. Then he sees--

      Peter. Right in the middle of the dance floor. But then 
      bodies converge in front of him, teenagers surging to the 
      start of a favorite song.

      And Peter is gone. Scott blinks, not sure now if he was 
      actually there. All he sees are smiling classmates, everyone 
      having a good time. Everyone except--          TEEN WOLF "Episode 111"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1129.

      Stiles and Lydia slump miserably at a table nearby.

                    Not the response I was expecting. 
                    But no. Guess not.

      Jackson takes another shot from his drink. Wincing at the 
      strength of it, he looks down into the cup. Then over to the 
        extraordinarily beautiful Allison.

      Finally, he tosses the still quite full red cup into the 
      trash and holds out his hand to Allison.

      At the table, Stiles sits up to watch them head to the dance 
      floor. He turns to Lydia.

      She holds out her hand to him. Blinking in astonishment, 
      Stiles takes it. And now, with a stupid-happy grin on his 
      face, leads her to the dance floor.

      Neither of them notice Scott standing in the shadows nearby. 
      Having overheard the exchange, he s smiling with pride in his 
      best friend. Until--

      He connects eyes with Coach.

      Pushing through a wave students, Coach heads right for him 
      even as Scott rushes into the jammed dance floor.

      Fast moving bodies jostling him, Coach gets an elbow into the 
      chest. It slows him only momentarily while Scott continues 
      evading. But then the worst happens... A slow song comes on. 

      The floor begins clearing, the uncoupled heading back to 
      tables while the coupled clasp hands to slow dance. 

      Jackson looks at Allison with a shrug. No slow dancing for

      embrace.

      forward as if to chastise a gay couple for dancing with each 
      other in public.

      He lets the bewildered Danny go. Turning around, Danny faces 
      his BOYFRIEND who has returned to the floor with two filled 
      drink cups, eyeing him with a rather displeased look.

      Danny gives a sheepish smile as--

      Allison turns to an approaching Scott. She falls perfectly 
      under the rays of the spotlights as if the moment had been

                    things now. It s all different now. 
                    Just trust me.


      Allison and Scott stop dancing, the conversation bringing 
      them to a halt.

                                  SCOTT
                    You weren t wrong--

                                    ALLISON
                    Yes, I was. The stuff I was saying 
                    was crazy.

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison, please let me talk.

      But the moment she stops to listen, the tempo of the music 
      ratchets up. A THUNDERING BEAT pounds in around them, the 
      dance floor crowding again.

      Unable to be heard, unable to explain, Scott looks at her, 
      desperate to tell her the truth. But then he takes her in his 
      arms and kisses her instead.

      She slowly pulls away to look at him.

                                    ALLISON
                    Why did you do that?

      He says the next words simply and honestly.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 111"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1137.

                                  SCOTT
                    Because I love you.

      And while the world around them flashes by, Allison s hands 
      move slowly up from his shoulders, her fingertips to his 
      cheeks. Looking into his dark eyes, she gently guides his 
      lips back to hers.

      For one moment, completely unaware of everything and everyone 
      around them, they kiss softly and perfectly in the middle of 
      the dance floor.


      But Jackson is nowhere near the lacrosse field, instead 
      wandering back into the dance, a shocked, even perplexed, 
      look on his face. 

      Stiles grabs him by the arm.

                                  STILES
                    Where the hell have you been? Did 
                    Lydia find you?

      In a daze, Jackson shakes his head.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?

                                    JACKSON
                    I was out behind the school. I 
                    was...

                                  STILES
                          (alarmed)
                    What happened? What did you do?          TEEN WOLF "Episode 111"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1138.



      Scott s back slams against a locker, Allison pressing against 
      him. Softly and gently have given way to teenage hormones. 
      They go at it like they re kissing and groping each other for 
      the first time.

      Allison breaks away momentarily, but their faces still touch, 
        cheek-to-cheek, nose-to-nose.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are we going too fast? Should we 
                    try to first work on being friends 
                    again?

                                  SCOTT
                    Can we do that after we get back 
                    together?

                                    ALLISON
                            (breathless)
                    Yeah. Totally.

      And they start kissing again as--
