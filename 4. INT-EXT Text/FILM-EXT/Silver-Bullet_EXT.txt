THE FULL MOON, CLOSE
NIGHT
It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the
warm late summer air.
SOUND: Crickets.
THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO:
TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY
NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT
CREDITS BEGIN.
A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is
ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino
pants. He is drinking beer.
ARNIE (sings)
My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...
He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses
it to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point.
ARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox
on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He
shines it on the switch.
He gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a
pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also
gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back
pocket.
ARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch.
CREDITS CONTINUE.
NIGHT
He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the
light on the switch for a moment. During this:
ARNIE (sings)
It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
frosty treat, won't you try, won't you
buy Rheingold beer...
He tries the switch. No go. It's frozen.
ARNIE
Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!
He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes
a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and
drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty
bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then
he picks up his crowbar.
CREDITS CONTINUE.
THE RAIL-RIDER
NIGHT
There's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out -
something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is
a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes
still hang from it.
What kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as
wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we
should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick
ourselves for not knowing earlier.
It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on
the whole rail-rider.
CREDITS CONCLUDE.
ARNIE
NIGHT
He's working the crowbar into the junction point just as
hard as he can. Swearing at it under his breath. Suddenly,
both the tracks and the switch move.
ARNIE
Hot damn! Now... a little oil...
He turns back toward the rail-rider.
ARNIE, ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER
NIGHT
ARNIE
It's not bitter, not sweet... it's
a big fuckin' treat...
A NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling.
ARNIE looks around.
THE RAILS AND THE SWITCHING POINT, ARNIE'S POV
NIGHT
Nothing there. His bottle of beer stands by the litter of
his tools.
ARNIE, AT THE RAIL-RIDER
NIGHT
He's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching
point.
ARNIE'S BOTTLE OF BEER, CU
NIGHT
A hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws
on that hand.
THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, CU
NIGHT
Glaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is
still half human. That's all we see. The rest is in shadow.
It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer. Foamy
Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat.
ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER
NIGHT
He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the
long spout. He starts back to the switching point, waving
the can.
ARNIE (sings)
My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer...
He arrives, looks down... and stops singing. His eyes widen.
THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV
NIGHT
We can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of
course empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders,
half wolf, half human.
ARNIE
NIGHT
He's beginning to be afraid. Beginning to look around to see
what might be out here with him. Beginning to realize he is
in extremely deep shit.
SOUND: A SHATTERING, SNARLING ROAR
THE WEREWOLF
NIGHT
It rises up on its hind legs, eyes glaring an ugly yellow
green. Its snout wrinkles back, revealing those teeth.
ARNIE
NIGHT
He's craning back to look at the thing, his face a grue of
horror.
ARNIE
Oh n-
A huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down. ARNIE's head is
granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his
body.
THE RAIL-RIDER
NIGHT
SOUND of the beast approaching. A hairy arm and taloned hand
reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages.
The hand is dripping blood.
It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold.
The WEREWOLF begins to sing. It is a bizarre funny-horrible
grunting, the words hellishly recognizable.
WEREWOLF (gutteral; subhuman)
My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
No bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the
bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox. Beer foams
out.
THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, IN DEEP SHADOW
NIGHT
He/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth
and drinks. Foam drizzles down its pelt. It's grinning.
WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...
THE WEREWOLF, CU
NIGHT
The bottle is empty. There are CRUNCHING SOUNDS as it begins
to eat the bottle.
Blood begins to run out of its mouth; its face wrinkles in
pain and fury. It spits out broken, bloody jags of glass.
Looks up. It HOWLS.
TARKER'S MILLS
NIGHT - MOONLIGHT
We're looking at Main Street of a small country town - might
be New England, might be mid-South. Might be 1984, might be
1981. This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time
moves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back and
forth. No one is in a hurry.
We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door);
Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett
neon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see
the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door.
We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia
Loren in "Two Women."
It's Our Town, U.S.A.
JANE (voice-over)
This place is Tarker's Mills, where I
grew up... and this is how it was when I
was fourteen - a place where people cared
about each other as much as they cared
about themselves. This is how my town
looked as, all unknowing, it approached the
rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.
SOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.
TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE
NIGHT
a.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up a
car. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily.
b.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is just
taking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION.
They both look around.
c.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause at
the sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.
THE SETTING MOON, CU
NIGHT
As JANE speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon.
JANE (v-o)
The killing had begun, but at first no
one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic
drunk, and what happened seemed like an
accident.
THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIE'S HEADLESS BODY
NIGHT
Slowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we TIME-LAPSE TO
DAWN.
SOUND: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.
CAMERA MOVES IN. Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle. There
is a litter of ARNIE'S tools. And here, on the cheek of
ARNIE'S severed head, a few ants are checking things out.
SOUND: The train's horn, MUCH CLOSER.
JANE (v-o)
The county coroner concluded that Arnie
passed out on the tracks. There wasn't
enough evidence to conclude anything else.
And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn
blaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappears
underneath. We see something flopping and moving under
there. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't.
DISSOLVE TO:
TARKER'S MILLS TOWN COMMON
DAY
The common is more or less in the center of town, either
surrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent that's been erected on
the Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but
the banner draped over the entrance reads: SUPPORT THE
TARKER'S MILLS MEDCU DRIVE!
Behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been
set out end-to-end. Women are putting salads and home-baked
breads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit
down to a meal when the meeting's over. Further off, men are
tending barbecues, roasting corn, etc.
JOE HALLER (amplified voice)
I'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe,
of Holy Family Catholic Church!
Enthusiastic applause greets this.
A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU
It's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling
through the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF
APPLAUSE.
MARTY (voice)
Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're
not poisonous?
BRADY (voice)
Little old blacksnake? Hell, no!
Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief -
grab the blacksnake.
MARTY AND BRADY, CU
BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with
respectful wonder.
NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion,
and will through the whole movie.
MARTY
Lemme hold him!
BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY
sees:
JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT
DAY
JANE (v-o)
I was almost fifteen that summer. My
brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his
friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I
had to bear. Brady was actually the worse
of the two, but I was rarely disposed to
see that. Not when my younger brother was
so constantly thrown in my face by my
parents.
LOWE (v-o from the tent)
$32,000 is a lot of money. But when you
think of the lives this unit might save, it
seems very inexpensive indeed.
Applause greets this.
MARTY AND BRADY
Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from
waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.
BRADY
I got an idea.
MARTY
What?
BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes
widen.
MARTY
You wouldn't.
BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.
MARTY
You would.
JANE
She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing
under a tree. There's more applause from the tent.
BRADY (teasing voice)
Jane... Jane...
She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost
touching her upturned face.
JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over
her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a
nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose
shredded at the knees.
THE TREE, WITH BRADY
He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing
wildly.
JANE
She gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's
near tears.
MARTY, AT ONE SIDE OF THE TREE, FAIRLY TIGHT
The shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part
of this little stunt, as he ought to be.
MARTY
It was just a blacksnake, Jane-
JANE
She looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and
something very close to hate.
JANE
Look at my knees! Look at my dress!
I hate you!
BRADY, UP IN THE TREE
BRADY
Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her
teddies?
MARTY
MARTY
Stop it, Brady.
BRADY, UP IN THE TREE
He throws the snake.
JANE
She dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginning
to cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same.
BRADY, IN THE TREE
BRADY
Ooooh, naughty!
MARTY
He moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural
in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for
the time being we must be puzzled.
MARTY
Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We
didn't mean-
He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.
JANE
Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you,
you booger!
She runs away.
THE TREE, WITH BRADY
He swings down and comes over to MARTY.
BRADY (with satisfaction)
Really got her goat that time.
MARTY
He's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE.
MARTY
Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.
NEAR THE BANDSTAND, FEATURING JANE
DAY
She's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now she
steps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt
of her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose.
STELLA RANDOLPH (voice)
Wait! Don't go!
Startled, JANE looks around, instinctively yanking her dress
down. No one in sight.
MAN (voice; rough)
Just leave me alone!
Now she looks toward:
THE BANDSTAND, JANE'S POV
A man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who
has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about
the farmer's daughter comes striding down from the
bandstand.
STELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to
the stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying -
but these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara
Falls.
STELLA (calls)
Please! You have to help me!
THE GAY DECEIVER
DECEIVER (keeps walking)
It's your oven, but it ain't my bun
you're baking in there. Sorry, babe.
B.g. SOUNDS: More applause.
JANE
We can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the
bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand.
JANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in
this sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the
stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose
absently in a litter can.
JANE mounts the steps timidly.
JANE
Stella? Is that you?
ON THE BANDSTAND
STELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is
bawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she
is both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the
sound of JANE's voice.
STELLA (alarmed)
Who - ?
JANE (approaching closer)
It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.
STELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping.
JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she
approaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly.
JANE (tenderly)
What's wrong?
STELLA (weeping)
He's going away. I know he is.
JANE
Who's going away?
STELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted.
STELLA
What am I going to tell my mother? If
he won't marry me, what am I going to
tell my mother?
JANE (bewildered)
Stella, I don't know what-
STELLA
Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me
alone, you stupid thing!
STELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE
stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little
frightened.
THE PICNIC AREA
People are coming out and getting ready to chow-down.
THE COSLAW STATION WAGON
DAY
Traveling along a country road. Headed home.
THE GS&WM RAILROAD TRACKS (STATION WAGON'S POV)
THE COSLAW HOUSE
NIGHT
JANE is lying in bed, her face to the wall. Dim light falls
on her unhappy face as the door is opened.
MARTY (v-o)
Janey?... Are you awake?
JANE says nothing.
TARKER'S MILLS, UNDER THE MOON
NIGHT
We're looking down at a brave little nestle of lights.
SOUND: A HOWL.
A HOUSE SOME DISTANCE OUT IN THE COUNTRY
There's one light on upstairs and another downstairs... also
downstairs is the bluish flicker of TV light.
An ivy trellis climbs one side of the house.
SOUNDS: Canned laughter; TV dialogue.
THE IVY TRELLIS
NIGHT
Claw-hands are seizing it and climbing. SOUNDS of hoarse,
guttural breathing.
STELLA'S WINDOW, EXTREME UP-ANGLE
The werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal.
SOUND: A TRIUMPHANT HOWL.
TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE
MORNING
a.) MR. PELTZER puts out his paper rack - just the
"Press-Herald" this morning. He looks shocked and grim. The
scare headline: BRUTAL MURDER ROCKS WESTERN MAINE. We can
see STELLA'S photograph.
b.) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see
the proprietor, BOBBY ROBERTSON, talking earnestly with a
bunch of men. Among them: MILT STURMFULLER, ALFIE KNOPFLER,
VIRGIL CUTTS, BILLY McCLAREN, and ELMER ZINNEMAN, a farmer
we'll meet later.
c.) At Andy's Sporting Goods, ANDY FAIRTON is putting a big
hand-lettered sign in the window. It reads: REMINGTON
SHOTGUNS SINGLE ACTION DOUBLE ACTION PUMP PROTECT YOURSELF
AND YOUR FAMILY!
d.) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out
and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she approaches the
parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces her.
A SMALL BRICK BUILDING ON MAIN STREET
The sign reads: TARKER'S MILLS TOWN OFFICE.
TARKER'S MILLS CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL
AFTERNOON
It's a comfortable red-brick building on a side street. Ivy
climbs up the sides. Two or three rows of bikes stand along
one side of the building.
SOUND: The bell rings.
A beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids
spill out. It's the end of the first day of school, and they
are excited. They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8. Most kids
book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes
and riding or just running.
Everyone has a pink report card.
A BUNCH OF KIDS, WITH BRADY KINCAID AND TAMMY
STURMFULLER
BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of
a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver
Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie.
Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing
car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with
a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright
metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing.
Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have
thought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER
BULLET.
BRADY
Look out! Look out! It's Madman Marty and
the Silver Bullet!
TAMMY laughs.
BRADY
You glad to be back in jail, Marty?
MARTY
Sure - I like school.
TAMMY
You booger.
MARTY
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty
soon I'm going to start checking the
mirror to see if I'm turning green.
BRADY
I gotta split - see ya, Marty... Tammy.
THE CORNER OF MAIN AND WALNUT, A WIDER SHOT
AFTERNOON
TAMMY and MARTY watch as BRADY zooms off toward home on his
bike.
MARTY pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever. He
bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by
side, TAMMY on her bike, MARTY in his wheelchair.
MARTY AND TAMMY FROM THE FAR CURB, REVERSE
He pops up over the curbing with a bounce. He shoves in the
little hand clutch and revs the engine. Va-room!
MARTY
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the
regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
TAMMY
What's that?
MARTY
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime
this summer and we'd soup up the engine...
but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and
he's in the doghouse with my mother.
TAMMY
For getting a divorce?
MARTY
Well... it is his third.
A STREET ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, WITH MARTY AND
TAMMY
The other kids are gone; they are alone. The sidewalk has
ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road.
They look toward:
THE RANDOLPH HOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV
The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the
stenciled words POLICE INVESTIGATION. The yard is filled
with cop cars - HALLER'S constable car, plus a number of
state police vehicles. Uniformed men come and go.
We can see a large black wreath on the door.
MARTY AND TAMMY
TAMMY
Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was
scared to go past her house by myself.
MARTY (matter-of-fact)
Yeah... it is a little scary.
TAMMY
I mean, I saw her. All the time.
TAMMY stops her bike. She's on the verge of tears.
TAMMY
I used to see her every day, and she never
knew what was going to happen to her, and
neither did I! I mean I know how stupid
that sounds, but...
MARTY
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
He gets the Silver Bullet moving again, and she has to pedal
along to catch up.
THE STURMFULLER DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY
They stop at the end.
TAMMY
There's something else scary.
MARTY
What?
TAMMY (points)
That.
OLD GREENHOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV
It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place.
Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many
- have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle
of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a
mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.
MARTY AND TAMMY
She is quite deeply troubled.
TAMMY
I've been hearing noises in there.
MARTY
What kind of noises?
TAMMY
Rattling. Rustling.
MARTY
Rats...
TAMMY
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not
rats and it's not kids. It's-
THE STURMFULLER HOUSE, WITH MILT
Oh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic
for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of
pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap
with the word "Caterpillar" on the front and has a bottle of
beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold
the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching
his crotch.
MILT
Tammy, you get on in here and do some
dishes!
THE GREENHOUSE
Sinister...spooky.
TAMMY (voice)
I've got to go.
MARTY AND TAMMY
MARTY
I'd go out and take a look myself, but I
think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden.
It looks sorta greasy.
She smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth.
MARTY is stunned... but happy.
TAMMY
You would, wouldn't you?
MARTY (Joe Cool)
Sure. No sweat.
TAMMY
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked
since... you know.
MARTY
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises,
tell your father. Okay?
TAMMY
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home,
Marty?
MARTY (Startled)
Jeez!
THE WHEELCHAIR "DASHBOARD," MARTY'S POV
There's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on "E."
MARTY AND TAMMY
MARTY
I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.
MILT (voice)
TAMMY!
TAMMY (calls)
Coming Daddy! (To MARTY) Bye... thanks
again for coming home with me.
She waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors
back onto the street and turns toward town.
TAMMY
She brings her bike to a stop by her father.
MILT
'Bout time. Why you want to hang around
that cripple?
TAMMY
I like him.
MILT
Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare.
Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance
the fucking budget.
Having delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now
scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward
THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared.
THE DESERTED GREENHOUSE, TAMMY'S VIEW
DISSOLVES TO:
MARTY
He's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some
distance away - but at least he's made it back to the
sidewalk again.
MARTY (prayerfully)
Come on, baby-
He looks down at:
THE WHEELCHAIR GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV
Now the needle is lying all the way over on "E."
VIRGIL'S TEXACO
LATE AFTERNOON
MARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug
and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the
island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS
comes over.
VIRGIL
Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!
MARTY
Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts?
VIRGIL
Want me to check the oil?
MARTY
Sure!
VIRGIL
Wipe the windshield an check the driver's
bullshit level?
MARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the
Silver Bullet's small tank.
THE COSLAW HOUSE
NIGHT
Overhead is the moon, three days past the full.
UNCLE AL (voice)
I'll see your Carlton Fiske and raise you
a George Brett... a Dave Kingman... and a
Rod Carew.
THE STURMFULLER HOUSE
NIGHT
We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse.
THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to
pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING...RUSTLING...and low animal GRUNTS.
THE GREENHOUSE
NIGHT
More noises. There is a beat of silence, and then something-
one of those earthen plant pots, I think- falls over and
SHATTERS.
THE GREENHOUSE, CLOSER
A LOW SNARL. Plants shake and shiver. Another crash, LOUDER.
THE GREENHOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG (MILT'S POV)
SOUND of another crash. Plants move.
THE GREENHOUSE, FROM TAMMY'S BEDROOM WINDOW
SOUNDS of SNARLS, GROWLS, GRUNTS.
THE STURMFULLER PLACE, MEDIUM-LONG
DAY
The police cars are now here. There's also a meat wagon. As
we watch, a number of cops- JOE HALLER and PETE SYLVESTER
are among them- approach the wagon. Many are carrying canvas
bags.
THE STURMFULLER YARD, FEATURING PETE SYLVESTER
He drops the blood stained bag he's carrying, runs to the
bushes, and noisily blows his groceries.
TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE #3
DUSK
a.) On Oak Street, MRS. THAYER is hurrying toward home,
obviously spooked. She keeps looking behind herself and
nearly flies up the steps to her house. Then there is the
endless business of fumbling with her keys. Finally she
lurches inside and slams the door.
b.) On Main Street, at the Holy Family rectory, FATHER
O'BANION is closing the shutters...and locking them.
c.) On a residential street, a kid is playing with some
plastic trucks outside of a picket fence. Except for him,
the street is deserted. His mother comes out and hauls him
in.
d.) ANDY FAIRTON, in the sporting-goods store, checks an
automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip. He has a
pugnacious, unpleasant look.
e.) BILLY McCLAREN turns the sign on the door of his barber
shop from OPEN to CLOSED, looks out warily at the street (to
make sure there are no psycho killers out there for trims, I
guess), then leaves and locks the door behind him. THE
CAMERA FOLLOWS him down a couple of store fronts to Owen's,
where he also goes in.
f.) The paper rack in front of Peltzer's Drug/ The
"Press-Herald" headline is a sixteen-pointer: MANIAC CLAIMS
SECOND VICTIM.
MARTY AND BRADY KINCAID
MAGIC HOUR
They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the
b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as
he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.
THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on
Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.
In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR
INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MAN (OR ANIMAL)
WHO KILLED STELLA RANDOLPH AND MILTON STURMFULLER. And, at
the bottom: TARKER'S MILLS CITIZENS' COMMITTEE.
Along comes ANDY FAIRTON. He goes into the pub.
A TREE, WITH BRADY'S SMILE-KITE STUCK IN IT
DUSK
SOUND of panting.
MARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms.
His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply
behind him (like the tail of a kite). He sits on a branch,
untangles the kite and the string, and looks down.
MARTY (calls)
Here it comes!
THE FOOT OF THE TREE, WITH BRADY
BRADY
Drop it!
As the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up.
JANE
Marty Coslaw, you get down out of
that tree!
MARTY, IN THE TREE
He descends, then hangs from the lowest branch.
MARTY
Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?
MARTY AND JANE
JANE (makes no immediate move to do so)
Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo.
MARTY (hanging)
Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad?
JANE
They both are. At me, for not getting you
sooner. I ought to let you fall.
But she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He
pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up.
BRADY, FLYING HIS KITE ON THE COMMON
DUSK
MARTY (voice)
Hey, Brady! You coming?
BRADY (looking into the sky)
In a while!
BRADY could give a shit if MARTY'S in trouble. He just waves
vaguely. He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks
in Marin County might say.
MARTY AND JANE
He's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain.
JANE
Come on, Marty.
She starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and
looks at:
BRADY, ON THE COMMON
DUSK
CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP to the yellow smile-kite in the
bluish-purple sky.
THE TOWN COMMON, LONG
Now it is almost completely dark, and a large reddish summer
moon is rising over the horizon.
SOUND: A LONG, WAVERING WOLF HOWL... LOUD.
THE BANDSTAND
BRADY'S kite, torn in a couple of places, flutters on the
steps leading up to the bandstand. The yellow smile face
grins eerily in the darkness. It is streaked with blood.
THE BANDSTAND
NIGHT
JOE HALLER (low voice)
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with
thee. Blessed art thou among women...
He comes out of the shadows, his drawn gun dangling by his
side. This man has had an extremely bad shock. The legs of
his uniform pants are splashed with blood. He makes it down
two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of BRADY'S
smiling, bloody kite. He looks straight ahead. He looks at
nothing.
HALLER (low)
...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb.
Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for
us sinners now...now...
He looks at the kite, then looks away. He puts a hand over
his face and starts to cry.
THE COMMON, LOOKING BACK TOWARD MAIN STREET
NIGHT
A number of men - not all that were in Owen's but quite a
few of them - are running toward the bandstand. HERB KINCAID
is in the lead, screaming his son's name over and over.
SOUND: A LONG HOWL, now at some distance.
THE BANDSTAND, WITH HALLER AND KINCAID
As HERB KINCAID approaches.
HALLER
Stay off the bandstand, Herb.
HERB
Is it my boy? Is it Brady?
HALLER
Don't go up-
HERB (lunges past him)
Brady! Brady!
Disappears into the dark. HALLER looks down at his lap.
HERB
Br-(CUTS OFF)
The other men arrive, PETE in the lead. HALLER doesn't look
up.
PETE
Joe, is it-
HALLER (not looking up)
Shhh.
PETE
Is it the Kicaid b-
HALLER (not looking up)
Shhh, I said.
The men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON
shoves forward.
ANDY
What the fuck is going on h-
SOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men
flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness
on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back
further, looking more uneasy than ever.
HERB (voice; laughing)
We'll bury his shoes.
Now HALLER gets up and joins the other men.
HERB (voice; laughing)
That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury
his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan
cigar boxes.
THE BANDSTAND, MEN'S POV
NIGHT
HERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his
son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes.
HERB
We'll bury his shoes because his feet are
still in them and they're the only part of
him that makes sense anymore.
HERB laughs harder.
HERB
It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this
town ever saw!
HERB SCREAMS LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO CLOSE ON
BRADY'S KITE.
THE MOON, CU
SOUND: HERB SCREAMING.
DISSOLVE TO:
HOLY FAMILY CHURCH
DAY
SOUND: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, "Bringing In
The Sheaves."
There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but
there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG.
MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back.
JANE (v-o)
My mother and father- my mother in
particular- did not much care for Uncle
Al...
THE MOURNERS, WITH MARTY
MARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins
to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would
think- and she and MARTY embrace.
UNCLE AL, CU
He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love.
A COUNTRY ROAD
AFTERNOON
UNCLE AL'S sports car passes THE CAMERA. He's taking MARTY
home.
UNCLE AL'S CAR, ON MAIN STREET
It cruises past Owen's Pub. There are cars parked out front,
but there are also lots of pickup trucks.
THE COSLAW HOUSE
LATE AFTERNOON
UNCLE AL'S car turns in and parks.
OWEN'S PUB
Men are streaming out, getting into station wagons and
pickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing
out even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some
high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood
is up.
OUTSIDE OWEN'S
More cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford
"woody" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing
impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and
BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman
named MAGGIE ANDREWS.
OWEN comes out and crosses to the woody.
ANDY
Well, it's about frigging time! They'll
have his hide tacked to somebody's barn
door before we get out there!
They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it
into gear and backs out onto Main Street.
MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLE
We see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of
town.
FATHER LESTER LOWE
He's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in
procession, some honking their horns, others yelling
cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding.
THE FULL MOON, CU
NIGHT
ELMER AND PORTER ZINNEMAN
NIGHT
ELMER is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a
barbed-wire fence. The seat of his pants is badly snagged.
The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can see
ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees.
ELMER
Help me Porter, goddammit!
PORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING
SOUND. ELMER screams.
ELMER
Don't pull me! You want to rip the right
cheek of my ass right off?
PORTER
Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say
you've been half-assed most of your-
ELMER
Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy?
PORTER begins to pick the barbed wire out of ELMER'S pants.
IN THE WOODS, WITH REV. O'BANION AND VIRGIL CUTTS
NIGHT
O'BANION looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that
priest from "The Exorcist" on safari.
SOUND: A HOWL, FAIRLY LOUD
VIRGIL
Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.
O'BANION
Come on. Be careful.
They move slowly ahead, O'BANION still a bit in the lead.
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as the reverend pushes into some
knee-high brush.
SOUND: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY CHOMP.
O'BANION begins to scream and struggle.
VIRGIL
Rev'runt! What is it?
O'BANION (screaming)
My foot! My foot!
VIRGIL lunges to him and looks down.
O'BANION'S FOOT, VIRGIL'S POV
A medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably
catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty
teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle.
O'BANION AND VIRGIL
O'BANION (SCREAMING)
Get it off me! Get it off me!
VIRGIL (flustered)
Sure...okay...
He kneels down.
VIRGIL
He muscles the trap open, a little at a time.
O'BANION
Relaxing.
SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING CLOSE.
VIRGIL
Startled and unnerved by the HOWL, the trap slips out of his
hands and snaps shut on O'BANION'S mangled ankle again.
REVEREND O'BANION
He screams.
THE MOON, CU
It slides behind a cloud.
SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING.
ANDY FAIRTON'S GROUP
ANDY, BILLY McCLAREN, BOBBY ROBERTSON, OWEN KNOPFLER, and
MAGGIE ANDREWS have been joined by two other men- MR.
ASPINALL and EDGAR ROUNDS.
They have drawn close together, listening as the HOWL FADES.
We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has
gone out of the evening.
They are standing on one side of a ravine. The bottom is
filled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of
it. There are woods on the far side.
ANDY (pointing across)
It came from over there.
BOBBY ROBERTSON
As far as I could tell, it could have come
from anywhere.
ANDY
We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the
bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him.
BOBBY
I dunno-
MAGGIE
I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade
in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in
it, Bobby?
ANDY FAIRTON and EDGAR ROUNDS laugh. ASPINALL and BILLY
McCLAREN smile a little.
OWEN (quietly)
Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too.
BOBBY (stoutly)
I ain't scared! Let's go!
ANDY
Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.
ANDY'S GROUP, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE
Reading from right to left: OWEN KNOPFLER (his gun is still
over his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is
holding), BOBBY ROBERTSON, ASPINALL, ANDY FAIRTON, BILLY
McCLAREN, EDGAR ROUNDS and MAGGIE ANDREWS.
They come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready for
anything- at least, they think so.
ANDY'S GROUP, ANGLE SHOT
They reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their
way across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They push
toward the other side. Now they are about halfway.
SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE.
They all stop, scared.
BILLY McCLAREN
Where's it coming from? Other side?
BOBBY
No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't
trust-
ASPINALL
It isn't on either side.
ANDY
What are you-
ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear.
ASPINALL
It's under the fog. It's right in with us.
The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then:
SOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served.
SOUND: A SCREAM.
EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE
He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION,
that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap.
He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He
goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and
then it disappears.
SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING.
ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a
drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone.
THE SKIRMISH LINE
They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in
the ranks where EDGAR was.
BOBBY ROBERTSON, CU
BOBBY (moaning)
I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move!
THE SKIRMISH LINE IN THE RAVINE, A NEW ANGLE
The GROWLING STARTS AGAIN. THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP THE
LINE. The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath.
ASPINALL, CU
ASPINALL (low)
I think we better start backing up, Andy.
Real slow. Real-
The LOW GROWL rises to a snarl. And from below the mist,
snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ASPINALL'S
voice:
WEREWOLF (voice)
"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"
SOUND: CHOMP!
ASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist.
There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face
is gone.
WEREWOLF (voice)
"Real slow! Real slow!"
A hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks ASPINALL down.
ANDY'S GROUP
They panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one
side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other.
OWEN, WEREWOLF'S POV
THE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like
being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud.
WEREWOLF (voice; laughing)
"Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"
OWEN KNOPFLER
He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He
whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat.
OWEN
Come on, then! You want to rock and roll
with me?
THE GROUND MIST, OWEN'S POV
For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises
out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with
gore.
WEREWOLF
"REEEEEL SLOW!"
MAGGIE AND ANDY
MAGGIE (shrieking)
Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing!
ANDY (groaning with fear)
I don't want to look at it.
He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at:
OWEN AND THE WEREWOLF
The WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with
the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and
slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger.
OWEN
Come on, come on! You want to do the bop?
I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on!
The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist.
Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his
hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The
peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down.
Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN
shrieks.
OWEN (voice)
Come on, you bastard!
The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands
holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends.
Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM
from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the
WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat.
THE RAVINE
THE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE as the WEREWOLF moves below, escaping
down the draw.
Pause. SOUND, IN THE B.G.- low but slowly getting louder: a
congregation singing "Bringing In the Sheaves" to the
accompaniment of a pipe organ.
WEREWOLF (sing-songy voice)
Bringing in the sheaves... bringing in the
sheaves... we shall come rejoicing... bringing
in the sheaves...
THE WEREWOLF FADES OUT; human voices singing the same hymn
overwhelm it and we
DISSOLVE TO:
MAIN STREET
DAY
An old sedan cruises slowly down the street. ANNE and TAMMY
STURMFULLER are in the front seat. It's piled high with
possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff
in it.
HALLER AND PETE
HALLER (indifferently)
Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl.
PETE
Yeah... but what are they doing?
HALLER
Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker
cap, I deduce that they are leaving.
THE STURMFULLER CAR, THE COPS' POV
DAY
They are headed out of town all right, but the thing which
perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place
is now. Main Street looks like a ghost town.
HALLER
She's not the only one. Lot of people
leaving town. And I guess if we want a
beer, we'll have to drink it at home.
He nods toward:
OWEN'S PUB, LONG (PETE AND HALLER'S POV)
A CLOSED sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black
wreath.
HALLER AND PETE
PETE
Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't
never seen you like this.
HALLER (thoughtful)
I lost my guts.
PETE (startled)
Bullshit.
HALLER
It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him...
and I felt it happen. It was no big deal.
No worse than pissing down your own leg.
You ever do that? Maybe when you were
real scared?
PETE, distressed, does not respond.
HALLER
One minute I had me some guts- as much as
the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone.
PETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror.
PETE
Joe... you are going to feel better than
this. This... this feeling of yours...
it's gonna pass...
JOE
Is it?
He walks away, back toward the Municipal Building (the sign
out front reminds folks to SUPPORT THE MEDCU VAN!) while
PETE looks after him, very deeply troubled.
A FAIRGROUND
DAY
It's deserted. Rides stand still. The midway is deserted.
THE CAMERA PANS slowly to a sign which reads TARKER'S MILLS
FAIRGROUNDS GALA FAIR OCTOBER 1 FIREWORKS AT DUSK 10c ON
EVERY DOLLAR GOES TO THE MEDCU VAN FUND!
A cheerful enough sign, except for the strip of paper glued
diagonally across it: FIREWORKS CANCELED.
MARTY (voice)
It's not fair.
ANGLE ON THE COSLAW GARAGE
DAY
UNCLE AL'S sports car is parked in the driveway. We hear the
CLANG of a wrench on the cement inside.
UNCLE AL, AT THE SIDE OF THE COSLAW HOUSE
DAY
He peeks into the backyard.
THE BACK YARD, UNCLE AL'S POV
BOB and NAN are fussing over the barbecue. JANE is hitting a
badminton birdie.
THE ROAD IN FRONT OF COSLAWS', WITH MARTY
MARTY is sitting in the Silver Bullet.
UNCLE AL comes hurrying back from his look-see.
UNCLE AL
All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.
MARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the
tone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a
poppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a
hood's street rod idling at a traffic light.
MARTY looks startled.
UNCLE AL (grinning)
Gun it.
MARTY guns it. The engine roars.
UNCLE AL
Jesus! Not too much!
MARTY (awed)
Wow.
UNCLE AL
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
MARTY
Do I need one?
UNCLE AL
We're gonna find out. Take it down the
road a ways and back. Be careful.
MARTY puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away.
MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
CAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but
he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving
along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the
hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying
this.
UNCLE AL, WATCHING
He drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY.
MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
He slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM!
VRROOM!
THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU
A lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle
engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates.
SOUND: VAROOOOOOOM!
MARTY, CU
Grinning. Looking at:
THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV
It's about a quarter of a mile away.
He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver
Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts
back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that
of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a
motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on
his face.
THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG
Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke
jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the
seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's
laughing like a lunatic.
UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS
UNCLE AL (to himself)
The kid's dead meat. What have I done?
(shouts)
Put a rock in it, Marty!
MARTY IN THE BULLET
He uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing
rubber.
MARTY AND UNCLE AL
The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near
UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns
the engine once and then lets it idle.
UNCLE AL
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm
dying. I hope you're happy, because you
are looking at a dying man.
MARTY
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother
finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have
a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna
Boys' Choir.
MARTY
I don't get you.
UNCLE AL
I know you don't. But I want this to be our
secret. You get that, don't you?
MARTY
Sure.
UNCLE AL
Good.
THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON
The last bit of daylight is just filtering away.
THE COSLAW BACKYARD
The barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs
on the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the
f.g.
UNCLE AL
I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time.
He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him.
NAN
So have I, actually... I wish it could always
be like this.
UNCLE AL
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure
I stay out of trouble at least that long.
MARTY
Okay.
He and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them
with troubled love.
THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL
UNCLE AL
Now I said I had something for you, as
I believe you will recall.
MARTY
Yeah! What is it?
AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper
shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens
the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches
in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers,
Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.
An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he
inventories these goodies.
UNCLE AL
You're gonna have the Fourth of July in
October, Marty. Just don't blow your head
off. (Pause) And remember that it isn't
just the fireworks. It's because no crazy
shithead should be able to stop the good
guys, if you can dig that.
MARTY (respectfully)
I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!
UNCLE AL
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake-
someone's killing people. I have to be out of
my mind to be doing this, you know.
MARTY
Yeah, I know. It's great!
UNCLE AL
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that
you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't
set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay?
Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
MARTY
Yeah... sure.
UNCLE AL
Save this one for last.
He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A
fat fuse sticks out behind the head.
MARTY
What is it?
UNCLE AL
A tracer. You'll like it.
MARTY
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
UNCLE AL
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em
in the bushes for now.
MARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a
line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets
in his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back.
UNCLE AL (grinning)
Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out
for the werewolves!
He leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.
THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE
NIGHT
There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now
the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the
downspout and begins working his way down. This should not
be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong
MARTY'S arms are.
His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he
reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple
under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the
back porch.
MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a
tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and
gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the
porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he
looks up at:
AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW, MARTY'S POV
NIGHT
Still a light on up there.
MARTY, IN THE BULLET
MARTY (whispers)
Shit!
Thinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward:
THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE
MARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of
exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of
silence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes
and gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and
starts moving again.
THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD
The driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily
out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly
along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We
can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns
back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's
not going to be deprived of his treat.
MARTY
He decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the
starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some
more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary
choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It
cranks, but doesn't start.
MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries
again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few
times, it starts.
MARTY (softly)
All right!
He puts it in gear and starts off.
THE ROAD, WITH MARTY, EXTREMELY LONG
What we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along
a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars.
DISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine.
A ROADSIDE TURNOUT
NIGHT
SOUND: Fast-rushing water.
The turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees with
picnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign in
the extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGER
FALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at the
bottom.
SOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching.
MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He
stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of
fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time
selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole
cellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a
twizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top
and lights the fuse.
When it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air.
MARTY (soft)
Here's one for the good guys!
THE TWIZZER
It flies in an arc over the drop.
THE TWIZZER, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT
THE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge of
the waterfall's catch pool.
SOUND: Growling.
THE CREEK, WITH THE WEREWOLF
It has been drinking from the creek. It looks more than half
human now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, but
its face is in shadow.
It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs.
THE TWIZZER, ON THE ROCKS
It's guttering out. A hand-paw touches it and draws back
quickly.
SOUND: Hurt, angry growl.
MARTY, IN THE REST AREA
He's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses
and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the
waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it
on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.
The fountain bursts into a shower of light.
MARTY (delighted)
All right!
THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG
The waterfall is in the b.g.
The WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope.
THE FOUNTAIN, CU
It goes out.
MARTY
He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle.
He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The
Roman candle shoots into the sky.
THE ROMAN CANDLE
Bursts into colored light.
THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG
It GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in the
sky.
MARTY
He's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in
the other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall.
MARTY
Is someone there?
THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT
It freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY.
MARTY
With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and
sets it on the ground, as before.
THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT
Claw-hands settle over the top.
THE FOUNTAIN, CU
It throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die
down.
MARTY
He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice
when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH.
THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF
It's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it
aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree.
Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as
easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a
Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and
advances, hunched over on two legs.
MARTY
MARTY (terrified)
Who's there?
THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV
The grove is a darkened shadowland.
MARTY
He punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and
cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire,
alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with
terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard.
THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV
Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in.
MARTY
Working that starter for all it's worth... but the motor
only cranks. Still no start.
CLAWED, FURRY FEET
MARTY
He gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table
where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the
matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly
drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them.
THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV
We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much
closer.
MARTY
He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same
time.
He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He
puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries
again.
THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS
He strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken.
MARTY (voice; moaning)
Oh, please...
WEREWOLF CLAWS, OPENING AND CLOSING
MARTY
He is in an extremity of terror.
THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS, CU
He pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it. It
lights.
THE WEREWOLF
It recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vague
shadow.
(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is
not a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumption
that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness,
toothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial change
at about the second quarter. It's a process like the tide
coming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at this
point, I think we would recognize him.)
MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to
the fuse. It splutters alight.
MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF, A WIDER SHOT
The WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracer
flares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving a
pink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies at
the WEREWOLF's head.
THE WEREWOLF
The tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of
fire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away.
MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
He punches the starter again. The motor cranks.
THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET
The motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the
fancy carb... and the engine starts to run.
THE WEREWOLF
It's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of the
tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in
fact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branches
out of its way.
MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET
He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping
and weeping with fear.
THE WEREWOLF, IN THE GROVE
It's blundering through the trees. It pulls the tube from
its face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it.
THE TRACER, CU
It lies smoldering on the ground. The end is slick with
blood.
THE ROAD, WITH MARTY
The Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out of
breath, still deeply frightened.
THE WOODS, WITH THE WEREWOLF
We see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubbles
through its fingers.
WEREWOLF (snarling voice)
Bastard Marty! Bastard Marty! Kill you!
Reeeal slow!
COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY
He powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps he
has enough speed to cut the engine and coast.
THE COSLAW HOUSE, VERY EARLY MORNING
SOUND: RINGING TELEPHONE (FILTER)
THE BACK PORCH, WITH MARTY
He's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard.
JANE comes out.
JANE
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting
here all morning.
MARTY
Where's Mom?
JANE
Went shopping. Why?
MARTY
Jane, I have to talk to you.
JANE (mistrustfully)
About what?
MARTY looks at her earnestly.
MARTY
I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't
believe me, and if you won't help me, I...
I...
MARTY has to stop. He's almost crying.
JANE (concerned)
Marty, what is it?
MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANE
JANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of
beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading
MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the
Medcu unit.
JANE (voice-over)
He told me something that was clearly
unbelievable... and yet, somehow I
believed most of it. And I understood
one thing with total clarity: Marty
himself believed it all.
She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the
door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell.
THE PORCH, WITH JANE, A CLOSER SHOT
A sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and
a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear
bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being
unlocked. The lady is taking no chances.
MRS. THAYER
Jane?
JANE (politely)
I'm collecting returnable bottles and
cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer-
I just wondered if you had any.
Her husband comes up the hall.
MR. THAYER
Who is it?
MRS. THAYER
Jane Coslaw.
JANE
What we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring.
JANE
Hi, Mr. Thayer.
THE PORCH, WITH JANE AND MRS. THAYER
MRS. THAYER
Bring your cart around to the back, Jane-
we'll look in the garage.
JANE
Thank you.
She starts down the steps and we
DISSOLVE TO:
JANE, ON MAIN STREET
DAY
Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing
her cart. Even more bottles in it now.
JANE (voice-over)
Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al
was thirty-five that summer and I was
fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe
the unbelievable, although even then that
ability is growing rusty, is preparing to
squeal to a stop.
She is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out
front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back
to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around
collar hangs informally on a bush.
JANE (calls)
Hi, Father Lowe!
LOWE (without turning)
Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw!
JANE
I'm going to bring in a monster load
of bottles in an hour or so!
LOWE (still digging)
That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting.
JANE, FARTHER DOWN MAIN STREET
She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart
outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we
see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while
a few men seated at the counter listen.
OUTSIDE ROBERTSON'S, WITH JANE
She grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down
Main Street. She goes into the barber shop.
JANE (v-o)
Marty had seen where the tracer had
struck home, he said, and I went out
that day doing more than just looking
for returnable cans and bottles- I was
looking for a man- or woman- with only
one eye.
JANE, AT THE RECTORY
She pushes the shopping cart up to the gate, opens it, and
goes up the walk to the foot of LOWE'S porch steps. She
leaves it there and climbs to the porch.
JANE, ON THE PORCH
The screen door is shut, the inner wooden door open.
JANE, ON THE PORCH
She knocks on the screen door.
JANE
Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my
bottles and cans!
JANE, ON THE PORCH
JANE
Okay!
JANE, A WIDER SHOT
She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around
the house.
JANE, LOWE'S POV
She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage
and utility shed at the back.
JANE, AT THE SHED-GARAGE
She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside.
THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY
JANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand-
her tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She
knocks again. Waits. No answer. She tries the door. It
opens.
JANE
Father Lowe?
No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters
the kitchen.
THE COSLAW BACKYARD, WITH MARTY
His eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair.
MARTY (almost moaning)
Oh, Jeez! What did you do then?
JANE AND MARTY
She's changed into shorts and a blouse.
JANE
I ran faster than I ever ran in my life-
what do you think, dummox? By the time I
got back here, I really thought I was
going to faint. (Pause) What are we going
to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody-
grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are
we going to do?
MARTY (thoughtfully)
I think I know.
JANE, ON MAIN STREET
She has the letter in her hand. She approaches the mailbox,
opens the mailbox door, and then glances at the envelope
again.
THE ENVELOPE, JANE'S POV
Addressed in pencil, it says: FATHER LESTER LOWE/HOLY FAMILY
RECTORY; 149 MAIN STREET/TARKER'S MILLS, MAINE.
JANE, AT THE MAILBOX
She drops the letter in with the air of a girl lighting the
fuse on a packet of high explosives. She turns away toward
home.
JANE, AT THE MAIN STREET MAILBOX
She drops in another letter and walks away.
JANE (v-o)
I mailed another letter for Marty the
next day... a third the day after that.
Then, on Saturday...
THE TARKER'S MILLS COMMON, LONG
Parked at the curb is UNCLE AL'S sports car.
JANE (v-o)
...we told Uncle Al what we'd been up to.
(Pause) His reaction was less than serene.
UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY, ON THE COMMON
UNCLE AL
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
JANE
Uncle Al-
UNCLE AL (to JANE)
From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think
his common sense got paralyzed along with
his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little
Polly Practical!
JANE (quiet)
You don't understand.
UNCLE AL (wildly)
Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that
my niece and nephew are sending the local
Catholic priest little love notes suggesting
that he gargle with a broken light bulb or
eat a rat-poison omelet!
MARTY
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's
wearing an eye-patch!
UNCLE AL
I called Peltzer on my way over here,
Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore
two days ago for a bottle of otic solution.
That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's
got a corneal inflammation.
MARTY
Was it a prescription?
UNCLE AL
What the hell does that matter?
MARTY
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because
to get a prescription he'd have to see a
doctor.
UNCLE AL
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
MARTY
Well... was it a prescription?
UNCLE AL
I don't know. But I know you didn't see
any werewolf the other night, Marty. You
had a dream, that's all. An extremely
realistic nightmare brought on by what's
been happening in this town.
MARTY
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in
his shed? You know who used to have a
baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He
was so proud of it he used to carry it in
the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it
looked like the Green Giant used it for
a toothpick!
UNCLE AL
You want to know what I think?
MARTY
No- we just got you out here so we could
admire your pretty face.
UNCLE AL
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a
hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or
something.
JANE (indignant)
It was not! You want me to show you! Come
on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now!
UNCLE AL
No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for
palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic
Werewolf.
JANE stamps her foot, furious with UNCLE AL.
MARTY
Never mind, Jane. He'll have gotten rid of
it by now anyway.
OUTSIDE OF ROBERTSON'S LUNCHEONETTE
The Silver Bullet stands outside. The door opens and UNCLE
AL, JANE, and MARTY come out. UNCLE AL is carrying MARTY
piggyback. MARTY has an ice cream cone. JANE is holding two.
UNCLE AL squats, depositing MARTY in the Bullet. MARTY
starts the engine as JANE hands UNCLE AL his ice cream cone.
The three of them start up the street and THE CAMERA TRACKS
THEM.
JANE
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb,
why hasn't he picked up the telephone and
called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's
sending poison-pen letters?
UNCLE AL
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his
letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept
the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw
Marty in his wheelchair.
JANE
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told
Constable Haller that someone is sending
him poison-pen letters?
UNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward:
THE CATHOLIC RECTORY, LONG - UNCLE AL'S POV
LESTER LOWE is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all.
MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE
UNCLE AL (a bit perplexed)
Well... he probably did. I mean, he could
make a complaint without taking an ad out
in the paper, couldn't he?
MARTY
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff
was nonprescription. And I'll bet you
another quarter he hasn't said anything
to Mr. Haller.
UNCLE AL
Marty, do you see your suspect?
THE RECTORY LAWN, WITH LESTER LOWE
Keeps on moving. MR. ASPINALL drives by and waves. LOWE
waves back.
MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE
MARTY (grim)
Yes, I see him.
UNCLE AL
Do you really think that a man who took
a rocket in the eye three nights ago
could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either
be in the hospital... or dead.
MARTY
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot
him when he was-
UNCLE AL
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus.
Jane, you don't really believe this madness,
do you?
JANE
I don't know exactly what I believe. But I
know that what I saw was a baseball bat and
not a broomstick. I know there was something
strange about the way the house smelled that
day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I
believe in Marty. I mean- there are times
when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but
I still believe in him. (Pause) You used to
believe in him, too, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he
throws his hands up in disgust.
UNCLE AL
Kids!
He walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE.
She walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to
catch up.
A FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN
DAY
It's midafternoon. A bunch of kids are playing baseball. In
the extreme f.g. we see one small boy- MARTY- sitting back
to us in his wheelchair, watching.
AN OLD COUPE
It draws slowly along a tree-lined lane and stops. LESTER
LOWE is behind the wheel.
SOUNDS OF THE BASEBALL GAME CONTINUE.
THE BASEBALL FIELD, AND MARTY, LOWE'S POV
THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON MARTY'S BACK.
LESTER LOWE
LOWE (quietly)
Little bastard.
A FLY BALL
THE FIELD, A WIDER SHOT
The field team heads in. Kids start streaming back toward
town.
MARTY
The OUTFIELDER who caught the fly trots past, and glances
his way.
OUTFIELDER
You comin' down to Robertson's for a
soda, Marty?
MARTY
No- I guess I'll go home.
I think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression
in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't.
OUTFIELDER
Okay- seeya!
MARTY
Yeah... seeya.
He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone.
LOWE'S COUPE
He starts it up.
MARTY, LOWE'S POV
He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the
other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone.
LOWE'S COUPE
It turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the
road.
MARTY'S WHEELCHAIR, LOWE'S POV
MARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer
to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it.
MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
He's daydreaming his way along- maybe, inside his head, he's
playing center field for the Dodgers.
SOUND: Winding roar of a car engine. MARTY turns around.
LOWE'S COUPE, MARTY'S POV, ROARING AT THE CAMERA
MARTY AND LOWE'S COUPE
MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across
the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way
by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet.
LOWE'S coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into
the ditch.
THE COUPE'S REAR WHEELS
Spinning helplessly in the dirt.
MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
He speeds past the coupe, and thumbs his nose.
THE COUPE
It roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto
the road. Then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing
Silver Bullet.
THE SILVER BULLET, WITH MARTY
He hears the GROWLING SOUND of LESTER LOWE'S coupe. He looks
behind.
THE COUPE
Roars toward THE CAMERA.
MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds.
CHASE MONTAGE
The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple:
LOWE is chasing MARTY's hopped-up wheelchair along a country
road at speeds approaching fifty MPH. MARTY should have a
couple of near misses, and perhaps we could actually have
him pass one car. At one point we should have a REVERSE
ANGLE on LESTER LOWE'S coupe, featuring two bumper stickers:
ATTEND AND SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CHURCH and HONK IF YOU LOVE
JESUS!
As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that LOWE is
gaining. MARTY looks increasingly desperate. And now he
looks down at:
THE SILVER BULLET'S GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV
The needle is all the way over on "E."
MARTY
He groans. SOUND of the coupe's engine GROWS LOUDER.
THE COUPE AND THE SILVER BULLET
LOWE charges, rapidly closing the distance. MARTY swerves
from one side of the road to the other, escaping LOWE for
the moment but almost overturning in the process.
They are now running beside a river- the Auger River, in
fact.
THE BULLET'S GAS GAUGE
Now the needle is actually past "E."
MARTY
MARTY
Come on, baby... come on...
His face registers hope as he sees:
ROADSIDE SIGN, MARTY'S POV
AUGER RIVER COVERED BRIDGE 2000 FEET AHEAD AUTOMOBILES
PROHIBITED!
MARTY, IN THE BULLET
He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going
for broke. The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's
motor COUGHS.
THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV
It's pretty ramshackle. A big orange sign beside it reads:
BRIDGE UNSAFE! TRUCKS AND AUTOS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED!
THE SILVER BULLET
MARTY brakes, hits the shoulder of the road, and somehow
makes the turn. We see him holding on for dear life as the
Silver Bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the
mouth of the covered bridge.
LOWE'S COUPE
It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a
halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane.
THE SILVER BULLET
It bounces up the incline to the bridge, MOTOR COUGHING AND
SPLUTTERING.
THE COUPE
It comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop.
THE SIGN PROHIBITING MOTOR TRAFFIC, LOWE'S POV
THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET
It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of
the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine
through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor.
The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair
sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage
is about seventy feet.
About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last
cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along
silently, going on its dying momentum.
THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV
Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under
the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath.
MARTY, REVERSE
Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE
CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair
is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at:
THE LANE LEADING AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV
This is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the
sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when
one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal
maniac close behind.
MARTY, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE
LOWE (soft voice)
Marty...
MARTY'S head whips around.
THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV
We see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S
silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of
footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge.
MARTY
He's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he
wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet.
LOWE, MARTY'S POV
He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not
hurrying.
LOWE
You're going to have a terrible accident,
Marty. You're going to fall into the river.
SOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger.
MARTY
TRACTOR SOUND IS LOUDER.
MARTY'S face fills with hope. He looks from LOWE toward:
THE LANE, MARTY'S POV
THE TRACTOR SOUND gets louder still, and here comes ELMER
ZINNEMAN on a John Deere. The tractor is hauling a manure
spreader which is mostly empty.
MARTY
MARTY (waving madly)
Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman!
ELMER AND MARTY
ELMER draws the tractor up close to MARTY and swings it
around. MARTY looks back at:
MARTY AND ELMER
MARTY looks back at ELMER.
MARTY
I ran out of gas.
ELMER
Spooky in there, ennit?
MARTY (with feeling)
It sure is!
He looks back once more toward:
THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV
Brooding, shadowy. CAMERA HOLDS AND WE
DISSOLVE TO:
THE COSLAW BACKYARD
DAY
MARTY is talking to UNCLE AL. JANE is behind them, knocking
croquet balls through the wickets on the back lawn.
MARTY is looking at his Uncle anxiously as JANE strolls
over.
UNCLE AL
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow
without the hair and the foaming jaws.
Also, I checked on the otic solution.
It was counter brand. No prescription
needed.
MARTY
I told you!
UNCLE AL
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
JANE (sits down)
Did you talk to the constable?
UNCLE AL
After Marty called me with his latest
Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. (Pause)
He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged
at all.
MARTY
I told you!
JANE
Shut up, Marty.
UNCLE AL (reluctantly)
There's something else.
MARTY					JANE
What is it?					What other thing?
UNCLE AL
I probably shouldn't tell you- you're
both hysterical on the subject. I'm
starting to feel like a guy handing
out free Arthur Murray coupons to
victims of the dancing sickness.
MARTY
Uncle Al, if you don't tell me-
He makes strangling gestures.
UNCLE AL (reluctant)
I went out to that rest area.
MARTY (triumph)
You found the tracer?
UNCLE AL
No... but I found some blood, smeared on
a tree trunk in that grove.
MARTY
There! You see!
UNCLE AL
It could have been anything, Marty.
MARTY
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his
car and trying to run me down? You don't
think that was a dream, do you?
UNCLE AL
No.
UNCLE AL comes over to JANE'S side of the Silver Bullet. He
looks down at:
THE FRAME OF THE BULLET
There's a scrape and a dent where LOWE'S coupe dented it.
There is also a fleck of paint.
UNCLE AL AND JANE, CU
UNCLE AL
Lowe's car-?
JANE
Blue. This blue.
UNCLE AL
Jesus.
THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON
Three-quarters full.
THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the Tarker's Mills town hall. UNCLE
AL'S sports car is parked out front.
THE RECTORY
NIGHT
A Chevrolet with TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABLE painted on the
side in gold leaf pulls up. JOE HALLER gets out, and as he
does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over
his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's
shoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, remember
them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the
picture. He goes up the walk.
HALLER rings the doorbell.
No one comes. HALLER rings the bell again. Waits. No one
comes. He leans down and looks through a side window.
HALLER
He goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and
then goes over to the shed-garage. He opens the door and
looks in.
THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV
LOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the
shadowy piles of bottles and cans.
THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE
DAY
UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today.
The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees.
MARTY
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and
guess what? No one sees him again!
UNCLE AL
And what do you suggest I do about it,
dear boy?
MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it
to UNCLE AL.
MARTY
I want you to turn this into a silver
bullet.
UNCLE AL
You're not going to let it go, are you?
MARTY
I saw what I saw.
UNCLE AL
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
JANE (quietly)
In the made-up stories, the guy who's the
werewolf only changes when the moon is full.
But maybe he's really that way almost all
the time, only as the moon gets fuller...
MARTY (finishes)
...the guy gets wolfier.
JANE (hands AL her crucifix)
Here. Take mine, too.
MARTY
Jane... you don't have to do that.
JANE
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I
don't, booger-brains.
MARTY
Will you marry me, Jane?
UNCLE AL
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy
Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
JANE
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
MARTY
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or
exactly what it is- but people still
believe in it.
UNCLE AL
The kid is eleven years old and already
he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
MARTY
I think he's going to come for me. Not
just because I know who he is, but
because I hurt him. Only I don't think
he'll try again as Lowe.
UNCLE AL
Dear boy, you have gone right out of
your mind.
MARTY
Will you do it?
UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure.
A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH THE COSLAW STATION WAGON
DAY
UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the
wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short
lane and into a gravel pit.
THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can
see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's
bloody and chewed.
THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY
DAY
The wagon pulls in.
SILVER BULLET MONTAGE
a.) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a sign
reading MAC'S GUNS AND AMMO. He takes out the St.
Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if
still ruing his own credulity and stupidity. He goes inside.
JANE (voice-over)
Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a
gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an
old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard
of weapons.
b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to
MAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a
kind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper
skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All
Hallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly,
using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale
is, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands
the medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver
chains over his fingers and looks at them.
JANE (v-o continues)
God knows what sort of story my uncle
told him, but I think that for men who
have been married as often as Uncle Al,
invention on short notice becomes
something of a specialty.
c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the
medal and looking closely at the stain.
JANE (v-o continues)
The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade
silver content of my crucifix and Marty's
medallion...
d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer
than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin
melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'S
melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.
JANE (v-o continues)
...melted them down...
e.) We see MAC pouring molten silver into a bullet mold.
JANE (v-o concludes)
...and molded them into a silver bullet.
THE FULL MOON, CLOSE
NIGHT
It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the
warm summer air.
JANE (voice-over)
By the time Marty's silver bullet was done,
it was Halloween... and the full moon had
come around again. Earlier that afternoon,
my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer
for over seven years, finally finished the job.
THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the COSLAW house. There's a carved
jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door.
UNCLE AL'S MG is in the driveway. The COSLAW station wagon
is just backing out. UNCLE AL and JANE stand in the doorway;
MARTY is slightly behind them in the Silver Bullet.
NAN leans out of the car. She's wearing black, and she has
obviously been crying.
NAN
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton
in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral
parlor. It's Stickney and-
UNCLE AL
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
The station wagon backs farther and NAN leans out again.
NAN
And don't open the door for any trick or
treaters even if they come!
UNCLE AL
We won't!
The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops out
again.
NAN
You kids go to bed on time! You've got
school tomorrow!
UNCLE AL
If you keep doing that, you're going to
bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama-
tell her I'll see her Thursday.
NAN
I will- be good, kids.
MARTY							JANE
'Bye, mom! Bye, dad!				We will! 'Bye!
The station wagon accelerates away.
UNCLE AL
Can I tell you kids something?
JANE
Sure, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL
When me and sissy were kids, we were
just like you two.
MARTY
Yeah? Really?
UNCLE AL
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still
are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
He ushers them inside and closes the door.
THE COSLAW HOUSE, FROM ONE SIDE
The WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side
yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of
the house (this is the opposite side from MARTY'S bedroom).
IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF
There is a space in here between the house and the bushes-
it's like an animal's run. The WEREWOLF creeps along this,
its one eye flaring.
DIM SOUND OF TV SNOW.
IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF
It recoils, eyes gleaming. Foam begins to drip from its
jaws. It creeps slowly along toward a window. TV SNOW SOUNDS
GROW LOUDER.
THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, ECU
We see a clawed, hairy hand reach into the frame and close
around a thick wire.
WEREWOLF (voice)
Reeeal slow...
It yanks.
TARKER'S MILLS, LONG
NIGHT
Quiet. Sleeping.
JANE (voice-over)
It wasn't always easy for me to answer
that... but I could answer it that night,
and I find I can say it now that the
terrible events of that fall have receded
to memories which seem little more than
dreams in my mind.
TARKER'S MILLS, LONG
JANE (voice-over; no more than a whisper)
I love you, Marty... good night.
THE CAMERA PANS UP to the full moon.
FADE OUT.
