      FADE IN:

      EXT. HOUSTON, TEXAS - NIGHT

      The forth largest city in the U.S.  Otherwise know as Space
      City... H-Town... The most air-conditioned place on earth.

      FLYING IN from the Gulf of Mexico... the second-largest U.S.
      port... Drug trafficking, hurricanes, 100% humidity... Moving
      up Buffalo Bayou toward the magnificent skyline... Skirting
      past the glimmering lights to Briar Forest, one of the many
      neighborhoods nestled in this sprawling southern metropolis...  

      CHYRON: "A week ago."

      EXT. EDWARDS HOUSE - NIGHT

      An affluent mix of old and new just behind Memorial Park. 
      We ZERO IN on a house as a CAR pulls into the garage... 

      INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - KITCHEN/FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

      MIKE EDWARDS (42) and KATE EDWARDS (40, as of today), full
      of life and optimism, enter their kitchen from the garage, a
      little tipsy, the ease of a successful 15-year marriage--

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    40's the new 30, right?  How bad can
                    it be?

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    No wise man ever wished to be younger.

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                          (thinks)
                    Eleanor Roosevelt?

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Jonathan Swift.  
                          (beat)
                    I think.  We could Google it.

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    Google shmoogle.  Thank you.  For
                    the best birthday ever.

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Looking forward to the next 40...

      They kiss.  Till Kate sees a card on the counter, "Happy
      Birthday, Mom!"  Only a mother's love for her daughter could
      interrupt this moment.  She opens it.  Reads, smiles--

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    Look at the card Kayla left for me.

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Sweet.  She asleep?  I'm gonna turn
                    on the news...

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    I'm gonna sleep off three martinis...

      Kate squeezes Mike's hand and heads upstairs.  Mike flips on
      the news and gets comfortable on the couch...

      INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

      Mike jerks awake-- a gun pointed in his face.  A MAN in a
      ski mask and gloves is staring down his automatic at him-- 

                                    MAN 
                    Hands.

      Mike's eyes go wide.  Taking in the threat.  Trying to process--

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Gimme your hands.

      --Things moving fast and slow at the same time.  Mike leaps,
      trying to get to his family.  The Man cracks him in the head
      with his gun, dazing him.  Puts a plastic zip tie around his
      wrists and drags him upstairs to--

      INT. KAYLA EDWARDS' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      --Where he rouses KAYLA (13) from sleep, the gun in her face--

                                    MAN
                    Gettup.  

                                      KAYLA EDWARDS
                    Daddy--?

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Do what he says.  I love you.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        3.

      CONTINUED:

      The Man zip-ties Kayla's hands, keeping the gun on her. 
      Indicates for them to continue down the hall to the--

      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Where Kate is asleep, stirs when the light flicks on--

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    Babe...?

                                    MIKE EDWARDS
                    Kate--

                                    MAN
                    Up. 

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    Oh my God-- Kayla--

                                      KAYLA EDWARDS
                    Mommy--

                                    MAN
                    Hands.

      Kate sees Mike's and Kayla's bound hands.  Extends her own. 
      The Man ties them--

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Go--

      He pushes Kate into the--

      INT. WALK-IN CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

      The Man in the doorway, and Kate-- 

                                    MAN
                    Open it.

                                    KATE EDWARDS
                    What--?

                                    MAN
                    The safe.  

      Right.  Kate opens a cabinet door.  Inside is a large SAFE. 
      She studies the lock... Please, let me remember... She turns
      the swivel several times.  Wrong.  Back again.  Excruciating. 
      Then.  Click.  She scrambles out of the way to give him room--

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Your ring.

      Her engagement ring.  Kate slips it off.  Tosses it to him.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        4.

      CONTINUED:

      He empties the safe into his backpack and pushes Kate--

      INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      --Back into the bedroom.  Points his gun toward the wall.

                                    MAN
                    Kneel.  

      Kate, Mike and Kayla kneel down facing the wall.  

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Be quiet and everything's gonna be
                    fine... 

      Mike and Kate share a glance, ever hopeful, when--

      BAM.  BAM BAM.  The Man opens fire.  Three shots.  And we:

                                                                      SMASH TO BLACK.

      UNDER WHICH WE HEAR:

        A HEARTBEAT, working overtime.  Like a symphony, other
      instruments join in:  Rapid BREATHING, POUNDING footsteps.

      CLOSE ON THE FACE OF A WOMAN, early thirties.  Running.

      Her name is ANNIE FROST.  And if you're wondering why you're
      instantly drawn to her, it's probably because she's a Texan. 
      Wholesome.  Open.  Lethal-- 

      Cowboy boots pounding the dirt like a machine.  Nothing else
      in the world except whatever she's running from.  Or towards.

      CHYRON: "Today."

      WIDER TO REVEAL A MAN 

      About 50 yards in front of her.  Let's call him "The Bull." 
      Because he's big and mean as a bull, and struggling mightily
      to make the distance between them wider.  Might pull it off
      too, as he merges into the crowd of tourists at--

      EXT. THE SKYWALK GLASS BRIDGE AT GRAND CANYON WEST - DAY

      Annie arrives a step behind, searching FACES for her target. 
      People LAUGHING.  SNAPPING photos.  And below her feet--

        A "U"-SHAPED GLASS BRIDGE extending 70 feet out from the
      canyon rim, 4,000 feet above the canyon floor.  Annie braces
      herself, vertigo kicking in, as she walks out onto the bridge--
      the Bull, nowhere to be seen amongst the CROWD.  

      Annie eyes the bridge's railing.  And something clicks.  She 

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        5.

      CONTINUED:

      scans the crowd.  Spots a BURLY BIKER carrying a MOTORCYCLE
      LOCK/CHAIN over his shoulder.  She flashes her BADGE--

                                      ANNIE
                    U.S. Marshal.  The chain.  Now.

      The biker opens the lock in a hurry, hands it over--

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:

      ANNIE'S TEAM--

      JIMMY GODFREY (late-thirties; gritty but handsome; an East
      Texas kid who never grew up);  

      MARCO MARTINEZ (mid-thirties; loves to talk); and

      DAISY OGBAA (early-thirties; second-generation Nigerian-
      American; a woman of few words)

      --as they secure the highly-trafficked tourist area.  But
      mostly we're focused on--

      ANNIE

      Doing the impossible as she climbs over the glass railing,
      using the motorcycle chain as a sling.  Sucking in air as
      the chain gives-- then grabs-- suspending her mid-air.

      She pulls herself against the infrastructure.  Struggling to
      keep her eyes straight ahead-- 

      Where she spots her man hiding in a support beam.  They
      connect eyes, locking in on each other.  His look, one of
      utter shock.  No fucking way this bitch is still on me.  

      But oh yes, she most certainly is.  

      He shimmies further away from the side of the canyon, Annie
      moving after him-- forcing him to the far end of the bridge. 
      Nowhere to go but up.  And damn if that big boy doesn't drag
      himself all the way back up to the bridge...  

      Annie scrambles along the underside, watching his feet retreat
      along the glass floor above her.  Until he stops.  Pulls out
      his gun and aims it down at Annie through the glass, an easy
      target.  A half-beat from squeezing the trigger when Annie
      draws her own weapon and-- 

      BLAM-- fires first-- the bullet piercing the glass and
      catching the Bull in the leg-- downing him.

      Annie then watches in horror as that section of glass floor
      SPIDER-WEBS-- threatening to give way-- holding just long
      enough for Daisy and Macro to grab the Bull-- 

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        6.

      CONTINUED:

      Then SHATTERS-- raining down on Annie in relentless knives
      of glass.  She blocks her face-- losing her balance--

      AND FALLS

      --Barely grabbing hold of the last beam by one hand, gravity
      fighting her grip.  She GASPS-- not wanting to die-- 

      AND HURLS HERSELF up onto the beam-- pure survival instinct. 
      When a hand reaches down.  It's Jimmy.  He helps her up to
      safety.  Then grins at the destruction, impressed--  

                                      JIMMY
                    Nice job, Boots.  

      A beat as she catches her breath.  Then smiles, a tiny bit
      prideful.  Just enough so we love her even more--  

                                      ANNIE
                    We got him, huh?

                                      JIMMY
                    Got him good.  

                                      ANNIE
                    Alrighty.  Let's get outta here.

      INT. SOUTH TEXAS VIOLENT OFFENDER FUGITIVE TASK FORCE - DAY

      Welcome to the South Texas Violent Offender Fugitive Task
      Force.  Four walls.  One:  A map of Texas, its iconic shape,
      the state known 'round the world.  Two:  The Texas Flag with
      its Lone Star.  Three:  The U.S. Marshals Star badge.  Four: 
      The U.S.M.S. "Top 15 Most Wanted," a.k.a. "The Bitch List,"
      15 wooden frames with the fugitive's mug shot and stats,
      lovingly adorned with horns, fake mustaches, etc.  The room
      itself is filled with low-walled cubicles for the deputies'
      desks.  A few offices off the main room.  Nothing fancy.  

      The Task Force members (including Jimmy, Marco and Daisy)
      start their day with coffee and kolaches (ko-lah'-chee: a
      Czech pastry filled with pretty much anything you want and
      an essential part of any Houston cop's day).  [Note: Unlike
      clean-cut, suit-wearing FBI agents, these deputies are in
      jeans and T-shirts, allowing them to blend in in places where
      fugitives and their associates hang out.]

      They ERUPT WITH APPLAUSE when Annie enters, her signature
      boots and faded Levis-- 

                                      MARCO
                    Hey-- it's the famous Annie Frost! 
                    Looked good on the 10 o'clock news! 



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        7.

      CONTINUED:

                                      DAISY
                    Got a fugitive on Mt. Rushmore, you
                    wanna go wreck that too.

                                      JIMMY
                    Gonna sic you on my ex next time she
                    comes 'round lookin' for alimony.  

      Annie LAUGHS.  This is a crowd that lives to toss each other
      shit.  But Annie can take it.  And they know it.  The more
      shit they toss, the more they show their love for this woman
      who has, in 8 short years, become their de facto leader in
      the field.  Their heart and soul.

                                      ANNIE
                    Which ex we talking about, Jimmy? 
                    Number five or six?

      More LAUGHTER.  Task Force Commander CHIEF TYLER (45, had an
      earring and long hair before they offered him the job) enters. 
      LUKE WATSON (25, clean-cut, fresh-faced) trails a step behind.

                                      CHIEF TYLER
                    Okay, Annie, so you nab the slimeball
                      drug-slinger we've been chasing 5
                    years.  Now you wanna tell us how
                    you destroyed part of a $14 million
                      architectural marvel and nearly got
                    yourself killed in the process?

      The room CHUCKLES.  But there's pride in Tyler's eyes. 
      Annie's the best he's got.  

                                      CHIEF TYLER (CONT'D)
                      Contractor just called Washington. 
                    Glass panel's gonna run us 70K.

                                      JIMMY
                    We got enough in the seized assets
                    fund to cover that one?  

                                      ANNIE
                    Tell 'em to file a claim.  

      More LAUGHTER, till Luke Watson pipes up, in earnest--

                                    LUKE
                    Good thing there were no ricochets. 
                    Could've shot yourself, instead of
                    the Bull.

      Everyone turns and looks.  Who the fuck is this?  Dressed
      D.C. preppy, shiny new loafers for his first day on the job-- 



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        8.

                    He's your tag-along.  Show 'em the
                    ropes, get him acclimated.

      As Tyler turns to go, Annie and Jimmy catch up--

                                      ANNIE
                    Never been one for tag-alongs, Chief. 
                    Except for ol' Jimmy here, of course.

                                      JIMMY
                    Look at the kid.  He'll last as long
                    in Texas as a fly in a frog swamp.

                                      CHIEF TYLER
                    What you get for being the best. 

      Just enough sarcasm to shut them up.  Tyler exits.  Luke
      smiles at the gang--

                    Just wanna tell you how psyched I am
                    to be on the Task Force.  It's been
                    a dream of mine.  Seriously.

      Daisy and Marco share a look.

                    Totally.  The sooner the better.

      Whatever that means, we'll find out later, as Jimmy holds a
      phone out to Annie--

                    Wes Lawson from HPD Homicide.  Says
                    he's got a bad one, needs our help.

      Annie nods, her whole demeanor going serious, as we SMASH TO--

      INT. FUGITIVE TASK FORCE - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

      A MAN'S FACE (26, blond hair, green eyes) illuminated on the
      wall as Annie turns off the lights.  Luke reacts, Huh?, till
      Annie turns on the "smart board" (a wall-sized computer touch
      screen that lets her call up images, save what she writes to
      a file), and pulls up one of her famous "LINK CHARTS" (looks
      like a family tree with the fugitive in the middle, everything
      they know about him branching out).

      INT. MASON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

      Annie looks around the kitchen.  Spotless.  Zeroes in on--

      --THE SINK.  She reaches her hand into the disposal.  Pulls
      out a few mangled Maraschino cherry stems.  

      --THE REFRIGERATOR.  Empty.  She opens the butter dish door. 
      Finds a hot sauce packet from "Tico's Tacos."  Pockets it.

      INT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

      Daisy and Marco talk to Mason's mother.  She's wearing a
      tidy waitress uniform.  There are religious icons around.  

                                    JAN BOYLE
                    I ain't seen Mason since he went
                    away to jail.

                    He hasn't come to you looking for
                    money?  A place to stay?

                    Tried to call me from prison in the
                      beginning.  But I didn't accept the
                    charges, no thank you, ma'am.

                                      MARCO
                    He have brothers or sisters?

                    five good shots.  But every sixth

      INT. MASON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Jimmy and Luke hang on the periphery as Annie talks to Laura. 
      Laura thrusts a PHOTO of herself and Mason at Annie-- 

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    Just look at him.  He ain't the type
                    to kill someone--

                                      ANNIE
                    When's the last time you saw him?

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    Monday morning, when he left for a
                    job.  He does construction, goes
                    outta town sometimes...

                                      ANNIE
                    You know where he likes to drink? 
                    Hang out?  Play pool?  

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    ... Not really.

                                      ANNIE
                    If you lie to me, Laura, makes you
                    an accessory after the fact.

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    We're still gettin' to know each
                    other.  Hasn't been that long, okay?

                                      ANNIE
                    Where'd you meet him?

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    At the Waffle House, when he was
                    back from Mexico.

                                      ANNIE

                    Where he was buildin' houses.  Didn't
                    have a place yet, so I said he could
                    stay.  Let him use my car, too.  

                                      ANNIE
                    Where are his things?  He take
                      everything with him?  

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    He doesn't have much.  Possessions
                    tie you down.

                                      ANNIE
                    ... Is that what he told you?

      Laura looks at Annie.  Doesn't realize she's being baited.

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    He wouldn't lie to me.  Ain't just
                    my boyfriend, he's my fianc .  Asked
                    me to marry him night before he left.

      Annie and Jimmy share a glance.  Laura holds her chin just a
      little bit higher.  Annie looks at Laura's hand--

                                      ANNIE
                    He forget the ring? 

      Laura gives Annie a look.  Proudly fishes a necklace out
      from under her uniform, an engagement ring hanging from it.  

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    He didn't have a chance to get the
                    size right yet.  But it's big.  

      A good two carats.  Annie eyes it... 

                                      ANNIE
                    There was a lot of jewelry stolen
                    from that house...

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    ... What?  No.  Mason bought it for
                    me.  It's mine.

                                      ANNIE
                    If that's true, I'll bring it back.  

      Laura looks at the ring, a lump rising in her throat. 
      Blinking, she hands it to Annie.

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    You know, Laura.  If he lied about

                    ... handsome guy like that.

      Laura stares at Annie, determined not to break down.

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    I'm late for work.  Can I go now?

      EXT. LOW-RENT APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

                    Let's set up on her 'round the clock. 
                    See if she leads us to Mason.

                                    LUKE
                    Or if Mason comes to her...?

                                      ANNIE
                    Oh, no.  Mason's done with her.

      WHOOSH --

      INT. HOUSTON GROCERY STORE - DAY

      A LITTLE GIRL (3) wanders down the aisle of a Houston grocery
      store.  Lost.  A cart, empty except for three jars of
      Maraschino cherries, rolls up to her.

                                      MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Are you lost, sweetheart?

      The little girl looks up at the Man.

                                      LITTLE GIRL 
                    Do you know where my mommy is?

      The Man crouches down.  It's Mason.  He smiles at her. 

                                      MASON
                    Whaddya say we try and find her? 

      He takes her hand-- and walks her straight out of the store...

      EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY

      Rain.  A MOTHER searches frantically for her child.  Mason
      walks up to her with the little girl.

                                      LITTLE GIRL'S MOTHER
                    Oh my God--!  Sophie--!

      She falls on her knees.  Envelops her daughter in her arms. 
      Never gonna let go.  Then looks up at Mason.  Her hero.

                    Thank you. 

      Mason shields his face from the rain.

                    Nice weather we're having.  Lemme
                    help ya to your car.

      The woman smiles and picks up her child.  Mason follows with
      her cart and umbrella, as they reach her station wagon...  

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    Got the keys?

      Mason holds out his hand.  The woman hesitates.  Mason picks
      up on it, gives an embarrassed laugh--

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry.  Here I am, a stranger,
                    askin' for your keys--

                    helping me out and... Here.

      She gives him the keys.  Mason unlocks the station wagon. 
      He opens the glove compartment and finds her registration.  

                                      MASON
                    Ruthven Street.  Nice neighborhood.

                    happens next just don't feel right
                    in front'a the little one.

      Mason smiles.  Then drives away.  PAN FROM the woman and her
      little girl... to an abandoned late-model Honda Accord, a
      "Waitresses Make Better Lovers" bumper sticker on it...

      INT. TICO'S TACOS - DAY

      Jimmy and Luke eat tacos, blending in and keeping an eye out
      as Annie discreetly shows Mason's photo to a BLONDE WAITRESS--

                    I was finally gonna say yes.

      Annie watches a few guys get up after lunch.  They head across
      the street to a door with a sign, "Cartwright Construction." 

                                      ANNIE

      INT. CARTWRIGHT CONSTRUCTION - DAY

        Hole-in-the-wall office, immigrant day-laborers milling. 
      Annie walks in:  Red lipstick, hair up, shirt tied in a knot,
      snapping a piece of gum.  She spots the MANAGER (50s)--

                    Howdy.  Y'all seen my brother, Mason?

                    Sorry.  Dunno 'im.

                    a heap a money to hand 'im and-- I
                    just gotta find 'im.  Okay?

      Annie puts a few bills on the counter.  A long beat as the

                    Dodge Chargers.  Old ones.  Said it
                    was the only car a man should drive.

                    every chance she got to tell me I
                    was just like him, a no-good outlaw. 
                    All I wanted was to earn her love,

                    Hi, Kayla.  I'm Annie Frost, U.S.
                    Marshals.  Hope you like daisies...

      She can't get the words out.  A beat.  She tries again:

                    ... was nice.

      On Annie, as this twisted truth lands.  She turns to go--

                    He's still out there, isn't he?

      Annie stops.  She faces Kayla, who's struggling to hide just

                    and Wilson families, see what they
                    have in common.

                                    LUKE
                    Mason works construction.  Maybe he
                    helped build the houses.  Knows where
                    the safes are.

                                      ANNIE
                    But how does he know what's in them? 
                    Not many people know the contents of
                    your home safe...

                                      JIMMY
                    Lawyer who draws up your will?

                                      ANNIE
                    ... Or the company who insures them.

                                      JIMMY
                    Thinking this is an inside job?

                                      ANNIE
                    Sure seems like it.  Let's find out
                    who insured both safes.  See if
                    there's a connection.

      Daisy joins them from the other side of the room--

                                      DAISY
                    We lost Laura Ross at the Pancake
                    House.

                                      ANNIE
                    What happened?  TFOs said they had a
                    good position--

                                      DAISY
                    Only traffic to the back was a
                    delivery truck.  Laura went into the
                    kitchen when it got there.  When our
                    guys didn't see her for a few minutes
                    they went inside to check and she
                    was gone.  They tracked down the
                    driver and jacked him up.  Says he
                    dropped her off a couple blocks away.

                                      ANNIE
                    ... Can't protect her from herself...

      WHOOSH --                                                                                        27.



      EXT. PALMER'S ICE HOUSE - NIGHT

      Mason exits an "ice house" (a low-rent bar with a garage
      door opening to the outside), a self-satisfied grin on his
      face till he finds Laura Ross waiting for him in the shadows--

                                      MASON
                    Laura?  Hell you doin' here?

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    They're gonna find you pretty easy,
                    you keep comin' to the same places-- 

                                      MASON
                    --Who?  Who's gonna find me?

                                      LAURA ROSS
                          (Annie's CARD--)
                    Sayin' you broke into a house and
                    shot a family. 

                                      MASON
                          (reads it, pockets it--)
                    Marshals?  They find anything?

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    How could they, way you spic'n'spanned
                    the place before you left?  I didn't
                    know it was cause you were never
                    comin' back.

                                      MASON
                    Who told ya that?  Damn feds? 
                    Company's got me shacked up with the
                    rest of the crew near the job site.  

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    I don't get it, Mason.  I thought
                    you wanted to marry me.  You do this
                    just to hurt me?
                          (takes out her necklace--)
                    They even took my ring...

      Mason shakes his head, kicks some gravel... Time to confess:

                                      MASON
                    Those back taxes I told ya about...? 
                    Really it's money I took from a bank. 
                    They're gettin' back at me now. 
                    Tryin' to turn you against me...

      Mason stares at Laura.  Laura stares at Mason.  Finally:

                                      LAURA ROSS
                    You dumb sonovabitch.

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        28.

                    C'mon.  Car's 'round back.  You and
                    me got weddin' bells to talk about...

      He puts his arm around her and leads her into the alley, his
      other hand reaching for the knife in his back pocket...

      INT. BOLLINGER INSURANCE - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

      PAN OFF a "Bollinger Insurance" coffee mug to find Annie and
      Jimmy talking with a MANAGER, a couple of his suited BOSSES
      looking over his shoulder.

                                      ANNIE
                    Mike Edwards and Paul Wilson both
                    had policies with you.  We need to
                    know how Mason Boyle knew about them.

      The manager taps at his computer keyboard throughout:

                                      MANAGER
                    ...Not an employee... Name isn't
                    coming up as an outside adjuster...

                                      ANNIE
                    ... You do any business with
                      Cartwright Construction? 

                                      OFFICE MANAGER
                    Sure, some.  Not one of the more
                    reputable companies...

                                      JIMMY
                    Edwards and Wilson-- those houses
                    built by Cartwright?

                                      MANAGER
                    ... Yes.

                                      ANNIE
                    Who was the appraiser for them?

                                      MANAGER
                    Pete Lofgrun... 
                          (looks up, realizing)
                    ... on both.  

                                      ANNIE
                    Pete ever go to the houses while
                    they're still under construction?

                                      MANAGER
                    Yes.  He inspects the safes in new
                    builds before we insure them. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        29.

                    How many other Cartwright houses was
                    Pete the adjuster on?

                                      MANAGER
                    Total of... 12.

                                      ANNIE
                    I want that list.  And everything
                    else you know about Pete Lofgrun--

      WHOOSH --

      INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT

      Mason is lurking in the back of a truck stop diner.  His
      hair is now black.  PETE LOFGRUN (50s) hurries in, nervous
      as hell.  Takes a beat to recognize Mason, sits down--

                                      MASON
                    Hell's wrong with you, Pete?  Sweating
                    like a virgin at a prison rodeo.

                                    PETE LOFGRUN
                    You shot another family.  I'm doing
                    this for my sister's medical bills--
                    and you're killing people--

                                      MASON
                    I got a strict no-witness policy.  

                                    PETE LOFGRUN
                    The U.S. Marshals showed up at my
                    office today.  They're coming for us--

                                      MASON
                    You talk to 'em, Pete?

                                    PETE LOFGRUN
                    Hell no.  Why would I do that?

      Mason stares at him.  Maybe wondering the same thing.

                                    PETE LOFGRUN (CONT'D)
                    Listen, I just need my money.  I
                    can't go back to my house.  Dunno
                    where I'm gonna go...

                                      MASON
                    You get it at the end, like we said.



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        30.

                    Ain't over till I say it's over.

      A WAITRESS (30s, fragile) arrives at the table.

                                      TRUCK STOP WAITRESS
                    What'll ya have, boys?

      Mason looks up at her, shifting gears on a dime.  Smiles. 
      Like the break of dawn...

                                      MASON
                    You're what I'll have, darlin'. 
                      Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

      The waitress blushes as Mason stares at her.  It's intense
      and weird but damn if she isn't just a little bit seduced...
      customers at other tables picking up on it... Mason looks
      around, realizing.  Abruptly throws a $20 on the table and
      walks out.  As the waitress straightens herself, she catches
      eyes with a terrified-looking Pete Lofgrun...

      INT. ESCALADE - NIGHT

      Jimmy drives as Annie talks on her Blackberry--

                                      ANNIE
                    Hey, Wes, looks like this Pete Lofgrun
                    is an accomplice in your murder case. 
                    We're set up on his house, but he's
                    in the wind, no doubt in my mind...
                          (looks at caller I.D.--)
                    Listen, I got the com center calling
                    me... Okay, talk soon.

                    It's Annie... 
                          (glances at Jimmy,
                            holy shit--)
                    Put him through... Pete?

                                    PETE LOFGRUN (O.S.)
                    I know you're looking for me and I
                    wanna come clean.  I never thought
                    anyone was gonna get hurt, I swear. 
                    This guy's a lunatic--

                                      ANNIE
                    It's all gonna work out, Pete.  Just
                    tell me where you are--

      WHOOSH --                                                                                        31.



      EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT / INT. PETE LOFGRUN'S CAR - NIGHT

      Pete gets in his car parked in the truck stop parking lot,
      his nerves shot.  He glances in his rear-view mirror.  And
      there is Mason, staring at him from the back seat.  Before
      Pete can react, Mason has his knife at Pete's neck-- 

      INT. ESCALADE - INTERCUT

      Annie can hear the sickly sound of Mason slicing Pete's neck--

                                      ANNIE
                    Pete?  Pete.

      INT. PETE LOFGRUN'S CAR / EXT. TRUCK STOP - INTERCUT

      Pete goes limp.  Mason picks up the fallen cell phone.  Puts
      it to his ear as he gets out of Pete's car, steps over to a
      '68 Dodge Charger, and gets inside...

                                      ANNIE (O.S.)
                    ... Mason?  Is that you?  

      INT. ESCALADE - INTERCUT

      Annie listens to Mason BREATHING-- her mind racing, knows
      she only has a couple seconds-- 

                                      ANNIE
                    Mamas don't let your babies grow up
                    to be cowboys/Cause they'll never
                    stay home and they're always alone/
                    Even with someone they love.

      INT. DODGE CHARGER - INTERCUT

      Mason sits listening as Annie quotes the Waylon Jennings
      song, a little unnerved.  A beat, then:

                                      MASON
                    You don't know me.  

      INT. ESCALADE - INTERCUT

      Back with Annie, she's losing him--

                                      MASON (O.S.)
                    Good-bye, Annie Frost.

      Click.  And as Annie slams down her phone in frustration--

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                    I am Mason Boyle... an outlaw cowboy. 
                    They might'a got me the first time,
                    but it ain't gonna happen again. 
                    Not with my prison education.  So as
                    soon as I get out, I look for a gig. 
                    I meet Pete Lofgrun, and I set out
                    to rob 12 safes with a street value
                    of 1.3 million.

                    around.  I see that with 1.3 million

      A crowded country/western bar in San Antonio, "Ramblin' Fever"
      on the juke box.  Mason is cowering in a back corner, eyes
      scanning the crowd, aware of each and every guest including
      a COWBOY and his GIRL in a nearby booth, paying their bill.  

      Mason spots two UNIFORM COPS through the front window.  He
      tenses, watching their every move.  Till they walk past.  

      Mason downs a bourbon, eats the three Maraschino cherries in
      his glass, and watches as the Cowboy couple heads for the
      parking lot out back.  Mason tosses a bill on the table and
      follows them out to--

      She jumps out of the helicopter-- 

      Flattening Mason to the ground.  Roughly cuffing him. 
      Spinning him onto his back like a prize bull--

      But it's not Mason.  

      It's the cowboy from the Silver Spur in Mason's clothes. 
      Traumatized--

      as he does we MOVE IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE...  

      Revealing that it is not the cowboy driving.  Never was. 
      It's Mason.  Smiling that smile of his.

                                      PRINCIPAL
                    This is a religious school.  Only
                    way to sing here is in the choir...

      Annie opens a yearbook to the choir photo.  Off to the side,
      sticking out like a sore thumb with his long hair and
      handlebar moustache, is Mason.  Annie points to his neck--

                                      ANNIE
                    There's his flying "W" tattoo.  

                                      JIMMY
                    ... Waylon frickin' Jennings.  

      Annie points to the girl standing next to him.

                                      ANNIE
                    Looks like his arm's around her...
                          (reads caption)
                    Jessie Lyn Peele.  What about her,
                    did she graduate? 

                                      PRINCIPAL
                    Of course, she was from a good family. 
                    She never would've dated someone
                    like Mason Boyle.

      Annie opens to Jessie Lyn's senior page:  A portrait, a couple
      candids, and a close-up exposing the "W" tattoo on her neck.

                                      ANNIE
                    Guess Jessie Lyn's got a little outlaw
                    cowboy in her too.  She still live
                    around here?

                                      PRINCIPAL
                    No, she moved away after graduation. 
                    I haven't seen her since.  

      Annie looks at Luke. 

                                      ANNIE
                    Let's go find Mason's first love.

      WHOOSH --

      INT. SUN CITY HOTEL (EL PASO) - MASON'S ROOM - DAY

      JESSIE LYN PEELE (now 8 years older), a "Rio Grande Real 

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        40.

      Estate" pin on her lapel, her "W" tattoo still intact, puts
      a plate of Mexican food down in front of Mason.  Mason opens
      packet after packet of hot sauce, pours it on...

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Hell'd you do to your hair, Mason? 
                    And your eyebrows-- they're white.

      Mason smiles at her.  

                                      MASON
                    What, it's cool, right?  Did it just
                    for you...

      Jessie Lyn shakes her head... 

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    You call me outta the blue, ask me
                    to bring you food... You gonna tell
                    me what you're doing in El Paso now?

                                      MASON
                    Well it ain't for the tex-mex.

      He shows her that smile again.  Jessie Lyn smiles back.  But
      it's short-lived...

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Been a long time, Mason.

                                      MASON
                    I wrote you letters, ya know.  All
                    got sent back.  Near broke my heart.

      Jessie Lyn is surprised.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    I never saw 'em.  Musta been my daddy.
                          (then)
                    How long you stickin' around?

                                      MASON
                    Depends on you.  Hopin' it's awhile.

      Jessie Lyn stares at him for a long beat.  Then gets up and
      retrieves something from the entryway.  An old guitar.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Told you I'd watch this for ya...

                                      MASON
                    --You still got it?

      He picks it up, an old friend.  And there's no way he can
      help it, he's got to fire off a quick ditty, fingers like 

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        41.

      lightening.  He's good.  A glimpse of what could've been...

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    I got somethin' for you, too.

      ... He retrieves a distinctive gold necklace.  One we should
        recognize...

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    Jessie Lyn.  I spent the last year
                    saving up good so I could come back
                    to you with my head held high.

      ... Almost like he's taking a vow... 

                                      MASON (CONT'D)
                    I know I been missin' a long time. 
                    But if anything teaches you to cherish
                    what you got, it's bein' on the
                    opposite side of freedom.  

      Jessie Lyn studies him.  Then moves closer.  They kiss.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    ... Now I remember how good you always
                      smelled...

      ... A beat longer, and she gently pushes him away...

                                      JESSIE LYN (CONT'D)
                    You gotta give me some time, okay?

                                      MASON
                    Take as long as you need.  I ain't
                    goin' nowhere...

      INT. N.D. RENTAL CAR / EXT. EL PASO STREET - DAY

      A suburban house.  A car with a "Rio Grande Real Estate"
      logo on the side pulls up.  Jessie Lyn gets out and goes
      inside.  PULL BACK to reveal Annie, Jimmy and Luke watching
      from a rental car.  Luke looks at Jessie Lyn's DMV photo--

                                    LUKE
                    That's definitely her.  We gonna
                    jack her up?

                                      ANNIE
                    Can't do it here.  If Mason sees us
                    he'll sky up again...

      Annie pulls out her Blackberry.  Dials the "Rio Grande Real
      Estate" number on the side of the car.



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        42.

                    Hi, my name's Vivian Powers.  My
                    husband and I are moving to El Paso
                    and we'd like to look at houses...

      EXT. EL PASO - HOUSE FOR SALE - DAY

      Parenting magazines, scissors and glue are strewn across the
      front seat of the rental car... as Annie and Jimmy walk up
      to a house for sale.  Annie hands Jimmy a wedding band.

                                      ANNIE
                    Here.  Will you marry me?

                                      JIMMY
                    I thought you'd never ask.  
                          (puts ring on, then:)
                    Where'd you come up with Vivian?  

                                      ANNIE
                    I dunno.  Just popped in my head. 

                                      JIMMY
                    Better than what you came up with
                    for me... 

      Annie gives him a look.  Knocks.  Jessie Lyn opens the door--

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Hi, Vivian.  Hi, Dwayne.  Welcome to
                    El Paso.  

      Jimmy glances at Annie as they step inside...

      INT. EL PASO - HOUSE FOR SALE - DAY

      Jessie Lyn walks Annie and Jimmy through the house...

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    So, when are y'all relocating?

                                      ANNIE
                    Next month.  Not much time... How're
                    the schools 'round here?

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    This house is in a great district. 
                    How old are your children?

                                      ANNIE
                    Eight and ten.  

      Annie shows Jessie Lyn a photo of an 8-year-old girl and 10-
      year-old boy (cut out from the magazines).


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        43.

                    A girl, Sissy.  She's eight.

      Jessie Lyn shows Annie a photo of an 8-year-old GIRL.  Annie
      studies it.  We see the photo from Annie's perspective... 

                                      ANNIE
                    She has her father's eyes.

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    ... Excuse me?

                                      ANNIE
                    Her eyes, they look exactly like
                    Mason's.

      Jessie Lyn looks at Annie, confused... 

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    ... How do you know Mason?

                    We're not here to look at houses,
                    Jessie Lyn.  We're U.S. Marshals. 
                    We need your help to find him.

                          (a dreadful beat)
                    What did he do?

                                      JIMMY
                    Killed three people in home invasions. 
                    Another two along the way. 

                                      JESSIE LYN
                    Oh God--

      Jessie Lyn searches for a place to put her hands.  Looks
      around the empty house, trying to get her bearings... 

                                      JESSIE LYN (CONT'D)
                    ... I believed him.  I actually

                    These guys'll tell you anything you
                    wanna hear...

      Jessie Lyn's hand goes to the distinctive gold necklace around
      her neck.  She takes it off, gives it to Annie...

                    The Sun City Hotel.  I just talked
                    to him.  He's in his room right now.

      EXT. SUN CITY HOTEL - DAY

      Annie and Jimmy gear up in tactical vests, helmets, and
      weapons behind the hotel.  Everyone else, including Luke, is
      in plain clothes.  An El Paso TFO reports to Annie-- 

                                    EL PASO TFO
                    Corners 1 through 4 are covered.

                    How'd we do with the neighboring
                    rooms, Luke?

                                    LUKE
                    All adjacent rooms are clear.

                          (to Jimmy)
                    Alrighty.  Let's make this look good.

      Annie and Jimmy enter the back stairwell...

      INT. SUN CITY HOTEL - STAIRWELL - DAY

      Annie and Jimmy take the stairs three at a time till they
      reach the fifth floor.  Annie signals to Jimmy.  They break
      out of the stairwell--

      INT. SUN CITY HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY

      Moving down the hallway to room 509.  Jimmy uses the key
      card to pop the door.  Ducks out of the way as Annie enters
      with the shield.  Jimmy sweeps in after her--                                                                                        45.



      INT. SUN CITY HOTEL - MASON'S ROOM - DAY

      Annie and Jimmy enter, guns drawn.  They search under the
      bed, in furniture, closets.  The room's clear.  

      Annie signals to Jimmy:  Maraschino cherry stems in a glass
      by the bar.  Ice still cold.  

      Jimmy nods to the bathroom door:  The shower is running. 

      INT. SUN CITY HOTEL - MASON'S ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

      They pop the bathroom door.  Sweep in.  Annie opens the shower
      curtain.  The tub's empty.  WTF?

      INT. SUN CITY HOTEL - MASON'S ROOM - DAY

      They scour the room further.  And then they see it.  Mason
      punched his way through a wall in the closet into the
      adjoining room.  One of the rooms Luke just evacuated--

                                      ANNIE

      EXT. SUN CITY HOTEL - PARKING LOT - DAY

      A TFO leads Annie and Jimmy toward a female hotel guest in a
      bathrobe.  Her hair is wet.

                                      WOMAN IN BATHROBE
                    I was in the shower-- I heard a loud
                    banging-- then he just walked in. 
                    He was going to take me hostage till
                    someone knocked on the door. 

                                      ANNIE
                    A U.S. Marshal?

                          (nods)
                    He said there was a situation, and
                    that we had to evacuate the room.  

      Annie and Jimmy have heard enough.  Annie nods to the TFO
      from earlier--

                                      ANNIE

      INT. SUN CITY HOTEL - SECURITY ROOM - DAY

      Annie, Jimmy and Luke watch the security video footage of
      the hallway.  Luke looks like he'd rather be dead. 

      ON THE VIDEO: Luke escorts the woman in the bathrobe and her
      shaved-headed "boyfriend" out of the room Mason punched into.  

      Jimmy turns to Luke, ready to eat him alive--

                                      JIMMY
                    That how you been walkin' 'round
                    here the whole time?  Nice tailored
                    shirt all tucked in?

      Luke's shirt is indeed tucked in, unlike seasoned Deputies
      who always wear lose, untucked shirts to conceal their guns.

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    Turd must've looked out his window
                    and seen your weapon.

      Jimmy exhales, shakes his head-- walks out.  Luke is crushed.

                                    LUKE
                    You said to look at the different
                    pieces.  The eyebrows... the nose...

                    Gotta go through the mill, Luke.
                    Can't pick it up overnight...

      Annie's cell phone rings.  She steps out into the--

      She hangs up, turns to Jimmy--

                    He took Sissy.  Must've gone straight

      More forceful than she intended.  Jimmy looks at her.

      WHOOSH --

      INT. LATE MODEL TOYOTA PICK-UP - DAY

      Mason is driving a late model pick-up, gardening equipment
      in the back.  He checks addresses as he passes abandoned
        storefronts, looking for a number scribbled on a bar napkin.  

      SISSY, a street-savvy 9-year-old, is in the passenger seat,
      stealing looks at him.  Surprisingly, she doesn't seem scared. 
      More like she's enjoying this adventure with her dad.

                                      SISSY
                    You look different than your picture. 
                    Mom hides it in her wallet, but I
                    know where it is...

      Mason doesn't respond.  Just keeps driving.  

                                      SISSY (CONT'D)
                    She calls you her outlaw cowboy,
                    cause you were in jail and all.  But
                    I can tell she still likes you...
                          (off his silence)
                    You never shut up, do ya?
                          (then)
                    Where're we going anyway?  This
                      neighborhood is lame.  

      Mason looks at her.  Curious.  His blood.  Then finds the
      address, pulls into an alley around the corner. 

                                      SISSY (CONT'D)
                    Why'd you drive past it?  So they
                    wouldn't see you?  Good idea.

                                      MASON
                    Be quiet and-- stay put.  Y'know...
                    like partners.

      A beat.  And Sissy smiles.  The happiest girl in the world.

                                      SISSY
                    I always knew you'd come back.

      INT. PAWN SHOP - OUTSKIRTS OF EL PASO - DAY

      CLOSE ON jewels seen through a gem scope.  WIDER as a GEM
      DEALER looks up from the scope.  Glances at Mason-- then at
      the wanted poster under the counter.  He knows Mason's
      vulnerable, is looking to take advantage--

                    Best offer.

      Mason stares at him.  He's been on the run a while and it's
      taken its toll.  Mason pulls out his automatic.

                                      MASON
                    Ya sure 'bout that?

                    Alright.  I'll take it.  

      Mason grabs the cash and the gems as TWO ARMED security guards
      appear.  Mason shoots and misses-- off his game, desperate--
      and bolts as they fire after him--

      EXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY

      The guards run out onto the street.  Mason's gone.  They fan
      out as we PAN UP to a security camera, taping it all...

      EXT. ALLEY / INT. LATE MODEL TOYOTA PICK-UP - DAY

      Sissy sees Mason running down the alley toward the passenger
      door.  He jumps in, shoves her into the driver's seat.

                                      MASON
                    Drive.

                                      SISSY
                    I don't know how to--  

                                      MASON
                    Drive.

      The look in his eyes, and Sissy does as she's told.  She
      lurches out of the alley, passing one of the security guards
      who's looking for Mason.

      SECURITY GUARD'S POV:  He sees Sissy driving.  No one in the
      passenger seat.  

      BACK INSIDE THE CAR:  Mason is lying on the floor.                                                                                        50.

                    See if you can enhance it-- grab the
                    plate.  I need that plate.

      The technician gets to work...

                    Why's he taking the kid with him?

                    Drop it.  Okay?

      Jimmy glances at Annie.  She meets his look, gratitude in
      her eyes.

                                      ANNIE

                    Stop here.

      Sissy pulls over, stops the pick-up.  Mason gets out.  Scans
      the river.  The Bridge of the Americas to the east, The Good
      Neighbor Bridge to the west.  He reaches into the truck-bed. 
      Hands Sissy his guitar as she joins him...

                    What, you're not taking me with you?

      Mason looks at his daughter, a flash of something almost
      resembling emotion.   

                                      MASON
                    I was gonna... Just too many damn
                    ways for you to get hurt.

      He slips into day-laborer coveralls and a gardening hat--  

                                      SISSY
                    Please-- I wanna go with you-- 

      She clings to him.  He has to pry her off--

                                      MASON
                    Sorry kid.  For everything.

      He looks at her, surprised by the genuine emotion he feels
      with this kid... Not quite sure what a father would do, he
      kisses her forehead.  Then walks away, blending in with the
      other day-laborers walking along the highway.  Sissy watches
      him go, tears streaking her cheeks...

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:

      Marshals surround the pick-up.  Annie swoops in, gun drawn. 
      Finds Sissy sitting behind the wheel.  She opens the glove
      box, finds the vehicle registration, name JOSE GONZALEZ--  

                                      ANNIE
                    Where did he go?  Sissy-- where is
                    he?

                    I-- I dunno-- okay?

      Annie holsters her gun.  Crouches down next to the girl.

                                      ANNIE
                    Listen, kiddo.  I know it might be
                    hard to believe, but one time I was
                    sitting exactly where you are... 

      Sissy locks eyes with Annie, instantly senses she's telling
      the truth...

                                      SISSY
                    'Kiddo.'  Is that what your father
                    called you?

                                      ANNIE
                    Before he left.
                          (beat)
                    You're gonna be okay, you know that?

                                      SISSY
                    ... Like you?

                                      ANNIE
                    The one thing I found that makes me
                    feel better?  Doing what's right. 
                    No matter how hard it is.  Catching
                    the guys running away, even when you
                    feel like running away yourself.

                                      SISSY
                    I wanted to run away with him, but
                    he didn't want me.

      Annie flinches almost imperceptibly.  More in common with
      this little girl than even she had thought... Then:

                                      ANNIE
                    You think if I let your daddy get
                    away, he'll come back for you?

                                      SISSY
                          (yes)
                    Maybe...

                                      ANNIE
                    You gonna tell me which way he went
                    anyway?

      A long beat.  Sissy swats a tear away.  Then points.

                                      SISSY
                    That way.

                                      ANNIE
                    West?  To the Good Neighbor Bridge?

      Sissy nods.  Annie looks at her, then calls into her radio:




                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        53.

                    He's going east.  To the Bridge of
                    the Americas...  
                          (re: the registration)
                    Possibly with I.D. for Jose Gonzalez.

      Annie stands, ready to go.  Looks at Sissy one last time.

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    I used to cover for my dad, too.

      They lock eyes for a moment.  Till Annie takes off running. 
      And as Sissy watches her go--

      EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS (BOTA) - DAY

      A massive complex of four bridges with eight lanes for
      passenger vehicles, four lanes for commercial trucks, and
      two sidewalks for pedestrians.  1400 passenger cars and 40
      commercial vehicles cross this bridge.  Per hour.  

      Not to mention the thousands on foot.  The southbound traffic
      is backed up the I-110 and down Paisano Street, causing a
      dangerous mix of vehicular and foot traffic.  Idling semis,
      agriculture trucks, cattle trucks, pick-ups, day-laborers. 
      And now Mason's one of them, lost somewhere in the throng.

      Annie heads into the maze of vehicles and people.  A
      harrowing, nerve-wracking search for the bald man with the
      blond eyebrows amidst all that humanity...

      WHOOSH --

      Mason dodges, ducks and weaves between people, trucks and
      cars.  Yet somehow, he can see Annie getting closer.  He
      keeps catching glimpses of those damn boots...  

      He's got the border guards coming up in front of him, and
      the U.S. Marshals closing in behind.  He spots--

      A CONVOY OF CATTLE TRUCKS 

        Transporting bulls back to Mexico after a stateside rodeo. 
      Mason ducks his way toward them.  He gets to the last truck. 
      Throws open the latch in the back, hoping to flood the aisles
      between cars and trucks with stampeding bulls.  

      But they don't move.  Fuck.  

      He gets another idea.  Starts knocking on windows--

                                      MASON
                    Hey.  Gotta smoke?  Anyone spare a
                      cigarette?


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        54.

      CONTINUED:

      Finally a grizzled old GAUCHO hands Mason a cigarette and a
      lighter.  Mason takes off with both...

                                      GAUCHO
                      Pendejo...

      Back to the cattle truck.  He reaches through the front slats
      of the trailer and lights the hay on fire.  The bulls freak
      the fuck out, exploding onto the bridge.  Mason runs to the
      three other trucks and does the same.  

      Fucking Pamplona on the B.O.T.A.

      ON ANNIE AND THE REST OF HER TEAM--

      As 60 angry bulls charge down every lane toward them.  It's
      all they can do to get out of the way, losing sight of Mason.  

      Annie manages to dive into the front opening of the enclosed
      pedestrian lane.  She hoists herself up on the inside of the
      cage canopy and spider-crawls her way forward over the throngs
      of terrified people.  She looks out--

      And there is Mason.  

      On the other side of the cage, crouched next to one of the
      cattle trucks.  He looks up.  And sees Annie.  And WHAM--

      Their two POVs collide. 

      Mason stares at her in disbelief.  Then hauls himself onto
      the TOP of the cage canopy and starts running for the border.

                                      ANNIE
                    Stop!  U.S. Marshals!

      SHOTS ring out.  Mexican Border Patrol is firing on Mason.  

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    Hold your fire!  No tire!

      Mason turns towards Annie.

                                      MASON
                          (fuck you)
                    I ain't going back.  

      And he means it-- 

      MASON JUMPS.  

      Down into the muddy, industrial waters of the Rio Grande.  

      Annie looks down through the grated bridge floor, watching
      the water carry Mason off.  Stuck above-- an excruciating 

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        55.

      CONTINUED:

      reversal of the Glass Bridge chase with the Bull. 

      And damn if Annie doesn't do the same thing.  She finds a
      service access hatch, bolted shut with four large padlocks.  

                                      ANNIE
                    Stand back!  Everyone-- back!

      Pedestrians back away in terror as Annie fires at the locks,
      popping them open and-- 

      ANNIE JUMPS TOO.

      EXT. RIO GRANDE - DAY

      Annie's a good twenty yards behind Mason.  Using her best
      strokes to close the gap.  She pumps harder and harder as
      Mason swims frantically-- desperate to get to the Juarez
      side of the river.  But Annie reaches him and--

      They fight-- borne along by the current.  Mason gets in a
      solid punch and Annie goes under.  All is still for a moment
      as Mason looks around, thinking he might have won until--

      ANNIE POPS UP BEHIND HIM.  SLAMS his skull with the butt of
      her automatic.  Mason goes out cold.  Annie watches him float
      off, tempted to let the river do her job...

      But she gets him in a headlock and begins the arduous swim
      cross-current, back to the shores of the U.S.A.

      EXT. BANKS OF THE RIO GRANDE - DAY

      Annie drags Mason's limp body onto the concrete shoreline
      and cuffs him.  She stands back to catch her breath, as Mason
      comes to, sputtering water, realizing he's busted.   

                                      ANNIE
                    Glad we got to meet in person.  After
                    our phone call was cut short.  
                          (then)
                    Good-bye, Mason Boyle.

      Mason glares at Annie as Daisy, Marco and Luke take him
      away...  Jimmy joins Annie.

                                      JIMMY
                    Nice job, Boots.  

      Annie smiles that smile. 

                                      ANNIE
                    We got him, huh?



                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        56.

      CONTINUED:

                                      JIMMY
                    Got him good.  

                                      ANNIE
                    Alrighty.  Let's get outta here.

      Annie and Jimmy walk off.  As they go, we see Annie stop. 
      Take off a boot, and pour water out of it.  

      INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KATE EDWARDS' HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

      Annie looks into a hospital room.  Inside, Kate Edwards is
      recovering, Kayla by her side.  Kayla sees Annie, steps out--

                                      KAYLA EDWARDS
                    Annie... You caught him.

                                      ANNIE
                    Deal's a deal, right?

      Kayla nods, they share a small smile...

                                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
                    Here, something I want you to give
                    your mom...

      Annie gives Kayla the engagement ring Mason took from Kate...

                                      KAYLA EDWARDS
                    Thanks, Annie.

                                      ANNIE
                    You got it, kiddo.

      Kayla hugs Annie, then goes back inside the room and gives
      her mother the ring.  Kate holds it tight, remembering...
      Nods her silent thanks to Annie through the window.  

      Annie nods back, watching mother and daughter, their first
      glimpse of hope... The reason Annie does this job. 

      INT. FUGITIVE TASK FORCE - NIGHT

      Luke approaches his desk, recoils-- 

                                    LUKE
                    --the hell?

      Something really stinks.  He starts opening drawers, searching
      for the source.  Finally comes up with an open can of tuna
      fish.  He looks up to see Marco and Daisy, stifling laughs. 

                                    LUKE (CONT'D)
                    Thanks, guys.  Really appreciate it.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        57.

      CONTINUED:

      ACROSS THE ROOM

      Annie sits at her desk.  She adds Mason Boyle's completed
      Link Chart to her file case of catches.  A private ritual.

      She stares at the case for a long beat.  Then flips to the
      back.  Pulls out another chart.  

      This one is her father's.  

      She stares at his picture, circa 1985... The nearly empty
      Link Chart... Then focuses on the words, "At large."  As...

                                      CHANTING VOICES (O.S.)
                      Hur-ri-cane!  Hur-ri-cane!

      INT. GILLEY'S BAR - LATER

      The team kicks back at Gilley's.  Straw on the floor, beer
      on the table, Charlie Daniel's Band on the speakers.  Jimmy
      is leading the "Hur-ri-cane" chant, directed at Daisy-- 

      Who's riding the mechanical in the middle of it all.  She
      holds on till the end, then jumps down, triumphant.  Annie
      high-fives her as they head back to--

      THEIR TABLE

      Where Jimmy yells to the WAITRESS (SUE, 20s) above the music-- 

                                      JIMMY
                    Round of beef ribs, Sue!

                                    SUE
                    Extra sauce?

                                      JIMMY
                    You bet!

      Sue nods and heads off.  Luke stops her--

                                    LUKE
                    Um, sorry-- you have anything, you
                    know, vegetarian? 

      Sue looks at him blankly.

                                    SUE
                    You mean with pork?  

      Jimmy shakes his head.

                                      JIMMY
                    This is H-Town.  Not Georgetown. 
                    Eat some ribs, Green Bean.

                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                                                        58.

      CONTINUED:

      Luke gives Jimmy a look, as Annie puts a coin on the table. 
      A challenge coin.  Something U.S. Marshals carry wherever
      they go.  Jimmy, Marco and Daisy quickly do the same.  

      Luke looks around the table.  They're all grinning at him. 

                                    LUKE
                    You haven't even given me a coin
                    yet.

                                      ANNIE
                    Sorry, Luke.  As my old friend George
                    Jones once wrote, "There's more old
                    drunks than there are old doctors,
                    so I guess we'd better have another
                    round."  Looks like you're buying.

      And as Luke digs out his wallet...

      INT. GILLEY'S - DANCE FLOOR - LATER

      CLOSE ON ANNIE'S BOOTS, as our team country line dances on
      the packed dance floor.  Swept up in the beat, the whole
      crowd moving as one.  Clap-step-step.  Clap-step-step. 
      LAUGHING, enjoying the hell out of this.  

      Luke, the outsider for now, watches from the sidelines as:

      WE PUSH IN ON ANNIE'S FACE.  A brief moment of peace.  This
      music, her escape... 

      Until her cell phone rings.  She looks down at it, her whole
      demeanor going serious.  And as the chase begins again--

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                        THE END
