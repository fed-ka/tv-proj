                                         TEASER

      FADE IN:


      An earthy Bay Area yoga studio.  Painted with bright 
        colors and funky kid-friendly designs.  CROSBY and JABBAR 
        are the lone father/son team in a sea of YOGA MOMS and 
        their KIDS enjoying an afternoon of frolic and delight at 
         Mommy and Me Yoga .  The entire class is on all fours.  

                                        YOGA INSTRUCTOR
                      Now breathe in, finding a spot in front 
                      of you to focus on.

        Crosby s eyes focus on AN ASS.  A good one.  Clad in 
        spandex.  We ll come to find this ass belongs to a hot 
      yoga mom named VALERIE.

                                        YOGA INSTRUCTOR (CONT D)
                      Inhale arching up like a cat.  Exhale 
                      extending out like a cow.

        Valerie cycles through Cat and Cow Pose jutting her ass 
      up and down right in Crosby s face.  Crosby turns to 
        Jabbar who is also doing Cat and Cow.    

                                        CROSBY
                      You were right, Jabbar.  Yoga is fun.  

                                        JABBAR
                      Shhh.  You re not supposed to talk.

                                        YOGA INSTRUCTOR
                      Hips up into downward facing dog.

        Crosby, confused, remains on all fours.  Valerie pops up 
          effortlessly.  From this angle she looks at Crosby 
        through spread legs.  Their eyes meet.  Is she 
          intentionally staring at him?  

                                        JABBAR
                      Dad, you re doing it wrong.

        The class cycles through a Vinyasa.  When they return to 
      down dog...

                      And he takes his yoga very seriously.  

        Valerie s son, MILO, speaks up.

                                        MILO
                      I m five too.

                                        VALERIE
                      Jabbar, I think this is what the yogis 
                      would call fate.  Would you boys like to 
                      come over for a playdate?

        Crosby nods subtly at Jabbar.  Come on.  Say yes.

                                        JABBAR
                      Okay.  

        Valerie gives Crosby a playful wink and the Instructor s 
        voice takes over...

                      Breathe out... Deep relaxing sigh... 

      As Crosby lets out a long relaxing sigh...

                                                                              PRELAP:

                      You have to breathe, Adam.



        A disaster area.  Old sports equipment and file boxes 
        insure no car will ever park here.  ADAM has lined up the 
      four Braverman family bikes which are all in various 
        stages of disrepair.  KRISTINA, rifling through a 
        Goodwill box of old clothes, watches over his shoulder as 
      he struggles to pull the chain back on Max s bike.    

                                        ADAM
                      Almost there.  Almost there.

        Kristina moves aside Adam s old surfboard and uncovers 
        the GOODWILL BOX.  She digs out a pair of her old HEELS.

                                        KRISTINA (CONT D)

                                        ADAM
                      Have you looked at our family calendar 
                      lately?  Between Max s new schedule, my 
                      work, Haddie s school commitments and of 
                      course... 
                              (with disdain)
                       Steve time .  That only leaves three 
                      hours a week where the entire family is 
                      free.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      But does it have to be spent on bikes?

        HADDIE appears in the doorway.

                                        HADDIE
                      What s up?

        Kristina holds up the shoes.  Adam continues struggling 
      with the chain throughout the following.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      What about these for tomorrow?  They were 
                      in the Goodwill.

                                        HADDIE
                      You re not serious.  Mom, Aunt Julia 
                      works in a real office.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      I wore these real places.

                                        ADAM 
                      What is she talking about?

                                        KRISTINA
                      She s spending a day at work with your 
                      sister.  

                                        HADDIE
                      It s career week.  I get to take Monday

                      Am I obligated to answer that?

        Suddenly the chain snaps into place.  

                                        ADAM 
                      I got it!  I got it!  Did you see that?

                      Yeah, honey.  It was awesome.  

                                        HADDIE
                      Oh God.  This is one of those Braverman 
                      family fun things, isn t it?

                                        ADAM
                      Yes.  It is.  Prepare for an epic 
                      afternoon of fun and togetherness.    

                                        HADDIE
                      I m seeing a movie at five with Steve.  
                      Mom already gave me permission.  

      Adam shoots a look to Kristina who just shrugs.

                                        KRISTINA
                      I didn t know this was going to be epic.  

                                        ADAM
                      That still leaves us fifty-two minutes 
                      for quality Braverman bonding.  Mount up.  
                      I ll grab the boy.

                      The boy still has forty minutes left with 
                      Gaby.
                              (off their looks)
                      What?  His schedule is on a giant 
                      calendar in the kitchen.  Kinda hard to 
                      miss.

                                        KRISTINA
                      Maybe we should do this another time.

                                        ADAM
                      No way.  This is gonna be great!  

        Adam, still happy, sprints past Kristina.

                      session.  Come on.  A whole Sunday 
                      afternoon off.  I m sure there are lots

                      Absolutely.  I know it is, Adam.  But 
                      we re really making strides on his 
                      sticker system and I d hate to derail all 
                      that hard work.

                      I finished math.  Can I have my Spiderman

                                        GABY
                      Our deal was you d get the stickers when 
                      you complete math and reading.

                      Okay.  Can we start reading then?

      This is a victory and Adam knows it.  It kills him, but 
      he looks to Gaby and motions for her to continue their 
        lesson.

                      Why?

                                        AMBER
                      I need something with a timer.  It s for 
                      a school thing so you re not really 
                      allowed to say no.  

        Sarah takes her watch off and hands it to Amber.

                                        SARAH
                      Don t pawn it.   

        Sarah looks back in the mirror, unsure.  

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      Does this look okay?

                                        AMBER
                      I think you look completely 
                        pulchritudinous. 

        Sarah looks back in the mirror -- pulchritudinous?  She 
        sighs and goes back to her closet.

      It s lunchtime and Amber is perched Indian style atop a 
        student desk.  Mr. Cyr sits atop his own desk holding up 
        a VOCAB CARD -- OBSTREPEROUS.  Even though they re 
        studying, the vibe is light and teasing.

                      Seriously.  Call my mom for proof.  

        Mr. Cyr looks away.  Quickly changes the subject. 

                                        MR. CYR 
                      Do you have your iPod with you?

        Mr. Cyr plugs Amber s iPod into his MAC.  She walks 
        behind him and puts her hand on his chair to see.  The 
        closeness registers on her face.  Oblivious to her raging 
      teen hormones, Mr. Cyr downloads a playlist simply titled

        She gives them a wink.  The TWO CLIENTS trade an 
        impressed look.  Adam can barely keep himself from 
        rolling his eyes.  His cell rings.

      By the looks of things it s a long while later.  Several 
        empty margarita pitches are on the table.  The clients 
        are out on the dance floor leaving Adam alone at the 
        table.  Bored and antsy.  He tries to give the WAITRESS 
        his credit card.

        His phone rings.  Adam steps over to the bar area.

                      It was a false alarm.  Max melted down 
                      during the trailers so they came back 
                      early.  I was calling to see if you could 
                      pick up cornflakes on your way home.

                                        ADAM
                      You just bought cornflakes.

                        I accidentally got the ones with 
                        strawberries.  Max says they look like 
                      toes.

                      Great...  Yeah.  I m on it.

      Adam hangs up.  He s about to go back to his table when 
      he sees something unexpected

        ANGLE ON THE BAR

        Where Gaby is dancing with a gaggle of girlfriends.  
        She s carefree.  And loud.  Everything she s not at work.  
        She holds up her shot and throws it back like a pro.  The 
        girls squeal and call for another round.  

      Adam watches with confusion.  And intrigue.  And 
        jealousy.

                                        WAITRESS (O.S.)
                      And a virgin pina colada for you, sir.

      Adam turns to see the Waitress standing there with a 
        froufrou drink teeming with whipped cream and a parasol.  
      As Adam wonders when this became his life...

        Kristina is doing her whirlwind morning routine thing.  
      Adam enters, boxers and a shirt, looking seriously 
        hungover.

                                        KRISTINA
                      Oh God.  How many margaritas did you 
                      have?

      Adam holds up two fingers.

                                        KRISTINA (CONT D)
                      You re pathetic.  Adorable.  But 
                      pathetic.  Aspirin s in the cabinet.

      Adam grabs the bottle and struggles to open it.

                                        KRISTINA (CONT D)
                      You might want to consider pants.  Gaby 
                      should be here any second.

                      I think Gaby might be calling in sick.

                      You re kidding.  Is she even old enough 
                      to drink?   

                                        ADAM
                      Oh yeah.  And if two margaritas can do 
                      this to a man, I can only imagine what 
                      ten tequila shots looks like.

                      No way.  Sticker System Gaby was shooting

                      It was like a Girls Gone Wild video.

                      Wow, I can t believe you handle all those 
                      big corporate merger cases and still have 
                      time to take on something like this.

                      Oh.  I don t...  This case isn t mine... 
                        specifically... Per se.  But the money I 
                      make for the firm is what allows them to 
                      take on these sorts of cases.

        But Crosby can t help it and joins in.  Crosby looks up 
        and meets Jasmine s eyes.  Suddenly the laughter stops 
        and the moment becomes loaded.  Could a kiss be coming?  
        But Jabbar s hair comes loose.  He stirs and puts his 
        little arms around Jasmine s neck.

                      the first time I addressed council. I was 
                      introducing an ordinance to reduce the 
                      number or roadside billboards.  

        Haddie glances at the minutes trying to muster interest.

                      a lot of billboards...

                      Because they would block views.

        Kristina looks up to find the reason she might never go 
      back to work standing before her in a pirate costume.  
        She somehow manages a big cheery smile.

                      Eggs?  I think we can do eggs.

        his wife switch gears like that breaks his heart.

        Crosby and Valerie mess around in Valerie s bed.  There s

      He maneuvers Valerie so he s on top for a better look.

                      anything.

        OFF Sarah, this conversation might have come a day late. 


        Julia sits in the office of her boss and respected senior 
        partner, LEON DENGRAF.  There s a sense that they ve been 
        meeting about other things.  But that part of the meeting 
      is over and she is talking to Leon about what has moved 
      to the forefront of her mind over the past few days.

                      But there s good news.  It passes.

                      What about wanting to spend more time 
                      with your girl?

        She looks at him.  There s something vulnerable in her 
        eyes.  Which make him see her a little like a daughter, 
        which he hates.

                      are going places.  Let s back burner the 
                      pro bono work.  Plenty of time for that 
                      down the road.  

      As in never.  As Julia takes this in, Jack (the assistant 
      from earlier) walks in with two lattes.  As he hands the 
        latte to Julia:

                      Extra foamy.

        Julia sips from her latte, the excitement about her 
        promising future tempered by the fact that she is sort of 
        working for the wrong side.

                                        ADAM
                      I m sorry.  You know this isn t about 
                      you.

                                        KRISTINA
                      Then what is it about? 

                                        ADAM
                      Maybe the fact that Crosby can t even go 
                      on a date without consulting me.  Or the 
                      fact that Sarah needs a father-figure for 
                      her kids.  And how am I supposed to say 
                      no to that?  And then there s our kids.  
                      Never mind that I have to make family 
                      time so freaking spectacularly epic that 
                      our teen daughter might actually want to 
                      spend it with us.  And Max.  God... Max.  
                      If I could just figure out what he needs 
                      it would be a start. 

        Adam, now exhausted, sits.  Kristina joins him.   

                                        KRISTINA
                      So take a break.

                                        ADAM
                      Did you just hear me?  I can t. 

                                        KRISTINA
                                (firm)
                      Adam.  Take.  A.  Break.  

      On Adam, carrying the weight of the world...

        She doesn t wait to be invited in.

                      In two years Amber will be in college.  
                      God willing.  And you ll be thirty.  Well, 
                      almost.  So that seems like a really good 
                      time for us to go on a third date.

                      Wait.  What just happened?

                      I asked you out on a date.

                      In two years.  Did you...  Did you just 
                      break up with me?

                                        SARAH
                      Right now this is the best I can do.

                      I don t understand.  This was working.

                                        SARAH
                      But this isn t the part of my life that 
                      needs to be working.  I moved back 
                      because I m trying like hell to put my 
                      family back together.  So for right 
                      now...  I m sorry.    

        Mr. Cyr takes a minute to absorb it.  He s stung.

                      I know.  It sucks.

        Sarah musters everything and leaves.  Makes the mistake 
      of looking back.  Damn, he s cute.  OFF Sarah, heart

      It s early.  Ungodly early.  The morning stillness is 
        punctuated by a sharp WHIRRING SOUND.

      We find Sarah sharpening a stack of Number 2 Pencils.  
        Amber, still groggy, comes down the stairs emerges.

                                        AMBER
                                (seeing Sarah)
                      What are you doing up so early?

                                        SARAH
                      I know you have your SAT this morning.  I 
                      made coffee.  And I know you always say 
                      you hate breakfast but I thought maybe 
                      you would consider eating a protein bar.  

        Sarah hands over a travel coffee mug and a protein bar.  

                                        AMBER
                      I m not hungry.

        Sarah gives her the pencils.  

                                        SARAH
                      Here.  So you ll have plenty of backups.

                      I ve got it under control, Mom.  

        Amber leaves without taking any of Sarah s offerings.  

                                        SARAH
                      Amber!

        Amber turns around.  There s so much Sarah wants to say.  
        But she can t seem to muster any of it. 

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      Good luck.

        And Amber s gone.

      Adam moves aside a good ten years worth of bullshit -- a 
      long abandoned badminton set, kids car seats no longer 
        needed, a crib -- until he finds what he s looking for -- 
        his true love, aside from Kristina of course.  And his 
        children.  Of course.  His surfboard.  It s been at least 
        ten years.



        Sarah is behind the bar drying out glasses, preparing for 
        the lunch rush -- a bit fidgety.  Frank senses something 
        going on with her.

                      something s wrong.

        Kristina folds laundry when a Peet's Coffee latte appears 
      in front of her as if by magic.  She turns around to find 
        Haddie with STEVE, holding their own Peet's Coffee.

                      actually worse for you than the regular
