The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons
already disintegrating.
MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ship's
skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --
including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts
the ship into a dangerous roll.
And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll. But the
ship's still coming in nose-high.
No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN
through the clouds.
An airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into...
The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:
ZEKE and SHAZZA. Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in
life. Shazza has a tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal
blood. (30s.)
PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry of a man. (40s or
50s.)
Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and
THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The
Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They
have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab
Muslims.)
WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain.
The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,
spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are
two suns -- one red, one yellow.
PARIS
Well. Our own little slice of heaven.
The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to
orient themselves.
IMAM
Please...which way to New Mecca? We must
know the direction in order to pray.
North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a
compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING
inside the ship finally ends.
The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together,
each faces a different compass point.
Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza,
Audrey are already here.
JOHNS
Big talk about a scouting party...
Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship.
One glance confirms that there are no other survivors.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
...then we saw this.
PARIS
Anyone else having breathing problems?
Aside from me?
AUDREY
Like I just ran, or something....
SHAZZA
Feel one lung short. All of us.
PARIS
Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And
with all this dust....
Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers.
FRY
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure,
not enough oxygen. Might take a few days
to --
ZEKE
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
FRY
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a
rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
SHAZZA
Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking
grateful. This beast wasn't made to land
like this. But cripes, you rode it down.
(to others)
C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason
we're alive is a'cuzza her.
Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders.
HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their
savior.
Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.
Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby.
It's Riddick's mouth-bit.
JOHNS
Like we needed another way to die.
Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He
fixates on...
A blue glow on the horizon. "What the hell is it?"
Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing
and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks
on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on
demand rather than in a constant flow.
Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for
travel.
Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun,
low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow.
FRY
Imam. We should leave soon. Before
nightfall but while it's cooler.
ZEKE
What, you're goin' off, too?
FRY
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a
favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They
were good guys who died bad.
SHAZZA
A'course we will.
PILGRIM #1 (O.S.)
Imam...Imam....
(NOTE: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-MAM.")
Fry and the others round the ship to see...
A blue star flaring into view. It's rising as the other suns are
setting.
SHAZZA
My bloody oath....
AUDREY
Three suns?
ZEKE
(to Fry)
So much for your nightfall.
PARIS
So much for my cocktail hour.
IMAM
We take this to be a good sign -- a path,
a direction from God.
Johns swings down from the top of the ship.
JOHNS
A very good sign.
(re: blue sun)
That's Riddick's direction. You do not
wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
FRY
Thought you found his restraints over
there. Toward sunset.
JOHNS
(nodding)
Which means he went toward sunrise.
Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM
THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides
shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder.
Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd,
odd sight.
Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi.
Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps.
FRY
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of
the ship, then....
IMAM
You know who Muhammad was?
FRY
Some prophet guy?
IMAM
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But
he had to travel to the desert -- where
there was quiet -- to hear the words of
God.
FRY
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
IMAM
(nodding)
Chrislam teaches that once in every
lifetime should there be a great hajj --
a great pilgrimage. To know God, better,
yes, but to know yourself as well.
FRY
Frightening thought.
IMAM
(finishes wrapping her)
We're all on the same hajj now.
Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something.
FRY
What?
JOHNS
(hands her scope)
Tell me it's not a mirage.
SCOPE POV: Beyond a distant rise, strange branches.
FRY
Trees?
Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with
the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir
with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts
of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.
ZEKE (O.S.)
Comfy up there?
Zeke appears below. He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,
cable, pick-ax.
PARIS
Amazing how you can do without the
essentials of life -- so long as you have
the luxuries.
ZEKE
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes
open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up
on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on
Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,
pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips, a blade touches his
throat.
AUDREY
He'd probably get you right here, right
under the jaw. And you'd never hear him
coming. That's how good Riddick is.
Paris eases the hunting boomerang away.
PARIS
Now did you run away from your parents?
Or did they run away from you?
The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.
PILGRIMS
Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....
The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an
oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.
They don't move in the wind.
The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry,
Johns and Imam catch up to behold...
The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,
tinted green by lichen. Beyond is a sea of bleached animal
bones. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told,
it's like Hell overflowed right here.
FRY
Is this whole planet dead?
A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.
IMAM
He asks what could have killed so many
great things...
Moving into the boneyard:
IMAM
Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...
like the elephants of Earth....
Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks --
almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. "Graveyard? Or
killing field?"
JOHNS
Long time ago. Whatever happened.
Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.
Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By
moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" DIRGELIKE
MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:
PILGRIM #1
Ah....
He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns
back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. But
it's only...
Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her
breather.
Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her
some.
FRY
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you
even more.
JOHNS
Probably right.
They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against
the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...
She steps away.
FRY
Better keep moving....
JOHNS
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching
the switch?
Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and
again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick
now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!
JOHNS (CONT'D)
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
FRY
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
JOHNS
You see anybody else here? Just between
you and me.
FRY
During the landing...when things were
at their worst...Owens was at his best.
He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot
dump the passenger cabin.
Johns blinks, stunned. "Are you shittin' me?"
Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the
hills. Ahead is a canyon.
JOHNS
Hold up.
He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
Didn't bite.
FRY
What?
JOHNS
Thought he might be coolin' it in the
boneyard -- could either double-back to
the ship or slip in behind us. So I left
the bottle out as bait.
SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's
still got that one swallow.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
But nah. Didn't bite.
CLOSER on the bottle. Only we see that the scotch has been
emptied -- and replaced with sand.
Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave.
Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...
The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.
The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib
bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.
Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible
on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. "What are
they? Just mineral deposits?"
PILGRIM #1
Captain...captain....
The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.
Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.
ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?
FRY
Wait, wait, wait....
Fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the
core. They all stare. It's a baseball.
IMAM
We are not alone here, yes?
They look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is
looking back.
JOHNS
Never thought we were.
HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry,
Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.
PILGRIM #1
Assalamoo ahlaykum!
The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked
shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A
rusty bike lies on the ground.
PILGRIM #2
Assalamoo ahlaykum!
JOHNS
Long gone. Whoever they were.
They move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them
looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.
Old jugs litter the ground.
IMAM
Water...water there was here....
PILGRIMS
Allahu Akbar....
IMAM
(translating)
"God is Great," yes?
JOHNS
I'm born-again.
Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the
abandoned buildings. "Who were these people? Why did they
leave so much behind?"
Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the
settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back
inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry
turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the
source of the glint.
Excited hits on her breather.
Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic
bearing. Soon she's running.
FRY (V.O.)
Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!
Johns and the Chrislams trade looks.
FRY
Allahu Akbar!
Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch
up. They too marvel at...
The skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush
plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but
the hull looks intact.
CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points.
A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his
rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...
A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a
dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.
PARIS
This now qualifies as the worst fun I've
ever had. Stop it.
No response.
War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the
perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked
with? Again? He hopes?
PARIS
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
AUDREY (O.S.)
What?
Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where
he expected.
Fry exits the skiff.
FRY
No juice, looks like it's been laid up
for years. But we might be able to
adapt --
JOHNS
Shut up.
Outside, Johns has an ear cocked to the wind.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
FRY
Like what?
JOHNS
Like my pistola.
START on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger.
Zeke reaches the grave. The sun-tarp has fallen on one side,
blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to
unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:
There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.
ZEKE
Now what the bloody hell....
Zeke hops down into the grave. CAMERA MOVES to reveal Riddick
hidden among the spires. He's been waiting for a chance just
like this.
Zeke drops to all fours. Looks into the tunnel. There seems to
be some kind of burrow beyond.
BURROW POV: Staring back at Zeke.
Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow.
It's the last thing he ever does.
As MORE GUNSHOTS jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza.
FURIOUS CLOSEUPS: Zeke fighting for his life. PISTOL BLASTING.
Something slashing at him. Blood dancing on air.
Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for...
The grave. She slaps aside the tarp to find...
Riddick. Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of
the grave. Shazza looks down. And SCREAMS.
CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running
from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and
SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits
ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.
JOHNS
Same crap, different planet, huh?
Sucking on their breathers, Fry and the Chrislams make it back to
the ship. They find Johns beating Riddick like a chained dog.
JOHNS
...I don't play that...I don't play that
so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell
me a better lie....
FRY
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me
what....
She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick.
SHAZZA
What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick
animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke?
Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no
sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv.
FRY
He used that?
JOHNS
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
FRY
So why isn't it all bloody?
JOHNS
I assume he licked it clean.
Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site.
Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as...
JOHNS
I know what happened -- he went off on the
guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and
now he's trying to --
FRY
Let's just be sure.
JOHNS
I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick
belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He
loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you
afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And
you're playing right into --
FRY
We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ,
you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this?
We gotta go down and find it.
JOHNS
Well, don't ask me to.
FRY
Thought you didn't believe his story.
JOHNS
I don't. But that ground looked none too
stable, and I don't want anyone --
AUDREY
If you're afraid, I'll go.
He shoots Audrey a scowl.
FRY
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
JOHNS
(pulling her aside)
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now
doesn't change what came before -- it's
just stupid.
FRY
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove
something?
JOHNS
You said it, not me. Let's just not let
one bad call lead to another.
FRY
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
"Now get outta my way."
Chain hooked to her web belt, Fry drops into the grave. She
peers into the burrow...looks back up at the halo of faces above
her...then slithers out of sight.
CLOSE on the chain slithering through hands, playing out as Fry
moves deeper underground.
IMAM
Did you hear....
They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave,
listening. Nothing now.
...and birth her into daylight. Overlapping:
JOHNS
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got
you now....
IMAM
The child heard you before any of us could
even....
SHAZZA
Did you find him? You find Zeke?
FRY
(half insane)
...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was...
goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't
Riddick. Somethin' else down there that
got Zeke and nearly got --
Her. She flies back into the spire. Something's still got the
chain.
The others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human
hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans
are losing. Until...
Imam unsheathes his blade...
And slices through Fry's belt.
FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the
Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid
the activity, Audrey pauses to look at...
The spired hills.
EXTREMELY WIDE: Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising.
The survivors trek for the settlement. Fry and Imam lug the
power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by...
Riddick. Promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden,
he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo.
PARIS
(to Johns)
So just like that. Wave your little wand
and he's one of us now.
JOHNS
Didn't say that. But least this way I
don't have to worry about falling asleep
and not wakin' up.
IMAM
Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.
SHAZZA
Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his
forgiveness. Right you are.
IMAM
At least give the man some oxygen....
JOHNS
He's happy just bein' vertical. Leave him
be.
AUDREY
So I can talk to him now?
JOHNS/SHAZZA
(in unison)
No.
Paris drops a wine bottle. Trailing, Riddick collects it.
PARIS
Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer,
entrepreneur.
RIDDICK
(shaking hands)
Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,
murderer.
Instead of returning the bottle, Riddick opens it and drinks.
Paris hurries to catch up to the others.
PARIS
You know, if I owned Hell and this
planet...I believe I'd rent this out and
live in Hell.
FRY'S POV: Of spires high above us.
The group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on
the spires. Fry stops short, hearing...
CLICKITY-CLICK.
Neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes. The group starts
moving again, faster.
CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICK.
Are they being stalked? Nervously, Fry traces the sound back
to...
Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1. Whenever he moves,
the STRINGS CLACK together.
PARIS
I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques,
but, uh....
The survivors have reached the settlement. Fry is trying to get
the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior.
JOHNS
Little ratty-ass.
FRY
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the
electrical adapts.
SHAZZA
Not a star-jumper.
RIDDICK
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back
up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick
out a thumb. You'll get picked up.
(to Fry)
Right?
Fry looks from Riddick to Johns. "How did he know that?"
FRY
Little help here?
They muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but
Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside.
JOHNS
Check those containers for me. See what
we can patch wings with.
With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture-
recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to.
He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended
chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back...
Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through
FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst.
CLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation
while awaiting...
The first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette.
Tongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now
another and another. It brings CHEERS.
Hands digging in dirt.
Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the
entrance of a tall windowless structure.
He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light...
and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel
clean. The robot's language program warbles to life:
ROBOT
"...to all intruders. I am the guardian
of this land. I will protect my masters
at all cost. Death to all intruders..."
Riddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a
small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing
now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign.
"Coring Room."
JOHNS (O.S.)
Missin' the party. C'mon.
It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks
a trash bin. Hard.
RIDDICK
Missin' the party. C'mon.
He leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat.
AUDREY (O.S.)
Talkin' to me?
CLOSE on the "Coring Room" sign. An attached solar panel begins
moving, orienting toward sunlight. When it catches the full
brunt of the suns' rays...
STORM SHUTTERS unlatch on the roof.
As Imam hears the SCREAM.
IMAM
Ali....
As the survivors run for the coring room.
Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service.
Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar.
Crossing the yard in wide strides:
FRY
...need those cells from the crash ship.
Shit, still gotta check out the hull,
patch the wings --
JOHNS
Let's wait on the power cells.
FRY
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we
can't even find our way back to --
JOHNS
We're not sure when it happens, so let's
not --
FRY
Get the fucking cells over here, Johns.
What's the discussion?
A beat.
JOHNS
Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?
Johns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field
table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now,
anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs
through Johns.
RIDDICK
Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat.
Johns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of
Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table.
Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was
just there.
RIDDICK
(looking after Johns)
I'll cut.
He has the knife.
As Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat.
CLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran.
Riddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and
delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old
Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on...
The setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet.
Fry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes
gang-locked on...
An arch in the sky. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.
PARIS
What do my eyes see?
FRY
It's starting....
They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two
suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first.
SHAZZA
(to Fry)
If we need anything from the crash ship --
I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's
solar.
MULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching
up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat.
FRY
LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!
Sand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and
Audrey running, catching up.
SHAZZA
We stay together! C'mon!
...and catches up to the sand-cat. Riddick reels him aboard.
RIDDICK
Don't wanna miss this.
AUDREY
Lookit. Lookit!
They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting
over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings.
The sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the
massive ribcage...
The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones.
The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris
steals a look at...
The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.
Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it
and the ship.
The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.
Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second.
They're racing the eclipse and each other.
As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun.
It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in
light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.
FRY
Don't stop, don't stop....
But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see...
The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there.
As the rings eclipse the red sun.
A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop,
beholding...
Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light,
it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these
are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their
first nightfall.
JOHNS
Jesus, how many can there....
They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully,
the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves
from another -- and does a quick about-face.
PARIS
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should
flee.
FRY
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.
lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...
Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE
descending on them...
Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just
inches overhead.
CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being
underwater.
CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a
kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he
eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled
down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades.
The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the
cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?
AUDREY
Tell her to stay there. Stay down.
SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!
Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the
hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her
feet...
FRY
No, no, NO, NO, NO....
...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza.
Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a
last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in
the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.
Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone
about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands
clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...
A rising GANG-CLICKING.
CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.
The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.
Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look.
PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his
jaguar eyes.
RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult
hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian,
hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the
world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.
FRY
What is it? What's happening?
RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding,
SOUNDING, searching.
RIDDICK
Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry
about.
The rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark.
The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal
light remains, we see clouds forming.
Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is
pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.
Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not
to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...
The main cabin. Blackness inside.
FRY
Riddick.
He lifts his goggles.
RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage
but no life.
RIDDICK
Looks clear.
Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. Just as he stands up
inside...
A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS over his head, fleeing the cabin, taking off
into the night.
JOHNS
Fuck me. You said "clear."
RIDDICK
Said "looks clear."
JOHNS
Well, what's it look like now?
RIDDICK
(rechecking)
Looks clear.
FRY
Just get the goddamn lights on....
They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns.
He isn't amused.
CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to
create...
A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,
BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...
Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside
him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into
the chains. The hands belong to...
Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping
his captor into chains.
FRY
(to all)
Keep the light going. That's all we have
to do to live through this. Just keep
your light burning.
Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light
down his back. A beacon.
RIDDICK
(to Fry)
Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. I want
light on my back -- but not in my eyes.
And check your cuts. These things know
our blood now.
CLOSE on Audrey. Overhearing, she goes stone-faced.
FRY
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some
kind of deal. Just in case, you know,
this actually --
RIDDICK
(shaking head)
Had it with deals.
FRY
But I just wanted to say --
RIDDICK
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose.
I fuckin' knew better.
It worries Fry. "If he doesn't expect to go free...."
RIDDICK (CONT'D)
Been a long time since anyone's trusted
me. That's somethin' right there.
FRY
We can, can't we? Trust you?
RIDDICK
Actually...
(completely genuine)
That's what I been askin' myself.
He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a
terrible, terrible mistake.
The drag-sled begins moving.
SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off,
eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like
malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side-
guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position
carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling
along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every
shadow a threat. They are a train of light.
CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles
of booze.
CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.
Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their
lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND,
the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from
above, awaiting their chance.
FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.
JOHNS
So you noticed too?
FRY
Riddick. Riddick.
The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on
breathers as they muster inside the light.
FRY
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't
we still following them?
RIDDICK
Saw something I didn't like.
JOHNS
Such as.
RIDDICK
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...
but looked like a bunch of those big boys
chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought
we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Paris looks over his shoulder. "We went around what?" Nearby
CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.
FRY
Let's move.
(to Audrey)
Just a detour. He'll get us there.
PARIS
Can we switch?
FRY
What, switch what?
PARIS
I think I twisted my ankle running
backwards like that. And I'm not sure I
can....
(off their stares)
Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to
be alone back there anymore. If you could
just give me a few minutes up front here --
JOHNS
She's the pilot, she should stay close to
the cells.
PARIS
Oh, so I'm disposable?
FRY
I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just
get this train moving!
They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.
At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING
never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his
torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.
PARIS
Light, please, need light here....
Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he
refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.
PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.
A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam
lunges at the last nanosecond...
And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...
CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back.
Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator
is long gone.
IMAM
(trembling)
Please...have we been cut? Can someone
tell me if....
He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again.
Broken.
In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something
slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws.
PARIS
Oh, sweet Jesus....
The bottle drops.
The blood flows.
The CLICKING STOPS.
PARIS
Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME
LIGHT OVER HERE!
Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...
Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur.
Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a
youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't
find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the
youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators
start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a
pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS
AGAIN to include the object of their desire. Audrey.
CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.
CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS.
Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.
FRY
What do you see? Riddick?
RIDDICK
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
As clouds mass.
Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.
Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS
at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly
well, until...
The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch
from Audrey.
FRY
Bottle-count.
AUDREY
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're
halfway there? I hope?
Good question. They've just been blindly following...
The light on Riddick's back.
FRY
Can we pick up the pace?
Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself. "If you think you
can do better...." Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest,
spotting...
A sled-track. In front of them.
Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...
Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun
into the back of Riddick's neck.
JOHNS
We aren't completely stupid.
FRY
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in
the fucking --
IMAM
We crossed our own tracks.
JOHNS
He's running us 'round in circles. Look
for yourself. Look!
FRY
Riddick? What the hell are you --
RIDDICK
Listen.
Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of
plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now.
RIDDICK
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some
time to think.
FRY
Think about what?
JOHNS
About how to kill us and still get these
cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just
doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
RIDDICK
(answering Fry)
About the girl.
FRY
What about her?
RIDDICK
What it's gonna be like when we hit that
canyon. With her bleeding.
JOHNS
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not
cut.
RIDDICK
(agreeing)
No. She's not.
It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey.
AUDREY
(confessing)
I didn't want you to leave me there...
back at the ship...that's why I didn't
say anything....
FRY
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you
shoulda told me sooner.
JOHNS
(finally getting it)
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
RIDDICK
They been nose-open for her ever since we
left. They go off blood.
IMAM
Well...we must keep her close, then.
Here, she'll be safe if we put her
between --
RIDDICK
(scanning)
There is no "safe."
An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears
fill with CANYON SOUNDS.
FRY
It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.
Johns brays.
JOHNS
Hey, you're the one who got me out here,
turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An'
now you 'spect me to go back like a
whipped dog?
FRY
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay?
Now let's just go back to the ship.
JOHNS
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces --
you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out
here.
FRY
Are you fucking high again? Just listen
to --
JOHNS
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be
afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of
meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say
mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred
meters, after that we're in Skiff City!
So why don't you just butch up, stuff a
cork in that kid, and get --
IMAM
She's the captain, we should listen to --
JOHNS
Listen to her? Her? When she was willing
to sacrifice us all?
A beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't.
AUDREY
What's he talkin' about?
JOHNS
During the crash, she --
FRY
(a warning growl)
This does not help us, Johns.
JOHNS
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking
passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
FRY
Just shut up, okay?
JOHNS
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris
had it right -- we are disposable. We're
just walking ghosts to her.
FRY
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside.
JOHNS
We're not alive because of her -- we're
alive in spite of her.
He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes,
her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down.
FRY
We cannot go through there....
JOHNS
(lording)
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
IMAM
(pushing him back)
Fine, fine, you've made your point. We
can all be so scared as you.
Johns snatches a light away from Imam.
JOHNS
(to all)
Verdict's in. The light moves forward.
They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run.
At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now
draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead...
Johns falls in step with Riddick.
JOHNS
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
RIDDICK
Just realized that, huh?
CLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound
away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge.
JOHNS
Six of us left. If we could get through
that canyon and lose just one, that'd be
quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing,
right?
RIDDICK
Not if I'm the one.
JOHNS
What if you're one of five?
Riddick stares. "I'm listening."
AUDREY
What're they doin' up there?
IMAM
Talking about the canyon, I suppose.
How to get us through.
Overhearing, Fry looks. It's odd to see Johns and Riddick
walking side by side, like equals. Like partners.
JOHNS
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no
different than those battlefield doctors
when they have to decide who lives and who
dies. It's called "triage," okay?
RIDDICK
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
JOHNS
Either way, figure it's something you can
grab onto.
RIDDICK
(doping it out)
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave
it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket
of chum.
JOHNS
Trawl with it. There's a cable on the
sled. We can drag the body behind us.
RIDDICK
Nice embellishment.
JOHNS
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just
keep 'em off our scent.
RIDDICK
(looking back)
So which one caught your eye?
JOHNS
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
Fry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look.
FRY
Imam. Slow down.
IMAM
What?
FRY
Don't stop, just slow down.
Little more
space 'tween us and them.
IMAM
I would rather we all stay--
FRY
Do what I say. Please.
RIDDICK
What's her name, anyway?
JOHNS
What do you care?
Riddick shrugs. "I don't."
JOHNS
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving
turkey, okay? I assume you still got a
shiv.
RIDDICK
What, you 'spect me to do it?
JOHNS
What's one more to you? Like this is the
one that sends you to Hell?
RIDDICK
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They
oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere.
Or forget the museum -- maybe they should
just hang you.
As Fry and the others keep slowing.
JOHNS
Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the
others off your back.
Riddick stops. Reconsiders.
JOHNS (CONT'D)
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
RIDDICK
(shakes head)
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger
piece of chum.
JOHNS
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new
partnership splintering apart: "Like Mr. Johns."
Riddick makes a play for the shotgun. It BLASTS skyward.
As the fight erupts:
FRY
Bring the light!
AUDREY
What're they doing? What're we --
FRY
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of
illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick
and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE
CLICKING AWAY.
The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it
into the night. And then pulls his shiv.
RIDDICK
Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's
the only rule.
Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts
poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark.
Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club.
Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two
cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,
forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns
makes a desperate lunge for the light, but...
Riddick shivs open his back.
RIDDICK
Remember that moment?
Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
Riddick dogs him.
RIDDICK
Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns.
You were one brave fuck, before. Now look
at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass
with your gauge...with your chains....
Johns finds the shotgun. "And I'm still Billy Bad-ass." He
sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill...
Blackness. Where'd Riddick go?
CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...
Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the
night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his
head, he whirls again and takes aim on...
Another bull-rushing predator.
Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the
shotgun for another try. He's too late.
BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red.
Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.
RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator
lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle
CLICKING-COOING SOUND.
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.
RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams
forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade,
splitting him in two.
Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1. They're running, stumbling,
trying to backtrack the sled marks. Checking for pursuit, Fry
looks over her shoulder...
And crashes into Riddick. He was just standing in the dark,
waiting for them.
RIDDICK
Back to the ship, huh?
FRY
Get out of our way.
RIDDICK
So everybody huddles together till the
lights burn out? Until you can't see
what's eating you? That the big plan?
IMAM
Where's Mr. Johns?
RIDDICK
Which half?
IMAM
You mean....
Conflicted, they all look back. Audrey starts to puddle up.
AUDREY
Gonna lose everybody out here....
RIDDICK
He died fast. And if we got any choice,
that's the way we should all go out.
(to Audrey, softly)
Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
BLACK SCREEN. We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING...
BATTLING BONE-BLADES...MATING CRIES...the RENDING OF FLESH
and SNAPPING OF TENDON. Far below, twin flames appear as the
survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND,
just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.
They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1.
CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON. There must be
countless predators ahead.
FRY
How many you see?
RIDDICK
One or two.
FRY
Audrey?
AUDREY
Three full bottles. But almost time to
refill.
FRY
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,
does it?
RIDDICK
Only see one way. Turn the sled over and
drag it like that, girl down low. Light
up everything we got -- and run through
like dogs on fire.
A beat.
IMAM
(understanding)
The sled as a shield....
FRY
And what about the cells?
RIDDICK
I'll take those.
She looks at him hard.
FRY
We're just here to carry your light,
aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
RIDDICK
Let's drop back an' boot up.
START on the power cells. They're been lashed together into one
queue.
Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from
the old straps. Close behind him, Imam is MUTTERING IN ARABIC.
RIDDICK
What're you doin'?
IMAM
Blessing you like the others.
(off his look)
It's painless.
RIDDICK
And pointless.
IMAM
(a beat)
I see. Well, even if you don't believe
in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
RIDDICK
You don't see.
Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.
RIDDICK (CONT'D)
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in
lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth
and not believe. And you surely don't
start out in a liquor store trash bin with
an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck
and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe
in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
IMAM
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
RIDDICK
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs
a spare.
The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop.
Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a
torch.
Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.
Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a
metal carapace.
Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will
surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through.
RIDDICK
As fast as you can.
FRY
You sure you can keep --
RIDDICK
As fast as you can.
SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield
fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along
behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already
tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,
flank them in fire.
As predators launch from the rim.
First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --
then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next
come FERAL SOUNDS overhead.
RIDDICK
Don't look.
Thin blue liquid spatters them.
RIDDICK
Do not look up.
More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...
A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and
weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND
OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry
eels.
RIDDICK
Keep going, keep going, keep going,
keep going!
His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry
keeps her eyes down and speed up.
More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?
IMAM
(a muttered mantra)
"So dark the clouds around my way
I cannot see,
But through the darkness I believe
God leadeth me.
I gladly place my hand in His when
all is dim,
And, closing my weary eyes, lean
hard on him...."
Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims
of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly
mess.
Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,
drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.
The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.
FRY
Riddick? RIDDICK?
Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.
AUDREY
What? What is it?
RIDDICK
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!
GO OVER IT!
Steeling themselves, they start climbing.
But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her
hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...
One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...
And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.
PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10
different predators.
FRY
Audrey!
Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...
A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing
the metal...
And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.
Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
to rip free of the shield.
Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.
The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...
Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the
beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator
CLICKS MADLY at him.
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.
The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with
its skull-blade.
Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...
...yanks his shiv...
...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the
predator falls, disemboweled.
REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.
RIDDICK
Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.
They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one
person short.
IMAM
Suleiman!
RIDDICK
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
IMAM
SULEIMAN!
RIDDICK
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by
unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes
a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone
again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out
of existence.
They flail on. And now, finally...finally....
The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The
WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened
faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh
Circle of Hell. But then...
The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.
Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.
Blood falls anew.
One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.
Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this
blood has no hue.
FRY
Oh, no. No, no, no....
IMAM
Rain.
RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and
ground.
Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch
goes out -- and won't relight.
RIDDICK
So where the hell's God now, huh?
(no answer from Imam)
I'll tell you where! He's up there
PISSING ON ME!
FRY
Riddick? How close?
Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. We don't know what he
sees -- nor what he's thinking.
FRY
Tell me the settlement is right there!
RIDDICK, PLEASE!
RIDDICK
We can't make it.
HOLD on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.
Somewhere behind, the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN.
RIDDICK
Here...hide here....
He's found a crevice in the canyon wall.
RIDDICK
Inside...inside....
They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.
There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his
back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over
to the crevice...
...and slide it over the opening. A black beat.
AUDREY
(a beat)
Why's he still out there?
Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them?
Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.
He stops at the top, peers through the rain.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement.
Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow,
slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.
AUDREY
He's not coming back, is he?
Fry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?" Imam
wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see
his face.
FRY
There's light in here.
It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover
small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few.
FRY
What are they?
CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life.
IMAM
Larva....
AUDREY
Glow worms....
FRY
(mind racing)
How many bottles we got? Empty ones?
CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms.
AUDREY
More, more, we need more....
They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their
world.
Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,
looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision?
Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...
Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and
closes the hatch behind him.
Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's
Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she
spies...
The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light.
As the skiffs ENGINES WARM UP.
As Fry, running, splashes past buildings.
Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is
all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the
shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He
can't see much until...
A blade rushes through the hole. Imam recoils hard, snatches up
the glow-worm light to see...
More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The
light drives them away. For now.
They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain,
Riddick in the light.
RIDDICK
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in
a woman.
FRY
You're not leaving. Not until we go back
for the others.
He laughs at that.
FRY (CONT'D)
I promised them we'd go back with more
light. And that's exactly what we're
gonna do..
RIDDICK
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who
gives a fuck.
FRY
What, you're afraid?
RIDDICK
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was
his monkey. I only deal in life and
death. All that stuff in between? Some
shade of grey my eyes don't see.
FRY
I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I
trusted that some part of you wanted to
rejoin the human race.
RIDDICK
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With
desperation edging her voice:
FRY
Then wait for me. I'll go back myself.
Just give me more light for them.
He tosses her a light. The broken one.
FRY
Just come with me!
RIDDICK
Got a better idea. Come with me.
Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.
RIDDICK (CONT'D)
They're already dead. Get on board.
FRY
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
RIDDICK
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't
leave you here. If you believe anything
about me, better be that.
FRY
No, you see, I promised them...I have
to...I have to go and....
She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it --
and he keeps slashing away.
RIDDICK
Step aboard, Carolyn.
FRY
(tortured)
I can't....I can't....
RIDDICK
(approaching, extending
a hand)
Here. Make it easy on you.
FRY
Don't do this to me....
RIDDICK
Just give me your hand.
FRY
But they...they could still be....
RIDDICK
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my
hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway.
They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.
FRY
I will not give up on them! I Will not
leave anyone on this rock with those
fucking things, even if it means --
In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is
history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely
calm. Curious. Even gentle.
RIDDICK
You'd die for them?
FRY
I would try for them.
RIDDICK
You barely know them.
FRY
But I'm human. I know you view that as a
weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear,
theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes.
I would die for them.
MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready
to do battle with...
Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.
AUDREY
(big-eyed)
You came for us....
RIDDICK
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed.
Anyone not ready for this?
Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four
remaining survivors head out.
RIDDICK
Tighter, tighter....
RIDDICK
Stop.
They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.
FRY
I don't hear --
He covers her mouth.
RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise.
A predator drinks there.
RIDDICK
(on his breath)
Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....
RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another.
Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major
gathering place.
Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare
is far from over.
RIDDICK
Get behind me.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the
pool. A slim gap appears.
RIDDICK
When I go, we go. Full-throttle.
CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.
RIDDICK
Ready...ready....
RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage.
A gauntlet within a gauntlet.
Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its
shoulder.
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.
The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing
through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to
reach...
The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...
And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...
Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles
her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her
slip-sliding down the other side.
RIDDICK
You know the way!
Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the
rise at us.
Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.
RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.
PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing Riddick.
Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a
corner and see...
The light of the skiff.
RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey
vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we
follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly
a predator is right there, right in our face.
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look
up.
RIDDICK'S POV: Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the
building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.
PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs. Bracing
himself. Ready to blade it out.
Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the
headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.
Waiting.
IMAM
Captain....
He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes
sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for
Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator:
There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there.
Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...
And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...
A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots...
Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to
fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him.
Around them both.
FRY
It's me, it's me, it's me!
She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face
clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry
grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.
FRY
C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them,
not you.
He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start
moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the
predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.
FRY
Just 10 steps...keep turning, keep
turning...that's right...others're already
'board, waitin' for us right now...five
steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick...
almost there...we're almost --
Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.
EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got
slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?
RIDDICK
Not for me....
In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no
scream. No cry. No final words. Just...
Blackness.
Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It
resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits
escape velocity.
The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet. Its
light feels cleansing. Renewing. Life-giving.
