      Pressed tightly inside the car, Allison draws Scott closer. 
      Hands pulling her shirt up, they kiss ever more urgently as--

      GLASS EXPLODES inside the car, raining down on them. Allison 
      screams as something YANKS Scott through the window.


      Allison s bedroom window. Tumbling across the floor, Scott 
      rolls to a breathless stop at her feet. He peers up at her 
      with a sly grin.

                    They ll be gone an hour.*

      And not a second later, they're falling lip-locked onto her 
      bed, tearing at each other's clothes with the carelessness of 
      a teenage couple far too much in love.

        A helium-filled balloon with a Get Well message on it hangs 
      gently in the air. The hand grasping the string belongs to 
      Stiles who slumps on a waiting room couch, passed out.*

      Scott s mother, Melissa McCall, watches Stiles with an amused 
      smile. Then turns back to an open room where--*


      A bleary-eyed Lydia struggles out of bed. Her father steps *
      over to assist her.

      Closing Lydia s door behind him, Mr. Martin notices Stiles in 
      the waiting room and turns to Melissa.

                                  MR. MARTIN
                    He s been here all night?

      A CLEANING LADY bends down to empty a trash can near Stiles.

                    You... you re dirty.

      The Cleaning Lady pops up with a bewildered look.


      Scott and Allison collide with her dresser, sending a LAMP *
      CRASHING to the floor amid their clothes.*

                    Sorry.*

      She laughs, kissing him as they fall back to the bed. Covers *
      twisting around them, Allison s hands reach down his lower *
      back, pulling him closer as her bare legs slide up, *
        intertwining with his when--*

      They slip right off the side of the bed, tumbling to the *
      floor.*

                    That was your fault.*

                    Then we re dead.

      Allison hears the ROAR of a car pulling into the driveway. 
      Scott leaps up, grabbing his clothes.*

                    Oh my God, hurry, hurry.

      They scramble furiously to gather any evidence of his being 
      there when the bedroom door SWINGS OPEN. 

      Victoria Argent steps in. Allison innocently looks up from 
      her bed where she casually reads a book. Alone.

                      happiness. My will to live.*

      She glances nervously at the broken lamp beside her dresser *
      as Victoria holds up a BLACK DRESS in dry cleaning plastic.*

      Her mother yanks the closet doors open. Finding nothing 
      unusual, she hangs the dress while past her--*


      Lydia yanks the shower curtain open and turns on the water. 
      Slipping off the hospital gown, she steps in under the 
      steaming spray.

      While gently gliding her fingers over the still healing BITE *
      in her side, she does not notice--*

      WATER gathering in the tub at her feet as if the drain were 
      clogged. Strangely murky and rising steadily.


      Outside Lydia's room, both her father and Melissa have 
      stepped away. 

      Down the corridor, Stiles drops change into a VENDING 
      MACHINE. Selecting a candy bar, he waits for it to come *
      tumbling down. But, of course, it gets stuck.

                                  STILES
                      Seriously?

      He taps on the plexiglass window of the machine. The candy 
      bar doesn t budge. So he gives the glass a SMACK. Nothing. He *
      pounds on it with a fist. Still nothing.


      Under the shower s spray, Lydia closes her eyes, unaware that *
      far too much water gathers in the tub, rising over her feet 
      and then to her ankles.


      Stiles spreads his legs for maximum leverage and awkwardly *
      grips the sides of the vending machine to shake the candy bar 
      loose.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/117.

                        Son-of-a-freaking...

      Muttering in irrational fury, he rocks the machine back and *
      forth. Just as the candy bar is almost slipping free--*

      The entire vending machine lurches forward and SLAMS down 
      onto the floor with a THUNDERING CRASH.

      Stiles freezes. He stares down at the very heavy machine now 
      laying on its face right in front of him.


      Having heard the crash, Lydia pulls her head out from the 
      shower. Hearing nothing else, she finally notices the water *
      in the tub has risen past her ankles.

      With an irritated sigh, she kicks a toe at the drain. But the *
      water keeps rising.

      Kneeling down, Lydia reaches into the dirty water with her *
      fingers and slowly pulls up a thin clump of sinewy BLACK *
      HAIR.

      Gagging in disgust as the strands wrap around her fingers, 
      she keeps pulling, digging. Then just as it seems she's *
      grasped the extent of it...

      There appears to be more in the drain. Much more.

      Grasping thick tufts of dirt-caked hair, she keeps pulling, *
      water darkening to black as an impossible sight rises up from 
      the depths--

      THE HEAD OF A WOLF. 

      Its dead eyes gaze up at Lydia who lets loose a torrent of *
      SCREAMING.


      Stiles snaps his attention from the vending machine when he 
      hears the panicked SHRIEKING. He scrambles over the downed 
      machine, launching himself down the hall.

                    What the hell was that?

      They gather at the open bathroom door to find the empty 
      shower still running, water flowing off the side of the tub.*

      Window up, the curtains flutter. But there s no sign of *
      Lydia.

      She's gone.


      Melissa and Mr. Martin follow Sheriff Stilinski and a DEPUTY *

      He retreats back, slipping around a confused cluster of 
      HOSPITAL WORKERS staring at a downed VENDING MACHINE.


      In the hospital parking lot, Stiles jumps behind the wheel of 
      his Jeep. Scott sits up in the passenger seat as Stiles hands

                    she s not the one who s going to

                    You got it backwards, McCall. When 
                    I was with Lydia, you should have 
                    seen the scratch marks she left on 
                    me. What do you think she s going 
                    to do with a set of real claws?

      Mr. Harris looks up from his desk.

                    This is a pop quiz, Mr. Stilinski.

                    tempted to give you detention for

                    you at three for detention.

      Stiles turns to Scott, opening his mouth in shock.

                    You too, Mr. McCall?

                                  SCOTT
                    No, sir.

      Nearby, Jackson smirks at them. Then turns back to his own 
      test where he notices--

      A BLACK SPOT on the sheet of paper. It looks like pen ink. He 
      touches it with his finger, smearing it. And then another 
      SPOT appears.

      His best friend, Danny, taps him.

                                  DANNY
                    Dude. Your nose.

      Lifting his head up, Jackson touches underneath his nose, 
      just above the lip. He pulls his fingers away to find a 
      strange black fluid on the tips.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Are you okay?

      But the black liquid drips from his nose over his lip. The 
      same exact black blood that Derek and Scott once bled.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1125.



      Locking himself in one of the stalls, he grabs a stream of 
      toilet paper, trying to staunch the flow.

      In mere moments, however, the paper is soaked. Dropping it 
      into the toilet, he grabs another handful. Then does it 
      again, and again.

      A KNOCK on the stall door.

                                    JACKSON
                    I m fine, Danny. Go back to class.

      But he keeps pulling tissue paper, almost the entire roll as 
      the toilet itself begins to fill.

      A HAND POUNDS on the stall door. More urgent.*

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Just give me a second.

      Frantic, Jackson keeps wiping at the blood. Flushing the *
      toilet, he grabs more and more paper as SOMEONE HAMMERS on 
      the door.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    I said give me a freaking second, 
                    all right?

      With a METALLIC CRUNCH the lock SNAPS and the door whips 
      open. A powerful hand yanks Jackson out of the stall, 
      pressing him up against the bathroom sinks.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Derek?

      He gazes at Derek Hale, astonished. The blood is now clear of 
      Jackson s face, skin rubbed raw by tissue paper. Derek 
      glances to the stall. Nothing there as well.

                                  DEREK
                    You re looking pale, Jackson. You

                    Never better.

      He shrugs free of Derek s grip.

      Jackson notices Derek s eyes have turned to the mirror. He 
      follows his gaze and in the reflection, Jackson sees a drip 
      of inky BLACK BLOOD slipping out of his ear down his neck.

      Derek grabs him by the chin, pulling his face to the side to 
      get a better look. Then he grabs one of Jackson s hands to 
      see the BLACK STAINS on his fingers.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)

                    Why?

      Equally disturbed by the sight, Derek looks him in the eye.

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know.

      Jackson puts a hand to his ear. It comes away dripping with 
      the strange black liquid.

                    What is it?

      But Derek just backs away, slowly shaking his head. As he

      FADE IN:


      Under the CLANG of the end of day BELL, Allison takes her 
        plastic-covered black funeral dress from her locker. Then 
      notices something wedged into one of the locker s vents.*

      A NOTE. She pulls it out, unfolding it to find a short but 
      meaningful message: Because I love you.*

      DOWN THE CORRIDOR - Scott watches her read the note. Clearly 
      pleased by the reaction it draws, he retreats back around the 
      corner so as not to be seen by any witnesses.

      When Allison closes her locker, a handsome teenager named 
      MATT smiles at her. His own locker next to hers, he slides an 
      expensive professional digital CAMERA back into its case.

      Allison SLAMS her locker closed, silencing them. But only for 
      a moment. Titters of suppressed laughter send Allison 
      hurrying down the corridor, almost breaking into a run.

      UNTIL SOMEONE GRABS HER, pulling her into--

      Scott opens the door. As Allison steps out she lets her hand 
      rest over his on the edge of the door. Their fingers 
      intertwine for the briefest moment.

      When they break apart, Scott closes the door, leaning against 
      it as if pressed back by worry. He glances up at the CLOCK 
      which reads--


      3:59. Below the clock, Mr. Harris grades papers while Stiles 
      sits at a desk trying to will the clock hands to move faster. 
      Finally, the hour hand hits 4 and Stiles jumps up.

      Harris says his name with barely concealed hatred as he 
      approaches to look down on him.

                                  DEPUTY (V.O.)
                    Copy. I m--I m standing in front of 
                    it now. Something got in the back.

      Scott and Stiles glance at each other, both now listening 
      intently.

                                  DEPUTY (V.O.)
                    There s blood everywhere. And I *
                    mean, everywhere.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Copy that, Unit Four. What s your 
                    twenty? 

                                  DEPUTY (V.O.)
                    Route five and Post. I swear, I ve 
                    never seen anything like this.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I m on my way.

      Stilinski drops the radio back.

                    As for you two--

      But his backseat doors lie wide open. Both Stiles and Scott *
      are long gone.

      FADE IN:


        A shivering, sickly Jackson turns over in bed. He pulls a *
      tissue from his nose, dripping with BLACK BLOOD.

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    Because I don t care if it s 
                    wounded and weak...

      The tissue falls to a pile on the floor, a veritable mountain 
      of them soaked with the strange black fluid.   TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1142.

                    Or if it s seemingly harmless...


      A troubled Scott gathers Allison into his arms as they sit 
      together on a rock face overlooking the light-dappled town.

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    Begging for its life with a promise 
                    that it would never, ever hurt 
                    anyone...


      A nervous Isaac steps into a dark and decrepit underground 
      railway station that has been long since abandoned.*

                                  GERARD (V.O.)

                    soul with no idea what he s getting 
                    into...

      Isaac raises a flashlight beam to illuminate Derek Hale.
