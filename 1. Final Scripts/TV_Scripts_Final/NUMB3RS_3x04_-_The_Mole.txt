  INT. HOLLYWOOD NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT22

  Waiters navigate through the chic and elite.  At the bar, we 
  find MICHELLE KIM, Chinese-American, mid-twenties, sexy jeans 
  and top.  Think Lucy Liu.  Establish ND Bartender in b.g.,

  Michelle looks at her watch, checks the door.  A moment 
  later, her cell phone rings... She answers.  A beat before 
  she snaps the phone shut, pays her tab and leaves. 

  EXT. NIGHTCLUB - MOMENTS LATER33

  Michelle chirps her '06 Corolla, when...

  A set of headlights find her... 

  Michelle turns, the lights are BLINDING...

  WHAM! A SUV SLAMS into her... Michelle's body sails like a 
  doll.

  Off her lifeless body -- the tail lights of the fleeing SUV 
  in the distance -- 

  EXT. NIGHTCLUB - CRIME SCENE - NIGHT44

  Block is taped off on both ends. LAPD black and whites on the 
  outside.  Inside are all FBI s crime techs/ERT.

  DON works his way through the crowd and is met by COLBY, who 
  holds Kim s wallet.

                              COLBY
                Victim s Michelle Kim.
                      (shows Driver s License)
                Used to look like this.

  Don takes the wallet... then flips through it. 

  INSERT PHOTO -- Kim and her parents, a girl (cousin), dog.

                              DON
                So, why d LAPD call us?

                              COLBY
                She worked for the Chinese 
                  Consulate.  You know how that 
                goes... They ll have her apartment 
                cleaned out fifteen minutes after 
                they find out she s dead.

                              DAVID
                What d she do?

                              COLBY
                She was an Interpreter.

                              DON
                      (then)
                What do witnesses say?

                              DAVID 
                Hit and run.  One describes a 
                Tahoe, another says it was an 
                  Explorer.

                              COLBY
                Must be a dozen bars in a three 
                block area.  Figure a D-U-I.  Hits 
                her, panics, speeds away.

                              DON
                      (figuring facts)
                What do you make it?  Ninety feet 
                to the body?

                              DAVID
                      (checks his notes)
                  Ninety-eight.

  Don kneels down, lights the ground with his Surefire. 

                              COLBY
                See something?

                              DON
                No skid marks. 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #305/42   "The Mole"   2nd WHITE Rev   9-07-06    3.

  Don then shines his light along other cars... 

                              DON (CONT'D)
                And no damage to any other cars.

                              COLBY
                Lucky drunk. 

                              DAVID
                Tell her that.

  Off Michelle s body -- 

  INT. CALSCI - CHARLIE S OFFICE - NIGHT55

  Two plates of home made chocolate chip cookies. Charlie bites 
  one, then scribbles on the board. He doesn't notice AMITA.

                              AMITA
                They say there's nothing sexier 
                than a man who knows how to cook. 

                              CHARLIE
                And what do you say?

                              AMITA
                I like guys who are good at math.

                              CHARLIE
                      (smiles)
                Actually, I m using differential 
                geometry to perfect the Chocolate 
                Chip cookie.

                              AMITA
                This is in case the whole genius 
                thing doesn't work out?

                              CHARLIE
                It's for  Senior Ditch Day. 

                              AMITA
                More like Senior  Beach Day. 

                              CHARLIE
                While they re away, the 
                  underclassmen go crazy.  Last year 
                my office was ransacked.

                              AMITA
                So this year...

                              CHARLIE
                I leave a peace offering for the 
                hungry natives.

                              AMITA
                      (bites one)
                Needs bigger chips.
                      (then)
                So I guess congratulations are in 
                order.

                              CHARLIE
                For?

  Holds up a copy of Physics Weekly.  We see the masthead. 
  Professor Larry Fleinhardt s name.

                              AMITA
                Bit controversial but I like it. 
                Larry used nonstandard analysis 
                instead of the conventional Borel 
                approach in treating the 
                  singularities.

                              CHARLIE
                      (reads)
                Larry published an article on Zero 
                Point Energy and quantum cosmology?

                              AMITA
                You didn t know?
                      (off Charlie)
                  I figured Larry would have had you 
                  collaborate.

                              CHARLIE
                Me too. 

  Off Charlie, a little surprised.

                Better alert the locals.  If that 
                SUV s stolen, it s gonna get dumped

                Looks like Michelle Kim moved back 
                and forth between here and China 
                growing up. 

  Colby comes around.

                              COLBY
                We got an FBI file on her?

                              DAVID
                Her father.  Former Chinese 
                  Diplomat.  Retired in  97.  FBI 
                Counter Intelligence ran a 
                  background check on her when she 
                moved back to the States in  03.  

                              COLBY
                Counter Intelligence?  Why were 
                they looking at her?

  David shrugs.

                Well, since I m the one with access 
                to the NSA, I think that actually 
                makes me the big brother.

  Charlie notices the file.

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                New case? 

                              DON
                Hit and run.  But I m thinking it 
                may be something more.

                              CHARLIE
                  Something more like what?

                              DON
                Like maybe it was intentional.

                              CHARLIE
                Want me to take a look?

                              DON

                Well, I seriously doubt your guys 
                are going to factor in steady-
                motion regimes, or a body stiffness 
                  coefficient, not to mention subtle 
                body undulations generated by the 
                  ground-reaction force.

                              DON
                Body undulations?

                              CHARLIE
                Was she walking or standing still? 
                How fast was she moving?  Once you 
                have that data,
                      (re: photo)
                These impact marks on her body can 
                tell you a lot... It really 
                wouldn t be a problem for me to--

                Hey, I thought I was being nice.  
                You want, knock yourself out.

                breaking orbit, developing an

  INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - LATE DAY1313

  Don and Megan talk with KAJ-JAN CHEN, Americanized.

                              CHEN
                I ve been cleared by my Ambassador 
                to cooperate in any way... I ve 
                also notified Ms. Kim s parents in 
                Beijing... You can imagine how 
                difficult a call that was to make. 

                              MEGAN
                We hope you expressed our 
                  sympathies.

                              CHEN
                To have a child taken from you at 
                such great distance... But I 
                suppose a traffic accident can 
                occur anywhere in the world.

                              DON
                We re not sure it was an accident.

                              CHEN
                I don t understand.

                              DON
                Her job was as an interpreter...

                              CHEN
                That s right.

                              DON
                Any reason she might have large 
                sums of cash in her bank account?

                              CHEN
                Her personal finances wouldn t be 
                  something I would have any 
                  knowledge about.

                              MEGAN
                So that would be a  no. 

                              CHEN
                I m afraid I didn t really know her 
                very well... 

                              DON
                Then you won t mind providing a 
                list of people she worked with.

                              DAVID
                What d the Consulate General say?

                              MEGAN
                That he didn t know her very well.

                              DAVID
                      (joking)
                Well, he s either telling the truth 
                or the Chinese have a pretty 
                liberal hiring policy... 

                              DON
                What s up?

                              DAVID
                Credit card had a bunch of charges 
                to night clubs, lingerie shops and 
                the occasional  adult  store.

                              MEGAN
                Not exactly the image her neighbors 
                  painted...

                              DON
                Run her with LAPD Vice.  Narco too.  
                See what else she was hiding.

                              MEGAN
                We still don t know if this girl 
                was even murdered.

  Charlie enters --

                              CHARLIE
                  Actually, we do.  As promised, I 
                have your answer about whether this 
                was an accident. 

                              DON
                Charlie, what d you skip classes?





                                                                          (CONTINUED)    NUMB3RS   #305/42   "The Mole"   2nd WHITE Rev   9-07-06    17.

                have a sandwich or something?

                              DON
                We ll send out.  What do you got?

  Charlie starts to hook up his laptop.

                              CHARLIE
                Well, at first I was using a steady 
                motion algorithm to try to 
                  determine the victim s movement at 
                impact.  But my results were 
                  inconclusive.

                              DAVID
                But you persevered. 

  Charlie walks and imitates the motion he describes.

                              CHARLIE
                  I imagined walking... the motion of 
                her feet... Then it became obvious, 
                curtate cycloid.

                              MEGAN
                Curtate cycloid, of course.

                              CHARLIE
                Think of someone s stride like the 
                moon orbiting around the Earth...

  AUDIENCE VISION --

  We see an animated moon...

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                As the moon moves around the Earth 
                and the Earth moves around the sun, 
                the moon traces out a curtate 
                cycloid curve in space.

  The moon spins and circles the Earth...

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                When you walk it s really a series 
                of little circles rotating inside a 
                larger circle.

  An animated heel swings on an arc past the knee....




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    NUMB3RS   #305/42   "The Mole"   2nd WHITE Rev   9-07-06    18.

                              CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                The heel orbiting backward, then 
                forward past the knee is a small 
                circle within the larger circle of 
                  walking...

  RESUME SCENE

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                From there, I could probabilistically 
                  determine the leg motion of your 
                victim at the point of impact.

                              MEGAN
                And this helps us how?

                              CHARLIE
                The marks on her legs that the 
                  vehicle s lights made, they re 
                high.

                              DON
                High?

                              CHARLIE
                The bumper of the vehicle was 
                rising on impact.

                               DON
                So, the car was accelerating.

                              MEGAN
                Which means this was no accident.

                              MEGAN
                Nowhere.  All the deposits were 
                made in cash.  Each one just below 
                the 10 grand threshold for 
                reporting to the IRS.

                Dwayne Carter.  Says Kim s 
                background check was routine.

                              DON
                Yeah, well, there s nothing routine 
                about a 24 year old interpreter 
                with that kind of money.

  Colby walks in holding an evidence bag, access card inside.

                Or to her apartment.  I used a set 
                of keys we found in her purse when 
                I went over the other night.

  INT. CALSCI - CHARLIE S OFFICE -  DAY1818

  Charlie and Larry work on the photo images (Asian women).  On 
  an LCD monitor (on cart/wires hanging) are the various 
  algorithms.

                              CHARLIE
                It s ironic that a naked woman s 
                photograph could hold technology 
                that might allow another nation the 
                ability to penetrate our defense. 

                              LARRY
                You d be surprised at the damage 
                I ve seen a naked woman do.
                      (off his look)
                Don t ask me Charles because I am 
                not telling.

  Then,

                              LARRY (CONT'D)
                What amazes me is that they re 
                hiding their messages using the 
                  encryption programs privacy groups 
                hired us to develop.

  Larry looks at the codes on the chalk board and computer.

                              LARRY (CONT D)
                When I was a child I read that the 
                KGB and CIA used to send coded 
                messages via shortwave radio. 

                              CHARLIE
                  I thought I was the only one...

                              LARRY
                I d listen to people talking, in 
                  languages I didn t understand, 
                  imagining an operative in Paris or 
                Germany.  I even tried sending my 
                own secret messages in response.

                              CHARLIE
                I never thought of doing that.

                              LARRY
                Then one day the police stopped by.

                              CHARLIE
                Police?

                It was refreshing to see your sense 
                of humor that day Charles. Up until 
                then I was afraid your intensity 
                might also be your undoing.

                              CHARLIE
                So it wasn t just about IQ s?

  A beat.  Then more serious.

                              LARRY
                I knew your style of analysis would 
                fit well with my supergravity work.

                              CHARLIE
                You make it sound like something s 
                changed?

                              LARRY
                Your passion has blossomed into so 
                many avenues, your work with Don, 
                your convergence theory...

                Hey.  My program s getting 
                  something here...

  The eyebrow area enlarges in steps...

                She was killed in an accident.

                                HECTOR
                Wow.  That s horrible.

                Do you know how long she lived 
                here?

                                HECTOR 
                Two years.  Give or take.

  Colby looks at the security cameras.

                              COLBY
                You keep tapes for those cameras?

                It s all digital.  Footage gets

  alone... notes the time, watches her talk quickly to Hector 
  and proceed...

  He speeds forward... concentrating... watching nameless, 
  faceless people go by... Then, something catches Colby s eye -
  - he stops the tape.

  ON MONITOR -- the frozen image of a man... ballcap, t-shirt, 
  jeans... obscuring himself from the camera s view... Colby 
  zooms in tight.  Focusing not on the man s face but on the  
  man s back, a pair of shades dangling from the t-shirt s

                Don, if she bought someone off for 
                the Chinese or North Koreans, then 
                Michelle Kim was a spy.

                And someone on our side sold out.

                And if the Chinese have somebody 
                inside DOJ...

                              DAVID
                Then they can get to any witness 
                they want... any case they want.

2323INT. FBI - GARAGE - DAY 

  BURN IN: Dwayne Carter about to get into his car.  Colby 
  surprises him.

                              CARTER
                Man Granger, you scared the crap 
                out of me.

                              COLBY
                So you haven t seen Michelle Kim in 
                two years.

                              CARTER
                Already told you that. 

  Colby pulls out a photo image from the security tape footage.

                              COLBY
                Tell me again.
                      (off Carter)
                Boot camp they teach you to put 
                your shades on your back when you

                      (admitting it s him)
                Guess old habits die hard...

  Colby knew, but didn t really know until that moment.  

                              COLBY
                I oughta bust your ass right now 
                for lying to me.

                              CARTER 
                Look, she approached me about a 
                year after I did the background 
                check.  We ended up sleeping 
                together.  But that s it.

                              COLBY
                Why the hell didn t you tell me 
                this from the get go?

                              CARTER
                Why do you think I didn t tell you?   
                I work Counter Intelligence.  I m 
                supposed to be following people 
                like Kim.

                              COLBY
                So you knew she was a spy?

                                CARTER
                I had a pretty good idea.  

                              COLBY
                How about an idea to kill witnesses 
                who would testify against a 
                fugitive on the U.S. Marshals 10 
                Most Wanted list.

                                CARTER
                      (surprised)
                You think I had something to do 
                with that?

                              COLBY
                What do you expect me to think?

  Carter looks away, then decides to tell his story.

                                CARTER
                When I came back from Afghanistan, 
                things with me and Jennie went 
                south quick.  I ended up living in 
                a studio apartment, with some judge 
                telling me when I could see my kid.
                      (beat)
                After I interviewed Michelle, she 
                called me... We met a couple of 
                more times... She showed me some 
                  attention Granger.  I knew better, 
                but I went for it.  But that s all 
                it was.

                              COLBY
                When s the last time you saw her?

                                CARTER
                Not the night she was killed. 
                      (off Colby)
                Look, this becomes an issue, I ll 
                come clean.  You have my word.
                      (a moment)
                Hey, you d be baked inside a  
                Humvee if it wasn t for me.  You 
                really think I d screw you now?

  Sticks out his fist.  A moment and then Colby hits it.  Ok.    NUMB3RS   #305/42   "The Mole"   2nd WHITE Rev   9-07-06    29B.

                He was a friend, Don.  Guy made a 
                mistake.  It had nothing to do with

  HIGH ANGLE SHOT -- Carter slips off his robe and dives into 
  the swimming pool.  

  INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME3939

  TWO MAINTENANCE people work on an elevator.  It s Megan and 
  David.

                      (watching through window)
                Pecs like that must take a lot of

                And if you d stop staring we might 
                actually be able to get the job 
                done.

  David flips the key and the elevator doors close --

  ON DOORS -- as they open...

  Megan and David walk off...  At Carter s door, David takes 
  out a lock pick.

  INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS4040

  Megan and David get to work... David pulls a "bug" from his 
  bag... Megan finds Carter's laptop. (note: screen saver is of 
  Carter and his son).  David reaches in his pocket takes out a 
  small hard drive. 

  He walks over and plugs it into the laptop.  (note: next to 
  laptop is a photo of Carter and Colby from Afghanistan).  ON 
  SCREEN - contents of Carter's hard drive is transferred.

  Megan looks out the window at the pool... Carter gets out.

                              DAVID

  ON LAPTOP -- still transferring to David s hard drive.

  INT. HALLWAY - SAMEA41A41

  Carter gets off of the elevator... walks to his door, and 
  opens it...

  The place is empty.

  INT. EPPES HOUSE - DAY4141

  Alan approaches the door.

                              ALAN

  Larry enters, fumbles around a bit.

                Can I get you something?

  Larry stops at a picture.  Young Charlie at Princeton.

                              LARRY
                To graduate Princeton at sixteen.  
                I was good, but I had to do it at a 
                normal age, nineteen.

                              ALAN
                That first year we heard a lot 
                about Professor Fleinhardt.

                Charles spent half the time trying 
                to prove the TA's thesis was wrong.

                              ALAN
                Charlie was never afraid to give 
                his opinion.

                              LARRY
                And of course, he was right. 
                      (then)
                You know when Charles came into my 
                life, I saw a student with an 
                  incredible future.

                              ALAN
                Larry, is there something bothering

                  Actually, yes.

  A moment.  Then,

                              LARRY
                Charles is having trouble 
                  understanding why I didn t ask him 
                for help with a paper I published.

                      (feigning ignorance)
                Oh?

                              LARRY 
                It s not that I don t value his 
                input.  He s brilliant.

                              ALAN
                But?

                              LARRY
                In certain binary systems the white  
                dwarf can t help but to take  solar 
                matter  away from the red giant.

                  Eventually the white dwarf has too 
                much matter and becomes unstable. 
                It can no longer survive.
                      (off Alan)
                In my field, Alan, dependence on 
                one person can spell the end of a 
                career.  And frankly, I m not ready 
                to go.

                              ALAN
                There s also something called 
                pride... And I ve never found that 
                to be a great justification for 
                  anything.

                I ve often wondered what 
                  recombination of DNA strands could 
                have created a mind like Charles 
                Eppes... Now it s becoming clear to 
                me.  He had smart parents.

  David hangs up the phone.  Turns to Don and Megan.

  County.  The points are grouped in an area around downtown.

                the seventh branch or Carter s next 
                meeting place be?

  Several more limbs grow with branches.

                Certain factors can eliminate 
                  potential branches. For example, 
                Carter needs to make a fast and 
                clean get away.

                fear of dying.  It s the fear of 
                letting the guys around me down, 
                losing their trust. 

  Colby looks at him.  Then Don hands Colby his badge.

                Next time, you wind up in a jail 
                cell.

  INT. CALSCI - LARRY S OFFICE - DAY5151

  Larry is working hard on untying a Gordian Knot puzzle. 

                              CHARLIE
                See you re still trying to untie 
                yourself.

                              LARRY
                Over sixty precise moves...

                              CHARLIE
                Not called the world s toughest 
                brain teaser for nothing.

                              LARRY
                Once upon a time, I could have done 
                these things in under two minutes.  
                Now, it s over six.

                              CHARLIE
                Still pretty good.

                              LARRY
                Like my paper.

  Long Beat.

                              LARRY (CONT'D)
                Picking Stromsborg as a 
                  collaborator wasn t my strongest 
                option.

                              CHARLIE
                We discussed this, Stromsborg is 
                good --

                              LARRY
                But he s not the best... You see,   
                what I failed to keep in my mind 
                was that the paper meant nothing.  
                It was always the work. 
                      (beat)
                I tried to stop an eclipse.  An 
                eclipse, on my own paper. When what 
                I should have been doing was asking 
                for your collaboration. 
                      (beat)
                So now I am.  If it s not too late.

  Charlie looks at Larry.

                              CHARLIE
                You re not the only one with a 
                  confession to make. 
                      (off Larry)
                I ve already looked at the work.

  Larry shakes his head, smiles.

                              LARRY
                And what have you found?

                              CHARLIE
                You want me to be honest with you?

                              LARRY
                No, I want to remain a blithering 
                idiot.  Of course I want your 
                honesty Charles.

                              CHARLIE
                Larry... I never want to lose you 
                as a friend.

                              LARRY
                And you never shall.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    NUMB3RS   #305/42   "The Mole"   2nd WHITE Rev   9-07-06    62.

                              CHARLIE
                      (beat)
                Your paper is a work of genius.

                              LARRY
                That wasn t so bad.

                              CHARLIE
                But... 

                              LARRY
                Ahh.

                              CHARLIE
                But... it would have benefited from 
                the work of two geniuses.

                              LARRY
                Simon and Garfunkel... 

                              CHARLIE
                Right.  As long as I m Simon. 

                              LARRY
                Ever the pragmatist, Charles.

  Off their smile and back to work --
