      Annie stares straight into the camera. Her eyes are fixed, 
      glazed and empty. One pupil dilated. The paramedics work 
      quickly and efficiently, one pounds her chest, one shines a 
      torch into her eyes. Nothing, no response. The paramedic 
      lifts her head and slips an oxygen mask over her mouth.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    Whether it s at home.

    The pool of blood spreads out from under her head across 
    the wooden floor like a rose blossoming.




      It s like a painting by HieronymusBosch.Blood, mud and 
      body upon body upon body. Mitchell among them. Dead, pale 
    and cold. Just another soldier, just another death.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    There s no getting out of it, no 
                    coming back.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 2.

      Suddenly his body jackknifes and arches. He gasps - huge 
      gulps of air, like someone bursting to the surface from the 
      depths of the ocean. 

    He looks around, shocked, disorientated. The puncture marks 
    on his neck still just about visible.




      Various relatives - Owen among them - stand around the 
      kitchen. All in funeral black. Shocked, mute and awkward. 
      Their grief and bodies too big for the tiny kitchen. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    You can love if you like. 

      Annie stands to one side, looking strangely out of place in 
    her t-shirtand jeans among all the black. She pleads with 
    the people in the kitchen, waves her hands, shouts in their 
      faces. No one sees her, no one hears.




      Mitchell, and a young beautiful woman we will later 
      recognize as Lauren. They are having sex. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    And if you re very lucky you can 
                    beloved.

      Then Mitchell opens his mouth wide. Baring vampire teeth 
      that are long and sharp and wicked. Lauren s body shudders 
    and braces as he bites her. He drinks and drinks.




      Lauren is laying face down on the bed. Eyes open, but dead. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    But everyone gets a death.

      Mitchell is slumped on the floor. Blood on his lips. Tears 
      running down his face. He beats himself with his fists. 
      Whack. Whack.Whack. A slave to his addiction.




    An estate agent shows a young couple - the woman, pregnant -
      around the house. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 3.

      Annie, resigned to her condition now, sits dejectedly on 
    the sofa - her middle finger raised at the trespassers. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    No one told me there was this.

    But it s an empty defeated gesture. The estate agent and 
    the couple, of course, look straight through her.




      A brightly lit private room in a hospital. Sunlight washes 
      across George. He sits in a chair, surrounded by flowers 
    and Get Well cards. But there s something fractured about 
      him. Absent.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    But what s the cost?

      Slowly George stands, walks out.




      George in his hospital porter scrubs. He reads the paper, 
      sips his tea. He picks up a mini packet of biscuits and 
      without taking his eyes from the paper, offers them across 
    to the person sitting next to him. Mitchell.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    And what happens to these 
                    refugees?      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 5.



      Annie looks out of the bedroom window at the street below.

      George and Mitchell are just arriving, bags in hand. George 
      looks up at the house, looks at Annie.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    These flotsam and jetsam of 
                    death.

    He double-takes. Did he see something?

    It makes Annie flinch and move back out of sight. She 
      frowns. That was weird.




      George and Mitchell are in the kitchen. Talking, laughing. 
      George washes up. Mitchell, bored, flicks bubbles at him. 
      George tries to keep his cool, tries not to laugh. Don t do 
      that. I said don t do that. Stop. Please stop. I mean it. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    Maybe, if they still deserve such 
                    a thing as mercy...

      Annie watches them, through the crack in the door. 
      Frightened. Mesmerised.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... they find each other.

    She just watches. And watches.

    AND WE FADE TO:

      BLACK.1515

      Then a sound. The put-put of a moped. A squeak of brakes.


      Annie turns triumphantly to Mitchell and George, who are 
    sat watching TV.A dozen mugs of tea on the table. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 7.

                                    MITCHELL
                    He could so see you.

                    Right. Who wants tea?

      George raises his hand... hold on... then:

                    What happened there? What did you 
                    do? Did you just make it go off?

      George huffs. Irritated. He doesn t want to discuss this. 
      Annie looks to Mitchell for an explanation. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    Round the time he changes, his

      George turns to Mitchell, noisily devouring his pizza. *
      George watches, a little grossed out.

    He raises a glass of water to his mouth. There is a tremor 
    in his hand that makes the glass clatter slightly against 
    his teeth. He moves the glass quickly away, glances around 
    to see if the others noticed. 

                                    ANNIE

      George nods. A broken man. Annie gathers up the mugs and 
      trots off to the kitchen. Mitchell stands, starts gathering 
    his things to go.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Come on.

                    We ll see you later.

    And they go. Annie looks around at the house, suddenly 
      empty and lifeless. 




      Mitchell and George trudge into work. They clock in / sign

                    Cool. I ll come and let you out 
                    in the morning.

      There is a gesture between them, a hug maybe, something 
      unspoken. This is a familiar routine now but Mitchell knows 
    the horrors his friend is about to endure.

      George peels off. Mitchell is by a couple of screens. Flat 
      grey footage from CCTVcameras dotted around the hospital. 
      Something catches his eye. 

    One camera looks on to an empty corridor. Lift doors. They  
      open. No one gets in, no one gets out. The empty lift just 
      sits there. The doors close again. Mitchell watches the 
      screen.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 11.

      Mitchell walks down a corridor. It's empty. A patient 
      maybe, wandering along. Mitchell looks around. It's as if 
      he's trying to find the thinnest trace of a scent on the 
      air, or a distant sound. 




      A ward, with private rooms at the end. Mitchell slips down 
    the aisle, past the nurse at the Nurse's Station. There's 
      nothing here. Nothing out of the ordinary. But his eye is 
      drawn to a room, the door firmly shut, the blinds down.




      There's one bed in the room, one patient. Deeply asleep, 
      wired up to beeping monitors. And standing over him is 
      Seth. He looks up at Mitchell as Mitchell enters. They keep 
      their voices low.

                                    SETH
                    Jesus, Mitchell, how are you 
                    supposed to find anywherein this 
                    place? I followed the signs for 
                    Intensive Care, I ended back 
                    where I came in!

                                    MITCHELL
                    What are you doing here, Seth?

                    Herrick thinks recruitment should 
                    be more tactical. People with 
                    money and influence. No more 
                    tramps or people who fall asleep 
                    on the Night Bus. Our gatherings

      Seth takes his coat off, preparing to feed. 

                                    SETH (CONT'D)
                    This guy, I think he s on the

                    Leave him alone.

                                    SETH
                    What, you want to share?

                    No, I ve... I vestopped.

                    Yeah we ve had this conversation. 
                    What blood type is he anyway?
                              (thechart)
                      A Positive. Hmmm.A bit Jacob s 
                    Creek-yfor me, but there you go.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Move away from the bed, Seth.

      Seth stops, looks at Mitchell. Fuck, he s serious...

                                    SETH
                    Remember that guy, the student. 
                    When was it? 58, 59? Or you and 
                    Herrick and the girl in the 
                    hotel? What about that couple in 
                    the park? You can t stop, 
                    Mitchell. This is what we are.
                            (a grin)
                    Come on. Just a taste. A sip. 

    The temptation, the urge to drink, is so strong Mitchell 
      literally shudders. This is torture. He has to wrench the 
      words out.

                                    MITCHELL
                      I said...leave him alone...

      Seth s grins fades into a sneer of contempt.

                                    SETH
                    Or what? Look at you, when was 
                    the last time you fed? You re 
                    shaking, you re sweating. You 
                    really think you re up to getting 
                    busy with me?

      Mitchell says nothing. Seth snorts - he thought as much.

                                    SETH (CONT D)
                    Now get into character and watch 
                    the door. I ve got a job to do.

    He pulls the sheet down, exposing the patient s neck. 
      Mitchell grips Seth by the arm and tries to yank him back 
      from the bed. Seth swings his arm back, knocking Mitchell s 
      hand away. Mitchell slams Seth back into the wall. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 13.

      They face each other, nose to nose. Mitchell clearly had 
      more fight in him than Seth suspected.

                                    MITCHELL
                    I don t care if the coolest kid 
                    in school is suddenly your mate, 
                    Seth. To me you ll always be that 
                    milky little creep who smells of 
                    biscuits. Tell Herrick the 
                    hospital is out of bounds.

    He lets Seth go. Seth says nothing. Then shrugs, smiles his 
      yellow smile and heads for the door. He stops.

                                    SETH
                    A word of warning. One  friend  
                    to another. It s cold out there 
                    without us.

      Seth leaves. Mitchell takes a deep breath. And another.




      George is chatting to a nurse - Becca. She s in her 20s, 
      pretty, but homesick and a little shy. She has an armful of 
      laundry, George pushes an elderly man in a wheelchair

                                    BECCA
                    Yeah, just outside Leeds. I mean, 
                    I loved it, but I thought  if I 
                    don t get out now...  Coz mates 
                    of mine, some are married or with 
                    kids, and they ve just stayed.

      They ve stopped by a little makeshift shrine. Cards and 
      photos and flowers (withering a little now) are pinned and 
      pasted to a wall. One photo dominates and provides the 
      focal point. A woman in her 20s.Beautiful. Happy. Utterly 
      alive and vibrant. This is Lauren. George looks at the 
      flowers and cards. Becca watches him.

                                    BECCA (CONT D)
                    Who was she?

                    Lauren. Worked in A+E.

                    When did she die?

                                      GEORGE
                    A couple of months before you 
                    started. Heart attack. She was 
                    20, 21? I know, mad, isn t it.

    He looks at the main photo. Lost for a moment.

                    She was beautiful...

                    Look. They re doing a little 
                    memorial thing. Planting a tree.

      Mitchell approaches them quickly.

                                    MITCHELL
                    George.

                              (looks at his watch)
                    Shit.
                              (to the old man)
                    Sorry.

                    Shit, I ve got to be somewhere. 
                    Kind of now. 

    He quickly takes the laundry from Becca, pops it on the old 
      man s lap and hands the wheelchair over to Becca.

                                    BECCA
                              (to Mitchell)

                    In your own time.

      George scurries off. Sneaks a glance back at Becca as he 
      goes.

                                    BECCA

      George trots down the stairs towards the isolation room. 
      Voices ahead make him stop. Shit, there are people in 
      there... He creeps closer to the door. Two maintenance men 
    are clearing out the battered old desks and boxes. 

                                      GEORGE
                    Hello? Uh, what are you doing?

                                      MAINTENANCE GUY
                    This is gonnabe the site office 
                    when they start building the 
                    admin wing. You should have seen 
                    the state of it! The furniture 
                    all smashed, these marks on the 
                    walls... They been keeping the 
                    mentalsin here or what?

      George looks at his watch and stumbles back up the stairs. 

    The other workmen is brandishing a drill. He rams it into 
    the wall. The growl and squeal of the drill is magnified. 
      Then it changes, into a scream of metal and wild creatures. 
      Deafening and painful, like a giant engine grinding and 
      roaring. The kind of sound that swallows your own scream 
      whole.

      FADE TO:

      Mitchell s face. A brittle smile fixed in place as he tries 
    to ignore the fury of the scream inside him. Something else 
      cuts through the noise. A voice. Insistent.

                                    BECCA (O.C.)
                      Mitchell... Mitchell.

    He blinks. Snapped back to reality. Bolsters the smile. The 
      scream fades out and we pull out to find ourselves in...




                                    MITCHELL
                    George, wait. It s too risky. 

                                      GEORGE
                    What?!

                                    MITCHELL
                    You haven t had time to find 
                    somewhere. You can t just run 
                    into some random bit of

                                      GEORGE
                    Well what else can I do?

                                    MITCHELL
                    Come back to the house.

                                      GEORGE

                                    MITCHELL
                    For God s sake, George, you can t 
                    always keep it separate. This is 
                    happening. This is partof you. 

      George bolts into the woods. Mitchell yells after him.

                                    MITCHELL (CONT D)
                    It s safethere! We can contain
                    you! George! George!




      Mitchell peers out of the window. There s George. Pounding 
      back towards the car. He yanks open the door, scrambles in.

                                      GEORGE
                    No, you re right, let s go back 
                    to the house.

                                    MITCHELL
                    What? 

                                      GEORGE
                    Like you said, it s safer there.

      Mitchell is too stunned to move.

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    So can we go? Like, now?

      Mitchell isn t going to argue. He starts the car and speeds 
      off. George looks back at the woods. It s as if he can 
      still feel that shadowy figure watching him.




      Annie is in the kitchen, pouring hot water into a line of 
      mugs. Suddenly the front door bursts open and George and 
      Mitchell pile in. Annie walks through to the living room.

                                    ANNIE
                    Alright, George? What are you 
                    doing back? I thought it was your 
                    time of the month.

                                    MITCHELL
                    It is. He s doing it here.

                    George, what do you need?

      George is shifting furniture, clearing a space in the 
      centre of the room.

                    Annie.

      Annie is being propelled along by events and the boy s 
      frenzy. She fumbles with the CD player while Mitchell runs 
      around, yanking the curtains closed.

                                    MITCHELL (CONT D)

      Everything stops. Mitchell and George stare at Annie.

                                    ANNIE (CONT D)
                    Just for a bit. I want to see

      George looks to Mitchell. This can t be happening.

                    Please, George. It s not like you

      George shakes his head. What the hell. Everyone is crazy.

                    its line of vision. If it sees 
                    you, I don t know what it ll do.

      A shudder runs through him.

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    It s coming.




      Annie is in the kitchen, looking at George through the 
      serving hatch. George has stripped. He just stands there 
      shivering, his hands over his groin. The atmosphere is 
      tense and tight as a drum. But oddly awkward too. Despite 
    the pounding music. There s nothing to do but wait.

                                    ANNIE
                              (making conversation) 
                    I see someone s finally moved 
                    into number 18 -

      Suddenly George screams and jackknifes. It makes Annie gasp 
    and stumble backwards.




      From the expression on Annie s face, the transformation has 
      obviously taken hold. We hear George screams as the curse 
      thunders through him. 

      From the kitchen, Annie watches. Hypnotized, but horrified. 
      It s awful to watch every shred of George s humanity torn 
    so painfully away. She screws her eyes shut.     "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 22.



    The front door eases open and Mitchell and Annie peer in.

      Imagine the aftermath of the biggest wildest party in the 
      world, then throw a hand grenade into that. What s left 
      wouldn t look dissimilar to the living room now. Everything 
    is upside down. Some of the furniture has been atomized. 
      Even the wallpaper is shredded. And lying amid the 
      wreckage, naked and unconscious, is George.

      Later. Dressed now, George comes down the stairs. He stops 
    and stares. Mitchell and Annie have cleared all the 
      wreckage out of the living room, leaving it cavernous and 
      echoing. George looks around. They ve lost so much.

                                      GEORGE
                    My God. What did it do?

                                    MITCHELL
                    We ve salvaged what we can. But 
                    there s about 10 bin bags of crap 
                    and wreckage stashed in my 
                    bedroom. I m sensing a trip to 
                    Ikea.And you know my feelings

                    Leave the rest to me. It s the

      Mitchell and Annie exchange glances. Mitchell rolls his 
      eyes. Annie tries not to literally squeal with excitement.

      George gestures around at the conspicuously empty room.

      Mitchell re-enters the living room from the kitchen, hands 
      Owen a beer.

                    just let it run and eventually 
                    the water comes through. But it s 
                    kind of driving George nuts.

                    No worries. I ll take a look. 
                    Like I said, it s such a relief 
                    having you guys here.

      Mitchell and Owen look around. There s nowhere to sit but a 
      couple of upturned boxes.

                                    OWEN (CONT D)
                    It didn t work out with the last 
                    lot of people - oh cheers. 
                              (theyclink)
                    I think they heard about what 
                    happened and let their 
                    imaginations run away with them.

                                    MITCHELL
                    A little. Just what the estate 
                    agent said. 

                                    OWEN
                    I ve hardly been back since. You 
                    can imagine, it s still kind of 
                    weird being here.

      Mitchell lowers his voice, aware of Annie upstairs.

                                    MITCHELL
                    What happened exactly? If you 
                    don t mind me asking.

                                    OWEN
                    We d literally just moved in, we 
                    were still living out of boxes. 
                    It was dark, I hadn t sorted out 
                    the wiring yet. She was at the 
                    top of the stairs and... They 
                    said she must have fallen 
                    awkwardly. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    What was she like?

      Owen is a little taken aback by the question. But something 
      about Mitchell, his calm assurance, makes Owen open up. 

                                    OWEN
                    Annie? She was... extraordinary. 
                    She was kind. And funny. Cleverer 
                    than she thought she was... 
                            (a sad smile)
                    And she was mine.

                    I believe people can leave an 
                    echo, in a place where they were. 
                    I know the tennantsbefore us

                                    OWEN
                    They said it was creepy.

                    It s not, it s not creepy. It s 
                    good. It s happy. We like it.

      Owen drinks. He nods. Thank you. George comes downstairs.

                                    OWEN
                    What was it?

                    What? Oh a... pigeon.

                    Must have left a window open.

                    Have you got rid of it?

                                      GEORGE
                              (beat)

                                    MITCHELL
                    You killed it?

                                      GEORGE
                    With a shoe.

      Mitchell is positioned behind Owen. He throws his arms up 
    in surrender - Ok, that s it, I give up. 

                                    OWEN
                    You know what? I should... I 
                    should be going.

                                    MITCHELL
                              (jumps up)
                    It was lovely to meet you. Like I

      Annie peeps around the corner, down the stairs. She can 
      just about see Owen s feet and legs. 

                                    OWEN (O.S.)
                    Thanks for the drink. Any 
                    problems, you ve got my number.

                                    MITCHELL (O.S.)
                    Cool. Lovely to meet you.




      Mitchell closes the door and turns to George.

                                    MITCHELL
                    How dyou do that, stay so calm? 

                                      GEORGE
                    Ok, shut up.

                                    MITCHELL
                    You re a spy, aren t you. I mean 
                    you ve clearly had training. 
                    Because the way you held it 
                    together there, it was chilling. 

      Annie has walked down from upstairs. Mitchell and George 
      watch her nervously, as if she might shatter into a 
      thousand pieces at any moment. 

                                    MITCHELL (CONT D)
                    He loved you very much, Annie. 
                    The way he talked about you... 
                    You made him very happy.

                                      GEORGE
                              (beat)
                    Did you ask about the tap?

      Mitchell turns imploringly to George - PLEASE stop talking.

                                    ANNIE
                    Is this his?

                                    MITCHELL
                    What?

                                    ANNIE

                                    MITCHELL
                    Yeah.

      Annie picks up Owen's beer bottle. Touches the rim to her 
      lips. Her lips to his.  




    The first thing Mitchell sees when he enters the canteen is 
    the crowd of nurses, doctors and porters, gathered around a 
      table, laughing and clapping. He frowns, what s going on? 

    He draws nearer and his face drops. There at heart of the 
      crowd is Herrick. One of the vampire officers from the 
      World War 1 battlefield.

    But this time, we see that Herrick is a policeman.

      He s performing some coin tricks. The crowd lap it up. 

                                    HERRICK
                    Now watch. You re not watching.

      Cries of  We are! We are! 

      Herrick holds a coin between his thumb and forefinger. A 
      flutter of hands. The coin is gone. Some  Ooohs from the 
      crowd. Herrick sweeps his hand across the table, and a 
      shower of coins clatter and bounce from his palm.

      Squeals and applause from the crowd. 

      Herrick watches as some of them scrabble around the table 
    and chairs for the coins, his expression a mixture of 
      curiosity and detachment. 

    He looks up and spots Mitchell watching from the sidelines. 

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Ah, sorry, guys. There s my 
                    friend.

      Cries of  No!   Don t go!  Herrick laughs.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Will you stop? Another time, I 
                    promise.

      Herrick and Mitchell watch the crowd disperse, chattering 
      happily about the little show. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 32.

                    isn t your fucking larder,

                                    HERRICK
                    A social call, nothing more. 
                    We re worried about you.

                                    MITCHELL
                    We re meant to keep a low 
                    profile. Coming here, attacking 
                    people in their sleep, that s not

                     Seth said . Listen. There s 
                    something you need to know about 
                    Seth.

      Herrick puts his hand on Mitchell s shoulder, steeling 
      himself as if about to break terrible news. 

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    He s an idiot.

      Herrick laughs, pats his shoulder - come on - and strolls 
      over to the counter. Mitchell follows.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    But it makes you think, doesn t

                    and cannot do. For instance,

      Behind the counter is a young girl, maybe 19. Gauche. 
      Braces. Spots.

                    You do Hot Chocolate?

    The girl nods. Herrick turns to Mitchell - you want 
      anything? Mitchell shakes his head.

                                    HERRICK
                    Well. I m sure they appreciate 
                    what you do.

    He hands her the money. She shyly waves it away.

                                    GIRL
                    Actually. It s fine.

                    Well you re very kind. Take it 
                    easy.

    He and Mitchell walk away, towards the doors.

                                                                                              *


      Herrick strolls through to the reception area. Mitchell 
      skulking uncomfortably by his side. 

                                    HERRICK
                    But I m willing to bet, you offer 
                    people eternal life, not just for 
                    them but their lovers and 
                    children, and the queues would 
                    stretch a thousand miles!

    He leans in closer, his voice is barely a whisper.*

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Let s go up to the children s 
                    ward. Those parents she was 
                    taking about, you think a single 
                    one of them would turn us away?*

                    You ve thought about it, haven t

      Mitchell recoils. But not from disgust. Herrick s eyes are *
      blazing with urgency. *

                    I wouldn t expect you to

      A crackle of static and voices over his radio.

      Mitchell says nothing.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Something to ponder.

      Herrick smiles and his eyes scorch black - just for a 
      second. He turns and strolls away. Mitchell doesn t move. 




    The next morning. George is sorting through a linen 
      cupboard, piling stuff into Mitchell s arms.

                                      GEORGE
                    Listen, I m going to that thing 
                    later. The memorial thing, for 
                    Lauren. You want to come?

                                    MITCHELL
                    Um, I don t know...

                                      GEORGE

                     nice  so much as...  horrible . 
                    I thought you were friends.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Not really. A bit. Towards the 
                    end.

                                    VOICE
                    George.

    It makes him jump. He spins around. But it s Becca.

      George hands the pillow cases to Becca.

                                      GEORGE
                    You ve changed your shampoo. It s

                                      GEORGE
                    I ve just got a good sense of 
                    smell.

                                    BECCA
                    You like it?

                    Yes, you smell like a Polo.

      They laugh. 

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Have you got a hole?

    And the laughter dies. George winces. Mitchell stuffs a 
      pillow case in his mouth. Becca just blinks, disconcerted.

                                    BECCA
                    I ll, uh, see you later, yeah?

      Becca walks on. Mitchell turns to George. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    Shit, are you interested in her?

                                      GEORGE
                    No. I don t know. Why, are you?

                                    MITCHELL
                    Me? God, no. I mean, she s nice, 
                    but if you're interested in her, 
                    I'll - because it's not like you 
                    get interested in people every 
                    day. I don't want to discourage

                    I don t know. I don t know. Let 
                    me think about it.

      George starts to walk away. Mitchell looks down. His hand 
    is shaking. He stuffs it in his pocket. George has stopped. 

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Oh yeah. Have you seen my phone?




      Annie is looking at the mobile phone in her hand. She s 
      typed a text message. It reads:

       Tap in kitchen making very odd noises. Clducome + 
      repair? This afternoon good. Hope UR well. From george. 

    She presses  send . Then swallows. No turning back now.




      George, alone in the hospital staff toilets. He washes his 
      face, rubs his eyes wearily and looks at himself in the 
      mirror. Nothing behind him in the reflection but the 
      opposite wall. He starts tugging off his tie. A hand 
      touches his shoulder. 

                                      LAUREN

      George almost jumps out of his skin. But the bigger shock 
    is when he spins around and sees who it is.

                                      GEORGE
                    Lauren...?

                                      LAUREN
                    Surprise.

    She looks amazing. Her eyes glow a brilliant, dazzling 
      green. Her hair is as red as fire. She seems to swirl up 
    out of nowhere, out of shadows. She s grinning darkly. 
      Hungrily. She looks beautiful. Ferocious.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Enjoy my memorial service? Shame 
                    Mitchell couldn t make it. Maybe 
                    he ll come to your one.

      George scrambles back away from her. But he doesn t cry 
      out. Lauren looms over him, moving closer... closer... 

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Your face. This must be 
                    confusing. Let me explain: Before 
                    I died I had this one odd last 
                    thought. And now I m going to 
                    make it yours. You know all the 
                    things you were scared of as a 
                    kid? All the monsters under the 
                    bed?

    She is barely an inch away from him now, her eyes burning 
      black, her voice a hiss in his ear.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    They re all real.

    She stops. Regards George for a moment. Straightens up.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Ok, I m kind of new to this, but 
                    aren t you supposed to weep or 
                    scream or wee yourself? I ve 
                    never loomed up on someone before 
                    and I was really looking forward 
                    to it. 

                                      GEORGE
                    Mitchell did this to you?

    The grin has gone now. She stares at George with cold fury. 

                                      LAUREN
                    You know? You know what he is?

    And then something else - a realisation.

                    Oh my God.

    She backs away. And she's gone. 




      Mitchell is mopping a floor. George stomps towards him.

      George punches him in the face. Mitchell staggers back, 
      more from shock than the blow itself.

                    I didn t hear you complaining 
                    when I saved you from those other
                    vampires. There s no escape from 
                    it. I m not like you, I don t

                                      GEORGE
                    Then why are we even trying?

      They stare at each other. There s nothing more to say. 

      George turns and walks away. Mitchell is left, winded.

      Becca approaches from the other direction.

                                    BECCA
                    Hey. Oh shit, sorry, can I walk 
                    there? Did you just mop that?

                                    MITCHELL
                    It s fine.

                                    BECCA
                    So do you want to go out for a 
                    drink with me? 

      Mitchell turns to her - what?

                                    BECCA (CONT D)
                    Yep, I ve made a decision, no 
                    more procrastination. I ve been 
                    meaning to do it for ages, but 
                    kept putting it off. That sounded 
                    so much funnier in the Ladies. 

      Mitchell looks at her for a long time. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    What the hell.




      A mirror. The sound of hairspray.Suddenly Annie 
      straightens up and looks at her reflection. Her hair is 
      wild and blow dried. She looks terrifying. 

                                    ANNIE
                      AAAHHHHHHHHHH!

                    Be not afraid.

    She sighs. That just sounds stupid. Pulls a spooky face.

                                    ANNIE (CONT D)
                      WoooOOOOooooOOOO.

    She slumps and looks flatly at herself. No funny faces, 
      nothing. Just herself. Very frightened.




      Annie s working out the best place to present herself. She 
      stands in the centre of the living room. Sits. Stands 
      again. 

    CUT TO:

    She tries the kitchen, appearing suddenly from behind the 
      door. No, too weird.

    CUT TO:

      She s gone back to standing in the centre of the living 
      room. She waits. She looks at her watch.

    CUT TO:


      Bored now, Annie is sat on the floor, leaning against the 
      wall watching TV.3 or 4 mugs of tea around her. 

    The doorbell rings. Annie sits bolt upright. Oh Christ. 

      Silence. Then the doorbell rings again. 

      Annie stands in the centre of the room and prepares 
      herself. But at the sound of a key in the lock, her courage 
      fails her. She scrambles around the corner and flattens 
      herself against the wall as Owen steps through the door. 

                                    OWEN
                    George? It s Owen. Mitchell?

      Annie takes a deep breath. Ok, here goes... 

                                    OWEN (CONT D)
                    The TV s on.

      Annie stops, frowns, who s he talking to?

    And we see a woman step through the door behind him.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 43.

                    Maybe he popped out.

                                    OWEN
                              (calls out again)
                    Hello? I rang the doorbell...!
                              (to the woman)
                    You don t have to do this, Janey. 
                    You can wait in the car.

      Annie s jaw is on her chest. She mouths miserably to 
      herself - Janey Harris...! 

                                    JANEY
                    It s fine. I want to. 

                                    OWEN
                    You think I should turn this off?

      Owen is moving towards the TV, towards Annie. She panics. 
      She s trapped. Owen walks into view. Annie gasps. Owen 
      turns and looks right at her, rigid, flat against the wall.

                                    OWEN (CONT D)
                    You say something?

                                    JANEY
                    What?

                                    OWEN
                    Did you say something?

      He s looking right through Annie. He can t see her. 

                                    JANEY
                    You re hearing things... You 
                    going to look at this tap?

      Owen doesn t move for a moment. Just stares at / through 
      Annie. Then he turns the TVoff and walks back towards the 
      kitchen, away from Annie.

                                    OWEN
                    Yeah. It could take a while. 
                    Really, go and wait in the car.

    He disappears into the kitchen. Annie tentatively peers 
      around the corner, watching them. 

                                    JANEY (O.S.)
                    And miss you doing D.I.Y?It d be 
                    like missing an eclipse.    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 44.



      Owen stands over the sink. Runs the tap. Janey watches him.

                                    JANEY
                    You alright?

                                    OWEN
                    Yeah, I suppose. It s weird being 
                    here.

      Owen crouches, looks at the pipes under the sink. Bangs 
      them a bit. It s all a bit cursory. 

                                    OWEN (CONT D)
                    I have no idea what I m doing. 
                    I ll come back later.

    The sound of a key in the lock. 




    The front door opens. It's George. The first thing he sees 
    as he steps inside is Annie, peeping around the corner of 
    the living room, with a look of frozen wide-eyed horror.

                                      GEORGE
                    Oh. Hello. 
                              (beat)
                    What?

    He follows her eyes round to find Owen and Janey standing 
    in the doorway to the kitchen behind him. George yells.

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    AHHHHhhhhhello!

                    Hi, George, sorry, we rang the 
                    doorbell, but no one answered.

      George spins a little on the spot, back and forth, looking 
      from Annie to Owen and Janey. Can t they see her?

                                      GEORGE
                    No, no, no, it s fine, it s...

                    This is my partner, Janey.

      That gets George s attention.

                                      GEORGE
                    Janey...?

                    Right. Hello.

    He glances back over his shoulder. Annie is still in plain 
      view but obviously only to George. She s sat back on the 
      floor with her knees up, her head buried in her arms.

                                    OWEN
                    I think I ll have to come back, 
                    take a look at the tank in the 
                    attic. When are you, uh, not in? 
                    I don t want to disturb you.

      Owen and Janey start moving towards the door.

                    It was nice to meet you.

      They take their leave and go. George shuts the door. Annie 
    is still bunched up on the floor.

                    Annie -

    And suddenly she s up on her feet, in the middle of the 
      room. Angry, tearful, punchy.

                    But I knewif he saw me again

    And the tears start and her voice starts to crack.

                    now she gets to kiss him and 
                    watch him shave and laugh and I m 
                    still in the clothes Idied in. I 
                    get nothing. I get the memories 
                    and a house I can never 
                    completely leave and you. SHE 
                    GETS HIM AND I GET YOU.

    She slides down the wall opposite, her head in her hands, 
    and weeps and weeps. George doesn't know what to say. He 
      sits down on the floor next to her. 

                                      GEORGE
                    After I got... after I lost 
                      everything, I ran away. I met 
                    Mitchell and we came here and met 
                    you and... I d just about come to

                    And then I saw her. My ex. And 
                    she d found someone else. And it 
                    was so... savage. So I know how 
                    it feels. Like losing everything

      George is a little thrown. No one s ever asked him before.

                    We were on holiday in Scotland.

                    Why couldn t Owen see you?

                                    ANNIE
                    Maybe it was the shock of it. 
                    Like it... set me back. 

                                      GEORGE
                    Like a relapse?

                                    ANNIE
                    There s so much about this I 
                    don t understand.

                    What did you think of her? Janey. 

                                      GEORGE
                    She s... orange. 

                                    ANNIE
                    She works in the Tanning Salon. 
                    She thinks she looks classy. I 
                    think she looks like Kilroy.

                                      GEORGE
                    You re much prettier. And much 
                    nicer.

                                    ANNIE
                    And much deader.

      George says nothing. On an impulse, he puts his arm round 
      Annie. She smiles sadly and settles in to his embrace. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 48.

    Her head on his shoulder. And they sit like that. In their 
      living room. Looking at the blank screen of the TV.




      George wanders onto a ward, in his hospital scrubs. At the 
      Nurse s Station, an HCA has a phone clamped between her 
      neck and shoulder, she s looking at a patient s chart.

                                    HCA
                    What does that look like to you? 
                    A 3 or a 5?

                                      GEORGE
                    A 3?

                                    HCA
                    That s what I thought. That s 
                    Becca s handwriting. So if she 
                    gave Mr Davieshis medsat 3, 
                    then he needs them again now. But 
                    if it s a 5, then he won t need 
                    them till 10 o clock.

    The HCA hangs up. She wanders off. George hasn t moved. 




      Mitchell and Becca are in a bar. They are already several 
      drinks down. Becca looks beautiful. She s clearly gone to a 
    lot of effort for this. They re laughing.

                                    MITCHELL
                    I m serious. If there s another

                    That s ridiculous! 

                                    MITCHELL
                    And at my age. Now you: something 
                      embarrassing.

                                    BECCA
                    Uhhhh.Ok. It wasn t until 6 
                    months ago I stopped ringing my 
                    ex every time I got drunk. 
                              (cringes)
                    Oh God, I shouldn t have told you 
                    that.

                                    BECCA

      Mitchell laughs. Drinks. That tremor in his hand again.

                    Oh I meant to ask. How s the not-

                    Not great. But I m thinking, once 
                    a smoker always a smoker. What s 
                    the point of fighting it?    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 50.



                                    BECCA
                    So... so would you like to come 
                    back to mine? My flat-mate s out. 
                    We d have the place to ourselves.

      Mitchell swallows the last of his drink. Everything has 
      been set in motion, and now it will just carry him along. 
    He takes the breath that will say  yes . But Becca is 
      looking over his shoulder.

                                    BECCA (CONT D)
                    Is that a friend of yours?

      Mitchell turns. His face falls. Pushing through the crowded 
      bar, making a b-linefor them... is Lauren. 

                                      LAUREN
                    Well lookeehere. Mind if I join

                    Aren t you going to introduce us?

                    I should explain. Me and Mitchell 
                    dated. Just once really. Well it 
                    was kind of a date. So where are

                                    MITCHELL
                    Please don t do this.

      Mitchell is on his feet.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Get up.

                                      LAUREN
                    But I want to see her face when

                                    MITCHELL
                    GET UP.

      A few heads turn. Lauren shrugs, stands. Mitchell grabs her 
    arm and marches her towards the door. Lauren calls back 
      over her shoulder to Becca.

                                      LAUREN
                    You seem nice. Maybe afterwards 
                    we can be friends... hang out...

    And they re gone. Becca is left, completely bewildered. 




      Mitchell returns to the bar. 

                                    BECCA
                    You alright? What was that about?

                    Oh. Oh, Ok.

                                    MITCHELL
                    I just think it s best.

                    you re safe.

                    Whatever. I just need a pee.

    She trails off dejectedly to the toilets.

      Mitchell slumps back into his chair. He takes a breath. He 
      looked over the precipice... and stepped back.




    In the bar, Becca still hasn't come back. Mitchell is 
      uneasy. He gets up.




      Mitchell is standing by the door of the ladies toilets. A 
      woman steps out. 

                                    WOMAN
                    No, she s not in there.

      Suddenly a scream from outside. Mitchell is standing by the 
      fire exit. He swings the door open, out onto the alleyway.




      A blood soaked George sits on chairs in the corridor. 
      Further along, Mitchell - also covered in blood and dirt 
      from the alley - is with a group of police, uniformed and 
      plain clothed. A doctor arrives. Shakes his head. 

    The Police talk among themselves, talk to Mitchell. After a 
      moment Mitchell breaks off from the group and walks towards 
      George. George stands, steeling himself for the inevitable.

                                      GEORGE
                    Is this how it ends then? They 
                    connect her to you, youto 
                    Lauren. Everything gets blown 
                    open. We lose it all.

                                    MITCHELL
                    No. They have ways of doing this. 
                    Come on.

                                      GEORGE
                    What do you mean?

                                    MITCHELL
                    We ve been around for thousands 
                    of years. You think it s the 
                    first time something like this 
                    has happened?

    He looks back down the corridor at the group of Policemen. 
    One of them is watching Mitchell and George. It s Herrick. 
    And by his side, Seth.

                                    MITCHELL (CONT D)
                    We have branches everywhere.




      Mitchell and George wander out through a conspicuously 
      quiet reception.

                                      GEORGE
                    Wait here. I ll see if I can find 
                    a cab.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 58.

    He scurries out. Mitchell just stands where George has left 
      him, still dazed and shaken.

                                    HERRICK (O.S.)
                    Hey, Mitchell.

      Mitchell looks up. Herrick has followed them out, Seth 
      trailing in his wake. They are standing on a little balcony 
      that crosses reception.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    It s all about to start. We re 
                    drawing up lists. It s make your 
                    mind up time.

      Mitchell thinks for a moment. The next thing he says will 
      determine the rest of his life.

                                    MITCHELL
                    I choose them.

      Herrick s expression remains utterly inscrutable. But his 
      eyes scorch black as he regards Mitchell. 

                                    HERRICK
                    Pity.

    He steps back, moving away into the shadows.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Be seeing you.

                            (a sly grin)
                    And your little dog.

    He too turns, strolls back into the darkness.




      Mitchell is sat on the floor of the empty living room. His 
      eyes wet with tears. He stares ahead, lost and shattered. 
    His clothes still caked with Becca s blood.




      Annie and George, in his dressing gown, are watching 
      Mitchell from the doorway to the kitchen. Their voices low.

                                      GEORGE
                    I d forgotten what they re like.
                    The others. They re predators. 
                    Every inch of them.

                    Just hunger and fury. 
                              (looksat Mitchell)
                    The energy it must take him, 
                    every minute every day, notto be 
                    like that...

                                    ANNIE
                    You think he should have saved 
                    her?

                                      GEORGE
                    I think he did.

      Annie moves back into the kitchen, starts making tea. 
      George watches his friend for a moment, then turns. 

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    We should go out.

                                    ANNIE
                    What?

                                      GEORGE
                    To the pub. Anywhere. It ll do us 
                    all good.

                                    ANNIE
                    I don t know... I think I want to 
                    stay in the house.

                                      GEORGE
                    Let me put some clothes on and -

                                    ANNIE
                    I want to stay in the house now.
                              (beat)
                    Please. I m sorry. I just feel 
                    safer here. There are monsters 
                    out there. But here, when it s 
                    the three of us, I feel like 
                    nothing can touch us then.

      George sighs. He nods. Ok. 

      Annie smiles, grateful, and walks through to the living 
      room. She sits next to Mitchell, her arm around him, pulls 
    him close to her. She looks back to George. Smiles again.

      George picks up his blood splattered clothes from a pile on 
    the floor and dumps them in the sink. He rolls his eyes as 
    the tap clanks and splutters.
