      FADE IN:

      EXT. HIGH DESERT ROAD - DAY (D/1)11

      A long stretch of desert road abruptly cluttered with a mass 
      of California and Nevada Highway Patrolmen milling about a 
      CRIME SCENE.  We see LISBON talking with a Captain as he 
      inputs data into a handheld GPS.  

      JANE, RIGSBY, VAN PELT and CHO stand slightly apart, watching 
      Lisbon.

                                  CHO
                    That damn GPS is going to put it in 
                      California.  I know it.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Think positive.  It s Nevada.  
                      Definitely Nevada.

      ANGLE ON: A SEVERED RIGHT HAND lying on the asphalt, palm up.

      The number  43  is written small in ink -- very faded now --  
      on the palm of the hand.  

      Starting from the hand, two uniform HIGHWAY PATROLMEN (one 
        Californian, one Nevadan) unroll big tape measures toward  
      two signs:  One that says  California Border  and the other 
       Nevada Border. 

                                  CHO
                    You re dreaming.  We ll catch it.  
                    A stone cold mystery. 

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Forensics are already running the 
                    prints.  Maybe we ll get a quick 
                    match.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We d never get that lucky.  We re 
                    going to be  talking to the hand  
                    for a long while.

                                  JANE
                    Why so glum?  A case is a case.

                                  RIGSBY
                      Dismemberments are a pig.  You can 
                    spend months just assembling the 
                    victim.  And there s always a piece 
                    missing.   

                                  JANE 
                    There s already plenty to work with 
                    right here.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    It s a right hand with a number on 
                    it.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    A male hand, or a not very femme 
                    female.  What else can you get 
                    right here without any forensic 
                    analysis?

                                  JANE
                    Let s see.  Probably a white man in 
                    his fifties.  He wrote on his right 
                    hand, so he s a lefty.  

                                  CHO
                    Maybe the killer wrote it.  Some 
                    kind of message. 

                                  JANE
                    Too faded.  And a killer would 
                    write it bigger.

      Jane gets on his hands and knees to sniff the hand.  Several 
      troopers notice this.  And LISBON who sees him sniff while 
      waiting by a patrol car with the Captain, who gives her a 
      quizzical look. 

                                  LISBON
                      Consultant.

      ON JANE... 

                                  JANE 
                    Smells of almond oil moisturizer, 
                    musky cologne, and tobacco.  His 
                    palms are supple, his nails are 
                      professionally maintained. 

      Jane stands up.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST       "Red-Handed"       GREEN 10/01/08      3.
      CONTINUED: (2)11

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    So, a rich man.  There s a faint 
                    tan line on his little finger from 
                    a missing pinkie ring.  Suggesting 
                    an extrovert in a job where  
                      extroverts thrive.       

                                  VAN PELT
                    So...

                                  JANE
                    He s upper management in the hotel 
                    or gaming business.

                                  CHO
                    Total guess.   

                                  JANE
                    What d you bet I m right? 

      Cho checks his pockets.

                                  CHO 
                      Thirty-five cents.

                                  JANE
                      Thirty-five cents?  I find that hard 
                    to believe considering the huge crayon 
                    bank you ve probably got hiding behind 
                    your bedroom door that s filled with 
                    all the spare change you ve acquired 
                    since you were 15. 

      Cho is alternately mortified and amazed that Jane even 
      guessed something like that about him so accurately.  Rigsby 
      stifles a giggle.

                                  CHO
                          (annoyed)
                      Thirty-five cents.  Take it or 
                    leave it.

                                  JANE
                    You have a bet.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I don t think it s right to gamble 
                    on such things.  That s a human 
                    being that died right there.   

                                  RIGSBY
                    It s okay.  We re in Nevada.  

      Rigsby takes a few steps to the other side of the hand... 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST       "Red-Handed"       GREEN 10/01/08      4.

                    Here, in California, it would be 
                    wrong.
                          (steps back)
                    But here, gambling on body parts is 
                    okay.  

      Lisbon comes over. 

                                  LISBON
                    The hand is three feet into 
                      California, so he s our baby.  

                                  RIGSBY
                          (damn)
                    Hooray.

                                  LISBON
                          (agreeing)
                    Yeah.  Hooray.  Get our friend 
                    bagged and tagged and let s get 
                    going.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Do we have an ID at least?

                                  LISBON
                    Prints say he s James Quincy Meier.  
                    Runs the Calida Resort Casino.

      Cho sighs good-naturedly and tosses Jane the thirty-five 
      cents. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      EXT. UPSCALE HOME IN A WOODED ENCLAVE (ESTABLISHING)22

      INT. MEIER FAMILY LIVING ROOM - DAY (D/1 CONT D)33

      The living room has a  lodge  feel to it replete with an 
      enormous hearth.  Jane wanders the room as he likes to do, 
      while Lisbon and Van Pelt attempt not to sink into the large 
      overstuffed couch as they speak with ANN MEIER, late 40 s, 
      James Meier s widow.  She s a savvy ex-pageant queen and 
        spokesmodel, who made a smooth, well-planned transition to 
      trophy wife.  She exudes discreetly cougarish sexuality.  

      Next to her is her daughter, JESSICA MEIER-CARDEIRA, 20's, 
      who is a quiet, pretty, Junior League type girl, the capable 
      but somewhat introverted child of flamboyant parents.  Her 
      eyes are reddened from crying.  

      She holds hands with husband, DANIEL CARDEIRA -- late 20's, a 
      pallid paunchy but attractive schlub in designer athletic 
      wear and discreet bling -- the archetypal poker pro.  He s 
      supportive and solemn.  

      The only sign that this is a casino family is the BIG TV on  
      one wall showing a SPORTS BOOK LIVE FEED of college football, 
      with the SOUND OFF.  Throughout the interview, Daniel steals 
      discreet glances at the TV to keep up with the results.

                    Yes.  The forensic evidence 
                    supports his hand being severed 
                    post mortem.  After he was dead.

                                  DANIEL
                    And the rest of his body?

                    It doesn t seem real.  Jim was, he 
                    was invincible.

                      Yesterday.  Tuesday morning.  Jim 
                    would often stay overnight at the 
                    resort if he needed to be there 
                    late to resolve an issue but he 
                    would call to let me know he was 
                    staying so I wouldn t worry.  

      Van Pelt looks to Lisbon for an okay to jump in.  Lisbon 
      nods.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    We understand Mr. Meier didn t have 
                      a cellphone.

                                  ANN
                    Didn t believe in them.

                    So was it him that called this 
                    house from a casino phone, at um...

                    Eight oh five Tuesday night?

                                  ANN
                    Yes.  He was just checking in.  

      Jane looks at Ann.  He knows she just lied.

                                  DANIEL
                    Casinos run 24 hours a day.  So Jim 
                    did the same.  I think I saw Jim 
                    more than they did.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Do you work for the Casino as well?

                    Dan is a VIP Guest Services

                    It s more than just that, Daniel.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    What s a house player?

      Jane wanders off.

                    the heavy action going.  It s a

      ON JANE: The voluminous amount of clutter that covers the 
      room.  Jane focuses on a PLAQUE congratulating Jim on 25 
      years of devoted service and a wall of PHOTOS that show Jim 
      shaking hands with people like Frank Sinatra and Gerald Ford.

      Jessica spies Jane walking around the office and enters.

                    Sinatra kissed me right here at my 
                    first birthday party.  That s what 
                    Dad always said anyhow.

      Ann shakes her head,  no,  as she looks to Jessica who is 
      also clueless.

      Daniel reacts to the TV.

      They all turn to look at him.  He points to the game on TV as 
      if that explains everything.

      INT. CALIDA CASINO SECURITY ROOM - DAY99

      One wall of a big dark room is given over to a grid of hi-def 
      SCREENS SHOWING DIFFERENT ANGLES on the CASINO GAMING FLOOR.

      Three blazered SECURITY PEOPLE in earpieces monitor the 
      screens.  Matt oversees them.

      On the other side of the room, Van Pelt debriefs Lisbon.

                      I accessed Meier s calendar.  The 
                    day he disappeared, he listed an

                    if you are able to cross reference 
                    the number with anything else.

      Van Pelt nods and goes back to her laptop.  Lisbon walks over 
      to Matt.  He offers her a seat nearby where they chat.

                    Matt, from what we hear, leaving a 
                    hand to be discovered like that is 
                    an old school mafia signature.

                    Hey.

      INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS1919

      Cho with Alexandra...

                                  CHO
                    Very impressive scheme you set up 
                    with your cousin, Mose.  60% cut on 
                    anything under five grand and 50/50 
                    on anything above.  You must be 
                    living pretty large. 

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    If by large you mean saving up to 
                    buy my mom a new liver before she 
                    dies, then sure.  I m living real 
                    large.  That big twerp told you all 
                    of that?

                                  CHO
                    Started singing like Menudo the 
                    minute he sat down.

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    Good help is so hard to find.

                                  CHO
                    Meier was onto you.  That s what 
                    the meeting was for.  He probably 
                    fired you on the spot, didn t he?

      Alexandra uneasily shifts like Cho hit the spot.

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    Pretty ballsy to come back into 
                    work after something like that.  
                    Only someone who knew he had been 
                    killed would do that.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST       "Red-Handed"       GREEN 10/01/08      21.

                                  CHO
                    Then how did you know before 
                    everyone else here that he was 
                    dead, Alexandra?

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    I didn t.  I came back to beg for 
                    my job.  When I heard what 
                    happened, I realized that no one 
                    knew about our meeting so I went 
                    back to work.  I need this job.

                                  CHO
                    Losing your job, going to jail.  
                    Who s going to look after your mom?  
                    That s a prospect that would make 
                    anyone upset.  If you had a moment 
                    of insanity, I can understand that.  
                    Anyone can understand that.

                    I wonder why Meier didn t talk to 
                    Matt Etienne about her.  As head of 
                    security, she s his ultimate 
                      responsibility.

                                  LISBON
                          (beat)
                    He might have suspected Etienne was 
                    in this with her. 

                                  JANE 
                    Yes.

                    I spent the rest of the night at 
                    the hospital with my mother.

      Jane enters.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry to interrupt.  Quick 
                    question.  When Meier asked you if 
                    Matt Etienne was involved in your 
                    scam, what did you tell him?

                                  ALEXANDRA
                    I told him that Mr. Etienne didn t 
                    have anything to do with it.

                                  JANE
                    But he does, doesn t he?

                    No.

                    Thanks.  You can go.

                                  CHO
                    She can?

      INT. BULLPEN - DAY2222

      Lisbon following Jane as he goes to his corner and lays 
      down...

                                  JANE
                    Sorry, I should have checked with 
                    you first.  We have to go back out 
                    there.  

                                  LISBON
                    The Nevada Gaming Control Board 
                    will want to charge her with gaming 
                      violations.  Why let her go?

                                  JANE 
                    Because why get so hung up on every 
                    little law someone broke?

                                  LISBON
                    Because we re officers of the law?

                                  JANE
                    Also because Matt Etienne is lying.  
                    Now you can call and tell him that 
                    Alexandra Yee has cooperated with 
                    us and based on what she had to 
                    say, we d like to speak to him 
                    first thing in the morning.

                    Okay, but if he is in cahoots with 
                      Alexandra, he ll call her right 
                    away and ask her what she said.

                                  JANE
                    And she ll swear blind that she 
                    said nothing.  Which will only make 
                    Etienne more suspicious.  Why d we 
                    let her go if she gave us nothing?  
                    She must have told us the truth.

                                  LISBON
                    Which is?

                    Details, details.

      He rummages in a shopping bag and comes up with a box, which 
      he gives to Lisbon.  

                                  LISBON
                    What is it?

                    Open it.  It s not a joke turd or 
                    anything like that.  Hey Van Pelt.

      He tosses Van Pelt a similar box.  Lisbon opens her box, and 
      finds an exquisite diamond and emerald necklace/ear-ring set, 
      perfect for her coloring.  

                                  LISBON
                    What is this?

                                  JANE
                    Carbon placed under great pressure.

      Van Pelt takes out a similarly well chosen necklace of 
      precious stones from her box.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Wow.  Wow.

                    I won that money fair and square.  
                    Now I spent it fair and square.

      Lisbon tries to think...

                    But that s so typical of you, to 
                    assume it must be somehow illegal.

      Cho and Rigsby look on with wide eyes. 

                                  CHO
                    So where s our stuff?

                    ladies.  That would be creepy.

      Jane tosses Rigsby and Cho watch boxes which they open to 
      reveal well made but vulgar diamond encrusted diver s 
      watches.

                    money because this is the ugliest

      The team is dressed in their casual  off work  attire.  Jane, 
      Cho, and Rigsby are wearing big watches, Lisbon and Van Pelt 
      in their new jewelry.  They eat greasy-spoon food with beer.  
      They ve already been eating and drinking for an hour or so, 
      so they re nicely relaxed.  

      Jane, Cho and Rigsby are playing a casual game of poker using

                    No, that would be cheating.  Just 
                    memory.

                    Not at all.  Anyone can do it.

                    How?

      Jane takes the remaining stack of cards in hand and does a 
      fancy shuffle.  He is able to cut the cards every time to 
      show the card he is talking about in his memory palace.

                    In my mind, I ve made every card in

                    Not exactly.  Long story.  
                    My point, if the tenth card in the 
                    deck is the two of clubs, I see a 
                    devil horned dancer at the Joplin 
                    Missouri Fairgrounds.    

      Nobody looks very convinced.  He hands the stack of cards to 
      Van Pelt and she shuffles the cards several times before 
      giving the deck back to Jane.

                    Rigsby has two pairs, sixes and 
                    nines.  Cho is hoping to get a 
                    fifth spade to make his flush.  
                    And he will.

      Jane deals the last cards of the hand face up, and Cho gets 
      his spade.  They all laugh at Jane s accuracy.  Lisbon exits 
      to the bathroom. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Too hot for me.

      Jane tosses his cards.  Rigsby does the same.  Cho rakes in 
      the corn chips.

      INT. DIVE DINER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER2424

      Lisbon washes her hands in the sink.  When she is done, she 
      apprises her bejeweled self in the mirror.  Not bad.  She 
      piles her hair up on top of her head and vamps like a model.  
      After a moment of silliness, she suddenly becomes conscious 
      of her surroundings and stops.  She returns to the table.

      Everyone is still being regaled by Jane s card tricks when 
      Lisbon approaches bringing with her the sense that it s time 
      for bed and the party s about to be over.

      She unclasps the necklace and hands it back to Jane along 
      with the earrings.  Lisbon exits to the car.  Beat of 
      silence.  Van Pelt sighs.

                    She s right.

      She takes off her jewelry and hands it to Jane.  She too

      side, a sleeping mask, reads a book, drinks a glass of

      Jane s still awake as the first crack of dawn lightens his

      Jane points at the footprints in the mud, leading around the 
      side of the house and back again.

                    Have you been doing any work on the

      Jane and Lisbon and a couple of Uniformed Cops look in the

      Jane points to the freezer.

      Lisbon gestures to the Cops -- take a look...

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - NIGHT (N/3 CONT D)3636

      Cho and Lisbon enter.  Cho sits down opposite Matt Etienne. 
      Lisbon stands in back.

                                  CHO
                    Let s start at 8 PM the night Jim 
                    Meier was murdered and stuffed in 
                    your fridge.

                                  MATT
                    I called Ann from the casino around 
                    8 PM when I saw that Jim s car was 
                    still parked at the resort.  That 
                    normally meant he was staying the 
                    night so we agreed to meet at 12:30 
                    that night.

                                  CHO
                    But you left work at 11 PM.  What 
                    did you do with the 90 minutes?

                                  MATT
                    I went home, changed clothes and 
                    relaxed a while.

                                  CHO
                    Calida s a small town.  There was 
                    plenty of time for you and Ann to 
                    bash his head in, dump the hand and 
                    hide the body before going to your 
                    hideaway.

                                  MATT
                    I never meet Ann at my house.  

                                  CHO
                    That s very delicate of you.

                                  MATT
                    We always met at the Piney Branch 
                    motel.  On route six.  That s where 
                    we were.

                                  LISBON
                    M.E. says Jim was killed sometime 
                    between 10 PM and 1 AM... right in 
                    that sweet spot of your free time.

                    I didn t kill him.

                                  CHO
                    Was she giving you half of his 
                    estate if you made him disappear?

                                  MATT
                    I have my own money.  I don t need 
                    any of Jim s.

                                  CHO
                    But you needed his wife.  

                                  MATT
                    It s not like that.

                                  LISBON
                    It s exactly like that.  You wanted 
                    Jim s life and you took it out from 
                    under him.

                                  MATT
                    The last time I saw Jim, he was 
                    watching his whale tapes.  You know 
                    what they are?  He has security spy 
                    on the high rollers.  He gets all 
                    the surveillance footage on DVDs, 
                    and he watches them night and day, 
                    to learn what makes each of `em 
                    tick.  Keep `em on the hook. 
                    He was obsessed with his casino.
                    That was his love.  Not Ann.  He 
                    didn t care what she did.

                                  LISBON
                    You might want to get comfy.  
                    You re going to be here a while.

      It is a well appointed suite fit for a high roller.  

      SIX GUYS, including Cal Trask, sit around a poker table, 
      playing cards, using Calida Resort chips.  FREDDY, a fierce 
      old macher, is eating a sandwich from the hospitality spread.

4444INT. PRIVATE SUITE - MORNING (D/4)  

      The game has gone on all night and it s down to Daniel, Cal, 
      and Jane.  Daniel and Cal look like crap in the morning 
      light.  Jane looks like he always does.  Both Daniel and Jane 
      have a sizable amount of chips left while Cal has only a few.  
      Freddy naps in a corner.  NANCY, the Dealer, is still 
      stoically present.

      Daniel and Jane are waiting on Cal to bet.  Cal pushes all he 
      has into the center of the table.

      Jane shows his hand.  Three nines.  Cal grins and looks to 
      Daniel.  Daniel shows his hand -- a full house, aces over 
      eights -- he wins.

                                  DANIEL

                    Sure thing.  

      Cal nods to Jane and exits.  Jane blows air and grins, like -- 
       Phew we got away with it.   Daniel can t help but grin also.

      Jane looks at the Dealer and rolls his eyes.  Daniel sees

      The silent Dealer opens a new pack of cards.  Daniel claps

      winnings.

      Lisbon and Van Pelt looking at Jessica Meier with raised 
      eyebrows...

                                    JESSICA
                    You have to understand.  I know my 
                    husband loves and respects me.  

                                  LISBON
                    You re sure about that?

                          (indignant)
                    He bet your, your honor, on a card 
                    game.  That s despicable.

                                    JESSICA
                    He s a gambler.  I committed to 
                    share that life with him.  
                      Everything he has is collateral.  
                    He d wager his own life in a second 
                    if he thought the odds were right.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    But why did you agree to do it?  

                                    JESSICA
                    Have you ever been in love? 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Sure.

                                    JESSICA
                    So then you know why I did it.   

4848INT. PRIVATE SUITE - SAME   

      It s just Jane and Daniel playing at the table.  Everyone s 
      gone but Nancy the Dealer.  She s silently efficient as ever.  *

      Jane s at the bar making himself a cup of coffee.  While at  *
      the bar, he places a coffee-filled glass on top of a small  *
      ice cube just before he returns to the table with his drink.   *





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST       "Red-Handed"       GREEN 10/01/08      47A.
      CONTINUED:4848

      Upon his return to the table, we see that Jane has nearly all  *
      the chips.  Daniel -- looking exhausted and glum -- is down 
      to a very small pile of hundred dollar chips. 

      ON GLASS AT THE BAR *

      With the benefit of time-lapsed photography, we see the ice  *
      cube melting and the glass on top begins to lean to one side. *

      After shuffling, Nancy passes the deck to Jane so that he can  *
      cut it.*







































                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST       "Red-Handed"       GREEN 10/01/08      48.

                    I guess I got to win this hand to 
                    stay in uh? 

                                  JANE
                    I guess.

      The cube melts enough to make the glass lean even further and  *
      then fall to the ground making a large cracking sound as it  *
      breaks on the floor.  Nancy and Daniel turn to the sound just  *
      as Jane cuts the deck.  At least that s all it looks like  *
      he s done.  Nancy deals out the cards from the cut deck. *

      Daniel picks up his cards.

      INSERT -- He has three kings.  *

      Jane goes for a drink coaster next to him and when he reaches  *
      for it, tips his hand just enough in Daniel s direction for  *
      Daniel to see that Jane is holding three sevens.  When he re- *
      situates himself, Jane tosses in two cards. *

                                  JANE (CONT D) *
                    Two cards please. *

      Nancy deals him two new cards.  Daniel tosses in a card. *

                                    DANIEL *
                    I ll take one. *

      Nancy deals Daniel one new card. *

      INSERT -- Daniel picks up his fourth king. *

      Daniel allows himself a tiny secret smile. *

                                  JANE *
                    That good, eh?

      Daniel looks at him blankly.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Wow.  That good?

      Daniel goes with it.

                                  DANIEL
                    That good.  I can t lose.  

                                  JANE
                    Shame you only got chicken feed to 
                    bet with.

      Jane looks at his own cards. *

                    crush you and there s not a thing 
                    you can do but relax and enjoy it.

      He grins at Daniel, sits back.

                    What s the bet, kid?

      Daniel takes a beat.  Then affects to remember something...  
      He rummages in his pockets and comes up with one more chip...






































                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST       "Red-Handed"       GREEN 10/01/08      49.

                    I forgot.  

      A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CHIP, which he shows triumphantly 
      to Jane, and then places at the bottom of his small stack, 
      and pushes the stack carefully into the middle of the table.

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    The bet, my friend, is a hundred 
                    thousand six hundred dollars.

      Jane s smile vanishes and he looks deep into Daniel s eyes. 

                                  JANE 
                    I see you.

      Jane pushes in a hundred thousand six in chips to match the 
      bet.  Daniel savors the moment.

                                  DANIEL
                    You should trust me when I tell you 
                    things.  I told you I couldn t 
                    lose...

      He turns over his cards.

      Jane turns over his cards.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Not nice enough.  Straight flush.   *

      INSERT -- That s what Jane has alright.  In hearts.  *
        (6,7,8,9,10)           *

      Daniel looks like a unicorn just ran up and bit his arm off. 

                                  DANIEL
                    No.  That s impossible.

      Instinctively, he reaches out to take back the hundred 
      thousand dollar chip.  Nancy whips out a hand and grabs 
      Daniel s wrist in an iron grip.  Points to Jane with her free 
      hand.

      Jane rakes in the pot.  Picks out the hundred thousand dollar 
      chip and holds it up.  The chip has a hole bored through it, 
      so that Jim Meier could wear it round his neck.  Jane looks 
      through the hole at Daniel.  

                                  JANE
                    I see you.

      Daniel knows how to act cool when beat.  He rises 
      nonchalantly.

      in the hallway.

      Jim Meier approaches Daniel just as Daniel is about to leave.  
      He gets in Daniel s face and starts shoving him.

                    He d seen this tape with Jessica

                    I must have something to do it.     
                    I said sure I did.  Screw him.    
                    Like he was such a great husband 
                    and father, you know?  He called me 
                      a degenerate lowlife pimp, fired me 
                    then and there, and told me he 
                    would do everything in his power to 
                    get me out of Jessica s life.

      hits Jim hard.  Jim goes down.  Daniel wails on him.

                      I couldn t let that happen.

      Daniel tosses the bat back in his truck, takes all the money 
      off of Jim, finally yanking the poker chip from around his 
      neck.  He drags the body into his truck.

                      I remembered the stories they told in 
                    the room about mafia hitmen leaving a 
                    hand behind as a message.  I did it to

                                  JANE
                    I don t know.  Three hundred 
                    thousand, something like that.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Wow.

                                  CHO
                    Where is it?  The money.

                                  JANE
                    I spent it.

                                  CHO
                    On what?

                                  JANE
                    You know, stuff.

      Rigsby and Cho look disappointed.

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY5454

      Alexandra Yee sits next to her little tiny oxygen masked 
      MOTHER in her hospital bed.  A NURSE comes in and hands her a 
      big briefcase.

                                  NURSE
                    A really cute blonde guy left this 
                    for you at the front desk.

      Alexandra opens the case and looks inside.  As happy surprise 
      rises on her face...

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                      THE END
