Mr. and Mrs. Ben McKenna at the back of a motor coach
with their seven year old son, HANK. We do not see
much of the background which is receding from us.
THEY are studying the countryside from the windows at
each side of them. The CAMERA PULLS BACK down the
aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers. They
are a surprise, consisting of Arab men and women, with
an occasional civilian and French Army officer. The
CAMERA STOPS at the end of the bus.
Ben and Hank are looking intently out the window.
Jo's interest seems only casual.
HANK
Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa
before? It looks familiar.
Shooting through the McKenna's window at the landscape
moving by. It is semiarid desert. A line of blue-
grey mountains in the distant.
Jo studies the landscape.
JO
We saw the same scenery last summer
driving to Las Vegas.
Hank turns, and smiles slightly.

Ben gives his wife a look of exasperation, She smiles
at him.
HANK
Hey look - a camel!
Shooting through the McKenna's window. The bus
is
entering a small Arab village, Squat stone and
plaster
building, narrow streets, a few carts, donkeys
and one
camel. A
few pedestrians, mostly Arab men, few
women.
Ben puts his hand on Hank's shoulder.
JO
This isn't really Africa, Hank.
It's
French Morocco.
BEN
(To her)
Northern Africa.
HANK
Still seems like Las Vegas.
BEN
(Slightly indignant)
We're only a hundred miles north of
the Sahara Desert!
The bus is passing through the center of the town.
We
move past a few shops, everything looking drab and
meager. The sun is strong and hot.
Hank studies the scene outside.
He shrugs.

HANK
I dunno. In school they called it the
Dark Continent.
(He squints)
It's twice as bright as Indianapolis!
Jo and Ban smile at Hank.
BEN
Just wait till you see Marrakesh.
HANK
Marrakesh.
Sounds like a drink.
Ben runs his tongue across his lips.
BEN
You bet it does.
The bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open
desert once again. It looks parched and grim.
Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank
grows, restless. He looks about for something to do.
Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes.
Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her
place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the
bus and test its possibilities for adventure.
The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly
makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab
village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to
bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better
than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a
particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger.
In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to
grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only
succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman.
Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.
The startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her
face with her hands and gives a sharp cry,
With the bus still bumping and swaying, Hank staggers
a bit without realizing that he still has, hold of the
woman's veil.

The woman still covers her face, but from the seat
next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and
makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's
robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining
twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The
Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank,
repeating his demand.
People look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the
reason for the trouble.
The bus driver scans his rear vision mirror for the
source of the trouble behind him.
Hank looks up at the oncoming Arab, and retreats
uncertainly, not realizing he is still holding the
veil.
The Arab in the brown robes begins assaulting the boy
in furious Arabic, indicating that he wants the veil.
Two Arabs, and a veiled woman, rise in their seats
apparently disturbed by what the brown-clothed Arab is
saying. They being talking among themselves.
Ben and his wife, Jo, are straining from their back
seat and looking down the aisle to see what is wrong.
Ben looks at his wife quickly and then back, indicating
that Hank is involved.
Still staring straight at the Arab, both frightened
and fascinated by his verbal attack, Hank retreats.

Except for the French passengers, everyone in the bus
is in a state of disturbance. The Arab continues to
advance on Hank keeping up a steady tirade of Arabic.
Ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his
son and the oncoming Arab.
Hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother,
still with the veil in one hand. Ben faces the Arab
who stops, but continues his monologue for Ben's
benefit.
BEN
Now wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Simmer down.
The Arab continues pointing, talking.
From a nearby seat a young Frenchman in civilian clothes
rises quickly. The CAMERA PANS him to Ben and the
Arab. He pushes in between the pair.
LOUIS
(To Ben)
Pardon me.
He turns to the Arab, moves him back
a little, sharply
silences his attack, and then begins,
in Arabic, to
explain firmly that the boy meant, no
harm. It was an
accident. The Arab isn't convinced,
points to Hank.
The Frenchman leans toward Hank and takes the veil he
is still unconsciously holding. He hands it to the
Arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. The
Arab turns away carrying the veil. As the CAMERA PANS
him AWAY, we see the spectators resuming their seats,
growing quiet.
Hank and Jo relax. Ben addresses the Frenchman, a
pleasant-looking young man. He is LOUIS BERNARD.

She returns his smile.

Thank you, Mr. Bernard.

He holds out his hand to Hank, who takes it.
HANK

Louis Bernard slides into the seat next to Jo, who
moves over slightly. Ben sits on the other side so
that Hank and Jo are between himself and Louis. In
the rear windows behind them we see the retreating
landscape of French Morocco.
LOUIS
How different.
BEN
For Josephine. Called her Jo so long,
nobody knows her by any other name.
HANK
I do.
Mummy.
She smiles at Hank, rubs the back of his neck.
LOUIS
Now about the "accident." You see, a
Moslem woman never takes off her veil
in public under any circumstances.
HANK
They feed her intervaneously?
Louis looks at the boy with some surprise.
LOUIS
Quite a big word for such a small boy.

Ben seems happy to talk with somebody new.
BEN
We've been to a medical convention in
Paris. And while we were in Europe, I
thought I'd like to see Morocco again.
HANK
Daddy liberated Africa.
Louis laughs a little.
Ben seems uncomfortable.

Army field hospital, that's all.

She seems annoyed at Louis
Bernard's questioning.
She interrupts.

Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard?
He smiles at her.

You will naturally be stopping at the

LOUIS

They are hotels for tourists of good
taste.
The background, as seen through the windows of the
bus, indicates that we are in a built-up area.
It moves through the outskirts of Marrakesh, a somewhat
more populated section, although the streets are narrow
and crowded.
A persists with Louis Bernard.
JO
Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard?
LOUIS
Sometimes.
HANK
Do you eat snails.
LOUIS
When I'm lucky enough to got them.
HANK
If you ever get hungry, our garden
back home is full of snails.
LOUIS

Thank you for the invitation.
HANK
That's all right. We tried everything
to got rid of them. We never thought
of a Frenchman.
Even Jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues
on into Marrakesh, the three see to be fairly good
friends brought together by the artless charm of a
little boy.

It is now evening, and we are in the double bedroom
and single bedroom of the McKennas in the Hotel
Mamounia. We are able to see through into the single
room where Hank is, brushing his teeth while his mother
supervises his getting ready for bed. Jo is already
dressed for the evening in a smart-looking outfit.
Ben is by the chest of drawers and mirror. He just
lust finished putting on his shirt.
At the far end of the room there is a
balcony over-
looking the hotel gardens. By a small
table stands
Louis Bernard dressed with unobtrusive
good taste. He
is looking into the garden beyond. On
the table are
glasses and a shaker of martinis.
In the single room occupied by Hank. Jo is putting
his clothes away.
Hank, having brushed his teeth and
rinsed his mouth, emerges from the bathroom. He wears
pajamas, but still has his shoos on.
HANK
How about it, mummy?
One chorus.
JO
I'm a little out of form, Hank.
HANK
One chorus, and that's all.
JO
(Smiles)
All right, Mr. Hammerstein.

HANK
Let's go.
He tap dances a vamp introduction to the song. He's
quite professional. Then he stops, takes a pose, and
begins singing in a small, but not untalented voice.
HANK
When I was lust a little boy
I asked my mother "What will I be?"
Will I be handsome?
Will I be rich?
Here's what she said to me:
Jo takes up the song. Her voice is obviously
professional, but beyond that, quite beautiful.
JO
Que Sera Sera, whatever will
be will be
The future's not ours to see
Que Sera Sera
What will be will be
Que Sera Sera.
Louis Bernard looks up with some surprise, fascinated
and delighted with Jo's singing ability.
Ben, who is putting on his tie, pauses, and listens.
There is a slight smile of pleasure and affection on
his face. Hank's voice comes over:
HANK
When I was just a child in school
I asked my teacher "What should I try"
Should I paint pictures?
Should I sing songs?
This was her wise reply:
Jo does a turn, takes Hank's hand and he does a turn
around her as she sings.

Hank looks up happily to his mother, as she sings to

to the next verse.
JO
Now I have children of my own
They ask their mother "What will I

Will I be handsome?
Will I be rich?
I tell them tenderly:
They sing the chorus in harmony together.
HANK AND JO

What will be will be

Just before they finish the song, there is a loud
knocking at the outside door. The song trails off.
HANK
(Disgusted)
There goes our sock finish!
Ben goes to the door, tightening his tie on the way.
He opens it. A waiter is there with a tray of food.
WAITER

Right in there.
The waiter heads for the single bedroom, as the CAMERA
PANS Ben back to the dresser.
LOUIS

He said the manager is going to send

The waiter nods politely, goes out the door.

Thank you.
He goes toward the balcony for the drink.
LOUIS
Were you on the American stage, Mrs.

Jo turns, and gives Ben a meaningful glance.
"The

Ben gives her a look of comic disparagement.
Louis comes up, hands her a martini.
LOUIS

Jo takes a sip of her drink, with some, frustration.

What do you do for a living?
LOUIS

JO
What?
LOUIS
Whatever gives the best profit.
She puts down
her drink with some exasperation. As
she does, she
glances back toward Ben. He's getting
his coat, but
pauses to give her a slight smile and a
look that says
"You're wasting your time."
JO
(More firmly)
Just what are you buying, or selling,
now in Marrakesh?

The CAMERA PANS Jo past Ben to the door. He has just
put on his coat, and turns to follow her to the door.
She opens it, and standing in the corridor is a
silhouetted figure. We cannot see the face. Jo
switches on a light, which reveals a rather studious
looking man of medium height standing there.
BEN
Excusez moi, mais is cherche la chambre
do Monsieur Montgomery.
Jo looks at Ben helplessly, who looks over his shoulder
toward Louis Bernard for help in translating the French.
As the McKennas turn, the man in the doorway lifts
himself on tiptoe a little and gives a sharp look in
the direction of Louis Bernard.
The man immediately turns his attention back to Ben,
and begins talking in broken English.

As Ben closes the door, we see that Louis Bernard has
been advancing into the room for a better look at the
man in the doorway,
The McKennas turn back to the room. Louis Bernard's
face his changed slightly to the more serious. Hank's
voice is heard off:

Mummy -- I can't cut this meat!
JO
I'll do it, Hank.
She goes out of the room, glancing briefly at Louis.
LOUIS
(To Ben)
May I use your telephone?
Ben gestures that the phone is his. The CAMERA PANS
Louis to the phone, which he picks up, and begins
talking in French asking first for the operator, and a
certain number. Beyond that his conversation is a
mystery, because his face reveals nothing. (Possibly
speaks Arabic.)
As Louis Bernard talks on the phone, Ben goes to
pick
up his drink. He comes back into the room, as JO
enters
once again from the bedroom. She looks at Louis,
then
at Ben who shrugs his shoulders. Louis finishes
his
phone conversation, hangs up.
LOUIS
I am terribly sorry, but I cannot go
to dinner with you tonight.
I had neglected an important matter which now requires
my attention. Perhaps, another night...
He bows briefly and moves towards the door. The
McKenna's look at each other quite bewildered.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
The CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an
Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has
a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on
cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding
in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently
serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen.
The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled
with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes.
Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in
the background. The light is supplied principally
from candles.
As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO
REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving.

A headwaiter, wearing a fez, comes forward.
The headwaiter bows slightly.
HEADWAITER
Bonsoir, Madame, Monsieur.
BEN
Good evening. My name is McKenna.
HEADWAITER
Of course.
The hotel phoned.
Follow
me please.
The headwaiter turns and moves into the restaurant,
The McKennas follow him, the CAMERA PANNING them. Ben
is interested in everything he sees. Jo glances at
the diners, and then a look of surprise starts through
her face.
They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions
eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are
the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel
Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had
stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man
next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass
them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking
over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner.
The headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions
directly behind those of the two people who stared at
them.
HEADWAITER
I think you will find this comfortable.
He bows and departs. Jo seems disturbed, looks around
as if trying to find another seat.
JO
Ben...
BEN
Sit down, Jo, please.
People are

She sits on the far cushion. Her movements are graceful
and easy as she sits tailor fashion. Ben, being tall

First he kneels, and then with much struggle manages
to fold his long legs underneath him.
He turns to Jo, expecting to find her amused at his
antics, but instead her face is serious, and she has a
secret look about her. She leans close to him.
JO
You're right. People are staring at
us.
BEN
What people?
She gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people
sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but
all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns
back.
JO
They stared at us when we went into
the hotel.
BEN
Jo, will you stop imagining things?
Ben looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look
behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind
him also turns. They are staring directly at each
other.
MRS. DRAYTON
Good evening.
Hearing her voice, Jo turns, looks, and so does the
man with Mrs. Drayton. The woman then turns half way
around toward Jo.
MRS. DRAYTON
You must think me awfully rude. I've
been staring at you ever since I saw
you at the hotel.
Jo slides a glance of "see" at Ben.

But nobody reads it.
Jo is staring at the entrance to the restaurant. Mrs.
Drayton follows her glance. The two men stop talking,
and eating, and also look.
Louis Bernard is standing in the entrance of the
restaurant. On his arm is a rather elegantly dressed
woman. She is also handsome and graceful. As he stands
waiting for the headwaiter, Louis Bernard looks around
the restaurant. His eyes stop when he comes to the
McKennas. He looks directly at them without the
slightest sign of recognition.

Jo and Ben stare back. There is resentment in Jo's
eyes, and conjecture in Ben's.
The headwaiter comes up to Louis Bernard, exchanges a
few words with him which we cannot hear, and then leads
the couple to a set of cushions in the far corner of
the room. As he moves away from the entrance, Louis
Bernard does not look at the McKennas.
As the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners
watch them -- the Draytons out of idle curiosity, but
the McKennas with growing astonishment as they realize
that Bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or
speaking to them. Jo turns back to Ben.
JO
Well just what do you think of that?
First he promises to take us to dinner --
BEN
Look, we only met him today. We can't
expect him to change his whole life --
JO
Oh, Ben!
What's the matter with you?!
BEN
Nothing!
What's the matter with you?!
JO
I just don't like to be both privately

BEN
Can you blame him? Turning down an
old married couple for a date with a
girl like that?
JO
We're not an old married couple! All
right -- He's a heel. I don't

Ben glares in Bernard's direction, and then picks up a
chicken leg.
JO
I don't know why Ben gets so worked up
over unimportant things.
Ben looks a her slowly, and with some amazement. Then
his eyes lift a little and he sees the headwaiter

three fingers. Ben looks down at the chicken leg. He
is holding it gripped in his fist. This is too much.
He throws the leg down to his plate in disgust.

Over in the far corner of the restaurant, the lady
with Louis Bernard leans forward and murmurs something
in French. Her gaze is across the room in the direction
of the McKennas.
WOMAN
C'est les deux que cherchez? (Is that
the couple you are looking for?)
Louis turns slightly and looks.
He glances back at
her and nods significantly.
LOUIS
Oui.
(Yes.)
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
The main hallway and waiting room of the Police Station
in Marrakesh. French and Arab personnel move up and
down the wide hallway from one doorway to another.
There is a babble of voices and the sound of phones
heard off. The McKennas and Drayton are seated on a
long bench, waiting to be called into the inner office
of the Police Inspector. Drayton sits next to Ben.
It is hot. Jo has eyes for everything, but Ben seems
to be somewhat impatient. He looks at his watch for
the third or fourth time in a minute.
Drayton notices him studying his watch. He leans to
him, and at the same time wipes off the side of his on
face with a handkerchief.
DRAYTON
Once we talk to the police inspector,
I'll do my best to out some of the red
tape.
JO
I have to stretch.
She gets up and saunters away, looking around the police
station for whatever there is to see. Drayton speaks
to Ben with reassuring geniality.
DRAYTON
I'm afraid the questions will go on
till doomsday, if you admit knew this
chap Bernard before.
BEN
I didn't know him at all.
We only met
yesterday on a bus.
DRAYTON
They're a cynical lot, these French --
they might refuse to believe that.
BEN
They'll have to believe me.
It's true.
DRAYTON
It might sound a bit odd,
from their
point of view. They saw
the poor chap
whispering to you ... and
then they
saw you writing something
down...

Ben looks at Drayton, waiting for his to go on.
DRAYTON
The question is, are you going to show
them what you wrote down?
Before Ben can say any more, a policeman opens the
door leading to the Police Inspector's office. He
calls out.
Jo turns around at the sound of the door opening, and
Ben and Drayton start to rise from the bench.
The policeman steps aside, holding the door, as a Police
Inspector comes out of the office from behind him. He
is a short, heavy-built-dark man. He does not smile.
The Inspector walks a few steps into the corridor,
stops. Ben, Jo and Drayton approach him. Drayton
speaks first.
DRAYTON
Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les
McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne
parlent pas francais et ils m'ont
demand de traduire.
The Inspector answers in English.
INSPECTOR
Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a
translator will not be necessary.
(To McKenna)
Won't you come inside, Monsieur, Madame?
He stops aside, and wait.
INSPECTOR
(To Drayton)
Do to the kindness to wait. I might
have questions for you later.
He motions to the McKennas. Jo goes past him first,
into the office, followed by Ben, Drayton returns to
the bench, and watches the trio as the office door
closes on them.
A medium-sized office, saved from plainness of civil
service decor by a few personal decorations of the
Inspector.

He waves the McKenna to chairs, as he goes around behind
his desk and remains standing. Ben and Jo sit down.
The Inspector looks at some papers on his desk, then
holds out his hand.
INSPECTOR
(Precisely)
Your passports, please.
Ben looks at Jo, who fishes for them in her purse.
She takes them out, hands them to Ben, who hands them
to the Inspector. He scrutinizes them. Uncomfortable,
Ben retreats to a chair and sits down, waiting. The
inspector checks the pictures against the people he
sees sitting in his office, then puts the passports
down on his desk.
INSPECTOR
You entered French Morocco four days
ago.
BEN
That's right.
INSPECTOR
You are a doctor, monsieur?
BEN
A surgeon.
A tourist, and an American
citizen.
INSPECTOR
Three good reasons why you should have
nothing in common with Louis Bernard.
BEN
I didn't have.
INSPECTOR
You were recently in Paris?
BEN
A medical convention.
INSPECTOR
You come to
Marrakesh with him in the
same bus.
You drank an apritif with
him in your
hotel room. And you ate
at the same
restaurant last night.
JO
But at different tables.
The Inspector's eyes study her briefly, as if her
comment was an unnecessary interruption. Then his
eyes return to Ben.

INSPECTOR
So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to
you?
BEN
I met him yesterday -- on the bus --
for the first time in my life.
The Inspector begins to let his skepticism be seen.
INSPECTOR
(ironically)
And yet -- out of five
thousand people --
In a great market place
-- he comes to
you when he is about to
die! Is that
the action of a casual
acquaintance,
monsieur?
BEN
(Obstinate)
I know nothing about Louis Bernard.
INSPECTOR
No? Not even, I suppose, that he was
an agent of the Duxieme Bureau?
BEN
What's that?
INSPECTOR
Perhaps you have also never head of
the American F.B.I.?
(Sadly)
It would be so much more easy for both
of us, monsieur, if you would cease to
pretend.
BEN
Now, look here...
INSPECTOR
(Patiently)
The dead man found out what he had
been sent here to discover. That is
why he was kill-ed. He told you what
he had discovered. Why? Because he
placed complete confidence in you.
Voila.
BEN
Boy, you not only ask the questions
you also answer them -- Wait a minute
let me ask you a question.
INSPECTOR
Indeed, Monsieur?

BEN
Assuming Bernard trusted me as
implicitly as you say, I would never
reveal anything he said to me, would
I?
INSPECTOR
Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes
find it desirable to betray a
confidence?
BEN
Let's get something straight. I'm a
tourist traveling for pleasure. I
somehow got involved in an unfortunate
incident. I came down here to make a
simple statement of fact, and not to
be subjected to a police grilling.
INSPECTOR
Monsieur, I would like....
BEN
(Interrupting)
Now hold your horses!
Just hold them.
The door opens suddenly.
The two men look up.
A policeman opens the door and leans in.
POLICE TWO
Inspecteur. On demande Monsieur McKenna

As he speaks, the policeman nods in the direction of
Ben.
The Inspector impatiently tries to dismiss the officer
with a gesture.
INSPECTOR
Laissez nous, nous sommes occuppes.
Ben motions to the policeman to stay where he is
BEN
Wait a minute. A telephone call for
me?
The policeman at the door looks at the Inspector
briefly. The Inspector is disconcerted, but doesn't
tell the man what to say, so he turns back to Ben and
nods.

The policeman points over his shoulder to in outside

INSPECTOR

Mais enfin, voyons!
BEN
I'll take the call now.
You just take

He goes out the door, closing it behind him. The
Inspector sits down heavily. Then he looks up at Jo.
INSPECTOR
Madame McKenna.
JO
I don't know a thing,
The CAMERA PANS Ban as he follows the policeman down
the outside corridor, past Drayton who is still sitting
on a bench and watching Ben somewhat anxiously, and
into a small plain office.
The policeman enters the small office
first. There is
a desk, more like a table, and a phone
is lying on it
off the hook. The policeman picks it
up, and hands it
to Ben. Ben holds it without speaking
a second, and
waves the policeman out.
The policeman is indifferent.
He leaves.
Ben puts
the phone to his ear.
BEN
Hello.
A robed Arab is sitting in a chair holding a telephone.
The room is part of a rather elaborate Moorish house.
The Arab speaks in accented English.
ARAB

As Ben answers, he idly looks through the open doorway
toward Drayton sitting on the bench outside.
BEN
This is McKenna.
Who's calling me?
The Arab doesn't bother to identify himself.
ARAB
You tell
even one word of that Louis
Bernard
whispered to you in the market-
place --
your little boy will be in
serious
danger.
The Arab starts to hang up.
There is an audible click in the receiver held in Ben's
hand.
BEN
Hello.
There is no answer. Ben lowers the phone slightly,
looks at it a minute, then continues on downward with
it, returning the receiver to the phone cradle. He
stands a brief moment in thought, then half turns toward
Drayton sitting in the corridor outside. He motions
to Drayton to join him in the office
BEN
Drayton!
The Englishman gets up and comes into the small office.
BEN
Didn't your wife say she was taking
Hank straight back to the hotel?
DRAYTON
As I recall.
Why?
Ben picks up the phone, hands it to Drayton.
BEN
Call her. Somebody just threatened me
about Hank. See if he's all right.

DRAYTON
At least nobody's seen her.

what's going on.
DRAYTON
It's so unlike my wife...
BEN
I'll finish up with the police and

DRAYTON
Right. But don't worry. Probably
some stupid misunderstanding.

As Ben enters the office, both Jo and the Inspector
look up him inquiringly.
JO
Who was it, Ben?
Ben adopts as casual an air as he can under the
circumstances. He doesn't sit down. He speaks more
to the Inspector than to his wife, avoiding her eyes.
BEN
It was the Concierge at the Hotel. He
heard we were being held by the Police
and thought there was some way he could
help us.
JO
That was nice of him.
BEN
(Looking at Inspector)
I told him if we weren't back there in
fifteen minutes to call the American
Consulate in Casablanca.
The Inspector has realised that he won't get any more
out of Ben.
INSPECTOR
(charmingly)
But, Monsieur, if you had only told me
in the first place, that you wished to
consult with your consul!
Ben gives him a look.
BEN
Let's go, Jo.
INSPECTOR
There is just one small formality. I
must request you to sign a statement
of the facts.
BEN

They enter the room, close the door. Ben goes
immediately to their luggage, specifically to his
medical bag. He opens it, and begins looking for
something. Jo tosses her handbag on the bed, looks
around the suite.
JO
Frankly, I'm exhausted.
Don't you
feel well?
He doesn't answer her.
She shrugs, and starts for the
telephone.
JO
I'll call Mrs. Drayton and tell her
we're back. She can bring Hank up

Ben takes two pills out of a small bottle.

bottle, and his medical bag.
BEN
I hope we don't.
JO
Then stop playing Rasputin. I only
said I was going to call Mrs. Drayton.
She reaches for the phone again.
He turns.
BEN
Wait 'til I come back.
She hesitates.
He goes into the bathroom, the CAMERA

She is puzzled with him. Shrugs her shoulders. Slumps
to a sitting position on the bed. She ribs her face
and her eyes with a gesture of fatigue. There is the
sound of running water in the bathroom. When she looks
up again, Ben is standing in front of her. In one
hand he his two capsules, in the other a glass of water.
He holds them out to her. His manner is casual and
pleasant.
BEN
Something to relax you.
She looks at the pills.
JO
I'm so relaxed I'm tired.
You take
them.
BEN
Jo, they're for you.
I'm the doctor.

Ben takes a deep breath.
BEN
Jo, I make my living knowing when and
how to administer medicine. You'll
feel a lot better tomorrow if you take
these today. But you don't think so.
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.
JO
I'm listening.
BEN
There's something about Louis Bernard,
the police station, and this whole spy
business that I haven't told you yet.
He holds out the capsules.
BEN
This is the price of curiosity.
Despite herself she's intrigued.
JO
What could it be?
BEN
There's one way to find out.
She reaches out, takes the capsules, pops them into
her mouth. He hands her the water, she drinks some of
it.
JO
All right, Doctor McKenna.
I am now
relaxed and listening.
Ben moves away from Jo, puts the glass on a dresser.

Just a minute. This whole thing strange
right from the very beginning.
As he talks he moves about the room first one way,
then the other, watching Jo closely, almost as if he
were trying to lull her into sleep, or hypnotize her.
BEN
It was no accident that Louis Bernard
helped us out on the bus, and struck
up a conversation. You were right
about him.
JO
See.
BEN
Yes...yes, you were right about him.
He was...was strange.
Jo is beginning to appear a little drowsy.
Ben watches
her closely.
JO
I know all that.
Get to the surprise.
BEN
He got talking to us because he was on
the lookout for a suspicious married
couple.
JO
Nothing suspicious about us.
BEN
He was wrong. It was a different
married couple.
JO
And he was killed before he found them.
BEN
No. He found them. In the restaurant.
Last night. That's why he was killed.
JO
You'll be telling me next it was Mr.

BEN

JO

He prevents her.
BEN
Listen to me. And listen carefully.
She comes awake more, studies him.
BEN
That phone call I received at the police
station.
She nods dumbly.
BEN
It wasn't from the concierge at the
hotel. It was from somebody with a
foreign voice who said if I told anybody
one word of what. Louis Bernard
whispered to me in the market place
that something...something might happen
to...to, to Hank.
She comes suddenly as awake as she can.
JO
Hank?
Why H... ?
BEN
They've taken him away.
She pushes herself to her feet. She is fighting the
drug successfully. She almost shouts at him.
JO
Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the
hotel. She is downstairs!
He stands up.
BEN
Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never
came back here! And Hank didn't either!

She hits him away.
JO
All this time you, knew Hank was gone,
and you wouldn't tell me.
BEN
I wasn't sure, until now.
She is fighting the drug which is beginning to take
over again.
JO
He's my child more than yours!
I had

He takes hold of her again. She struggles fiercely,
trying to get away, to hit him, kick him.
JO
Let go of me! I'll never never never
forget this! We've got to find Hank!
We've got to find him.
He struggles silently with her, trying to push her
down on the bed, and hold her until the drug does its
work.
JO
You think you're the only one strong
enough to take anything? Ben, Ben, I
hate you, with my whole heart.
(She starts to cry)
Hank! Where is Hank? Hank, oh Hank!
Get him, Ben. Please. You damn
miserable human...how could
anybody...do...
He has forced her down on
the bed, pinioning her arms,
even though her legs still
struggle somewhat. She is
having a hard time seeing,
or talking. Her head waves
back and forth. It's hard

Her legs grow quiet. Her arm relax somewhat. She is
still straining to move her head, and talk, but all
that comes out are unintelligible sounds and a half
moan of anguish. Then she's gone. Ben looks at her a
moment, relaxes his grip. He lowers his head down
against hers. He seem to be fighting the desire to
cry. He finally gains control of himself. He lifts
his head slightly, gives her a soft and heartfelt kiss
on the cheek.
BEN
(Softly)
Darling, if somebody did this to me,
I'd say just what you said.
Ben stands up. The weight of unhappiness is heavy on
him. He gets a blanket from the foot of the bed and
covers her up. He brushes back the hair from her
forehead. Then he turns, and the CAMERA PANNING HIM
OVER to the door. He takes one last look at Jo, then
goes out the door, closing it softly behind him.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
As the light of sunset fades into growing darkness,
the muezzin stands atop the minaret, arms raised to
the heavens and giving out his high, sing-song call to
prayer. The call is taken up by another voice somewhere
in the city, and then another, and still another --
until the prayer is a continuous round of chanting
starting close, moving away, almost fading, and then
returning.
The chant of the call to prayer can be heard In the
background. We are in the single bedroom, of Hank
McKenna. There is one lamp burning over the empty
bed, and another on the wall over the dresser. Ben is
despondently carrying Hank's small suits, and other
articles of clothing from the closet to in open suitcase
on the bed. As he crosses with the final armload of
clothes, he looks out of the door into the large
bedroom.
In the mirror, on the far wall, Ben can see the
reflection of his wife stirring in her bed. He watches
as she drags herself up into-a half-pitting position.

room, the CAMERA PANNING him.
As Ben enters the main room, he glances at his wife.
Jo's eyes are beginning to open and close, and she
shakes her head a little, as she tries to recover from
the sedative he gave her.
Ben puts down Hank's suitcase, and crosses to their
own luggage, the CAMERA PANNING him in such a way as
to keep Jo in the background. He opens the suitcases,
and begins taking clothes out of the dresser drawers
to pack them.
Jo opens her eyes and looks about
her. She tries to
straighten up her hair a little.
She takes in the
room, and then as though a sudden
thought strikes her,
she looks toward the open door of
her missing son's
bedroom.
The empty boy's room as seen from her viewpoint.
Ben pauses in his packing a moment to observe her.
The he continues on with his work.

him, past his shoulder, we see his wife staring in his
direction. He continues to talk, although he finds it
difficult to be matter-of-fact, moving back and forth
from the dresser drawers to the suitcases.
BEN
Both the Draytons are definitely gone.
The hotel register says they come from
London. Drayton told the concierge he
was a college professor. The only
thing to do now is to get out of
Marrakesh.
Her face shows a slight rise in reaction, mostly
puzzlement.
BEN
As individuals we're helpless here.
And because of that phone call, we
can't bring the police in on it. I
even thought of taking that chance.
He pauses, and glances at her to see how she reacts.
She just stares at his her eyes a little dull.
BEN
But connect Hank's disappearance to
Louis Bernard's murder. And the first
thing they'd do would be to make me
tell them Louis Bernard's message.
That...that could be, Hank's...well,
it wouldn't help him.
Ben goes to take some of Jo's clothes out of drawer,
and comes up with a play script. He looks at it a
moment, then back to Jo. Her eyes observe it, but she
says nothing. Ben continues on to the suitcase, where
he lays the script in with the clothes.
BEN

Jo doesn't stir, she
just stares at him.
BEN
So we're going to London to find him.
He looks at her for a reaction. She turns her head
away from him as if in disagreement, or perhaps fighting
for control of her emotions. Ben crosses to her, the
CAMERA PANNING him. He sits down on the edge of the
bed, and takes out the small notebook from his coat.
He opens it. In careful, low tones, he reads Louis
Bernard's message.

We're going to try this Ambrose Chappell
and if he has anything at all to do
with this, I'm going to offer him every
cent I've got to got Hank back. This
Ambrose Chappell guy is our only hope.
Understand, Jo?
Jo puts out a weary hand as though to dismiss the piece
of paper, and all that it contains. Again she turns
her head away. Slowly Ben puts the paper back into
pocket. He speaks with a shade more urgency in his
voice.
BEN
We've only got a few hours, Jo! We
have to got up and start moving.
Ben gets up, and the CAMERA PANS him to
the dresser
and the suitcases. Then he pauses and
looks back at
Jo who is still looking away. Jo turns
back to look
at Ben. She is studying him now as if
she has just
seen him for the first time. Her eyes
are more alert.
Ben turns back to his packing.
BEN
I've paid the bill, and there's a car
waiting downstairs. As soon as I pack,

Ben kisses her on the cheek. She buries her head in

to find in answer to her question.

Buchanan continues quietly.
BUCHANAN

assassination plot -- here, in London.

Buchanan turns to her and speaks gently, but with force.
BUCHANAN
Anything you tell me will be in the
most absolute confidence.
Ben starts to interrupt.
BEN
That might be true, but --
Buchanan holds up a hand to interrupt him.
BUCHANAN
(To Jo)
Your son is the trump card these people
hold. He's perfectly safe -- for the
moment.
JO
And when they've done what they're
going to do, they'll let him go. So
all we have to do is wait.

BUCHANAN
(Gently, to Jo)
No, Mrs. McKenna. If they consider
the boy a nuisance, afterwards -- I'm
afraid --
He gestures.
BEN
Now, don't try to frighten us, Mr.
Buchanan.
BUCHANAN
It's exactly what I'm trying to do --
frighten you. I'm trying to prevent a
man being murdered here, in London.
The Pressure on Jo is beginning to weaken her.
Buchanan
persists.
BUCHANAN
If you don't tell me all you know, you
become an accessory before the fact of
murder. In English law, you become
just short of murderers yourselves.
Jo, a creature of emotion, is bewildered and upset and
tired of fighting Buchanan. She is ready to give in.
She looks to Ben.
JO
Ben, what can we do by ourselves?
We
need --
BEN
(Interrupts)
You worked on the wrong McKenna, Mr.
Buchanan. Louis Bernard talked to me,
not my wife.
Buchanan turns to Ben.
BUCHANAN
Then you tell me.
BEN
Bernard spoke in French, and I don't
understand a word of the language.
There is a pause while Buchanan studies Ben.
BUCHANAN
And what did you write down on a piece
of paper?

Ben stands there.
He has no answer.
Jo gets up from
her seat.
JO
Ben -- maybe they could find those
people, and Hank, before --
BEN
(Interrupts)
Maybe. Maybe isn't good enough for
me, and it shouldn't be good enough
for you.
JO
You act as if you're the only one who's
concerned about Hank.
BEN
Now Jo, I didn't mean it that way. We
made up our minds what we were going
to do -- now let's try to stick to it.
Ben turns to Buchanan.
BEN
We'd like to cooperate with you, Mr.
Buchanan -- but -- but we just can't.
BUCHANAN
(quietly)
I have a son of my own.
I don't know
what I'd do...
Jo looks at Ben appealingly. Even Ben is uncertain
now, trying to evaluate things quickly,
BEN
Well, maybe if we --
He is interrupted by a tapping at the door. Buchanan
looks up, as do the McKennas. The CAMERA PANS Buchanan
to the door as he opens it himself. His assistant
Woburn is there. There is a whispered conversation.
Woburn retreats, and Buchanan turns back to the room.
BUCHANAN
(Matter-of-factly)
A phone call for you, Mrs. McKenna.
Buchanan crosses and picks up the telephone from the
desk.
BUCHANAN
Put the call through here, please.
He pauses a moment, then hands the phone to Jo.

BUCHANAN
Mrs. McKenna.
Jo steps forward, takes the phone hesitantly, looking
at Bon for reassurance.
He nods to her. Buchanan,
meanwhile, has casually, but quickly gone out of the
office, closing the door behind him.
In the outer office Woburn quickly hands Buchanan the
phone, who puts it to his ear.
Jo puts the phone to her ear.
She speaks hesitantly.
JO
Hallo.
We hear a voice on filter.
MRS. DRAYTON
Mrs. McKenna?
JO
Yes.
MRS. DRAYTON
This is Mrs. Drayton. You remember
me?
Jo pales and seems about to faint.
JO
Mrs...Drayton?
Ben reacts with surprise, and gives a stop or two
forward. He is tense.
Jo recovers herself.
JO
Where's Hank? Where have you got him?
Buchanan puts out a hand. Woburn places a pen in it,
and slides a pad along the desk under it. We hear
Mrs. Drayton's voice over the filter.

MRS. DRAYTON
He's here. With me. You mustn't worry
about him, really you mustn't.
Buchanan pauses, with nothing to write.
Jo shows some relief, but she's still deeply concerned.
JO
Where is he?
Where have you got him?
MRS. DRAYTON
I expect you'd like to speak to him,
wouldn't you?
JO
Yes.
Please, please!
She looks towards Ben.
Ben moves close to her, trying to pick up a little of
the conversation from the phone. She tips the phone a
little in his direction.
JO
Hello.
Hello, Hank?
MRS. DRAYTON
Just a minute.
HANK
Mummy?
Mummy is that you?
Jo fights sudden tears.
JO
Oh, Hank, Hank darling, are you really
all right?
HANK
I'm a little scared, mummy. But I'm
all right -- I guess. I miss you mummy,
I miss you so much.
She bursts out crying, unable to hold herself back any
more. Ben takes the phone from her quickly.

BEN
(Desperation)
Hank, where are you? For Heaven's
sake, where are you?!!
HANK
Welbeck eight --
There is a sudden click. Ben rattles the receiver.
All he gets is a dial tone. He hangs up, and turns to
Jo who is quietly crying, trying to get over the shock
of hearing Hank. Buchanan enters the office as Ben
takes jo by the shoulders and turns her around to him.
He takes out a handkerchief, hands it to her. She
covers her face for a moment, then dries her tears.
She looks up at Ben.
JO
He was scared.
She starts sobbing soundlessly again, her body shaking.
Ben takes her in his arms to quiet her. She quiets
down slowly. Buchanan standing behind the desk doesn't
look at the pair, but he speaks first.
BUCHANAN
It was a London telephone exchange.
Woburn comes in the office, goes to Buchanan.
WOBURN
(Tersely)
Public call box -- West One.
He shrugs as if to say "that's the end." Buchanan
nods for Woburn to leave. Woburn does, casting a side
glance of sympathy toward Jo and Ben. He closes the
door quietly behind him.
Buchanan looks at the pair, and sighs in a manner that
suggests he recognizes defeat, when he sees it.
Jo now has herself under control. She leaves Ben's
arms, and returns to her seat to gather herself
together, dry her eyes. Ben turns to Buchanan.

He reaches for a pad and pencil.
He scribbles something

BUCHANAN
You may change your minds.
If you do,
this number will reach me.
He tears off a page of the paper, and hands it to Ben.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
In a suite at Savoy's Hotel we see the door open and
Ben and Jo McKenna are ushered into the suite by the
frock-coated desk clerk. Behind them are two assistant
porters carrying their bags. In the foreground, through
which we are SHOOTING, are three large baskets of
assorted flowers. They are obviously gift of greeting
to London. The porters move off into the bedroom with
the bags. They lay out the bags, open the drapes and
windows, etc. The desk clerk turns on the lights in
the main room, as the McKennas look about.
DESK CLARK
Everything all right, sir?
BEN
It's fine.
Just fine.
DESK CLARK
(Hands Ben key)
Your room key, Sir.
Ben takes it. The
porters come out of the
bedroom.
Ben reaches in his
pocket, comes up with a
bill, hands
it to one of them.
The porter touches his
forehead in
sort of a salute.
The porters exit. The
desk clerk
follows, pauses at
the door.
DESK CLERK
And I hope you have a most pleasant
stay in London.
Both Jo and Ben turn to look at him briefly.
He is
smiling, they are not.
BEN
Oh yes.
Thank you.
The desk clerk goes out the door, carefully closing
it. The McKenna are alone. Jo turns to look at the
basket of flowers, and crosses TOWARD THE CAMERA to
look at them. She takes a card in her hand, attached
to the largest basket, reads the note.

(To Ben)
It's from the Panell's. "Welcome home,

JO stands there a brief moment, takes a breath, and
looks at to otter two cards.
JO
Cindy and Jan.
(To Ben)
You don't know Cindy and Jan.
Ben puts the room key down on a table, and the CAMERA
PANS him over to a smaller desk containing the telephone
and telephone books. He sits down at the desk, and
reaches for the general telephone directory. He begins
flipping through the pages. Jo turns from the flowers
and walks over to him. He pauses, takes out of his
pocket the black notebook on which he wrote Louis
Bernard's message. He tears out the page, hands the
notebook to Jo.
BEN
You'd better keep your book.
He returns to the telephone book, after looking at the
note and placing it on the desk in front of him.
JO
What are you looking for?
BEN
The only clue we have which might lead
us to Hank. The place and identity of
Mr. Ambrose Chappell.
He finds what is apparently the right page.
His finger
begins to trace down the list of names.
INSERT
Ben's finger going down the column of
names. "C - C - CHAPPELL - ABRAHAM

There it is -- big as life -- Ambrose

He returns his eye to the book, as Jo leans closer to
watch him. He begins writing down the name and address,
and murmurs half-aloud as he writes --
BEN
Ambrose Chappell - Sixty-one Burdett
Street. Camden Town. Telephone -
Gulliver 6198.
He reaches for the phone, after putting the book to
one side. He lifts the receiver, but Jo reaches out
to stop him. He looks at her with some annoyance.
BEN
Don't you want me to call him?
JO
I can't make up my mind, Ben. I'm jut
scared to death. I'm afraid we'll do
the wrong thing.
BEN
(Quietly)
I'll try not to be too wrong.
He picks up the phone.
JO
What are you going to say?
BEN
I'll offer to keep my mouth shut and
give him all the money we have -- for
Hank.
(To phone)
Operator. Get me ...
(Consults address)
Gulliver 6198. Thank you.
He waits and at that moment there is a sudden, loud,
but happy pounding on the door. Both Jo and Ben jump
and turn toward the door, almost frightened.
Muffled shouts are heard of "Open up! We know you're
in there! Jo! It's us! We're here!"
JO
I go.
She heads for the door, and Ben sits there squirming
with suspense, and annoyance at being interrupted.
Beyond him, Jo opens the door, and immediately four
people pour in. They are Val Parnall and his wife.
Helen, intelligent, sophisticated, and full of life.

The other two are Cindy Fontaine, an American music
hall entertainer, now in England, around forty-five,
more of a character actress than a lead -- and Jan
Peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer Jo's age,
smart-looking, but talkative and slightly
scatterbrained. The women come in first, Helen Parnell
throws her arms around Jo in affectionate greeting.
HELEN
Jo!
You look wonderful!
Val Parnell follows the women in and closes the door
behind him.
VAL
When we got your wire I couldn't believe
it. What were you doing down in
Morocco?
JO
Sightseeing.
CINDY
Two minutes later Helen was on the
phone to me. And I had to call Jan.
JAN
You're the perfect answer to what London
needs, Jo. This week's the dullest
thing since my first show.
Jo has disengaged herself from Helen.
Shakes hands
with Val.
JO
Hello,
Val. Jo and I want to thank
all of
you for the lovely flowers.
But you
shouldn't have. We might not
be here
long!
Ben has been watching them anxiously, torn between
hanging up the phone, or waiting for his call to go
through. The call finally comes through.
BEN
Hello, hello? Is this Ambrose Chappell?
Mr. Ambrose Chappell? All right...I

How clever! Especially in such a
psychosomatic business. Why --

CINDY
You don't know what psychosomatic means.
JAN
I do too! It means when your mind

CINDY
The doctor's trying to talk on the
phone.
Ben tries to be casual and amiable.
BEN
It's only business.
It's nothing.
Helen Parnell flops into a chair.
HELEN
Business is everything.
Shhh.
They all fall silent, and watch Ben.
He is
uncomfortable.
BEN
Hello?

voice down)
Mr. Ambrose Chappell?

BEN
Well, uh, uh .. are you going to be at
your address for a while? Uh huh,
it's just some business. Nothing big.
Uh huh, well thank you. I'll drop
around.
Ben hangs up, and turns to the group. He tries to be
as casual as possible. He picks up the note from Louis
Bernard, and the one on which the address of Ambrose
Chappell is written and shoves them into his pocket.
He rises to meet his guests.
JAN
See.
We could have talked.

Ben volunteers his hand to Val Parnell, while nodding
at Mrs. Parnell.

pats her wide hips)
Cindy. It doesn't fit any more.
VAL
Where's your boy? I'd like to see
which one you he looks like.
All momentary gaiety goes from Jo's face, and Ben has
a hard time appearing nonchalant.

people -- so we can have a little time
to ourselves.

And I wish I could persuade her to
stay a month.
JO

comfortingly on the shoulder.
BEN

Aren't you going to wait for a drink,

BEN
Thank you, but I'll catch up when I

Ben starts for the door.

Ben opens the door, and Jo follows him half-way into
the corridor. The voices of the others are half-heard
over Jo and Ben's sotto voce conversation.

In the background, the four visitors, while not actually
eavesdropping, are somewhat subdued by the attitude of
the McKennas toward each other.
JO
Ben, for the last time, please let me
go.
He pats her affectionately on the cheek.
BEN
Two people are much
easier to follow

want Buchanan's
men on our tracks.
Or the other people,
either. I'm going
out by the service
entrance --
He turns and goes quickly. She watches him briefly,
then turns back into the room. She tries to assume a
more pleasant face...
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
Ben follows the workman into the shop. It is cluttered
with stuffed animals of every size and shape imaginable.
Lions, tigers, elephant heads, swordfish, crocodiles --
everything. Ben stares around at what he sees. A
number of workmen are busy mounting, stuffing, and
preparing animals for display. The workmen who let
him in calls to someone.
WORKMAN
A sent to see you, sir.
A man, about eighty years old, turns from inspecting a
piece of work, and comes forward to Ben. He is a thin,
gracious, gentle sort of creature.
CHAPPELL SR.
Good afternoon, Sir. I am Ambrose
Chappell.
Ben studies the man briefly. His face shows disbelief
that such a man could be put of an assassination plot.
Chappell stops in front of him, waits a brief moment.
CHAPPELL SR.
What can I do for you?
BEN
Well you see, I uh...
There is a twinkle in the old man's eye.

But I think I understand your problem.

CHAPPELL SR
Certainly. It happens all the time.
You expected someone else -- Just a
moment.
(He turns and calls
out)
Ambrose!
From behind a doorway on the
far side a man emerge s
in response to the call. He
is somewhat younger than
the first Ambrose Chappell,
but not by much. He is
the fifty-year-old gentleman
who had been apparently
following Ben on the street.
The CAMERA PANS him over
following to his father, and
Ben.
CHAPPELL SR.
I think this gentleman wants to talk
to us.
CHAPPELL JR.
Now, father. Now why don't you go and
have a nice rest?
CHAPPELL SR.
Humph!
I have centuries of rest ahead
of me.
(Nods to Ben)
Good day to you, sir.
Ben nods in return, and the elder Chappell returns to
whatever he was doing when Ben entered.
CHAPPELL JR.
Now what can I do for you?
Ben turns his attention back to the son.
He is now a
little more in command of himself.

BEN
I'm Doctor Mckenna.

reaction)
Does the name mean anything to you?
Chappell Jr. thinks for a moment.
The name obviously
doesn't register.
CHAPPELL
I don't think so.
A widor angle of the shop. Workmen pause in their
work to look in the direction of Ben with some
curiosity.
Chappell Jr. nods his head, but waits with a deadpan
expression for Ben to continue. After a pause, Ben
does.
BEN
You have no idea why I came here?
CHAPPELL JR.
My dear sir, I haven't the faintest
idea!
Ben's expression shows that he feels Chappell is putting
up a thorough bluff, but he still goes on.
BEN
I was given your name by someone I
happened to meet in Marrakesh.
Chappel Jr.'s expression doesn't change, except for a
slightly raised eyebrow.
CHAPPELL JR.
Oh, yes?
Ben now has the feeling he's on to the right man.
BEN
I suppose you've heard of him.
Louis
Bernard. A Frenchman.
CHAPPELL JR.

The workmen half-listening, return to their work on
the various animals. They are a bit self-conscious at
being observed eavesdropping.
Ben turns back to Chappell Jr. He moves in a little
closer, and drops his voice somewhat. Chappell Jr.
watches him warily.
BEN
Let's stop fencing with words, huh?
Bernard told me to come here, just
before he died.
CHAPPELL JR.
This man is...dead?
BEN
You know it as well as I do. Now I
came to make a business proposition.
And I don't see how you can turn it
down.
Ambrose Chappell looks over to a man stuffing animal's
corpse.
CHAPPEEL JR.
What did you have in mind?
BEN
You want to talk here?
CHAPPELL JR.
Certainly. We have no secrets from
our employees.
BEN
Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered
one word of what Bernard told to before
he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm
not interested in political intrigue,
and I don't care who it is you're going
to kill here in London. All I want is
that boy, and I'll get on the first
plane for America.
When Ben begins mentioning a killing, Chappell Jr's
face takes on a look of alarm, almost panic. He moves
back from Ben, watching him like a deadly cobra. Ben,
however, now convinced that he has the right man in
front of him, moves in on him to finish his proposition.
BEN
Now that isn't all.
If money will do

Chappell Jr. now seems thoroughly frightened. He moves
back from Ben, almost stumbling. He turns, goes back
to the door of a small office, in which is now standing
Chappell Sr.
Chappell Sr. leans closer to the open door, as the son
speaks urgently and sotto Voce to him.
CHAPPELL JR.
Father -- phone the police!
Quick!
Chappell Jr. now turns back toward Ben, trying to assume
a pleasant and casual manner.
CHAPPELL JR.
Now, sir -- shall we go into this a
little more carefully? You said
something about money?
Workmen are pausing in their work to look at the pair,
wondering at the mention of money.
BEN
You told him to call the police.
Now
don't try to bluff me like that!
He reaches out quickly, grabs Chappell jr. by the label.
The man gives an involuntary cry of fear.
Chappell Sr. is on the phone.
CHAPPELL SR.
This is Ambrose Chappell's -- Burdett
Street. Will you send someone round
at once?
(Glancing toward
him)
There's is an extraordinary individual
here, and we really can't cope with
him.
Chappell Jr. struggles to get loose from Ben's grasp.
CHAPPELL JR.

boy is?
CHAPPELL JR.
No, of course not! Edgar!
William!
Davis! Help!
Ben lets go of Chappell Jr., and turns in confusion.
The workmen drop their tools, and move in on Ben quickly
and threateningly. Even Chappell Sr. comes out of the
office in alarm. Ben backs away toward the door.
BEN
Now just a minute. Take it easy. I
obviously got the wrong place. Now
stay away from me.
But they don't. They come on. Ben looks quickly around
for a weapon, or an exit. He sees the door, and moves
quickly toward it, but the workmen are faster than he
is. Two of them bar the exit. Ben tries to shove
them out of the way and get through the door. The men
grapple with him. Chappell Jr., himself, and another
workman rush in, endeavoring to subdue Ben. A silent,
but furious struggle ensues. It is now a complete
melee between the four men and Ben as they try to hold
him down.
CHAPPELL JR.
Hold him...hold him...till the police
come.
Ben breaks loose temporarily, trying to find another
escape. He realizes that the time for talking is past.
But as fast as he is, the men are on him again. They
twist and struggle through the stuffed and mounted
animals. There is a melange of lion heads, swordfish,
and other partially completed jobs. Sometimes, Ben in
his struggles comes face to face with the angry head
of a bared-teeth lion. Ambrose Chappell Jr. himself
at one point finds the swordfish a very painful object
somewhere about his anatomy. Ben eventually wrenches
himself free.

Shooting toward the doorway. The confusion
gives him
a free moment. He makes the door, twists it
open, and
dashes out into the yard. Suddenly he turns
back and
dashes in again. The man retreat in fear.
Ben picks
up his fallen hat and dashes out again.
The five persons in the McKenna suits are sitting
around. All but Jo have drinks in their hands. She
seems to be absorbed in her own thoughts, but Val
Parnell is holding forth, oblivious at first to her
disinterest.
VAL
...and back at our flat, after the
first night, Chris had the nerve to
suggest that the sketch where Bud
Flanagan comes in dressed up as the
Countess was unconvincing ... that no
matter how well-got-up Bud Flanagan

Hartnell, nobody would believe he was
an aristocrat. So I said, 'Look Chris,

column out of the paper?! --
He stops talking, as he looks across at the silent Jo.
Helen and the others, follow his look. They watch her
sympathetically. Jo
seems totally unaware that anyone
else is in the room, staring, into thin air, absorbed
with thoughts of her own.

Slowly Jo's expression begins to chance to one of
interest. We see a flood of thoughts expressed in her
face. She looks across at Val and replies:
JO
No.
No...you mean Chappell!
She rises from her chair with some excitement.
She
murmurs, almost to herself:
JO
It's not a man, it's a place! Ambrose
Chapel! Ambrose Chapel! It has to
be!
The others watch Jo, puzzled at her strange performance.
No one dares speak until she finds out what it means.
With some excitement, Jo addresses Val Parnell.
J0
Do they list chapels in the London
Telephone Directory?
VAL
Let's a take a look.
He crosses to the telephone desk, picks up telephone
directory and opens it.
INSERT of telephone directory - Val's finger lands on
'Ambrose Chapel, 17 Ambrose Street, West Two.'
VAL
(Excitedly)
Here it is, Ambrose Chapel, 17 Ambrose
Street, West Two.
He turns triumphantly to Jo. Without hesitation she
crosses to a table, takes her purse. She hurries to
the door without a word; then turns to them.
JO
I'm very sorry.

But have another drink -- and please

She hurries out the door. The others are left standing,
looking at each other. Val and Helen speak almost at
the same time, asking each other the same question.
VAL AND HELEN
Explain what?
DISSOLVE:
The Parnell party are still wondering what all this is
about.
CINDY
There's something weird going on around
here that I can't follow.
VAL
Let's see if we can figure this out.
First of all there was a man named to
uh...
HELEN
Ambrose Chapel.
CINDY
And Ben rushed off to see him.

HELEN
Then Jo said it wasn't a man, but a
place and she dashed off.
JAN
Don't mention it again or I might dash
off.
CINDY
What a temptation.
HELEN
Can you fathom it, Val?
Val paces thoughtfully, and they watch him.
VAL
It must be a now American gag.
I'll
ask Danny about it.
At that moment the door suddenly opens. Everyone turns
in surprise. Ben is standing in the doorway. He comes
slowly into the room, closing the door. He is very
tired looking, and disheveled. They watch him enter
silently.
Too tired to say anything at first, Ben drops into the
first chair he comes to. Then he looks up.
BEN
Where's Jo?
Val walks over to him, hands him a ready-made drink.
Ben takes it but doesn't have time to drink when Val
speaks.
VAL
She's just gone off to Ambrose Chapel.
Immediately Ben puts down the drink.
BEN
But -- but, that's where I've been...
He stands up.
VAL
It isn't your Ambrose Chapel!
Ben looks at him questioningly.

BEN
Where is it!
What's the address?
Val crosses to find the phone book on the desk and
looks for address.
VAL
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.
Ben moves quickly to the door and goes out into corridor
as telephone rings. Jan answers it. She puts down
the receiver and shouts out to Ben.
JAN
Doctor! Doctor!
It's Jo!
Come back --

Ben comes quickly into the room pushing his way through
everyone.
He goes immediately to the phone.
Jan hands Ben the

BEN

Jo is overjoyed to hear Ben's voice.

(Interrupting
hurriedly)
I have the address, Jo. Now stay there
until I get there...and don't do
anything!
Jo loses some of her anxiety.
JO
I'll meet you outside.
She hangs up, sighs and starts out of the phone booth.
Ben hangs up the phone and starts for the door. He
looks back at the group as he pauses in doorway.
BEN
Will you stick around? We'll be back
as soon as we can. I don't know how
to thank you.
He goes out through the door closing it.
Everyone
stands staring at the door.
DISSOLVE TO:
A non-conformist Chapel. Empty, except for
one figure,
a woman laying out music on the organ rack
in the front
of the Chapel. The CAMERA MOVES IN on her,
and as she
turns on her way to the hymn board, we see
that she is
Mrs. Drayton. At the hymn board, she slips
into it a
series of hymn numbers.
The CAMERA THEN PANS her across the empty chapel to a
side door. She goes through it.
She comes up a flight of stairs, the CAMERA MOVING
with her. She stops at a door on the first landing,
takes a key out of her pocket, and unlocks the door.
She enters.
Inside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes
the door behind her and stands with her back to it,
watching. The CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY to reveal the rest
of the room. Sitting at a small table is a listless,
young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the
woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the
autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with
the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has
caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious
satisfaction jumps three of her men.
HANK
Three men! You don't know much about
checkers, do you?
MRS. DRAYTON
It's time you went to bed, dear.
You'll
get tired out.
HANK
Can I finish? I'm winning?
MRS. DRAYTON
Yes, you finish. Edna, see that he
gets some milk and biscuits.
EDNA
And he'd better have another sleeping
pill...I've got to get downstairs --

HANK
I guess so.
EDNA
Hurry up if you want to finish this
game.
MRS. DRAYTON
Look it doesn't hurt to be kind. Yell
out when you want me to open the door.
Edna studies the board with a frown.
Mrs. Drayton
smiles and goes out the door.
In the corridor once again Mrs. Drayton locks the door,
and crosses the hall. The CAMERA PANNING her. She
enters another door.
She enters a larger, more ornate room. The CAMERA
PANS her in, and we see first Drayton, who is putting
on a surplice -- and then the man who knocked on the
McKennas' door in the Mamounia Hotel, looking for
someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and
tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped
underneath his armpit; Mrs. Drayton, without a word,
sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with
something close to fatigue. Then she speaks.
MRS. DRAYTON
I wish it was tomorrow.
Drayton turns, having finished his dressing.
DRAYTON
(Coldly)
That's not a very orthodox sentiment.
He goes to a desk, and takes something out of a drawer.
It is a small envelope. He turns to the man with the
gun.
DRAYTON
Two excellent tickets for the concert
at the Albert Hall -- with my
compliments.
He hands them to Rien. Rien takes the envelope, glances
at it briefly, then puts it into his pocket.
DRAYTON
Your box is nicely placed, or shall we
say strategically placed.

He goes to a portable record player, which is open and
has a record on it. He looks down at the phonograph.
DRAYTON
Now for the most important part.
He gestured towards the record.
RIEN
What is it?
DRAYTON
A record of the delightful Picco they
will play tonight.
RIEN
What about it?
DRAYTON
Music is less in your line than
marksmanship. If you will listen, my
friend, I will play for you the exact
moment at which you can shoot. Now
listen carefully.
Drayton plays the record.
DRAYTON
Let me do it for you again.
Now listen
for the cymbal crash.
Drayton plays the record again and claps his hands
together at the cymbal crash.
DRAYTON
You see at such a moment your shot
will not be heard. The listeners will
not even be disturbed. I think the
composer would have appreciated that.
No one will know.
RIEN
None except one you mean.
The assassin smiles.
DRAYTON
Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend.
Any questions musical or otherwise?
RIEN
No.
DRAYTON
There's's one comforting thought. It
happens early in the evening. I hope
I won't upset you if I say there's
time for one shot only. If you need
another, the risk is yours.

RIEN
I do not take risks.
DRAYTON
That's a comfort -- traipsing all the
way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I
should like you to do me credit.
He looks at his watch.
DRAYTON
Your distinguished target's on the way
there now. A car is waiting for you
downstairs at the back entrance. You
will pick up a Miss Benson on your
way. She will be your companion in
the box. She's there to lend an air
of respectability...if that's possible.
RIEN
You will have the money when I return?
DRAYTON
I think you can trust me.
RIEN
(Looking him up and
down)
What is your English proverb -- a wolf
in Sheep's clothing?
Drayton laughs.
DRAYTON
I think you
had better be going. It
is impolite
to be late for a concert.
It would be
awkward if they made you
wait until
the first selection is over.
He turns to his wife.
DRAYTON
See him downstairs, my dear.
(To Rien)
I'm sorry you must sneak out the back
way, but we have to preserve our
respectable front.
She exits with the assassin.
Drayton turns to the
mirror and surveys himself.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
Coming up the aisle with a collection basket, collecting
money during the hymn is Mrs. Drayton. She is
approaching the row in which the McKennas are standing.
Jo looks towards Ben helplessly. Mrs. Drayton is
between the two of them and any possible exit. Ben
immediately eases his way along behind a column which
hides him somewhat from the front, but not from the
side. Jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall
woman in front of her, but she is not entirely
successful. We can see Mrs. Drayton getting closer to
them.
Jo looks toward Ben almost panicked. Suddenly Mrs.
Drayton has reached the end of their row. She pushes
forward her collection plate, and as she does so her
face blanches. She instantly identifies the two.
Ben, with little else to do, looks her straight in the
eye and puts some coins into her plate.

As the astonished Mrs. Drayton turns to go back down
the aisle with her plate of coins and bills, we now
see the surpliced Mr. Drayton ascending the pulpit.
He looks down to his wife.
From Mr. Drayton's viewpoint, as he notices his wife
coming up the aisle with a startled expression on her
face. She tries to
nod with her head to indicate
something important lies behind her.
Mr. Drayton, trying to puzzle out her alarm, studies
her face, and then lifts his eyes to look beyond her.
The expression on his face leaves no doubt that he
cannot understand what she's trying to convey. The
hymn has come an end, and the congregation starts
seating itself.
The McKennas take a seat along with the rest, and as
yet they are relatively inconspicuous from the front
of the chapel. Ben takes a piece of paper out of his
pocket, examines it, and satisfied it is the right
one, hands it to his wife. The congregation falls
silent as Drayton is apparently about to begin his
sermon.
Drayton glances down to his Bible, opens it a certain
page, and as he does so, he looks at his wife who is
sitting near the organ. She half-turns to look up at
him. She seems frightened. Drayton fumbles with the
pages of the Bible, apparently trying to make something
out of his wife's attitude. Failing, he looks up and
begins his sermon. He speaks into a microphone.
DRAYTON
Brothers and Sisters: The subject of
my address this evening is adversity.
The average life, yours and mine, is
often harassed and perplexed by
cruelties and disappointments beyond
our control.
Strangely enough, it is often the things beyond our
control which help to make us better beings.

Pain and tribulation are the testing ground of
life
and let us be grateful for them. Let us bless
the
disappointments and the frustrations and say a
prayer
for the agony of the moment. Only thus shall
we confirm
and re-confirm our own goodness and therefore
the
essential goodness of all Mankind.
Half-glancing at Drayton as he delivers his sermon.
Ben talks to Jo. Their conversation is whispered.
BEN
That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on
out and call him and ask him to surround
the place with police.
JO
What if he asks me...
BEN
Tell him...tell him everything. This
is the time. I'm sure Hank is around
here some place.
JO
Ben, I don't want to leave you.
BEN
I don't know how else to do it, honey.
Ben gives her a gentle push. With a regretful look at
him, she slides out of the seat.
In the middle of his sermon, Drayton looks up. He
almost falters and stops, as he sees Jo rise from her
seat.
The chapel as seen from Drayton's viewpoint. Jo has
turned up the aisle and gone out the door at the back.
Drayton composes his face, but his eyes are serious.
Without the slightest pause, he continues his sermon,
shifting his ideas in mid-paragraph.
DRAYTON
Few of us pause to think how life's
adversities work in our behalf, to
make better men and women of us.

DRAYTON (CONT'D)
But I believe we should pause now to
do a little stock-taking -- to look
into our own hearts and see what we
find there. Therefore instead of
continuing the service, I think we
should all return to our homes for
private meditation, remembering how
little we have to complain of and how
much to be grateful for. Next week I
shall discuss the fruits of our
meditation. Until then, my blessing
upon each and every one of you.
Ben watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart.
There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells
them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly.
Drayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from
the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The
members rise from their seats and begin filing out of
the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances
toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have
heard.
When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he
beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers
something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to
him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton
goes off through a side door by the altar, while the
organist makes her way down the aisle through the
congregation to stand by the door.
The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through
the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the
front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow
and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel,
Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets
him with bland amiability.
DRAYTON
Well this is a pleasant surprise,
Doctor.
BEN
Where's my boy, Drayton?

DRAYTON
He's upstairs. As a matter of fact
you've just come in time to help my
wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank
doesn't care much for English cooking.
Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he
talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows
it cautiously. But before he can confirm his
suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing
that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly.
At the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has
just closed the door, and is in the process of locking
the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts
the key and puts it into her pocket.
Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has
changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat
of his robes.
BEN
What do you want? I'll give you money
and keep my mouth shut. All I want is
my boy.
DRAYTON
And what about your wife? Did she go
outside just to get some fresh air.
BEN
Tell me what you want.
I'll do
anything.
DRAYTON
All right -- you'll see your boy in
good time.
With a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from
Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses
it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens
and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly
to face them, backing of a little.
One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and
the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves.
Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind
them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and
suddenly dashes for the steps.

He surprises them with his speed, and before anyone
can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the
microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon.
He yells into it.
BEN
Hank! Hank McKenna!
Hank!
Where are
you? Hank! Hank!
As the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash
for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly
off, the voice of Hank:
HANK
Daddy!
Daddy, I'm here!
Dad -
His voice is choked off. Ben jumps down from the pulpit
in an effort to make for the open door, but the two
men throw themselves on top of him.
Jo speaks into the phone with great urgency.
JO
...And Ben is in there now, watching
the both of them!
Woburn, assistant to Buchanan, is listening intently
on the phone. The office behind him is not handsomely
appointed. Jo's voice is heard on filter.
J0
He sent me out to call you -- so we
could do something before they get
away.
WOBURN
I see, Mrs. McKenna -- and you believe
your son is somewhere in the chapel?
JO
I don't know, I don't know where he
is...but at least these people will

send somebody to get them.

waiting for me to bring some help.

said when we needed him, to call.
Woburn is concerned.
WOBURN
I'm awfully sorry, but I simply can't
get hold of him just now. He's gone
to a rather important diplomatic affair --
at the Albert Hall.
Jo is tired of his talk.
She wants action.
JO
Well call him there, please!

As he talks, Woburn reaches for a pad d a pencil, and
begins making some notes.
WOBURN
He's on his way. I don't know quite --
JO

Then can't you do anything -- right
away -- before we lose the Draytons?
WOBURN
I assure you, I'll do all I cant as

Woburn finishes making his notes. He reaches for
another phone with his left hand, and dials a number
as he talks to Jo.
WOBURN
(Efficiently)
That won't be necessary. I'll see
that the chapel is put under immediate
observation. By the time you get back
a police car should be there. Please
return to your husband, tell him to
come straight out of the chapel, and
let the police take over.
He turns to the other phone.
WOBURN
Woburn, Special Branch, hold on.
(To the other phone)
I must ring off now, Mrs. McKenna.
Please believe me, I'll have everything
laid on.
With a feeling of frustration, Jo hangs up the phone
as Woburn clicks off on the other end. She exits to
the phone booth.
The chapel is deserted inside. In the dim light we
can see a form stretched out on the floor. It is Ben.
He begins to stir a little as if just beginning to
come to after being knocked unconscious.
There is a big staff of kitchen help, chefs, maids of
middle-age, all preparing food for what is obviously a
big party. The man who has entered, calls to them to
get their attention.
GUARD
Hello.
Hello.
The work falls quiet as they become aware of him.
GUARD
Everybody out into the corridor.
Hurry
(He claps his hands)
There is a moment of bewilderment and confusion. The
man crosses to someone obviously a butler, and whispers
some words to him. The butler turns to the workers
and starts herding them toward the corridor through a
door in the far corner of the kitchen.
BUTLER
Do what he says. Come on. It will
only be a minute. Come on, all of you --
out.
The man goes to the door.
The man moves back into the kitchen, and goes to stand
guard at the doorway through which the workers left.
The door is closed.

The servants are packed together at one side of the
corridor. They are talking, grumbling.
WOMAN COOK
This embassy -- there's always something
queer going on.
While the other servants are grumbling, one is saying
nothing. He rather a Shrewd-looking young footman.
He strains to listen through closed door. Coming from
the kitchen are several sounds. A door opening, the
walking of feet, and finally the slam of a door.
ANOTHER VOICE
Bringing people in, in secret...
ANOTHER VOICE
Give me the Swiss Embassy every time,
there's neutrality for you!
Then the sound of a car leaving outside. The door to
the kitchen opens and the servants, including the young
footman enter again.
The young footman, among the first to enter, surveys
the kitchen. There is no sign of anyone having passed
through.
Inside the chapel we can see the cause of the spasmodic
bell ringing. Ben is using
the rope to climb out of
the chapel. He succeeds in
reaching high window. He
holds on to the window, and looks down.

Ben decides to swing to the opposite window which will
be away from the street. He swings, grabs, and with
some difficulty manages a foothold. He finally climbs
out through the window.
Shooting down from the stone-stepped, cast-iron
railinged staircase we see the milling people going
off in different directions to their seats. There is
a hubbub of voices through which we can hear the
programme sellers crying out their wares.
Jo patiently awaits her turns as two or three people,
perhaps a couple of Chelsea 'long-hairs', and one other
people, who obviously have not reserved ahead of time
because they had no money, take their turns at the
window. A uniformed attendant, standing beside this
queue, is repeating information for the benefit of the
queue.
UNIFORMED ATTENDANT
Seats at a guinea. Starting Room three
and six --
Jo moves out of the queue and addresses him.
JO
(Rather urgently)
I would like to see the manager, please.

Jo turns away disconsolately and starts Jo seek these
men out for herself. The CAMERA PANS her over and she
finds herself blocked off by a crowd of four or five
feet deep.
Jo, standing on her toes endeavoring to look beyond
the block of people. Suddenly her face changes as she
sees:
Shooting over the head of crowd she sees the arrival
of an important personage. He is accompanied by others
who are apparently attendants upon him. A couple of
the individuals behind him are wearing large order
sashes underneath their white waistcoats. The principal
figure of this group is an oldish an around sixty. He
is in white tie and tails, and also wearing a number
of foreign orders. About third is line behind him
comes 'Buchanan'.
Jo immediately recognizes him.
From her viewpoint we see the men she has been seeking,
possibly the manager of the Albert Hall, his assistant
cow-towing behind him, and alongside of the manager
someone dressed like he might be 'Sir Kenneth Clarke',
the head of the Arts Council, The new-arrival is
greeted. There is an exchange of courtesies, after
which they are led on toward the beginning of the
staircase. As 'Buchanan' comes nearer.
Jo tries to push her way through towards him. The
people around her resent her efforts. Behind Jo are
two girls in their early twenties. Both are Chelsea
types.

Well, I'll guarantee he's got a better
seat than we have.
The CAMERA PANS Jo as she does manage to get forward a
little, but she is caught up in the Sudden break-up of
the people who have lined up to see arrival. By the
time she is in the clear the CAMERA PANS her further
and over her shoulder we see the last of 'Buchanan'
and the rest up the staircase, followed by other members
of the audience going up in the same direction.
We see Jo's frustration filling her face. She begins
to turn her head. She looks down with indecision.
In the foreground are passing people hurrying towards
their seats. There, taking a step forward and staring
in Jo's direction, is Rien, the Assassin. His face
shows considerable alarm at what he sees.
From his viewpoint Jo is
half-turned in his direction.
Her head is still down.
Slowly she looks up. Her
mouth half-opens when she
sees the man she once saw in
the corridor of the hotel
at Marrakesh.
Rien, with a quick thought, hurries over to her.
The two are in SEMI-CLOSEUP.
He says to her quietly:
RIEN
You have a very nice little boy, madame.
He turns to go.
Jo clutches him and almost cries out.

Where Is he?
Where is he?
Rien does not reply. The CAMERA PANS him away. We
see him join a woman escort and make their way for the
staircase.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we now see that the crowd in
the lobby is thinning out. Jo stands alone, jostled
by a stream of late arrivals. From the hall itself we
can hear the SOUND of the orchestra tuning up, followed
by a burst of applause, with a few shouts which
obviously herald the arrival of the visiting dignitary
in his box.
Jo stares toward the opening into the hall. She seems
drawn to go in. She crosses and the CAMERA FOLLOWS
her to the first entrance to the outer corridor.
Jo stands for a moment and then slowly crosses the
corridor to the main entrance where the ticket collector
and a programme girl stand. As she approaches the
opening, the ticket collector steps forward.
TICKET COLLECTOR
Your ticket, madam?
Jo shakes her heads.
JO
If you don't mind, I'm just looking
for someone.
She takes a step or two forward as some new arrivals
take up the attention of the ticket collector. The
programme girl escorts them out of the scene.
Jo stares at the vast hall in front of her.
From her viewpoint she sees the complete hall, the
orchestra and choir assembled, and a round of applause
is heard as the conductor is seen threading his way
toward the instruments and mounts the podium.
Jo steals a glance toward the box which first catches
her eye.

From her viewpoint she sees the
flag-draped box of the
foreign visitor. It is full of
his entourage and seat
slightly to the left of him in
the second row 'Buchanan'
is sitting. Nearer to her and
in front of 'Buchanan'
on one side of the dignitary is
a be-medalled, blue-
sashed individual who might be
an Ambassador.
Jo turns her head away and looks at the other side.
The CAMERA roves among the boxes. Suddenly it stops
on one as the Assassin takes his seat with his woman
escort like any ordinary couple. They are quite casual
in their behavior.
Jo becomes transfixed. A sudden silence returns her
attention to the orchestra.
From her viewpoint we see the full orchestra, the
conductor with raised baton.
The Women's choir raise their sheets of music in unison.
From a point high above we see the whole hall, the
audience, and the orchestra. The cantata starts with
a roll on the timpani and a burst of music.
A nearer view of the orchestra.
A whole sweep of the orchestra with the choir
predominant.

A skimming shot over the top of the orchestra with the
strings in the foreground predominant. The SOUND of
these instruments seems to dominate the other music
due to their proximity to the CAMERA.
The cellos -- again their sound dominates the scene.
The woodwinds -- the same sound effect.
Now the brass.
Their notes drown out the rest of the
orchestra.
Now the double brass. As each of these shots follow
in succession, we get more intimate with each group of
instruments and finally:
To the timpani where we just hear the kettle drums
booming away.
At last one individual, who is seated with legs crossed
and arms folded, on a chair, and beside him on another
chair, the cymbals.
The inert cymbals resting on their chair.
Rien in his box is glancing toward the orchestra. He
looks down beside him and slowly picks something up
from a chair.
Jo stares up and catches her breath.

From her viewpoint we see Rien is raising a pair of
small black leather opera glasses which he puts to his
eyes and studies his target.
Jo turns slowly and looks up at the dignitary's box.
He is turning to the man beside him, whom we shall
later know as the Ambassador, and indicates with
gestures how much he is enjoying the concert. He looks
back over his shoulder and gives the same gestures and
comments to 'Buchanan'. Then, turning forward, he
settles back comfortably in his seat to enjoy the music.
Through the doors we see a taxi pulling away and
presently a glass door opens and a dishevelled Ben
comes into the lobby. He comes up to the CAMERA and
looks about him.
From his viewpoint the lobby appears empty except
perhaps for a solitary uniformed policeman.
Ben look the other way and upstairs.
From his viewpoint the other direction -- just
emptiness.
We see Ben's bewilderment as to what to do and where
to go. We PAN him up to the first corridor entrance
that leads to the main circular corridor. Ben enters.
His face lights up.
From his viewpoint we see through the opening the ticket
collector and the program girl standing at the opening
leading down the main aisle. On the right, standing
with her back to him, is Jo.

The CAMERA PANS Ben as he hurries forward. He touches
Jo lightly on the shoulder. She turns, startled, and
manages to suppress an exclamation on seeing him. We
do not hear what they are saying but by their pantomime
we see that Jo is telling Ben all about the impending
shooting. Ben argues with her. He indicates he will
tell Buchanan. She frantically restrains him but he
shakes her off and dashes away.
We see Ben ascending the stairs originally taken by
the dignitary and his group.
Ben comes into the corridor and looks about him. Beyond
him we see a group of men obviously detectives, and
ahead of them a police constable. We see Ben hurry in
his direction.
Ben comes up to the constable and is about to pass him
when he is stopped. We again do not hear the dialogue,
but the pantomime shows that Ben is trying to get to
Buchanan. The constable doesn't quite know what to
make of Ben's dramatic plea. He indicates that he
must talk to his superior. Ben waits impatiently as
the constable goes over to one of the Inspectors who
is standing in a small group a little way off. From
his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the
Inspector with skeptical nods of his head in Ben's
direction.
Jo, looking over her shoulder and then up to the box
of the dignitary. She turns desperately towards the
direction of the Assassin's box.
Another view of the orchestra, but the duration of it
on the screen is much quicker.

A flash of the cellos.
A quick flash of the brass.
A timpani section.
The cymbals still laying on the chair.
The Inspector is turning to Ben, the Constable on one
side. Again in pantomime the Inspector questioning
the impatient Ben. He leaves Ben and goes over to the
men standing outside the door to the box. Ben half-
turns away with exasperation toward the CAMERA.
The conductor in the foreground.
We see a quick shot
of the orchestra beyond.
The singers.
The timpani.
We see a different angle the cymbals filling the screen.
CAMERA PULLS BACK quickly and the man who is to wield
them unfolds his arms and uncrosses his legs. He leans
forward to glance at his
score.
Ben is still waiting for the Inspector to discuss
matters with the plainclothesman. He turns and hurries
away, the CAMERA PANNING him.

Jo is almost weeping with the effect of the singing
and the emotional stress she is going through.
In the orchestra, the cymbal player now places one
hand on the cymbals on the chair.
In the box the Assassin places his hand for the
first
time inside his coat towards his holster. The
CAMERA
PULLS BACK to show the woman sitting with him,
seeing
this gesture, rising and backing away into the
dark
recesses of the box.
Ben is now quickly listening into the section behind
the boxes, one of which is occupied by the Assassin.
Ben looks along the corridor.
From his viewpoint we see rows of boxes.
Ben is a little nonplussed.
He approaches one.
The plainclothesmen and two uniformed policemen are
now coming toward CAMERA looking for the departed Ben.
Back in the orchestra the conductor is wielding his
baton vigorously. He swings over a sheet of music.
The choir turns over their music.

The cymbal player turns over his music. He looks at
the music in front of him and for the first time picks
up the cymbals.
A closer view of Ben shows him trying another door
cautiously and surreptitiously. He looks in and then
softly closes the door. He moves further along and
tries another door with the same cautious movement.
The Assassin now has his gun out in the darkness of
the rear of the box.
The cymbal player watching his music, his cymbals held.
From his viewpoint with the cymbals tipping the bottom
of the screen, we see all his music. It is blank.
The CAMERA SWIFTLY MOVES IN to the bottom of the right-
hand page showing the one note he is to strike.
Jo becoming more anxious and desperate. She looks up
towards the Assassin's box with horror as she sees:
The Assassin's figure moving forward and the tip of
the gun for the first time.

The cymbals are held in the foreground and through
them we can see the orchestra and the conductor beyond.
The conductor looks up from his score and points
deliberately to the cymbal player.
The cymbals clash together.
Jo leaping forward with a scream.
The dignitary is clutching his arm and slumping forward.
We gain an impression of those around leaping to their
feet.
The people around Jo, startled as they rise in their
seats and turn back to her.
Ben dashes to a final door and swinging it open finds
himself face-to-face with the Assassin. The latter's
hand goes for his holster. He pulls out his gun. Ben
lunges forward with a blow.
The Assassin staggers back and we hear the clatter of
the gun as it falls to the floor.

He immediately turns towards the CAMERA looking for a
means of escape. He leaps to the edge of the box to
go over into the next one. He slips.
We see the Assassin fall with a crash into the aisle
below him as Ben dashes forward in the box.
The soprano singers in the middle of their note quickly
change it to a unified scream.
The music trails off as the orchestra rises to its
feet at the startling occurrence.
The hall is in an uproar.
The people
around the dignitary in his box are backing
up to give
him air. Someone is examining his wound.
He see by
his movements and a shake of his head that
he is not
dead.
Jo is still standing looking up.
From her viewpoint she sees Ben leaning over the box
in horror looking down at the dead Assassin below.
The door opens and the uniformed and plainclothes police
dash into The box.
There is utter confusion in the lobby, police dashing
upstairs on either side.
We see Ben hurrying down the stairs. Jo rushes into
the lobby and, seeing Ben, dashes towards him.

A few of the people around the lobby begin to look at
Jo and Ben. We see the Assistant Manager hurry over
to them. They are in a group of three, and although
we do not actually hear what he says, due to the hubbub,
he is obviously questioning Ben and being solicitous
to Jo.
We go close just in time to catch the tail-end of the
conversation. Ben is just saying:
BEN
Then he didn't kill him?
ASSISTANT MANAGER
Your wife saved him -- it is only a
small flesh wound...Oh here he is
now...you must come and meet him...don't
be nervous...I'll get the aide to
present you...it will be all right
(To Woburn)
Would you present the lady to the prime
minister?
Suddenly their attention is drawn to something off-
screen up the stairs. The hubbub increases.
From their viewpoint we see the Prime Minister,
obviously not wounded sufficiently to incapacitate,
being escorted down the stairs by his Aide and other
members of the staff, including Woburn of the Special
Branch. The Prime Minister is indicating his arm and
obviously by the way he waves his hands, is deprecating
their concern about his wound. In fact he is rather
over-doing it. Just beyond them at the top of the
stairs we see 'Buchanan' standing with the Ambassador.
'Buchanan' is reassuring the Ambassador.
BUCHANAN
I'll report to you fully at the Embassy,
Your Excellency. In the meantime...
The manager is leading Ben and Jo across to the foot
of the stairs. They are reluctant but he insists. As
the CAMERA PANS them over they meet the group at the
bottom at the stairs. The manager calls out to Mr.
Woburn and indicates Ben and Jo.

Woburn is a little non-plussed.
He leans over to one
of the Prime Minister's Aides.
The latter's face lights
up. He leans over and whispers
something to the Prime
Minister. The Prime Minister is
all smiles.
Woburn steps down and introduces Ben and Jo to the
Prime Minister's Aide.
WOBURN
Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady
who --
The Prime Minister interrupts enthusiastically.
PRIME MINISTER
My dear lady, I shall be for ever in
your debt.
WOBURN
And this is her husband --
The Prime Minister interrupts again, less
enthusiastically.
PRIME MINISTER
A pleasure, my dear sir...
(He turns to Jo)
I trust you will permit me to wait
upon you tomorrow and to express the
depth of my gratitude.
JO
(Weakly)
It wasn't -- it wasn't --
PRIME MINISTER
(Gallantly)
Oh but it was, my dear lady.
There is an awkward pause.
The Prime Minister collects
himself and turns to move on out of the hall, the police
making a passageway for him through the crowd. We see
the Ambassador hurrying into the picture and moving
across the screen quickly to follow the Prime Minister.
Ben and Jo stand for a moment not knowing what to do
or where to go next. Woburn standing with Ben and Jo.
They look up and see Buchanan.

WOBURN
I think Mr. Buchanan would like to
talk to you.
From their viewpoint a grim 'Buchanan' is standing at
the top of the stairs.
The CAMERA PANS Ben and Jo up the stairs towards
'Buchanan'. They increase their pace towards him.
When they reach him they have only one thought in their
minds to ask him.
JO
(Wildly)
Where's our boy?
Where's Hank?
BUCHANAN
(quietly)
We can talk if you'll come in here.
The CAMERA PANS the three across the top landing and
to the doors of the 'Green Room' There are various
police standing about and some of Special Branch men
can be seen inside the room. 'Buchanan' steps aside
too allow Jo to enter. Then he and Ben follow her in.
The door closes behind them.
The three of them enter the 'Green Room', generally
used by the principal Artistes appearing at Royal Albert
Hall. Buchanan nods to two Special Branch men who are
standing about in case they are needed. The room is
informal containing arm chairs, a sofa and a number of
small tables. Jo sits down wearily into the nearest
chair. Ben remains standing, Buchanan takes a seat in
a chair near a telephone, he looks up at Ben as if he
expects him to say something. Ben responds to the
look.
BUCHANAN
(Coldly)
So you both know the time and place
all along.
BEN
(Roughly)
Don't be a fool.

BUCHANAN
An odd coincidence -- both of you
turning up here.
BEN
(Coldly)
Too bad you didn't contact your
assistant. He sent us both here.
BUCHANAN
(Quickly)
I beg your pardon.
BEN
You see, we finally needed that help
you offered. We still need it.
JO
(Urgently)
Yes, Mr. Buchanan.
We still need it.
The door opens and another member of the Special Branch
enters.
DETECTIVE
Sir?
Buchanan nods to him to speak.
DETECTIVE
We've questioned the woman. Said she
bought a ticket that happened to place
her in the same box with the man that
did the shooting. Doesn't know anything --
but if she does, she's not talking.
BUCHANAN
I'll see her later.
DETECTIVE
Very good, sir.
The Detective exits as Ben sits down dejectedly in a
chair.
BUCHANAN
(Gently)
Please tell me everything, now.
Everything.
(go turns to Jo)
There's still plenty of room for hope,
Mrs. McKenna...
A high CAMERA shows us a large hallway and ornate
ballroom.

As yet the room is about quarter filled and various
guests of the Diplomatic Corps and others are gradually
adding to the group. The CAMERA DOLLIES DOWN over
them until it reaches slightly open doorway. Peering
cautiously through we see the face of Drayton.
On the other side of the doorway is Drayton and his
wife. She is pacing nervously behind him. A footman
comes up to them and announces:
FOOTMAN
His Excellency will see you now.
Drayton motions to his wife and the CAMERA PANS them
after the footman across a small hallway. He is the
very same footman we saw among the group of servants
who were herded out of the kitchen. He opens a door
in front of the Draytons -- they enter.
Standing in front of a fireplace, above which is an
oil painting of the Prime Minister, is the Ambassador
whom we saw at the Albert Hall. He is on the telephone.
AMBASSADOR
Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman
won't talk, she won't talk and that's
that, I suppose. All right.
Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind the two as Drayton
advances towards the Ambassador with an easy manner,
the CAMERA PANNING him.
DRAYTON
(Easily)
Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain
to you -- something very unusual has
happened. I must also have the money
to pay our French marksman.
AMBASSADOR
(Almost casually)
Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering
that he's dead?
Drayton and his wife stare mutely at the Ambassador.
They are staggered at this news.

AMBASSADOR
His aim wasn't quite as good as you
led me to expect. The target merely
received a slight flesh wound in the
arm. Worse than useless.
Drayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador.
AMBASSADOR
Then your French friend panicked, and
made a fatal crash -- landing on the
floor of the Albert Hall.
DRAYTON
(Blustering weakly)
I don't see how you can hold me
responsible. He was most warmly
recommended by our people in
Marrakesh...
The Ambassador now begins to get really nasty.
AMBASSADOR
I'm glad you're able to treat the matter
so lightly. I am holding a reception
here this evening. In a few minutes,
I have to welcome our Prime Minister
as my guest of honor -- when I hope
and expected that he would be totally
unable to attend. That amuses you, no
doubt?
DRAYTON
(Feebly)
I don't know what to say ...
AMBASSADOR
(Brutally)
No. But I do. You've muddled
everything from the start. Kidnapping
that child in Marrakesh...Don't you
realize that Americans dislike having
their children kidnapped?
DRAYTON
(Trying to keep his
end up)
How else could I make sure the American
would hold his tongue?
AMBASSADOR
(Ignoring this)
And then, to crown it all, you get
cold feet and come running along here
to hide -- and bring the child with
you: Don't you see what you've done to
the diplomatic status of this Embassy?

How are you going to get the child out
of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?
DRAYTON
(Struggling for
self-confidence)
There's no difficulty about that,
surely? The car --
AMBASSADOR
(Interrupting)
With plain-clothes detectives planted
right round this building?
(Wryly)
You English intellectuals will be the
death of us all.
DRAYTON
(Desperate)
I'll think of some method.
Just give
me time....
AMBASSADOR
(He snorts
Contemptuously)
Time!
The Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage,
and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking
about something.
AMBASSADOR
I want the child removed from this
Embassy, and removed in such a way
that he won't be able to say any more
where he has been tonight.
MRS. DRAYTON
Oh, no!
The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a
manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say
something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth.
Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible
servility.
DRAYTON
Right, I'll see to it..
Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There
is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up.

BUTLER
Your Excellency, the Princess should

The Ambassador braces himself, his
chest swells out a
little, h assumes a set smile and
strides from the
room. Just at this moment we hear
a String Orchestra
in the distance strike up some gay
waltz music. The
Ambassador goes out of the door.
Mrs. Drayton is
looking down at the floor.
Ben is talking.
Buchanan is listening carefully.
BEN
...recognized him, and he recognized
me. So he jumped for it. And that is
all.
BUCHANAN

Trying to liquidate one of their own
big-shots. I wish they'd stick to
their usual custom, and do it in their
own country...
At this moment the phone rings. Woburn, who is now re-
placing the two Special Branch men in the room, picks
up the telephone.
WOBURN
Hello.

moment)
Hold on.
He turns the telephone over to Buchanan.
BUCHANAN

BEN
If the Draytons are at the Embassy,
Hank has to be there too!
Buchanan turns his attention back to Ben.
BUCHANAN
(Grimly)
You're probably right.
But we can do
nothing.
BEN
Why can't you?
BUCHANAN
Every Embassy in a foreign country has
extra-territorial rights.
BEN
What does that mean in common language?
BUCHANAN
As far as we're concerned, this Embassy
stands on foreign soil.
BEN
Does that mean they can steal children
and get away with it?
BUCHANAN
We could have the Foreign Office serve
a writ on the Ambassador.
He breaks off and speaks apologetically as If it were

answering and then Woburn speaks first.
WONBURN

Without answering Jo, Ben picks up the 'phone.
BEN

Ben looks at the group briefly.
Buchanan looks at Ben
with keen curiosity.
BEN
I'm going to speak to the Minister
himself.
Buchanan looks intrigued and surprised. We hear the
answering click on the other end of the phone.
BEN
May I speak to the Prime Minister,
please?
There is a pause and the distorted sound of a voice
mumbling on the other end of the phone. Ben interrupts
the question.
BEN
Tell him the lady who saved his life
wants to speak to him. Its important.
The voice on the other end of the phone mumbles briefly,
and there is silent. Ben has a satisfied look on his
face, as he hands the receiver to Jo. She seems
frightened.
JO
What am I supposed to say, Ben? I
don't know --

In the Ambassador's study underneath the oil painting
of himself, the Prime Minister is escorted to a
telephone by the butler who hands him the instrument.
Having been told who was on the other and of the line
he is all smiles as he greets Jo.
PRIME MINISTER
My dear lady...This is a charming
surprise...
He listens to the other end of the phone, agreeably
making sounds such as "ah ha" "ah" "hum", then he
speaks, with a gracious sweep of his hand and a half
bow to the telephone.
PRIME MINISTER
Delighted, delighted, delighted. The
Ambassador, too, will be delighted.
Any friends of mine are friends of
his. We will drink a little toast to
your country and to mine. Peacefully
we will co-exist...Yes?
He looks up to admire the painting of himself on the
wall.
Jo hangs up the phone, a little surprised and still
considerably nervous.
JO
(To Ben)
He said -- all right.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
They enter a large hallway. The liveried man closes
the door. Standing in a nearby doorway is a group of
people listening to the music of a string quartet
playing in the room beyond. Included in the group is
the Personal Aide of the Prime Minister. He sees Jo
and Ben enter, hurries over to them, smiling and eager.
The piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid
a round of polite applause. There are people rising
from their chairs and a general movement out into the
hallway.
AIDE
Good even. Would you come this way,
please? The Prime Minister is waiting
for you.
Following the Aide, Ben and Jo squeeze through the
crowded doorway.
The Aide leads Ben and Jo through the main room, the
CAMERA DOLLIES them. As they move through the room
people begin to notice them, first of all because they
are not dressed for the occasion -- but then the looks
seem to be admiring ones, and there is a smattering of
applause at their passage. Apparently people recognize
them. The Aide takes them to the Prime Minister, who
is just getting up from his seat of honor in the first
row.
The Prime Minister recognizes them immediately, and
comes forward quickly to meet them.

Discreetly, Ben moves away from the group, and over
toward a side wall, the CAMERA PANNING HIM. All eyes
are on Jo.
Jo adjusts herself at the piano. Her face seems
serious. She looks up briefly with her eyes to check
where Ben is.
The people in the hallway, realizing there is to be
more entertainment, move toward the main room.
A tries out the keys of the Piano.
People are finding their seats. There is coughing,
shuffling of feet, and then a gradual hush.
Ben watches Jo, and at the same time seems to be lookIng
around the room, particularly toward the various exits.
Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays
the introduction to her song. We see the great
tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional
smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but
always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice
seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole
room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place
that she has become so professional in such an intimate
drawing room setting.
Everyone in the ballroom is listening intently, and
with surprise, at her singing.

Jo's voice fading.
A door at the end of the corridor. We now hear the
song floating up clearly, but much diminished.
In a room on the other side of the door, Hank McKenna

Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his
feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to
open it.

Hank, a little mystified, has no answer. He walks
slowly back into the room, towards Mrs. Drayton,
listening and thinking about what he hears.
Mrs. Drayton's face shows a new and dangerous thought
coming into it. She looks down at Hank.
MRS. DRAYTON
Hank? -- can you whistle that song?
He looks at her and nods abstractedly.
HANK
I guess so.
She kneels down quickly to him.
MRS DRAYTON
Then go on -- whistle it.

as loud as you can.
On Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can
barely believe what she means. Then he understands.
He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to
whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously.
Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as
she watches him.
Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as
she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a
moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears
it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough
for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for
the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom
to find Ben, and her eyes go up.

Watching her, Ben understands.
He gives her the
slightest sign of agreement.
Jo continues her song with almost excitement in her
singing voice. The CAMERA passes around her as it
follows Ben as he walks along the wall slowly.
Ben makes his way along the wall toward the far doorway,
which leads to the grand staircase Everyone is so intent
on listening to Jo, that his movement attracts no
attention.
At the bottom of the service stairs in the back of the
Embassy, Drayton is standing with two men who came
with him in the car. One of them holds a short length
of rope in his hand.
DRAYTON
You two wait in the mail room.
I'll
bring him down.
Ben mounts two stairs leading up to the grand staircase.
He looks about him cautiously.
At the service stairs, Drayton goes up two stairs and
turns back to the men. He looks at his watch.
DRAYTON
I won't be a minute.
He starts to move up one step.
Up in the room, Hank is bent in a chair, sobbing, Mrs.
Drayton is kneeling by him, trying to reassure him.
She stops suddenly as she hears footsteps in the
distance. She rises to her feet, and as the footsteps
grow and grow, she looks at the boy desperately, She
goes to the door, hears the steps coming nearer and
nearer. She looks across at the window.

The barred window.
She looks down at Hank almost protectively, as
the
footsteps get still nearer. She goes to Hank,
kneels
down again and clutches the boy to her as the
footsteps
stop outside the door. She looks at the door,
with
horror.
The door handle turns quietly, but firmly.
Mrs. Drayton lets out a piercing scream. Hank's head
jerks up. The door is heard bursting open.
Ban stands in the doorway. He instantly rushes toward
Hank, the CAMERA PANNING him. Hank leaps to his feet,
and the two of them come together. No clear words are
spoken, Just muffled sounds of words as they hug each
other. Then they release each other, and turn to look
at Mrs. Drayton. She is standing, staring at the door
with horror. Ben turns quickly to look.
Framed in the doorway is Drayton. Deftly he reaches
into his pocket and produces a small automatic.
For a moment the group stands there in silence.
Then
Ben speaks.
BEN
I don't think you want to start any
shooting, Drayton -- with all those
people downstairs, and police outside.
Drayton looks at him without saying anything, but the
gun doesn't lower.
Mrs. Drayton addresses her husband fiercely.
MRS. DRAYTON
You've got to let the boy go!

DRAYTON
Precisely my own notion, my dear.
He moves forward on
the group, gun poised. Hank
clutches his father
in fright, and Ben tenses himself,
prepared for battle
if necessary. Mrs. Drayton stares
at her husband with
some defiance. Drayton addresses
Ben amiably.
DRAYTON
I'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help
me out of here?
BEN
Don't ask me for help, you miserable....
Drayton seems unperturbed by Ben's refusal. He leans
down closer to the boy, and addresses him directly.
DRAYTON
You wouldn't want your father to get
hurt, would you?
Hank looks up towards his father.
Drayton looks up.
Drayton's intentions are unmistakable. Ben looks down
at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode,
but he has sense enough to understand Drayton's meaning.
Drayton straightens up, a slight smile on his face.
He slips the gun into his pocket, but still holds it.
DRAYTON
We'll go down the stairs
together in a
casual sort of way. Then
we'll stroll
along to the nearest taxi
rank. I
trust there won't be any
emotional
outbursts...
BEN
(Interrupting)
There won't be. Hank -- don't say or
do anything.
Hank just nods.
He's too frightened to talk.
DRAYTON
Shall we go?
Ben starts for the door with Hank, and Drayton moves
into the other side of Hank. As they go through the
door, Mrs. Drayton makes an instinctive step forward,
if to attack Drayton from the rear, but the sight of
Hank in danger stops her.

The trio, Hank in the center, slowly strolls down the
corridor toward the main stairway. The sound of Jo
Conway's voice can be heard from below.
SHOOTING FROM BELOW we see the big staircase empty for
a moment, then the three appear at the top.
A closer view shows the terrified, tear-stained face
of Hank, and the tense features of Ben. Drayton seems
carefully alert. The CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD in front
of them as they descend. The music coming from the
ballroom ceases, as Jo finishes her second song. There
is the sound of great applause. The three are about a
dozen steps from the bottom, when suddenly Ben shoots
out a hard and pushes Drayton forward. Taken by
surprise, he stumbles, and falls down the stairs
clumsily. Clutching for support with his hands, the
gun goes off in his pocket, and he remains in a crumpled
heap at the bottom of the stairs.
The applause having died out, the shot is heard loud,
and people pour out of the ballroom into the hallway.
They rush for the stairway, and Drayton's body, led by
the Ambassador and the Prime Minister.
As people crowd excitedly around the body, Ben is
hurrying Hank away from the scene, the CAMERA PANS
them.
Mrs. Drayton stops half-way down the stairway, and
looks down in shook at the sight of her dead husband.
Inside the ballroom, which is emptying due to the rush
of people to the corridor, Jo has risen from the piano
and is almost afraid to go out and see what has
happened. In a moment, Ben and the boy appear in
the
doorway. Hank rushes across the ballroom to his
mother,
who moves quickly when she sees him.

HANK
Mummy.
JO
Hank.
They embrace.
QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:
Inside the McKenna's hotel room, the Parnells and the
two woman guests are sprawled out in ungainly attitudes
of sleep. Val is snoring pleasantly. The door of the
room opens and the three McKennas appear. The sound
awakes Val. He peers at them sleepily and struggles
to a sitting position. Ben closes the door.
BEN
I'm sorry we were gone so long, Val,
but we had to go and pick up Hank.
Ben's voice awakens the other women. They sit up, and
stare with bewilderment at the smiling trio of Ben, Jo
and Hank.
