A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent
LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The
sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop
for their arrival.
We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from
the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier.
Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three
pound truncheon.
BUCKY'S POV:
Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by-
fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans.
Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and
hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen
to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against
the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters.
Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls
quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos.
Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING--
away from the action...
down a side street and onto a
QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK.
He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a
voice:
VOICE
Bleichert! Bleichert!
A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE
ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway.
The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by-
fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet,
dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is.
VOICE OVER
I already knew him by reputation, had our
respective records down pat: Lee
Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight,
formerly a regular attraction at the
Hollywood Legion Stadium.
The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard,
trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the
marines' blows with his own truncheon.
LEE BLANCHARD
Code three, Bleichert!
Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in,
fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.
VOICE OVER
And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light-
heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring
magazine in 1937 fighting no-name
opponents in no-man's-land division.
On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the
marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft
midsections.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
In our first year at Central we'd never
spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions
about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard
fight, and who would win.
And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows
to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into
a heap.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by
early KO; Bleichert by decision;
Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but
Bleichert by knockout.
The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his
attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads
him away. He motions for Bucky to follow.
Lee turns back to the marines:
LEE
To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.
One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest
as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing.
The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be
heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night.
LEE (cont'd)
(re the Zooter)
Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos
Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive
warrant for manslaughter committed during
the commission of a Class B Felony.
Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she
keeled of a heart attack.
BUCKY
You come all the way down here to roust--
LEE
(smiling)
I came all the way down here same as you
did.
(jerks a finger to the riots)
Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see
those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--
(nudging Dos Santos)
Habla Ingles, Tomas?
The man shakes his head "no".
LEE (cont'd)
He's dead meat. Manslaughter Two's a gas
chamber jolt for spics. Hepcat here's
about six weeks away from the Big Adios.
Been better off getting a couple cracked
ribs from our Privates First Class back
there.
Blanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front
porch.
LEE (cont'd)
We'll never get him booked tonight.
CUT TO:
LEE JIMMYING THE FRONT DOOR...
An extremely bored Bucky Bleichert gives a man a speeding
ticket and sends him on his way.
Bucky drives as a ROOKIE COP chatters in the seat next to
him.
ROOKIE
Yep, three years in the Canal Zone.
Nothin' but skeeter bites and drunk
fights over three-dollar skank tail...
Bucky exits and sees Lee leaning against an unmarked car
talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut.
Lee waves Bucky over.
LEE
Bucky I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.
BUCKY
Hello.
FAY
I saw you fight a couple times. You won.
BUCKY
I always won. You a fight fan?
KAY
Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme
art classes so I'd sketch the boxers.
Lee puts his arm around her.
LEE
Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't
want me doin' the "vegetable shuffle."
He staggers around like a punch-drunk fighter.
BUCKY
I'll try not to hurt you.
A flicker of anger in her eyes.
LEE
Sure make Loew happy.
BUCKY
He's got money on me, I gather?
LEE
Seems that way.
BUCKY
And if I win I get Warrants?
LEE
Seems that way.
Bucky shakes his head. Turns to Kay.
BUCKY
What do you think of all this, Miss Lake?
KAY
For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets
ridiculed for perpetrating this farce.
For financial reasons I hope Lee wins.
And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both
look good with your shirts off.
Bucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand.
Lee takes it.
BUCKY
Luck short of winning.
LEE
You, too.
Bucky tips his hat to Kay and turns to go.
KAY
Luck, Dwight.
He stops at hearing his real name. But he knows she's waiting
to see his reaction so he keeps walking...
BUCKY'S BOXING MONTAGE
--Bucky hits the heavy bag in the police gym while Lee spars
in the background
VOICE OVER
The 77th Street lieutenant tapped as
official LAPD bookmaker had Lee as an
early 3 to 1 favorite...
--Bucky runs through Elysian Park with two pound weights on
his ankles.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
...while the real bookie line had Mr.
Fire favored by knockout at 2 1/2 to 1,
and decision by 5 to 3.
--Bucky spars with a fighter, peppering him with jab after
jab.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
Even the dicks in Ad Vice had suspended
bookie shakedowns because Mickey Cohen
was raking ten grand a day and kickin'
back five percent to the advertising
agency promoting the bond issue.
--Cops exchange betting markers during roll call...
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
I was a local celebrity again.
Bucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired
neighborhood. He exits the car carrying a cardboard box full
of canned goods and old girlie magazines.
ON THE PORCH OF THE HOUSE
a bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at
some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard.
ON BUCKY'S FACE
disgust and sadness.
This is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches,
pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even
worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow
rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy
shirt.
BUCKY
Papa?
DOLPH
Guten tag, Dwight.
BUCKY
Speak English, papa.
DOLPH
Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser!
He aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty.
Bucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the
dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood
airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen,
nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans...
BACK ON THE PORCH
Dolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns.
BUCKY
Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me
how you can fuck this place up so bad in
one month.
DOLPH
Du, Dwight? Du?
BUCKY
Speak...English. Papa, please.
He searches his father's eyes for a response and gets none.
He surveys the house again. Somewhere in the corner of his
eye we see the glint of an idea...
INSIDE THE HOUSE
Bucky on the phone.
BUCKY
...He's had another stroke. If you could
just come by and clean the place up and
keep an eye on him for week or so...a
hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten
days. I promise. I do. Thank you.
Bucky watches from across the street as AN OFF-DUTY NURSE
tries to get Papa Bleichert to eat a sandwich.
VOICE OVER
The old fuck never knew any better. Never
knew what he cost me. Or Sammy, who'd
died at Manzanar. I was a good fit in the
snitch's jacket and with a little
alteration I slipped easily into the
whole suit.
Pete Lukins waits outside on the porch for Bucky.
PETE
Well?
BUCKY
He'll catch on soon enough.
The scene widens behind the two men and we see the sign on
the facility:
KING DAVID VILLA
Jewish stars adorn the sign.
Lee Blanchard, his own bruises fading, stands in the yard.
LEE
You gonna hide in there another week?
Ain't you bored yet?
BUCKY
Gettin' there.
LEE
Wanna work Warrants with me?
BUCKY
What?
LEE
Harrell's been callin' to tell you. You
been hibernating--
BUCKY
But I lost. Loew's deal--
LEE
Don't you read the papers? The bond issue
passed yesterday. Want the job, partner?
Off Lee's devilish grin:
VOICE OVER
Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and the
snitch.
CUT TO:
Lee and Bucky pull up and look for a parking spot just as
MAYNARD COLEMAN trots down the front stairs and gets into a
car.
BUCKY
Right there!
They ease the car back into traffic and follow Coleman's car
from a safe distance. Bucky picks up the two-way radio. Lee
gestures for him to put it back:
Coleman's pulling into the parking lot of THE POLAR PALACE,
an ICE SKATING RINK. They follow.
Coleman exits his car, eyeing a group of kids carrying ice
skates and heading into the Polar Palace. He follows them
inside...
The two men follow...
INSIDE THE POLAR PALACE
Children skate around on the ice with a giant polar bear
suit. Lee and Bucky scan the area--not an adult in sight. Lee
spots some stairs leading to the restrooms and gestures to
Bucky, who hustles down them.
ON THE STAIRCASE
Maynard Coleman, carrying a stuffed bunny rabbit, walks up
the stairs toward Bucky. Just as the two men pass Bucky PULLS
HIS GUN and puts it to Coleman's head.
BUCKY
Police officer. You're under arrest.
Coleman throws his hands in the air; the bunny drops to the
ground. Bucky cuffs Coleman and leads him up the stairs as
Lee comes down from above.
A small voice from below Bucky:
VOICE OVER
Let go of him! Let go of him!
Bucky looks down to see A SMALL BOY pounding on his leg. The
kid's hysterical.
BOY
Let go a my daddy! Daddy!
The resemblance is unmistakable. Two generations of Okie
white trash. Bucky continues marching Coleman the elder up
the stairs as Lee snags the kid, both the father and the son
crying like babies.
Lee leads Bucky up the walk. Bucky's impressed with the house.
LEE
Don't say anything to Kay about DeWitt.
It'll upset her.
A montage of shots as Lee and Bucky cruise south on Crenshaw
Boulevard. The beginning of the post-war boom.
VOICE OVER
From November through the New Year, Lee
and I captured a total of eleven hard
felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and
three parole and probation absconders...
On Crenshaw's northern end, once grand and now dilapidated
houses in the process of demolition, their faces replaced by
giant billboards advertising department stores, jumbo
shopping centers and movie theaters.
VOICE OVER
After tours of duty, Lee and I would go
to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she
made dinner for us, other times the three
of us would go dancing, or see a flick.
Southbound, older wooden structures looking more and more
unkempt. Empty lots...
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
Always she'd be there, never in between
us, but always in the middle. It was the
best time of my life.
Lee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the
car--
LEE
This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm
callin' in some favors.
He heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it.
BACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER
Lee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating.
LEE
Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he's
shacking with some poon in a crib near
Slauson and Hoover.
BUCKY
It's all colored down there--
LEE
We fuckin' roll.
He pulls out.
CUT TO:
Lee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner.
Three are black and one is white.
LEE
Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address
or a name.
As Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start
the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white
guy glances at Lee:
WHITE HOPHEAD
What the---Blanchard?
LEE
Shut up, shitbird.
Lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him.
Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some
marijuana cigarettes.
Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man
closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt--
BUCKY
Partner!
Bucky pulls his .38...
THE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the
face--
THE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in
the neck--
ANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for
something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES.
LEE
Bucky duck!
Bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and
the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots
cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer.
Bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood-
covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter.
FROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS.
Bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket.
Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside
out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from
the blood.
All the while Lee cries like a baby.
Lee and Bucky walk up the front steps where they're met by
Kay. She runs to Lee and embraces him.
KAY
Oh baby. Oh babe.
She escorts him into the house. Bucky sees a newspaper on the
front porch railing. The evening edition of The Mirror.
"Boxer Cops in Gun Battle. Four Crooks Dead."
Publicity boxing photos accompany a full-page article. Bucky
begins to read it when he hears from inside:
LEE
Leave me alone! You'll never fucking
understand--
A door slam. Soon after the sound of Lee's motorcycle roaring
off... After a beat Kay comes outside and sits down next to
Bucky.
BUCKY
He knew one of the guys.
She nods.
BUCKY (cont'd)
It was them or us.
She nods again.
BUCKY (cont'd)
Tomorrow's off-duty so treat him nice--
KAY
Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight.
We're on edge. He swore at the trial he
was going to kill Lee.
BUCKY
We can take care of Bobby DeWitt.
KAY
Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby.
BUCKY
I know as much as I need to know.
Kay gives him a look: that's what you think. She gets up and
goes inside. Not knowing what to do, Bucky continues reading
the paper.
Bucky and Lee pull up to a mangy apartment building.
Photo men have already begun fanning out and taking photos.
Bucky sees Harry Sears take a shot from a hip flask in full
view of other officers. Lee and Bucky elbow their way to the
front and see:
The nude, mutilated body of a young woman, cut in half at the
waist. Another wide cut down her center reveal an empty
cavity--her organs have been removed.
Her face has been bashed in and her mouth cut ear to ear in a
leering smile.
Even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene. They
point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief
and disorder when
RUSS MILLARD
whistles harshly with his fingers in his mouth.
RUSS MILLARD
Before this gets out of hand let's put
the kibosh on something. If this gets a
lot of publicity we're going to get a lot
of confessions. So we keep some things
quiet. This girl was disemboweled. You
keep this information to yourselves. Not
your wives, not your girlfriends, no
other officers.
The men all nod, coming together as Millard takes control.
RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
No reporters view the body. You photo
men, take your pictures now. Coroner's
men, you put a sheet on the body as soon
as they're done. Set up a perimeter six
feet back. Any reporter crosses it,
arrest him.
(noticing Bucky)
Bleichert. What are you doing here?
Where's Blanchard?
Bucky indicates Lee, crouched down by the body taking notes.
BUCKY
Nash is renting a room in that building
over there.
RUSS MILLARD
Blood on the premises?
BUCKY
No. This isn't him.
RUSS MILLARD
The lab'll be the judge of that.
Millard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging
onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and
photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming
up against a line of cops keeping them from the body.
Bucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at
the body.
BUCKY
Hey. Junior Nash, remember?
LEE
He didn't do this.
BUCKY
No. He beat an old woman to death. That's
why he's our priority warrantee.
LEE
Not anymore.
BUCKY
This ain't ours, partner--
LEE
(on edge)
It is now, partner.
Too sheet-covered stretchers are shoved into the coroner's
wagon. The doors slam shut and the car pulls away.
CUT TO:
RUSS MILLARD DIVIDING A STREET ATLAS INTO FOOTBEATS
as fifteen officers (including Lee and Bucky) wait for their
assignment.
A MONTAGE OF QUESTIONING
Cops ring doorbells throughout Leimert Park:
OFFICER
(to an old woman)
Have you heard female screams...
BUCKY
(to an off-duty serviceman)
...anyone discarding women's clothing?
LEE
(to a little kid)
...seen anyone in the lot on 39th...
BUCKY
(to a housewife)
...and what about this man?
(holds out a photo of Junior
Nash)
To all of these questions a big fat "no".
Bucky enters a mob scene. One cop holds up a front page
headline: "Hunt Werewolf's Den in Torture Slaying"
Along a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a
bench. A cop walks by, notes Bucky's confusion:
OFFICER
Confessors.
Just then the interrogation room door opens and Bill Koenig
leads a doubled-over fat man out of the door.
KOENIG
He didn't do it.
A couple officers clap satirically at their desks.
BUCKY
(to another cop)
Blanchard?
OFFICER
In with Loew.(beat) And reporters.
Off Bucky's concerned look we
CUT TO:
A garage apartment at the rear of a big Victorian house. Lee
and Bucky amble up and ring the buzzer.
A skinny man (CLEO SHORT) in his fifties opens the door,
eyeing them narrowly.
CLEO SHORT
Cops, huh?
He leads them inside. The apartment resembles its resident,
soiled, worn and ugly.
CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
I've got an alibi, just in case you think
I did it. Tighter than a crab's ass, and
that is air tight.
The two cops sit down, sizing up his hostility.
BUCKY
I'm Detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This
is Sergeant Blanchard. We'd like to
express our condolences for the loss of
your daughter.
CLEO SHORT
I know who you are. Neither of you'da
lasted a round with Gentleman Jim
Jeffries.
(beat) As for Betty, c'est la vie. She
called the tune, she paid the piper.
(beat) You wanna hear my alibi?
LEE
Since you're so anxious to tell it.
CLEO SHORT
Johnny on the spot at my job. Twenty-
seven straight hours. Refrigerator
repairman. Twenty-seven straight and the
last seventeen overtime. Call my boss.
He'll alibi me up tighter than a popcorn
fart, and that's air tight.
BUCKY
When was the last time you saw your
daughter?
CLEO SHORT
Betty came west in '43 with stars in her
eyes. I promised her three squares and a
five-spot if she kept the house tidy.
The cops look around at the squalor.
CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
Gave her the boot in July. She moved to
Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard couple
weeks later. Some soldier beat her up
bad. Last I heard from her.
BUCKY
Was that soldier her boyfriend?
The old man lets out a hoot.
CLEO SHORT
They were all her boyfriends! Not so ugly
and wearing a uniform, can't go wrong
there. Betty believed in quantity before
quality.
LEE
You calling your own daughter a tramp?
CLEO SHORT
Got five daughters. One bad apple ain't
so bad.
Lee's about to burst. Bucky motions for him to take a walk.
Lee goes through the den into the bathroom. From his view
Bucky can see Lee chase a couple pills with a glass of
water...
BUCKY
Any names, Mr. Short?
CLEO SHORT
Tom, Dick, Harry. Don't matter.
(he drifts for a moment)
Said she was looking for movie work
but...just paraded the Boulevard in those
black get-ups of hers.
Lee returns to the room.
CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
Who wouldn't get herself killed doin'
that? Who? Who wouldn't?
The two men walk out, disgusted.
LEE
Jesus fuck. We just got handed the entire
U.S. Armed forces as suspects.
BUCKY
Flip to see who writes it up?
LEE
I'm staking Nash's pad for the night. See
if we get any strange drive-bys at the
murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in
on Kay. She's worried about me.
BUCKY
She's a smart woman.
Bucky and Koenig walk up to the steps of an apartment house.
BUCKY
How do you want to play this, Sarge?
KOENIG
Fritzie usually does the talking and I
stand back up.
(re a leather sap in his belt)
Muscle job?
BUCKY
Let's try talk job.
Bucky checks names on the doorbells against a couple names on
his piece of paper. He stops at "S. Saddon".
Two men lounge on the stoop. Koenig gives them the eye as he
passes.
Bucky checks his piece of paper against the doorbells again.
Finds "M. Graham" but no Linda Martin.
KOENIG
I'm bored.
BUCKY
This'll just take a minute.
KOENIG
I'm gonna take those two guys outside.
Maybe they knew the cooze--
BUCKY
I'll handle 'em Sarge--
KOENIG
No! I'm gonna do it! (beat) Now what do I
roust 'em about?
BUCKY
I dunno. Ask 'em anything. Alibis. See if
Betty ever engaged in prostitution...
Koenig goes running outside. Bucky shakes his head.
Bucky emerges. Koenig stands on the stoop with the two men,
both of whom look like they might have seen the wrong end of
Koenig's less-than-subtle interrogation style.
KOENIG
(re the men)
They didn't do it.
BUCKY
No shit Sherlock.
Bucky pulls up in front of the house. Heads inside...
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
To be honest, I'd pretty much overdosed
on Betty Short's low-rent last months on
earth and decided to kiss off the rest of
the day and head to Lee and Kay's for a
sandwich.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UPS OF BLACK DAHLIA CRIME SCENE PHOTOS
spread out on Lee and Kay's dining room table.
Bucky stands just inside the door watching Lee study the
photos, Kay a pace or two back, smoking nervously. Neither of
them seem to notice him. Finally Kay sees him:
KAY
Hi, Dwight.
LEE
(wired)
It ain't a random job. Horseshit. Guy who
did this...hated her. Bad. Wanted the
whole goddamn world to know. Babe, you
took pre-Med, whattya think? Mad doctor?
KAY
Lee, Dwight's here.
LEE
Oh, hey partner. Bucky listen to Kay.
Babe's got ideas. Good stuff--
KAY
This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but
I'll give you a theory if you'll eat
something to calm yourself down.
LEE
Theory on, teach.
KAY
Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were
two killers. Because the torture cuts are
crude, while the bisection and the cut on
the abdomen are neat and clean...
CLOSE ON: Lee's face, somehow both intense and unfocused...
VOICE OVER
Three days 'til Bobby De Witt hit LA.
Three days since we killed four men.
BACK ON: BUCKY, who turns on his heels and exits, catching
Kay's eye as he goes.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
Maybe nobody cared. Maybe they cared too
much.
Bucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around
the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap
portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress.
Bucky pulls his car up to a low-slung building with a log-
cabin facade and swinging Western doors. He enters.
The woman gets into a beautiful snow-white Packard.
CUT TO:
SHOTS OF VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
as Bucky tails the white Packard from three car-lengths back.
He follows her all the way from the Valley to Hancock Park.
CUT TO:
As the woman parks her car in front of A HUGE TUDOR MANSION,
Bucky cruises by, catching her license plate and writing it
on a pack of matches from LaVerne's.
In his rear view mirror he sees her exit the car, a striking
figure in a sharkskin suit. He watches her walk up the
enormous lawn and into the home.
Bucky reads the license plate into the phone. He receives
information back and writes it onto the matchbook, as well.
Bucky enters and finds Lee at a desk, manning the tip phones.
LEE
Yes, ma'am. I understand. A werewolf and
Red Manley. Oh no. The werewolf is Red
Manley. Yes that would be more
efficient...
Lee dutifully writes down the crank on a routing slip. Bucky
slides into a chair across from him, brushing imaginary dust
off of the phone in front of him.
Lee rings off. Smiles at Bucky.
LEE (cont'd)
I love tip duty.
BUCKY
So...You smooth things with Kay?
LEE
Yeah. I rented a room for the stuff at
the El Nido Motel. Nine scoots a week.
Chump change if it makes her feel good.
BUCKY
De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was
thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get
Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do it--
Lee swings away in his rotating chair, knocking over a
wastepaper basket.
BUCKY (cont'd)
Lee--
The phone in front of Lee rings. He snatches it--
LEE
Blanchard. Homicide.
Lee listens to the call, not saying anything. It goes on for
some time. Finally Bucky catches Lee's eye. Lee makes the
"looney" sign with his finger.
Bucky's phone rings. He picks it up.
BUCKY
Bleichert. Homicide.
The person on the other line starts rambling on. Bucky takes
notes diligently as we
DISSOLVE TO:
Bucky rings the bell dressed in his Sunday best blazer.
Madeleine answers, a knockout in a skirt and cashmere sweater.
MADELEINE
Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has
heard about you. He insisted you stay for
dinner. I told him we met at that art
exhibit at Stanley Rose's Bookshop, so if
you have to pump everybody for my alibi,
be subtle. All right?
BUCKY
Sure.
She leads him inside.
A cinderblock auto court filled with pre-war jalopies. The
camera closes on a dingy door. Room 11.
Bucky weaves fast through traffic. He whips a right turn...
Bucky's car screeches into the parking lot just as LINDA
MARTIN bursts through the doors and takes off running.
Bucky jumps from the car and sprints after her, the girl
clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in
and out of busy traffic.
The girl runs like a fucking antelope as Bucky barely misses
being hit by a large BEER TRUCK and gets to the other side of
the street just as Linda stumbles over a curb--sending her
sprawling on the sidewalk.
Bucky jumps on her, grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and
screams like a hell cat.
He cuffs her and pulls her up, dragging her to where she
spilled her purse.
LINDA MARTIN
I'm an emancipated minor and if you touch
me without a matron present I'll sue you!
He picks it up her purse. Surprised by the heft, he opens it
and pulls out A METAL FILM CAN.
Her demeanor changes instantly to fear:
LINDA MARTIN
(near tears)
Please, mister...My...my parents.
Russ and Bucky.
RUSS MILLARD
Whattya think?
BUCKY
I think she's covering on the Mex angle.
Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him
taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The
TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg
Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play
cellmate for a day.
RUSS MILLARD
Bleichert you are a very bright penny
today. (beat) Well. Looks like it's blue
movie night at City Hall.
RAYMOND NASH lies dead on the sidewalk. Off to one side, a
short and wiry cop is describing for detectives how it all
went down, pantomiming how he shot an escaping Raymond Nash.
Bucky stands over Nash, staring at his dead features. He
walks inside.
Bucky walks into the house and finds Kay there. She holds up
a newspaper: The front page includes The Black Dahlia, Junior
Nash, and Bobby De Witt.
KAY
(eyes red from crying)
We're famous, Dwight.
BUCKY
Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee?
KAY
I haven't seen him since you beat him up.
Bucky looks ashamed.
KAY (cont'd)
I don't blame you.
He walks to her and she holds him.
BUCKY
He's in trouble, you know.
She nods. He strokes her hair.
BUCKY (cont'd)
De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee
doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over
to stay with you.
KAY
I don't want you coming over here just to
sleep an the couch again.
BUCKY
Kay. Lee--
She holds up a hand, waving him off. She knows all this.
KAY
You know Dwight? Fighting, cops, guns. To
most people--that's the scary stuff. Not
everything else.
She knows him to the core. She steps back, holding his hands.
KAY (cont'd)
Luck.
BUCKY
Short of winning?
KAY
Luck.
Bucky cruises the Tijuana streets: child beggars dig for
breakfast in trash cans, taco venders stir pots of dog-meat
stew, sailors and marines stumble out of whorehouses. Rurales
drive prewar Chevys wearing black uniforms...
VOICE OVER
Back in LA, Linda Short let slip that her
"Mex" was actually a local named Walter
Wellington, who copped to making the film
but quickly provided the cops his alibi
for the Dahlia's missing days.
Bucky parks at a big pink Art Deco hotel (The Divisidero).
Bucky and Fritz Vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists,
hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs, zoot suit youths
prowling for drunks to roll...
The two men park the car in the middle of a car-choked street
and decide to try walking. They're immediately swallowed up
by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces.
Bucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the
children scatter, squabbling over the coins.
IN THE BACKGROUND
Fritz Vogel approaches a Rurale and talks to him. The Rurale
nods yes, gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock
building.
CUT TO:
Bucky rings the doorbell. Fritz Vogel answers.
VOGEL
Boyo! Glad you could make it.
He claps Bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house.
as four manacled men are being loaded into a drunk wagon
while Bucky flips through their rap sheets and mug shots.
INSIDE THE DRUNK WAGON
the four men sit in the back as Bucky drives the truck. The
camera pans their faces. The first, LOREN BIDWELL, pale, old
and palsied.
VOICE OVER
On my way over I played out their rap
sheets in my head, trying to work up a
head of hate...Loren Bidwell, three time
Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated
sexual assault on minors. Between prison
jolts he confessed to all the big sex
crimes.
Bucky pulls the drunk wagon up to a building, its street
facade illuminated: "KOUNTY KING LUNCH MEAT--SERVING L.A.
COUNTY WITH INSTITUTIONAL FOOD SINCE 1923"...
THE CAMERA finds the second man, CECIL DURKIN.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
Cecil Durkin--hophead, knife fighter and
a jailhouse rape-o who played jazz drums
with some good combos. He took two
Quentin jolts for Arson and was caught
masturbating at the scene of his last
torch.
AT THE FRONT OF THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING
Fritz Vogel opens the door and leads the men inside.
Bucky picks his way through passed-out drunks and bums. He's
back in uniform.
VOICE OVER
East 5th Street from Main to Stanford.
Blood banks, liquor stores selling half
pints and short dogs exclusively, fifty-
cent-a-night flophouses and derelict
missions...
DOWN THE STREET
two officers brutally herd winos into a drunk wagon. Bucky
turns and walks the other direction, refusing to help. They
see him and sneer.
VOICE OVER
Banished by Ellis Loew, who dared me to
try my word against a twenty-two year man
and the city's future District Attorney.
I confined the truth to Russ and Kay, and
determined to spend my shifts trying to
be the worst foot hack in history.
He hands a quarter to a drunk as he passes, urging him with
his nightstick to crawl back into a bar.
Bucky stakes out the dark house.
Bucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back
door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock. He slides
into the house...
as they cruise the streets of skid row. While Russ talks
Bucky fills a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE with an amber liquid...
RUSS MILLARD
I'll be a chimp's priest, Buck. A chimp's
priest--watch the air bubbles--I shoulda
known that Johnny I d need a pro to lose
his cherry...Never had 'em for a kink and
a cherry, though...
Bucky points out the window.
BUCKY
There.
OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALK
Johnny Vogel wrestles with two drunks, kicking at them as
they scamper into some trash.
BUCKY
(exiting the car)
Johnny--
Johnny ambles over to Bucky.
JOHNNY VOGEL
Whatcha doin' in civvies, Bleichert?
Bucky drills him in the solar plexus, doubling him over. He
grabs Vogel by the hair and slams his head into the roof of
the car as Johnny's lights dIm...
CUT TO:
THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR - SECONDS LATER
as Russ Millard injects the needle into Johnny's arm.
CUT TO:
Bucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by.
Russ leans out the window and hands Bucky the statement.
RUSS MILLARD
His statement. Signed.
Bucky reads it and slips it into his pocket.
RUSS MILLARD
We should sit on this for a little bit.
Until I can talk to a legal officer.
Bucky shakes his head no, climbs back inside the window.
Bucky jogs up the steps inside.
Kay and Bucky sit on a bench, looking out at the water.
KAY
I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to
Santa Barbara, or even a drive to San
Francisco...
BUCKY
Kay.
FAY
You don't owe him a thing, Bucky. I know
you won't believe me. But you've more
than repaid him already.
He looks at her and she knows it's useless.
KAY (cont'd)
When?
BUCKY
First thing.
She takes his hand.
KAY
You're a fool, Dwight.
as Bucky crosses the border into Mexico.
VOICE OVER
I closed out my glory days the only way I
knew how--I chased the gone man.
Bucky hands out pennies and nickels to locals, flashing both
his badge and snapshots of Lee.
CUT TO:
BUCKY AND AN ENTOURAGE OF TRAILING LOCALS
as Bucky tries to shake them, pulling out his pockets to show
them he has no more coins.
CUT TO:
BUCKY QUESTIONING TIJUANA COPS
graduating from small change to one dollar bills. Same of
them seem to have stories to tell.
VOICE OVER
I got headshakes, bullshit broadsides and
a strange series of tales that rang true.
One had "el blanco explosivo" beating the
shit out of three jack rollers, then
buying off the cops with double-saws
peeled from a large roll.
Another had Lee donating 200 scoots to a
leper ministry priest and then driving to
Ensenada.
EXT - THE COASTAL ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON
as Bucky drives South, passing a sign which says "ENSENADA
60 MI."
He passes a cluster of families walking on the side of the
road. They carry suitcases and head North.
Bucky approaches Ensenada. The trickle of families headed
north has now becoming a roadside migration march. Every
fifth of sixth marcher carries a torch or lantern.
Bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown
he's ever seen:
Rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the
northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to
their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags
of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers
attached to their belts.
Two Rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless
with the butts of their sawed-off shotguns.
VOICE OVER
I decided it would be wise to check in
with the law before going out to question
the Ensenada citizenry.
Bucky stands outside a converted church with the word POLICIA
painted in black over religious scenes.
as Bucky pulls two hairs from his head and spit-glues them to
the door jamb.
Garish neon, military personnel. Brownshirts packing serious
weapons keeping the mostly white street crowd in order.
HIS POV: An adobe streetfront with a neon sign: "CLUB BOXEO".
Bucky goes inside.
Bucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through
the crowds. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple
Rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him.
He dodges down an alley and cuts down another street,
breaking into a slow jog.
Bucky walks backwards, checking the crowd. He's lost them.
Dolphine drives his car while Bucky trains his gun on him.
They come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff
overlooking the ocean. A HUGE WOODEN BURNING CROSS marks the
spot.
DOLPHINE
The locals keep the damn thing lit up.
They got a lotta missing relatives.
BUCKY
You got a shovel?
DOLPHINE
Gardening tools--
BUCKY
Good enough.
Bucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence, wraps it in a
rag and lights a torch off of the cross. Dolphine kicks at a
filthy American flag in the sand.
DOLPHINE
Here. Supposed to be near el bannero.
CUT TO:
A SMALL SHOVEL PUSHING INTO THE GROUND
as Dolphine digs at gun point. After a few strokes the crunch
of the shovel hitting bone.
Bucky terrified to look but has to know--
--a white jumper--
DOLPHINE
Sailor's uniform. It's a sailor...
Bucky breathes out hard. Unbearable. Dolphine digs on,
pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he
sand.
Bucky can't stand the suspense. He tucks his gun into his
waistband and grabs the shovel. After a few more strokes the
thump of something solid.
And suddenly it's there--sunburned pink skin, blond hair and
stitch scars on the eyebrows.
Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard.
And Bucky's in Dolphine's truck while Dolphine's screaming
for him to wait and Bucky slams the truck in reverse,
knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out
of the sand onto the road, heading north and leaving Dolphine
and Lee alone at the grave...Heading north like a refugee...
Bucky's car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine, trying
not to make any noise.
The sun comes up, illuminating Bucky's filthy face as he
watches the picture-perfect house, wishing time would stand
still. Or better yet, wishing it would go back...
Finally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into
the house.
DISSOLVE TO:
A LAPD CHAPLAIN READING SOLEMNLY FROM A BIBLE
But as the camera PULLS BACK we see Bucky in his dress blues
standing next to Kay in a wedding dress.
Russ Millard and Harry Sears stand by as the only two guests.
VOICE OVER
Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not because
their shack job was against department
regs, but because the ghosts of their
past had forced them to choose between
love and passion, the veneer of a "fairy
tale" only a band-aid for a fractured
life.
DISSOLVE TO:
LEE AND KAY DANCING TOGETHER
as Harry and Russ drink from a punch bowl...
VOICE OVER
Our true vows were made in private; bury
the past, bury our ghosts, and as Kay
said, "bury that fucking girl"...
ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER FORM: "Officer Dwight
Bleichert...Reassigned to: Scientific investigation
Detail"
Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a
technician's canvas bag.
An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door.
WOMAN
Yes?
BUCKY
I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express
my condolences, Mrs.--
WOMAN
Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted.
You're the lab man?
He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows.
JANE CHAMBERS
It's the study in back of the dining
room. You'll see the police rope. If
you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden.
He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening.
Lee leads Kay out of the courtroom.
BACK ON THE SCENE
as Kay leans down next to Bucky, gently putting her hand on
his shoulder...
KAY
Then last year...the fourth man--the
driver--he heard Bobby was getting
paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt
that Lee framed him. He wanted money we
didn't have. Ten thousand dollars.
BUCKY
Ever. Were you ever...?
KAY
Promise me this: Forgive him for DeWitt.
Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't
matter anymore. Not to us.
BUCKY
Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell
me!
He's in her face now. Okay, pal, you asked for it.
KAY
Baxter Fitch.
Three black man and a white man get rousted by Lee and Bucky.
BAXTER FITCH
Blanchard?
Chaos erupts as Lee executes Baxter Fitch and Bucky kills two
others...
BACK TO THE SCENE
on Bucky's anguished face:
KAY (cont'd)
He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him
everything else. But don't forgive him
for that. Ever.
She reaches for his face and he pulls away.
SLO-MO CLOSE-UP...
as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor,
into the blackness...
WE FADE UP TO:
Bucky and Jane drink iced tea. A glorious garden behind them.
JANE CHAMBERS
So. What brings you around again?
Considering a courtin' the old rich
widow?
BUCKY
You're not that old. And you're not very
widowed.
JANE CHAMBERS
You either are or you aren't.
BUCKY
You seem to be doing all right.
JANE CHAMBERS
Eldridge had cancer. I half expected it.
We weren't that close anymore...You married?
BUCKY
Little over a year.
JANE CHAMBERS
God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is there?
Bucky's face betrays his difficulties.
JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
Sorry.
BUCKY
So how well do you know the Spragues?
JANE CHAMBERS
Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They
served on the California real estate
board together. But Emmett was a bit of a
crook. My husband got him kicked off the
board for building dangerous buildings
under phony corporations.
BUCKY
Your husband sounds like a good man.
JANE CHAMBERS
He had his moments. Most of it was out of
guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro.
When he learned he had cancer, he really
started feeling guilty. He voted
Democratic last year. Even went in and
had meetings with the City Council. I'm
sure he gave them dirt on Emmett.
BUCKY
I read an article in the paper.
JANE CHAMBERS
Same day Eldridge killed himself.
Apropos, I guess.
BUCKY
Maybe your husband--
JANE CHAMBERS
My husband was rich and did a mean
Charleston. I loved him until I found out
he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting
to love him again. How strange.
BUCKY
It's not so strange.
They watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A
strange emotional peace.
JANE CHAMBERS
You're very accepting of other people's
frailties. You're young. You should have
illusions.
BUCKY
I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard
issue.
JANE CHAMBERS
So how'd a cop get mixed up with
Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I
assume?
Bucky's gut clenches.
BUCKY
I stopped her at a red light. One thing
led to another. Why do you assume it was
Madeleine?
JANE CHAMBERS
Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a
roundheels. Always has been.
BUCKY
Jane. Don't be catty.
JANE CHAMBERS
I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure.
She probably inherited it from her
mother.
Before Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced
tea. The visit is over.
JANE CHAMBERS
You figure out the rest, officer.
He follows her back inside.
Bucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He
slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to
discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on.
We hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to
night...
And down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the
shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur.
Bucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as
Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box.
Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not...
Bucky leans against the window, propping himself up.
ACROSS THE STREET
Madeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky
guns his car to follow...
Bucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot.
He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out
of her car he is staggered:
It's ELIZABETH SHORT.
Or, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like
the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black
dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides
into the bar...
Bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier
loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the
office with the key and lets the two of them in.
He watches as the light goes on; and then off.
Bucky back in uniform again. This time, the black slums.
Heroin hookers, hard-core dealers, gangs.
VOICE OVER
Newton Street Division. Footbeat hacks
carried metal-studded saps; squadroom
dicks packed .45 automatics loaded with
unregulation dum-dums.
Bucky in his patrol car. The night a hot sweat. He listens to
music on his radio and watches two hookers dance on the
corner, waving at cars.
A SCRAGGLY OLD WINO staggers up to the women, stumbling
around them, dancing with them. They sneer at him, tell him
to beat it.
INSIDE THE PATROL CAR
Bucky flashes his headlights at the bum. The bum ignores him.
Bucky flashes them again, annoyed.
The bum looks into the glare and flips Bucky off.
And suddenly Bucky snaps, jumping from his car. In three big
strides he's on the bum, clobbering him with roundhouse lefts
and rights.
The women are screaming. The drunk is screaming.
OLD DRUNK
Pleease!
Bucky drops him, staggering into a phone booth. He drops a
nickel in the phone. Dials a number. Ring. Ring. Ring...
He hangs up. Dials another. A woman's voice answers.
BUCKY
It's me.
Bucky's just onto the porch steps when Madeleine answers the
door. She's dressed like the Dahlia.
He pushes her inside.
VOICE OVER
It was a reunion of avowed tramps, old
rutters who knew they'd never have it as
good with anyone else...
Afterwards we'd talk through the night.
The Spragues...Crazy Papa Bleichert...
As Bucky cruises by, grinning. He salutes the house.
VOICE OVER
In the scheme of things it wasn't much.
Rich old lady gossip, as Jane put it.
CUT TO:
as he drives onto his own modest street.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
But combine it with banging Madeleine in
all twenty-two rooms of their mansion, it
was good enough for me.
A moving van in the driveway and Kay's Plymouth stuffed with
boxes. Bucky double-parks and bolts up the steps.
The van pulls away behind him.
BUCKY
(to the van driver)
Hey! Goddammit! Get back here!
The van driver ignores him; Bucky turns as Kay walks out onto
the porch.
KAY
I didn't touch your things. You can have
the furniture.
BUCKY
Babe--
KAY
Did you think I'd let my husband
disappear for three weeks and do nothing
about it? I've had detectives following
you, Dwight. Detectives. She looks like
that fucking dead girl, so you can have
her--not me.
BUCKY
Babe. Goddammit.
He reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range.
KAY
Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile.
She spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns
the engine and disappears.
Bucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon
to anyone who would do him harm.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
You traded a good woman for skunk pussy,
you've turned everything that's been
handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your
"I will's" amount to the eighth round at
the Academy gym when you stepped into a
Blanchard right hand--pratfalling into
clover that you turned into horse dung.
ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION
No clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the
couch. She reaches down and pulls off her pumps. Now she
reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings.
Not sexy. Empty and resigned.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
Bye-bye Betty, Beth, Betsy, Liz, we were
a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't
meet before 39th and Norton, it just
might have worked. Maybe us would've been
the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up
past redemption...
An apartment complex has been erected at the murder site.
ANGLE ON: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the sign
changes, the "D" dropping off the end. It now reads
"HOLLYWOODLAN".
Bucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on
a working class residential street. He stares across at a
modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize
it hopefully; we've been here before.
It's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky
peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk.
He walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to
his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the
Victorian house and rings the bell.
Footsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical
twin to Elizabeth Short.
Bucky is stunned and can't find his tongue.
GIRL
(Boston accent)
Can I help you? (no response). Great.
Take a hike you big sicko--
BUCKY
Wait--
She begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it
back open.
Cleo Short, Elizabeth's father.
CLEO SHORT
It's all right, dear. I know this pug.
Cleo follows Bucky out onto the porch. Christine reads a copy
of Photoplay. The cover touts the current Mack Sennett
Revival in honor of the revised Hollywoodland sign...
BUCKY
Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if--
CLEO SHORT
Get a life, Bleichert. Don't dream it all
away. Dreamin'll kill ya.
(to Christine)
You, too. Get me a sandwich.
He snatches away the Photoplay and slaps it into Bucky's
hands.
CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
Clean up some dog shit with this for me,
willya?
The man winks. Bucky takes the magazine and salutes him with
it. He heads back down the walk. Behind him Cleo Short
watches him go.
Bucky sits at a light, staring north. Scaffolding drapes the
Hollywoodland sign. Movie lights have been set up, capturing
the event on film.
His attention turns to Christine's Photoplay on the seat next
to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the Mack Sennett
revival:
A reproduction of the Hollywoodland sign across the top of
the page, and below it the words "Keystone Kops at the
Admiral Theater--Air conditioned!"
Below that a still from a Keystone Kops movie, registering
huge and loud and wrong: Three Keystone Kops standing between
pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall
inset with Egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them.
Unmistakably the background that appeared in the Linda
Martin/Betty Short porn film.
Cars honking behind him. Bucky's transfixed by the image. The
light is green.
He jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection.
CUT TO:
Bucky buys a ticket underneath a marquee which reads MACK
SENNETT REVIVAL".
as Bucky bursts out into the evening, the lights on the
Hollywood hill catching his attention.
A huge area is cordoned off as people watch the sign being
torn down.
Bucky and Russ leave the car there, badge the local blue
doing crowd control, and split off down a dirt side road into
the woods.
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
For the first time since the beginning of
the whole fiasco, I stopped trying to
figure out who killed Elizabeth Short.
Instead, I focused on where.
Bucky and Russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper, like
two men consulting a treasure map in the woods.
In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown
out and the door hanging off its hinges.
VOICE OVER
And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't
have to look any further than one of
Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One
that was isolated...abandoned...
They walk on, leaving this particular bungalow behind.
Bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it
deeper into the night...
VOICE OVER
...and most importantly, close to a water
source...where one could drain a body of
its blood.
Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see
THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW
teetering on the edge of the stream. Empty window and doors
hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death
leer.
Bucky and Russ feel it, tensing up as they approach. They
pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and
step into the abandoned house.
The last of the "LAND" letters has come down and a party has
ensued. A marching band plays "There's No Business Like Show
Business".
Bucky and Russ stumble out of the woods, carrying the
evidence of Betty Short's death in their hands.
Bucky edges his way along the side of the house. A side
window is open and he pulls himself inside.
Bucky stands in front of a plain grave marker: "George
Tilden. 1906 - 1948.
War Hero and Loyal Friend"
VOICE OVER
When I'd pulled George's print card that
morning, I'd already laid fifty down with
Russ that he was our guy. Amateur
taxidermist, transient. If he was a cop
39th and Norton woulda been right in the
middle of his beat...
Bucky watches as Russ tips the gas lantern over on its side,
the gas leaking out into the tin shed.
VOICE OVER
Maybe he'd have gone for a gun or
probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists
would've given way to a full load of .45
in the chest.
Bucky and Russ step outside. Russ lights a match and tosses
it inside. Flames begin to eat away the bloody mattress...
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
Sprague said they found him croaked in a
parking lot downtown, just twelve blocks
from where he'd dumped Betty Short. Just
croaked. Natural causes, if anything
about crazy Georgie was natural. I hoped
the evil ate him from the inside out,
filling him with blackness like the
sawdust in Sprague's goddamn dog. (beat)
Bucky kicks the tin door shut, sealing the fire inside
Elizabeth Short's private hell.
Bucky runs to his car, pulls out his gun. He sprints off down
the street...
Bucky waits outside, watching from behind a tree. He watches
as the last of the cars, Madeleine's, pulls out of the
driveway.
He crosses the street. He tries the front door, surprised to
find it unlocked. He goes inside.
Madeleine Sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office
over to the now familiar Room 11. They enter, shutting the
door and flicking on the light to reveal
BUCKY
sitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat. He
trains his silenced pistol on them. Flashing his badge, he
points the soldier to the door:
BUCKY
(quoting Lee)
Adios yourself back to the Halls of
Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business
with the lady.
You don't have to tell the soldier twice. He backs out and
shuts the door.
BUCKY
I've been pointing my gun at a lot of
people this week. But I haven't had much
of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya
think?
MADELEINE
I think you'd rather fuck me than kill
me. But you don't have the guts to do
either. You're a boxer. Not a puncher.
Bucky smiles.
BUCKY
(Scotchman's burr)
Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short
to the very end, eh?
Now she's curious.
BUCKY (cont'd)
It's not as good as yours, I'll admit.
But then again you've got an ear for
accents. Accents, dressing up in
costumes...
Maybe a trace of fear in her eyes...
BUCKY (cont'd)
Do another one for me. Play someone else.
Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's
girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do
another.
MADELEINE
I don't know what you're talking about--
He cocks the gun.
BUCKY
How 'bout the Mexican accent you used
when you hired the private dick to track
down Lee. Let's see the make-up job.
Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita,
that you wore when you chased after poor
daddy's money. Tell me something--you
shoot Lee yourself?
She steps back against the door as he advances.
BUCKY (cont'd)
Did you at least have the guts to shoot
him yourself?
He puts the gun to her forehead.
MADELEINE
You'll never do it. Never. Remember...I
look like her.
She grins wickedly.
He pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap.
Cap cars, flashing lights, an ambulance.
VOICE OVER
We took the fall together.
As Madeleine, dressed as a Mexican woman in heavy makeup and
a large hat, tails Lee back to his motel...
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
Madeleine stalking Lee...Revenge-killing
him in Ensenada to avenge the Sprague
honor...No mention of the Black Dahlia
murder case at all.
Madeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers. Her
family linked arm-and-arm in the background, crying, only
Martha looking like she might survive...
VOICE OVER (cont'd)
Her story's enough to get her a psych tag
as a delusional schizophrenic and ten
years at Atascadero State Hospital.
