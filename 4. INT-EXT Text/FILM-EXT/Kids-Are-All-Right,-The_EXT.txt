NIC ALLGOOD (late 40's) pulls up into the driveway beside a
beat up white TRUCK covered in AA slogan bumper stickers.

18
We see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes
and putting them in the back of a truck. This is PAUL, Joni
and Laser's biological father.
25

Paul anxiously paces his overgrown back-yard on his cell
phone. He picks weeds as he talks. Conversation intercut.
14.
PAUL
Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood.
JONI
This is she...
PAUL
Hi.
This is Paul...
(clearing his throat)
Uh, your donor...?
JONI
Oh!
Hi...
Joni shoots up out of her chair and starts leaving the room
to get some privacy away from her mom.
PAUL
Is this a good time to talk?
JONI
(flustered)
Yeah...
JULES
Where are you going?
It's your
turn.
Joni doesn't answer.
She just walks out to her backyard.
PAUL
So...
(doesn't know what to say)
How are you?
JONI
I'm good.
How are you?
PAUL
I'm well, thanks.
Banal, awkward pause.
Paul jumps in to fill the void.
PAUL (CONT'D)
So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you
call--
Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike.
15.
JONI
Actually, my brother
asked if I'd
call you because I'm
18 and he's
only 15 which is too
young to call--
anyway, he'd like to
meet you...if
you want to...
PAUL
(thrown)
Your brother?
JONI
Yeah. Well, technically my half-
brother. Each of my moms had a
kid, you know, with your sperm...
PAUL
No.
I didn't know.
JONI
Oh.
PAUL
Both of them?
JONI
Yeah.
PAUL
Like in two?
JONI
Uh huh.
Like in gay.
PAUL
Good deal.
I love lesbians.
Paul cringes at his lameness.
Joni doesn't know what to say.
OMITTED.
26

27
27
Joni and Laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant
to meet Paul. They're both clearly nervous.
JONI
I just don't want you to have big
expectations.
16.
LASER
Will you quit saying that?
I don't
have any expectations.
JONI
Okay. I'm just saying he
might be weird. I mean, he donated
sperm...
LASER
Well if he hadn't done it, you
wouldn't be here. So respect, yo!
29
29
They all sit eating.
Paul can't help but study their faces.
PAUL
Listen, feel free and ask me
anything you want, okay?
(off their stares)
Or we can just hang out. That's
fine too. Whatever you guys want.
LASER/JONI
Okay.
Paul presses on, trying to break the ice.
PAUL
Anything you want to ask me, Laser?
LASER
I...uh...I didn't really have any
specific questions...
PAUL
(helping him out)
That's fine. I'd love to know
about you guys. What about you,
Joni? What are you up to?
JONI
Uh, well, I just graduated high
school. I'm starting college in
the fall.
PAUL
Oh yeah?
Congratulations.
18.
LASER
Joni's the brains in the family.
She won a National Merit
Scholarship.
PAUL
Shut the front door!
LASER
Yeah. And she got like an 800 on
her Verbal SAT.
JONI
Okay, Laser...
LASER
What? I'm just saying you're
really smart.
JONI
No, I just work harder than you.
PAUL
Don't stress it, Laze. School
wasn't my thing either and I turned
out okay.
LASER
(re: his name)
Laser.
PAUL
I'm sorry. Laser.
(beat)
So tell me about you, Laser. What
are you into?
Laser freezes.
So his sister jumps in.
JONI
Laser's an amazing athlete.
PAUL
Oh yeah?
LASER
Did you play any sports in school?
PAUL
I played a little basketball in
junior high.
19.
LASER
That's it?
PAUL
Pretty much. The whole "team"
thing got on my nerves, you know
like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass,
man!" What about you?
LASER
I play some Soccer. Basketball.
Baseball. You know, team sports.
Paul realizes he's put his foot in his mouth.
PAUL
Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in
general. Teams are great. I'm
just weird like that.
LASER
Yeah, I like teams.
We can tell Laser is growing frustrated at his inability to
connect with Paul. Joni jumps in.
JONI
So this is your place?
PAUL
Yeah, I've been working on it for a
while. I also have this organic co-
op farm down the road. We use a
lot of the stuff we grow there for
the restaurant.
JONI
(excited)
That's so cool.
I'm totally into
local.
LASER
(busting her)
You are?
JONI
Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like
trying to get moms to buy local for
forever.
Laser tries again to reconnect.
20.
LASER
So, like, do you raise pigs and
stuff?
PAUL
No.
No pigs...
(beat)
But it's a great spot. You guys
should come check it out sometime.
JONI
Yeah...Definitely...
Excited, Joni turns to Laser.
He seems uninterested.
30
30
The kids and Paul exit the restaurant. Paul walks to a
classic BMW motorcycle. Lasers tries to hide his awe.
LASER
Is that yours?
PAUL
Yeah.
You like motorcycles?
LASER
Yeah, but...our moms are kind of
anti-motorcycle.
JONI
And by "kind of" he means they'd
kill us if we ever rode one.
PAUL
That's too bad.
They're fun.
Time to say goodbye. Again, no one knows the protocol here.
After an awkward beat, Paul holds out his arms for hugs.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Well it was great to meet you guys.
He and Joni hug.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I hope this was okay.
JONI
Yeah...totally...thank you.
Now Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug.
21.
PAUL
Really nice to meet you, Laser.
LASER
Yeah.
Joni gives a quick wave to Paul. She turns to go and Laser
follows. Paul watches them walk away. He looks stirred up
by the meeting.

Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over
Laser's bike.
45

Paul rides slowly down the street, checking addresses. He
pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the Allgood house.
OMITTED

Paul rings the bell. Waits. The door opens and Nic and
Jules are there smiling with "kill him with kindness" faces.
NIC
Paul! It is so great to meet you.
I'm Nic. This is Jules.
Paul shakes their hands.
PAUL
Hi, great to meet you two.
JULES
I hope the traffic wasn't too bad.
PAUL
No, I've got my bike so...I just
sort of weave through.
Nic clocks the motorcycle, stifles the impulse to judge.
NIC
Great.
Well, come on in.
As they enter, Paul holds out a bottle of wine.
PAUL
This is for you. I don't know if
you guys like wine...
Nic takes it.
NIC
Are you kidding? We love it.
(checking the label)
And a Petit Syrah. What a treat!
Let me get some glasses.
Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules. Little silence.
Jules steals a look at him, unable to contain her curiosity.
33.
PAUL
Beautiful house.
How long you guys
lived here?
JULES
Almost ten years. Wait, has it
been that long?
(rambling nervously)
We moved right after Laser broke
his leg, I remember that because we
had a ramp for a while, so that
would have been...ten, no, nine?
No, ten years this fall.
Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness.
PAUL
Okay.
Laser and Joni enter. Joni lights up when she sees Paul.
Jules watches Paul hug her. Uncomfortable, she heads for
THE KITCHEN --
Jules finds Nic's pouring herself a sizable glass of wine.
JULES
You okay?
NIC
(not okay)
Yeah. Fine.
Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest.
JULES
Go easy on the wine, hon.
It's day
time.
NIC
Okay. And same goes for the micro-
managing...
48
48
Everyone sits at the picnic table.
JULES
I hope the food's okay. Joni told
us you own a restaurant.
34.
PAUL
The food's great. Can't go wrong
with salmon and corn.
Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.
NIC
So Paul, did you always know you
wanted to be in food-services
industry?
Paul smiles at Nic, trying to disarm her.
PAUL
Well, I always liked food.
NIC
No, I was asking because I remember
reading in your file, back when we
were looking for, you know, sperm,
anyway, you said you were studying
international relations.
PAUL
Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time
ago. Yeah, I was considering it,
but then I dropped out of school.
JONI
You dropped out of college?
PAUL
Yeah, it wasn't my thing.
NIC
(squinching)
No?
Why's that?
PAUL
It just seemed like a massive waste
of money after a while. I mean, I
wasn't "doing" anything. I was
just sitting on my ass listening to
people spout off ideas I could've
just as easily learned reading a
book.
Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I'm not saying higher learning
uniformly sucks. I mean, college
is great for some people.
(MORE)
35.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love
it. That's just me. I'm just
weird that way.
(beat)
Which is probably why I ended up in
the food-services industry.
LASER
See what he did there, mom? You
said "food-services industry," then
he said "food-services industry..."
NIC
Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks.
(apropos of nothing)
So, Paul, what about your social
life?
PAUL
My social life?
NIC
You know, are you married,
divorced, seeing anyone?
JONI
Mom!
NIC
What?
We're getting to know Paul.
PAUL
No, never been married or divorced.
I date a little, but I'm just kind
of focused on my work right now.
NIC
Oh.
Paul wants a break from the heat.
PAUL
So, how'd you guys meet?
Jules smiles, embarrassed.
Nic jumps in.
NIC
We met at UCLA. I was a resident
in the ER and Jules had an
emergency.
JULES
My tongue went numb.
36.
PAUL
Really?
THUD!
We turn to see Laser, pounding his head on the table.
JULES
Laser, that's not nice.
LASER
What's not nice is subjecting your
kids to the same story 1000 times!
PAUL
(ignoring Laser)
What happened to your tongue?
JULES
I don't know. I just lost all the
feeling in my face and tongue and I
thought I might gag and then, you
know...
PAUL
Choke?
Die?...
JULES
Yeah...exactly...
NIC
Well it was pretty clear to me she
was just having an anxiety attack
and she'd be fine.
PAUL
So what'd you do for her?
NIC
Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get
her to relax, talk, move her tongue
around.
LASER
Mom, that's gross!
JULES
(ignoring Laser, to Nic)
Actually, she started teasing me
and that really helped.
NIC
I was trying to distract you.
37.
JULES
I know. And it worked. You were
really funny.
NIC
You were really pretty.
Nic reaches over and caresses Jules' hand.
Joni rolls her
eyes, embarrassed.
JULES
So that's it. My tongue started
working again.
NIC
And we've been glued at the hip
ever since.
PAUL
That's a great story.
JULES
(beaming)
We like it.
Laser and Joni share a look.
PAUL
So Nic, I know you're a doctor.
How `bout you, Jules? What do you
do?
Jules never likes this question.
JULES
Well, I, you know, I studied
architecture in college...
PAUL
Right...
JULES
But I'm not an architect. I mean I
was on my way to becoming one. But
I quit before the kids were born.
PAUL
Well, that happens...
JULES
When they got a little older, I
started a Balinese furniture import
business...
38.
PAUL
Right on.
JULES
Yeah.
But that didn't work out.
PAUL
Well, business aren't easy--
JULES
Actually, I'm in the process of
starting a new business.
PAUL
Good for you. What kind?
JULES
Landscape design...
(before he can respond)
But not like a gardener! I mean,
yes, there's a gardening component
to it, but the real work is to
create unique, eco-friendly outdoor
spaces that harmonize with the
surrounding environment. Do you
know what I mean?
PAUL
Absolutely.
In Nic's mind, Jules is drowning in verbiage.
So she jumps
in to save her.
NIC
Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about
her graduation speech?
PAUL
No, she didn't.
NIC
It was incredible. So full of
wisdom and hope...
(turning to her Joni)
Hon, go get it. I'm sure he'd love
to hear it...
JONI
(blushing)
No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't...
39.
NIC
Sure he would.
Come on.
Go get
it...
JONI
(getting upset)
No, it's okay...
NIC
Sweetie, don't be embarrassed.
JONI
I'm not embarrassed!
Jesus!
Give
it a rest already!
This outburst stuns Nic into silence. Her daughter has never
spoken to her like this. Laser stands up.
LASER
I'll get the ice-cream.
JONI
(standing up)
I'll help you.
Joni and Laser leave the room. Nic pours herself the last of
Paul's Petit Syrah. Jules smiles, covering her anxiety.
JULES
(softly)
Honey, that's your forth glass.
NIC
Actually, it's my third.
But
thanks for counting.
Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood.
PAUL
Hey, I was just thinking. You
know, I bought this place last year
and the backyard's a wreck. Would
you be interested in working on it?
JULES
(insecure)
Oh, that's okay.
PAUL
No, seriously. I don't have time
to work on it myself.
40.
JULES
Thank you. That's really sweet.
Why don't you think about it.
PAUL
Why?
I just did.
(then)
I mean, if you're not up for it
that's okay--
JULES
(jumping on it)
No! I am!
(getting excited)
I'm up for it!...
Jules smiles at Nic: "Isn't this great?
My first client."
Nic looks less than pleased.
OMITTED.

Jules drives slowly up the hill looking for Paul's address.
She sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old
truck and a motorcycle.
52
52
Jules and Paul walk through Paul's backyard, evaluating.
JULES
...We could do a kind of a Secret
Garden thing with trellises and
topiary...
(clocking his face)
...or something more Asian,
minimal, with a rock garden feel.
It's up to you...
PAUL
What do you think?
JULES
Personally, I'm tired of minimal.
I'm into more is more. Let's not
try to tame the space. I think it
would look great all lush and
overgrown and fecund...
PAUL
Fecund?
JULES
I'm sorry, you know, fertile...
42.
PAUL
No, I love that word. You just
don't hear it that often.
(thinking)
More is more. Yeah. Let's do that.
Jules is staring at Paul.
PAUL (CONT'D)
What?
JULES
Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids
in your expressions...
Jules looks more intensely at Paul's face.
JULES (CONT'D)
You and Laser have the same mouth.
PAUL
You think so?
JULES
Yeah.
The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind
of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected.
53
53
Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese
take-out for the family dinner.
NIC
What's the score?
JULES
Pretty close.
Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.
LASER
20-3...match point.
NIC
So how'd it go today?
JULES
Great.
We settled on a concept.
43.
NIC
What is it?
JULES
It's hard to explain. You have to
kind of see the space to get it.
NIC
(to Laser)
Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get
Well card?
(off his silence)
Laser! What do I have to do?! I
bought you a card. I left it on
your desk. All you had to do was--
LASER
Mom, settle! I will...
NIC
Don't tell me to settle, mister.
And if it's not in the mail by
tomorrow morning, we're not going
to the Dodger game Saturday.
LASER
Whatever, I have other plans
anyway.
NIC
What other plans?
(off his silence)
I'm asking you a quest--
LASER
I said I'd do something with Paul!
Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He
tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells:
NIC
You used to be so cute!
54
54
We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something.
Laser
is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.
PAUL
This may not be a good idea.
44.
CLAY (O.S.)
Are you filming?!
We cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall.
He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land
his board on the ground.
PAUL
(to Laser)
He's not gonna make it.
(calling to Clay)
Clay, you're not gonna make it!
LASER
I think he may be right, dude.
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
CLAY
Will you quit being a man-gina and
run the camera! I'm only doing
this once so keep my shit in frame!
Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser,
wondering why he puts up with this guy.
VIDEO CAMERA'S POV: We watch as Clay psychs himself up
with
an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps. Finally,
he
starts down the ledge. He starts his jump, catches air
and
hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. We see him go
into
the dumpster and land with a nauseating THUD. Paul and
Laser
rush up and look over the edge.
PAUL/LASER
ARE YOU OKAY?!
There's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony.
CLAY
Did you get that?!
LASER
Seriously, dude, are you okay?
CLAY
I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you
fucking get it?!
55
55
Paul and Laser walk over to Paul's truck.
45.
PAUL
Maybe next time we can hang out
just you and me.
LASER
Clay's cool. He's just gets a
little amped sometimes.
PAUL
That's not amped.
That's being a
dick.
LASER
He's not a dick, that's just his
way.
PAUL
Okay...I just didn't like the way
he was talking to you.
LASER
(defensive)
Well, you don't know him.
PAUL
(back-peddling)
You're right...I don't...
LASER
Hey, can I ask you a question?
PAUL
Sure.
LASER
Why'd you donate sperm?
PAUL
Well, it's a lot more fun then
donating blood.
Laser doesn't laugh.
Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a
"non-joke" answer.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I don't know, I guess I thought,
you know, if I can help somebody in
need, somebody who wants a baby...
Laser's not really buying that.
LASER
So you did it to help people?
46.
PAUL
It was a long time ago...
LASER
How much did you get paid?
PAUL
Why do you want to know?
LASER
I'm just curious.
PAUL
I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.
LASER
That's it?
PAUL
It was worth more back then.
You
know. With inflation...
(off Laser's look)
Hey, I'm glad I did it...
Laser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism.
He looks over at
him, then away.
PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY

Paul watches Jules work in his backyard.
Luis hauls shrubs.
64

Sweating and dirty, Joni and Paul pull radishes from the
ground. They're in a zone together. Paul takes off his sun-
hat and put it on Joni's head.
PAUL
You got your mom's fair skin.
You
didn't get my Mediterranean
genes...
JONI
Thanks...
Joni's cell rings.
She looks.
Rolls her eyes.
JONI (CONT'D)
Ugh.
Ignore.
Joni hits the ignore button, puts her cell away.
PAUL
Who's that?
54.
JONI
My mom, Nic. She's making me
insane.
PAUL
Why?
What's she doing?
JONI
She's treating me like I'm 12.
It's like she doesn't want to admit
I'm an adult.
PAUL
She's your mom.
That's her job.
JONI
What? To smother me to death?
That's not her job.
PAUL
Well, if you want things to be
different, you've got to make that
happen. That's your job.
65
65
Laser walks with Clay. Clay sports a homemade arm-cast for
the skateboard mishap we witnessed earlier.
CLAY
That jump was cake, dude!
I so
could've made it.
LASER
You were like 20 feet short, dude!
There was no way.
CLAY
Yeah, well if Paul wasn't there I
could have landed it. That guy
creeps me out.
LASER
Whatever.
CLAY
He's kind of a fag, dude. Tryin'
to act all like your dad and shit.
Laser doesn't know how to respond so he ignores the comment.
A stray DOG comes up to them. Laser stops to pet it.
55.
LASER
Hey buddy.
Good boy.
Laser sees the dog has no tags. He looks around for an
owner. The dog nuzzles Laser for affection.
LASER (CONT'D)
I've seen this dog around.
I
wonder if he's lost.
CLAY
Let's pee on his head.
LASER
What?
Clay unzips his fly.
It's difficult with the plaster cast.
LASER (CONT'D)
Dude, don't do that.
CLAY
Come on.
Hold him...
Clay yanks the dog by his scruff.
LASER
Dude, Quit it!
CLAY
(mocking)
Duuude, quit it!
Suddenly, Laser gets it. His friend is the tool.
He grabs
the dog and smacks him to get him to run away.
LASER
Go!
Run!
Get out of here!
The dog TAKES OFF.
Clay shoves Laser.
CLAY
Why are you such a fag?!
Laser shoves Clay back hard.
LASER
Why are you such a dick?!
Clay HITS Laser in the mouth. Laser touches his lip.
Sees
blood, and walks away. Friendship over.
56.
66

Paul and Joni walk to his motorcycle parked in the dirt lot
behind them. Paul grabs his helmet off the bike, hands it to
Joni.
PAUL
Here, put this on.
Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the
buckle for her. They get on the bike and take off down the
hill.
67
67
Paul takes Joni home on his motorcycle via Sunset Boulevard.
She holds Paul tightly.
69

Paul and Joni climb off the bike. Nic storms out of the
house to intercept them by the sidewalk.
NIC
Funny how someone conveniently
forgot to tell me they were driving
home on a motorcycle!
JONI
Mom...
57.
NIC
You know how many people I've seen
come into the hospital paralyzed
from motorcycle accidents?!
PAUL
I'm a very safe rider...
NIC
That is so not the point I'm
making! Joni knows this is
something I'd never allow.
JONI
Mom, I'm 18 years old! I won't
even be living here in like next
month!
NIC
Yeah, well, you're living here now!
JONI
Yeah, well why don't you get a jump
on it and pretend like I'm not!
Joni storms off.
Nic glowers at Paul.
NIC
She's never talked to me like that.
PAUL
(trying to soften it)
You know, Nic. If you eased up on
the restrictions, maybe there'd be
less tension...
NIC
(marinated in sarcasm)
Really? You think so, Paul?
Is
that how it works?
Jules walks up to intervene.
JULES
What's going on?
NIC
Oh, nothing. Paul's just giving me
child-rearing lessons.
PAUL
I was just saying--
58.
NIC
Listen, when you've been a parent
for 18 years, come talk to me!
PAUL
I was just making an observation.
NIC
Yeah, and I need your observations
like I need a dick in my ass!
Nic storms off.
Jules follows.
Paul watches, shell shocked.

Jules runs out to meet Luis, waiting patiently at the door.
61.
JULES
What's up?
LUIS
Where do you want the stones?
JULES
(catching her breath)
The stones? Over by the fence.
Luis stares at his employer. She looks totally disheveled.
Jules starts feeling her hair, smoothing it into shape.
JULES (CONT'D)
(defensive)
What? I was using the bathroom.
(then)
Do you need to use the bathroom?
Luis stares at her feet.
She looks down.
She's barefoot.
77

Paul and Laser shoot hoop. There's a tense-ness to their
patter. Laser takes the ball and steps to the top of the key
and shoots. Drains it.
LASER
That's H.
PAUL
I know.
Laser steps up to left side of the basket, calls his shot.
LASER
Lay-up.
PAUL
Hey, don't take it easy on me cause
you're winning--
Laser does a trick behind the back lay-up.
Nails it.
Then
tosses the ball to Paul.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Nobody likes a show-off.
LASER
Hey, can I ask you a question?
62.
PAUL
Oh god.
Okay. Hit me.
LASER
When you die do you want to be
buried or cremated?
PAUL
That's your question?
LASER
I want to be cremated.
PAUL
I think I'd rather be buried.
LASER
Why? That's just taking up more
space in the earth.
PAUL
I don't know, something about the
idea of being burned into this
chalky powder and sprinkled--
LASER
What do you care?
You won't even
be conscious.
PAUL
That's true. I guess I just want
to be in a place where people can
visit me.
LASER
(growing animated)
But why?! You'll be dead! You
won't even know they're there!

The family sits in silence, having breakfast.
Nic looks
around the table, feeling like a pariah.
NIC
Look, I know you've all been
enjoying your time with Paul. And
I know I haven't been as open to
him as everyone else and this has
caused some...friction...between
us. But I'd like to try and change
that...
Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted.
"And...?"
NIC (CONT'D)
So I was thinking. Maybe it would
be nice if we all had dinner at his
house sometime. That way, I could
get to know him a little better,
and I could see all the good work
mom's been doing with his backyard.
Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods.
They
recognize this is a big step for Nic.

Paul walks out to check on Jules. She's sweating her ass
off, shlepping stacks of heavy mulch across the yard.
PAUL
How's it going?
JULES
Okay...
72.
PAUL
Here, let me help.
Paul takes some of her load and together they transport the
sod to the other side of the yard. Neither know what to say.
Paul stares at her, waiting for her lead.
JULES
We can't be doing this...
PAUL
I know...
JULES
I'm married...
PAUL
...and the kids...
JULES
Yeah, and I love Nic.
PAUL
I know...
They stare at each other and we cut to...

The family packs into the Volvo to head to Paul's.

Paul's walking through rows of swiss chard, cell phone to his
ear.
Conversation Intercut.
PAUL
Hey Joni, how you doing?
JONI
You're such a phony.
Beat.
PAUL
Excuse me?
JONI
You act like you're so groovy and
together but you're not. You're a
shitty person!
PAUL
What happened?
JONI
With my mom?!
PAUL
Listen, can I just come and talk
with you--
JONI
What's wrong with you?!
PAUL
Joni...
JONI
Don't call me anymore.
Joni hangs up and start crying.
Sasha hugs her.
106
106
Sweaty, nauseous with remorse, Paul turns around to find
fetching young Brooke, waiting for him with a wicker basket
of huge cucumbers.
BROOKE
Hey Paul, look at these cukes...
86.
Paul holds up his hand at her.
This girl symbolizes every
bad choice he's ever made.
He gives her the universal, "Leave Me Alone" gesture.
Brooke
looks embarrassed.
107

Jules sits on a lawn chair smoking a cigarette.
Her cell
rings. She answers.
108
108
Paul walks down the street, wigging out.
PAUL
Hey, it's me. I just talked to
Joni.
Conversation intercut.
JULES
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
I should
have called you.
Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette.
PAUL
What happened?
JULES
Nic saw my hair in your bathroom.
PAUL
The other night.
JULES
Yeah.
PAUL
Fuck...
JULES
Yeah.
Beat.
PAUL
Listen, it's all out in the open
now. Let's make this happen.
87.
JULES
Paul...
PAUL
No, I'm serious. Fuck it. Let's get
the kids together and do this
thing.
JULES
Paul, come on...
PAUL
No! I'm sick of this life. I want
a family. I'm ready--
JULES
(eye rolling)
Jesus, Paul! I'm gay!
Jules tosses the phone away from her.

Joni and Sasha stand at the makeshift "bar".
Joni's downs
several Tequila shots quickly.
SASHA
Slow down, tiger.
Across the room, Joni spots Jai chatting with a WAIFY GIRL in
a sundress.
Joni drops one more Tequila shot and walks up to Jai and
Waify girl, interrupting them.
JONI
I like the scruff.
It's sexy.
Waify girl juts out her hip territorially.
WAIFY GIRL
Uh, `scuuuse me...
JONI
You're excused.
(then back to Jai)
Hey, can I talk to you?
Joni leads Jai to a private corner.
88.
She leans in and kisses Jai. And Jai actually returns the
kiss. And it's completely sweet and intimate.
But then the kiss starts to morph as Joni's energy turns
manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy. We see
Jai start to pull away. But Joni keeps holding him, wanting
more. Finally, Jai breaks off the kiss.
JAI
Joni...Joni...
JONI
What?
Joni looks pained, embarrassed.
Jai keeps holding her hands.
JAI
Are you okay?
JONI
Yeah, I'm fine...
Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her
wake.

The sun rises on this formerly happy home.

Paul looks around his newly landscaped yard.
It looks more
abandoned than revived.
117
117
Joni walks out for privacy, closes the door behind her.
JONI
So like, everything that happened
between us. What was that? Was
that just bullshit?!
PAUL
No, it wasn't bullshit at all. I
know I don't seem credible right
now but I really care about you...
Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check.
PAUL (CONT'D)
...and I just hope someday we'll be
able to see each other again. Do
you think that could maybe happen?
JONI
I don't know...
Joni looks down welling up.
JONI (CONT'D)
I just wish you could've been...
PAUL
What?
Joni chokes back tears.
JONI
Better...
Paul and Joni look up at each other when the door suddenly
flings open. Nic is there, fuming.
93.
NIC
You've got some balls, mister!
PAUL
Nic, hold on...
Nic walks toward he and Joni.
Joni ducks back inside.
NIC
No, you hold on! Let me tell you
something, you really hurt my kids!
PAUL
Well, they're kinda my...
NIC
(cutting him off)
No! They're not. This is not your
family. This is my family! You're
just a fucking interloper...
Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand.
PAUL
I didn't mean to hurt anyone...
Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace.
NIC
If you want a family so much, go
out and make one of your own!
Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her.
Paul stand alone, spinning. After a moment he spontaneously
looks back into the house. Laser is staring at him through
the window. Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite
smile. That's the final straw for Laser. He grabs his plate
and walks out of view.
Reeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle. He gets on the bike,
helmet in hand. Turns on the ignition. He picks up the
helmet and pauses, shaking in the hell of his own making.
Losing it, he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle.
121

Nic and Jules stuff the last of Joni's things in the back of
their station wagon. Laser and Joni bring the last of the
boxes out of the house.
124
124
The station wagon passes through the campus.
126
126
The Allgoods pull up to the curb, get out.
Laser piles
Joni's boxes on his skateboard.
127

Laser dollies Joni's boxes though the corridor and while Joni
and the moms follow behind.
129

Joni exits, looking around to find her family. The station
wagon is gone. She looks panicked. Her pace quickens as she
makes her way down a hill toward the road.
Finally Joni sees the Volvo heading towards her.
The car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out.
Joni
looks vulnerable. She tries to cover it.
JONI
Where'd you go?!
NIC
We had to move the car.
JONI
I thought you left.
JULES
We wouldn't leave without saying
goodbye.
NIC
Give us some credit.
And suddenly, everyone realizes...this is it. It's time to
say goodbye. First Laser comes up and hugs Joni.
LASER
It's gonna be weird not having you
at home.
JONI
Sorry to leave you alone with them.
LASER
It's okay.
I can handle it.
Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni,
tears streaming down their faces.
97.
JONI
Guys, come on...
(beat)
Look, I'll talk to you soon.
Joni tries to detach from the hug. But her moms won't let
go. They keep holding her and crying.
Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down.
Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up,
unbidden, overpowering her. She starts crying.
The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder.
Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure,
resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her.
Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go.
They hold her
tight to comfort her.
They keep holding her until a calm sets in.
The hug breaks apart. Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face.
Joni gives her moms one last smile.
Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands
watching as they drive off and her new life begins.
