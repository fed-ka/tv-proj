                  (continuing)
            ... a pastoral world, which also
            shows evidence of learning and
              civilization. My first officer
            has taken an away team down to
            make contact and they are in the
              process of returning to the ship.

5  COMMAND AND HELM AREAS

    Picard looking to Troi.

                      PICARD
            Riker has sounded very enthused
            in his reports.

                      TROI
                  (nods)
            He says the planet has life forms
              almost identical to us.

    Interrupted by Beverly who ENTERS, obviously with much
  on her mind.

                      BEVERLY
              Captain... !
                  (sees she has
                 interrupted)
              Sorry, Troi.

    Troi smiles, beckons Beverly in.

                      TROI
            The Doctor has something much more
              important on her mind, Captain.

                      BEVERLY
                  (frowns; to Troi)
              Please, Troi, do not pick up my
              feelings!

                      TROI
            Your feelings? All we need
            are ears.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - TEASER           3.

                      PICARD
                  (smiles to Beverly)
              You've been talking about it for
            days now... Shore leave for the
            crew.

    Beverly sees that her son Wesley has also thrown her
  a concerned look. She gives an apologetic nod to Troi.

                      BEVERLY
            I'm tired myself.
                  (to Picard)
              Establishing that colony has
              exhausted the entire crew, sir.
            We're not a supply vessel.
              Settling all those people was a
              strain on everyone.

    RIKER interrupts by ENTERING with DATA, GEORDI, TASHA.
    They all register enthusiasm, giving the replacement
    crew nods, smiles, thumbs up gestures as they take over
    their positions. Riker has continued straight to
    Picard, acknowledging Troi and Beverly too.

                      PICARD
            Is it as good as your reports,
              Number One?

                      RIKER
                  (enthused)
              Exactly per my reports, sir.
            Class M, so Earthlike, so
              beautiful, it will startle you!

                      BEVERLY
            It sounds wonderful for the
              children!
                  (to Picard)
            The Holodecks are marvelous, of
              course, but nothing like giving
            them open space and fresh air...

    Beverly takes a simulated deep breath of air.

                      TASHA
            I've listed my report on their
              customs and laws, sir. Fairly
              simple, common sense things.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - TEASER           4.

            Wild in some ways, puritanical
            in others. Neat as pins,
              ultra-lawful, and making love at
            the drop of a hat.

                      TASHA
            Any hat.

                      PICARD
                  (smile)
            But even the happiest report has
            its negatives. Let's start with
            them.

                      RIKER
                  (grins)
            There are none, sir. Not that
            any of us can find.

                      DATA
            But there is a problem here, sir!

    Data is puzzling over readings at his station.

                      DATA
                  (continuing)
            I do not understand this at all!

                      WORF
                  (to Picard)
            It's the faulty reading I
              reported, sir.

                      TASHA
              Sensor technicians are working
            on it, sir. They've identified
            it as a "glitch" in the system.

    Picard turns back to Riker.

                      PICARD
            I take it you find no "glitch"
            at all in this planet, however.

                      TASHA
            If you approve shore leave, sir,
            we could start with a small group
            at first.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - TEASER           5.

                      PICARD
            Of course...
                  (turns)
              Wesley, if we go, you will join
            the away team to evaluate this
            world as a place for young people
            to relax.

                      WESLEY
            Yes, sir!

  He glances at Beverly to note her smiling approval of
    this.

                      PICARD
            If all scans and observations
              confirm the reports...
                  (nods)
            ... certainly I'll approve it.
                  (beat)
            Let's hope it is not too good
            to be true.

  The kind of place you'd like to visit. No particularly

  of revealing but sensible garb here too -- along with
    good humor. In fact, joy is what is mainly present
    here. Lots of fruit, nuts, food and drink selections.
  A MUSIC GROUP of Harpists in sight -- admittedly
    strange looking harps on which they compose, and now
  and then PLAY LILTING MUSIC which, like everything else,
  is not taken too seriously here either.

  as Data ENTERS bridge from the turbolift, strides
    rapidly toward his station, his face reflecting concern.

                      DATA
            I have traced it through all sensor
              channels, Captain! It is not a
              glitch... !

    Picard becomes alarmed at Data's tone, follows him to
  the Ops station where Data begins going over readings
    again.

                      DATA
                  (continuing)
            ... or any other form of error or
              malfunction, sir.

                      GEORDI
              Confirmed by my readings, sir.
            It's like a "shadow something"...

                      DATA
              Exactly! As if it's not entirely
            in or out of our dimension.

                      PICARD
              "What" is, Commander?

    Data points off to front starboard of the vessel.

                      DATA
              Whatever is sitting out there
              without triggering our alarm
              relays, Captain.

                      PICARD
              Center Main Viewer on that area.

            I need more, Commander.

    Data seems stumped for a moment, then:

                      DATA
              Permission to go to hailing
              frequencies, sir?

              identify yourself!

  As suddenly, the "what" begins appearing -- A HUGE AND
    COMPLEX LOOKING OBJECT, A BIT SMALLER THAN THE
    ENTERPRISE. IT IS HALF-TRANSPARENT BUT PARTLY SOLID,
    TOO, AND VERY DEADLY LOOKING. A VESSEL? PERHAPS, BUT
    SEEMINGLY MORE, TOO. WE WILL LEARN THAT IT SOMEHOW
    EXISTS HERE AND IN ANOTHER CONTINUUM AT THE SAME TIME.
  At the moment it appears, the Enterprise RED ALERT with
    KLAXON comes on too.

  The Red Alert lights FLASHING, the KLAXON SOUNDING a
    couple more times, then going SILENT. The mystery
    object IMAGE is on the Main Viewer; Picard and the
    others are as we last saw them.

                      GEORDI
              Shields and deflectors up full,

                      TASHA
            Sir, my sensors read it... well,
            as "half there." And it does
              look...

  It is rather frightening to see Data turn to his
    Captain... slowly shake his head.


    Geordi ENTERING on a run, racing to the first large
    port, from which the mystery object/vessel thing can
  be seen from here too. He stands examining it. Then:

    Picard intent upon:

                        GEORDI'S COM VOICE
            It's as if it isn't entirely in
            our dimension, sir.

            No, sir. Perhaps it is meant to

    Conn is very puzzled over a reading at his station.

                      CONN CREWMEMBER
              Intruder relays do show
              something...

  He hesitates, puzzled.

                      PICARD
            Why has everything become a
              something, or a whatever?

  He gets his answer as the tiny SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT
    COMES INTO VIEW. It is about the size of a 'light bulb'
    now, moving more slowly than before. COMING IN ON AN
    UPWARD ANGLE THROUGH THE DECK, IT STOPS NOW, SUSPENDED
  IN THE MID-BRIDGE AREA.

24 ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA (OPTICAL)

    Picard has come to his feet, watching as the TINY
    SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT which moves in his direction, and
    STOPS. Picard has tried not to retreat before the
    mysterious thing, but it is with some difficulty. Conn
  has moved in holding a large hand phaser ready, but
  has gotten a headshake from Picard. Then, from the tiny
    swirling light object, a VOICE we'll come to know as
  the EDOLORD. THE WORDS ARE TRANSMITTED WITH SUCH VOLUME
    THAT THEY LITERALLY SHAKE THE BRIDGE (OPTICAL OR CAMERA
    JIGGLE). A couple of the bridge crew throw hands to
    ears protectively. At the same time, we HEAR SOUND OF
    SOMETHING SHATTERING "GLASSLIKE" AS IT COMES APART,
    various PANELS FLARE WITH LIGHT.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO          18.

    volume level.

    Picard fighting to stay calm. As he realizes he has
    heard the entire message:

            this Federation starship...

            We found that world uninhabited.

27 ANGLE ON DATA (OPTICAL)

    genuinely puzzled over Picard's last statement.
    Suddenly the TINY LIGHT SWIRL RISES TOWARD DATA, comes
  to rest floating inches in front of his face. Then,
    Data registers a surprised expression now as he
    continues looking at the SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT. Then:

                      DATA
              Captain... I do not understand how,
            but it is asking me if I was...

            If there... is any way of our
              learning more about whatever is
            out there, Data...

    Data starts to nod, a movement which triggers action
  -- the tiny LIGHT SWIRL moving in to touch Data's
    forehead -- resulting in Data going down to the deck
  with a crash.

28 ANGLE DOWN ON DATA (OPTICAL)

  His entire form GLOWING as he goes stiff, eyes rolling
    back in their sockets.


    Riker in the midst of reacting to something Worf has
    just said. With him the balance of the away team is
    mixing happily with various of the Edo.

                  (waits, then again)
              Captain, do you read me?

  He gets nothing in return. Troubled, he turns to Worf,
    speaking quietly:

                      RIKER
                  (continuing)
              Let's... it may be nothing, but
            let's move our people together.

                      TROI
            Is there some problem?

    Troi has somehow sensed Riker's feelings and made her
  way toward them now.

                      RIKER
            We've lost contact with our ship.

                      TROI
                  (scans room)
            It's nothing these people have
              done... I'm certain of that. Their
            minds are so open...

                      RIKER
            Help me locate Wes. He's wandered
              somewhere.

  He LEADS Troi toward the entrance as Worf eases his way
    toward the rest of the Away Team.

  Not wanting to create a false emergency, he works his
  way toward Tasha carefully. She's with Rivan, Liator
  and other Edo.

                      WORF
            If I can take a moment of your
            time, Lieutenant...

                      TASHA
            Yes, Worf... but you've got to hear
            this.
                  (to Liator)
            Are you telling me that there's
            no crime here whatsoever? No one
              breaks any laws?

                      LIATOR
                  (smiles)
            Once they did. Long, long ago
            there was much disorder.

            But I've seen no sign of... of
              police... those who enforce laws.

                      RIVAN
            We have very few. They're called
              "Mediators." And they are needed
            only in one place each day...

                      LIATOR
            The "punishment zone." An area
              that's selected for a period of
            time.

                      TASHA
            It's a completely random selection?

                      LIATOR
                  (nods)
            No one but our Mediators know what
            place or for how long. We're very
            proud of the wisdom of our
              ancestors. No person ever knows
            where or when a zone will be.

                      RIVAN
                  (smiling too)
            ... and so no one risks death.

              Death?

            Wait, let's explain this...

                      LIATOR
                  (nodding, pleased)
            Only one punishment for any
              crime.

                      WORF
              Anyone who commits any crime in

            The law is the law. Our peace
            is built on that.

                      TASHA
            Even a small thing? Such as
              ignoring a rule like "keep off
            the grass?"

                      RIVAN
                  (nods; happily)
            Then no one breaks that rule.
            Who wants to risk execution?
              There's always a white wall or
            fence to remind anyone of a
              forbidden area like that...

    Tasha begins EXITING calling a question back to the
    Edo.

                      TASHA
            And just who tells visitors of
            those rules?

    Both anxious.

            is over there. At least, I hope
              that's it.

            We will record him as a convicted-criminal

                  (then sarcasm)
            ... an "advanced" person who
              luckily escaped the barbarism of
            this backward little world.

    Picard reacts uncomfortably to this.

                      PICARD
              Unfortunately, we have a law
              ourselves known as the Prime
              Directive...

                      RIVAN
                  (nods)
            Riker has explained it to us...

                      PICARD
            Is the boy in the slightest danger
            from you right now?

                      RIVAN
                  (nods; to Picard)
              Because you are strangers, we are
              delaying enforcement of the law.
            But we must act by the time of
              sundown.

                      PICARD
            Then, I have another question now,
              please. While orbiting... while
              circling high above your world
            as we do... we encountered a
              strange object, a "vessel"
              perhaps? Do you know of such a
              thing? It was... well, you could
            say not entirely real, at least
            not completely what you might call
              solid...

                      RIVAN
            Do you mean God?

                      PICARD
            God?

                      LIATOR
            God is said to be somewhere up
              there. Protecting us.

  A long beat during which the Enterprise people exchange
    looks, uncertain what this could mean.

                      PICARD
              Exactly... exactly how would you
              describe "God?"

                      RIVAN
                  (indicating Picard)
            As you just did. As existing
            both here and in another place
            also.

                      LIATOR
            But when God wants to show its
              power, it can make itself felt
            most fully.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT FOUR          38.

    Troi has made a signal to Picard, mouths the word

            Stand by; Picard out.
                  (to Troi)

    Picard, Troi and Rivan ENTER SCENE coming down the
    corridor. Rivan is astonished by what she is seeing.
  She looks from Troi to a couple of very efficient
    appearing crewmembers who are passing.

                      RIVAN
            But this is a ... a city. A great
            city!

    Now, Beverly ENTERS SCENE also, her expression freezing
  as she sees Picard and bears down upon him.

                      BEVERLY

              Exactly, Doctor, in a moment.
                  (to Rivan; more gently)
            You were about to say... ?

    Rivan gives Beverly a puzzled glance, then turns her
    attention to Picard, indicating the vessel.

                      RIVAN
            Since you have all this power,
            why be concerned about our laws?
            You could take the boy from us!

                      PICARD
                  (troubled smile)
            It's not that simple.

    Beverly gives a quick look at Rivan and Picard at this,
    beginning to understand at least something of what may
  be happening. With so much of her own at stake, it is
  all Beverly can do to keep from interrupting again, but
    Picard's firm expression detains her. Picard, Beverly,
  and Troi lead Rivan into a turbolift. Troi gives a
    troubled look toward Rivan.


  as Picard, Troi and Rivan ENTER from turbolift.

                      TROI
            From here we can view whatever's
              outside our vessel.

                      RIVAN

              circling your world too. It's
            very important to us... perhaps
            to you... to know what it is.

    Rivan is puzzled.

56   ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

    REVEALING THE MYSTERY VESSEL/OBJECT out beyond what WE
  CAN SEE of the Enterprise. CAMERA PANS to Rivan,
    Picard, Troi, and Beverly. At the instant Rivan sees
  it, she drops to one knee, clenching her eyes closed,
  with hands crossed over her chest.

                      PICARD
            I'm sorry, Rivan, but this was
              necessary. Do you know what that
            is?

    Rivan nods jerkily, her eyes still clenched closed.

                      TROI
                  (waits; then gently)
            Can you tell us what it is?

    Rivan stays frozen in the same position. Picard now
    waits, then:

                      PICARD
            Is it "God?"

    Rivan again nods jerkily, eyes still clenched.

                      PICARD
                  (continuing)
            Now, it's very important you
              answer something. How do you
              recognize what it is?

    Troi is pointing agitatedly to where the mysterious
    object/vessel is GLOWING BRIGHTER, and the bridge
    begins to shake as WE HEAR THE IMMENSE VOLUME OF THE
    VOICE WE HEARD EARLIER IN THE BRIDGE.

              "Return... ?"

    Picard's eye falls on the trembling Rivan and he
    suddenly understands. The moment interrupted by the
    Enterprise beginning to SHUDDER and the LIGHTS BLINK
    OFF, EMPHASIZING THE NOW BRIGHTLY GLOWING EDOLORD
    OBJECT/VESSEL.

                      TROI
            It's coming toward us, sir... !

  And this is exactly what is happening. THE EDOLORD
    OBJECT/VESSEL IS MOVING TOWARD THE ENTERPRISE ON A
    COLLISION COURSE. The Enterprise is SHAKING heavily
    now, WE CAN HEAR STRUCTURAL STRAIN.

    Picard understands what to do, takes off his insignia,

              certainly none that any sane and
              reasonable person would...

    Beverly's words have come faster, louder, until she
    finally realizes she is giving way emotionally. She
    stops, controls herself with an effort we can see.

                  (continuing)
            I... apologize, sir... but this is

                      PICARD
            You saw what that thing was about
            to do. I have a ship, an entire
            crew to consider...

                      BEVERLY
            If you felt the same, you'd be

                  (quietly)
            But I am.

    They face each other silently. Then she nods.

            Data is in Sickbay here. You'll
            find him able to talk.


    Data is conscious, being scanned on Sickbay equipment by
  a MEDICAL TECHNICIAN. As Beverly and Picard ENTER, the
    Technician pauses in what he is doing.

                      MEDICAL TECHNICIAN
            He's checking out fine, Doctor.

            It is perhaps not what we'd

            The dimensions this one occupies
              allows them to... well, to be in
              several places at once. But they
              consider this entire star cluster

            I doubt they expect us to abide
            by their value systems.

                      DATA
            They know everything I know, sir.

                      PICARD
            And, in your opinion, if we
              violated the Prime Directive.. ?

                 it)
              That's not a fair question at...

    Beverly bites off her words. But it is all she can do
  to keep from saying more.

                      PICARD
                  (to Data)
              Continue.

                      DATA
            That would be a case of judging
            us by our own rules, sir. If we
              violate our own Prime Directive,
            they might consider us deceitful
            and untrustworthy.

            You do recall, sir, they cautioned
            us not to interfere with their

    considerable interest. He turns to Picard.

            You were right, sir. I do tend

            ... but it is quite another to be
              silently observed by it. I am
              concerned whether it understands
            the same concept of reason that
            we do?

    Picard ponders all this for a moment more until Data
    ENTERS. Picard beckons.

                      DATA
            You sent for me, sir?

                      PICARD
            Let's talk some more, Data.

                      DATA
            Yes sir. What level of
              communication?

    Picard gives him an annoyed look.

                      PICARD
            Any. My apologies for saying you

            It was wise to beam back the Edo

            The Edo's "God" is very protective
            of its children.

                      PICARD
            There was no choice but to
              learn...

                      DATA
              Apparently the Edo people had seen
            it before, from time to time, sir.

                      PICARD
                  (nods)
            But I'm sorry I had to. She was
            so frightened.

                  (nods)
                Understandable. To share an orbit
            with "God" is no small experience.

    Picard looks at Data, smiles.

                      PICARD
            You have a facility for seeing
              things not in the way we do, but
            as they truly are.

    Picard shifts in his seat closer to Data, addresses him
  eye to eye.         STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT FIVE              51.

            I need help, my friend. I cannot
            let Wesley or any member of this
              vessel be sacrificed this way.
            The Prime Directive does not
              really intend that.

                      DATA
            The problem, sir, is there!
                  (indicates mystery
                 object)
              Although they have learned of the
            Prime Directive from my mind, how
            will they evaluate it? How do
            they reason? What are their
              values? Remember its warning
            to us, sir.

                      PICARD
              Exactly. How do I explain not
              obeying the laws down there, not
              permitting young Crusher's
              execution? Does that endanger
            this ship and over a thousand
            other lives?

                      DATA
            Would you choose one life over
            one thousand, sir?

                      PICARD
                  (snaps)
            I refuse to let arithmetic decide
              questions like that!

    Picard examines Data's expression again. Then, he
    indicates out toward the mysterious object/vessel again.

                      PICARD
            Did you learn anything of the
              relationship between the Edo and
            that? Why are they so certain
            it is "God?"

                      DATA

                  (looks out toward the
                 Object)
            But when they were probing my
              thoughts, Captain, I could feel
            that whatever they are now, they
            once existed in this dimension,
            just as we do. Perhaps also in
            the same kind of "flesh and blood"
            form. Since then, however, they
            have evolved considerably further.
            Their present existence in mixed
              dimensions no doubt has advantages
            we do not understand...

                      PICARD
            Then, in their earlier flesh and
            blood existence they could have
            once shared our kind of values.

            The Edo share them, sir.

                      PICARD
            Why would advanced things like
            that feel obliged to protect the
            Edo?

                      DATA
              Perhaps because the Edo are a
              child-race by comparison.
              Possibly a race which the life
            forms over there "planted" here
            much as we now plant human
              colonies on Class-M planets.

    Beverly turns to Picard -- she wants to fall crying at
  his feet, or embrace him, cover him with kisses of

  what Riker wants. Rivan and Liator obviously understand
    this -- and perhaps do not really oppose it.       STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT FIVE              54.

    Reaching Picard, she drops worshipfully to one knee,
    crossing her hands across her chest, eyes closed as when
  she saw the mystery/vessel object. She hands Picard
  his insignia.

                 Edo, eyes still
                 clenched)
            And the boy too.

  The Edo there shuffle nervously, uncertainly. They have
    always appeared to be a calm, intelligent life form,
    never seeming overly superstitious, but should they
    reject this possibility? Beverly turns to Picard
    hopefully; is this an answer to the dilemma? Then
    Picard bends, lifts Rivan up by her elbows.

            No, no, we're not "Gods."

            be better than many we once had.
                  (points at Picard)

                      SECOND MEDIATOR
            God will destroy you!

                      PICARD
                  (back to Liator)
            ... no justice so long as laws are
              absolute. Life itself is an
              exercise in exceptions.

                      RIKER
                  (quietly)
              Bravo. When has justice ever been
            as simple as a rulebook, sir?
                  (looks around)
            Six to beam up, Captain?

                  (screams it)
            God will punish you!

  And with this ringing in their ears, they BEAM OUT.

    others. The balance of our regulars are on duty there
    too.

            Main Viewer on!

    They slowly take their positions, eyes on the Viewer.
  As Wesley ENTERS with Beverly, Geordi looks up.

                      GEORDI
              Greetings, Jailbird.

  It doesn't get a big laugh at this moment.

                      PICARD
              Hailing frequencies open.

                      TASHA
            Open, sir.

                      PICARD
            To the object sharing this
              orbit... we will remove the human
              colonists from the adjoining solar
              system if signaled to do so. Or
            we'll proceed on our mission, if
              signaled to do that. Please tell
            us...

            Is that a signal?

                      PICARD
                  (beat)
            I was hoping for more.

                      GEORDI
            More of what, sir? I'm happy it's
            gone.

                      RIKER
                  (nods)
            We're all thrilled with that, sir.

                      PICARD
                  (beat)
            I was hoping we'd learn more about
            it. But since we can't...
                  (looks to Riker)
            Take us out of here, Number One.

                      RIKER
              Gladly, sir.
