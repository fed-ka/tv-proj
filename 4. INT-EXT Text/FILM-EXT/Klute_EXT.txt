Tree lined area, lush and green - Summer.
Verdant Pennsylvania farmland. Early morning. Near
at hand an open field set about with bee hutches
and patched with mist.
A FIGURE, a shadow (Klute's actually) moves across
frame from the left, blanking in. We reorient to -
Klute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the
house door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage
Plymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then
takes a last turn around the yard itself; props
open the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the
rail gate of a sidefield. He approaches to roll
shut his barn door -- and on this action we CUT
again TO --
They trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the
late-afternoon crush. A LONG-LENS shot, the crowd
compacted. We see BREE milling along with the rest.
She maneuvers to a sidewalk PHONE BOOTH, enters. We
see her deposit, dial.
Klute finishes rolling shut, and padlocks, the barn
door. He returns to his car, sits in (leaving door
open) starts engine. Again -- one last time -- the
look around. Then he pulls the door shut, pulls
out. And on this we CUT TO --
Klute's car draws through the business section of
town, moves on --
HILLY COUNTRY - DAY
KLUTE'S CAR
As Klute's car drives onto the turnpike surrounded
by green country, we ZOOM into a close shot of
Klute through the windshield of his car. And then
in what seems like a continuous shot we ZOOM back
to a wide angle revealing Klute caught in the
endless line of cars in a typical traffic jam at
the entrance to New York City, surrounded by
smoggy, grey, urban skies.
BREE moves along street, returning home,
apprehensive of the one or two other distant
FIGURES. She turns in at one of the Brownstones.
Klute walks, as before, carrying his suitcase. We
see him slow, concernedly looking toward --
Klute comes out door and descends the stairs at the
same even pace -- he walks into the vacant store
below.
Bree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans
quickly out in one direction then the other (in
case Klute has been waiting in ambush on the
sidewalk) then races -- PAN -- to BUS AT CURB --
makes it, pulls herself aboard --
BREE comes out, pauses with notebook to cross out,
the call completed, checks the list of those
remaining, sets forth again. We hear TRASK'S VOICE
OVER, very quick, very clipped.
TRASK (V.O.)
Man, just a poor pretty little
hooker, like to be an actress --
Camera is looking up through lighted window outside
at BREE on phone.
BREE
Oh hon, I just don't know. I'm
trying to stay out of it.
CAMERA pans down from BREE's window to KLUTE's
window at the bottom revealing KLUTE at tape
recorder. The TAPE RECORDER is going, its light
winking. KLUTE holds headset against one ear, makes
a note or two. We hear BREE's and other GIRL'S
VOICES, UNDER, FILTERED.
GIRL'S VOICE
-- comes in with these other yulds
maybe two or three times a year,
and five big ones baby, just one
evening.
BREE VOICE
Marta, thanks, and I'd love to
party with you hon, but --
Klute sets down the headset (we drop the VOICES far
under, INDISTINGUISHABLE), makes a note, and thumbs
open the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is
near the end. We establish a pile of ALREADY
RECORDED TAPES. We CUT BACK TO --
Bree comes out from the building (note possible
costume change; not necessarily consecutive
action), checks off on her list continues on her
way -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES.
Starting with a CLICK and --
BREE VOICE
Bree Daniel.
2ND MAN'S VOICE
(nicely)
Bree -- Frank Hanley, you remember,
Fayetterville?
BREE VOICE
Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure.
2ND MAN'S VOICE
Well I'm in town, like to see you.
BREE VOICE
Well Frank that's awful nice but
I'm out of action, sort of, you
know --
We FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD,
CONTINUING, as --
BREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE,
at corner, unseen by her and apparently in
surveillance of her. Then he too turns out of
frame, and we CUT TO --
SPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench
eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper
and sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviously
a man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him.
Across from them some prisoners are taking their
exercise. Through the metallic netting that
surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York
City. It only dramatizes more the sense of being
caged.
SPANGLER
-- Usual case history -- this isn't
a medical confidence, it's all of
them -- broken family, lonely,
confused, crummy childhood, early
promiscuity, formal prostitution
beginning in her teens, income
twenty-five to thirty thousand a
year.
(notes Klute's reaction)
Oh they don't keep the money: they
get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?
(stabs at record)
Why do you want to know all this?
KLUTE
I want to know how Tom Grunemann
got mixed up in it.
SPANGLER
Not unusual.
KLUTE
Did she talk about him to you?
SPANGLER
About his letters -- that's all she
remembered. Quite violent material,
I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick
man. But that's not unusual either.
KLUTE
Has she talked with you since
prison?
SPANGLER
No. She had every good intention of
it -- coming to me as a private
patient, getting out of the life,
devoting herself to an acting
career.
KLUTE
I think she's trying that.
SPANGLER
Oh sure they try. The idea of a
better life.
But they don't really
know much about life: They get
confused -- or scared or frustrated
or bored -- they pop back to the
one thing they can handle.
The trick. The trick. Men in bed.
Not men in general, not life, not
love, not even real sex -- it
avoids all that. Just the trick,
the transaction.
Large, dark buildings -- a DIM-LIGHTED WINDOW
showing at an upper floor of one -- the street
otherwise by and large deserted. A TAXI draws in, a
FIGURE IN EVENING DRESS (Bree) gets out, approaches
the building, glances around, either secretly or
apprehensively -- presses a buzzer, waits, gets
answering CLICKS, enters the dark hallway of the
building, starts upstairs.
KLUTE shifts into view, looking in the direction
Bree's gone, a little puzzled all in all. He
doesn't immediately follow; he waits.
KLUTE arrives from across the street. It takes him
a while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock.
He eases door open, moves inside --
Near the entrance, outside the door to KLUTE's
apartment below. We open on BREE. She shouts
angrily, miserably --
BREE
Whyn't you just cut out?
We WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE. Now she begins to get
it. He turns, opens door to his room below. She
comes slowly down steps.
-- Klute out, looking around --
The figure -- the man -- scissoring over the low
walls where one brownstone joins another. Klute
gives chase -- over ridges, past water tanks,
oddments of roof furniture --
The FIGURE races to a roof door disappearing into
abandoned building.
A shot catching the edge of CENTRAL PARK itself --
our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be
limousined APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF C.P.W. The
FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE walking upstreet, turning
under one of the canopies -- (Klute carries a
zipper book-case).
BREE
Did you like my friend Frankie?
KLUTE
No.
BREE
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
KLUTE
It didn't go anywhere.
(then)
But that's not why --
BREE
About the dumper, didn't he tell
you that?
KLUTE
It was Jane McKenna who sent you
the dumper.
BREE
(coldly)
Well -- she's dead.
At the corner he slows, starts unzipping his
bookcase as if indicating a change of route.
BREE (CONT'D)
I thought you were going back to
the apartment.
KLUTE
(he shakes his head)
You said you wanted these.
He hands over the TAPE-REELS.
BREE
Oh golly, oh just what I've always
dreamed of, dirty phone calls.
(then)
How come?
KLUTE
You told me what you could. I guess
I'm through with your part of it.
BREE
(grudgingly)
Is there anything more I could --
KLUTE
I don't see anything, do you?
BREE
What're you gonna do next?
KLUTE
Try some other ways.
(starts off)
BREE
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for
that clown to fall through the
skylight on me?
KLUTE
And I don't think that was Tom.
BREE
You said it was!
KLUTE
No, I said what did you think.
BREE
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said
that just to keep me scared. So I'd
tell you everything I -- oh clever;
oh you smart, tricky hick.
KLUTE
Well --
BREE
(harshly)
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute?
A little?
KLUTE
Yeah, you got to me.
BREE
-- Us city folks? The sin, the
glitter, the wickedness?
KLUTE
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it
was more -- I don't know --
(hunts the word)
-- too bad? Pathetic?
BREE
Goodbye.
She turns smartly away, deposits the tapes in
passing in a litter box, departs. Klute looks after
her for a moment, then turns on his way. Then --
FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE - DAY
This shot holds both in view for a moment, until
they both disappear separately in the traffic.
CAMERA moves in slightly on litterbox as a man's
hand comes into frame and removes the tapes.
Bree comes out, turns.
KLUTE
You asked if there was anything
more you could help me with.
BREE
When?
Pause. Impasse.
KLUTE
I've checked the records of Jane
McKenna's death -- I can't get
anything special. But Frank
Ligourin had another girl you said,
besides McKenna and you.
BREE
Arlyn Page.
KLUTE
Did she and Jane McKenna know each
other?
BREE
Frankie kept them in the same
apartment: it cut his travel-time.
KLUTE
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the
Dumper too.
BREE
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin
- she's the one who started Frank.
She's strung out now; you won't
find her.
KLUTE
You could help me find her. You
know the people.
(as she turns away)
I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
BREE
I can make that in a lunch break!
(then)
Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't
just me? -- you decided you liked
it, after all, the other night;
you'll hang around for seconds?
KLUTE
Don't worry.
She examines him -- shrugs -- turns, proceeds along
the sidewalk, Klute accompanying --
In the small hours. The same place seen previously,
the gathering place. KLUTE, BREE arriving and
entering.
STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT
Outside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th
Avenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES
UNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons and
consults another. They seem to know of Arlyn --
haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere --
A shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs.
Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same
time that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent.
MRS. VASEK
The whore, yeah. I threw out.
KLUTE
Do you know where she went from
here?
MRS. VASEK
Live like animals. Her and the man.
Out.
KLUTE
(reacts)
Was she living with a man?
We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE
We still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This is
a genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move along
street. We see Bree drop back a little, Klute
waiting for her to catch up.
KLUTE
What's the matter?
BREE
(glances about)
What the hell do you think's the
matter.
(then suggests)
I could wait for you someplace.
KLUTE
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom
Grunemann --
BREE
(eagerly)
-- Then you don't need me.
KLUTE
But if it's someone else I do.
He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow.
(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their
manners now - a reluctant collaboration.)
BREE
You sure pull a lot of mileage out
of a hundred dollars.
-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses
street diagonally toward a half-framed house.
CAMERA pans from night view of New York City to
KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to
comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM
GRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the
mysteries of the behavior of BREE.
SKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Alongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment
lights up. He looks through the skylight and sees
BREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking
to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking
to FRANK LIGOURIN.
KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits
and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He
sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of
parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN &
BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he
leaves.
The CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standing
at the window to a wide angle looking at CABLE
through the window. The window is 30 or 40 stories
high. The wide angle lens almost makes the building
look like it is standing on point, and CABLE, a man
suspended in space.
A TUGBOAT has pulled in. The SOUND of its heavy
ENGINES, IDLING, runs underneath this entire
sequence. A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at the
head of the dock. We see several figures on the
rear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this
distance what they're doing. The POLICE CAR WITH
KLUTE arrives. He dismounts and proceeds from dock
to tug-deck.
TRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives, but
doesn't greet him. His attention, like the others,
is directed downward and
off-scene (to the surface of the water actually,
just outboard of the tug). We see beside Trask TWO
Uniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS.
And we hear, along with the throbbing of the
engines, a stirring about of the water and a
peculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the
engines -- which we can't at first identify.
Klute joins the group, watches.
SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant
neoprene body bag. INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD
LIB, UNDER --
TRASK
(toward Klute)
They were bringing a freighter down
through Kill Van Kull; propellers
washed it up on top.
SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached
with short ropes. He complains --
SUGARMAN
Why didn't you bring it up on deck?
DECKHAND
Would you bring it up on deck?
They slip the basket downward, out of frame (into
the water).
DECKHAND (CONT'D)
(to other)
Mickey, get something. Get the eels
off.
SPENCE
(calmly)
They'll drop off theirselves when
she comes out.
We CUT TO -
BERGER - DAY
We see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboat
cabin -- we haven't seen him before -- with his
hands bunched in front of his mouth. We identify
the noise which may have puzzled us before -- his
SOBBING.
DOWNSHOT: SURFAICE OF WATER, BASKET, BODY
We catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being
lifted, just before it breaks the surface of the
water.
FAVORING KLUTE
Klute looks on as EFFECTS trace the processing of
the body. SPENCE kneels down out of frame to slide
the bag around it. TRASK kneels down to make a
brief examination -- straightens again. To Klute --
TRASK
It'll go to the Examiner. But I
don't see nothin that means nothin.
We MOVE WITH KLUTE as he turns and moves away a few
feet along deck. Here he stands. Then SUGARMAN
moves into view holding a clipboard. Routinely --
SUGARMAN
You help us with ID? We can't get
nothin from him.
He indicates the direction of Berger. Klute
examines the clipboard data.
KLUTE
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.
She went by the names Terry Arlyn
and June Price. She may have been
from Pittsburgh, someone told me. I
can give you a list of people who
knew her, if that would help to --
SUGARMAN
No point, thanks.
KLUTE
Is he claiming the body?
SUGARMAN
Uh uh, that'd mean funeral
expenses.
He spits, moves back in the direction of the group;
Klute continues to stand. BERGER moves in his
direction. Brokenly --
BERGER
Man could you help me?
Klute doesn't understand his purport, reacts
instantly, sympathetically --
KLUTE
Yeah, what?
BERGER
You know, help me out. That's my
baby there, dead. I got to get up.
Klute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger
insists --
BERGER (CONT'D)
Man you don't know what that does
to me, my baby dead --
KLUTE
-- You've got to get up.
BERGER
Yeah.
Klute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very
sharply, off the tugboat.
Klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down
on one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him we
see what might be a profound awe and grief at all
these things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more.
EFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven
away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out
again.
TRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling,
looks at him speculatively. Silence. Then --
TRASK
That's how the other one died, you
know. In the water.
KLUTE
(nods)
I looked it up.
Then -- (we are assuming a complete understanding
here between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. What
Trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful?
Do we both suspect the same man?)
TRASK
Well?
KLUTE
Yeah.
The street as we saw it just previously... still
daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing
toward dusk.
DISSOLVE:
The street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say.
Some lit windows; a single car moving past.
DISSOLVE:
All the windows dark this time. The deepest night,
just before the sky begins to lighten.
DISSOLVE:
The street's first stirrings. From not far off, the
sounds of trash cans being collected.
DISSOLVE:
Sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and
elegant architecture.
Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the
civilized monuments to man's search for culture.
CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealing
Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse
topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of
Liberty. This is the municipal storehouse.
KLUTE & BREE
Bree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation
of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper.
She is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity,
and Klute is amused by her enjoyment.
OUTDOOR NURSERY - EIGHT AVENUE - NEXT TO MARKET
The nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of
greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the
avenue.
Klute and Bree wander through the plants.
BREE
I saw Mr. Faber.
(beat)
You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
KLUTE
(controlledly)
Yeah.
BREE
Is that all you have to say?
KLUTE
What am I supposed to say?
BREE
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh -
go there any more.
(pause)
I know it's tough to understand,
but it wasn't easy. You see, he was
nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just
him. I got something out of it too
I guess. Anyway, I told him I
wouldn't go there anymore.
She is like a child awaiting praise from her
teacher. Klute says nothing. They continue walking
among the plants and he picks up a few that she had
admired.
KLUTE
Well, here's your gold star.
Considering his contempt for all the dead plant
life he has seen in her apartment in the past, she
is pleased by this act of belief in her.
BREE
Spangler says we have a
relationship.
KLUTE
What?
BREE
You and I -- a relationship.
KLUTE
I was wondering what that was.
BREE
(beat)
Hell there's nothing so mysterious
about the square life.
Bree, Klute approach unhurriedly along the
sidewalk. She is holding his arm, HUMS to herself,
enjoys the evening.
People are boarding helicopter.
CABLE
Why would they deal with you? You
don't know these people.
Klute is momentarily at a loss -- not a question
he'd prepared for -- improvises.
KLUTE
No, but Bree does. She's
negotiating for me. Bree Daniel.
Cable takes an instant to compute the thing. Then --
CABLE
I can talk it over; possibly I can
get the money. When are you meeting
the man?
KLUTE
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River
Drive and 73rd Street.
CABLE
Suppose I meet you there a half
hour before.
KLUTE
Just send me a money order.
CABLE
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
ATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the
helicopter.
Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a
goodbye gesture.
KLUTE
Well --
CABLE
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
We bring Klute along street, and into the
Brownstone.
Klute comes out of door -- goes down steps to his
own apartment. A passerby stops him for directions
and doesn't seem to notice the blood on his sleeve.
Klute goes into his apartment.
Bree comes out of door - goes down steps -
hesitates in front of Klute's apartment struggling
with the question of whether to knock. CAMERA pulls
back to reveal we are watching her through the
windshield of a car in the parking lot across the
street. CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the
back of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching
her. Bree starts to knock on Klute's door but stops
herself and walks down the street. Cable's head
moves out of the shot. We hear the sound of the car
door opening and closing. Through the windshield we
see Cable cross in front of the car and start to
follow Bree down the street.
Bree is about a quarter block away from the
Brownstone now, hurrying. She waves in the
direction of a cab, misses it, continues on. We CUT
TO --
Cable stands looking after her, hesitates over
choice of action, decides to follow.
We establish the distance between them -- Cable 100
or so feet behind her, unnoticed by her,
maintaining about the same pace, not -- at this
point -- trying to overtake (perhaps waiting for
less populated surroundings) We CUT BACK TO --
Bree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of
those temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her,
nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE.
We see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running along
street. He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts
the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of
it. The Driver starts to lean out to object. Klute
mashes him back inside, enters the cab. We CUT BACK
TO --
LOFT) - DAY (NIGHT)
Klute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way
across the roof. Man in hotel window across street
holding drink - watches him with amused curiosity.
Klute spots entrance to stairway.
We see the body tracing its quick path down the
dark side of the building.
DAY (NIGHT)
The sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER.
