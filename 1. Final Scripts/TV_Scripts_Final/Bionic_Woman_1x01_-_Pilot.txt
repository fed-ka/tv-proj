      BLACKNESS.

      Darkness, impenetrable.  For a moment we hear nothing but
      BREATHING, harsh, labored -- someone in PAIN, fighting for
      every gasping breath.  For life.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          (curious, pleasant)
                    Who are you?

      The sound of WHIPPING WIND rises to blend with the harsh
      BREATHING, as we --

      FADE UP ON:

      EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

      TIGHT ON A WOMAN'S FACE -- bloody, bruised, lip cut and
      bleeding, breath RASPING painfully.

      She's twenty-four, beautiful, and currently getting the shit
      beaten out of her.

      This is JAIME SOMMERS.

      WIDEN to see we're on a ROOFTOP, WIND gusting and eddying
      through a forest of CITY BUILDINGS.

      A WOMAN (we heard her VOICE over black) stands over Jaime,
      back to us -- she continues TALKING in the same calm,
      CONVERSATIONAL tone.

                                      WOMAN
                    Or maybe I should be asking... what
                    are you?

      -- and she KICKS Jaime in the stomach, almost casually. 
      Jaime CURLS in on herself, biting off the urge to SCREAM.

      She rolls painfully onto her hands and knees, wind whipping
      her hair across her face -- then LOOKS UP, eyes fixing on
      the Woman, not in pain or fear, but DEFIANCE.

                                      JAIME
                          (gasping for breath)
                    Shouldn't I -- be asking -- you?

      REVERSE ON THE WOMAN, giving us our first good look at her: 
      strikingly beautiful, sleekly muscled, maybe 30 --

      -- and with brutal, indifferent strength, she GRABS Jaime by
      the hair and JERKS her to her feet.

      Later we'll know her name:  SARAH.                                                                                          2.

      She STARES Jaime in the eye, inches apart, an edge of WEIRD
      INTIMACY between these two people who are obviously STRANGERS.

                                      SARAH
                          (like a dare)
                    So ask.

      Jaime STARES right back at her, bruised and beaten, like
      someone taking a CHALLENGE --

                                      JAIME
                    Who the hell are you?

      Sarah's answer is a GHOST OF A SMILE -- and she raises her
      arm to BACKHAND Jaime.  Her bladed hand comes WHISTLING down --
      and the INSTANT before impact, we --

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET ALONG THE BAY -- DAWN

      The sun is barely rising over SAN FRANCISCO -- hilly streets,
      Victorian houses butting up against sweeping modern buildings,
      quaint and cosmopolitan at once.

        SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO WEEKS EARLIER 

      Follow a FIGURE JOGGING on a road overlooking the water, a
      SILHOUETTE against the brightening sun-streaked sky -- it's

      JAIME, running alone along the water in JOGGING SWEATS.  She
      SPRINTS through the streets, turns INLAND, heading home.

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- TENDERLOIN -- MORNING

      Jaime picks up the speed, RACING the last few yards through
      the dingy neighborhood, reaching a CRUMBLING EDWARDIAN
      BUILDING, once an elegant hotel, now LOW RENT APARTMENTS.

      INT. JAIME'S APARTMENT -- DAY

      A wreck of an apartment, a tiny two-bedroom.  A dirty window
      shows a view of a BRICK WALL.  Dishes are piled in the sink,
      clothes strewn over the furniture.

      A TEENAGE GIRL, BECCA, sleeps soundly on the couch in what
      looks like yesterday's clothes.  She'd be pretty if she
      weren't so relentlessly determined not to be.  Everything in
      her wardrobe is shades of BLACK, including her dyed hair.

      JAIME comes hurrying in, hastily stripping off her running
      clothes as she heads for the shower, grabbing up DIRTY CLOTHES
      as she goes --

                                      JAIME
                    You're going to be late.                                                                                          3.

      Becca rolls over grouchily, burrowing under the blanket.

                                      BECCA
                    I'll catch a ride with Jason.

                                      JAIME
                          (unimpressed)
                    You'll catch a disease from Jason, 
                    more likely.  You are not getting in
                    a car with that kid.

      Jaime STRIPS the blanket off Becca as she passes.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Breakfast after I shower, then we're
                    leaving in ten.

      Becca slithers off the couch, looks after Jaime resentfully.

      INT. KITCHENETTE -- DAY

      The cramped kitchenette.  Jaime's at the sink, dishes are
      everywhere, but BECCA'S BREAKFAST is laid neatly on the tiny
      table:  eggs, bacon, fruit, toast, milk, like an ad for the
      perfect BALANCED BREAKFAST.

      Becca ignores it, grabs a POPTART and BLACK COFFEE.

      Jaime is tossing the cooking pan in the sink as she hastily
      shrugs on a STARBUCK'S UNIFORM --

                                      JAIME
                          (eyes the poptart)
                    That's not food.

                                      BECCA
                    Thank you, Rachael Ray.

      Becca belts back the coffee like a shot.

      INT.  HALLWAY -- DAY

      Jaime carries the bulging laundry bag as she and Becca clatter
      down the stairs, the door of one of the apartments opens --

      -- and they almost COLLIDE with MRS. ARAKELIAN, their
      DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR, a hardy-looking older EASTERN EUROPEAN,
      early 60's, wearing a NURSE'S UNIFORM.

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                          (Armenian accent)
                    You're going to be late again.
                          (as they hurry past)
                    Your stomach flu is better, no?                                                                                          4.

                                      JAIME
                    I'm fine, thanks.  That tea really
                    helped.

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                    Come by later, I have something for
                    you!

                                      JAIME
                    No problem.  See you!

                                      BECCA
                          (under her breath)
                    Whatever it is this time, I'm not
                    reading it, wearing it, applying it,
                    or eating it, ok?

      Jaime gives up, pulls the door open, herding Becca through.

      EXT. CAR ON ROAD -- DAY

      A truly tragic Ford Pinto hatchback, circa 1974, makes its
      way through the crowded, steep city streets.

      INT. CAR ON ROAD -- DAY

      Jaime drives, weaving through the narrow streets during rush
      hour as she talks on wireless earpiece, Becca beside her --

                                      JAIME
                          (into earpiece)
                    I won't be late -- I mean, not very
                    late.  Well, maybe a couple of
                    minutes.  Five minutes.  But
                      absolutely not more than ten --
                            (gratefully)
                    Thanks, Maggie.  I owe you.

      As Jaime clicks off the phone --

                                      BECCA
                    You know you look like a homeless
                    person talking to aliens when you
                    use that thing.

                                      JAIME
                          (refusing to be baited)
                    It's better than wrapping the car
                    around a tree.

                                      BECCA
                    Depends.  Do we have insurance?

      Jaime glances over to answer, and suddenly notices a BANDAGE
      peeking out from under the collar of Becca's shirt.                                                                                          5.

                                      JAIME
                          (sudden suspicion)
                    What's that?

      Becca SCRUNCHES down in her seat a little.  BUSTED.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Oh my god.  You got another one,
                    didn't you?
                          (off Becca's sullen
                            silence)
                    We talked about this --

                                      BECCA
                    No.  You talked, and I ignored you.

                                      JAIME
                    You're fifteen.  It's not even legal
                    for you to get a tattoo, and now you
                    have two --

                                      BECCA
                          (quietly)
                    Three.

                                      JAIME
                    -- and has it ever occurred to you
                    that someone who'll take a fake i.d. 
                    to put permanent ink in your skin
                    might not necessarily --
                          (doubletakes)
                    Three?  You have three?
                          (sudden dread)
                    Where's the third one?

                                      BECCA
                    Don't worry.  You'll never see it.

      EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

      The Pinto SCREECHES to an uneven halt outside Becca's school.

      INT. CAR -- OUTSIDE SCHOOL -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                                      JAIME
                    Rebecca Amanda Sommers, you had 
                    better not be telling me --

      Becca JERKS her door open, then turns on Jaime with sudden,
      intense EMOTION --

                                      BECCA
                    Don't do that, ok?  Don't talk like
                    her.  You're not Mom.

      Jaime doesn't back down, though that had to hurt.                                                                                          6.

                                      JAIME
                    No.  I'm your sister, and I'm
                      responsible for you --

      Becca gets out of the car, turns in the open door.

                                      BECCA
                    We've only got two more years where
                    you have to pretend like you give a
                    damn, so let's just make it through
                    them without killing each other, ok?

      Becca SLAMS the car door shut and heads into school without
      looking back.

      Jaime runs her hand through her hair, frustrated -- then
      hastily glances at her watch, realizing how LATE it is.

                                      JAIME
                      Goddammit.

      EXT. STARBUCKS -- DAY

      The one, the only.  A LINE of patrons SNAKES out the door. 
      We might notice a large, modern HOSPITAL across the street.

      Jaime desperately tries to find a parking place-- between
      two SUV'S, she sees what looks like a space, starts turning --

      -- and realizes too late it's TAKEN, by a small blue PORSCHE,
      parked across two spaces and pulled so far forward it was
      hidden behind the SUV.  Jaime grits her teeth as she starts
      to back up, cars HONKING BEHIND HER.

      INT. STARBUCKS -- DAY

      Jaime hastily ties on her apron as she comes to the drink-
      prep area, joining a dark-haired, warm YOUNG WOMAN, MAGGIE,
      who's taking written-on cups from the cashiers and making
      coffees at BLINDING SPEED.

                                      MAGGIE
                          (pointing out)
                      Twenty-three minutes.  I'm gonna get
                    carpal tunnel --
                          (puts up a drink)
                    Triple shot latte, extra foam!

                                      JAIME
                            (apologetically)
                    I had to park in outer Mongolia.

      Jaime starts pouring and mixing as well.  They keep working
      as they talk, putting up drinks as they go.                                                                                          7.

                                      MAGGIE
                    Venti cappucino, soy!
                          (back to Jaime)
                    Yeah, Pretentious Porsche Guy has
                    been here since dawn.

      She nods over at a GUY sitting at a table with a brand new
      laptop computer.  Mid-twenties, good looking in a poser way.

                                      JAIME
                    How can he even own that car when
                    all he does is sit in here all day,
                    pretend to write, and harass us?
                          (puts up drink)
                    Hazelnut vanilla latte!
                          (back to Maggie,
                            ranting)
                    Doesn't he have a job?

      Maggie gives her an appraising glance.

                                      MAGGIE
                    Wow, Jaime's hostile.  That's --
                    strangely refreshing.

                                      JAIME
                          (steaming milk)
                    I'm not hostile.  It's just, if he
                    asks me why he can't have a free
                    refill one more time I'm gonna pour
                    one down his pants.
                          (puts up drink)
                    Caff  Mocha!
                          (relenting)
                    I'm having a bad morning, that's
                    all.

                                      MAGGIE
                    Just don't pee in anyone's cappucino,
                    ok?
                          (puts up drink)
                    Chai tea latte!

      INT. STARBUCKS -- DAY -- LATER

      Jaime is behind the register now; rush hour is past, it's
      gotten QUIETER -- but PRETENTIOUS PORSCHE GUY is at the
      counter, ARGUING with her.

                                      JAIME
                    Sir, we've never had free refills. 
                    Ever.  Never, ever.

                                      PORSCHE GUY
                    Eddie's down the street has free
                    refills.  Maybe I should take my
                    business there.                                                                                          8.

      Jaime flicks her eyes from him, to his TABLE in the corner --
      it's like a NEST piled with papers, computer, jacket, empty
      CUPS -- and she looks back at him.

                                      JAIME
                    Please...
                          (beat, straight face)
                    Don't make me beg.

      Porsche Guy GLOWERS at her.

                                      PORSCHE GUY
                    You can't force me to go, you know
                    that?

      He turns and STALKS back to his table and his computer.

                                      JAIME
                          (under her breath)
                    I really, really do.

      She turns back -- to see

      A GOOD LOOKING GUY, early 30's, standing at the counter. 
      Wearing surgical scrubs, he's intense in a way halfway between
      nerdy and sexy.  His name is ERIC MASTERS.

                                    ERIC
                    You know, someone should start
                    charging him rent.

      She GRINS at him -- and he grins right back.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    I've got half an hour.  Did you take
                    your break yet?

      INT. STARBUCKS -- TABLE BY WINDOW -- DAY

      Jaime sits with Eric at a table by the huge, arched window
      fronting the Starbucks.

                                    ERIC
                    Well, there's IPL laser ablation. 
                    That's pretty much state of the art
                    for tattoo removal.  Scorches the
                    ink right out --

                                      JAIME
                    Great.  'Cause if I make her burn a
                    few layers of her skin off, that'll
                      definitely improve the relationship.

      She puts down her tea, looks out the window, lost in thought. 
      Eric watches her, a little concerned.                                                                                          9.

                                    ERIC
                    It's crazy that you're feeling bad
                    about this.  When your parents died,
                    you dropped out of school for her. 
                    You took this --
                          (gestures at their
                            surroundings)
                    -- this "job" --

                                      JAIME
                          (cutting him off)
                    -- that pays well, has flexible hours
                    and gives us both health insurance.

                                    ERIC
                    It's not a career, Jaime.  What are
                    you doing here?  This is a waste of
                    your time and your talents.

      Jaime gives a half-smile, but it has an EDGE.

                                      JAIME
                    What talents would those be, exactly?

                                    ERIC
                    The ones that got you a free four-
                    year ride at Columbia.

                                      JAIME
                          (brushing it off)
                    That was a long time ago.  And a
                      half-finished degree in Shakespearean
                    lit is not exactly a marketable skill,
                    per se.

                                    ERIC
                    You could be a professor --

      Jaime is starting to get FRUSTRATED -- they've had this
        conversation before.

                                      JAIME
                    Eric -- I don't even qualify to teach
                    high school.  And I don't have time
                    to go back to finish my degree, not
                    yet.  Becca needs me --
                          (off his look)
                    She's still a kid, ok?  Even if her
                    hormones are trying to trick her
                    into thinking she's not.

                                    ERIC
                    Yeah, well, when I was a teenager I 
                    was studying 24-7 --                                                                                        10.

                                      JAIME
                            (countering, teasing)
                    You were in college at 15 and a
                    surgeon by twenty-two.  You're not
                    exactly representative.

                                    ERIC
                    What's that supposed to mean?

                                      JAIME
                    You're a freak.  An overachieving,
                    utterly focused, completely caffeine-
                    addicted freak.

                                    ERIC
                    Don't mock my dependency.  It brought
                    me in here.  To you.
                          (slugs back more
                            espresso)
                    You know, if I adopted you, you'd
                    have killer health insurance.

                                      JAIME
                    That's disturbing on so many levels
                    I don't even know where to start.

                                    ERIC
                    Yeah, you're right.  Adoption's out.
                          (trying to sound casual)
                    Maybe you two should just move in
                    with me.

      Jaime TENSES, just a little.  This is a sore subject.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    Becca could have the downstairs
                    bedroom.  I'll even spring for a
                    cat.

                                      JAIME
                    I don't want to fight about this
                    again --

                                    ERIC
                          (serious now)
                    So don't fight.  Say yes.
                            (frustrated)
                    Jaime, just let me --

                                      JAIME
                          (flaring)
                    What?  Take care of me?

                                    ERIC
                            (correcting)
                    -- help.  Let me help.                                                                                        11.

                                      JAIME
                    I can take care of myself.  And Becca. 
                    I've been doing it a long time.

      She starts to get up, taking her tea.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Charity's not a good foundation for
                      a relationship.

      Eric grabs her hand, frustrated, trying to get her to stay. 
      There's obvious, naked LOVE in his expression -- just a
      blinding need to make better what hurts her.

                                    ERIC
                    James --

      His BEEPER goes off.  Getting to his feet, he checks it.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    Gotta get back across the street. 
                    Let's just -- are we still on for
                    dinner?

                                      JAIME
                            (doubtfully)
                    I don't know, I've got a lot to mphhh --

      She's totally cut off as he KISSES her, serious, intense. 
      He pulls back -- Jaime can't help but SMILE up at him --

      -- and then she notices that people are STARING at them. 
      Behind the counter, Maggie is SMIRKING mightily.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                          (low)
                    We go dutch.  And I choose the
                      restaurant.

                                    ERIC
                    Pick you up tonight.

      He takes off, loping quickly across the street to the
      HOSPITAL.  Jaime straightens her hair, trying not to blush
      too hard as she comes behind the counter.

      INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      Someone is KNOCKING at the door as Jaime quickly gets her
      stuff together.  Becca trails her, not happy.

                                      BECCA
                    I don't need a babysitter.  It's
                      insulting.

                                      JAIME
                    It's insurance.                                                                                        12.

      Jaime opens the door -- MRS. ARAKELIAN stands in the hall,
      holding a large POT, a stack of something made of YARN, and
      a small paper bag.

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                    I brought mufflers.

      She pulls out the yarn, revealing that it is indeed two
      MUFFLERS, handknitted.

                                      BECCA
                    Yeah, it's been snowing indoors a
                    lot lately.

      Becca goes into her room, SHUTS the door decisively.

                                      JAIME
                    Maybe I shouldn't go --

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                          (shrugging)
                    Maybe I should stuff a muffler down
                    her throat.  Go.  Me, I hope you
                    stay all night.  What's wrong with
                    her, you can't fix.
                          (carrying the pot)
                    I'll just put this in the fridge. 
                    It's fish.

                                      JAIME
                          (a little nervous)
                    What kind of fish?

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                    Big.  With a head.

      Mrs. Arakelian crosses to the fridge.

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN (CONT'D)
                    It's good for you.  You need protein.

                                      JAIME
                    Thanks, but I'm over the stomach
                    thing, really --

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                    You know, before I came to this
                    country, I worked for years in the
                    hospital in Yerevan.
                          (moving things around
                          in the fridge)
                    I was the best, the best -- all the
                    doctors ask for me.  "I want Baba
                    Nika," they say, "get me Baba Nika!"

      Triumphantly, she shoves the pot into the fridge, turns back
      to Jaime.                                                                                        13.

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN (CONT'D)
                    I knew things even they didn't know.

      Mrs. Arakelian hands her the small paper bag, closes Jaime's
      hand over it.

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN (CONT'D)
                    The best.
                          (pats her hand)
                    You stay out all night.  Go ahead.

      Jaime meets her eyes, confused, then looks down quizzically
      at the small bag.

      EXT. CAR ON BLUFF -- NIGHT

      JAIME AND ERIC sit on the hood of Eric's CAR, parked on a
      bluff off a windy road.  The OCEAN is CRASHING against the
      ragged cliff far below;  the road is DESERTED.

      They're unpacking fast food bags.  Eric pulls out his fries; 
      Jaime is oddly QUIET, looking DISTRACTED.

                                    ERIC
                    I said you could pick a restaurant. 
                    Burger Boy barely even qualifies as
                    food.
                          (as he unwraps a burger)
                    You really don't want to know what's
                    in this stuff.  It's amazing how
                    much flavor you can get from deep
                    frying something and coating it in
                    salt --

      He notices Jaime's STARING OFF into the darkness.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                          (a little worried)
                    Hey... are you still upset over Becca
                    being pissed at you?  'Cause
                      seriously, she'll pick a fight with
                    you over breathing.  I don't know
                    what her problem is --

                                      JAIME
                    It's me.

      As he looks at her, curiously, Jaime continues:

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    They -- were coming out to see me. 
                    My parents.  I'd gotten this Honors
                    thing, there was an award dinner and
                    they were flying out for it.
                          (hesitates, then)
                    I wanted them to come.  I asked them
                    to be there...                                                                                        14.

      Jaime is obviously affected by the memory, but at the same
      time strangely DETACHED -- as if she's been forced to keep
      the full force of the pain at bay, just to survive.

      Eric is watching her, WORRIED, he's clearly never heard this
      part of the story.

                                    ERIC
                    The plane crash -- ?

                                      JAIME
                    Becca was 11.  That's what she
                      remembers... that they left for me,
                    and they never came back.

      Eric reaches over, takes her hand.

                                    ERIC
                    They were your parents, too.  It's
                    not your fault.

                                      JAIME
                    After they died, that first day, I
                    went running.  I ran, and ran, and
                    ran.  Like... if I could just go
                    fast enough, I could get away.  But
                    some things, you can't run away from.

      She looks away, over the crashing ocean waves.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    It felt like the world was falling
                    on me, like this weight that was so
                    heavy it would crush me.  I never
                    thought -- the last thing I ever
                    wanted was more.  More responsibility,
                    more to take care of.
                          (abruptly)
                    I'm pregnant.

      Eric is SURPRISED into total silence.  Jaime starts to speed
      up, her speech becoming NERVOUS and QUICK.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, I didn't believe it either. 
                    Turns out, stomach flu?  Not so much.
                    Good thing Mrs. A put two pregnancy
                    tests in the bag.

                                    ERIC
                          (totally confused)
                    What?

      But Jaime doesn't even seem to hear him, just PLOWS forward,
      determined, all of it coming out in a RUSH:                                                                                        15.

                                      JAIME
                          (rapid, nervous)
                    I don't want you to -- I just -- I
                    know this isn't something you just
                    spring on someone, except for the
                    part where that's exactly what I'm
                    doing to you right now.  And I know
                    that you're in a place in your career
                    where you can't even think about
                    this, and god, I'm only twenty-four,
                    it's not -- I mean -- I said to
                    myself, well, there's only one thing
                    to do --

                                    ERIC
                          (breaking in)
                    Jaime --

                                      JAIME
                          (relentlessly)
                    -- but the point is, I couldn't even
                    think about it, not even for a second,
                    not half a second.  I couldn't.
                          (repeating)
                    I never thought I would want more. 
                    But I do.  And it just feels -- like
                    this is something I'm going to do. 
                    I don't know how --
                          (a determined edge)
                    -- but somehow.  And I know this is
                    my choice, and I'll live with it. 
                    I'll take responsibility for it.  I
                    will.

      As she stops to take a breath, Eric finally INTERRUPTS --

                                    ERIC
                    Let's get married.

      A half-second of pure SHOCK before Jaime manages:

                                      JAIME
                    Let's -- I'm sorry?

      His voice is GENTLE, a counterpoint to her staccato, defensive
      speech, like she's a wild animal that might run away --

                                    ERIC
                    You want to keep the baby.  And I
                    want to keep you.
                          (grins)
                    It's a sign from God.

                                      JAIME
                    But --
                            (helplessly)
                    -- you don't believe in God.                                                                                        16.

      Eric reaches out, brushes a strand of hair from her forehead.

                                    ERIC
                          (softly)
                    If you say yes, I might start.

      Jaime just looks at him for a moment -- and then they KISS,
      and it's sweet, and honest, one of those moments you remember
      the rest of your life.

      Even if you don't want to.

      INT./EXT. ERIC'S CAR ON ROAD -- NIGHT

      Jaime and Eric, driving down from the bluffs into the city. 
      She's feeding him fries as he navigates the sharp turns.

                                    ERIC
                    You realize this is it.
                          (off her curious look)
                    We're not eating any more of this
                    junk for the next eight months.

                                      JAIME
                    You have serious control issues, you
                    know that?

                                    ERIC
                    Shut up and feed me a fry, woman.

      EXT. ERIC'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

      Eric's car pulls up to a nice VICTORIAN on a steep San Fran
      street.  He pulls into the driveway, unfastens his seat belt.

                                      JAIME
                    I -- I should really get back --

                                    ERIC
                    I'm just going to run up and get
                      something.  It'll only take a minute.

                                      JAIME
                          (unfastens her belt)
                    I'll come with you.

      As he opens his door, Jaime gathers her courage:

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    You don't have to, you know.

      He turns back to look at her, not sure what she means --

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                            (explaining)
                    Marry me.                                                                                        17.

      The warm glow of headlights from passing cars WASH over them,
      rising and falling waves of LIGHT and SHADOW --

                                    ERIC
                          (quietly)
                    I know I don't.

      And he leans over to KISS her -- a GLARE of headlights washes
      over them, a HALO of white light -- and without warning --

      AN OUT OF CONTROL CAR sails over the curb and PLOWS into
      them with HORRIFIC force -- no brakes, no swerving, a full-
      speed COLLISION with the passenger side of Eric's car --

      Jaime's side.

      ERIC is THROWN CLEAR, FLUNG from the open driver's door to
      go FLYING through the air -- but

      JAIME is CRUSHED between the crumpled door and the dash, as--

      ERIC'S CAR, with Jaime in it, is LIFTED OFF the ground by
      the SHEER FORCE of the collision --

      -- and goes TUMBLING, side-over-side down the steeply inclined
      street in a SHOWER of SPARKS and SHATTERING GLASS.

      INT. CAR -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

      JAIME is TORN from the dash and THROWN like a rag doll as
      the car ROLLS over and over --

      POV JAIME, insanely QUICK CUTS, impressionistic moments of
      TERROR from the INSIDE of a rolling car:

      JAGGED METAL tearing free from the door --               
      BROKEN GLASS raining everywhere, some of it RED with BLOOD --
      UPSIDE DOWN, as the CAR TOP CRUMPLES in from IMPACT --     
      A SPEAR OF METAL tearing into her arm --                 
      THE DASHBOARD buckling like paper to CRUSH down on her legs --

      JAIME'S FACE is WHITE with terror, it's happening TOO FAST
      even to SCREAM --

      -- and she's FLUNG sideways against the bent, twisted
      doorframe, head hitting with a sickening THUNNKK! --

      -- and everything goes BLACK.

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                        18.

                                          ACT TWO

      INT. MEDFLIGHT HELICOPTER IN FLIGHT -- NIGHT

      BLURRED SHAPES move frantically;  as if from very FAR AWAY,
      the sound of CLOTH TEARING, a violent, RIPPING noise.  Other
      NOISES start to OVERLAP, plastic TORN OPEN, instruments
      CLANKING, MACHINES BEEPING -- and HUMAN VOICES, clipped and
      rapid-fire, overlapping.

                                      MEDFLIGHT TECH 1 (O.S.)
                      Multisystem trauma -- extensive crush
                    injuries to right arm and both legs --

                                      MEDFLIGHT TECH 2 (O.S.)
                    -- looks like massive internal
                    bleeding --

      The WHUPPPWHUPPPWHUPPP of HELICOPTER BLADES overlays it all
      as things slowly come INTO FOCUS -- HARSH LIGHTS, shinging
      down, limning two MEDFLIGHT TECHS working rapidly. 

                                      MEDFLIGHT TECH 3
                    What the hell happened to her?

                                      MEDFLIGHT TECH 1
                          (hurried aside)
                    Drunk driver.  He died at the scene --

      We're in JAIME'S POV, looking up from a gurney.

      REVERSE ON JAIME'S FACE, one eye covered with bloody gauze,
      the other struggling to FOCUS --

                                      MEDFLIGHT TECH 2
                    She's coming up!

      And suddenly, ERIC is bending down by Jaime's face -- his
      gloved hands streaked with BLOOD.  He's KNEELING over her.

                                      JAIME
                    Eric... ?

      There's CONFUSION in her face, and naked FEAR.

                                    ERIC
                    It's all right, baby.  We're going
                    to put you back to sleep.

      Eric STROKES her hair back from her face with one hand.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    I'm here... and I'm going to make it
                    ok.  I promise.

      Jaime's eyes FLUTTER, slowly EASING CLOSED -- she's OUT.                                                                                        19.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                          (low, determined)
                      I promise.*

      EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HILLS -- NIGHT

      A huge stretch of inland Northern California WILDERNESS --
      craggy, densely forested, peaceful in the moonlight.

      THE CHOPPER comes winging over the countryside.  We FOLLOW
      as it DIPS past a canyon, then crests a RISE -- to reveal

      A HUGE COMPLEX nestled among the hills, utterly UNEXPECTED.

      Long, low CENTRAL BUILDINGS, open paved spaces, what look
      like dorm-like RESIDENCES, all in a loose structure that
      give it the feeling of a SPRAWLING CAMPUS --

      -- except for the WALL topped with razorwire that surrounds
      the whole place.  GUARD TOWERS and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS dot
      the wall, even though we're in the middle of NOWHERE.

      THE HELICOPTER swoops down, aiming for the private LANDING
      STRIP inside the complex --

      -- where a MEDICAL TEAM is standing by, looking up in
      CONFUSION as the chopper lands.

      EXT. LANDING STRIP -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

      ERIC jumps down from the chopper, as the LEAD DOCTOR comes
      forward to meet him --

                                    LEAD DOCTOR
                          (very nervous)
                    Dr. Masters, surely a, a more
                      conventional hospital would be --

                                    ERIC
                      Facilities are better here.  Better
                    than anywhere.  You've got the whole
                    team?

                                    LEAD DOCTOR
                    Just like you said.  But surely -- I
                    don't understand why --

      The MED TECHS are already hurrying to the chopper, expertly
      getting Jaime out on the gurney.

                                    ERIC
                    You don't need to.

      INT. COMPLEX MEDICAL FACILITY -- O.R. -- NIGHT

      The O.R. is gleaming, high-tech, recognizable but subtly
      MORE ADVANCED than a traditional operating room.                                                                                        20.

        A glass-enclosed OBSERVATION DECK encircles the room above.

      JAIME lies on the table, intubated, draped as --

      ERIC AND TEAM OF DOCTORS work on her, the feeling one of
      barely controlled PANIC, Nurses RUSHING, doctors BARKING
      orders.  All the other doctors are MUCH OLDER than Eric, but
      he's clearly IN CHARGE.

                                    LEAD DOCTOR
                          (to Eric)
                    Multiple compound radial and ulnar
                    fractures of the right arm -- severed
                    brachial artery, transected median
                    nerve --
                          (grimly)
                    Right arm's a shredder.

                                      DOCTOR 2
                          (to Eric)
                    We're looking at complete AK
                      amputation on both legs --
                      neurovascular damage is catastrophic --

                                      DOCTOR 3
                    I've lost the fetal heartbeat.

      Eric LOOKS SHARPLY at Doctor 3, who SHAKES his head almost
      imperceptibly.  Eric closes his eyes for a instant, swallows
      hard -- then frantically goes back to work.

                                      NURSE 1
                    Dr. Masters, BP's falling, 40 over
                    60 --

                                    ERIC
                    Stabilize her, goddammit!

                                      NURSE 1
                    I can't!

      It's CHAOS as everyone SCRAMBLES -- Eric turns to Lead Doctor.

                                    ERIC
                          (flatly)
                    She's dying.

      The Lead Doctor doesn't answer.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    You know it, I know it -- and there's
                    only one way to stop it.

                                    LEAD DOCTOR
                    Dr. Masters, we can't --

      Eric's voice is cold as ICE as he ORDERS harshly:                                                                                        21.

                                    ERIC
                    Prep her.

      ALL THE SURGEONS AND NURSES stop, looking at Eric, the only
      sound in the room the WHOOSH of the ventilator and the BEEPING
      of machines -- and for some reason, they all look AFRAID.

                                    LEAD DOCTOR
                    But --

                                    ERIC
                          (shouting)
                    Do it now!

      And the room BURSTS into action again, Nurses and Doctors
      RACING around with renewed PURPOSE.

      EXT. COMPLEX -- DAWN

      The sun is creeping over the horizon as A PRIVATE JET comes
      to a halt on the landing strip.

      INT. COMPLEX MEDICAL FACILITY -- CORRIDOR -- DAWN

      Guards swing open the double glass doors to admit TWO MEN:

      JONAS BLEDSOE is first -- he owns all this, and it shows.  A
      tall, forceful man in his 50's, he wears POWER with
        unselfconscious ease.

      But just like Bill Gates will always be a nerd, Jonas will
      always be WORKING CLASS from the North of England -- rough
      edges, hard accent, a sense of total RUTHLESSNESS always
      hovering right beneath truly obscene amounts of wealth.

      He's flanked by JAE KIM, the head of his SPECIAL OPERATIONS
      division.  Wiry and lithe, early 30's, Jae is the opposite
      of the muscle-bound Spec Ops stereotype.

      As they stride down the corridor, the SECURITY CHIEF explains:

                                      SECURITY CHIEF
                    He's been at it for ten hours, sir.

                                      JONAS
                    Great.  Just bloody fantastic.  Why
                    didn't somebody stop him?

                                      SECURITY CHIEF
                    Um -- you gave him unrestricted
                    access.  Sir.

                                      JONAS
                    I did, didn't I.                                                                                        22.

                                    JAE
                          (sotto, to Jonas)
                    Told you.

      INT. COMPLEX -- OPERATING ROOM -- DAY

      ERIC and his TEAM OF DOCTORS work on Jaime.  Eric is using a
      ROBOTIC ARRAY with waldo-like hand controls, the "monitor" a
      3D HOLOGRAM projected directly over Jaime's body.

      ON THE HOLOGRAM, we can see the tiny, fine remote INSTRUMENTS
      that Eric is controlling with the array, working at the pelvic
      juncture of Jaime's RIGHT LEG.

      ERIC looks totally THRASHED, but he's still utterly FOCUSED,
      hands rock steady.  He doesn't even look up as JONAS enters --

                                    ERIC
                      I expected you a lot sooner.

                                      JONAS
                    I was in China.

                                    ERIC
                    Lucky me.

                                      JONAS
                    I didn't give permission for this,
                    Eric.

                                    ERIC
                    Funny, I don't remember asking for
                    it.
                          (to the Nurses)
                    Someone mask Mr. Bledsoe, please.

      THE MEDICAL TEAM is looking back and forth nervously between
      Jonas and Eric, like schoolkids waiting for a FIGHT --

      -- and Jonas gets a look at JAIME'S FACE.

                                      JONAS
                          (realizing)
                    Jesus, Eric -- it's your girlfriend?
                    The one works in a coffee shop?

                                    ERIC
                    Jaime.  Her name is Jaime.

                                      JONAS
                          (furious)
                    You're out your damned mind, boy. 
                    She's got no qualifications, no
                    training at all!  She's just some
                    girl --                                                                                        23.

      Eric looks up at him for the first time -- and the look in
      his eyes is SCARY.

                                    ERIC
                    Not to me.

      Eric's eyes are BLAZING as he stares Jonas down:

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    And if you ever want me working in
                    this room for you again, you won't
                    try to stop me now.

      A beat -- then:

                                      JONAS
                    You're gonna owe me for this one.

                                    ERIC
                          (right back to work)
                    Fine.  Get out.

      INT. OBSERVATION DECK OVER O.R. -- MORNING

      JAE stands at the observation window, watching the operation. 
      JONAS enters, comes up to stand beside him, watching as well.

                                      JONAS
                          (it's not a question)
                    You think I should stop him. 
                          (off Jae's silence)
                    It's important he feel there's debt
                    here.  But -- truth is, I don't mind.

                                    JAE
                    You should.

                                      JONAS
                    Most studies have a baseline, a blind
                    control.  We never did.

      Jonas looks down at the OPERATION, strangely SATISFIED.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    Until now.

      POV JONAS, looking down at JAIME'S SLEEPING FACE;  but through
      the glass, her features are slightly DISTORTED, blurry. 

      In every way that matters, to him she is UNKNOWN.

      INT. FACILITY -- HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

      C.U. JAIME'S FACE, SLEEPING fitfully.  Strangely, her FACE
      doesn't show the GASHES and LACERATIONS we saw on her --
      instead, there's only a few pale LINES of healing cuts and
      light BRUISING.  Her eyes DART, dreaming uneasily.                                                                                        24.

                                    ERIC (O.S.)
                    Jaime, can you hear me?

      Her eyes FLUTTER OPEN, focusing SLOWLY to see ERIC, sitting
      by her bed.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    You've been out for three days.
                          (gently)
                    Come back to me.

      She's in a hospital bed, sheets pulled up to her shoulders.

                                      JAIME
                          (a little groggy)
                    Hey...

      Jaime's eyes suddenly WIDEN as she REMEMBERS --

      FLASHBACK in split-second, fragmented images to JAIME'S POV
      INSIDE THE CAR CRASH:  SKIN covered with blood, DEAFENING
      NOISE, shattering glass, CRUNCHING METAL --

      BACK TO JAIME LYING IN THE BED as she looks up at Eric, the
      monitors behind her BEEPING faster as her heart rate SPIKES.

                                    ERIC
                          (worried)
                    Is something wrong?  Are you in pain?

                                      JAIME
                          (weak, bleary)
                    No, I... what happened?  I thought...
                          (shakily)
                    I thought I was dead.

      Eric looks DEEPLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

                                    ERIC
                    Jaime, there are some things I have
                    to tell you --

                                      JAIME
                          (sudden realization)
                    The baby.  What about the baby?

      Eric doesn't answer.  And it's all the answer she needs.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                          (stricken)
                    Oh my god.  Oh... oh god...

      She turns her head away from him, closing her eyes as if
      she's in TERRIBLE PAIN.

                                    ERIC
                    I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.  I couldn't --                                                                                        25.

      FLASHBACK TO THE CRASH: the dash CRUSHING down on her legs,
      the car ROLLING, glass EVERYWHERE, NOISE and HORROR --

      BACK ON JAIME as she turns back to him, with sudden FEAR.

                                      JAIME
                    My legs, they -- they don't hurt. 
                    They're just... numb.
                          (beginning to panic)
                    Why don't they hurt?

                                    ERIC
                    Ok, Jaime, wait, just stay calm --

      ON JAIME, feeling anything but calm, remembering MORE:

      FLASHBACK TO THE CRASH, more THUNDEROUS noise, images even
      FASTER: the car SPLATTERED with blood, her arm MANGLED at
      her side, legs BURIED beneath twisted metal --

      BACK TO JAIME, looking down at the sheets covering her body.

                                      JAIME
                    I can't feel my arm, either --

      Jaime starts to throw off the sheet -- and Eric GRABS her by
      the shoulders, gently but firmly HOLDING HER DOWN.

                                    ERIC
                    Just -- just listen for a second,
                    ok?  There's this man, Jonas Bledsoe. 
                    He owns this place.  He owns a lot
                    of things.  And I, I kind of moonlight
                    for him.  Doing surgical work. 
                    Very... experimental surgical work.*

      Jaime looks up at him, beginning to be truly AFRAID.

                                      JAIME
                          (small voice)
                    Eric... ?

      Eric is trying to be REASSURING, picking words carefully.

                                    ERIC
                    There are whole new areas of*
                      technology that he's been funding. *
                    I've developed a system to replace*
                    human body parts with biomechanical*
                    ones.  It's called "bionics."*

                                      JAIME
                    Eric -- what did you do to me?

      Eric stops trying to soft-pedal it.  He meets her eyes --                                                                                        26.

                                    ERIC
                          (bare honesty)
                    Both your legs and your arm had to
                    be replaced, as well as your right
                    ear and right eye.  Molecular machines
                    called nanocytes have been substituted
                    for one eighth of your blood cells --

      And Jaime doesn't wait for another word, she SHOVES him away
      as she RIPS the covering sheets off --

      -- and the force of what should have been a little PUSH sends
      Eric FLYING back, CLATTERING into a bank of EQUIPMENT that
      FALLS all around him.  He SCRAMBLES to his feet -- but --

      JAIME is staring down at her right arm, FROZEN with SHOCK.

      THE SKIN is TRANSPARENT, clear as plexiglass;  beneath, we
      can see the BIOMECHANICAL MACHINERY that is her new arm.

      It's NOT wires and metal and electronics -- the structures
      mimic human bones, muscles, tissues, but the colors and shapes
      are wrong, different, familiar and disturbing at once.

      BONES are black-silver TITANIUM CERAMICS;                   
      MUSCLES are STARK WHITE, flexible, striated, connected by
      GREEN TENDONS and LIGAMENTS, whipcord thin;                      
      VEINS pulse in a NETWORK of pale BLUE-WHITE "blood"; and TINY
      FLOWS OF MERCURY-LIKE QUICKSILVER race over everything,
      DARTING like lightning everywhere, BIONIC NERVE IMPULSES.

      Jaime looks like she's going to be SICK.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                          (desperately)
                    Listen to me, listen -- the nanocytes
                    are completing the graft, soon the
                    skin will look just like yours.

      Jaime looks down at the rest of her body;  she's wearing a
      white tank top and loose white scrub pants.  As Eric keeps
      talking, she JERKS both pants legs UP to look at her legs --

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    The nanocytes do maintenance and
                    healing, for both your bionics and
                    your body --

      JAIME'S LEGS ARE TRANSPARENT, just like her ARM, showing the
      INNER WORKINGS of the bionics beneath --

      -- blue-white blood PULSING through semi-transparent veins,
      silver NERVES branching and darting, white muscles BUNCHING
      and relaxing with every movement.

                                      JAIME
                    Oh, my god...                                                                                        27.

      Desperate to break through her horror, Eric grabs up a mirror,
      holds it up to her face --

                                    ERIC
                    You should have stitches and
                      lacerations bone deep all over your
                    face, but look.  You're healing at
                    an exponential rate -- all of you.

      And instead of answer, Jaime RIPS the bandage from her eye.
      She's RELIEVED for a moment, her eye looks NORMAL --

      -- but then Jaime sees the pupil has a strange EMERALD GREEN
      GLINT to it, like A CAT'S EYE REFLECTING in the dark.

      Jaime takes the mirror, holding it in her bionic hand, STARING
      at her eye -- and as she TENSES, the mirror CRACKS in her
      hand, SPIDERWEBBING.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                          (hastily)
                    Yeah, don't worry about that --
                    bionics are stronger than the, um,
                    what you had before.  The biosensors
                    just have to adjust, it's a call and
                    response process to develop a
                      neurofeedback loop --

                                      JAIME
                    Shut.  Up.
                          (shock becoming anger)*
                    Stop talking to me about grafts and
                    machines and nano-neuro-whatever --
                            (escalating)
                    This is my body, what did you do to
                    my body --

                                    ERIC
                          (desperately)
                    I saved it!  I saved you!  Your body
                    was broken, you were dying, and I
                    had to -- I had to -- just, just
                    look at your arm.  Look.

      Afraid of what she'll see, Jaime looks at her arm --

      ON JAIME'S BIONIC ARM as, with each RUSH of pulse, the bionic
      skin goes OPAQUE, looking for an instant like NORMAL SKIN,
      then back to transparent, then NORMAL again --

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    It's happening.  The nanocytes are
                    matching your bionics to your body; 
                      pigmentation, hair, muscle structures,
                      everything.                                                                                        28.

      Jaime stares as if MESMERIZED at her arm, CHANGING with each
      pulse, fascinated in spite of herself.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    With every heartbeat, it's turning
                    more into you.

                                      JAIME
                    Will these legs -- will I be able to
                    walk?

                                    ERIC
                    Your body has to learn how, just
                    like --
                          (voice catches)
                    -- a baby learns to use its arms and
                    legs.  But a hell of a lot quicker. 
                    The bionics are capable of adjusting
                    in a couple of hours.  

      Jaime is barely holding it together, looks up at Eric.*

                                      JAIME*
                    You've turned me into some kind of*
                    freak.*

        KERR-CRUNNCCHH!  Jaime looks in SHOCK at her right hand --
      she's CRUMPLED the steel bedrail like a roll of tinfoil. 

                                    ERIC
                    Actually, it's not just "stronger." 
                    More like, a lot stronger.

                                      JAIME
                    Leave me alone.

                                    ERIC
                    My lab is one floor down.  If you
                    need me...

                                      JAIME
                          (shouting)
                    You want me to say get out?  All
                    right:  get out!

      Eric turns and goes --

      -- and Jaime RIPS the crushed piece of bed railing off with
      a WHINE of tearing metal, then FLINGS it hard after him --

      CHLUNNKK! the railing SLAMS like an arrow into the wall by
      the door, QUIVERING with the force of her throw.

      Jaime falls back against the pillows, turns her face to the
      wall.

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                        29.

                                        ACT THREE

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY

      JONAS comes striding up the hallway to the door to Jaime's
      room.  A NURSE standing by the closed door stands aside,
      Jonas peers through the glass window to see

      JAIME on the floor, struggling to get her legs to obey her,
      trying to STAND.  Her arm and legs now look totally NORMAL.

                                      JONAS
                    How's she doing?

      The Nurse shrugs, nods toward the window --

                                      NURSE
                    She won't let anyone help her.

      -- as Jaime takes a faltering step, STUMBLES, then SPRAWLS
      with a bruising THUMP to the floor.

                                      NURSE (CONT'D)
                    But she keeps getting back up.

      INT. JAIME'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

      Jaime DRAGS herself up, sweating, determined, using the bed
      rail to pull herself to her feet, as JONAS enters.

                                      JONAS
                    I'm Jonas Bledsoe.  Eric told you
                    about me, I think.

                                      JAIME
                    Yeah --
                          (grunting as she pulls
                            herself up)
                    -- you own things.

      Jaime loses her balance for a second, FALLS, barely catching
      herself on the remaining bedrail --

                                      JONAS
                    Do you want a hand there?

      Jaime glances up at him from her position half-sprawled on
      the floor, clinging to the bed --

                                      JAIME
                    I'd rather crawl, thanks.

      Jonas shrugs, not offended, watching her with interest as
      she starts PULLING HERSELF up again.                                                                                        30.

                                      JONAS
                    You're right.  Don't show weakness
                    to a stranger.  People always look
                    for a way to exploit it, don't they?

      Jaime shoots him a look -- he's right about why she's not
      showing him her emotions, but she's not going to admit it.

                                      JAIME
                    I told Nurse Ratchett out there I
                    need to call my sister --

                                      JONAS
                    Your sister and coworkers think you've
                    gone on a trip with Eric -- minibreak
                    getaway, kind of thing.  Your neighbor
                    is taking care of Rebecca.

      Jaime has gotten to her feet now, putting a hand out to the
      wall to steady herself as she starts to WALK across the room --

                                      JAIME
                    You called my friends, my family? 
                    what gives you the right to call
                    anyone for me, much less lie to them?

                                      JONAS
                    It's not like anyone can know what
                    really happened, is it?  People get
                    killed for walking down the street
                    wearing a Rolex.  You, now, you're
                    carrying about 50 million dollars
                    worth of top secret experimental
                      technology inside you.

      Jaime looks at him sharply.  Is he serious?

                                      JAIME
                          (in disbelief)
                    Fifty --

                                      JONAS
                          (finishing the sentence)
                    -- million.  Non-refundable, I might
                    add, since the components have
                    tailored themselves to your DNA. 
                    It's not like I can just chop them
                    off and use them again.

                                      JAIME
                          (grim smile)
                    If you're talking about me paying
                    you back, that's gonna be one hell
                    of a layaway --

      Jonas shakes his head impatiently, she's missing the point.                                                                                        31.

                                      JONAS
                    What I'm talking about is how long
                    you'll last if anyone finds out. 
                    Ever.  I won't cut you up to find
                    out how bionics work.  But as for
                    the rest of the world...

      Jaime lets go of the wall, takes a step on her own.  And
      then another. 

                                      JAIME
                          ("cut the bullshit")
                    So you don't want to cut me up and
                    you don't want me to pay you back. 
                    What do you want, Mr. Bledsoe?

                                      JONAS
                    Your help.

      He goes to the door, opens it.  *

      INT. FACILITY CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

      Jaime runs one hand along the side of the wall for balance
      as she WALKS -- her balance and movement are almost NORMAL.

                                      JONAS
                    I started out a brat in Council
                    housing, and now I'm worth more than
                    the GDP of most small countries.

                                      JAIME
                          (unimpressed)
                    I've never heard of you.

                                      JONAS
                    And don't think that doesn't cost a
                    bloody fortune right there.  Point
                    is:  when you're so rich you can
                    have anything, what you want... can
                    change.  For better, or for worse.

                                      JAIME
                    There's only so many learjets you
                    can park in the garage?

                                      JONAS
                          (a quick grin)
                    Something like that. 
                          (more seriously)
                    I look at the world, and like everyone
                    else, I think what a mess it is --
                    but I have the means to do something
                    about it.  Make things better.*

      Jaime lets go of the wall, steps more and more CONFIDENTLY --
      until she's walking TOTALLY NORMALLY.                                                                                        32.

                                      JAIME
                    So how do you make the world "better?"

      Jonas reaches a door, sweeps a passkey over the sensor, as a
      SCANNER rakes over his eye.

                                      JONAS
                    Come in and find out.

      We hear the chunky LOCK disengage, the heavy door opens Jonas
      holds it, gesturing her through with a gentlemanly bow.

      INT. OPS CENTER -- DAY

      A darkened room, HUMMING with activity, this is the CENTRAL
      NERVOUS SYSTEM of Jonas' SPEC OPS DIVISION.  Computers,
      simulation boards, plotting maps, all the EQUIPMENT and STAFF
      you'd need to run SUPPORT for military operations.

                                      JONAS
                    This is a branch of my organization. 
                    The sharp end of the stick, you might
                    say. 

      At the center is a huge, complex bank of MONITORS.  A WOMAN
      sits at the controls, hands flying across the FIVE KEYBOARDS
      in front of her.  This is -- 

      RUTH TREADWELL, 50's, as tough as she is smart (which is
      saying something.) She radiates a kind of don't-fuck-with-me
      confidence that's sexy at any age.

      Along with ALL THE TECH STAFF, Ruth's eyes are fixed on the
      huge CENTRAL MONITOR that dominates the room -- the room is
      practically VIBRATING with TENSION.*

      Ruth glances away from her work to look to Jonas -- and PAUSES*
      at the sight of Jaime beside him.  She raises an eyebrow.

                                    RUTH
                          (softly)
                    Well, well.

      But Ruth can't spare any more time, she snaps back to her
      keyboards, her attention fixed on the MONITOR. 

                                    RUTH (CONT'D)
                    It's bad.  Two minutes behind schedule
                    and counting. 

      Jaime follows their gazes, looking up to the MONITOR --

      ON THE MONITOR, flickering black-and-white REMOTE FEED shows
      SIX GUYS in black fatigues in a MILITARY WEAPONS LAB.  SIGNS
      written in KOREAN are on the walls and door -- apparently
      the feed is being transmitted from Korea.                                                                                         33.

      Two STAND GUARD at the door, tense and SILENT;  TWO OTHERS
      are at the far exit, and the FINAL TWO are working on a large,
      CONICAL MACHINE, gun-metal gray, a PANEL open in the side. 

      ON JAIME as she STARES at the sinister conical shape, there's
      something FAMILIAR about that machine...

                                      JAIME
                          (in disbelief)
                    Is that... ?

                                      JONAS
                    A nuclear warhead.  They're
                      reprogramming it.

                                    RUTH
                          (tightly)
                    We hope.

      ON THE MONITOR, one of the SPEC OPS GUYS, BRETT ROLLINS, is
      deftly RECONNECTING wires inside the warhead.

                                      JONAS
                          (low, explaining)
                    Your standard issue unbalanced
                    dictator is about to test a nuclear
                    device -- that device.  If he
                    succeeds, and takes his country
                    nuclear, the whole region could go
                    up in smoke.  Governments all over
                    the world are trying to sanction
                    him, negotiated with him --
                            (dismissive)
                    Waste of time.

      ON THE MONITOR, a leanly muscled NAVAJO, DANNY ATCITTY, types
      rapidfire into a miniature console wired to the warhead's
      interior guts.  He works with terrifying FOCUS.

                                      JAIME
                          (sudden horror)
                    Wait -- tell me you're not about to 
                    blow up a head of state --

                                      JONAS
                    Don't be thick.  Assassination's
                      remarkably destabilizing. 
                      International uproar, everyone looking
                    for you afterwards, blah blah blah --
                    not worth the bother, really.

      ON THE MONITOR, one of the Guys turns from the door -- it's
      JAE, whom we last saw with Jonas.  Jae makes a sharp, urgent
      HAND SIGNAL to the others --                                                                                        34.

                                    RUTH
                          (urgently)
                    Jonas.  They're not going to make it --

      ON THE MONITOR, the door BLOWS OPEN in a BARRAGE of GUNFIRE,
      the noise OVERWHELMING after the tense silence.  GUARDS in
      KOREAN MILITARY UNIFORMS SWARM into the room -- 

      The Spec Ops Guys DIVE for cover, two are HIT immediately,
      going down -- the rest FIRE fast and accurate, TAKING OUT
      Military Guards left and right.  The FLASH of muzzle fire, 
      turns the monitor BLINDING WHITE, guns CRACK, people SHOUT --

      ON JAIME, horrified at watching the men DYING on the monitor
      right in front of her -- until -- 

                                      JONAS
                          (disgusted)
                    Oh for the love of -- shut it down.
                    Shut it down!

      ON THE MONITOR, the gunfire STOPS abruptly.  As the dust
      settles -- the Military Guards and Spec Ops Guys still
      standing reach down, HELPING UP the "dead" guys, who have
      SPLATTERED PAINT on them to show where they were "hit."  The
      Spec Ops Guys look deeply PISSED. 

      Ruth sighs, turns to Jaime, holding out her hand,
        straightforward, frank.

                                    RUTH
                    Ruth Treadwell.  Intel, logistics
                    and de facto den mother.  Nice to
                    meet you. 

      INT. TRAINING COMPLEX -- DAY

      The massive, hangar-like TRAINING COMPLEX, complete with
      FIRING RANGE, combat areas, climbing walls and various weapons
      training equipment, several WORKBENCHES -- and also --

      A MOCK-UP ROOM in the center of the hangar, door open to
      show the KOREAN WEAPONS LAB we saw on the monitor.  Covered
      with dust and paint splatters, the Spec Ops Guys are emerging
      from the room, Jae at their head, looking GRIM. 

                                    JAE
                          (to one of the Guys)
                    Shepherd, you missed the secondary
                    failsafe reset.  Again.  It set off
                    the interior alarms --

      RUTH, JONAS AND JAIME enter, head toward the Spec Ops Guys,
      Jaime looking around at the training equipment as they go.                                                                                        35.

                                      JAIME
                          (to Jonas)
                    So what we saw, that was just, what,
                    training?

                                      JONAS
                    Practice makes perfect.

                                    RUTH
                    It damned well better.  Real mission's
                    in ten days.

                                      JONAS
                    The boys are going to break in to
                    the Korean weapons lab and reprogram
                    the bomb -- and not a soul will know
                    they were there.  When test time
                    comes, instead of going "boom," the
                    bomb will just go kind of...
                      phffftttt.
                          (satisfied)
                    The humiliation and expense will be
                    huge.  Put our dictator friend right
                    off making more.  He'll stop his
                    nuclear program -- and think it's
                    his own idea.

      He's reached the Spec Ops Guys now, his grin fades. 

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                          (to the Guys, sarcastic)
                    Assuming we can actually do this
                    without getting caught, shot, or
                    setting the damned nuke off ourselves.

      Jae, meanwhile, has caught sight of JAIME.  He isn't happy.

                                    JAE
                          (warning)
                    Jonas --

                                      JONAS
                    Jaime Sommers, I'd like you to meet
                    my Spec Ops team.  Jae Kim, team
                    leader.  Hand to hand and tactics.

      The other Spec Ops Guys have ranged themselves loosely behind
      Jae.  They're looking Jaime over with a kind of stony
      DISTRUST.  Jonas IGNORES it, introduces them one by one.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    Daniel Atcitty: codes, ciphers and
                      cryptography.  Peter Maclaren: small
                    arms.  Brett Rollins: explosives and
                      munitions.  Neil Shepherd: breaking
                    and entering, infiltration, alarm
                    disabling --                                                                                        36.

      The next Guy, RADCLIFFE HARMON, a rangy TEXAN, speaks up:

                                      RADCLIFFE
                    Kinda arguable point just right now --

                                    NEIL
                            (automatically)
                    Shut up, Radcliffe.

                                      JONAS
                          (not missing a beat)
                    -- and Radcliffe Harmon, bladed
                    weapons.

                                      RADCLIFFE
                    And general hell-raisin'.
                          (verbal hat tip)
                    Ma'am. 

      Jaime looks a little HELPLESSLY at the battle-hardened
      SOLDIERS in front of her.

                                      JAIME
                    Um, hi.

                                    JAE
                    What is she doing here?

                                      JONAS
                      Hopefully, signing on.
                          (pointedly)
                    It's obvious we can use her. 

                                    JAE
                    Wait a minute -- 

                                      JAIME
                          (overlapping, alarmed)
                    What?  Signing on for what?

                                      JONAS
                    You have strength, speed and skills
                    that no one can match.  We need you. 
                    And I hear Korea's lovely this time
                    of year. 

                                      JAIME
                    You're joking, right?  You don't --
                    I can't do anything like that.  I
                    mean, it's ridiculous --

                                    RUTH
                    Actually, your onboard programming
                    has most major combat techniques,
                    including small arms and basic weapons
                    systems.                                                                                         37.

                                      JAIME
                    I'm sorry, did you just say
                      "programming?"

                                    RUTH
                    Didn't Masters go over the specs
                    with you?  It's all in your neural
                    interface hardware --
                          (off her blank look)
                    You know, the stuff he put in your
                    brain. 

      Jaime takes an involuntary step BACKWARDS.  She's SHAKEN to
      the core by the idea of something put into her brain.

                                      JAIME
                    You're wrong.  There's -- I'm not,
                    I've never even touched a gun, I
                    don't know how to fight --

      And without warning, Jae GRABS UP a PIPE WRENCH from the
      workbench next to them and SLAMS it right for Jaime's head.

      And what happens next just takes a HEARTBEAT.

      Faster than thought, Jaime BLOCKS the heavy wrench with her
      forearm, TWISTS her wrist expertly, GRABS the wrench -- and
      then SMASHES Jae down to the floor, raising the wrench --

      With a CLATTER, the SPEC OPS GUYS bring guns TO BEAR on Jaime --

                                      JONAS
                    Hold your fire!

      -- and Jaime STARTS, jarred out of her trance-like combat to
      find herself holding Jae down, wrench raised over him -- 
      about to BASH IN HIS HEAD.

      She FREEZES, their faces INCHES APART -- but Jae doesn't
      look afraid, he's just STARING at her with flat assessment.

                                    JAE
                          (hoarse whisper)
                    You gonna kill me, Sommers?

      Jaime JUMPS back, like his touch BURNS her.  Her hand CLENCHES
      the wrench, CRUSHING it with a SCREAM of protesting metal.

                                      JONAS
                          (furious, to Jae)
                    What the hell was that?

      Jae gets painfully to his feet, rubbing his bruised throat.

                                    JAE
                    Just making a point.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        38.

                                    JAE (CONT'D)
                          (to Jaime, ironic)
                    Nice disarm -- you do a lot of close-
                    quarters combat?

      Jaime LETS GO of the wrench, which drops heavily to the floor. 
      Ruth GLARES at Jae, then turns to Jaime, concerned.

                                    RUTH
                            (reassuring)
                    You're ok, all right?  You're
                      practically indestructible --
                          (nods toward Jae)
                    -- and he's a jerk.  You're ok.

      Jaime looks numbly down at her ARM -- not even BRUISED.

                                    RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Your bionic skin is a polyamide
                    composite that can withstand impact
                    pressures in excess of 10 tons psi,
                    and temperatures of over 500 degrees
                    Celsius.
                            (pragmatically)
                    Of course, the rest of your body
                    would be crushed into pulp and burned
                    to ashes... but Masters always had a
                    tendency to overdesign --

      Jaime backs to the door, it's all TOO MUCH, looks to Jonas:

                                      JAIME
                    I can't help you.  I can't.

      She turns and EXITS.  Jonas gives Jae an EXASPERATED look --

                                      JONAS
                    Bloody useless, you are.

                                    JAE
                    This is not a good idea, and you
                    know it --

                                    RUTH
                          (irritably)
                    Oh, zip it back up, both of you.

      INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

      Jaime hurries down the sterile corridor, looking one way,
      then another, like a rat desperate to exit a MAZE -- and she
      reaches a LARGE DOUBLE DOOR at the end of the hallway.

      She pulls on the doors -- they don't open -- and her
      frustration EXPLODES as she grabs one door and PUSHES with
      all her might.  The door holds for a second -- then BUCKLES
      outward, the locks SHEARING off as the door BURSTS OPEN --                                                                                        39.

      EXT. GROUNDS OUTSIDE COMPLEX -- DAY

      -- to reveal SUNLIGHT and TREES, the hilly terrain surrounding
      the complex.  Jaime STEPS OUTSIDE.

      INT. TRAINING COMPLEX -- DAY

      JONAS AND RUTH are looking at a security GRID on one of her
      monitors, Jae looking over their shoulders.

                                    RUTH
                    She's gone out E16, onto the grounds.

                                    JAE
                    She's totally untrained. I can get
                    close enough to tranq her --

                                      JONAS
                    No.
                          (to Ruth)
                    Keep the cameras on her, remote
                      surveillance only.  No one approaches. *

      EXT. GROUNDS OUTSIDE THE COMPLEX -- DAY

      Jaime turns her face to the sun, just FEELING the light and
      warmth on her -- then she starts to RUN.

      She skims over the rocky earth, ground FLYING beneath her
      feet, RUNNING through the dappled trees, going FASTER and
      FASTER.  There's something FIERCE and DESPERATE in her face.

      INT. TRAINING COMPLEX -- DAY

      JONAS, JAE and RUTH watching the IMAGES on the monitor:

                                    RUTH
                    She's picking up speed.
                          (checking readouts)
                    A lot of speed.

      EXT. GROUNDS OUTSIDE COMPLEX -- DAY

      JAIME goes FASTER -- VFX/SFX as we SHIFT into BIONIC RUNNING.

      Think the GRACE of "MATRIX" slowmotion, but INTERRUPTED by
      quick CUTS of Jaime RACING almost faster than the eye can
      follow -- a terrible sense of SPEED and POWER, as we see her
      FLASHING between the trees.

      INT. TRAINING COMPLEX -- DAY

                                    RUTH
                    Fifty miles an hour -- sixty --                                                                                        40.

      EXT. GROUNDS OUTSIDE COMPLEX -- DAY

      JAIME flashes over the uneven terrain, RACING faster, as if
      she's fleeing MONSTERS that only she can see --

      -- and in her face -- frightened, desperate, determined all
      at once -- we feel the ECHO of how she RAN when her parents
      died, RACING to get away from something that can't be escaped.

      INT. TRAINING COMPLEX -- DAY

                                    RUTH
                    Seventy -- eighty-five --

                                      JONAS
                    Jesus.

                                    RUTH
                    She's turning back toward the complex.

                                    JAE
                    Headed where?*

      INT. MEDICAL LAB -- DAY

      ERIC is working in a large MEDICAL LAB, totally ALONE --
      when the door BURSTS open from the other side, the heavy
      lock RIPPED away from the wall.  Jaime looks at Eric.*

                                      JAIME
                    I need to talk to you.

                                    ERIC
                    Are you ok?

                                      JAIME
                    "Ok?"  A few hours ago, I could barely
                    walk.  Now I'm faster than a speeding --
                    maybe not a bullet, but, you know,
                    at least a car -- I can crush steel --
                    and a few minutes ago, I nearly
                    murdered a man, before I even realized
                    what I was doing.
                          (bleak, desperate)
                    Eric -- I almost killed another human
                    being with my bare hands.

                                    ERIC
                    Jaime --

                                      JAIME
                    They said you put things in my brain. 
                    Is it true?  That you put something
                    inside me that taught me how to kill?

      Eric takes a deep breath.  Only the truth matters now.                                                                                        41.

                                    ERIC
                      I microscopically inserted several*
                    separate chips in different parts of*
                    your brain.  If I hadn't, you couldn't*
                    use your arm or legs --*

                                      JAIME
                    I don't need to mutilate people with
                    them!

                                    ERIC
                            (frustrated)
                    The technology was developed for
                    military applications, ok?  The combat
                    loading wasn't removable -- there
                    was no time! 
                          (admitting)
                    You're hardwired with the skills of
                      a soldier.

      Jaime can't quite believe what she's hearing.  She's beginning
      to doubt EVERYTHING she thought she knew about Eric.

                                      JAIME
                    Did you know?  That Bledsoe would
                    want me to work for him, to fight
                    people for him, to join the freaking
                      Testosterone Brigade?

                                    ERIC
                    I knew it was possible --
                          (earnestly)
                    -- but I didn't care.  I thought it
                    was a fair trade, for a life --

                                      JAIME
                    But you didn't trade your life.  You
                    traded mine.

      Jaime turns and walks out of the lab, leaving him ALONE.*

      INT. COMPLEX -- HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

      Jaime is in the hospital room, gathering her few things; 
      she opens a PLASTIC BAG by the bed, and dumps out HER
        BLOODSTAINED CLOTHES from the night of the accident, sliced
      into TATTERS where they were cut from her body.

      She looks down at them, harsh, undeniable PROOF of what
      happened to her.  She suddenly SPEAKS, without looking up:

                                      JAIME
                    Thanks for the new clothes.

      JONAS is standing in the door -- he comes into the room.                                                                                        42.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Mine are -- a little worse for wear.

      He holds out a sleek black cell phone.*

                                      JONAS
                    This will reach me, day or night,
                    anywhere in the world.  In case you
                      reconsider, about the job --

      Jaime looks at the cell phone, but doesn't take it.

                                      JAIME
                    I won't.

                                      JONAS
                    Then take it as a favor, so an old
                    man can get a decent night's sleep.

      Jaime considers -- then pockets the phone.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    Miss Sommers -- remember what I said. 
                    You can't tell anyone, anyone, what
                    happened to you.  You slip up even
                    once, the government is going to
                    come looking for you, and worse --
                    and so are my competitors.

                                      JAIME
                    Is that a threat?

                                      JONAS
                    It's a statement of fact.  Someone*
                    will find out, sooner or later --*
                    and they will come after you.  You,*
                    and anyone you love.  You have no*
                    idea what people are capable of.*

      Jaime hefts her bag, heads for the door.

                                      JAIME
                    I'll keep it in mind.

      She exits, leaving Jonas looking after her, WORRIED.  

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                        43.

                                            ACT FOUR

      EXT. JAIME'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

      A black SEDAN pulls up to Jaime's decrepit apartment building.
      She gets out, looks up at the building NERVOUSLY.

      INT. JAIME'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      Mrs. Arakelian is in the kitchen, boiling something in a POT
      with an alarming amount of STEAM coming out of it.  She turns
      as Jaime comes in, SMILES widely.*

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                    You had a good time with your
                      boyfriend, yes?  Such a nice young
                    man, that one, to send me money for
                    watching Rebecca -- I make him a
                    sweater!

      It's a little STRANGE for Jaime that everything here is so
      NORMAL -- as if NOTHING had happened at all.

                                      JAIME
                    So, um, how was Becca?

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                          (shrugging)
                    I don't let her pierce her nose.

      She comes over to give Jaime a HUG.

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry about her.  I am so glad
                    you take some time for yourself --

      She stops short, looking at Jaime piercingly.*

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN (CONT'D)
                          (quietly)
                    Ah.

      And there's no question, as strangely as she knew Jaime was
      pregnant, she now knows just as clearly that she's NOT.   
      In the awkward silence, Jaime tries to COVER.

                                      JAIME
                    It's all right.  Really.  It was
                    just -- you know, a false alarm.  I
                    wasn't really pregnant.  Everything's
                    fine.

      Mrs. Arakelian looks at her sympathetically, but there's a
      hint of CONFUSION as well.*

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                    Yes, this I can see.                                                                                        44.

      The DOOR bangs open, BECCA enters -- STOPS SHORT seeing Jaime.

                                      BECCA
                    Nice of you to drop by.

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN
                          (sighing)
                    So, I go home, make the sweater.

      She RUFFLES Becca's hair as she passes --

                                    MRS. ARAKELIAN (CONT'D)
                    Behave, crazy girl.

      She shuts the door behind her, Becca is already going into
      the kitchen, DROPPING her backpack on the floor.

                                      JAIME
                    Look -- I'm sorry I didn't tell you
                    I was going.  It wasn't on purpose.
                          (can't begin to explain)
                    Things just got, kind of, out of
                    hand --

      Becca comes out from the kitchen, coke in hand.

                                      BECCA
                    You know the thing that really gets
                    me?  You think I'm actually going to
                    buy this.  You take off without
                    telling me, someone else calls to
                    say you'll be gone --

      She gives Jaime a piercing look.

                                      BECCA (CONT'D)
                    You don't do stuff like that.  I
                    know it, you know it.  You never
                    have.

                                      JAIME
                    I'm sorry, Becca.

                                      BECCA
                    You want me to respect you?  Then
                    for once, treat me like you have
                    some respect for me.  I'm not a kid
                    anymore.  Tell me the truth.  What
                    the hell is going on?

      A long beat -- Becca's OPEN for the first time, if Jaime
      could just find the right thing to say.  But the one thing
      she can't do, is tell the truth.                                                                                        45.

                                      JAIME
                          (finally)
                    I -- I won't leave you like that
                    again.

      Becca TENSES.  Wrong answer.  She pushes past Jaime.

                                      BECCA
                    I've got homework to do.

      She exits, closing her door.  Jaime stands in the apartment,
      looking around like a STRANGER.  It feels like another PLANET.

      EXT. STARBUCK'S -- MORNING

      Jaime screeches the Pinto up to the Starbuck's -- late again. 
      The parking lot is PACKED, no spaces in front.

      She circles around BEHIND the shop.  The few parking spaces
      here are TAKEN here as well -- but of course, the PORSCHE is
      parked across two spaces, right next to a TOW AWAY ZONE.

      Jaime looks at her watch, getting more and more FRUSTRATED --  
      then stops the car, gets out, looks around.  There's no one
      nearby, the back wall of the coffeeshop hiding her.

      Jaime goes over to the Porsche, looks down at it for a moment --
      then takes her right arm, reaches under the bumper, and LIFTS.

      The front of the Porche RISES, Jaime lifting it as easily as
      if it were CARDBOARD.  She looks down in disbelief, GRINS --
      then PULLS the car out of the spaces, WHEELING it over to
      the TOW-AWAY ZONE and DROPPING it with a heavy THWUMMPP!

      INT. STARBUCK'S -- MORNING

      Jaime's behind the espresso machine while Maggie mans the
      register, taking ORDERS from a LONG LINE of people -- she
      hands Jaime a CUP, written on, then turns back to the customer --

                                      MAGGIE
                          (takes money)
                    Here's your change, sir.

      And before he's had time to put away his wallet, Jaime puts
      his COFFEE up on the counter.

                                      JAIME
                    Triple machiato decaf!

      QUICK CUTS of Maggie taking orders, Jaime FILLING them with
      almost DISTURBING speed, one cup, ANOTHER, ANOTHER -- THE
      RUSH HOUR LINE moving with almost BIZARRE efficiency --

      FINALLY, the line is GONE.  Maggie comes over to Jaime.                                                                                        46.

                                      MAGGIE
                    God, are you on something?

      Jaime looks down at her hand, a little GUILTY.

                                      JAIME*
                    What?  No!  Guess I just had one too
                    many lattes this morning --

                                      PORSCHE GUY (O.S.)
                          (impatiently)
                    Excuse me --

      They turn to see PPG at the counter, EMPTY CUP in hand.

                                      PORSCHE GUY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    -- I hate to interrupt Girls' Morning
                    Out, but I thought you two actually
                    worked here.  Can I get some service?

      Maggie rolls her eyes to Jaime, turns back to the counter.

                                      MAGGIE
                    Of course, sir, what can I get you?

      He holds up his cup, about to speak -- and Jaime INTERRUPTS:

                                      JAIME
                    Um, isn't that your car?

      She's pointing OUT A WINDOW -- where A TOW TRUCK is pulling
      out of the parking lot, the PORSCHE chained to its back.

                                      PORSCHE GUY
                          (yelling, outraged)
                    Hey!
                          (runs for the door)
                    That's my car!  That's my car!*

      He RACES out, Maggie and Jaime watching him go --

                                      MAGGIE
                          (considering, watching
                          PPG chase tow truck)
                    This is possibly our best workday
                    ever.

      When Jaime doesn't answer, Maggie looks back at her -- Jaime's
      STARING, Maggie follows her gaze to the DOOR, where --

      ERIC just entered, looking deeply WORRIED, almost SCARED.

      Maggie looks back and forth between the two of them.

                                      MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    Or, you know... not.                                                                                        47.

                                      JAIME
                          (to Maggie)
                    Can you cover for me?  Again?

      INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- TABLE BY WINDOW -- DAY

      A crowded RESTAURANT in CHINATOWN.  It's heavily decorated
      with paper lanterns, floor-to-ceiling shelves of CARVED
      FIGURES, various statues of BUDDHA and other BODHISATTVAS.*

      JAIME AND ERIC sit at a table in front of a huge plate-glass
      window overlooking the busy STREETS.  The tables around them
      are CROWDED with CHINESE PEOPLE speaking rapid CANTONESE.

      It's an ECHO of the earlier scene -- Jaime and Eric sitting
      across from each other, drinking tea in front of a window, 
      but the feeling couldn't be more DIFFERENT.

                                      JAIME
                    I know... I owe you everything.  I
                    do.
                          (wryly)
                    I'm not very good at it.  I've spent
                    my life avoiding relying on anyone. 
                    People always disappoint you.

                                    ERIC
                          (an edge of pain)
                    I don't want you to owe me.

      He pulls something out of his pocket, puts it on the table. 
      It's a small JEWELER'S BOX, grey, threadbare, very OLD.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    When we stopped at the house, before --
                    before we were --
                          (can't go on)
                    This is what I wanted to get.

      He opens the box -- there's an ANTIQUE ENGAGEMENT RING inside.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    It was my mother's.  I want it to be
                    yours.

      Jaime picks up the box, looks at the ring FLASH in the light.

                                      JAIME
                    You have another life, one I didn't
                    know anything about.  You lied to
                    me.  About everything.
                          (looks up at him)
                    I don't know you.

      She pushes the ring back across the table to him.                                                                                        48.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    And I can't marry a stranger.

      Before she can go on, Eric jumps in, rapid, almost FRANTIC -- 

                                    ERIC
                      I couldn't tell you the truth!  Jonas
                    let me do things in years that would
                    have taken decades in the medical
                      establishment -- but the price was
                    secrecy.  If I'd told you, it would
                    have put you in danger.
                          (fervent)
                    I'd do anything to keep you from
                    being hurt --

                                      JAIME
                    I know you would.  You already did.

      Eric pauses, surprised at the gentleness in her voice.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    You know, I was really angry at you. 
                    If you'd asked me yesterday, I would
                    have said I never wanted to see you
                    again.  But then... I had to lie to
                    Becca last night.  You're right. *
                    Sometimes you can't tell the truth. 
                    No matter how much you want to.

      She pushes the closed box back to him --

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    I don't want to marry a stranger --

      -- but she takes his hand in hers, the box forgotten.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    -- but I want to get to know you. 
                          (off his surprise)
                    I don't know who you are.  But right
                    now, I don't know who I am, either. 

      Eric is holding her hand like he's afraid she'll VANISH.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    So maybe we should try this whole
                    thing again.

                                    ERIC
                    Ask me anything.  Anything.

                                      JAIME
                    Actually, I sort of need to tell you
                      something.  I, um -- I picked up a
                    car.                                                                                        49.

                                    ERIC
                    You -- what?

                                      JAIME
                    I know, I know.  No one saw me.
                          (admitting)
                    It was kinda fun.

      Eric just looks at her for a beat -- then they both GRIN.

                                    ERIC
                    I'll bet it was.  You want to get
                    out of here?

                                      JAIME
                    Before I get fired?  Yeah.

      They stand up, still HOLDING HANDS, SILHOUETTED in the window --

      THE HUGE PLATE-GLASS WINDOW EXPLODES.

      ERIC goes FLYING backwards, as SHATTERED GLASS flies inward,
      a RAIN of cutting SHARDS hailing the restaurant, as

        THRACKK!THRACKK!THRACKK! rapidfire NOISE like THUNDERCRACKS --
      GUNSHOTS, tearing through the restaurant.

      A HUGE SHELF UNIT by the window TOPPLES ONTO ERIC, torn with
      BULLET HOLES from the back -- meanwhile THE REGISTER explodes
      in a GEYSER of cash and smoking electronics; PAPER LANTERNS
      ARE RIPPED TO SHREDS as SHOTS RAKE across the room; A STONE
      BUDDHA CRACKS, POCKED with bulletholes, TOPPLING to the floor.

      CHAOS as the CUSTOMERS PANIC, SCREAMING and RUNNING for the
      FIRE EXIT at the back as GUNSHOTS CRACK through the air --

      JAIME has DROPPED, scrambling low across the floor to get to

      ERIC, PINNED under the shelving -- DAZED, barely conscious --

      JAIME puts her hands beneath the huge bookcase -- and HEAVES
      it up, SHOVING it to the side with a CRASH.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Eric!

      THREE BULLET HOLES are drilled neatly into his chest,
      BLOSSOMING into BRIGHT RED STAINS across his shirt.  Jaime
      pulls him out, CRADLES him in her arms.  He COUGHS, wetly.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Hush, it's all right -- stay still --

      ANOTHER RIFLESHOT CRACKS across the restaurant, SHATTERING
      the large glass POULTRY CASE -- and                                                                                        50.

      JAIME turns INSTINCTIVELY, looking at the shattered case --
      and for the first time, her BIONIC EYE KICKS IN.

      POV JAIME, VFX as she sees a HEADS-UP COMBAT DISPLAY, info
      SCROLLING rapidly down the sides -- and the TRAJECTORY of
      the bullet superimposed in a GLOWING GREEN LINE.

      BACK ON JAIME as she almost FALLS backwards, DISORIENTED by
      the display -- but she quickly RECOVERS, keeping her hold on
      Eric as she instinctively looks BACK UP --

      POV JAIME, VFX as her eye FOLLOWS the TRAJECTORY LINE up
      into the ROOFTOPS of CHINATOWN -- her eye ZOOMS IN on the
      terminal point, THOUSANDS of yards away, MAGNIFYING --

      A RIFLE BARREL, sighting scope GLINTING in the sun, so DISTANT
      it would INVISIBLE to the naked eye -- and

      A WOMAN holds the rifle, pointing it DIRECTLY at the
      restaurant -- SARAH, the woman from the opening scene, perched
      atop an ABANDONED OFFICE BUILDING.

      She FIRES AGAIN.  The bionic eye TRACKS the bullet in a BLAZE
      of light like a CONTRAIL --

      JAIME DIVES hard the side, taking Eric with her, -- THE BULLET
      SPLINTERS the floor where they were a MOMENT before.

      INT. STOREROOM -- DAY

      Jaime BURSTS into the storeroom, carrying Eric -- she CRASHES
      into the wall, cans CLATTERING down around her as she CROUCHES
      down over Eric.  He looks up at her, gasping, breath hitching.

                                    ERIC
                    James...

                                      JAIME
                    It's ok -- you're going to be ok --
                          (shouting)
                    Help!  Someone help us!

      O.S. the RATTLE of GUNFIRE, hitting the restaurant AGAIN --
      the storeroom wall CRACKS from a shot on the other side.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    Please!  Somebody --

      Eric looks oddly PEACEFUL as he gazes up at her -- one hand
      reaches up to BRUSH her face --

                                    ERIC
                    ... I think... you're beautiful...

      His breathing is rapid, shallow.  BLOOD is pooling on the
      floor beneath him.  Jaime CLUTCHES him close --                                                                                        51.

                                      JAIME
                    It's all right.  Just hold on, ok?

      -- and reaches into her pocket, pulls out THE BLACK CELL
      PHONE that Jonas gave her.  She pushes CALL.  The phone RINGS*
      exactly ONCE.*

                                      JONAS
                    I'm here.

                                      JAIME
                    We need help.  Someone's shooting --
                    Eric -- he's hurt --

                                      JONAS
                    Ruth can track your position from
                    the phone.  I'll be there as fast as
                    I can.  Can you hold things down?

      And suddenly, something in Jaime's face CHANGES -- she's
      strangely CALM.  She knows she's going to have to FIGHT.

                                      JAIME
                    I can do that.

      She gently lowers Eric to the floor, as he meets her eyes.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    I'll be right back.

      EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- DAY

      JAIME darts out of the rubble of the restaurant -- she RACES
      behind another building, DISAPPEARING in a flash.

      EXT. ALLEYS -- DAY

      JAIME races through a MAZE of alleyways, to get BEHIND the
      OFFICE BUILDING where Sarah is STILL FIRING.

      Jaime looks around frantically -- the building TOWERS over
      her, the roof hopelessly high.  But Chinatown is a WARREN of
      buildings, all various heights -- Jaime glances at the several
      APARTMENTS and OFFICES surrounding Sarah's building --   
      and Jaime JUMPS STRAIGHT UP.

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOF -- DAY

      She FLIES through the air, LANDING with a THUMPP! on the
      lowest building, pausing only long enough to look to the
      next, JUMPING again --

      -- LEAPING across the rooftops with feline grace, to get to
      the ABANDONED OFFICE BUILDING.                                                                                        52.

      EXT. ABANDONED OFFICE BUILDING ROOF -- DAY

      SARAH is perched at the edge of the roof, sighting down the
      sniper rifle for another shot -- when THUMPPP! something
      LANDS on the roof behind her.  She WHIRLS --

      JAIME CRASHES into her full-force --

      SARAH goes FLYING, skidding on the pebbled roof, rifle SAILING
      off the roof, as

      JAIME sweeps up a piece of REBAR, STRIDES toward Sarah like
      the wrath of god itself --

      SARAH rolls instantly to her feet, crouched to ATTACK, as --

      JAIME HURLS the rebar like a javelin -- and THWACKK! the
      metal bar TEARS into Sarah's arm like an ARROW, JERKING her
      backwards to SLAM her against the roof stairway access --

      -- leaving Sarah IMPALED her through the UPPER ARM into the
      crumbling brick of the roof access.  PINNED like an insect.

                                      JAIME
                          (evenly)
                    I'm sorry.  I didn't want to hurt
                    you.  But I had to stop you --

      And unbelievably, Sarah SMILES -- not a hint of pain, she
      actually looks strangely AMUSED.  It's CHILLING.

                                      SARAH
                    Never apologize for success.

      Sarah FIXES her gaze on Jaime, never taking her eyes off her
      as she reaches across with her free hand -- and RIPS the
      rebar out of her arm with a GRUNT of pain, FREEING herself.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    No matter what the cost.

      Jaime stares in disbelief -- BLUE-WHITE BLOOD pulses from
      the GASH in Sarah's arm.  Bionic blood.

      Sarah MOVES slowly toward Jaime, like a STALKING PANTHER,
      swinging the rebar in one hand as she looks her up and down.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Well, well... isn't this interesting.
                          (a wicked grin)
                    Let's see what you've got under the
                    hood.

      Sarah FLINGS the rebar aside and CHARGES.  She's INCREDIBLY
      FAST, punching and kicking -- Jaime barely blocks.                                                                                        53.

      Sarah SWEEPS a kick, Jaime's feet fly out from under her,*
      Sarah PUNCHES her hard in the stomach -- and*

      JAIME goes FLYING, SLAMS hard into the roof access, FALLING*
      to her knees.  Sarah STRIDES up after her.*

      TIGHT ON JAIME'S FACE, bleeding, breath RASPING --*

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                          (curious, pleasant)
                    Who are you?

      -- and we're back to the OPENING SCENE.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Or maybe I should be asking... what
                    are you?

      Sarah KICKS Jaime in the stomach, almost casually.  Jaime
      CURLS in on herself, biting off the urge to SCREAM.

      Jaime rolls painfully onto her hands and knees, wind whipping
      her hair across her face -- then LOOKS UP, eyes fixing on
      Sarah, not in pain or fear, but DEFIANCE.

                                      JAIME
                          (gasping for breath)
                    Shouldn't I -- be asking -- you?

      Sarah GRABS Jaime by the hair and JERKS her to her feet,
      STARES her in the eye, inches apart.

                                      SARAH
                          (like a dare)
                    So ask.

      Jaime STARES right back at her, a CHALLENGE:

                                      JAIME
                    Who the hell are you?

      Sarah's answer is a GHOST OF A SMILE -- and she raises her
      arm to BACKHAND Jaime.  Her bladed hand comes WHISTLING down --

      -- sending Jaime FLYING to the very edge of the roof, SKIDDING
      up against the concrete lip.

                                      SARAH
                    My name is Sarah Peregrine.

      Sarah picks up the rebar, striding toward Jaime's crumpled
      form, wind WHIPPING the hair back from her face.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I'm the first bionic woman.

                                    END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                        54.

                                            ACT FIVE

      EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

      JAIME lies crumpled at the edge of the roof, back against
      the narrow concrete lip -- O.S. SIRENS, coming RAPIDLY CLOSER.

      SARAH strides toward her, rebar in hand, MURDER in her eyes.

                                      SARAH
                    I think one of us is more than enough. 

      JAIME is CORNERED, she glances desperately DOWN --

      VFX BIONIC EYE as Jaime spots THE SNIPER RIFLE she knocked
      from Sarah's hand, lying where it fell on a roof far below.

      Jaime has only an INSTANT to decide, Sarah's almost on her --*
      and Jaime ROLLS off the roof, FALLING into OPEN AIR.*

      EXT. LOWER ROOFTOP -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

      Jaime HURTLES downward, TWISTS painfully in midair --

      -- and lands THRUMMP! unsteadily on her legs on the lower*
      roof, hand SHOOTING OUT to SWEEP the rifle up, WHIRLING around*
      with the rifle to her SHOULDER to sight on Sarah --

      VFX BIONIC EYE, looking up -- Sarah has vanished.

      Jaime turns, looks down -- to see an AMBULANCE pulling up to
      the restaurant below, SIRENS BLARING.

      INT. OBSERVATION DECK OVER O.R. -- DAY

      JAIME sits, a PAD OF PAPER and PENCIL in hand, SKETCHING*
      with shocking speed -- her right hand BLURS over the paper,*
      moving without hesitation or pause. *

      THROUGH THE GLASS, Eric is visible on the table, surgeons
      and nurses SWARMED around him.

      JONAS enters; his usual cheerful attitude is totally GONE,
      replaced with GRIM FOCUS. 

                                      JONAS
                    They're operating on him, trying to
                    stop the bleeding, remove the bullets.

                                      JAIME
                          (savagely)
                    Fix it.

                                      JONAS
                    It's not that simple --                                                                                        55.

                                      JAIME
                    Yes it is!
                            (escalating, angry)
                    You saved me -- save him --

      Jonas' voice RISES, MATCHING her frustration, trying to get
      her to UNDERSTAND:

                                      JONAS
                    I didn't save you!  Eric did!
                          (as Jaime stops short)
                    No one can do what he does.  No one.

      Jaime waits for a beat as it sinks in, then turns the pad*
      around, to show him her SKETCH --*

      CLOSE ON THE DRAWING, showing SARAH as she looked STRIDING*
      toward Jaime on the roof, DEATH in her eyes.  EVERYTHING is*
      drawn in perfect, eerie detail, like a SNAPSHOT.*

                                      JAIME*
                    I can't draw.*

                                      JONAS*
                    Your eye stores visual information*
                    in a matrix that your hand can access*
                    and reproduce.  For all intents and*
                    purposes, you have an eidetic memory --*

                                      JAIME*
                            (interrupting)*
                    Who is she?

      INT. BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY

      CLOSE ON SARAH'S FACE -- cleanly beautiful, hard planes and
      strong lines, the face of a mesmerizing, merciless PREDATOR.

                                      JONAS (O.S.)
                    Sarah Peregrine worked for me.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're looking at --

      A LIFESIZE 3D HOLOGRAM OF SARAH, looking REAL as flesh, but
      FROZEN in a single moment, staring, intense.

                                      JONAS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    She was a soldier.  One of the best
                    I've ever seen.

      The hologram stands in the center of a BRIEFING ROOM, over
      glowing PROJECTION CIRCLE on the floor.

                                      JONAS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Tactics, combat, infiltration,
                      logistics, even military R&D --                                                                                        56.

      JONAS, JAE, RUTH and JAIME sit at the semicircular CONFERENCE
      TABLE that wraps halfway around the projection circle.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    -- the girl was a born warrior.

      FLATSCREENS cover the entire wall BEHIND the circle, showing
      a CHANGING array of PICTURES and INFORMATION, all about SARAH.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    So when Eric finished the prototype,
                    I wasn't surprised when she
                      volunteered.

      Jaime tears her gaze from HoloSarah back to Jonas.

                                      JAIME
                          (shocked)
                      Volunteered?  To be -- to let him --

                                      JONAS
                    It was --
                          (stops, tries again)
                    I should have said no.

                                    JAE
                          (flat, emotionless)
                    But you didn't.

      There's TENSION between them, something SIMMERING and too
      long unsaid, but Jaime doesn't have time for their past drama.

                                      JAIME
                    What happened?

      Ruth TAPS at the KEYBOARD embedded in the table.

      HOLOSARAH becomes SEMI-TRANSPARENT -- like an ANATOMICAL
      DIAGRAM, showing Sarah's heart, blood vessels, organs,
      overlaid with layers of muscles and tendons and nerves --

                                      JONAS
                    She became strong, fast, utterly
                    lethal.

      -- AND WE CAN SEE HER BIONICS.  BOTH LEGS, BOTH ARMS, and
      ONE EYE in shades of BRIGHT BLUE and GREEN and STARK WHITE.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    Something of a one-woman army.

      Tiny flows of MERCURY-LIKE QUICKSILVER race from the bionics
      to the organic body and back, DARTING like lightning,
        INTERTWINING the human and machine -- and congregating in --                                                                                        57.

      THE BRAIN, which SPARKLES with racing quicksilver in a
      shimmering WEBWORK, extending from several tiny SILVER NEXUSES
      implanted in various spots.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    She was the best operative I had. 
                      Brilliant.  Fearless. Unstoppable.

      Jaime has gotten up from her chair, eyes fixed on HoloSarah,
      approaching the unmoving figure with a kind of FASCINATION.

      Jaime STOPS, face to face with HoloSarah, eyes on the webwork
      in Sarah's brain like she's looking at a terrible MIRROR.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    And then... she went insane.

      At that moment, HoloSarah SOLIDIFIES again, and Jaime's EYE
      TO EYE with a perfect replica of SARAH, STARING at her.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    She went rogue.  Vanished.

                                    JAE*
                    Now she's a mercenary and an assassin,*
                    for sale to the highest bidder.*

                                      JAIME*
                          (turns back to them)
                    Why would she want to hurt Eric?*

                                      RUTH*
                    Turns out, your car accident wasn't*
                      accidental at all.  We were misled,*
                    pretty damn brilliantly, by the body
                    of what looked like a drunken driver
                    in the car that hit you.  Except his
                    neck was broken before the crash.

                                    JAE
                    This wasn't the first attempt on Eric.  It
                    was the second. He was the target all along. 

                                      JONAS
                    And apparently, he still is.

      Jaime gives Jonas a look that could freeze ice.

                                      JAIME
                    All this is your fault.

                                      JONAS
                    Me?  I'd never let anything happen
                    to Eric! He's like a son to me --                                                                                        58.

                                      JAIME
                    And like you said -- without him,
                    there are no bionics.

      Jonas looks like he wants to HIT her, but instead just BITES
      OFF his words, hard and cold:

                                      JONAS
                    Think what you like about me.  But
                    Sarah is out there.  And I need your
                    help.

                                      JAIME
                    What, because "this time it's
                      personal?"

                                      JONAS
                    Every mission is personal, for me.

                                      JAIME
                    You used Eric, and you want to use
                    me, and I'm telling you:  it's done.

      She EXITS without looking back.  Jonas sighs, steeples his
      fingers, looking down -- then, without looking up:

                                      JONAS
                    Do it.

                                    RUTH
                            (protesting)
                      Goddammit, Jonas --

      Jonas' head snaps up, his voice like a WHIPCRACK.

                                      JONAS
                    It's not a request, Treadwell.  Run
                    the sim. 

      Jonas exits, going after Jaime. 

      INT. OBSERVATION DECK OVER O.R. -- DAY

      Hours later.  Jaime is ASLEEP, draped over one of the chairs.
      A hand comes into frame, touching her gently on the shoulder.

      Jaime opens her eyes blearily, looks up to see --

      SARAH standing over her, all in BLACK.

                                      SARAH
                    He's mine now, bitch.

      She GRINS, feral and horrible, teeth laced with BLOOD --

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:                                                                                        59.

      INT. OBSERVATION DECK OVER O.R. -- DAY

      JAIME comes GASPING awake, a HAND on her shoulder -- JONAS.  

                                      JONAS
                    Jaime!  It's all right -- you were
                    dreaming --

      Jaime jumps to her feet, looks at the O.R. below -- EMPTY.

                                      JAIME
                    Where is he?*

      INT. ELEVATOR -- DAY

      Jonas and Jaime in the elevator, going DOWN.

                                      JONAS
                    I've instituted special security
                      protocols.  He's in lockdown; he
                    won't leave the complex until Sarah's
                    been -- neutralized. *

      Jaime looks UNNERVED, nightmare still ECHOING in her mind.

      INT. LOCKDOWN ROOM -- NIGHT

      A darkened, windowless room, a HOSPITAL BED against the wall. 
      ERIC lies on the bed, chest BANDAGED, face pale and DRAWN. 
      MONITORS beep, IV's are in both his arms, O2 tube beneath
      his nose.  Jaime comes up to him, gently takes his hand -- 

                                    ERIC
                          (smiling weakly)
                    Hey.

                                      JAIME
                    I thought -- I thought you --

      Eric's voice is hoarse, he's WEAK, blurry from the surgery --

                                    ERIC
                    Yeah, I know what that's like.
                          (feeble grin)
                    Sucks, huh?*

      His smile FADES as he he reaches up WEAKLY, pulls her close,
      his tone URGENT:

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    She won't stop.

      He's fighting to stay conscious, every word a STRUGGLE.                                                                                        60.

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    I know Sarah -- when she starts
                      something, she never stops.  She'll
                    keep coming back, until I'm dead. 
                    And then -- she'll come after you.

                                      JAIME
                    Me?  Why?

                                    ERIC
                    She knows what you are, now.

      Eric holds her hand TIGHT, looks up with frantic INTENSITY:

                                    ERIC (CONT'D)
                    Stop her, Jaime.  Stop her.

      INT. OPS CENTER -- DAY

      Jaime comes into the Ops Center.  Jonas is bent over the*
      central displays with Ruth, he looks up to see Jaime enter --*

                    I'll do it.*

      JAE AND THE TEAM have just entered -- Jae sees the look*
      between Jaime and Jonas, UNDERSTANDS instantly.*

                                    JAE
                          (under his breath)
                    Great.

                                    RUTH
                    Gather 'round, boys.  Looks like we
                    may have gotten lucky.

                    Sarah left behind a fragment of soil
                    that doesn't match the roof gravel.

      ONSCREEN, a SCHEMATIC of the rooftop Sarah fired from,
      ROTATING to close in on an area no more than a square INCH --

                                    RUTH (CONT'D)
                    The soil composition is unusual --*
                    high levels of arsenic and lead with
                    a chaser of diesel residue.  Then,
                    on top of that, I found polyamide
                    shavings.  And there you are!

      BLANK LOOKS from the Team, Jonas and Jaime.

                    Arsenic, lead, diesel -- don't you
                    people read?                                                                                        61.

                    Oh, for --
                            (explaining)
                    In 1906, after the earthquake --
                    we've heard of the earthquake, right?  --
                    the city bulldozed the wreckage for
                    landfill to make the wharf.  Building
                    materials of the period used high
                    levels of --*

                                      JONAS

                                    RUTH
                    And in 1990, a tank rupture saturated*
                    ten blocks there -- with diesel.*

      She pulls up a MAP of the BAY ala GOOGLE EARTH -- the bird's-
      eye HURTLES down on an AREA of WAREHOUSES crowded cheek-to-
      jowl in a heavy INDUSTRIAL AREA of the shipping wharf.

                                    JAE
                            (doubtfully)
                    That's still a lot of ground to cover. 

                                    RUTH
                    Am I talking to myself?  Did no one
                    hear me say "polyamide?"  Translation: 
                    tiny little bits of bionic skin?

                                      JONAS
                    You think she's injured?  Damaged?

                                    RUTH
                    Don't know.  But I went looking for
                    the kind of equipment you'd need if
                    you had to do, say, bionic repairs
                    in the field, cross-referenced with
                    addresses in the wharf.

      A LIST of shipping bills appears, one window after another,

                                    RUTH (CONT'D)
                    Different companies, different names --
                    but all delivered to the same address.

                                    RUTH
                    I'll need a few hours to run the
                    combat sims.  No more.

                                    JAE
                    We won't move until after dark,
                    anyway.  I'll send a reconn team,
                    establish a surveillance perimeter.

                                      JAIME
                    Yeah, and I need to pick Becca up
                    from school and get a sitter.

      EVERYONE turns to look at her.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)*
                    What?*

      EXT. BECCA'S SCHOOL -- DAY

      Jaime pulls up LATE -- the school is practically EMPTY, no
      one out front but a kids straggling from late BAND PRACTICE.

                                      JAIME
                    Hey, have you seen Becca Sommers?

      INT. MUSTANG -- DAY

      BECCA is in a parked car with a fairly lowlife-looking senior,
      JASON.  They're MAKING OUT with almost ANGRY enthusiasm. 
      The door FLIES open -- Becca and Jason almost FALL OUT, facing
      A VERY PISSED-OFF JAIME.

                                      JAIME
                          (to Becca, furious)
                    Get. In.  The.  Car.

      Becca gives her a look of pure DISGUST.  They're in the
      PARKING LOT in the back of the school, almost EMPTY.  Becca
      heads over to the Pinto.

      Jaime looks down at Jason;  he hasn't moved from the driver's
      seat.  He seems totally unconcerned.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    I don't like you spending time with
                    my sister.

                                      JASON
                          (starts the car)
                    Then I guess you got yourself a
                    problem.

      He GUNS the motor -- but Jaime leans down, grabbing the
      steering wheel with one hand before he can SHIFT into gear.                                                                                        63.

                                      JAIME
                    You think?

      With a SQEAL of metal, Jaime BENDS the steering column down.
      Jason barely has time to be SHOCKED as the steering wheel
      comes down to PIN him to the seat -- right across his crotch.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                          (sweetly)
                    Touch my sister again -- and next
                    time, it won't be your car.

      Jaime turns and STRIDES off, leaving Jason SPEECHLESS with
      disbelief -- he starts STRUGGLING to get out, but he's STUCK.

      INT. JAIME'S APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

      Late afternoon sun slants through the windows as Jaime and
      Becca enter the apartment in a TENSE SILENCE. 

                                      JAIME
                    Look, I have to go out tonight. 
                    I'll get Mrs. A to stay with you --

                                      BECCA
                    You are the single most embarrasing
                    human being on the planet, you know
                    that?!  How could you -- *

      Jaime's BLACK CELL PHONE RINGS.*

                                      JAIME*
                    I have to take this --*

      Jaime picks up -- and Becca STALKS OFF furiously.*

                                      JONAS*
                    We're go for tonight.  I'll send*
                      transport.  You ready?*

      O.S. Becca's door SLAMMING dramatically.*

                                      JAIME*
                    Sure.  Right now, a secret mission*
                    to bring down a bionic psychopath is
                    looking comparitively low stress.

      INT. LOCKDOWN ROOM -- NIGHT**

      Jaime enters, in the black fatigues of the Spec Ops Team. *

                                    ERIC
                          (sees her fatigues)
                    You're going with them?

      Jaime nods, comes closer to the bed.                                                                                        64.

                                      JAIME
                    You didn't tell me about Sarah.  

                                    ERIC
                    I didn't know how... to tell you
                    that the technology I'd used to save
                    you might -- might hurt you.

                                      JAIME
                          (steels herself)
                    Will I become like her?

                                    ERIC
                    I don't know.  No one knows.
                          (shakes his head)
                    I really screwed up, Jaime.  All I
                    could think about was losing you --
                          (voice catching)
                    It matters.  If you can forgive me.

      She kisses him on the forehead, leans her head against his.

                                      JAIME*
                    There's nothing to forgive. *

      INT. COMPLEX -- LOADOUT DOCK -- NIGHT**

      JAIME enters the LOADOUT AREA.  THE TEAM is strapping on*
      their gear, loading a BLACK VAN.  They're armed to the TEETH. *
      Jaime starts to reach for a 9mm -- and a HAND comes over*
      hers, stopping her.  It's JAE.*

                                    JAE*
                    No firearm.*

                                      JAIME
                          (low)
                    You want to tell me what your problem
                    is?

                                    JAE
                    Last time I had one like you on this
                    team, three of my people died.  She
                    killed them.
                          (turns back to her)
                    We work as a team because of two
                    things:  skill and trust.  You have
                    skills.  But you can't be trusted.  
                    You're a ticking bomb.  It's only a
                    matter of time until you lose it.

      Jaime doesn't back down an inch.

                                      JAIME*
                    You don't know anything about me.*

                                    JAE*
                    I know this:  one step over the line,*
                    and I will put you down.*
                          (loud, to the Team)
                    Let's move out!

                                    END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                        65.

      EXT. STREETS NEAR WHARF -- NIGHT

      The van drives through the WAREHOUSE DISTRICT, old hulking
      buildings RISING in the dark around them like RUINS of some
      ancient, forgotten city.

      INT. VAN DRIVING ON STREET -- NIGHT

      The van is outfitted with MONITORS and SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT. 
      DANNY mans the communications console;  one monitor shows
      JONAS on WEBCAM;  another a SCHEMATIC of the warehouse.

                                    JAE
                      Surveillance hasn't seen anyone come
                    in or out of the warehouse but her. 
                          (points to schematic)
                    Access points are here, here, and
                    here.  Shepherd and Mac take the
                    back door, Radcliffe and Danny will
                    go through the loading dock --

                                      DANNY
                    Why do I always get Brokeback over
                    here?

                    That ain't funny -- I told you, those
                    guys were from Wyoming --

                      Radcliffe.  Shut up.

                                    JAE
                          (not missing a beat)
                    -- Brett and I will come in through
                    the front.
                          (to Jaime)
                    You're with me.

                    Can I at least have a gun?*

                    No.*

                          (exasperated)
                    So what am I supposed to do?

                                    NEIL
                            (suggesting)
                    She could break down the door.
                          (to Jaime)
                    I hear you're good at that --                                                                                        66.

                    got, including Jaime, to disable her
                    and bring her back to base, alive.

      The men look at each other, all thinking the same thing.

                                    MAC
                    And in the unlikely event the
                      "disabling" goes south?

                                    JAE
                          (promptly)
                    Put her down.  Just like you would
                    any other mad dog.

      All eyes turn to JONAS on the monitor; he NODS, tersely.

                                      JONAS
                    Do what you have to do.

      Off Jaime, clearly WONDERING if they'd do the same to her.

      EXT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

      The Van PARKS behind a building.  The SPEC OPS GUYS emerge
      SILENTLY, blending with the surrounding shadows. They all
      wear EARBUDS and THROAT MIKES with their gear.

      POV JAIME, VFX BIONIC EYE, as she looks THROUGH THE DIRTY
      WINDOW that fronts the warehouse -- inside, BLURRED by dust
      and grime on the pane, she sees SARAH sitting at a workbench.

      VFX BIONIC EYE ZOOMING IN -- Sarah has ONE ARM stretched in*
      front of her, using a small ARC WELDER on her inner arm.*

                                    JAE
                          (into throat mike)
                    Control, target sighted.

      INT. OPS CENTER -- NIGHT

      JONAS AND RUTH watch video monitors showing LIVE FEEDS from*
      the Spec Ops Guys' eyegear.*

                                    RUTH
                    Roger that.  We see her.  Looks like
                    the repair scenario was right.  Maybe 
                    her combat function is impaired.

      EXT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

      Jae CLICKS OFF the safety on his 9mm.                                                                                        67.

                                    JAE
                    I'm not counting on it.

      Jaime follows Jae and Brett toward the front of the warehouse. 
      The building looks ABANDONED, the walls cracked and worn. 
      JAE kneels at the LOCK on the door, starts PICKING it.

      AT THE LOADING DOCK, RADCLIFFE CLIPS the heavy lock;       *
      AT THE BACK DOOR, SHEPHERD expertly PICKS the lock in seconds. *
      BACK AT THE FRONT, JAE is still trying to get the lock open.*

                                      DANNY (O.S.)
                    Team B in position.  Loading dock
                    clear.  We're good to go.

      Brett looks down at Jae, impatiently, Jae can't get the lock --

                                    MAC (O.S.)
                    Team C in position.  East door clear. 
                    Good to go. 

      SCOWLING, Jae moves aside from the door.

                                    JAE
                            (whispering, not happy)
                    Sommers.  Do it.
                          (into headset)
                    On my mark, people.  Three -- two --
                    one -- mark.

      And with shocking grace, Jaime BACK SPIN-KICKS the lock,
      PULVERIZING it, sending the metal doors FLYING inwards.

      INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

      JAE AND BRETT CHARGE into the warehouse -- at the same moment

      THE OTHER FOUR SPEC OPS GUYS converge three sides on SARAH,
      who hasn't moved an INCH.  They surround her in a loose
      circle, guns TRAINED unwaveringly on her.

      JAE moves toward Sarah, his gun pointed levelly at her head. 

                                    JAE
                    Give it up.  It's over.

      Sarah finally looks up at him -- her eyes GLITTER in the
      harsh leaping light of the welder as she looks at Jae like
      there's ONLY THE TWO OF THEM in the room. 

                                      SARAH
                    I keep telling you, Jae:  it's never
                    over.  Even when you want it to be.

      She looks PAST Jae, straight at JAIME -- and Sarah SMILES,
      feral, COLD, just like in Jaime's dream.                                                                                        68.*

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Hello again.

      INT. COMPLEX -- OPS CENTER -- NIGHT

      RUTH, JONAS AND OPERATIONS TECHS in the Ops Center.  Ruth's
      monitors suddenly go DARK, feeds VANISHING.

                                    RUTH
                    I've lost signal.  They're offline --

                                      JONAS
                    What?  Get them back!

                                    COMM TECH*
                    We've lost the surveillance feed. *
                    We're being jammed.*

                                    RUTH
                          (realizing, grimly)
                    She knew we were coming.

      INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

      Back to SARAH AND THE TEAM, still in the same positions --

      -- when suddenly FIGURES come CROWDING in the doors from
      outside -- THUGS, HEAVILY ARMED, SWARM into the warehouse,
      bring their guns with a CLATTER to bear on THE TEAM. 

      So now it looks like this: A CIRCLE OF THUGS in the shadows,*
      surrounding THE CIRCLE OF SPEC OPS GUYS, and SARAH in the*
      center of it all, still working nonchalantly on the weld.*

                                      SARAH
                    You ought to know I don't leave so
                    much as a molecule behind.  Unless I
                    mean to.*

      Jae keeps his gun TRAINED on Sarah, rock-steady, but TENSION*
      radiates from him almost VISIBLY. *

                                    JAE*
                    What the hell is this?*

                                      SARAH*
                    An invitation.  I'm building my own*
                      organization, something that will*
                    show Jonas for the amateur he is. *
                          (to the Team)*
                    And I'm hiring.  Interested?*

                                    JAE*
                    Step away from the table and put*
                    your hands where I can see them. *                                                                                        69.*

                                      SARAH*
                          (ignoring the order)*
                    Applying is simple:  strip down and*
                    fight me. *
                          (nods at the Thugs)*
                    They'll tell you -- you can't beat*
                    me.  But last long enough before I*
                    take you down, and the job is yours.*
                          (small smile)*
                    Although one of you already works*
                    for me.*

                                    JAE*
                          (eyes on Sarah)*
                    Brett, cover Sommers!*

                                      JAIME*
                    What?*

                                    JAE*
                          (to Sarah, deadly)*
                    Call off your men, get up and come*
                    with us, or I'll put a bullet through*
                    your head.  I swear to god I will.*

      Sarah finishes sealing her arm, looks up at Jae. *

                                      SARAH*
                    I know you would.*

      KER-BLAMMM!  The shot blasts through the tense silence -- as*
      JAE SPINS, falls to his knees, SHOT in the shoulder.  BRETT*
      stands behind him, gun in hand. *

                                      BRETT*
                    I'm giving my notice.*
                          (to the Team)*
                    Sorry, guys.  I got a better offer --*

      -- but before he can finish, Jae TWISTS, legs SCISSORING
      out, KNOCKING Brett to the ground, his gun FLYING --

      AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE as everyone starts SHOOTING.

                                      SARAH
                          (shouting)
                    I want them alive!

      Sarah JUMPS up from the workbench, welder in hand --

      -- and she SLAMS into Jaime with the force of a FREIGHT TRAIN. 
      Jaime goes FLYING into a wall, CRASHING right through it -- 

      INT. WAREHOUSE WORKSHOP -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

      -- to SLAM into a stainless steel TABLE, sending SURGICAL
      EQUIPMENT scattering in every direction.                                                                                        70.*

      She's in a SMALL ROOM off the main warehouse, which has been
      made into --

      A MACABRE WORKSHOP filled with BIONIC PARTS and TOOLS. 

      A cross between an OPERATING ROOM and a MACHINE SHOP: drills*
      and welders beside organic-looking REPLACEMENT PARTS of white*
      tubing, titanium-ceramic bones, polyamide skin, I.V. bags of*
      blue-white BIONIC BLOOD and countless FRAGMENTARY PARTS.*

      SARAH LEAPS through the rent-open wall -- she RAKES across
      Jaime's arm with the welder, the bionic skin TEARING open.

                                      SARAH
                    You know, you really suck at this.

      She SWEEPS a kick out, KNOCKING Jaime back, then SLAMS her
      down to the floor, knee over her throat --

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)*
                    Show me yours, I'll show you mine. *
                    What did they replace?*

      Sarah PRESSES on her throat --*

                                      JAIME
                    My right arm! 
                          (gasps for breath)
                    Both legs -- my eye, and -- my ear.

      She RISES gracefully off Jaime, regards her for a second --
      then STRIKES her with the steel bar in the stomach.

                                      SARAH
                    Me, they did both arms, both legs. *
                    Only one eye, though -- Masters wasn't
                    sure about the optic interface. 
                          (shrugs)
                    So I did the other one myself.

      Even through the haze of pain, Jaime looks up sharply --

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)*
                    Part of my chest too. *
                          (off Jaime's shock)*
                    I'm cutting away all the parts of me*
                    that are weak.  And getting rid of*
                    anything in my way.  Like Masters --*

                                      JAIME*
                    No!*

      Jaime marshalls every OUNCE of strength, THROWS herself at
      Sarah --

                                      SARAH
                    You still don't understand.                                                                                        71.

      Sarah SLAMS Jaime back against the wall. 

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You're already dead.

      SARAH'S fist BLURS right for Jaime's FACE -- JAIME ROLLS to
      the side the instant before impact.  Sarah's hand SMASHES
      into the wall, PUNCHING a hole through it.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You were dead from the moment they
                    put this junk inside you, raped your
                    brain and made you what they wanted.

      She JERKS her hand from the wall, STRIDES toward Jaime. 

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    We both were.

      Sarah SLAMS Jaime against a STEEL-BARRED WINDOW, glass RAINING
      around them as she SHOVES Jaime against the bars --

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    What the hell is wrong with you? 
                    You knew, they all knew --
                          (furiously)
                    How could you let them do this to
                    you?

      Jaime SNARLS right back at her, face to face --

                                      JAIME
                    I didn't let anybody do anything,
                    all right?  You missed Eric with the
                    car, and you got me.  I'm no soldier --
                    I didn't want this!
                          (spits out the words)
                    If anybody made me, it's you.

      Sarah takes a startled step BACKWARDS -- Jaime takes the
      opening, HITS hard and REVERSES their positions, so now it's
      SARAH up against the steel bars and broken glass.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                          (deadly)
                    And I won't let you kill Eric.  I
                    will not.

      SARAH'S expression is strangely SHOCKED -- and suddenly, she
      TWISTS her arms free, CLAMPING her hands on Jaime's temples.

      With Jaime's head between her hands, Sarah starts to PRESS.

      JAIME STRUGGLES to get free, but Sarah's hands hold her like
      a VISE, her head immobile -- Jaime's eyes ROLL BACK, the
      pain UNBEARABLE, and she SCREAMS.                                                                                        72.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm sorry. 

      JAIME somehow FOCUSES for an instant, eyes fixing on Sarah --
      and she PUNCHES her in the gut, Sarah's grip LOOSENS -- and
      JAIME KICKS her so hard she goes FLYING across the room.

      SARAH twists in midair, lands in a CROUCH on the floor --

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    It doesn't matter anyway. 

      SEVERAL THUGS come racing into the room, guns RAISED --

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Masters is already done. 
                          (glances at her watch)
                    He has maybe an hour.  No more.

      Jaime looks from Sarah to the advancing Thugs -- and lightning-*
      fast, she JUMPS STRAIGHT UP, into the rafters.  THE THUGS*
      fire after her, but she's already PUNCHED a hole in the roof,*
      VAULTING through to vanish into the darkness.*

      SARAH goes to the barred window, looks out -- there's nothing
      but SILENCE and DARKNESS outside.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                          (repeating, quietly)
                    I'm sorry.

      EXT. STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO -- NIGHT

      JAIME runs like a BLUR through the streets, black fatigues *
      making her almost INVISIBLE.  The city FLIES by her -- she's*
      a FLASH of black in the shadows, moving too fast to follow.*

                    It's Sommers.  Headed underground.*

      INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LOCKDOWN ROOM -- NIGHT

      JAIME has come to stop in front of the SECURITY GUARDS at
      the door.  She's SCARY LOOKING -- breathing hard from her
      RUN, covered with sweat and bruises and blood --

                                      JAIME
                    Get out of my way.                                                                                        73.

                                      GUARD 1
                    We don't have authorization to --

      And Jaime SWEEPS him aside with one arm.  He goes FLYING to*
      SMACK into a wall, sliding down, UNCONSCIOUS.  GUARD 2 pulls*
      his gun, but JAIME grabs it in a FLASH of movement and CRUSHES*
      it one-handed, KICKING Guard 2 aside.*

      She TEARS open the door, hinges RIPPING off --*

      INT. LOCKDOWN ROOM -- NIGHT

      -- and rushes in to find ERIC sitting on the bed.

                                    ERIC
                    Jaime?  What -- ?

      Jaime looks frantic, almost HYSTERICAL --

                                      JAIME
                    We have to get you out.  She's coming. 
                    She said you have an hour -- there's
                    only minutes left -- she had one of
                    the strike team, she's probably got
                    more people here --
                          (frantic)
                    There's a bomb, or an assassin, or --*

                                      ERIC*
                    There's nothing to worry about, ok? 
                    I'm fine.  We're safe.

                                      JAIME
                          (hysterically)
                    We're not safe, you said yourself,
                    she never gives up!  We have to go,
                    get out of here now -- she'll take
                    you, Eric, and I'll lose you forever --

      For some reason, Eric doesn't look frightened -- just SAD. 
      He takes her hands in his, holding them to his chest.

                                    ERIC
                    I'll never leave.  I won't.  I'll
                    always be here, always --

      And without warning, POPPP! the space where Eric was is
      suddenly EMPTY.  He's just -- disappeared.

                                      JAIME
                    Eric?  Eric!!

      WIDE ON JAIME, standing in SHOCK, alone in an EMPTY ROOM.

                                      END OF ACT SIX                                                                                        74.

                                        ACT SEVEN

      JONAS comes skidding into the room, through the wreckage of
      the door.  Jaime WHIRLS on him, TERRIFIED, completely FREAKING --

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    He's gone!  Sarah, she's, she's done
                    something --

                                      JONAS
                    Listen to me -- did she touch you? 

                                      JAIME
                    She's gotten in here, somehow -- but --
                            (hysterical, mystified)
                    He was right here!  We have to find
                    him, she's going to kill him --

      Jonas grabs her by the shoulders, trying to get through --

                                      JONAS
                    Did Sarah touch you?

      Jaime STOPS, realizing something is going on, pushing down
      her panic to FOCUS on Jonas.   She looks at him in disbelief,
      bruised and bloody, TORN BIONIC ARM leaking BLUE-WHITE blood --

                                      JAIME
                            (incredulously)
                    What do you think?

                                      JONAS
                    Did she touch your head? 
                      Specifically?

      Without waiting for an answer, he TURNS her head gently,
      looking at her temples, right above the hairline -- where
      Sarah held Jaime's head in her hands.

                                      JAIME
                      I thought--she was trying to kill me--

      C.U. JAIME'S TEMPLES -- on each side, a TINY BURN lies red
      and BLISTERED on Jaime's skin. 

                                      JONAS
                    She must have modified her hands,
                    created a variable-frequency
                      ultrasound arc.
                          (turns back to her)
                    She burned out one of your components. 

      Jaime is getting an INKLING of the truth now, something HUGE
      and TERRIBLE.                                                                                          75.

                                      JAIME
                    Which one, Bledsoe?
                          (off his silence)
                    Which one?!

                                      JONAS
                    One of the chips in your brain, meant
                    to be used for combat simulation. 
                    It tied in directly to your cerebral
                    cortex;  you can see, feel, even
                    taste the input.  It makes the sim
                    as... convincing as possible.

                                      JAIME
                          (dawning horror)
                    It makes me see things that aren't
                    there?

      Jonas takes a step closer, looks directly in her eyes. 

                                      JONAS
                    Eric is dead.  He died on the
                    operating table, two hours after he
                    was shot. 

      Jaime STAGGERS back as if Jonas had HIT her.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    I told Ruth to use the chip to input
                    a sim of Eric, so you'd believe he
                    was still alive. 

                                      JAIME
                    No... no, the things he said... it
                    was Eric, it was --

                                      JONAS
                    Once the scenario is downloaded, the
                    program becomes semi-autonomous -- 
                    it draws on your own subconscious. 
                          (quietly uncomfortable)
                    In some ways, you've been talking to
                    yourself.

      Jaime is looking around the room, REMEMBERING what Eric said
      to her, REPLAYING their conversations -- 

                                      JAIME
                    It mattered... that I could forgive
                    him. 
                          (bitter laugh)
                    Of course it did.

      And suddenly, her PAIN vanishes, replaced by COLD FURY.  She
      WHIRLS on Jonas, GRABBING him by the THROAT and SLAMMING him
      HARD against the wall.                                                                                        76.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)*
                    But I don't have to forgive you. *

                                      JONAS
                          (struggling to breathe)
                    I -- had to -- I needed you, couldn't
                    be sure --

                                      JAIME
                          (finishing the sentence)
                    -- that I'd go on your little field
                    trip if I didn't have anything left
                    to protect?  So you lied to me to
                    get what you wanted.

      She CLOSES her hand TIGHTER around his neck -- JONAS' FEET
      kick the air, he's PINNED to the wall, CHOKING --

                                      JONAS
                          (hoarse, choked)
                    Jaime -- please --

                                      JAIME
                    This is what a power differential
                    feels like from the other side.

      She holds him, unmoving as STONE, as he STRUGGLES vainly.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                          (a hard whisper)
                    Am I inspiring trust right now?

      Jonas is BEYOND SPEAKING, his eyes BULGING -- and Jaime DROPS
      him.  He CRUMPLES to the floor, GASPING for breath.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)*
                            (disgusted)*
                    You're so far into your world of*
                    lies and secrets that you've forgotten*
                    what it means to be an actual person.*
                          (an edge)*
                    Ironic, considering how much more*
                    "human" you are than me.  Technically.*

                                      JONAS
                          (gasping)
                    I'm -- I'm sorry -- I just --

      He COUGHS violently, looks up at her, and for a moment, all
      his power and arrogance are stripped away.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    He was my friend.  I don't have many
                    of those.  I wanted him avenged, I
                    wanted to stop her -- and I didn't
                    think anyone could do it but you.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        77.*

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                          (sadly)*
                    I was right.  Only you survived -- *

                                      JAIME*
                    She didn't kill them. *
                          (off his surprise)*
                    One of your hand-picked G.I. Joes*
                    has gone over to the dark side.  We*
                    walked right into a trap -- Sarah*
                    had guns, men, everything waiting. *
                    She says she's starting her own*
                      organization.*

      Jonas gets to his feet.*

                                      JONAS*
                    She must want them for intel.  Jae,*
                      especially.  She'll torture them --*
                    and then she'll kill them.*

      Jaime's face has gone HARD.  Something's been RIPPED out of
      her, and what it's left behind is cold RAGE.

                                      JAIME
                    No.  She's not going to kill anyone
                    else. 

                                      JONAS*
                    You're going to help me get them*
                    back?  You'd do that?  Why?*

                                      JAIME
                    Because it's the human thing to do. 

      INT. RUTH'S LAB -- DAY

      CLOSE ON JAIME'S BIONIC ARM, open and being repaired.

                                      RUTH*
                          (frankly)*
                    I'm sorry for doing the sim. *

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL RUTH working on Jaime's forearm with*
      tools and a WELDER.  In the B.G., Jonas PACES.*

                                    RUTH (CONT'D)*
                    It was -- stupid.  Unnecessary.*

                                      JAIME*
                    The word you want is "wrong."*

      Ruth gives a half-snort of laughter.*

                                      RUTH*
                    I guess it is.*                                                                                        78.*

      Jaime looks at Ruth searchingly -- desperate for someone to*
      CONFIDE in. *

                                      JAIME*
                    The truth is... I don't know if I*
                    can stop her.  Both times I fought*
                    her, I -- Sarah was so fast, so strong --*

                                      RUTH*
                    You were thinking.  Don't think. *
                    React.  Don't stop, don't doubt,*
                    don't second-guess.*

      Ruth seals the arm, then LOOKS Jaime in the eye. *

                                    RUTH (CONT'D)
                    The knowledge is in you, as deep as
                    your cells.  It's part of you now. 
                    You're just afraid to know it. 
                          (intense, repeating)
                    Don't think.  Just be what you are.

      Jonas crosses back to them, looking close to DESPERATE.*

                                      JONAS*
                    We don't even know where she is --*

                                      RUTH*
                    We can find her.  All the the team*
                    carry tracking locators embedded in*
                    their skin.  Sarah knows that, she'll*
                    already have torn them out -- except*
                    for Jae's.*

                                      JONAS*
                    That's because he doesn't have one.*

                                      RUTH*
                    No, he refused one.  So I put a*
                      nanotracer in his flu shot. *

      A second as this sinks in -- and Jonas GRINS.*

                                      JONAS*
                    We're going to need a mission profile --*

                                      JAIME*
                          (shortly)
                    No.  We're not.
                          (before Jonas objects)
                    If you mount a full-scale attack --
                    assuming you could, without Sarah
                    finding out -- the strike team will
                    end up dead.

                                      JONAS
                    So instead... ?                                                                                        79.

                                      JAIME
                    I'm going to walk in the front door
                    and ask for a job.

      Ruth looks intrigued, but Jonas is HORRIFIED. 

                                      JONAS
                    Now wait a minute -- 

                                      JAIME
                    She burned out the chip, instead of
                    killing me.  She knew Eric was dead,
                    somehow --
                          (to Jonas)
                    -- and she wanted me to see what a
                    liar you were.  Why?

                                    RUTH
                          (getting it)
                    So you'd come to her.

                                      JAIME
                    And that's exactly what I'm going to
                    do.

                                      JONAS
                    This is a really terrible plan.

                                      JAIME
                          (retorting)
                    Can't be worse than your last one.
                    Ever heard of Occam's Razor?
                          (off their blank looks)
                    "All things considered, the simplest*
                    solution is usually the best."*
                          (to Ruth)
                    Don't you people read?

                                    RUTH
                          (stifles a grin)
                    Does "Particle Physics Review" count?

                                      JONAS
                    I can't allow this.

                                      JAIME
                          (hardening)
                    It's not your choice.  You need me,
                    so we do it my way.

                                      JONAS
                    And your way is to just walk right
                    in, totally unarmed?

                                      JAIME
                    Well.  Not totally.                                                                                        80.

      EXT. ABANDONED TENEMENT -- NIGHT

      A vacant TENEMENT BUILDING in a dark, deserted SLUM, broken
      windows like jagged, blind eyes staring into the night.

      JAIME walks up to the door, ALONE.

      TWO ARMED THUGS melt out of the shadows, blocking her way --

                                      JAIME
                    I hear your boss is hiring. 

      The Thugs GRIN at each other, then motion her through.  She
      walks inside, VANISHING into the inky shadows beyond.

      INT. ABANDONED TENEMENT -- APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      A ruined, abandoned APARTMENT, torn sofa and tattered chairs,
      ragged moth-eaten rug, mildewed walls.  A PARODY of a
        comfortable, warm home.  Jaime comes in, the door CLOSING
      decisively behind her.

      SARAH emerges from the bedroom, looks at Jaime thoughtfully.

                                      SARAH*
                    I knew you'd find me.  But I wasn't*
                    sure you'd forgive me for Masters.*

                                      JAIME
                    I didn't say that I have.  But he
                    lied to me, and so did Bledsoe. 
                    They both wanted to own me.  Maybe...
                    I don't want to be owned.

      Sarah smiles, sardonic, but somehow -- APPROVING. 

                                      SARAH
                    You know the rules.

      Jaime NODS, swallowing hard.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Strip.  Down to your underwear.

      While Sarah WATCHES, amused, Jaime swiftly STRIPS down to a
      tank top and underwear, TOSSING her clothes on a chair.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    No weapons -- just the two of us. 
                    You last as long as you can.  And
                    then... I decide.

      And without another word, Sarah LAUNCHES herself, BLURRING
      with speed, right at Jaime.

                                      END OF ACT SEVEN                                                                                        81.

                                        ACT EIGHT

      INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      JAIME is SLAMMED back against the wall -- for a moment it
      looks like Sarah is going to PUMMEL her like last time --

      -- but then Jaime's face goes STRANGELY CALM, relaxed, no
      fear, no THOUGHT at all, nothing but INSTINCT --

                                    RUTH (V.O.)
                    Don't think.  

      -- and Jaime FIGHTS BACK.

      They SLAM into each other like GLADIATORS -- HURLING each
      other into walls and furniture with strength and speed that's*
      almost INHUMAN.*

      JAIME lands a BLOW on Sarah's jaw, SPLITTING her lip.  SARAH
      wipes her hand over her mouth --*

                                      SARAH
                          (a wicked grin)
                    Sommers.  I wasn't sure you had it
                    in you.

      She CHARGES for Jaime again -- Jaime is THROWN over the pass-
      through, into the tiny KITCHEN. *

                                      JAIME
                          (panting)
                    This -- is a ridiculous way to conduct
                    a job interview --

      Sarah RIPS the metal fridge door free and SLINGS it at Jaime --*

                                      SARAH
                    I thought about going on craigslist,
                    but this seemed so much more direct.

      JAIME THROWS her arm up, BLOCKING the fridge door -- she*
      whirls, KICKS SARAH, sending her FLYING into --

      THE LIVING ROOM -- SARAH SLAMS into the radiator so hard she*
      DENTS it.  She twists, TEARS the radiator from the wall --

      -- and SLAMS it into Jaime's CHEST, sending her SPRAWLING
      onto the floor, PINNING her with the mass of metal.*

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    It's not just a physical test.  It's
                      a psychological one.  What do you
                    do, when you know you can't win?

      Jaime STRUGGLES to move the radiator, but Sarah PUSHES it
      down harder, holding Jaime PINNED to the floor.                                                                                         82.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    When you're staring death in the
                    face, and there's no escape? 

      Sarah keeps talking, eyes locked on Jaime's -- but we see*
      JAIME'S HAND, as she SINKS her fingers INTO THE METAL RADIATOR --*

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                          (almost a whisper)
                    How do you deal with despair?

      -- and Jaime SWINGS the radiator and KICKS, her foot CRACKS
      into Sarah's temple as the radiator SLAMS Sarah back.*

      Jaime ROLLS, comes up fast, eyes BLAZING.

                                      JAIME
                    If you're waiting for me to give up,
                    we're going to be here a long time.

      They REGARD each other for a moment, bleeding and POISED to
      attack, the apartment in RUINS around them -- and then:

                                      SARAH
                    You're hired.
                          (steps back)
                      Congratulations.

      She holds out her hand -- and after a moment, Jaime TAKES
      it.  They shake.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Get dressed.

      Jaime goes to the chair -- which has been DEMOLISHED -- and
      fishes out her dust-covered clothes.   As she dresses:

                                      JAIME
                    How did you know Bledsoe would lie
                    to me?

                                      SARAH
                    He lies like other people breathe. 
                    When you said you were there to save
                    Masters -- I knew what Jonas must
                    have done.  Because no one could
                    have survived those wounds.  Except
                    maybe one of us.
                          (shrugging)
                    So I burned out the chip, to let you 
                    see the truth. 

      Jaime's finished dressing, she comes up behind Sarah --

                                      JAIME
                    Thank you.  For that.                                                                                        83.

      And lighting-fast, she SNAKES her right arm around Sarah's
      NECK, CLAMPING her bionic arm TIGHT -- CHOKING her and
      PRESSING on her carotid at the same time.

      SARAH STRUGGLES -- JAIME holds her from behind, mouth to
      Sarah's ear.*

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    I'm not a liar.  But you people are
                    teaching me fast.

      Sarah is GASPING, CHOKING -- 

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    So much of us is machine -- but we
                    still have lungs that breathe, and
                    hearts that beat.

      Jaime RIPS open a hastily sewn seam at the bottom of her
      SHIRT, pulling out a small SYRINGE --

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    We're human.  That part of us can't
                    be cut away.  

      -- and she JAMS the syringe into Sarah's NECK, INJECTS her. 

      Jaime LETS GO of Sarah -- Sarah WHIRLS on her, but then
      STAGGERS, uncertain.  She looks at Jaime, HORRIFIED.

                                      SARAH
                    What... did you... ?

                                      JAIME
                    I tranked you, that's all.  You're
                    coming back with us.

      Sarah LURCHES toward her, SWAYING, barely able to stand.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)*
                    Just tell me -- why did you kill*
                    Eric?  So you could be the only one*
                    with bionics? *

      Sarah GRABS Jaime by the arm, trying to stay upright.

                                      SARAH
                    No one... should ever have been...
                          (tries again)
                    He shouldn't have done it.  To me. 
                    To anyone.  I killed him... to...
                    stop him...

      And Sarah PASSES OUT.  Jaime CATCHES her as she falls, 
      lowering her with surprising GENTLENESS to the floor.                                                                                        84.

      Outside the window, the MOON shines full and cold, casting
      pale light over the shabby tenement.

      In the streaming moonlight, Jaime stands perfectly still --
      and LISTENS.

      SFX as we hear the BIONIC EAR engaged -- it's like listening
      to a RADIO, tuning rapidly through different FREQUENCIES as
      she listens in on different ROOMS --

                                      MAN'S VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                    -- think they can cheat me --

                                      MAN'S VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                    -- your turn to get the smokes --

                                      MAN'S VOICE 3 (O.S.)
                    -- give me that! --

                                      MAN'S VOICE 4 (O.S.)
                    -- what we want to know, and this
                    can all stop --

                                      RADCLIFFE (O.S.)
                    Screw -- you.

      JAIME freezes, tilting her head -- SFX as the VOICES and
      SOUNDS become LOUDER, CRYSTAL CLEAR, as she HOMES in on them --

                                      MAN'S VOICE 4
                    You could make this stop, Jae, anytime
                    you want --

      Jaime looks UPWARDS, following the sound -- 

      POV JAIME, VFX BIONIC EYE -- as the ear TRIANGULATES, the
      heads-up display ZEROES in on an AREA, showing a rough
      SCHEMATIC of distance and area -- outlining a ROOM on the
      top floor.

                                      JAIME
                          (to unconscious Sarah)
                    I'll pick you up on the way out.

      And Jaime heads for THE WINDOW.

      EXT. TENEMENT -- NIGHT

      Jaime climbs smoothly out the window, looking UPWARDS --

      VFX BIONIC EYE, as the TARGETING DISPLAY narrows to THE SAME
      ROOM on the top floor.

      Jaime looks upward, GAUGING the distance -- and JUMPS. 

      She SHOOTS up -- CATCHES herself ON THE LIP OF THE ROOF,*
      bionic fingers DIGGING into the cement like it was CLAY.                                                                                        85.

      She's HANGING right outside the window of the room -- the
      window is BOARDED UP.  She SWINGS backwards like a gymnast --
      and SLAMS her legs feet-first INTO THE WINDOW.

      INT. TENEMENT ROOM -- NIGHT

      JAIME comes SAILING into the room in a HAIL of shattered
      glass and splintered wood, landing in a CROUCH on the floor.
      In a SPLIT SECOND she takes in the scene --*

      ONE THUG AND BRETT are busily SHOVING RADCLIFFE headfirst
      into a filthy SINK, holding him face-down in moldy water, as

      TWO OTHER THUGS look on, guns loosely in their hands, while

      JAE AND THE OTHER GUYS are chained against the wall.  Jae is
      SHIRTLESS, cloth over his shoulder wound, soaked in BLOOD.*

      VFX BIONIC EYE as it TARGETS instantly, ranking THREAT
      ASSESMENT for each THUG, IDENTIFYING their WEAPONS -- and

      JAIME ATTACKS.

      She's a BLUR of motion, SLAMMING into the first Thug before
      he knows what hit him, KICKING out to catch the second across
      his jaw, his gun going FLYING from his hand as he COLLAPSES.*

      THUG 3 AND BRETT frantically draw their guns as Jaime LEAPS
      for them, PUNCHING Thug 3 so hard he SAILS across the room,
      DENTING the wall.  She WHIRLS to face Brett --*

      KERBLAMMM! Brett is THROWN BACKWARDS, SHOT right through the
      heart.  Jaime turns to see

      JAE, shakily holding the Thug's gun in his chained hands. 
      Jaime strides over to Jae.  

                                      JAIME
                    Time to go.  Unless you still need
                    to work on your trust issues.

      Jae looks up at her, pale from loss of blood, but still
      manages a ghost of a smile.

                                    JAE
                    I'm good.

      She reaches down, TEARS the chains on his arms like PAPER.*

      INT. STAIRWELL -- TENEMENT -- NIGHT

      THE SPEC OPS GUYS move quickly and silently down the stairs,
      armed with the Thugs' guns.  Jaime supports Jae, who can
      barely WALK.  As they pass the 2nd floor, Jaime PAUSES --                                                                                        86.

                                      JAIME
                    I have to get Sarah.  Go ahead, I'll
                    catch up --

      The GUYS look at her, all of one mind --

                                      DANNY
                    No damned way you're going alone.

      INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      Flanked by the Spec Ops Guys, Jaime OPENS the door -- and
      the ruined apartment is EMPTY.  Sarah is GONE.

      O.S. SHOUTING and FOOTSTEPS -- Jae PULLS her from the door --

                                    JAE
                    Let's go, Sommers.  Let's go.*

      EXT. TENEMENT -- NIGHT

      A black van comes SCREAMING up, door open to reveal JONAS -- *
      The Spec Ops Guys RACE outside, Jaime half-carrying Jae,*
      bullets RICOCHETING off the van as the Team PILES in -- *

                                    MAC
                    Go, go, go!

      RUTH is driving -- she FLOORS IT, Jonas DOGS the door shut,*
      and the van CAREENS away into the darkness.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. JONAS' COMPLEX -- DAWN

      The first light of dawn is STREAKING the sky over the peaceful
      acres of Jonas' complex.

      JAIME is sitting on a boulder outside the complex, watching
      the sun rise.  She's beaten up, grimy.  JONAS comes up behind*
      her, sits down beside her.

                                      JONAS
                    Thank you.

      Jaime nods, silent.  

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    I can't ask for your trust.  I know
                    I don't deserve it.  But, the thing
                    is -- you were good at what you just
                    did.

      Jaime just keeps watching the sunrise.                                                                                         87.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    I need you, even though you don't
                    need me.  From what I can see, you've
                    spent a lot of your life trying to
                    rescue people -- like your sister --
                    and not always with the best results. 
                    I think some part of you wants to do
                    more.  I want to give you the chance
                    to do that.  Just... think about it.

      Jaime turns to look at him, inscrutable -- then STANDS.

                                      JAIME
                    It's time for me to get home. 

      INT. JAIME'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

      Jaime comes into the apartment, looking THRASHED.  She's
      cleaned up and changed, but the EXHAUSTION is written bone-
      deep into her body.  She drops her bag by the door, heads*
      for the kitchen --*

                                      BECCA
                    Where the hell have you been?

      Jaime almost JUMPS out of her skin -- BECCA is sitting in
      the kitchen, drinking a cup of black coffee, looking PISSED.

                                      BECCA (CONT'D)
                    You've been gone all night -- you
                    act like you don't even live here.
                    Damn it, what is going on with you?

                                      JAIME
                    I'm fine.

      And, unbelievably, Jaime's eyes start to FILL.

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    I just need -- some coffee --

      Her hands are SHAKING visibly as she tries to get a cup --
      tears SPILL down her face, she can't stop them.*

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    I'm -- always fine -- 

      Jaime has to stop speaking, tears FLOODING.  Becca is FLOORED,
      and actually a little SCARED.*

                                      BECCA
                          (akwardly gentle)
                    Hey, come on --

      Jaime can't answer, just shakes her head mutely, tears
      FALLING.  Becca reaches out, hesitantly STROKES her back.                                                                                        88.

                                      BECCA (CONT'D)
                    -- it can't be that bad, right?

        Soundlessly, Jaime LEANS into her sister.  Becca WRAPS her
      arms around Jaime, almost keeping her from falling. 

                                      BECCA (CONT'D)
                          (worried)
                    Jesus, James, what happened?

      Jaime just HANGS ON TIGHT, doesn't answer.

      PULL BACK on the two of them, for the first time showing the
      LOVE that binds them, in the way only sisters can be bound.

                                      BECCA (CONT'D)
                    Do you want me to make you a poptart?

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. STARBUCKS -- DAY

      Jaime and Maggie are making coffees behind the bar -- when
      Jaime looks up to see JONAS, looking a little UNCOMFORTABLE.

                                      JONAS
                          (glancing around)
                    Well, this is... quaint.  I don't
                    see why we had to meet here --

                                      JAIME
                    Because I don't have a helicopter
                    and you do.  But I'm not off for
                    another half-hour --

      She glances over at Maggie -- but she just GRINS at her, and
      instead of asking Maggie to cover, says to Jonas:

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    -- so you'll have to wait.
                          (hands him a drink)
                    Have a macchiato.

      EXT. STARBUCKS -- PATIO -- AFTERNOON

      Jonas is sitting with his drink, uncomfortably reading a*
      magazine.  Jaime DROPS into the seat across from him. 

                                      JAIME
                    We need some ground rules.

                                      JONAS
                          (startled)
                    We do?                                                                                        89.

                                      JAIME
                          (right to business)
                    This never touches Becca.  She never
                    knows.  You get her a tutor, to help
                    with her grades, and some kind of
                      protection when I'm not around. 
                          (quickly)
                    Although, you know, low-key -- not
                    someone visibly ex-military.  And
                      definitely not male.

      Jonas is trying hard not to smile, not entirely succeeding.

                                      JONAS
                    Not male.  Right.

                                      JAIME
                    I'm working, so I'll want to pull a
                      reasonable salary.  But I'm keeping
                    my day job.

                                      JONAS
                          (not quite sure he
                              understands)
                    You want to keep working -- here.

                                      JAIME
                    Look, I'm not going to spend all my
                    time talking about handguns and who
                    can wire C4 the fastest. I like my
                    job, my friends, my world.  I'm not
                    trading it for yours.  Understand?

                                      JONAS
                    Actually, I do.

                                      JAIME
                    I choose the missions;  I can say no
                    to anything.

      She looks him in the eye, CHALLENGING, for the final thing:

                                      JAIME (CONT'D)
                    And you never, ever lie to me again.

                                      JONAS
                    Fair enough.  But I've got a condition
                    myself.

      Jaime looks uncertain --

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    So far, you've cost me a bloody
                    fortune in doors.

      Jonas pulls a PASSKEY from his pocket, like the one we've
      seen him use in the complex.                                                                                         90.

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                    Here.  This is a passkey that opens
                    every door in the complex.  Complete
                    access.

      Jaime takes it, nodding. 

                                      JONAS (CONT'D)
                          (quietly)
                    No lies, nothing hidden.  Ever.

      He holds out a hand -- and Jaime takes it.

                                      JAIME
                    It's a deal.

      Jonas GRIMACES slightly as they shake hands.

                                      JONAS
                    You're really hurting me right now.

                                      JAIME
                          (a little smile)
                    I know. 
                          (lets go of his hand)
                    So when do we leave for Korea?

      And off the two of them, we --

                                                                              FADE OUT.
