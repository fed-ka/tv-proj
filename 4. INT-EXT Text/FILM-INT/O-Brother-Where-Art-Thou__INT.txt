The driver shoots a glance up to the rearview mirror as the
sirens grow louder, then gropes inside his coat.
DRIVER
Any a you boys know your way around
a Walther PPK?
DELMAR
Well now, that's where we cain't
help ya. I don't believe it's in
Mississippi.
The man stops withdrawing the gun and appraises his
passengers. Delmar reacts to the paper currency fluttering
inside the car:
DELMAR
Friend, some of your folding money
has come unstowed.
DRIVER
Just stuff it down that sack there.
You boys aren't badmen, I take it?
DELMAR
Well, funny you should ask-I was
bad, till yesterday, but me'n Pete
here been saved. My name's Delmar,
and that there's Everett.
DRIVER
George Nelson. It's a pleasure.
He opens his door and steps onto the running board, giving
Everett a casual:
NELSON
Grab the tiller, will ya buddy?
Everett slides over, startled. George Nelson, now fully
outside and facing the pursuit vehicles, has one hand clamped
on the car roof and waves to Delmar with the other.
NELSON
Hand up that Thompson, Jack.
Delmar gropes in the footwell.
DELMAR
Say, what line of work are you in,
George?
Far up some sleepy holler. An old man in overalls and his
wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny
voice. They look at each other wordlessly, look back at the
crystal set.
BACK TO BANQUET HALL
Stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks
apprehensively on.
STOKES
Is you is or is you ain't -
A disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug;
Stokes continues to mouth the inaudible words.
Pappy is considering the crowd.
PAPPY
Goddamn! Oppitunity knocks!
He starts clambering up onto the stage.
Two men advance through the clapping audience holding high
either end of an eight-foot rail. When they reach Stokes,
other audience members help load him onto the rail.
Onstage, Pappy claps along with the audience.
As they play, the band members fearfully eye Pappy, who
advances on them.
Pappy joyfully shakes his fat ass in time to the music and
does a little two-step. The audience roars. The band relaxes,
performing with even more gusto.
Stokes is being through the crowd on the rail, jeered at and
pelted with comestibles until he bangs out the exit.
As the songs rolls into its big finish the audience roars
approval, and Pappy elbows in to the microphone, beaming.
PAPPY
That's fine, that's fine!...
He drops one arm around Everett, the other around Delmar.
PAPPY
...Ladies'n gentlemens here and
listenin' at home, the great state
of Mississippi (Pappy O'Daniel,
Gov'nor) thanks the Soggy Bottom
Boys for that won-a-ful performance!
Cheers.
PAPPY
Now it looks like the only man in
our great state who ain't a music
luvva, is my esteemed opponent in
the upcomin', Homer Stokes -
Boos.
PAPPY
Yeah, well, they ain't no accountin'
f'taste. It sounded t'me like he
harbored some kind a hateful grudge
against the Soggy Bottom Boys on
account a their rough'n rowdy past.
Boos.
PAPPY
Sounds like Homer Stokes is the kinda
fella gonna cast the first stone!
Boos.
PAPPY
Well I'm with you folks. I'm a f'give
and f'get Christian. And I say, well,
if their rambunctiousness and
misdemeanorin' is behind 'em - It
is, ain't it, boys?
Everett hesitates, not sure where this is going.
EVERETT
Sure is, Governor.
PAPPY
Why then I say, by the par vested in
me, these boys is hereby pardoned!
Loud cheers prod Pappy to another level of inspiration:
PAPPY
And furthermore, in the second Pappy
O'Daniel administration, why, these
boys - is gonna be my brain trust!
Raucous cheers.
The band beams, but Delmar leans into Everett, worried:
DELMAR
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
EVERETT
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are
gonna be the power behind the throne
so to speak.
DELMAR
Oh, okay.
PAPPY
So now, without further ado, and by
way of endorsin' my candidacy, the
Soggy Bottom Boys is gonna lead us
all in a chorus of 'You Are My
Sunshine' - ain't ya, boys?
He gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett holds for
a considering beat.
EVERETT
...Governor - that's one of our
favorites!
Pappy returns a considered appraisal:
PAPPY
Son, you gonna go far.
The song begins.
LATER
The steps of the meeting hall. People stream out of the
concert into the warm summer night.
Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps
with Penny.
EVERETT
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna
be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be
able to throw a little patronage his
way, get the man a job diggin' ditches
or rounding up stray dogs.
DELMAR
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
PENNY
McGill. No, the marriage'll take
place as planned.
EVERETT
Just a little change of cast. Me and
the little lady are gonna pick up
the pieces'n retie the knot,
mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're
invited, of course. Hell, you're
best men! Already got the rings.
He raises Penny's left hand with his own to display their
wedding bands - but Penny's finger is bare.
EVERETT
Where's your ring, honey?
PENNY
I ain't worn it since our divorce
came through. It must still be in
the rolltop in the old cabin. Never
thought I'd need it; Vernon bought
one encrusted with jewels.
EVERETT
Hell, now's the time to buy it off
him cheap.
PENNY
We ain't gettin' married with his
ring!
You said you'd changed!
EVERETT
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old
pewter thing -
PENNY
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
EVERETT
It's just a symbol, honey -
PENNY
No weddin'.
DELMAR
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
EVERETT
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar -
it's just -
PENNY
I have spoken my piece and counted
to three.
She walks off.
EVERETT
Oh, goddamnit! She counted to three!
Sonofabitch! You know how far that
cabin is?!
His attention, and everyone else's, is drawn by a procession
on the street below. A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a
man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being
escorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their
nightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation.
Everett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the
last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar
cries out:
DELMAR
George!
It is indeed George Nelson, grinning and game despite his
heavy restraints.
GEORGE
'Lo, boys! Well, these little men
finally caught up with the criminal
a the century! Looks like the chair
for George Nelson. Yup! Gonna
electrify me!
I'm gonna go off like
a Roman candle!
Twenty thousand
volts chasin' the rabbit through
yours truly! Gonna shoot sparks out
the top of my head and lightning
from my fingertips!
As he passes he turns to call back over his shoulder:
GEORGE
Yessir! Gonna suck all the power
right outa the state! Goddamn, boys,
I'm on top of the world! I'M GEORGE
NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!
Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go.
DELMAR
Looks like George is right back on
top again.
BLACK
In the black we hear snuffling, growing louder, closer,
slobberier.
A crack of light. We are inside a cupboard. Its door is being
nosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout.
As the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed
with light. It contains, next to a tangled bunch of hairnets,
several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade.
PINEY WOODS
Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are walking through the woods.
EVERETT
Well, at least you boys'll get to
see the old manse - the home where I
spent so many happy days in the bosom
of my family - a refugium, if you
will - with a mighty oak tree out
front and a happy little tire swing...
They emerge into a clearing. The cabin stands before them.
It is indeed a peaceful-looking haven with a mighty oak tree
in front. There is, however, no tire swing; instead, three
nooses hang from one stout limb.
DELMAR
Where's the happy little tire swing?
Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and
push them forward.
Moving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh-
dug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough
pine coffin.
The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the
porch, the drooling hound at his heels.
COOLEY
End of the road, boys. It's had its
twists and turns -
EVERETT
Waitaminute -
COOLEY
- but now it deposits you here.
The goons are shoving them toward the tree. Three
gravediggers, having just finished their work, emerge from
the three graves. They are shirtless black men with bandannas
round their necks.
EVERETT
Waitaminute -
COOLEY
You have eluded fate - and eluded me -
for the last time. Tie their hands,
boys.
EVERETT
You can't do this -
COOLEY
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a
friend.
Well, he'll have to wait
his turn -
EVERETT
Hang on there -
COOLEY
- and share one of your graves.
EVERETT
You can't do this - we just been
pardoned!
By the Governer himself!
DELMAR
It went out over the radio!
COOLEY
Is that right?
The leering goons, who have been lashing the men's wrists
behind their backs, pause, their sadism stymied. They look
to Cooley for guidance.
So too does the drooling hound.
Silence.
Finally:
COOLEY
...Too bad we don't have a radio.
The goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy
task.
The gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their
shovels. They begin to sing a slow and dirgelike 'You've Got
to Walk That Lonesome Valley'. Sweat glistens on them and
trickles down their faces like tears.
PETE
God have Mercy!
TOMMY
It ain't fittin'!
EVERETT
It ain't the law!
COOLEY
The law. Well the law is a human
institution.
Cooley gives the faintest smile.
COOLEY
Perhaps you should take a moment for
your prayers.
PETE
Oh my God! Everett!
DELMAR
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
PETE
Good Lord, what do we do?
Pete is in tears. Tommy is terrified. Delmar bows his head
to silently pray.
Everett bows his head as well. He murmurs:
EVERETT
Oh Lord, please look down and
recognize us poor sinners... please
Lord...
The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell.
EVERETT
...I just want to see my daughters
again.
Oh Lord, I've been separated
from my family for so long...
The mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more
palpable than audible - the song, it seems, rising out of
the earth itself.
EVERETT
...I know I've been guilty of pride
and sharp dealing. I'm sorry that I
turned my back on you, Lord. Please
forgive me, and help us, Lord, and I
swear I'll mend my ways... For the
sake of my family... For Tommy's
sake, and Delmar's, and Pete's...
The rumble is building.
EVERETT
...Let me see my daughters again.
Please, Lord, help us... Please help
us...
The rumble erupts into a deafening roar.
A wall of water is crashing through the hollow.
It engulfs everything and everybody. The cabin itself is
ripped away; the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their
feet and all is noise and confusion.
UNDERWATER
A silent world. Everett tumbles in the current in natural
slow motion.
Suspended around him are scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade.
Other objects spin slowly by; framed sepia-tinted family
portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a
frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, the wild-eyed frantically
paddling bloodhound, a tire with a rope tied around it.
FURTHER DOWNHILL
The churning torrent opens into a lowland to become a newly
created river, fast-moving but no longer violent.
After a beat of hold on the rippling waters, the surface is
broken by the up-bob of a pine coffin.
The coffin floats downstream for a beat and then Everett
pops out of the water next to it, gasping for air, shaking
his head clear of water, and moving his shoulders to finish
freeing himself from the rope round his wrists.
Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, gasping for air.
The men hang onto the coffin, which bears them downstream.
Dazed, they look around.
The inundated valley shows only the occasional roof- or
treetop poking out of the newly formed river. All is quiet
except for the gurgle of water.
DELMAR
A miracle! It was a miracle!
EVERETT
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I
told you they was gonna flood this
valley.
DELMAR
That ain't it!
PETE
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
EVERETT
It just never fails; once again you
two hayseeds are showin' how much
you want for innalect. There's a
perfectly scientific explanation for
what just happened -
PETE
That ain't the tune you were singin'
back there at the gallows!
EVERETT
Well any human being will cast about
in a moment of stress. No, the fact
is, they're flooding this valley so
they can hydro-electric up the whole
durned state...
Everett waxes smug:
EVERETT
Yessir, the South is gonna change.
Everything's gonna be put on
electricity and run on a payin' basis.
Out with the old spiritual mumbo-
jumbo, the superstitions and the
backward ways. We're gonna see a
brave new world where they run
everyone a wire and hook us all up
to a grid. Yessir, a veritable age
of reason - like the one they had in
France - and not a moment too soon...
His voice trails off as he notices something.
A cottonhouse in the middle of the river is submerged to its
eaves. A cow has taken refuge on its roof. It stands staring
at Everett, who returns the stare.
He shakes off the vision and clears his throat.
EVERETT
Not a moment too soon. Say, there's
Tommy!
Tommy has indeed just surfaced downstream, clinging to a
half-submerged piece of furniture.
EVERETT
What you ridin' there, Tommy?
The furniture beneath him begins to rotate in the current
and, to keep his head above water, Tommy climbs in place
like a hamster on a wheel. As the chest exposes its ribbed
upper half:
TOMMY
Rolltop desk...
STREET
Everett and Penny walk arm in arm, the seven Wharvey gals
behind. The girls sing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk.
EVERETT
All's well that ends well, as the
poet says.
PENNY
That's right, honey.
EVERETT
But I don't mind telling you, I'm
awful pleased my adventuring days is
at an end...
He fumbles in his pocket.
EVERETT
...Time for this old boy to enjoy
some repose.
PENNY
That's good, honey.
EVERETT
And you were right about that ring.
Any other weddin' band would not do.
But this-here was foreordained, honey;
fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya
have to have confidence -
He is slipping it onto her hand.
PENNY
That's not my ring.
EVERETT
- in the gods - Huh?
PENNY
That's not my ring.
EVERETT
Not your...
PENNY
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
EVERETT
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
PENNY
I said I thought it was in the rolltop
desk.
EVERETT
You said -
PENNY
Or, it might a been under the
mattress.
EVERETT
You -
PENNY
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Everett shakes his head.
EVERETT
Well, I'm sorry honey -
PENNY
Well, we need that ring.
EVERETT
Well now honey, that ring is at the
bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
PENNY
Uh-huh.
EVERETT
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
PENNY
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
EVERETT
Yes, but honey -
PENNY
That wasn't my doing...
Indignation quickens her pace. Everett keeps up, and the two
are pulling forward out of frame.
EVERETT
Course not, honey, but...
We are now on the Wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch,
still singing. From somewhere distant, through the song, we
can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal.
The second-to-last girl is the oldest; she holds a piece of
string along which we travel, still listening to Penny and
Everett, off:
PENNY
I counted to three, honey.
EVERETT
Well sure, honey, but...
We reach the end of the piece of string; it is wrapped around
the waist of the toddler, who lingers in frame. She gazes
down a quiet street at the edge of town that ends in an open
field.
EVERETT
...finding one little ring in the
middle of all that water...
His voice, and that of the singing girls, recedes.
EVERETT
...that is one hell of a heroic
task...
The string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of
frame.
A train track is thus revealed in the distance. The rhythmic
clack is from the hand-pumped flatcar.
The blind seer pumps the car along the distant track, singing
harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.
