      MacLeod moves carefully through the space, gun drawn, knowing
      Koren is in there somewhere.  There are stacks of BARRELS,
      piles of HAY, hanging SADDLES, farm EQUIPMENT -- Koren could
      be anywhere.  Directly ahead of MacLeod --

      A stack of WOODEN BARRELS.  Large enough to hide a man. 
      MacLeod palms back the trigger on his gun.

                                      MACLEOD
                    End of the line, Koren.  Come out
                    and face me.

      No answer.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Have it your way.

      MacLeod FIRES directly into the barrels.  The barrels rock
      with the impact of the slugs.  A BEAT -- and they slowly
      TOPPLE as a body behind them falls, crashing through them,
      lands heavily at MacLeod's feet --

      It's a dead COMANCHERO.

      Shit.  As MacLeod registers this, the HAY PILE next to the
      barrel erupts --

      KOREN

      bursts up with a savage yell and dives at MacLeod.

      MacLeod grapples with Koren, dropping his gun as he does. 
      Koren knocks him back, pulls his sword.  MacLeod grabs a
        BLACKSMITH'S HAMMER from the water barrel, blocks the next
      blow with it, and manages to get his sword out.

      They move around the stable, swinging.  Koren is a tough and
      brutal fighter, easily a match for MacLeod.

      MacLeod presses the fight until they reach the loft, where
      Koren is silhouetted in the OPEN LOFT DOOR.

      Koren blocks MacLeod's thrust with his sword, then grabs a
      kerosene lantern hanging on the wall.  He brings it down
      hard on MacLeod's head.

      MACLEOD

      goes to his knees, stunned.

      KOREN

      lowers his sword, and lifts a SCYTHE off the wall.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS
                    I do love the old ways.

      Koren brings back the scythe for the kill --

      BANG BANG BANG! -- three slugs tear into him.  Koren slams
      against the wall, drops the scythe -- and tumbles out the
      door, falling to the ground below.

      MacLeod rips free from the tines of the pitchfork, pushes to
      the open door and looks out:

      MACLEOD'S POV - KOREN

      lying below him in the dirt, dead.  Tippet and another TEXAS
      RANGER stand over him, holding their rifles.

      Tippet looks up at MacLeod.

                                      TIPPET
                    It's over.

      MacLeod slumps against the wall.  He knows it isn't.


      A dark, unpleasant place.  MacLeod threads through a maze of
      empty rooms and columns, searching for Koren.  He picks up a
      BUZZ.

      He moves toward the source, tension rising.

      NEW ANGLE

      as he reaches a corner.  His quarry is on the other side. 
      MacLeod takes a breath, readies himself -- and lunges.

      NEW ANGLE

      as his blade clashes against the sword of --

      CASSANDRA.

      MacLeod lets out an explosion of released tension and relief,
      freaked by the near miss.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra!

                    What are you doing here?

      She's as stunned as he is, but pumped with anger.

                    What does it look like?  Trying to
                    kill someone!

      She starts to push past him.  MacLeod grabs her arm and swings
      her back.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra.  He's gone.

      His voice cuts through her rage, and they stay like that,
      Cassandra wild-eyed, breathing hard, shaking with anger.

      They move off together.  The camera PANS UP out of BUZZ range
      and there, in the distance, Kronos watches and smiles.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


                                      CASSANDRA
                    I don't want a drink.

      Cassandra paces the loft, tight, waving off MacLeod's offer. 
      This isn't the contained, controlled Cassandra we've seen
      before; she's agitated and emotional.  MacLeod shrugs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then you don't mind if I have one.

      He puts the glass and bottle on the table and pours a short
      drink.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    It's not often I nearly take a

                    Or she takes mine.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    That was an accident.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (dry)
                    Glad to hear it.

                    I was this close, Duncan.  This close,
                    and he got away!
                          (grim)
                    But not again.  Never again.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You want to tell me about it?

      Cassandra paces, seems not to hear the question.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (beat)
                    I'm wasting time.

      She starts to the door.  MacLeod takes her arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then waste it.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I can't!  Don't you understand?

                    I'll take the chance.

                                      MACLEOD

                      Cassandra, I know Koren.  I know how
                    dangerous he is.

      Cassandra stares at him.  Lets out a dismissive sound.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    "Koren?"

                    Melvin Koren.  That's who we're

                    You don't know him at all.

      She looks away.  Painful memories flooding in.  She struggles
      to keep them under control.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Long before he called himself Koren,
                    he had another name.

      She straightens up and looks at him.

                    One of the Four Horsemen.

      It's a bombshell.  MacLeod stares at her.

                    If they lived at all, they've been
                    dead for ages... maybe thousands of
                    years.  The Horsemen are gone.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'd give my life to believe that.
                    But it's not true.

      She finds an HOURGLASS on the table and turns it over, and
      as the sand spills into the bottom half --

                    I never knew.

                    Whatever he calls himself, he's
                    Kronos.  He'll always be Kronos.
                          (beat)
                    All the hate.  All the pain I tried
                    to leave behind...
                          (welling up)
                    It never leaves, does it?

      MacLeod gently touches her face, wipes her tears.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Sometimes.  For a little while.

      She pulls him to her, and they kiss.  He lifts her in his
      arms, lowers her gently onto the bed.  He kisses her eyes.


      Dawson looks up from the bar to look at MacLeod and Cassandra. 
      Did he hear right?

                    Death.

      Dawson looks at her.  She's not smiling.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're serious.

                                      DAWSON
                    Look, history is full of mounted
                    raiders.  Stories become legends,
                    legends turn into myths...

      her eyes.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    A symbol didn't put my tribe to the
                    sword.

                    The Horsemen were Immortals, Joe. 
                    One is called Kronos.

      Dawson shakes his head.

                    Kronos.  Sounds like something out

      She holds his eyes.  Dawson looks at her then back at MacLeod
      for confirmation.  MacLeod nods.

      Dawson wipes a glass a little shakily, leans on the bar.

                                      DAWSON
                    What do you want me to do.

                    How?  I mean, supposing he is real,
                    I never heard of the guy until now.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But you've heard of Melvin Koren.

      And OFF Dawson's look --


      An abandoned electrical station, a tunnel with unusual,
      dramatic atmosphere.

      Methos lies on a slab, life just returning to him.  He coughs
      and opens his eyes, disoriented for a moment.  Then he sees,
      standing over him --

      Kronos, watching him, his sword held loosely.

                    It's been a long time.  How you
                    feeling?

      Methos wheezes, takes a breath, clutching his chest.

                                      METHOS
                    Like I left my heart in San Francisco.

                                      KRONOS
                    I always thought you had no heart.

                    Since you asked?

      Kronos plants his BOOT on Methos' chest and pushes hard.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    I think you could use a little pain,
                    brother.  I think it's just what you
                    need.

      He pushes hard to make his point, then lifts his foot.  Methos
      sits up, gasping.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    There was a time you'd bounce right
                    up, asking for more.  You're getting
                    soft.

      Methos pushes gingerly to his feet.

                                      METHOS
                    Not soft, Kronos.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    I just passed through my angry
                      adolescence a little earlier than
                    you.

                                      KRONOS
                    All this time, I thought you were
                    dead.  Never even bothered looking
                    for you.
                          (beat)
                    Then I heard rumors.  A word here, a
                    story there... "Methos, the world's
                    oldest man."
                          (beat)
                    You slipped up, old friend.  You got
                    sloppy.

                                      METHOS
                    No one's perfect.

                                      KRONOS
                    But you were close.
                          (beat)
                      I shouldn't be surprised you're still
                    alive.

      He steps up close to Methos and places a hand on his cheek,
      almost tenderly.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    You were always the one I counted
                    on.  You weren't the strongest, or
                    the toughest -- but you were the
                    survivor.  It's what you do best.
                          (cold)
                    Or did.

      An ominous ring to this.  Methos looks resigned.

                                      METHOS
                    So.  You came to kill me.

                                      KRONOS
                    It's what I do best.
                          (beat)
                    But you do have a choice.

      Methos hadn't expected this.

                                      METHOS
                    I'm all for choices.

      Kronos whips his sword up in a flash, puts it to Methos'
      neck.

                          (beat)
                    Or you can join me.

      Methos feels the steel pressing into his skin.  He doesn't
      dwell on the choice for long.

                                      METHOS
                    Since you put it that way...
                          (beat)
                    Welcome back.  Brother.


      MacLeod is just heading into his office when he gets the
      BUZZ.  He turns back to the dojo, tensing -- he's had enough
      surprises in one day.

      Methos steps in.  MacLeod relaxes.

                                      METHOS
                    I was worried about you yesterday. 
                    Glad you made it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Me too.

                                      METHOS
                    MacLeod, something... unexpected
                    came up.

      Before Methos can continue.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Tell me about it.  You ever hear of
                    an Immortal named Kronos?

                                      METHOS
                    Kronos... ?

      They are interrupted by the BUZZ as the elevator descends,
      the door opens --

      Cassandra steps out.  She sees Methos -- and freezes in shock.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You.

      Methos freezes for a BEAT -- then looks back to MacLeod,
      face blank -- he has no idea who she's talking about.

      MacLeod looks from her to Methos -- Methos shrugs.

                                      METHOS
                    Who's this?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Draw your sword!

      There's no time for Methos to react, for MacLeod to say
      anything -- Cassandra starts to come at him.

                                      METHOS
                    Who is she?  MacLeod!

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra!  What are you doing?

      He blocks her.  She tries to move around him, get at Methos.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Killing him.

      Methos backs away, trying to stay away from her blade.

                                      METHOS
                    I don't know what she's talking about!

      Cassandra is breathing hard, the hate in her eyes palpable.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You think I could forget you?

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Methos is backing away from Cassandra.

                                      METHOS
                    This is crazy, MacLeod, it wasn't
                    me!  Do something!

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He is.
                          (beat)
                    He's going to watch you die.

      She swings.  Methos ducks the blow.  Cassandra winds up again,
      but MacLeod grabs her arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Methos)
                    Get out!

      Methos ducks out the door as Cassandra writhes in MacLeod's
      grip.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Let me go!

                    down.

      Cassandra stops struggling.  She's breathing hard.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Okay?

                    Okay.

      He releases her -- she immediately runs to the door and looks
      out -- but Methos is gone.  She turns back to the dojo to
      look at MacLeod.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    He's gone.
                          (tight)
                    You had no right to interfere.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He doesn't even know you.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    He's a liar.
                          (as a threat)
                    Don't come between us again.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra, he's my friend.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    That "friend" of yours rode with
                    Kronos!  Killed and raped alongside
                    him!
                          (beat)
                    He was one of the Horsemen, MacLeod.

      She turns and storms out.  And OFF MacLeod's look --


      MacLeod leans on a post, while Dawson checks out the music
      equipment for the band.

                                      DAWSON
                    I dunno, MacLeod.  Kronos... Methos...

                    Ask yourself.  Does it sound like

      MacLeod shakes his head.

                    Sometimes all you got to go on is
                    your gut.  If I were you, I'd listen

                    What did you think I'd do?  Run? 
                    Hide?  Go somewhere you'd never find
                    me?

      He places a brotherly arm on Methos' shoulder.

                    Nice to feel wanted.

                                      KRONOS
                    I need you.  A dozen times I tried

                    You are one of a kind, Methos.  As
                    we all were.
                          (intense)
                    There was never a band like us. 
                    Never in all history.

      Methos nods weakly.  Kronos turns his back, starts rummaging
      through a pack.  Methos stares at him.  Thinking.  Kronos is
      vulnerable.

                                      METHOS
                    Why let me out of your sight in the
                    first place?

      It's now or never.  Slowly he draws his sword, moving toward
      Kronos.

                                      KRONOS
                    A lot of time's passed since we rode
                    together.  I had to be sure of you.

      Methos takes a silent breath, raises his sword --

      KRONOS

      suddenly spins around, has a knife to Methos' throat.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                          (a smile)
                    Now I'm sure.

      Methos throws his sword down.

                                      METHOS
                    Don't you understand?  I can't do
                    this anymore!  I've changed!

                                      KRONOS
                    No.  You pretended to, maybe you
                    even convinced yourself you had --
                    but inside, you're still there,
                    Methos.
                          (beat)
                    You're like me.

                                      METHOS
                    Not anymore!

                                      KRONOS
                    No?  Tell me you haven't missed it.

                                      METHOS
                          (bitter)
                    The killing?

                                      KRONOS
                    The freedom... The power.

      He lowers the knife and puts his arm around Methos' shoulder,
      his voice fervent, mesmerizing.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Riding out of the sun, knowing you're
                    the most terrifying thing they ever
                    laid eyes on... that their weapons
                    and their gods are useless against
                    you...
                          (beat)
                    That you're the last thing they'll
                    ever see.
                          (intense)
                    That's what you were meant to be,
                    Methos.

      Methos is silent, but we see it in his eyes: the surfacing
      of a thing long submerged.  He tries to fight it.

                                      METHOS
                    No.

      But it comes out weakly.

                                      KRONOS
                    Don't fight it, Methos.  Feel it. 
                    Embrace it.  Love it.
                          (beat)
                    It's what you are.

      Methos is silent a LONG BEAT, then...

      Kronos pats him on the back.

                                      KRONOS
                    I'm going to do you a favor.
                          (beat)
                    You know Cassandra's here.

                                      METHOS
                          (beat)
                    We didn't exactly exchange gifts.

                                      KRONOS
                    Then you know she'll kill you if she
                    gets the chance.
                          (beat)
                    You never could bring yourself to
                    take her head.
                          (beat)
                    So I'll do it for you.

      Methos is silent.  He knows Kronos is right.

                                      METHOS
                    And in return?

                                      KRONOS
                    You kill Duncan MacLeod.

      Methos blanches.

                                      METHOS
                    He's nothing to you... Why MacLeod?

                                      KRONOS
                    Because he's your friend.
                          (moving closer)
                    Because you still need to prove
                    yourself.
                          (intense)
                    And because you owe me.

      He takes out a knife and moves toward his palm.  We are on
      his face as he draws the blade over his hand.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Swear it.

      He holds Methos' eyes, extends the knife to him.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Swear you will kill MacLeod!

      Methos takes the knife, looks at it a LONG BEAT.  Then he
      cuts his own palm, and clasps it to Kronos.  Their hands
      tighten together.  Their eyes lock.

                                      METHOS
                    I swear.

      And OFF this --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod leans on the counter, brooding, as Dawson paces behind
      him.

                                      DAWSON
                    I'm not defending it, I'm trying to
                      understand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What's to understand, Joe?  When he
                    rode into a village, there were women,
                    there were children.  There was life. 
                    And when he rode out...
                          (intense)
                    There wasn't.

                                      DAWSON
                    You weren't there.
                          (beat)
                    Those were different times, Mac. 
                    Different rules, morals... you can't
                    compare it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I won't compare it and I can't excuse
                    it.

                                      DAWSON
                          (beat)
                    How many have you killed?  How much
                    blood have you spilled in anger?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know what I've done and I live
                    with it, but I'm telling you it's
                    not the same.

                                      DAWSON
                    What the hell are you talking about?

                    I'm talking about children.  I'm
                    talking about a bunch of murdering
                    bastards who burned and raped their
                    way across two continents.
                          (beat)
                    Think about what he did.
                          (beat)
                    See it.

                                      DAWSON
                    I have.
                          (beat)
                    In Nam.  When we took out a village,
                    you think we could tell the farmers
                    from the soldiers?  You think the
                    bullets somehow missed all the
                    children?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's different.

                                      DAWSON
                    How?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (errupts)
                    Because he loved it.
                          (tight)
                    Because he killed for the pleasure
                    of killing.

      He holds Dawson's eyes.  The moment is broken as a PHONE
      RINGS: Dawson's cell.  He pulls it from his pocket, listens
      briefly.

                                      DAWSON
                    Got it.

      He toggles off.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Where?

                                      DAWSON
                    An abandoned power station, near the
                    docks.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (pissed)
                    You told me you didn't have a Watcher

                                      DAWSON
                    We didn't.  But we had one on
                      Cassandra.
                          (beat)
                    She led us to Kronos.

      MacLeod reacts.  He turns without a word and heads for the
      door.


      Kronos is there when he gets the BUZZ.  He smiles, expecting
      Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    I hope you brought me his sword.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I brought mine.

      He turns to see Cassandra facing him.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    It's all I need.

      Kronos examines her with his eyes.

                                      KRONOS
                    You look different somehow.  Maybe
                    because you're on your feet for
                    once...
                          (beat)
                    Instead of your back.

      Cassandra tightens, but remains controlled.  She takes a
      step toward him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Centuries pass.  Nations come and
                    go.
                          (beat)
                    But you're the same.

                                      KRONOS
                    I try.
                          (beat)
                    Did you come for me?  I'm afraid
                    Methos is busy.  He's out killing
                    MacLeod.

      Cassandra wavers.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Come, let's see what you learned in
                    three thousand years.

                    You're weak, Kronos... tired.  All
                    you want to do is close your eyes. 
                    (beat)
                    You have to close your eyes.

      Kronos smiles, just laughs it off.

                                      KRONOS
                    Why, so you can kiss me?

                    Your sword grows heavy.

                    Make love to me before I kill you.
                          (beat)
                    And cut out the feeble tricks.  They
                    won't work on me.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Then maybe this will.

      She charges, swinging.  Kronos deflects her blow.  She's
      fast and determined, but she's angry.  As Kronos lets her
      flail away, she overreaches --

      Kronos gives his sword a twist, and disarms her.

      Cassandra backs away, using a short table to keep between
      them.  She shoves the table at him hard, trying to stay away. 
      Kronos catches it with his foot.

                    Methos never liked the idea of killing

                    But I do.

      She backs up until she's beside a stack of CONTAINER
      CYLINDERS.  As Kronos steps forward, she grabs a cylinder,
      shoves -- and they come cascading down.

      KRONOS

      is slammed aside.  Cassandra turns and runs.  Kronos throws
      off the cylinders and moves after her.

      As Cassandra races through the building.  Kronos is somewhere
      far behind her.  Then she feels a BUZZ.

      She turns -- and comes face to face with

      METHOS

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Damn you.

      She dives at him, ready to take him with her bare hands. 
      Methos takes a hit on the shoulder, then side-steps -- cold-
      cocks her with his sword-pommel.  Cassandra goes down, out
      cold.

      Methos looks at her unconscious form for a BEAT, the sword
      in his hand.  One easy swing is all it would take, and she's
      out of his life, forever.

      He hesitates a BEAT -- he looks up as he gets the BUZZ.


      Kronos is moving through the building, looking for Cassandra. 
      He feels a BUZZ ahead of him, and sees a figure standing in
      the shadows.

                                      KRONOS
                    You're dead, witch.
                          (beat)
                    Come out now and I'll make it quick. 
                    Make it hard -- I'll make you beg
                    me.

      The figure steps from the shadows -- it's MacLeod, and his
      smile is truly frightening.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then let's make it quick.
                          (beat)
                    Because I can't wait.

                                      KRONOS
                    I guess it's true.  You wait long
                    enough, everything comes back.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Everything but your head.

      He spins the katana around, brings it up one handed, motions
      Kronos towards him with the other hand.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Come and get it.

      Kronos suddenly charges in swinging.  MacLeod parries, and
      they begin to fight.96511    "Comes A Horseman"    48.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96




      MacLeod and Kronos battle around the room.  Their clothes
      are ripped, there are slashes on shoulders, legs -- it's a
      hard, furious fight, but no one shows any sign of slowing
      down.  As they pull apart, there is a CRASH from above, and
      a strange sound --

      THEIR POV - THE ROOF

      as a FLAMING BOTTLE sails through a window, down towards
      them.  They leap apart just as it strikes the floor between
      them and EXPLODES in a blazing fireball.  Flames leap up
      between them, and they fall back.


      MacLeod and Kronos continue to fight, sweating in the intense
      heat, as the ALARM screams, and the rising flames cast a hot
      orange light on them.

      There's a CRASH -- a FLAMING BEAM falls between them, forcing
      them apart as a wall of FIRE separates them.

      As the sound of approaching FIRE SIRENS sounds from outside,
      they look at each other across the flames.

                                      KRONOS
                    I can wait.

      He raises his sword in a mock salute, then turns and
      disappears behind the flames.

      MacLeod tries to follow, but the heat is too intense.  He
      shields his face as the flames rise, and finally breaks off.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      MacLeod enters, looking exhausted.  His clothes are scorched,
      shirt tattered -- he's just back from the fight.  As he
      enters, about to drop his sword -- he gets the BUZZ.  He
      raises the sword instantly --

      Cassandra steps from the shadows.

      MacLeod drops the katana, takes her in his arms.  Cassandra
      just holds him, wanting to feel the solid comfort of a body. 
      Finally she breaks off, looks at him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You found Kronos?
                          (MacLeod nods)
                    He's dead?

      MacLeod shakes his head.  Cassandra's face turns ashen.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Then I failed.

      MacLeod lifts her head.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.  You're alive... and they're
                    gone.

                    They'll never be gone until they're
                    dead.

      MacLeod sees her lost look and pulls her to him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then we'll find them. 

      Over her shoulder, his eyes are open, far away.


      MACLEOD and DAWSON are leaning against the bar as CASSANDRA
      sits at a nearby table in front of Dawson's LAPTOP.  She's
      paging through the files of Immortal after Immortal from the
      Watcher Database.  Their images flip by.

                                      DAWSON
                    You really think the other Horsemen

                    Methos and Kronos are.  Under
                    different names, different lives.

      Cassandra pushes the laptop away from her impatiently.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    This is pointless.  We're wasting
                    time.  Let's just go find Kronos.

                    It's worth a shot.

      Dawson hits a few keys on the laptop and a few names and
      pictures appear.

      As EVAN CASPARRI appears on the screen, a paleness washes
      over Cassandra's face.

      MacLeod turns from the laptop screen to see that Cassandra
      is already half way out the door.
