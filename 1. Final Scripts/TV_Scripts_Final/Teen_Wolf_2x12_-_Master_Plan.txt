                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT11

      Lit only by the blueish glow from the crescent moon in the 
      night sky, Scott McCall blinks, trying to see in the 
      darkness. All he can hear is his own nervous gasping until--

      SILHOUETTED BODIES flit by, bringing SOUND hurtling back. 
      People hurry off the bleachers, players rushing from the 
      field. Scott blinks and all is SILENT again. He searches with 
      his hearing, focusing on familiar voices.

                                    MELISSA (V.O.)
                    Scott! Scott, where are you?

                                  STILINSKI (V.O.)
                    Everyone listen--listen to me!

                                  COACH (V.O.)
                    Back off, just get back--

      A PLAYER accidentally runs into a FAN charging off the 
      bleachers. The crash of bodies and shouts of panicked parents 
      BLASTS back at Scott in full volume.

      He spins toward the field. When he blinks again, his eyes are 
      GLOWING, the blue light from the moon replaced by the yellow 
      of his werewolf eyes.

      Now seeing with heightened vision, he glances from one person 
      to the next, finding neither Jackson or Gerard. 

      Eyes simmering back to normal, Scott spots a crowd gathering 
      on the field and races ahead, almost knocking into his 
      mother.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you okay?

                                    MELISSA
                    I m fine--I m fine. But someone s 
                    hurt. Someone on the field.

      With an ELECTRIC CRACKLE, the STADIUM LIGHTS burst back on, 
      blazing to life one-by-one.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/122.

        CONTINUED:11

      Field once again illuminated, both the Beacon Hills team and 
      their opponents are revealed gathered around a fallen player.

                                  VOICE
                    He s not moving--

                                  2ND VOICE
                    --someone call an ambulance.

                                  COACH
                    All right, get back, get back!

      With Coach pulling his frightened players aside, Scott and 
      Melissa reach the body to discover--

      It s Jackson.

      Scott stops in his tracks, shocked at the sight. Lydia 
      hurtles past him, pushing aside lacrosse players twice her 
      size.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson? What s happening--What 
                    happened?

                                  COACH
                    Can we get a medic over here!

      Melissa kneels by Jackson s side and takes his wrist to feel 
      for a pulse. Then puts her ear to his chest. A quiet comes 
      over the waiting crowd.

                                    MELISSA
                    He s not breathing. No pulse.

                                  LYDIA
                    Oh God--there s blood--there s 
                    blood on him.

      While Melissa locates punctures and tears on Jackson s 
      jersey, Isaac appears at Scott s side.

                                  SCOTT
                    Look.

      Isaac follows Scott s eyes to see BLOOD on the tips of 
      Jackson s fingers, perfectly matching the puncture wounds.

                                  ISAAC
                    He did it to himself?

      SIRENS rising in the distance, Melissa begins CPR chest 
      compressions.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/123.

        CONTINUED:11

      Helpless, Coach can only watch while a tear-stained Lydia 
      kneels next to her former boyfriend.

                                    MELISSA
                    Hold his head tilted up, okay?

      Lydia nods and gently puts her hands under Jackson s head. 
      His mouth lies open, still not breathing as Melissa tries to 
      get his heart started.

      A few feet away, Sheriff Stilinski turns from the scene, 
      glancing through the crowd.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Where s Stiles? Where s my son?

      With rising fear, he looks to Scott, Isaac and the other 
      players, none of whom can seem to answer.

                                  STILINSKI (CONT D)
                    Where s Stiles? Where the hell s my 
                    son?

      INT. ARGENT HOME/BASEMENT - NIGHT22

      The basement door opens and a dark-clothed HUNTER guides 
      Stiles down the stairs by twisting his arm behind his back.

                                  STILES
                    Ow, ow, ow--

      With a shove, the hunter sends Stiles tumbling down the last 
      steps. Despite his lacrosse pads, he CRASHES painfully to the 
      concrete floor.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Ow.

      The door above slams shut, plunging the room into darkness. 
      Stiles reaches up, trying to feel along the wall when he 
      hears--

      BREATHING.

      He holds still, listening close. The breaths come urgent. 
      Tight, frightened gasps. And it s more than one person.

      Hand on the wall, Stiles pushes himself to his feet. He finds 
      a dark cord and grasps hold of it. He follows it with his 
      fingers up to a switch and--

      A LAMP CLICKS ON.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/124.

        CONTINUED:22

      Boyd and Erica sit propped against the wall, bound and 
      gagged. They stare back at Stiles, bloodied and weak, eyes 
      filled with fear, pain and worst of all... hopelessness.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT33

      Under the FLASH OF RED AND BLUE lights, Melissa watches two 
      EMT s lift the BODY BAG containing Jackson into the back of 
      an ambulance.

      A CLEAR, VISCOUS LIQUID drips from the edge of the bag, just 
      catching Melissa s eye. Before she can do anything, however, 
      the AMBULANCE DRIVER slams the doors shut.

                                  AMBULANCE DRIVER
                    Thanks for your help, but we can 
                    take it from here.

                                    MELISSA
                    You know, I m going to have to give 
                      a statement. Why don t I just ride 
                    with you?

                                  AMBULANCE DRIVER
                    Uh, I think that would be--

                                    MELISSA
                    Perfect, great.

      Melissa jumps into the passenger side of the ambulance. The 
      confused Driver shrugs and gets in.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT44

      DEPUTIES finish questioning players while Stilinski talks 
      with Isaac and Scott, both of whom are now changed out of 
      their uniforms. Flipping the pages of his note pad, 
      Stilinski s hands are noticeably shaky.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I have to meet the medical examiner 
                    and figure out what happened with 
                    Jackson, but I ve got an A-P-B out 
                    for Stiles. His Jeep s still in the 
                    parking lot, which means... well, I 
                    don t know what it means. If he 
                    answers his phone or email or if 
                    either of you see him--          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/125.

        CONTINUED:44

                                  ISAAC
                    We ll call you.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Guys, after everything that s 
                    happened lately...

                                  SCOTT
                    He probably just got freaked out by 
                    the attention or something. We ll 
                    find him.

      Stilinski nods, but doesn t look encouraged. He motions for 
      his men to follow and the locker room begins clearing out.

      An unusually distraught Coach approaches Scott. He can t seem 
      to stop turning his whistle over and over with his fingers.

                                  COACH
                    McCall, we need you on the team, 
                    okay? You know I can t put you back 
                    on the field next season unless 
                    your grades are up. 

                                  SCOTT
                    I know, Coach.

                                  COACH
                    I mean I yell and scream a lot but 
                    it s not like I hate you guys. 
                    Well, I kind of hate Greenberg, but 
                    that s different. I m just saying 
                    we need you. Get your grades up, 
                    okay? Get back on the team.

                                  SCOTT
                    I will.

      Still gripping the whistle, Coach heads for the door. Isaac 
      and Scott anxiously wait for his FOOTSTEPS to fade.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Is that everyone?

                                  ISAAC
                    I think so--

      The sound of METAL RIPPING off hinges turns Isaac around. A 
      locker door CLATTERS to the floor as Scott rifles through the 
      inside, pulling out one of Stiles s SHIRTS.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    You re going to find him by scent?          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/126.

        CONTINUED:44

                                  SCOTT
                    We both are. Here, smell this...

      Scott holds out one of Stiles s SHOES.

                                  ISAAC
                    Why do you get his shirt and I get 
                    a shoe?

      But Scott doesn t answer. Past Isaac, Derek stands at the 
      other end of the room.

                                  DEREK
                    We need to talk.

      Peter rounds the corner of the locker cages.

                                  PETER
                    All of us.

                                  SCOTT
                    Holy shhhh---

      INT. ARGENT HOME/BASEMENT - NIGHT55

      Stiles holds a finger to his lips.

                                  STILES
                    Shhhhh.

      But as he reaches for the BLACK BINDINGS around Erica s 
      hands, both she and Boyd continue making muffled protests 
      beneath their gags.

      Stiles grabs the binding and--A BLUE SPARK OF ELECTRICITY 
      LIGHTS the room. Stiles leaps up, snatching his hand away 
      with a YELP.

                                  GERARD (O.S.)
                    They were trying to warn you it s 
                      electrified.

      Gerard casually steps down the stairs into the basement.

                                  STILES
                    What are you doing with them?

                                  GERARD
                    At the moment, just keeping them 
                      comfortable. There s no point in 
                    torturing them. They won t give 
                    Derek up. The instinct to protect 
                    their Alpha is too strong.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/127.

                                  STILES
                    Okay... What are you going to do 
                    with me?

                                  GERARD
                    I m not going to kill you if that s 
                    what you re thinking.

                                  STILES
                    Good. Because Scott can find me. He 
                    knows my scent. It s pungent. It s 
                    more like a stench. He could find 
                    me even if I was buried at the 
                    bottom of a sewer, covered in fecal 
                    matter, urine and pure human filth.

                                  GERARD
                    You have a knack for creating a 
                    vivid picture, Mr. Stilinski. Let 
                    me paint one of my own. Scott 
                    McCall finds his best friend 
                    bloodied and beaten to a pulp. 
                    How s that sound?

                                  STILES
                    I d kind of prefer a nice still 
                    life or landscape.

      Gerard closes the distance between them.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    All right, what are you? Ninety? I 
                    bet I could kick your ass up and 
                    down this room--

      Gerard STRIKES him. Fast and shockingly brutal, the blow 
      sends Stiles to the floor.

      Boyd and Erica watch helplessly as Stiles turns to look up. 
      With almost a look of pity, Gerard grabs Stiles by his 
      lacrosse shirt and drags him up.

                    Okay, wait, wait--

      But Gerard strikes him again. And again.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT66

      Isaac behind him, Scott keeps a cautious gaze on Peter and 
      Derek at the other end of the locker room.

                                  SCOTT
                    What the hell is this?

                    You know, I thought the same thing 
                    when I saw you talking to Gerard at 
                    the Sheriff s Station.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, hold on. He threatened to 
                    kill my mom. And I needed to get 
                    close to him. What was I supposed 
                    to do?

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek s uncle. A little while back, 
                    he tried to kill all of us so we 
                    set him on fire and Derek slashed 
                    his throat.

                                  ISAAC

                                  DEREK
                    The short version is he knows how 
                    to stop Jackson. And maybe how to 
                    save him.

                                  ISAAC
                    That should really help now. Since 
                    he s dead.

                                  DEREK
                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    Jackson s dead. It happened on the 
                    field.

                                  ISAAC
                    And it looks like he did it 
                    himself.

      Derek and Peter share a look. Neither seem relieved.

                    Why s nobody taking this as good 
                    news?

                                  PETER
                    Because if Jackson s dead, there s 
                    no way it just happened. Gerard 
                    wanted it to happen.

                                  DEREK
                    But why?

                                  PETER
                    Exactly what we need to find out. 
                    And something tells me the window 
                    of opportunity is closing. Quickly.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT77

      Outside the hall, Argent reaches to knock at the open door 
      when he sees Gerard and Allison inside, talking quietly. 
      Noticing his son, Gerard gives a smile and whispers one last 
      thing into Allison s ear.

                                  ARGENT
                    I saw the lights flicker.

                    feeling the next twenty-four hours 
                    are going to be eventful.

      As he turns, Argent moves just slightly enough to block his 
      way out the door.

                                  ARGENT
                    You going to tell me what happened 
                    at the game?

                    I meant Jackson.

                                  GERARD
                    So did I.

      Argent lets him move past. Now alone with Allison, he 
      approaches, watching her unload the crossbow, darts and her 
      ring knife.

                                    ALLISON

                    I want you to step aside and let us 
                    handle this.

                                    ALLISON

                    Because of Derek. And how do you 
                    think Jackson became that thing in

                    of Derek. Kate, Mom, Jackson--

                    And a new crossbow.

      Allison s knife in hand, he s used it to sever the weapon s 
      string. He sets the broken crossbow down on her desk. 

      With Allison s furious gaze on his back, Argent strides out 
      of the room.

      INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE ROOM - NIGHT88*

      A curtain yanks aside to reveal a BODY BAG lying on a gurney 
      in the dark room. Melissa throws a quick glance behind her to 
      make sure she s alone and then cautiously approaches.

      A CLEAR DROP of what appears to be the Kanima s VENOM seeps 
      from the edge of the BODY BAG and down off the gurney to 
      collect in a thick puddle on the floor.

      Kneeling down, Melissa hesitantly dabs the tip of a pen at 
      the venom. Strangely, it appears to be hardening. 
        Solidifying.

      Rising, Melissa reaches for the zipper of the body bag. Then *

      Phone to his ear, Stilinski rifles through the mess of his

      his room.

                                  LYDIA
                    Hi. Your father let me in.

                                  STILES
                    He did? Of course, he did. That s 
                    good. That s great. Come in.

                                  LYDIA
                    What happened to your...

      She nods to his lip and cheek.

                                  STILES
                    Oh, nothing. Don t worry about it. 
                    I m fine. Totally fine. How are you 
                    doing?

      She meets his eyes and now he notices just how utterly 
      distraught she is.

                                  LYDIA
                    They won t let me see him. I was 
                    supposed to give him something. He 
                    kept asking for it back.

      She opens her hand to reveal she s holding Jackson s HOUSE 
      KEY still attached to a necklace chain. She looks up, tears 
      filling her eyes again.

      INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE ROOM - NIGHT1313

      Under a DIM FLORESCENT LIGHT, Melissa, Scott and Isaac crowd 
      around, all of them focused on the mysterious sight below.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1216.

                    I thought you were going to tell

                                  ISAAC
                    Doesn t look good.

      All three lean in for a closer look at the chrysalis rapidly 
      forming over Jackson s body. Lying perfectly still, Jackson 
      doesn t move. Doesn t even breathe. Until--

      His head SHUDDERS violently. Everyone SCREAMS, jumping back. 
      A strange GURGLING emanates from inside the bag. A wet 
      wheezing sound.

                                  SCOTT
                    Zip it back up. Mom, zip it.

                    Okay, okay--

      Melissa yanks the zipper but it gets stuck. Jackson s mouth 
      begins to open, revealing the Kanima s FANGS.

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom, zip. Zip, Mom, zip--

      Finally she yanks it closed. In the silence, the three of 
      them stare down at the body bag, waiting.

                      Apparently what we ve seen of 
                    Jackson so far is just the Kanima s

                                  DEREK
                    Meaning what? It can turn into

      EXT. METAL WORKS - NIGHT2828

      HEADLIGHTS blaze over a collection of warehouses in a metal 
      works yard. Argent s SUV turns in and comes to a stop.

      Scott and Isaac quickly get out with Argent following. They 
      open the back and pull the body bag from the SUV.

                                  ISAAC
                    I think he stopped moving.

      They gently set the body on the pavement and glance around.

                    Where s Derek?

      Scott turns, listening. He hears him before he sees him. 
      Hands and feet POUNDING the pavement. Argent, Isaac and Scott 
      turn to see a FIGURE loping toward them. 

      Moving with grace and speed, Derek leaps up as if to attack. 
      But then flips back down right to his feet with a low GROWL 
      and a flash of his RED EYES.

      From the CORNER OF A BUILDING, Peter rolls his own eyes.

                                  PETER
                    Somebody certainly enjoys making an 
                    entrance.

      Derek focuses his gaze on Argent.

                                  ARGENT
                    I m here for Jackson. Not you.

                    Somehow, I don t find that very 
                      comforting.

      Maintaining a distance, Peter skirts the edges of the 
      warehouse, coming closer as Derek approaches the body bag.

                    you knew how to save him.

                    What about Lydia--

                                  DEREK
                    Think about it, Scott. Gerard 
                    controls him now. He s made Jackson 
                    his personal guard dog. And he put 
                    all this in motion so that Jackson 
                    could become even bigger and more 
                    powerful.

                                  ARGENT
                    No...

      The others turn to a very concerned looking Argent.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    He wouldn t do that. If Jackson s a 
                    dog, then he s turning rabid. And 
                    my father wouldn t let a rabid dog 
                    live.

                                  GERARD (O.S.)
                    Of course not.

      Gerard steps out of the shadows.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Something that dangerous, that out-
                      of-control... is better off dead.

      A HAND springs up from the body bag, CLAWS digging into 
      Derek s chest. As he spits blood, ROARING in agony, a 
      partially transformed Jackson stands, lifting Derek right 
      over his head like he weighed nothing.

      Argent and Scott race to get out of the way as Derek goes 
      flying past them, SLAMMING BRUTALLY into a steel wall.

      Scott slowly retreats from Gerard.

                                  GERARD
                    Well done to the last, Scott. Like 
                    the concerned friend you are, you 
                    brought Jackson to Derek to save 
                    him. You just didn t realize you 
                    were also bringing Derek to me.

      ARROWS SOAR past Gerard. Scott blinks, glancing back to see 
      Isaac fall, hit in the leg and stomach.

                    Allison--

      But he only catches a glimpse of her before she slips around 
      a corner and into the shadows.

      Argent yanks his gun from its holster, FIRING round after 
      round at the Kanima as it springs up. The creature takes a 
      hit, but manages to slip around the SUV.

      Clip dropping to the pavement, Argent reloads and BLOWS THE 
      WINDOWS out of the SUV, trying to hit the creature.

      Gerard watches, almost amused.

      Before Argent can pull the trigger again, the Kanima s tail 
      snakes out, WRAPPING around the barrel of the gun. A second 
      later the weapon flies into the air and--

      Argent goes down, knocked across the pavement.

      The Kanima spins around to face Derek, back on his feet and 
      now a full werewolf. His SNARL of RAGE is joined by two 
      others--

      Scott and Isaac. Also transformed.

      The three wolves circle the Kanima. One after another they 
      launch their attack. Vicious bites, claws raking across 
      scaled skin. 

      But they re far out-matched.

      Even as Derek launches off the ground for a last assault--the 
      Kanima ducks down and slashes his torso to ribbons.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1229.

      Crashing to the ground amid a SPRAY OF BLOOD DROPLETS, Derek 
      sinks, unable to rise again.

      Isaac charges to defend his Alpha when Allison slips in front 
      of him with the ring knife. The slashes come with blinding 
      speed. Knife circling up and around, Allison steps back 
      allowing Isaac to collapse in front of her.

      But she doesn t hear him. Steadily approaching Derek. Raising

      himself.

      swings the knife. 

      The hand of the Kanima.

      From his hiding spot, Peter looks out, unwilling to join the 
      fray, but watching with curiosity.

      Allison s tears run over the Kanima s claws at her own throat 
      while she watches Scott drag Derek up.

                                  DEREK
                    Scott, stop. Don t--Scott!

      Digging his claws into the back of Derek s neck, Scott forces 
      him to open his mouth and reveal his fangs.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m sorry. But I have to.

      Approaching them, a frighteningly calm Gerard begins to roll 
      up his sleeve. Scott holds Derek in position as Gerard 
      carefully places his arm between the Alpha s teeth.

      Gerard gives a nod and Scott shoves Derek s head forward, *
      sending his teeth sinking into the pale flesh of the man s *
      arm. Derek s eyes FLARE WITH A BRILLIANT RED. As Gerard tears 
      free, the Alpha collapses back.*

      With an amused laugh, Gerard holds up his bloody arm for the 
      others to see. But the looks of horror in Argent and 
      Allison s eyes turn to puzzlement.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1232.

      Even at his distance, Peter notes something unusual.

                                  PETER
                    What the...

      Seeing their faces, Gerard lowers his arm. BLACK BLOOD seeps 
      over the red. Dripping off his forearm to the concrete floor 
      at his feet.

                                  GERARD
                    What...

      Derek s eyes widen as Gerard coughs, BLACK BLOOD appearing at 
      his lips.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    What is this? What did you do?

                                  SCOTT
                    Everyone kept telling me Gerard 
                    always has a plan. Well...

      Scott raises his eyes to reveal a now confident, even 
      triumphant gaze.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    I had a plan too.

      Gerard yanks his SILVER PILL BOX from his pocket.

                                  GERARD
                    No... no...

      He pours several capsules into his hand, some spilling to the 
      floor around him--

      Scott holds out Gerard s pill box.

                    You dropped this.

      INT. METAL WORKS - NIGHT3131

      BLACK BLOOD now running from his nose, Gerard raises a 
      handful of the CAPSULES and crushes them in his hand. The 
      capsules burst into a puff of GRAY ASH--

                                  GERARD
                    Mountain ash.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1233.

      With Scott by his side, Deaton pours the gray ash from the 
      bottle marked with the ROWAN symbol into the CAPSULE FILLING 
      MACHINE, carefully filling a dozen of Gerard s pills.

      INT. METAL WORKS - NIGHT3333

      Scott steps back as Gerard sinks to his knees, lurching in 
      agony. Black blood pours from his nose, from his tear ducts, 
      ears, even around his fingernails. Spilling to the floor as--

      Head thrown back, Gerard SHRIEKS in pain as he spits up a 
      streaming fountain of BLACK BLOOD.

      The others retreat in terror, scrambling away from the 
      macabre display.

      Only Scott watches unblinking, knowing and expecting the 
      effect. Derek peers at him with a mixture of shock and most 
      surprisingly, respect.

                                  DEREK
                    Why didn t you tell me?

                                  SCOTT
                    Because you might be an Alpha. But 
                    you re not mine.

      He steps forward as if to help Gerard up. But with the blood 
      still dripping from his lips, the senior Argent raises his 
      hate-filled eyes and looks to the Kanima.

                                  GERARD
                    Kill them.

      Veins pulling taut at his neck, he shouts with every last bit 
      of strength he has.

      FADE IN:

      INT. METAL WORKS - NIGHT3434

      Gerard collapses down as just a few feet away--Allison wrests 
      the Kanima s hand free from her neck and pushes off. But with 
      its other claw, the creature sends her sprawling. 

      It whirls about to face Scott for the attack when--

      The roar of a VEHICLE S ENGINE fills the warehouse. The 
      Kanima spins at the sound of BRAKES SQUEALING and HURTLES 
      BACK, tossed right off its feet by--

      A blue Jeep.

      Eyes squeezed shut, Stiles looks up from the wheel and turns 
      to the others.

                                  STILES
                    Did I get him?

      Scott almost laughs. But then the Kanima LEAPS onto the hood 
      of the Jeep hand swinging a clawed hand up with a shriek.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson!

      The creature pauses, blinking in confusion. The passenger 
      side door of the Jeep creaks open and Lydia steps out. Lit by 
      the headlights of the SUV she almost glows in the darkness.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Jackson?

      Her hands come up. The Kanima pulls back as if to strike her 
      down. But then she opens her hand to show what s held in her 
      palm...

      Jackson s key.

      The creature blinks as it looks on the key and--

      INT. WHITTEMORE HOME/JACKSON S ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK3535

      Lips parting from a deep kiss, Jackson and Lydia lie back in 
      his bed. She tries to curl up next to him but he reaches for 
      something on the night table.

      He turns back to her with the HOUSE KEY in his hand.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1235.

                                  LYDIA
                    A key to the house? Already?

                                    JACKSON
                    What? It s not a wedding ring.

                                  LYDIA
                    So you re just making me a more 
                      accessible late night booty call?

                                    JACKSON
                    Late night. Late morning. Late 
                      afternoon.

      She laughs, now able to curl up against him. Pressing the key 
      into her palm, she allows herself a smile. Unseen behind her, 
      the look in Jackson s eyes is the same.

      Neither willing to say it or let the other see it, they re 
      both, nevertheless, perfectly and utterly in love.

      INT. METAL WORKS - NIGHT3636

      The Kanima's eyes blink back to HUMAN EYES, the eyes of 
      Jackson, now half transformed again.

      Lydia gives him one last look of regret, as if knowing what s 
      about to happen.

      Jackson slowly turns to face Derek who is now standing once 
      again. Jackson lowers his clawed hands, lowering his 
      defenses. Purposefully making himself vulnerable to attack.

      Derek grabs the moment and strikes, DIGGING his claws into 
      Jackson s ribcage.

      Seeing his chance, Peter rushes out and guts Jackson from the 
      back. As the wolf hands tear back, Jackson staggers forward 
      and--

      Lydia takes hold of him before he can fall. Struggling to 
      keep him up, she slowly guides him to his knees.

      Red blood--human blood--on his torso, Jackson looks on her 
      with his own eyes, seeming to recognize her. Then he whispers 
      a question.

                                    JACKSON
                    Do you... still...          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1236.

      CONTINUED:3636

      He can't seem to find the strength or breath to finish. 
      Lydia, however, knows what he was asking.

                                  LYDIA
                    I do. I still love you.

      Finally, Jackson s eyes close and his head gently rests on 
      her shoulder.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    I still love you.

      The others watch silently as she holds Jackson there. Only 
      when his hand opens and releases the key to the ground does 
      she finally let him lie.

      As gently as he can, Stiles takes Lydia s arm and helps her 
      up. She turns into him, trying to find comfort in his arms.

                                    ALLISON
                    Where s Gerard?

      Argent looks over. The others follow Allison s eyes to a pool 
      of black blood and the faint trace of footsteps. He s gone. 

                                  ARGENT
                    I doubt he s far.

      Now human, Derek helps Isaac back to his feet. Finally, they 
      begin moving, an exhausted group of people turning to go.

      But then the SOUND OF CLAWS scratching cement catches their 
      attention. Lydia turns first to see--

      Jackson s hands moving. Claws at his fingertips, they scratch 
      at the pavement as life begins to tremble its way back into 
      his body, wounds already beginning to heal on his torso.

      Head lifting up, he sucks in a breath as if coming up for air 
      after diving into water.

      Scott, Derek and Peter brace themselves for a new attack. But 
      something different happens.

      When Jackson opens his eyes, they begin to glow. No longer 
      slitted and reptilian, they burn an intense BLUE. His mouth 
      draws open to reveal FANGS growing. Not two rows, but pairs 
      of uppers and lowers.

      As he pushes up to his knees, strands of hair appear at his 
      cheeks, growing toward the ears which now taper out to 
      points.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1237.

      CONTINUED:3636

      With the others watching in silent awe, Jackson finally 
      stands. And finally becomes... a WEREWOLF.

      A PRIMAL ROAR fills the metal works as Jackson cries out at 
      the night like a bird spreading its wings for the first time.

      His eyes dim back to normal, claws retracting. He lowers his 
      head and breathlessly looks to the others. Somehow alive. 
      They stare back at him, incredulous.

      Finally Lydia runs into his arms. Scott and the others 
      breathe in relief. Except for Stiles.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

      The first whisper of sunrise begins to spill into Allison s 
      room. Fingers intertwined, she and Scott sit on the edge of 
      her bed in silence.

                                    ALLISON
                    I m sorry.

                                  SCOTT
                    You don t have to say sorry.

                                    ALLISON
                    I do. I have to. For what I did 
                    What I said. For everything. And 
                      especially for what I have to do 
                    now.

      Disentangling her fingers from his, she looks into his eyes.

                    It s okay.

      She looks in his eyes, finding no trace of uncertainty.

                                    ALLISON
                    There s no such thing as fate.

      Tears slipping down her cheeks, Allison actually breathes a 
      small laugh. Scott gently brushes her tears away and then 
      presses his lips softly to hers. A short, but sweet kiss. 
      Allison breaks it, pulling back and opening her eyes to look 
      at him.

      Finally, Scott rises from the bed and turns for the door 
      where he sees Argent waiting. 

      As he passes by, Allison s father gives him the slightest of 
      nods. The closest to a thank you Argent can manage at the 
      moment.

      Scott gives a last look back to watch Argent sit next to 
      Allison on the edge of the bed. He puts his arm around her 
      and she gently rests his head on his shoulder, glancing up to 
      find the doorway empty. 

      Scott is gone.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1239.


      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3838

      Racing through the woods, breathless and frightened, Erica 
      notices Boyd beginning to slow down.

      He trails off. Both of them, slowly looking up to find 
      they re not alone.

      A WOMAN dressed in black stands at the opposite edge of the 
      clearing. Stepping into the light, she s immediately 
        recognizable as the Ambulance Driver who allowed Melissa to 
      ride along to the hospital.

      Erica and Boyd look on her, confused. Especially since she 
      does not seem at all surprised to see them.

                                  WOMAN
                    Lost?

      Erica and Boyd begin to slowly back up. But behind them--

      A SILHOUETTED FIGURE steps out from between the trees, black 
      shoes that don t look like they belong anywhere near the 
      woods crush leaves underneath.

      A second SILHOUETTE emerges. And then a third, a fourth and 
      fifth surrounding the frightened Boyd and Erica.

      They stand there, dark-clothed monoliths, terrifying in their 
      stillness and quiet. And then--

      A FIST snaps open to reveal CLAWS on the right hand of one of 
      the strangers. His left hand snaps open as well with the same 
      result.

      A CHORUS OF UNSHEATHING rises through the clearing as one 
      hand after another snaps open to reveal sharpened claws. A 
      display of power that culminates with sudden SNARLING and 
      GROWLING.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1240.

      TRISKELE. But different than the one tattooed to Derek s 
      back. Sharper, more aggressive.

                                  DEREK
                    It s their symbol. And it means 
                    they re coming.

                    Who?

                                  DEREK
                    Alphas.

                                  ISAAC
                    More than one?

                                  PETER
                    An Alpha pack. And they re not 
                    coming. They re already here.

      The three of them turn to eye the jagged TRISKELE on the door 
      while through the woods, somewhere not far off--

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - DAY4040

      An old blue Jeep rumbles to a stop between the bleachers on 
      an empty field. Scott and Stiles jump out and begin pulling 
      lacrosse gear from the back.

                                  STILES
                    You really think she s going to 
                    come back to you?

                                  SCOTT
                    I know she is. What about you and 
                    Lydia?

                                  STILES
                    The ten year plan for making Lydia 
                    fall in love with me might have had 
                    to stretch to fifteen, but the plan 
                    remains in motion.

                                  SCOTT
                    Why don t you just ask her out?

                                  STILES
                    Why don t you just get into goal 
                    and help me make captain like you 
                    promised?

      Stiles drops a bag full of lacrosse balls onto the grass 
      while Scott takes his position at goal.

                                  SCOTT
                    You know what I just realized? I m 
                    right back where I started.

                                  STILES
                    What do you mean?

                                  SCOTT
                    I mean no lacrosse. No popularity. 
                    No girlfriend. Nothing.

                                  STILES
                    Dude. You still got me.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1242.

                                  SCOTT
                    I had you before.

                                  STILES
                    And you ve still got me. Life 
                      fulfilled.

      Ball in the pocket of his lacrosse stick, Stiles takes a 
      shooting stance.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Now remember. No wolf powers.

                                  SCOTT
                    Got it.

                                  STILES
                    No super-fast reflexes, super eye-
                    sight, hearing, none of that crap.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay.

      Stiles winds back, but pauses again.

                                  STILES
                    You promise?

                                  SCOTT
                    Will you just take a shot already!

      Finally, with every bit of strength and concentration he can 
      muster, Stiles sends the ball flying.

      The world goes BLACK and is immediately followed by the 
      distinct sound of a BALL being caught in the net of a 
      lacrosse stick.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    I said no wolf powers!

                                                                          FADE OUT:
