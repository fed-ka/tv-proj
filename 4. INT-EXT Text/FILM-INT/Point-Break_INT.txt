BLACK SEDAN
TWO MEN and ONE WOMAN in SUSPENDED TIME put on overcoats
and hats.
Under their hats strips of Scotch tape stretch
taut from the base of their nose to their forehead,
hideously distorting their features.
Makes them look like
human PIGS.
BLACK SEDAN
An M-16 clip is SMACKED into place and cocked with a
CACHACK!
Ammo clips are SNICK-SNICKED into handgun butts
and a long clip is SSSNICKED into an UZI.
Watches are checked.
The PIG NOSE people nod to each
other.
BANK
--BAAAAAAMMM!
Glass doors explode OPEN and Pig Nose #1 SPINS inside.
He
fires a burst into the ceiling.
BRRAAMM!!
PIG NOSE #1
EVERYBODY on the floor!
PEOPLE drop.
VERY FAST HERE--
Two bandits handle BANK EMPLOYEES and customers--
Another PIG NOSE watches the door--
Pig Nose #1 moves behind counter, Uzi and canvas sack in
hand.
SURVEILLANCE VAN
Dark. Monitors SHOW SLOW SCANS of the bank INTERIOR.
Two MEN wear headphones and black windbreakers with FBI
stenciled on the back.
One watches with binoculars.
BINOCULARS
Bingo.
We're on.
Let's go.
Where's the big college
quarterback?!
Are you with us,
Utah?
BANK
Pig Nose #1 LEAPS over the counter, holds a canvas sack
filled with booty from tellers' drawers.
PIG NOSE #1
Fuckin' shake it!
Pig Nose #2 nods with his snubby nose, hurries toward the
exit.
TAXI
A flood of orange through the windshield as the cab crawls
down Ocean Park to the sea.
CAMERA HANDHELD from the back
seat.
The driver turns to us.
DRIVER
Anywhere?
You don't care?
UTAH (V.O.)
Anywhere.
I've just never seen the
ocean before.
CUT TO:
FEDERAL BUILDING - FBI BULLPEN
Supervising Agent BEN HARP leads Utah across the bullpen.
Rows of desks.
Agents sitting at computer terminals.
Data hell.
Looks like he got a job at Xerox.
HARP
You know less than nothing.
If you
even knew that you knew nothing, at
least that would be something, but
you don't.
UTAH
Yes, sir.
Utah is wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase.
Harp is
mid-thirties, confident of stride, tanned of skin, perfect
of hair.
GQ.
Aggressive.
HARP
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
UTAH
Sir?
HARP
All the food groups?
Avoiding
sugar?
Caffeine?
I see to it that
my people maintain cardiovascular
fitness.
We stay off hard liquor,
cigarettes...
UTAH
(poker face)
I take the skin off chicken.
Harp glances at him, eyes narrowing.
They reach a
glassed-in compound of small offices.
Harp swings the
door open and the other agents look up as Utah enters.
HARP
This is us.
Bank Robbery.
And
you're in the bank-robbery capital
of the world--
UTAH
1322 last year in LA county.
Up 26
percent from the year before.
HARP
That's right.
And we nailed over a
thousand of them.
We did it by
crunching data.
Good crime-scene
work, good lab work, good data-base
analysis.
Nobody had to tackle a
car once.
You getting the signal,
special agent?
UTAH
Zero distortion, sir.
He picks up a donut from someone's desk, a succulent
glazed jelly.
UTAH
I love these things.
He looks right at Harp.
Takes a big fuck-you bite.
HARP
You're a real blue-flame special,
aren't you, Utah?
I don't know why
they sent you to LA.
Must be an
asshole shortage.
UTAH
Not so far.
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER
A blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines.
VOOM!
A figure rockets down INTO FRAME in a curtain of
bubbles.
A gawky AGENT, in less than stylish FBI trunks,
flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom
of a pool.
GYMNASIUM POOL - DAY
The pool casts wavy distortions upon TWO DOZEN MEN, all
grumbling as they stand in line, wearing T-shirts with FBI
logos, sweats and sneakers.
We hear a splash, and the men
shuffle forward.
PAPPAS (V.O.)
The dolls love this baby.
It brings
them luck when they rub it -- right
between their buttons.
CLOSE ON tape measure wrapped around a generous belly.
PULL BACK to reveal VETERAN AGENT COREY measuring the
ample waist of ANGELO PAPPAS.
This 54 year old silver
haired Greek stands rubbing his belly like a Zulu chief.
COREY
Angelo, we need a bigger tape.
PAPPAS
Just read the goddamn number.
COREY
Still a 46.
Maybe we can cinch it
down, wear a girdle--
PAPPAS
Screw you and this holistic fitness
crap!
At least my arms don't flap
in the wind.
Corey secretly squeezes his bicep as...
A whistle blows.
A broad shouldered MAN wearing an FBI
cap barks at the Greek.
BIG SHOULDERS
Okay, Pappas, let's put on the
blindfold.
Wanna see you retrieve
at least two bricks from the bottom.
JOHNNY UTAH enters the pool area in the distance.
Says
something to one of the agents.
Is pointed toward us as--
Corey ties the blindfold and guides Pappas to the edge of
the pool.
PAPPAS
I've been in the field 33 years,
fired my piece 23 times in the line
of duty, and I got no idea what a
blind man fetching bricks has gotta
do with being a Special Agent!
Johnny has walked up.
Pappas, blindfolded, turns directly
to Utah as he continues, thinking it's Corey.
PAPPAS
Added to which indignity, I got
three months left to retirement and
they saddle me with some blue-flamer
fresh out of Quantico for a partner.
Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas
or something.
UTAH
The shit they pull, huh?
Pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the pool.
Huge backblast of water.
The other agents hoot and
holler.
Corey swears and wipes off his clipboard.
Johnny steps to the edge, looks down.
We see the blindfolded Pappas groveling along the bottom.
The other agents cheer as Pappas heads for the surface.
COREY
Here he comes.
Hold up a fish,
he'll take it right outta your hand.
Pappas surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters
for breath.
He grabs the edge and angrily slaps two
bricks on the tiles.
He rips off the blindfold looks up
and frowns.
A HAND ENTERS FRAME to help him up.
Pappas takes it and
Johnny hauls him on deck.
COREY
Hey Shamu, this is your guy.
Pappas eyes the new agent warily.
Extends his hand.
PAPPAS
Pappas.
Angelo Pappas.
UTAH
Punk.
Quarterback Punk.
PAPPAS
(grinning)
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
SEDAN - DAY
SERIES OF TIGHT SHOTS
ECU sweep hand of a dive watch clicks through the
seconds.
Magnum shells are fed into a pump shotgun.
Velcro straps of Second Chance body armor are fastened.
White gloves are pulled snug over strong hands.
A silk tie is straightened.
A shotgun slide is cocked.
The sweep hand approaches the twelve.
A LATEX MASK is pulled over the back of a man's head.
VOICE
The little hand says...
The mask turns into FULL CLOSE-UP.
It is RONALD REAGAN.
REAGAN
... let's rock and roll.
BANK OF AMERICA
Business as usual.
The scene so normal you know something
is about to happen.
An exiting MAN stuffs bucks into his
wallet, reaching for the door which--
SLAMS INWARD.
He is hit by a wall of EX-PRESIDENTS.
REAGAN charges in with his buddies RICHARD M. NIXON,
LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON and JOHN F. KENNEDY.
Reagan throws the poor guy skidding across the floor.
Nixon buttstrokes a guard, hard in the nuts, with his 12
gauge.
The other guard goes for his holster -- finds himself
facing three shotguns and one very large handgun.
Reagan sights down the pistol.
REAGAN
Use a gun, go to heaven.
The guard freezes.
White and sweaty.
Tricky Dick slips up to him and collects the pistol.
Kennedy covers the stunned customers.
Johnson backs up against the door jam, watching the
street, and the sedan idling at the curb.
REAGAN
EVERYBODY FREEZE!!
That's right.
ALL TELLERS step back from the
counter!
Hands on heads!
MOVE!!
Nixon and Reagan move quickly to the counter as the
tellers comply.
REAGAN
Everybody else on the floor!
Do it!
On the floor, let's go.
NIXON
SUCK LINOLEUM, BITCH!!
You got
earwax?!
Nixon grabs a stunned woman by the arm and hurls her to
the floor.
She lands hard.
Everyone is on the deck by now.
The Presidents move fast.
Reagan leaps onto the counter.
Stands up where he can see
all.
Nixon hurdles to tellers' side and they start moving down
the line together.
Reagan controlling the room as Nixon
quickly empties the tellers' cash drawers into the sack.
His hands move like lightning.
REAGAN
Just stay cool.
Everybody stay
cool.
Heads down.
Eyes down.
The
money's insured--
TIGHT ON -- MONEY flying into the sack.
REAGAN
-- it's not worth dying for.
Another 45 seconds of your time.
That's all.
Then -- Whoa, Tricky
Dick!
Nixon pulls a pack of twenties back out of the bag and
tosses it to the BANK MANAGER.
Who reflexively catches
it.
Then drops it like a hot-potato just before--
It EXPLODES into a cloud of blue ink.
The manager is dyed
blue.
Burnt money showers on the terrified customers.
LBJ looks at his watch and WHISTLES.
The bandits sprint for the front doors.
Kennedy exits first, followed by Reagan.
LBJ pauses under the surveillance camera, drops his
trousers and MOONS.
Thank you is written across his white
butt.
BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITOR--
High angle, distorted wide shot.
LBJ hoists his pants and
splits, followed out by Nixon, who exits backward with the
famous double peace-sign held high overhead.
IMAGE FREEZES.
Victorious Nixon, grainy... something from
a time warp.
The image SUDDENLY GOES INTO HIGH-SPEED
REVERSE.
The bank robbery sequence zips backward.
PAPPAS (V.O.)
Twenty-seven banks in three years.
In and out in 90 seconds.
Nobody
ever gets shot.
We're talking solid
professionals.
WE ARE IN--
BANK CRIME SCENE - LATER
UTAH & PAPPAS are watching a monitor in the glassed-in
office.
The robbery REPLAYS on grainy BLACK & WHITE
videotape.
The bandits barge in, raise shotguns and order everybody
to the floor.
UTAH
Good move.
PAPPAS
Yeah, they control the room well.
Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
VIDEO TAPE -- Utah is reverse-scanning.
The bandits walk
BACKWARD into the bank.
The explosion of blue ink is
sucked back into the pack of money, then leaps back into
President Nixon's hand.
UTAH
They don't go for the vault?
PAPPAS
Never go for the vault.
They never
get greedy.
UTAH
Smart.
You burn time in the vault.
PAPPAS
Reagan usually drives.
Stolen
switch car, they leave it running at
the curb, looks parked from a
distance.
When they run, they dump
the vehicle and vanish.
And I mean
vanish.
Utah stops the video, now FAST-FORWARDING it, stopping
where President Nixon separates the exploding "dye pack"
planted with the money, before he tosses it aside.
UTAH
Surgical.
Look at them separate the
dye packs.
Dick and Ronny know
their jobs.
PAPPAS
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've
seen, kid.
Outside the windowed partition POLICE OFFICERS interview
frightened customers.
Hotshot agents MUNOZ and COLE enter from the main floor of
the bank.
Think they're very slick.
MUNOZ
Anytime you two are finished jerking
off watching MTV I need to get a
look at that tape.
COLE
(sloppy grin)
Hey, Pappas, you tell the kid your
theory on the Presidents?
PAPPAS
Just take the tape, Cole.
Now Munoz starts to smile.
MUNOZ
Hang ten, Pappas, like totally
rad...
(to Utah)
I gotta tell ya, the department
loves it.
UTAH
What's he talking about, Angelo?
Harp raps glass.
Cole and Munoz look sharp.
Harp enters addressing Pappas and Utah.
HARP
They found the drop car up on
Mulholland.
I want you two to go
work it.
PAPPAS
What?
Now I'm working the drop car?
Who's handling the scene here?
HARP
Cole and Munoz.
I'm uh... letting
them run with the ball for a while.
Cole and Munoz gloat.
PAPPAS
Cole and Munoz?
I been on this case
for two years.
HARP
(zeroing in on
Pappas)
That's the point, isn't it?
PAPPAS
Yeah, I get it.
Time to play let's
dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
HARP
Supervising Special Agent, Harp.
Now I want you to go work the drop
car, okay, Angelo?
Okay?
The Greek rises like a proud bull.
PAPPAS
Sure.
No problem.
How about your
office?
Your office need vacuuming?
We could do that too.
Pappas and Utah move toward the door.
It's a tight
squeeze as they pass Cole and Munoz.
Especially Pappas.
PAPPAS
Excuse me.
Read as fuck you.
SEDAN FRONT SEAT
FLASHLIGHT BEAM prowls the interior, stopping on a small
printed card, folded like a pup tent, left upon the bench
seat.
It reads "Sanitized For Your Protection."
PAPPAS
Cute huh?
They love to fuck with
us.
UTAH & PAPPAS pull their heads out of the sedan.
Forensic
expert, HALSEY, stands behind them.
PAPPAS
Don't tell me, let me guess.
The
switch-car was stolen this morning...
(Halsey is nodding
his head)
They vacuumed and 409'd the
interior, did the windows, emptied
the ashtrays...
HALSEY
Yeah, the usual drill.
Utah pulls on a rubber glove and lifts the card off the
seat.
Studies it.
Talks to Halsey like Halsey's the one
that just out of Quantico, not Utah.
UTAH
Could've taken their gloves off
before setting that card.
Laser it
for prints.
Maybe held it to his
teeth -- check the edges for saliva.
(a beat)
Today was a scorcher.
This Chevy
doesn't have air conditioning...
HALSEY
Sweat secretions in the seatbacks?
PAPPAS
You through, Mr. Wizard?
Let me
know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under
the seat while you're at it.
(looks at his watch)
Hell, it's only 7:30.
The night's
still young... you can solve this
case and start on another one.
UTAH
Well, what're your ideas on these
guys?
PAPPAS
Forget about it, kid.
They're
ghosts.
Let the goddamn yuppie
Mormon affirmative action assholes
handle it.
See I'm almost 55... so
I must be senile, right?
They
better get me out before I start
pissing myself in public.
Drooling.
It would look bad for the Bureau,
right?
UTAH
So you're gonna coast to retirement,
when you could nail these guys and
go out with come dignity.
PAPPAS
You watch your fucking mouth!
(pounds his chest)
Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal
of Honor right here!
The two men glare at each other.
Utah looks away.
UTAH
Sorry.
PAPPAS
Yeah.
That was thirty years ago
anyway.
(stares out at the
bright horizon)
L.A.'s changed a lot since then.
The air got dirty and the sex got
clean.
(after a beat)
So you want to nail the Ex-
Presidents?
Be a big hero?
UTAH
Yeah.
What's your theory?
PAPPAS
The fucking punks are surfers.
CUT TO:
GRAINY BLACK & WHITE VIDEO WITH TIME CODE
Ex-Presidents charge into bank, raise shotguns.
Image STOPS, then FAST-FORWARDS to the end.
WE ARE IN--
FEDERAL BUILDING - BULLPEN - NIGHT
Dark, lit by the TV at the far end of the bullpen.
PAPPAS
and UTAH sit in front of the flickering Sony in the big
empty room.
Angelo punches a button on the VCR.
ON THE SCREEN--
LBJ turns his back to the fish-eye lens, drops trousers
and moons the camera.
Thank you.
Angelo FREEZES on LBJ'S butt.
PAPPAS
I'm tellin' ya, kid, it's in our
face.
Lookit the tan on this guy.
The young agent looks forward.
Stares at the white inscribed butt bracketed by deep
bronze tan lines.
UTAH
Oh well he must be a surfer.
PAPPAS
Shutup, you might learn somethin'
you're not careful... So last year
Nixon scuffs a counter going over.
There was a soil sample.
Non-
specific mud traces of asphalt,
oils, blah, blah... sand and...
carnuba wax.
So I became a wax
expert.
There's 80 some uses for
this stuff, something like five
hundred products.
He tosses Utah a ream of computer printout.
Utah scans
lists of brand names.
UTAH
Candle wax.
Car wax.
Mustache wax?
Could be anything.
Guy's waxing his
mustache at the beach.
Gets sand in
it.
Wipes it off with a shoe.
Shoe
scuffs the counter.
PAPPAS
The lab made three possible matches,
this was one of 'em.
Pappas opens his desk drawer, takes something out and
throws it to Johnny.
A pastel blue hockey puck wrapped in
cellophane.
A block of "Mr. Zog's Sex Wax".
UTAH
(reading)
Sex wax?
You're not into kinky
shit, are you Angelo?
PAPPAS
Surfers use it on their boards.
They rub sand into it for traction.
UTAH
Thanks for the tip.
I needed this
knowledge.
Pappas shoves a thick file folder toward Utah.
PAPPAS
Now lookit the dates on the
robberies.
This is strictly a
summer job for these guys.
Johnny leafs through it.
UTAH
... Four months.
June to October.
Mmmm...same the year before.
PAPPAS
Another month and we don't see 'em
again 'til next summer.
Utah stares at Angelo as it dawns.
Grins suddenly.
UTAH
They're traveling the rest of the
year on the money, going where the
waves are...
Pappas starts to smile.
Suddenly, he jumps up onto his
desk, gets down in a speed-crouch, arms extended.
PAPPAS
(to one and all)
The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to
finance their endless summer!
Johnny watches, grinning.
The night security GUARD walks
in.
Utah turns to the guard, shrugs.
UTAH
I think he needs a vacation.
The guard nods understanding.
CUT TO:
SURFSHOP - MALIBU PIER - DAY
Long stack-up rack of gleaming SURFBOARDS.
A HAND reaches in, pulling out a board from the middle of
the deck.
JOHNNY UTAH hefts it.
Sights along it.
Trying to look
familiar with alien equipment.
Behind him is a whip-thin
15 YEAR OLD SALESMAN.
Nut-brown with platinum hair,
jammed day-glo shorts, sleeveless T-shirt, unlaced Ug-
boots.
15
Highest performance, very kind.
If
you want to get aggro, man, this
stick can handle your best rage.
Where you surf?
UTAH
I don't.
15
Whoa!!
Back up!
This's a 5'6" tri-
fin squash-tail thruster.
You'd eat
major shit on this, dude.
ACROSS THE ROOM we see Pappas trying on purple wraparound
sunglasses.
The salespunk pulls down a wide board with a garish
firebird paint scheme.
Like a lowrider flame-job.
The
logo reads "Dance with the Universe."
15
Here, you need a rhino chaser like
this one to learn on.
Good board.
I mean for a pig board.
Utah hefts the board.
Scowls.
Hates anything he's not
great at.
PAPPAS sets his purchases on a counter: the glasses, some
plutonium-pink shorts, T-shirts, sun-block.
The GIRL
behind the counter is sixteen, barely contained in a
macrame bikini-top and "Dolphin" shorts.
Angelo picks up
a package of Sex Wax from a rack.
Sniffs it.
PAPPAS
(reading the label)
"Best for your stick", huh?
This
might not be enough.
I better get
two.
The girl stifles a grin.
Thinks he's cute.
At the other
end of the counter, 15 is ringing up Utah's board.
15
Hey, man, guys your age learning to
surf, it's cool, there's nothing
wrong with it.
UTAH
I'm twenty-five.
15
See that's what I'm saying, it's
never too late.
Utah picks up the board and moves to leave.
15
Hope you stay with it.
Surfin's
the source.
It'll change your life.
Swear to God.
UTAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Johnny dead asleep.
Silence.
Then BRRRRR!!
He jacknifes up like he just took 20,000 volts.
His eyes
read panic.
He rolls up, legs scissor against tangled
sheets and he collapses over empty boxes.
He stumbles
like a blind man through the mess until he finds--
A tiny Indianapolis Colts FOOTBALL HELMET with a digital
clock for eyes.
5:00 a.m.
Johnny emits a drawn out
groan.
COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
Green glow washes the intent faces of Utah and Pappas as
MISS DEER data specialist, enters 867 CDH into her
computer.
She is purebred American Indian, strong featured and
beautiful.
The screen freezes and the hard disk churns.
The DMV rap sheet scrolls down the screen.
PAPPAS
This is your surfer contact?
Female.
Blond hair.
Green eyes.
5'6".
119 lbs?
MISS DEER
Hmm, not bad, Utah.
UTAH
Tyler Ann Endicott.
Born 11-27-64.
The rap sheet scrolls and scrolls and scrolls.
There is
something frightening about the length of this file.
UTAH
(reading from the
screen)
... Exhibition of speed.
Indecent
exposure inside moving vehicle...
MISS DEER
Hot, very hot.
UTAH
Felony arrest!
"See adjoining
file"...
(he types quickly)
Kidnapping?!
Pappas crowds over Johnny's shoulder, reading.
PAPPAS
This is great.
She ties some guy
up.
Nude.
Leaves the scene and
fails to return for 24 hours.
No
convection.
MISS DEER
Gotta avoid the rope tricks, Johnny.
Utah gives her a "very funny" look.
More data scrolls
forth.
UTAH
What else they got on her?
I still
haven't found anything I can really
use.
I gotta find an approach, a
way in -- here we go...
(he reads)
Both parents deceased.
Plane crash.
San Diego, '84.
Mmmm.
Yeah,
definitely.
CUT TO:
NEPTUNE'S NET
Tyler Endicott is working the counter.
She jams an order
on the wheel and turns TO US.
TYLER
Next!
Oh, no.
REVERSE ON Johnny standing there.
Her only customer.
TYLER
What do you want?
UTAH
Shrimp and fries.
TYLER
I mean, what do you want?
What are
you doing hanging around here.
UTAH
(very serious)
I need you to teach me.
TYLER
Gimme a break.
(to cook)
One shrimp and fries to go!
(to Johnny)
Anything to drink?
UTAH
I'm serious.
TYLER
I can see that.
But forget it.
Stick to tennis, or whatever you're
good at.
Miniature golf.
Here,
your number's 37.
UTAH
Well, I'm just gonna go back out
there till I catch on to it or break
my neck.
She's looking at him.
This guy's nuts.
She laughs.
TYLER
What is it?
You all of a sudden got
this bug you had to go surfing?
This is a line, right?
UTAH
No, no.
See, all my life I've done
things for other people.
In high
school I played football because my
old man expected me to.
Then my
parents always figured I'd go to law
school, so I did.
Football
scholarship.
Graduated Phi Beta
Kappa--
TYLER
This gonna take long?
UTAH
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks,
right?
(he leans forward, a
little awkward)
But two years ago they got killed in
a car wreck and I just suddenly
realized all my goals had been their
goals.
And I hadn't been living my
own life.
So I wanted something for
myself.
Something that maybe didn't
make any sense.
You know what I
mean?
Tyler's smile has faded during this.
He's managed to
touch her, break through the tough-waitress act.
Now
she's looking him right in the eye.
UTAH
I came out here from Ohio a month
ago.
Never saw the ocean before.
I
didn't think it would effect me so
much.
Like I'm drawn to it, or
something.
I want to do what you
do.
It's the truth.
TYLER
Tomorrow, 6 AM.
Here.
If you're a
minute late I'm gone.
(he's grinning)
And Stud... I didn't take you to
raise.
I can show you a few things
but after that you're on your own.
That'll be four fifty.
He plunks down a ten and backs out the door, grinning.
UTAH
Keep the change, Teach.
CUT TO:
FEDERAL BUILDING - 16TH FLOOR - DAY
Utah, in shorts and T-shirt, carries his flame-job
surfboard past surveillance cameras and portraits of Bush,
Hoover and Webster.
Special Agent Cole walks by.
Eyes
the board.
Speaks deadpan.
COLE
Like totally rad stick, dude.
BULLPEN
Utah tries to act casual as he carries the board to his
desk on the other side of the room.
He has to walk past
the entire gauntlet to get there.
SEVERAL AGENTS
Gnarly, man... hang ten...
cowabunga... surf patrol... rip it
up!
Harp comes straight for him like a homing missile.
HARP
How was the beach?
UTAH
Fine.
HARP
Surf conditions okay?
UTAH
A little mushy.
HARP
A little mushy!
You think the
taxpayers would like it, Utah, if
they knew they were paying a federal
agent to surf and pick up girls?
UTAH
Babes.
HARP
What?
UTAH
The correct term is babes, sir.
Uh,
this type of undercover operation is
entirely dependent on picking up the
idiom of the speech.
Otherwise
penetration is not possible, sir.
Of the social infrastructure, I
mean.
Harp inhales through his nose.
A bad sign.
HARP
Where is Pappas?
Utah points across the room.
Harp turns.
PAPPAS, sitting behind his desk in his "Surf This" T-shirt
and pink shorts, lifts the purple Vuarnets like Tom Cruise
in Risky Business.
Looks directly at Harp.
Smiles innocently.
HARP'S OFFICE
Harp paces.
Type-A suppressed rage.
Utah and Pappas endure Harp's wrath.
HARP
Special Agent Utah, this is not some
job flippin' burgers at the drive-in.
Yes, the surfboard bothers me.
Yes,
your approach to this case bothers
me.
And yes, you bother me.
You
two have produced squat in the last
two weeks, during which time the Ex-
Presidents have robbed two more
banks!!
Do you have anything even
remotely interesting to tell me?
UTAH
Caught my first tube this morning.
Pappas signals, unseen by Harp, for Utah to shut the fuck
up.
CORRIDOR TO COMPUTER ROOM
Johnny and Angelo walking.
PAPPAS
What, you couldn't have just left
the thing in your car?
UTAH
It sticks out, so I can't lock it.
Look, Angelo, you think I joined the
FBI to learn to surf?
This was your
lame-o idea in the first place.
You
gotta back me up on this.
PAPPAS
Johnny, all I can say is we better
come up with something real soon.
Johnny cocks an eyebrow and opens the door to the computer
room ceremonially, like a doorman at the Ritz-Carlton.
Miss Deer looks up as they enter.
COMPUTER ROOM
TIGHT ON CRT as a lab report scrolls up the screen.
Gas
chromatography and spectroanalysis.
Columns of elements
and compounds, listed as percentage-of-sample.
MISS DEER (V.O.)
Encino Savings & Loan guard grabbed
LBJ's ponytail.
We recovered one
hair.
WIDER, showing Utah and Pappas over her shoulder at the
terminal.
PAPPAS
Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year.
Guy got his jaw broken for it.
MISS DEER
One four centimeter strand.
Color
brown.
Oily.
Slight wave.
PAPPAS
Hell, what're we waiting for, let's
go pick the guy up.
UTAH
Angelo, pay attention.
There's
gonna be a test afterward.
Lab is
showing traces of toxins.
PCBs.
Heavy elements... selenium, titanium
and arsenic.
PAPPAS
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
Utah is excited as he fits the pieces together for his
partner.
UTAH
The beaches are always being closed
because of waste spills, right?
And
surfers are territorial.
They stick
mostly to certain breaks.
If we can
get some hair samples, and get a
match to a certain beach, we'd know
which break the Ex-Presidents surf.
You buyin' this?
PAPPAS
No.
But let's do it, anyway.
It's
gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
CUT TO:
FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT
A long series of ENVELOPES are displayed on a desk.
Each
has the name of a Southern California beach and is
attached to a forensic printout.
HALSEY inspects each envelope.
HALSEY
Naw, this isn't it.
UTAH holds up an envelope with a skinny woven ponytail
sticking out.
PAPPAS shrugs.
PAPPAS
He moved.
Halsey picks up an envelope marked "Latigo Beach".
HALSEY
PCBs, selenium, titanium, arsenic.
The percentages look right.
Here's
a match.
UTAH
Latigo Beach.
Pappas grabs the envelope, studies it, crooks his head.
PAPPAS
Surf's up, ace.
CUT TO:
CAR - PCH - SANTA MONICA - DAY
Utah is struggling into a T-shirt as Pappas drives,
intently following a beat-to-shit JEEP.
Paramilitary
olive-drab and full of surfboards.
And razorhead.
PAPPAS
Ten seconds you're out of sight.
Unbelievable.
Johnny is equipment-juggling now... cradling a cellular
phone at his ear while steadying Pappas' binoculars in
front of his eyes.
UTAH
You're losin' them.
(into phone)
That's right.
Two-denver-four-sam-
niner-five-niner.
Late seventies
Jeep.
LONG LENS, JOHNNY'S POV through binoculars.
Bunker's jeep
weaves aggressively through traffic ahead.
Horns honk.
Tone flips off the driver of a Toyota.
PAPPAS
Look, if you're gonna go leavin'
your piece and your shield in the
car, you can damn well stay in
sight.
Okay?
UTAH
Okay, Dad.
CAR
Utah on the cellular, Pappas behind the wheel as they
slide to a stop half a block from the stucco house.
UTAH
... Felony B and E, three months in
juvey.
Better.
Felony assault.
Postgraduate work at Chino.
Excellent.
I'm lovin' it.
What
about the brother?
(Utah is grinning)
Great!
Another model citizen.
These guys really fit the profile.
PAPPAS
Remember, all bank robbers are
losers, but not all losers are bank
robbers.
LONG LENS POV of Razorheads house.
Through the windows we
see the four moving inside.
Tone throws Archbold and
Bunker a Coors from the fridge.
Archbold shakes his and
opens it in Warchild's face.
Warchild, in no mood, slams
him against the wall.
We feel the revved-up, chaotic
energy of the group in silent pantomime.
Bunker is met by a GIRL coming from the back of the house.
She is wearing only panties and a black leather vest.
Short black hair and tattoos stark on her white skin.
Bunker puts one arm around her neck in a head lock embrace
and slides his other hand under her vest.
Tone pulls the
curtains.
UTAH
These are the guys.
I can feel it.
I say we lay it on Harp.
CUT TO:
PAPPAS' CAR - NIGHT
Pappas pulls away from the curb, roaring past the other
agents sedan.
Utah and Cole flip each other off
perfunctorily as they pass.
UTAH
When did Harp say they'd have the
warrant?
PAPPAS
He's pushing it through first thing.
You better get some sleep tonight,
it could be an interesting morning.
CUT TO:
BODHI'S HOUSE
Tyler leads Utah through the steady flow of SURF-RATS and
other PCH NOMADS toward a large outdoor deck where a
barbecue is in progress.
Moonlit waves pound the shore
eighty feet below.
They are immediately distracted by the small crowd
gathering around GROMMET who has his nose pressed flat
against the center of a dart board.
His eyes swivels back to ROACH, standing fifteen feet
away, dart in hand, getting ready to throw.
GROMMET
Do your worst, man!
Roach drains a beer in one gulp, spies the sharp needle
point of the dart, then squints at the target.
ROSIE moves through the small crowd collecting bets.
Suddenly Roaches arm snaps back.
A collective hush...
In a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is
airborne.
TWAAAPPPPPP!
Bulls-eye.
Centimeters from flesh.
Grommet
secretly exhales.
Roach howls as Rosie rains money on his
head.
The crowd goes wild.
BODHI stands nearby with his arm around a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
Pleased to see Utah, he motions him over.
UTAH
Don't you gamble?
BODHI
Only make bets I can't afford to
lose.
Only way to be 100%
committed.
With that, Bodhi smiles, then he and the woman vanish into
the crowd.
Utah watches them go, turns to Tyler.
UTAH
Who's the girl?
TYLER
Catch of the day.
UTAH
Oh, oh.
That sounds personal.
TYLER
People are expendable to Bodhi.
UTAH
Meaning you were expendable.
TYLER
(shrugs)
We went out for about five
minutes... which is four minutes
longer than most of them.
But you
can't hold it against him, he's...
different.
UTAH
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
TYLER
(she chuckles)
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a
higher plane of existence, or
something.
(thoughtful)
Maybe he has.
You've seen him
surf... that frenzy.
It seems like
anger.
It's not.
It's the energy
of lovemaking.
The sea is the woman
in his life.
She's his only true
lover.
Utah studies her a moment.
He's caught the faintest hint
of regret in her voice.
But also the straight-ahead
pragmatism.
He looks down at the waves pounding
mercilessly against the rocks.
UTAH
All she does is beat the shit out of
me.
DISSOLVE TO:
PARTY - LATER
Lingering surf-rats stoned and drunk.
Nathaniel stands on the railing of the deck, Corona in
hand, gazing out at the black water.
He grins sloppily,
body wavering dangerously as he hunkers down into a
surfing stance.
NATHANIEL
(beer soaked speech)
... Okay, so you're in the face,
it's twenty-five feet straight down,
your balls are about this big.
(like he's holding up
two BB's)
And the whole thing's moving, right,
roaring like you're stuck to the
front of a freight train.
There
ain't nothin' like it, man.
The
ultimate rush.
Forget about sex, it
doesn't even come close.
ROACH
You lose it right then, you're
history.
The fish'll be pickin' you
outta the coral.
Nathaniel cackles that absurd Pee-Wee Herman laugh.
He
starts to flail, arms pinwheeling.
Utah catches him by the back of the shorts and pulls him
back.
Nathaniel spins and drops clumsily onto the deck.
NATHANIEL
(matter of factly)
Thanks, brah.
Tyler sits next to Johnny, sipping a beer.
Bodhi is not
in sight.
ROACH
See, it's all dynamic, it's all in
motion.
You can't just stop and
walk on in to the beach if you don't
like the way things are going, y'
know what I mean?
You gotta ride it
out man, all the way.
GROMMET
You ride the monsters, you gotta
know you're ridin' a line between
life and death.
There ain't no
forgiveness.
UTAH
So what's the biggest?
Waimea?
BODHI (V.O.)
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Bodhi glides into the group and sits, his expression dark
and enigmatic.
The beautiful girl kneels behind him,
massaging his neck.
He seems not to notice.
GROMMET
Shit, yeah!
I remember that day...
gnarly fuckin' ass!
Was your
birthday--
ROACH
The set was northwest.
Jacking up
like a fucking mountain of gray
glass--
BODHI
I made that one mistake you pray
you'll never make--
NATHANIEL
You shoulda fuckin' seen it... it
was like he fell for-ever.
Then the
curl crashes down and he's gooone--
GROMMET
-- held down in the washing machine,
man... it was severe, we couldn't
see nothin' thought it was all over
for sure--
Nathaniel HOWLS.
Tyler watches Utah watching Bodhi.
Notices how he is
mesmerized by these war stories.
Bodhi smiles,
unexpectedly.
BODHI
Not tragic to die doing what you
love.
You want the ultimate thrill,
you gotta be willing to pay the
ultimate price.
NATHANIEL
Fuckin' A.
GROMMET
(draining a Corona)
Hell, I ain't gonna see 30.
He and Nathaniel slap a warm, brotherly handshake.
Utah notices that Tyler is giving him a dark look.
She gets up suddenly and walks away from the group.
UTAH
(to the surfers,
covering)
Uh.
I need another beer.
He heads out after Tyler.
HALLWAY - DEN
Johnny moves through the house, looking for her.
As he
passes the den, he sees Tyler standing inside, and goes
into the dark room.
It is the only personalized space we have seen in the
house.
A kind of shrine to the Bodhisattva.
Shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels.
Maori masks, a blowgun, a skeletal shark mouth two feet
across, a huge fossil ammonite... an unbelievable variety
of tribal artifacts and marine specimens.
The books include political literature, eastern religion,
philosophy.
A strange hodgepodge of titles and authors:
Nietzsche, Marx, the Tao, "Steal this Book", "The Book of
Five Rings", Frederick Forsyth thrillers.
Tyler is looking at a wall of photographs and Johnny walks
up behind her.
Shots of Bodhi surfing a monster wave,
mountain-biking, skydiving, flying an ultralight airplane,
bungee-cord jumping, cliff diving.
Every kamikaze activity in the book.
TYLER
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.
I hope you're not buying into this
banzai-bullshit like the rest of
Bodhi's moonies.
UTAH
What are you talking about?
TYLER
I've seen that kamikaze look,
Johnny.
You've got it.
And Bodhi
can smell it a mile away.
He'll
take you to the edge... and past it.
(she looks past
Johnny, sees
something)
Hey, Bodhi.
Utah turns.
Bodhi is in the doorway.
BODHI
Johnny has his own demons, don't
you, Johnny?
Bodhi seems to stare into him.
Utah breaks the look.
Turns back to the photo gallery.
Bodhi's eyes swivel.
He ponders something.
Looks at
Tyler.
BODHI
Feel it?
Roach and some of the other surfers appear in the hallway,
wondering what happened to their leader.
He turns to
them.
BODHI
Gentlemen, it's time.
HOOT AND CHEERS.
Everyone bursts into motion.
Yelling
and running through the house.
UTAH
What's goin' on?
TYLER
Swell's here, Johnny.
Bodhi always
knows.
Bodhi returns from another room with... AN ALL-BLACK
SURFBOARD.
It gleams like obsidian.
Near the tip, in
small gray letters it says "Stealth Fighter".
Bodhi
thrusts it into Johnny's hands.
The others WHOOP maniacally.
Johnny feels the challenge.
The pull of the tribe.
BODHI
Let's go, Utah.
Time for a little
stealth mission.
CUT TO:
RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE
In the bedroom, Bunker looks through a slit of door at
Fiberglass.
We hear Pappas just outside.
PAPPAS (V.O.)
... and the guy next door said he
saw it go into your backyard.
My
wife'll kill me if I lose the little
bastard.
Me, I could care less.
Whole house smells from it's liftin'
its leg all the time...
Bunker looks like he's on paranoia overdrive.
BUNKER
Something's goin' down, man.
This
ain't right.
TONE
(freaked)
No, man, it's nothin'.
It's
nothin'.
BUNKER
Will you shut the fuck up!
Check
the windows.
Do it!!
HOUSE
Warchild slams into the wall next to Bunker.
WARCHILD
There's two guys by the back door.
Ducked down.
TONE
Oh, shit.
Shit!!
We're fucked,
man.
BUNKER
That fat fuck comes through the door
I'm gonna pump him up.
Swear to
Christ, man, I'm gonna blow the dude
up!
Scared and vicious, like a cornered dog.
We believe him.
Bunker jacks the bolt on the Steyr.
Warchild cocks the
shotgun.
HOUSE
Bunker's eyes bug out as he sees Pappas coming through the
door.
He snaps the assault rifle to his shoulder.
Suddenly Johnny is behind him -- half-in the bathroom
window, pistol gripped double-handed like they taught him
in Quantico.
UTAH
FBI!!
DROP IT!
Bunker whips around.
Squeezing off a wild burst!
B-B-B-
BLAM!
It rips the plaster next to Johnny's shoulder.
Shatters the shower door behind him.
The BLACK-HAIRED
GIRL screams.
Johnny flinches, FIRING RAPIDLY.
Wild.
Bunker drops, hit.
Warchild lets go with the 12 gauge.
KABOOM!
Takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by
Johnny's head.
Deafening in the confined space.
Johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe.
Tone just splits.
Down the hall like a greyhound.
PAPPAS is on one knee, his piece drawn fast, holding
Fiberglass in a neck-lock with one massive arm.
Bunker, wild-eyed and bleeding, is on his knees in the
bathroom doorway.
He raises the Steyr.
Mistake.
Angelo FIRES.
30 years in the field tends to show.
Three rounds.
Chest.
Chest.
Head.
Bunker is off the planet.
MUNOZ KICKS THE BACKDOOR IN like they do in the movies.
He and Cole charge into the rancid kitchen.
Badass FBI
agents.
JOHNNY, hotwired and hyperventilating, pops out for a shot
around the doorframe.
He gets a glimpse of Warchild's
back disappearing into the hallway.
FIRES.
His shot is
wasted, punching plaster.
Suddenly a pink freight-train hits him.
He forgot about the girl in the shower.
Naked except for her tattoos, she bodyslams him face-first
into the wall.
As he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and
hammers his head into the medicine-cabinet -- CRASH --
shattering the mirror.
Then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the
wall into her.
She drives her elbow into his back as he drops.
"FREIGHT TRAIN" lands knee-first on his gun hand, and
viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot.
It
skitters under the bed.
She's cut up from flying glass.
Demon-eyed and wired, her
body lithe and muscular under white skin.
She sprints
across the bedroom, leaving Utah slumped, heaving for
breath.
IN THE HALLWAY, Tone is hidden behind a doorway.
White-knuckling the forty-five.
A wild-eyed kid with a
big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it.
He hears footsteps POUNDING behind him and spins.
It's Warchild, running with the shot-gun.
WARCHILD
Move it, man.
Let's get the fuck
out of here!
Off-guard, Tone is SLAMMED BY THE DOOR as Munoz drives
into it with his shoulder.
Pounded between the door and wall, Tone is wired so tight
he pulls the trigger and blows a hole through his own
right foot.
He screams and drops to the floor.
Munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on
Warchild, who dives into a doorway.
Cole drives past Munoz, who has Tone pinned, and pounds
down the corridor.
Cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on
Warchild.
"Freight-train" appears behind him from another door.
She raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his
back up to the hilt.
Pulls them out, going for another stab, when--
Pappas spins her around and slams her face-first into the
wall.
UTAH, in the bedroom, sees Warchild blur across his field
of vision.
On pure instinct, he kicks into overdrive.
Johnny leaps
the bed and goes ballistic.
His flying tackle catches
Warchild at the window.
BATHROOM - BEDROOM - LATER
UTAH dry heaves over the sink.
Turns the faucet on full
blast and hoses his head.
He lifts a dripping face, wipes
water out of his eyes, stops on the reflection in the
mirror.
Pappas is there.
PAPPAS
It's always been lasers and paper
targets until today, right?
Utah looks up at him and nods.
He glances through the
doorway at Bunker, dead in a pool of blood.
Tone is
wailing as paramedics work on his foot.
Cole is being
taken out on a stretcher.
PAPPAS
No difference, Utah.
Just a little
more to clean up.
(squeezes the
rookie's
shoulder)
It's alright.
You did good today.
Across the bedroom AGENT BABBIT rips the back off a big
speaker unit.
Behind it, taped to the woofer, are two
large packets of a white substance.
PAPPAS
Oh shit.
Utah stares at the dope.
CUT TO:
POLICE HQ - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
TIGHT ON WARCHILD manacled to the chair screaming his head
off.
We cannot hear him through the glass.
It looks like
pantomime.
UTAH and PAPPAS watch through the one way observation
window.
THWAAAAAP!!
The two taped packets slam the wall inches
from Utah's right ear.
Johnny snaps his head around.
Stares into the face of DIETZ who looks like Warchild's
meaner brother.
And he's pissed as hell...
DIETZ
You know what this is?!
Two keys
uncut crystal meth!
UTAH
What the hell's your problem?
Dietz manically grabs a clump of his stringy hair.
DIETZ
You think I like this haircut?
My
wife wants me to stay at Ramada -- I
been working on these guys for THREE
MONTHS!
Finally -- finally--
(nodding to Warchild)
-- I get dickwad in there wantin' to
play wheel of fortune so I can find
out their supplier!
HARP emerges from the interrogation room, we hear a sliver
of Warchild's battle cry.
He spies Utah.
HARP
This is agent Dietz, DEA.
He's got
a record of your suspect's movements
every day for the last three months.
DIETZ
(stabbing the air
with the packets)
All I wanna know is how are these
guys supposed to be holding up
Tarzana City National on August 2nd,
when they are in Fort-fucking-
Lauderdale August 2ND!!!
HARP
Not an easy thing to do, is it,
Utah?
UTAH
Aw shit.
PAPPAS
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
We hear a faint BUZZ, growing louder as we...
CUT TO:
BEDROOM - UTAH'S APARTMENT - DAWN
The doorbell BUZZ shrieks through the room.
It stops.
Starts again.
A ghostly dawn finds UTAH and TYLER
sleeping peacefully, limbs entwined like vines.
Johnny's eyes snap open.
Spies the clock.
4:00 a.m.
Tyler stirs beside him, coming out of sleep.
Johnny wraps a blanket around his waist and staggers to
the door.
BODHI stands outside the door wearing a lunatic grin.
Behind him NATHANIEL, ROACH and GROMMET hoot from the
pickup.
BODHI
C'mon brah, there's a righteous
swell.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Tyler comes into the room, wrapped in a sheet.
Utah sees her knowing smile.
TYLER
He does this.
CUT TO:
HOUSE
Pappas dancing alone in the living room with his shirt
off, holding a glass of ouzo.
Facing away from the door
the ample Greek hears Utah's tentative knock.
Without
breaking from his dance or turning he calls out--
PAPPAS
Hey, babe.
Get on over here so the
big dog can teach ya how to bark.
Pappas howls like a bloodhound, then twirls around.
UTAH
Woof, woof.
We see the startled Pappas, at a loss for the first time.
PAPPAS
Johnny!
Uh, you, uh... should call
first, you know?
Hey, where the
hell were you all day?
You gotta at
least call in or something.
You
okay?
UTAH
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Pappas moves toward him, kind of subconsciously herding
Utah back out the door.
PAPPAS
Listen, uh... if you're okay, can it
wait till tomorrow morning, kid,
I...
Johnny hears footsteps and turns.
Miss Deer comes through the door like it's not the first
time, carrying a bag of groceries.
MISS DEER
Angie, they didn't have the kind of
wine you like but I got... oh, hi
Johnny!
Her icy office persona obviously got left there.
Her hair
is unbound and flows around her shoulders, and in halter
top and jeans she looks delectably off-duty.
Angelo looks at Utah like don't you say a fucking word.
CUT TO:
SEDAN
Pappas reaches across, starting the engine as Johnny jumps
in the driver's side.
Utah buries the throttle into the
firewall and charges aggressively through the medium
traffic.
Their sedan slews around the back of an eighteen wheeler,
fishtailing.
It straightens out.
No T-Bird in sight.
UTAH
The hell are they?!
PAPPAS
They took a left at the next light!
UTAH
You sure?!
Utah is totally wired.
Totally concentrated.
The
adrenalin is kicking in, flashing through his system.
His
brain is on turbo boost, reacting a thousand times a
second as they hit sixty through the traffic, which seems
to be standing still.
UTAH
I got 'em.
I see 'em.
I'm on it,
I'm on it.
High-speed slalom through cars and trucks.
The world passes by in a hysterical blur.
PAPPAS
You even watching the road?
A car pulls out, straight ahead.
Utah swerves wildly, mostly gets around him.
The guy's
bumper and front grille are removed.
Utah does a smoking
skid-recovery.
Doesn't even slow down.
The late model T-Bird is weaving manically.
It makes a
sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the
FBI agents.
Utah cuts the wheel into a huge Ralph's parking lot.
Pedestrians scatter.
Utah center-punches a week's supply
of groceries in a cart.
T-BIRD
The Presidents hold on desperately as Reagan white-
knuckles it through civilian traffic.
They're looking all
around, trying to see where Utah went.
LBJ
Where are they, man?
I don't see
'em.
We lose 'em?
Not exactly... THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see an airborne
Utah hurtling from a Ralph's entrance.
The sedan lands on
the street, tearing chunks out of the asphalt with the
undercarriage.
An instant later it hammers into the side of the T-Bird.
The two cars spin out of control.
Utah cuts the wheel,
slamming into them again.
Side by side demolition derby.
WHAM!!
Utah hits them again.
The Presidents lose
control, jumping a curb, losing the right front tire in
the process.
Utah's car starts to swap ends.
Hit the center island
broadside.
The sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass.
SCREECH of steel on concrete as it comes to rest.
Hanging upside down, Pappas is mightily pissed off.
PAPPAS
Nice fuckin' work, hotshot.
Christ!
They can see the T-Bird still moving.
It slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on
flapping rubber.
Johnny shimmies out of the wreckage, sliding on his back
in broken glass.
Pappas is packed in, upside down,
wriggling to get out through the side window.
A tight
fit.
T-BIRD
The Presidents are hammered up and down by the flailing
tire.
REAGAN
Emergency sanitization!
Here we go!
NEIGHBORHOOD - FOOTCHASE SEQUENCE
It becomes a blur.
Pure kinetic energy.
Two meteors
rocketing through a low-rent suburb.
And God help anyone
who gets in the way.
Reagan crosses a cluttered backyard.
Broken field run through toys, swing set, stacks of god-
knows-what.
He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of
spray.
Crashes through a hedge.
Through the narrow gap between houses.
Utah powers into the tight space behind him.
Blurring along between stucco walls.
They emerge into the front yard.
A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and
falls down.
Reagan and Utah both hurdle her.
AHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk.
Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two.
He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking
teenagers.
He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear.
Reagan flashes across the sunlit street.
Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the
brakes.
It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back.
The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the
truck.
Knocks him sprawling.
Utah doesn't stop.
Doesn't look back.
Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the
figure running ahead of him.
Like it's some kind of
hyperkinetic video game.
Everything is a blur.
Suburbia smeared into staccato
impressions.
The house across the street is blocked by fence on both
sides.
A MAN is picking up his mail.
Reagan pounds past him.
Right through the front door of
the house.
Utah follows.
Panting as he sprints down a dark hallway.
A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts
past her, knocking her flying.
Utah leaps over her sprawled legs.
Cats blur underfoot.
Utah crunches down on a tail.
A CAT
EXPLOSION.
Screeching merges with the woman's shrill
shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges.
Across the back yard.
Fence.
Over it.
Running on.
REAGAN looks back.
Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream.
He enters the next house.
Sliding glass door.
Utah sees Reagan pull it closed.
Locking it.
Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a
patio wall.
Heaves it ahead of him.
The glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS.
Utah blasts through a microsecond later.
Topples the kitchen table.
Furniture and crockery
crashing everywhere.
He sprints down a hallway after Reagan.
A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they
pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun.
WOMAN
Get the fuck out of this house!
What the fuck do you think you're
doing--
Around a corner.
A VICIOUS SNARLING SOUND.
Utah sees something flying at him.
Reflexively catches
it.
Reagan has thrown a PIT-BULL.
The Fierce Woman's fierce dog.
UTAH'S POV -- the snarling little demon right in his face.
He drop-kicks it like a goddamn field-goal right through a
doorway and runs on.
Another door.
Another explosion of sunlight.
Another
yard.
Sprinklers this time.
Reagan and Utah running through
sunlit walls of rain.
They crash through another hedge.
Emerging drenched.
The ground drops away.
Slipping and sliding on iceplant,
they skid down a steep slope.
Reagan reaches bottom.
A TEN FOOT RETAINING WALL, dropping off like a cliff to
pavement below.
Reagan falls, landing on his feet.
Panting now, feeling it, he stumbles up and runs on.
Utah rips down through the iceplant like a human
lawnmower.
Slides over the edge.
Falls -- lands hard.
TIGHT ON HIS KNEE and SLOW MOTION.
Taking the impact.
We HEAR something go.
Utah crashes to the pavement, his face contorted with
pain.
He grabs his tortured knee with both hands.
UTAH
Not now.
Not now!
Reagan runs on.
They are in an enclosed storage yard of
some kind.
Ten foot chainlink all around.
Utah struggles to get up and run.
He sprawls forward, biting back a howl of pain.
We see the incredible will driving him on.
He gets up and again, hobbling.
Trying to run.
Reagan reaches the fence.
He is heaving for breath.
Holding his side.
Utah stumbles, gets up, clutching his knee.
Hobbling forward.
His eyes wild, the veins in his neck
bulging.
Reagan starts to climb.
Utah collapses to his knees.
He
can't go on.
Reagan reaches the top of the fence.
He looks back.
UTAH HAS THE BERETTA POINTED RIGHT AT HIM.
Twenty feet away.
The muzzle rock-steady.
He can't miss.
They both are frozen, panting.
Locked into the moment.
REAGAN
You want me, there's only one way.
PAPPAS reaches the top of the hill, 200 feet away, panting
like he's about to collapse.
He sees the tableau.
ECU -- UTAH'S FINGER on the trigger.
Tightening.
RACK TO his eyes.
Blinking, water running into them.
God, he wants to.
ECU -- REAGAN'S EYES, through the mask.
Locked with
Utah's.
UTAH suddenly snaps his hand up and FIRES VERTICALLY.
HE HOWLS WITH RAGE, FRUSTRATION AND PAIN.
FIRES AGAIN.
And AGAIN.
Slumping back, his shoulders slam down onto the concrete.
Straight-arming the Beretta he FIRES RAPIDLY...
Bulleting the blue sky.
HIGH ANGLE, looking straight down on the tableau.
Reagan leaps off the fence and runs OUT OF FRAME, as Utah
empties the magazine straight at us, the shots merging
with his agonized howl, echoing as we--
CUT TO:
FBI BUILDING - BULLPEN - NIGHT
UTAH sits next to the DISPATCHER waiting for news like a
sailor in a storm.
His leg is popped up on a chair with
jeans split to the thigh and an ace bandage wrapped around
his knee.
His face is a nasty patchwork of scratches and bruises.
He drains his coffee and gazes out at the empty bullpen.
PAPPAS comes through the doors, wiping the remains of
dinner off his mouth.
PAPPAS
Nothing?
UTAH
Nothing.
The Dispatcher talks into his headset, glances up at
Pappas, shakes his head.
PAPPAS
Go home, kid.
Get the hell outta
here.
Get some sleep.
You look
like shit.
They get anything even
resembles your guy, I'm on your
beeper.
Here.
You like feta?
He smiles warmly, handing his younger partner a brown
paper sack.
UTAH
Feta.
My favorite.
Managing a weary smile.
Lifts his body out of the chair,
turns to go.
Angelo ponders something.
PAPPAS
Johnny...
Utah stops.
Looks back at the man.
PAPPAS
All I wanna know is one thing, why
didn't you just take the shot?
Johnny's gaze turns inward.
UTAH
I don't know.
CUT TO:
BATHROOM - UTAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
UTAH sits on the bathroom floor as Tyler dabs Betadyne
antiseptic over his wounds.
Utah cringes.
UTAH
Ouch.
TYLER
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
UTAH
You're kneeling on my hand.
She laughs, shifts her weight and keeps tending him.
TYLER
So what'd the other guy look like?
UTAH
Never saw him, was your basic hit
and run.
TYLER
But you look like you been in a
train wreck, how'd he just drive
away?
Utah acts like he wants to say something but his mouth
won't quite form the words.
Tyler dabs his face, touches
a finger to his forehead.
TYLER
Johnny, what is it with you?
You
have that look again, it's like
you're about to tell me something
and then you don't... or you can't.
What's going on?
Johnny searches her eyes.
She stares at him, becoming fragile suddenly.
TYLER
What?
What do you want to tell me?
Utah's brow unfurls.
The thought has passed.
He slowly
cups his hand over hers.
Gently pulling her close.
UTAH
I'm glad you pulled me out of the
water that day...
He presses his lips to the smooth curve of her forehead.
A kiss to each downcast eye.
Searching out her mouth with
his own as his hands glide down the small of her back.
Their reflection in the mirror as Utah slowly lowers Tyler
to the bathroom floor.
She clings tightly in a breathless
kiss.
BEDROOM - NIGHT
UTAH asleep, flopped in a spread-eagled X.
WE HEAR the bedroom door opening, see a slash of light
fall across the bed.
Johnny doesn't stir.
A shadow appears on the wall, moving toward him.
An outstretched arm holding a gun.
Utah snores softly, sleeping like a baby.
CAMERA TRACKS IN on his peaceful face.
A single eyelid flutters.
Total silence, until...
KABOOOOMMM!
The Pillow beside him EXPLODES into a
blizzard of goosedown.
Johnny rears up, eyes wide, mouth
agape.
TYLER stands above him, recovering from the kick of the
smoking 9mm Beretta in her hand.
TYLER
A lawyer!?
You lied to me!
She throws his FBI gold star at his face.
TYLER
Look, Tyler, I can--
BOOM!
Tyler SQUEEZES off another round.
Cascading goosefeathers falling like snow.
Utah flinches sideways.
TYLER
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been
using me!
Your jacket's on the
floor in the bathroom -- this
goddamn thing's half out of the
pocket... Oh God, it's all part of
some case, isn't it?
UTAH
Tyler, put the gun down.
TYLER
You tell me the fucking truth
Johnny... did your parents really
die in a car crash?
DID THEY?!
She waves the Beretta in his face.
UTAH
No.
They live in Columbus Ohio.
Tyler lowers the pistol slowly, the strength leaving her.
Her face begins to flood with tears.
UTAH
I work bank robbery.
Guys I'm after
are surfers.
I needed you, at
first, but not--
TYLER
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.
Fuck you!!
Don't you have a soul?
Goddamn you
to hell!
She goes limp as the sobs rack her body.
The gun flops
from her grip.
Utah sweeps it under the bed with his foot.
He moves to gently comfort her.
She bolts at his touch, running from the bedroom.
Utah is up and hopping into his pants to follow her.
He
stumbles.
UTAH
Tyler!
Wait!!
From the living room we hear a rattling of keys, the front
door opens and slams shut.
He hobbles to the door,
favoring his knee.
Opens it.
We hear the Porsche
screeching away.
Utah sags, the breath coming out of him long and slow.
CUT TO:
UTAH on the bed staring up at the ceiling.
Phone cradled,
listening to--
TYLER (V.O.)
Hi, it's me.
Leave a message.
BEEP!
He rests the telephone on his chest, letting the
tape roll a moment before he speaks.
UTAH
Tyler I... look, I fucked up, okay.
I know I fucked up.
I wanted to
tell you, but I couldn't -- I was
afraid you'd leave... good guess,
huh?
(grimacing)
Fuck, why can't I ever say what I
really mean?
I lied to you.
I'm an
asshole... but I need you, Tyler.
I
want you to know that I've never
known anyone like you before in my
life... and I... I hope you change
your mind...
He cradles the receiver, looks out the window.
Black of
night.
Dead still.
DISSOLVE TO:
UTAH asleep, telephone still perched on his bare chest.
BUZZZZZZ!
The rasp of the doorbell.
Johnny is airborne, phone flying across the floor.
Hunting for his pants, realizes they are already on, limps
in fast motion to the door.
UTAH
Tyler!
Wait, I--
Whips it open.
BODHI standing in the doorway, smiling like an excited
child.
BODHI
Howdy brah.
NATHANIEL, ROACH, and GROMMET are there behind him.
They look like sentry dogs.
Johnny freezes.
Bodhi walks past Utah, into the room.
BODHI
C'mon, get your gear on, we're
rollin'.
Cheerful, hardly able to contain his exuberance.
He moves through the room, grabbing Johnny's shirt from a
chair, a pair of sneakers on the floor.
Utah sees his FBI shield sitting on the dresser in plain
sight.
He palms it when Bodhi is turned away, and slips it into
his hip pocket to conceal it.
UTAH
What going on, Bodhi?
Bodhi plucks a couple socks off the couch, hands them to
Utah.
BODHI
Here.
(spying Johnny's cut
face)
Hey, what happened?
Ya cut
yourself shaving?
Johnny meets Bodhi's cold stare.
UTAH
I don't think I wanna surf right
now.
Bodhi's face takes on a crazy glow.
BODHI
Naw, this is different, Johnny.
This is something totally
different... you're gonna love this.
He winds an arm around Johnny's shoulders, guides him
toward the door.
BODHI
C'mon, let's go, let's go.
Time's
wastin', brah.
Bodhi claps Utah on the back, ushering him outside.
Nathaniel, Roach and Grommet fall into step beside them.
The door closes behind them.
CAMERA DRIFTS back through the apartment, coming to rest
on the 9mm Beretta, on the floor under the bed... useless.
CUT TO:
BODHI'S PICKUP
The tapedeck blasts.
BODHI and UTAH sit inside the cab.
Through the rear window, we see NATHANIEL, ROACH and
GROMMET in the flatbed.
Bodhi swivels his eyes to Johnny, lowers the volume.
BODHI
Life's sure got a sick sense of
humor, don't you think so Johnny?
Face splitting into a shit-eating grin.
UTAH
How you figure?
BODHI
(slight laugh)
News, last night... those guys, the
Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank
yesterday.
And I was just there the
day before, cashing a check.
See...
look.
Assured Trust... same place.
He takes a beat up checkbook off the dash and flips it to
Johnny.
Utah opens the cover and looks.
Sure enough.
Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
BODHI
I was picking up some bucks cause
we're leaving town.
Bizarre, huh?
If I'd waited a day I'd been right
in the middle of it.
Kinda sorry I
missed it.
I'd liked to've seen
them.
A long pregnant pause.
Utah breathes deeply, remaining
calm, his voice carrying a chilling bravado.
UTAH
Takes guts to rob a bank.
All that
adrenalin pumping, waving loaded
guns, taking out the guards, getting
everybody on the floor, never
knowin' who's gonna burst in...
(looks right at
Bodhi)
... wondering what it's like to take
a bullet.
Must be some ride.
Utah's smile is a personal challenge.
Bodhi sits
perversely intrigued.
The mental warfare escalates.
BODHI
Banks are insured, brah.
Long as
nobody gets shot, it's really a
victimless crime.
Just gotta scare
'em a little, would be my guess.
(ponders something)
Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with
all those guys wearin' body armor
these days, know what I'd carry?
Bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat.
He pulls out a huge holstered handgun, rests it in his
lap, draws and holds the gun up against his cheek.
BODHI
.454 Casull.
Most powerful handgun
on the planet.
Muzzle velocity of
2000 feet per second.
Twice the
kinetic energy of a .44 Magnum.
Bodhi stares at Utah, then flashes his signature smile.
Utah says coldly.
UTAH
One shot stopping.
BODHI
(laughs)
'One shot stopping'... good, very
good.
I like you, Johnny.
I like
you because you'll sacrifice
anything to win.
I respect that.
It elevates you a little above the
drones who have learned compromise.
Here, hold it.
Check out the
weight.
He twirls the gun, grabs the barrel and extends the handle
to Utah.
Johnny takes it slowly.
Now it's aimed at Bodhi.
BODHI
(cheerfully)
Whoa.
Careful.
You got the muzzle
pointing right at me, brah.
He casually pushes the barrel away, looking back at the
highway.
Johnny swings a stiff arm out his window and pumps a ROUND
into open desert.
KABOOOM!!
The recoil blows Johnny's
arm back over the top of the truck.
Practically breaks
his wrist.
Thunder rolls across the dark hills.
From the back of the pickup Nathaniel howls.
Grommet and Roach high five.
Johnny turns to Bodhi, breaking slowly into a feral grin.
UTAH
Nice.
He hands the smoking weapon back to him.
As if to say "two can play this game".
Bodhi stands challenged.
Each snared in the other's power...
Bodhi takes the weapon back, casually.
Slips it under the
seat.
BODHI
It's a special day, Johnny U.
A
very special day...
Utah's gaze travels beyond the windshield.
Where tentacles of brand new morning light vein the sky.
CUT TO:
CESSNA
Utah sits, wearing a day-glo jump suit, hugging the chute
in his lap.
Next to him is the gaping door.
Beyond... a
spectacular down sunburst at 10,000 feet.
ROAR of wind
and engines.
Utah watches Bodhi, Nathaniel, Grommet and Roach wriggling
into their colorful freefall suits.
Nathaniel pulls on a
pair of purple shorts over his suit.
Looks real dorky.
Grommet has on duck feet.
Bodhi, apparently, is going to
jump barefoot.
Nobody has their chutes on yet.
Johnny hefts his, as if weighing it, somehow judging the
contents.
His brain is racing.
Bodhi shouts over the
roar.
BODHI
It's a little ceremony we always
have at the end of summer.
One last
speedstar.
UTAH
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
BODHI
I did.
What's the matter?
Don't
trust me?
UTAH
You gotta earn trust.
BODHI
Then we'll earn it together.
Here,
take mine.
Bodhi swaps chutes with Johnny.
Utah looks at the new chute uncertainly.
Is this a game?
Poker moves?
Did Bodhi anticipate this step?
ROACH
Hey... you don't want Bodhi's, man.
His pack-jobs suck... they only open
half the time.
Take Grommet's, man.
Roach's grin is evil as he grabs Grommet's chute out of
his hands and switches it with Johnny's.
Keeps that one
and gives his to Grommet.
GROMMET
Whoa, unfair, dude!
Grommet grabs his chute back and hands Johnny the one he
had, which was Roach's.
I think.
Johnny looks at the pack in his hands.
Then at the
grinning faces.
Russian surfer freefall roulette.
Shit.
Bodhi studying him.
Some kind of test.
Fuck it.
Utah starts putting the damn thing on.
UTAH
We gonna jump or jerk off?
BODHI
My man!
VAN - DAY
The interior is empty except for several canvas duffel
bags and a small portable VCR.
It is one of the new sales
presentation models, with deck and monitor together in one
tiny unit.
UTAH
What's this?
BODHI
Insurance policy.
Now this is going
to sting a bit, but it's for your
own growth, brah.
Press play.
Utah hits the button and an image comes up on the tiny
screen.
TIGHT ON SCREEN.
A night shot.
Rosie the biker has Tyler
in a powerful grip.
Her hands are cuffed behind her, and
her mouth is taped.
He has his switchblade up to her
throat.
Her eyes are wild, but with rage, not fear.
She's trying to struggle out of his grip, kicking at him
viciously.
He controls her efficiently.
Bodhi stops the tape.
BODHI
She's a wild one, isn't she...
Special Agent Utah?
Utah lunges, pinning Bodhi to the wall of the van... an
elbow across his throat.
UTAH
You're a fucking dead man--
BODHI
(gasping for breath)
Whoa, whoa!!
Think it through!
I'm
the only one knows where they are.
Just let me talk for a second.
Johnny pulls back.
Barely in control.
UTAH
Talk.
BODHI
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do
anything.
At least not as long as I
meet him at a certain place and time,
about... let's see...
(he looks at his
dive Rolex)
... six hours from now.
Utah's voice sounds kind of strangled.
UTAH
You call him... right now... and
tell him to let her go.
BODHI
Sorry, can't do it, brah.
He's on
the road.
And where they're going
there's no phones.
Damn, I hate
this Johnny, I really do.
I hate
violence.
See, that's why I need
Rosie.
I could never make this
thing work, myself.
No way I could
hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man!
She was my woman, once.
We shared
time in this world.
But Rosie, he's
kind of a... mechanism.
Once you
set him in motion, he won't stop.
That's his gift, a kind of...
blankness.
Noon comes, straight up,
he'll gut her like a pig and try not
to get any on his shoes.
Nothing I
can do, unless I get there.
Utah blanches as he takes this in.
Knows Bodhi well
enough now to know he means business.
BODHI
So that makes us partners, doesn't
it?
Because now we both have the
same goal... to get me where I need
to go.
Right?
Utah's expression turns suddenly cold as an executioner's.
UTAH
We're wasting time.
BODHI
See!
That's what I like about you,
man!
You're just sharp as a razor
blade.
Bodhi jumps out of the van and approaches the others,
gathered nearby.
He addresses the pilot first...
BODHI
Get the plane down to Santa Monica
and top up the tanks.
(to the others)
Let's go.
Let's saddle up!
CUT TO:
VAN
EXTREME CLOSEUP ON the velcro straps of Second Chance
armor.
Tanned fingers cinch it tight.
A SHELL slides
into the cylinder of the Casull.
A SHOTGUN is cocked.
KACHACK!
BODHI
It's basic dog psychology, brah.
If
you scare them, get them pissing
down their leg, they submit... you
control them.
If you project
weakness, you draw aggression...
that's how people get hurt.
WIDER, revealing that Bodhi is in the back with Utah and
Roach.
Nathaniel and Grommet sit up front.
The duffels contents are strewn around.
Masks.
Weapons.
They're all pulling on suit pants and jackets.
Tying
ties.
Slipping on white gloves.
Snappy Oxfords.
Bodhi is pulling a suit jacket on over his BODY ARMOR.
Utah is fumbling with his armored vest.
He works with
vicious, jerky moves.
His jaw locked.
Eyes down.
BODHI
Fear causes hesitation, and
hesitation will cause your worst
fears to come true.
You project
strength to avoid conflict.
ROACH
Peace through superior firepower,
babe.
Bodhi conspicuously empties all the shells from a PUMP 12
GAUGE.
Pockets the shells.
Tosses the weapon to Utah.
BODHI
Here, you need this.
You can't be
comin' through that door with your
dick in your hands, right?
UTAH
I can't do this.
BODHI
Sure you can!
You may even like
it... it's a killer rush.
You'll
see.
Hey, don't I show you things,
Johnny U?
UTAH
Bodhi, this is your wake up call,
man -- I... am... an... Eff...
Bee... Eye... Agent!!
BODHI
Wild, ain't it?!
See, we exist on a
higher plane, you and I.
We make
our own rules.
Why be a servant of
the law Johnny U... when you can be
it's master?
GROMMET
Fuckin' A!
BODHI
Ninety seconds, man, door to door.
A small price to pay for someone who
loves you.
(he looks up)
She does you know.
It's not her
style to fall so hard... I don't
think she did with me.
He pulls the Ronald Reagan mask over his head smoothly.
Roach pulls his on.
NIXON.
Nathaniel becomes KENNEDY.
Grommet transforms into LBJ.
Bodhi looks in the bag -- no more masks.
BODHI
Sorry, Johnny.
Guess you don't get
to be president.
JOHNNY'S POV -- the back doors of the van.
And the
promise of what is beyond.
Bodhi enters FRAME.
Looks
straight at us.
BODHI
Rock and roll!
BOOM -- THE DOORS bang open, REVEALING--
BANK
THE HANDHELD POV CONTINUES as we follow Bodhi, a wolf
plunging among the sheep.
A FAT GUARD inside the doors.
He turns to us just as Bodhi butt-strokes him hard in the
gut.
Someone screams.
BODHI
Everybody freeze!!
Don't move!!
AHEAD of us GROMMET/LBJ covers the SECOND GUARD with his
12 gauge.
GROMMET
Don't fucking do it, man!
The guy has his hand on the grip of his pistol but it's
like the thing suddenly weighs eight tons, he can't seem
to lift it from the holster.
ROACH/NIXON slips up next to
him and helps him with it.
The guy is visibly trembling.
A YOUNG JOCK makes a move to run.
'OUR' SHOTGUN comes up like a reflex, right in his face.
Roach/Nixon throws the guy to the floor by his hair.
AHEAD OF US, Bodhi is in action.
Moving to the counter,
shouting--
BODHI/REAGAN
All Tellers back away from the
counter!
Hands on your heads!
RIGHT NOW!!
That's right.
You know
the drill.
It's like a replay of the robbery Utah saw on video.
But
he's right in the middle of it, like in some kind of
nightmare.
WE'RE STILL IN POV, the image WHIPPING wildly from side to
side as Utah scans the room.
We whirl dervish among the
statuary of the customers and bank employees.
Our gaze
drifts across THE FLOOR MANAGER, a short guy in a brown
suit standing with his hands clasped behind his back.
BODHI/REAGAN
All customers on the floor.
Let's
go!
Move it!
Get down!
On the
floor!
Right now!
Let's go.
Roach and Grommet are pushing them down.
Utah stands stiffly with the shotgun.
He seems dazed.
He catches the eye of a CUSTOMER.
In a tenth of a second
we see Johnny see the customer see his uncertainty.
Fear
has them both hyper-aware.
Johnny gestures fiercely with the shotgun.
UTAH
On the floor, asshole!
What's your
problem?!
I blow your fucking
kneecaps out, you'll be on the
floor!!
The guy hits the deck like a sack of cement.
BODHI/REAGAN floats beside Johnny, scanning with the
Casull.
He speaks without turning his head.
BODHI/REAGAN
Kick in the ass, ain't it?
Gonna be
kinda hard to explain though... when
they play the tapes back down at the
bureau.
Could look bad on your
monthly evaluation.
Johnny looks up at surveillance camera.
He's quite
fucked.
UTAH
Can we just get the goddamn money
and get out of here?!
BODHI/REAGAN
That's the spirit!!
(to the room)
Head's down!
Eyes down!
Just a
couple minutes of your life and
we're gone.
Bodhi leaps to the counter, commanding the room.
But at this point they diverge from their time-proven
plan.
Roach isn't going for the drawers... he's sprinting for
the VAULT.
BODHI/REAGAN
You!
(reading a name-tag)
Miss Jennings... of New Accounts.
Be a dear and open the inner gate
for my associate.
NOW!!
MISS JENNINGS
He -- he -- he has the keys.
Mr.
Duggan.
BODHI/REAGAN
Whatta say, Mr. Duggan?
Wanna give
her the keys or do I pick through
the blood and chunks for them?
DUGGAN, the bank manager, is surprisingly calm as he takes
the keys from his pocket.
Holds them out to the terrified
woman.
DUGGAN
Do whatever they say, Terry.
MISS JENNINGS hurries to comply.
She unlocks the STEEL CAGE inside the big vault door.
Roach/Nixon and Grommet/LBJ take her inside with them.
A CUSTOMER, lying on the floor near the fat guard catches
his eye.
The guard, face jammed against the linoleum, blanches as
he sees the customer lift a corner of his shirt to reveal
THE BUTT OF A PISTOL.
The customer mouths the words "I'm
a cop".
The guard is hyperventilating.
AT THE FRONT DOORS A WOMAN comes in out of the bright
sunlight.
JFK pulls her in fast and throws her to the floor.
Then
goes back to watching the street.
JOHNNY is next to Bodhi/Reagan.
UTAH
You're blowing it, man!
You're
breaking your own rules... pulling
too much time!
BODHI/REAGAN
JFK, how we doin'?
NATHANIEL/JFK
All clear, man!
INSIDE THE VAULT Grommet and Roach are pillaging rapidly.
Their hands blur as nice fat STACKS OF 20s and 100s are
dumped into canvas sacks.
ON THE MAIN FLOOR the OFF DUTY COP slips his hands slowly
around the butt of his pistol, concealing the move with
his body.
He signals with his eyes to the fat guard, glancing at the
guard's ankle.
TIGHT ON THE GUARD'S ANKLE where we can see a sliver of
BACK-UP GUN, a tiny .25 auto in an ankle holster.
The guard's eyes are pleading with the hard-on cop.
"Don't make me do this".
The guy is sweating, shaking.
A yellow liquid spreads
across the tiles next to his quivering hips.
He's
actually pissing himself, he's so scared.
TIGHT ON the off-duty cop.
Watching like a ferret.
He
cocks his .38.
ECU GUARD'S EYES, wide with terror.
It happens like lightning.
The cop pops to his knees,
straight-arming the .38.
The guard goes for his ankle
holster.
REAGAN spins.
The cop FIRES.
BLAM!
Reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the
impact.
He crashes onto a desk on his back.
Slides off,
scattering papers.
A teller screams.
The cop spins toward Utah.
Johnny throws down the shotgun.
Shows his palms.
He's
holding out his gold star.
UTAH
Federal agent!
Undercover!
The cop FIRES TWICE.
Two in the chest.
Utah is hurled
back.
Slams into the tellers' counter.
NATHANIEL/LBJ lets go with the 12 gauge.
BOOM!
The cop spins, hit by some 00 buck pellets.
The guard caps-off like a maniac.
BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
BLAM!!!
All of them wild, but serving to get Nathaniel pinned down
behind a check-writing island.
ROACH/NIXON LEAPS THE COUNTER and lands behind the guard.
The guard's shoulder explodes as Roach's 12 gauge
detonates.
He pitches onto his face, screaming and
holding the wreckage of his upper arm.
Grommet/LBJ is coming over the counter behind Roach as the
off-duty cop spins and fires.
BLAM!
BLAM!
Roach takes
it in the chest.
Staggers back, firing into the floor.
Trips and drops his shotgun.
Grommet clutches his throat as blood streams over his
fingers.
IN SLOW MOTION Reagan's face rises above the counter.
The mask is askew.
In order to see, Bodhi pulls it off.
The Casull comes up in a slow, deliberate arc as--
THE COP turns, terrified now, whipping his gun around,
nightmarishly slow as--
BODHI COCKS THE CASULL in dream-time and--
KABOOOOM!!!
The world's most powerful handgun proves its
claim at 2000 feet per second.
A gout of hamburger explodes out of the cop's chest.
He is lifted off his feet.
Hits and slides across the
floor leaving a two-foot wide red smear.
Echoes slap the walls.
Then all is still.
Plaintive
whimpering and moaning.
The air is blue with smoke.
Johnny is trying to catch his breath.
He rips his shirt
open to see two deep indentations in the Second Chance
vest.
Flattened .38 slugs caught in the Kevlar mesh.
But
no blood.
Bodhi drops over the counter near Utah.
The two men look at each other.
Bodhi's eyes seem lost.
He stares around at the carnage
he has wrought, the bloody wreckage of his ego game.
His expression changes to something new -- truly crazed
now.
We feel that the madness which has been held in
check so long has been let off its leash.
BODHI
Don't anybody fucking move!
Roach, clutching his side, moves to Grommet, who is on his
knees.
Beneath LBJ's stony countenance a river of blood flows
down Grommet's chest.
Roach pulls off the mask.
Revealing a terrified kid.
Grommet pulls his blood-drenched hand away from his
throat, stares at it bug-eyed.
GROMMET
Oh no, oh my god, oh god... it's all
comin' out man, gotta stop it...
it's all gonna come out... do
something!!
He's trying to hold it in with his hands.
This doesn't
work.
A paste-white frightened kid.
Eighteen years old.
Suddenly realizing that this is not some video game.
That
death is real.
He slumps back, losing the battle for consciousness.
WE HEAR SIRENS APPROACHING.
ROACH
(freaking to Bodhi)
We gotta bug out, man!
We're eatin'
it bad on this one.
Let's go!
Bodhi reaches down and picks up Johnny's FBI shield off
the floor.
He considers it for a long time.
Then looks up at Johnny.
His eyes seem to ask for forgiveness...
A moment before he smashes the Casull into Johnny's skull.
JOHNNY'S POV, as he drops to his knees.
Everything going
dark as we see Bodhi's face distantly, his mouth moving
slowly...
BODHI
Goodbye, Johnny.
The floor rushes up and smashes us in the face.
A view of shoes, running away from us, leaving bloody
footprints.
Then total darkness.
CUT TO:
FIRST SECURITY BANK - LATER
Ten minutes later the bank "crime scene" is in full swing.
UNIFORM COPS are everywhere, trying to get statements from
sobbing witnesses.
HARP, MUNOZ, COLE AND PAPPAS represent
the FBI contingent.
Cole has one arm strapped to his body
in a fairly elaborate sling, and he moves slowly.
Harp is barking orders to everyone in sight.
Outside
(visible beyond the doors) it's total pandemonium, with
cops and ambulances, and of course a huge crowd of
rubberneckers.
A MINICAM CREW shows up.
Harp starts
shouting at them.
COLE, with evident pleasure, cinches down a pair of
handcuff's on Utah's wrists with his good hand.
Johnny
has a deep cut on his forehead, and the blood is trickling
into his eyes, but he seems not to notice.
Not to hear
MUNOZ speaking monotonously--
MUNOZ
-- if you so desire, an attorney
will be provided for you free of
cost.
Do you understand these
rights I have explained to you?
Utah?
Pappas charges through the crowd, pushing Munoz aside.
PAPPAS
He knows his goddamn rights!
(looks at Utah)
Jesus, kid.
I knew you were getting
too close to these guys.
(turns to the other
agents)
Gimme the goddamn key to these
things, Cole.
Christ!
He gestures to the cuffs still cutting into Johnny's
wrists.
Cole hands him the key.
Harp storms toward them.
HARP
Don't take those off.
Just leave
them on!
Your partner's an
accessory to murder.
You realize
that?
Harp spins Johnny by the shoulder to look at--
Paramedics carrying the covered body of the off-duty cop.
Beyond, still on the floor, is Grommet, his eyes staring
in death.
He was right about not making thirty.
HARP
Three men dead.
One of them a cop.
How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
UTAH
(cold and scary)
Take your hand off my shoulder right
now.
Harp pulls back instinctively.
Utah's eyes burn into him.
Looks like Johnny's not in the FBI anymore.
PAPPAS
Look, Harp.
Don't turn him over to
the uniforms like some punk.
Let me
ride him in.
HARP
Yeah, sure.
Why not?
You two
screw-ups deserve each other.
That's why I put you together in the
first place.
Christ Pappas, you're
as bad as he is... talk about the
blind leading the blind--
Pappas steps close to the Supervising Agent.
PAPPAS
Harp, let me tell you something.
I
was an agent in this bureau when
your mommy was still wiping your
shinny pink ass, and you know one
thing I learned in all those years
that you still haven't?
HARP
What that?
Angelo steps in with a roundhouse that has all of his 280
pounds behind it.
Harp's head snaps back, and he flops in a heap.
PAPPAS
Respect your elders.
(he takes Utah by
the arm)
Let's go kid.
Harp struggles to sit up, rubbing his jaw, as Pappas
stuffs Utah into his car.
Harp is so shocked he doesn't
say a word.
CUT TO:
PAPPAS' CAR
They drive for a couple of blocks in silence, side by
side.
Utah in disgrace.
Contrite.
Stony.
Finally...
UTAH
I know where they're going.
PAPPAS
Figured you did.
Angelo flips Johnny the key.
Johnny lets himself out of the cuffs.
He sits rubbing his
wrists.
UTAH
Only problem is... we can't arrest
them or shoot them.
ON PAPPAS' "what the fuck?!" expression we--
CUT TO:
PLANE
The aircraft bucks like a bull as the pilot jinks and
banks wildly.
Bodhi has the Casull aimed at the base of his skull from
the jump seat just behind him.
Roach holds the shotgun on Utah, seated across from him in
the rear seats.
Roach is a pale, sweaty mask.
He is propped against a
bulkhead, seemingly collapsed in on himself like a
discarded coat.
His entire shirtfront and lap are slick with blood.
But his gaze is steady, and the shotgun is aimed into
Utah's guts.
No one talks or moves on this grim hell-ride.
PLANE
The pilot yells over his shoulder to Bodhi...
PILOT
Look, we been in Mexico the last
half hour... can I quit mowing the
lawn here or what?
I'm getting more
brush in the wheels than I usually
like, you know what I'm saying?!
BODHI
Yeah, get some height.
Take her up
to eight thousand on this heading.
The pilot pulls back on the yoke and the plane climbs.
Bodhi moves back next to Roach, who's fading.
ROACH
We're gonna pop up on their screens.
BODHI
Doesn't matter now.
We're almost
there, man.
Here, let me help you
get your gear on.
Bodhi drags a parachute pack up onto the seat next to
Roach and starts helping him into the harness.
Roach
keeps the shot gun pointed at Johnny.
ROACH
I'm cold.
BODHI
You're gonna be fine.
Just fine.
Johnny, toss me that money bag will
you.
Easy does it.
Utah hefts the duffel.
Weighs its contents, and their
price.
UTAH
You're cold because all the blood is
running out of your body, Roach.
You're going to be dead soon.
(he tosses the bag)
I hope it was worth it.
Roach clutches the canvas sack to his chest like a Teddy
bear.
Glares at Utah.
He hooks the strap of the duffel
over one shoulder.
BODHI
Hey, Johnny's just trying to psych
you man, forget it.
Just keep
thinking about all those senoritas
nursin' you back to health.
Come
on, amigo, let's get you set for the
jump.
Bodhi props Roach next to the open door and takes a
walkie-talkie from the seat, keying it.
BODHI
Rosie, Rosie, this is Air Force One,
do you copy, over?
A burst of static is followed by a surprisingly clear
voice.
ROSIE (V.O.)
Copy you, Air Force One.
We have a
visual on you.
Lookin' fine.
UTAH
Tell him to release Tyler.
BODHI
Why should I?
UTAH
What if your chute fails, Bodhi?
Rescind the order.
Let her off the
hook, she's served her purpose.
Do
it, man, you owe me that much.
Let
me hear it before you check out.
Bodhi meets his eyes and considers for a couple of
seconds, then keys the walkie.
BODHI
Rosie, listen carefully.
Surgery
is canceled, is that clear?
Repeat
it back to me.
ROSIE (V.O.)
Copy you.
Surgery is canceled.
I'm lettin' the bitch go.
Bodhi looks out the doorway.
Gauging distance, airspeed,
the geography below.
He looks at Utah, aiming the Casull
at him.
Johnny stares back at him like a pit viper.
BODHI
I know it's hard for you Johnny.
You want me so bad it's like acid in
your mouth.
But not his time.
(he braces Roach at
the door)
Let's go.
Bodhi signals the pilot and Utah feels the plane drop as
the engines are cut back to an idle.
Bodhi slaps Roach on
the shoulder and Roach slumps backward out of the plane.
Bodhi braces to jump, looking at Johnny for a last split-
second.
BODHI
You lose, campadre.
He chucks the Casull onto the seat beside the door and
bails.
Bodhi tumbles out into space.
It's over.
Utah's knuckles are white, gripping the seat.
There's a
dynamo, spinning out of control in his head.
He leaps up
in an explosion of rage and drives his fists into a
bulkhead.
Looks around like a rabid animal.
TWO SECONDS.
THREE SECONDS.
Then...
UTAH
FUCK IT!!!
Utah grabs the Casull off the seat and dives out of the
plane.
LIGHTHOUSE PUB - DAY
Dark.
Almost empty.
A snarling crocodile head is mounted
above a tapper of Guinness Stout.
A Koala bear with
plastic eyes holds a Foster's.
A BARTENDER with leathered
skin washes glasses.
At the bar, a single disheveled customer... human
driftwood.
GUST OF WIND blows open a shuttered window.
The bartender moves to close it.
BARTENDER
Gonna close early today, mate, 'fore
the bloody storm hits.
JOHNNY UTAH swivels toward CAMERA.
His tanned face is
barely recognizable, jaws hidden underneath a slight
beard, long bleach-out hair swept behind an ear.
His
muscular shoulders pop from a sleeveless football jersey.
The man seems deadly focused.
UTAH
Storm's already here... It's
bringing me the swell.
Johnny stares into his drink.
ANOTHER BLAST OF COLD as the front door opens.
Johnny turns at the sound.
TYLER takes a step inside.
Her hair is different, more
bleached out, frazzled from the sun.
Her eyes adjust to
the dark room.
TYLER
John, they're here.
Utah downs the drink and slides off his stool.
He has a
pronounced limps as he crosses to Tyler at the door.
They exit into daylight under an old wooden sign which
reads: LIGHTHOUSE PUB - BELL'S BEACH, AUSTRALIA
