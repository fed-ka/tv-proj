VIETNAM - DUSK
A swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army
of men over a Vietnamese hillside.
The SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection
of the jungle. Falling into coulmns, like strands of soldier ants,
seventy-five men, at combat readiness, assemble on the edge of a
sweltering wilderness.
It is dusk. The mood is lazy, soporific. Members of one platoon huddle
close to the ground smoking a joint.
JERRY
Strong stuff.
ROD
(to JACOB, a soldier
squatting several yards
away)
Hey, Professor, how many times can
you shit in an hour?
GEORGE
Don't bug 'im.
DOUG
Where are those gooks already?
FRANK
Some offensive. I don't even think
they're out there.
PAUL
Jesus, this grass is something else.
JACOB SINGER returns to the group, pulling up his pants.
ROD
Why even bother to pull 'em up?
FRANK
You jackin' off out there again, huh
Jake?
PAUL
Hey, get off his back.
ROD
It's called philosophizing, right
Professor?
JACOB gives them the finger.
JACOB
Up yours, you adolescent scum.
Laughter.
SERGEANT (V.O.)
Mount your bayonets.
FRANK
(frightened)
Oh shit!
PAUL
Goddam!
ROD
Gimme that joint!
JERRY
Hey, something's wrong.
GEORGE
What is it?
JERRY
My head.
GEORGE
It's nerves. Take another toke.
GEORGE reaches out, extending a joint. Suddenly he gasps and falls to
the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. The others stand back,
startled. JACOB grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his
chattering teeth.
ROD
What's going on?
Before anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head, screaming. He turns
frantically in all directions.
JERRY
Help me! Help me!
PAUL
What the hell ... ?
In seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking
into a terrific blur. He crashes into FRANK with the force of a truck.
FRANK slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. He
begins gasping and hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as
he gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The MEN
watch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond reason into all-
out panic.
Suddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet and, without
warning, attacks the MEN around him.
PAUL
God Almighty!
PAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the ground. JACOB
jumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into the tall grass. PAUL rushes
to his assistance.
JACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him. It is the
face of a madman.
PAUL
Good God! What's happening?
The sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting
behind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening
sky.
ROD
Behind you! Look out! This is it!
The MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet, leaving JACOB
alone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers
his strength.
JACOB
Don't leave me.
Dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them.
SOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision.
PAUL
They're coming!
Gunfire explodes on all sides. Suddenly PAUL flips out. He begins
screaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and skin. FRANK is
struggling like four men and JACOB is weakening in his effort to
restrain him. Bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire. Bodies fall.
More bodies keep coming. The first wave is upon them.
ROD shoots into the air. Shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like
banshees. ROD, squinting, jabs with his bayonet, piercing the belly of
his attacker. Agonizing cries accompany his fall. ROD yanks the bayonet
out and stabs again.
In the midst of this madness FRANK shoots to his feet and slams the
butt of his rifle into JACOB's back. There is a cracking sound. JACOB's
eyes freeze with pain. His hands rush for his spine. As he spins around
one of the ATTACKERS jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into
JACOB's stomach. JACOB screams. It is a loud and piercing wail.
CUT ON THE SOUND OF THE SCREAM to a sudden rush through a long dark
tunnel. There is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a
brilliant light. The rush suggests a passage between life and death,
but as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through
a SUBWAY STATION far below the city of NEW YORK.
WILMINGTON TOWERS - DAWN
JACOB walks toward the towering shadows of a massive PUBLIC HOUSING
PROJECT. It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic
structures. JACOB passes through a vast COURTYARD dominated by the
imposing shapes. Aside from his moving body everything is still.
VIETNAM - NIGHT
A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. JACOB is
crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE. His shirt is
bloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. His left
arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass.
JACOB
Help me. Someone.
Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It dances
around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It is impossible to
see who is carrying it. The light darts near the ground where JACOB is
lying and then bursts directly into his eyes.
NEW YORK CITY - DAY
JACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown
Manhattan. As he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of Al
Jolson's "Sonny Boy."
JACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th Street. He
opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him. He lifts
them with effort and slams the door with his foot. It doesn't close. He
considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy. He turns
instead and waddles toward the store.
VIETNAM - NIGHT
THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera yelling.
MAN
I found one. He's alive.
He shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos.
CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY
Suddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind his head.
JACOB
God almighty. What did you do to me?
LOUIS
I had to get in there. A deep
adjustment. Rest a moment and let it
set a bit.
JACOB
I had this weird flash just then.
LOUIS
What?
JACOB
I don't know. I've been having them
recently.
(he thinks a moment,
then changes the
subject)
You know, you look like an angel,
Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone
ever tell you that?
LOUIS
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No
more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back
won't take it. You tell your girl
friend to calm down if she knows
what's good for you.
JACOB
Louis, you're a life saver.
LOUIS
I know.
BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING
JACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to himself and
imitating Al Jolson.
JACOB
When there are gray skies, I don't
mind the gray skies, as long as
there's you ...
He hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The shop
windows have a particularly garish look about them. The mannequins are
dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic
appearance. A few shops have set up their Christmas decorations.
The ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous.
JACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug
store. They chortle and make taunting sounds.
GIRL
(shaking her tits,
singing)
"Hey, Mr. Postman ... "
JACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins to sing
with them. He knows the words. They like that. It is a sweet moment.
JACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The light is
green. He is still singing to himself and does not notice a BLACK CAR
sharging around the corner. The car is moving at full speed, heading
straight toward him. A YOUNG MAN walking a few steps behind yells out.
YOUNG MAN
Look out!
JACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but it swerves
in his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again.
YOUNG MAN
Jump!
With a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots
by. Two MEN are peering at him from the back seat. They are laughing
like madmen and shaking their heads. They do not look human. JACOB
yells and waves his fist, to no effect. After a moment he turns to
thank the YOUNG MAN whose scream had saved him, but he is gone.
VIETNAM - NIGHT
Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a
bright moon that is emerging from behind a cloud. The faces are looking
down and voices are speaking.
VOICE
He's burning up.
VOICE
Total delirium.
VOICE
That's some gash. His guts keep
spilling out.
VOICE
Push 'em back.
JACOB (V.O.)
Help me!
His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emenate from it filling the
sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw us forward with a
quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed. The rush
causes them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost
sensual, surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling.
Music can be heard in the distance, growing hard and insistent, like a
heart beat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The stroboscopic
flashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light. The
music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo. Then silence.
VIETNAM - PRE DAWN
WE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image of trees
materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise,
can be seen through the branches. It is an idyllic setting.
Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic
humming, growing louder. There is a scramble of feet and a sound of
heavy boots moving through the tall grass. Voices can be heard. Men's
voices.
VOICE
They're here.
VOICE
Thank God. Move 'em out!
VOICES
Bust your balls!
VOICE
Move it! Move it!
There is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches blur and
speed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself
as a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out of a JUNGLE covering and into a
huge CLEARING.
High overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a deafening
whine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air. SOLDIERS
leap up into the air reaching for them. The air is filled with
turbulence. Tarps fly off dead bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices
yell but the words are not clear. They are filled with urgency.
The CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear as the
helicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows larger and darker as
the CAMERA approaches. Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come
into view. Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control.
Hands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it.
Watery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a
heart beating. Gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds,
warm and familiar.
BAR - DAY
The TWO MEN leave the bar on a dingy side street. It is cold outside.
Christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bar's front window.
PAUL looks at them and smiles.
PAUL
Merry Christmas.
PAUL steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of his car.
He pulls out his keys and opens the door. JACOB looks down on the
sidewalk and notices a dime.
JACOB
Goddamn, this is my lucky day.
He bends down to pick it up. PAUL inserts the key into the ignition and
steps on the gas. He turns the key.
THE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air. JACOB
sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him. He covers
his head.
VIETNAM
CUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is exploding
all around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently.
JACOB's eyes peer to the left.
INFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A pair of
MEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a
stream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield. The
PILOT, unable to see, clears it away with his hands.
JACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the MEDICS presses
his ear close to JACOB to hear.
JACOB
Help me!
MEDIC
We're doing the best we can.
JACOB
Get me out of here!
BAR - DAY
THE YOUNG MAN from the bar grabs JACOB under the arms and drags him
down the sidewalk.
YOUNG MAN
Just hold on.
JACOB
Where am I? Who are you?
The YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another explosion
consumes the car. The air is filled with flames and flying debris. The
YOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar.
YOUNG MAN
Just lie still. You're okay. You're
not hurt.
The CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has blown
apart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross from around PAUL's
neck is buried in the debris. Sirens are heard in the distance. A BLACK
CAR speeds off down the street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had
helped him. He is gone.
FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY
A FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway.
CEMETERY - DAY
The FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along the length
of the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from their cars along with
WIVES and GIRLFRIENDS.
They are the SOLDIERS we have seen at the opening of the film, only
they are older now. A small group of FAMILY MEMBERS are helped to the
graveside.
JACOB joins the other VETERANS as pallbearers. They carry the casket in
semi-military formation to the grave.
A BACK ALLEY - DAY
The SIX MEN are walking quietly through an unpaved alley. It is already
gray and getting darker.
DOUG
I know what Paul was talking about. I
don't know how to say this ... but in
a way it's a relief knowing that
someone else saw them, too.
ROD
You're seeing ... ?
DOUG
They're not human, I'll tell you
that. A car tried to run over me the
other day. It was aiming straight for
me. I saw their faces. They weren't
from Brooklyn.
ROD
What are you tellin' me? They're from
the Bronx?
DOUG
It was no joke, Rod.
JERRY
Something weird is going on here.
What is it about us? Even in Nam it
was always weird. Are we all crazy or
something?
DOUG
Yeah, ever since that ...
He hesitates. They all understand.
ROD
What's that have to do with anything?
FRANK
It was bad grass. That's all it was.
JERRY
Grass never did that to me.
DOUG
You know, I've been to three shrinks
and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates
that night. Nothing.
ROD
It's not worth goin' over again and
again. Whatever happened, happened.
It's over.
JACOB
... I've seen them, too.
ROD
Shit!
JERRY
So have I.
JACOB
Look, there's something fucking
strange going on here. You know
Paul's not the only one who's died.
You remember Dr. Carlson over at
Bellevue? His car blew up, too.
ROD
Dr. Carlson's dead?
JACOB
An explosion, just like Paul's.
JERRY
No!
FRANK
Jesus!
GEORGE
You think they're connected?
JACOB
(he nods)
I think something's fucking connect-
ed. I mean, a car tried to run me
over the other day. Doug too, right?
We've got six guys here going fucking
crazy.
ROD
Not me, buddy.
JACOB
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us
are flipping out for some goddamn
reason. They're tryin' to kill us.
Fuck it man, we need to find out
what's going on.
DOUG
Do you think it has something to do
with ... the offensive?
JACOB
It's got something to do with some-
thing. I think we've got to confront
the army. If they're hiding shit from
us, we better find out what it is.
ROD
Come on, Professor. The army's not
gonna give you any answers. You'll be
buttin' your head against a stone
wall.
JACOB
Maybe that's the only way to get
through. Besides, six heads'll be
better than one.
ROD
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm
gettin' a headache just listenin' to
you.
JACOB
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
ROD
I say you should get a shrink.
DOUG
Too late. I've tried. I think you're
right, Jake. I'm game.
JERRY
Me, too.
ROD
You guys are fucking paranoid. It was
bad grass. That's all it was. There's
no such thing as demons.
OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
JACOB and the others exit the OFFICE BUILDING. They are jubilant,
clasping hands and smacking each other on the back. We watch as they
break up. JACOB heads for the subway. FRANK and another group hop a
cab. As the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind
it. It follows them out of sight.
BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - DAY
GABE, on a BICYCLE, is rushing down the sidewalk. JACOB is running
alongside him, holding onto the seat. Plastic streamers trail from the
handlebars. GABE is a bit wobbly, but determined. After a couple of
false starts, JACOB lets go and GABE is riding by himself. For an
instant, GABE looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face.
JACOB is grinning, too. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON GABE as he pulls away from
us and heads into the distance.
CUT BACK TO:
BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON
JACOB grabs his back. He is in excruciating pain. He tries to get up,
but can't move. He reaches out to people passing by, but they ignore
him and hurry past.
A SALVATION ARMY SANTA has been watching the entire scene. After a
moment's consideration he leaves his post and ambles over to JACOB. He
leans down and steals his wallet.
SANTA
Merry Christmas.
BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING
CUT TO THE SOUND OF A SIREN as an AMBULANCE races through the streets.
VIETNAM - NIGHT
CUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence
of the film. SOLDIERS with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in
the dark of the night. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS charges at JACOB with a long
bayonet blade and jams it into his intestines. JACOB cries out.
U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
CUT TO A SDIREN BLARING and a fire engine racing through the streets of
lower MANHATTAN. A CROWD is forming. Banks of lights and television
cameras amass in the cold night air. Police cars and mobile units rush
to the scene.
CUT TO JACOB. In one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch. In the
other he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps
of the U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS. The volatile liquid splashes
against his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement. A five gallon
container lies emptying nearby. Gasoline belches from it insistently
and pours onto the street. Bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes
toward them.
Television cameras and microphones are pointing in JACOB's direction,
but at a safe distance. He is yelling at them, his teeth chattering
from the cold.
JACOB
Listen to me. There were four
companies in our batallion. Five
hundred men. Seven of us were left
when it was over. Seven! Four
companies engaged in an enemy
offensive that not one of us who
survived can remember fighting.
BYSTANDERS
Use the torch!
ONLOOKER
Shut up! Let him talk!
POLICE AMBULANCES are arriving at the scene. FIREMEN ready hoses at
nearby hydrants. T.V. CAMERAS are rolling.
JACOB
(shouting)
You don't forget a battle where 500
men were killed. They did something
to us. I want to know the truth, the
goddamn truth. We have a right to
know.
(he yells toward the
cameras)
Are you getting all this? I want this
on national T.V. I want the whole
country, the whole world to know.
He holds up the torch. A loudspeaker blares through the crowd.
VOICE
Throw that torch away, young man.
Give yourself up. You're under
arrest.
JACOB
For what? For seeking the truth?
VOICE
Please come quietly.
JACOB
You come near me and I'll blow us all
up.
VOICE
We're not going to hurt you.
ONLOOKER
Give him a chance to talk!
JACOB
The army will deny it. They've
falsified my records. They've lied to
my lawyer, threatened my buddies. But
they can't threaten me.
BYSTANDER
You tell 'em!
BYSTANDER
Use the torch!
VOICE
Okay, let's clear the area. Everyone
out.
Suddenly a lighted match flies in JACOB's direction. JACOB is enraged.
He brandishes the torch at the crowd.
JACOB
What the fuck do you think you're
doing?
Another match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air. PEOPLE on the
fringe of the crowd begin to run. JACOB does not move.
VOICE
Clear the area. This is an order!
JACOB
What is wrong with you?
We hear laughter from PEOPLE in the crowd. As JACOB looks out into some
of their eyes he sees demons looking back. One of them throws another
match. Crazed, JACOB runs toward them. PEOPLE jump back.
Suddenly JACOB freezes. Standing on the sidelines, he sees one of the
ARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car. He is reaching for a gun.
JACOB, stunned, yells at the top of hhis lungs.
JACOB
NO!
With a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the air. We
see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher. All eyes
stare upward watching it in a kind of wonder. Then, reaching its apex,
just below the camera, it begins its descent. The eyes of the crowd
turn to fear. SOMEONE yells.
ONLOOKER
He'll burn us all!
Screams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the potential
conflagration. Only JACOB remains motionless, standing silently, almost
heroically, in the middle of it all.
Suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with
a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions. PEOPLE
panic. T.V. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN run for their lives. The ARMY
OFFICIALS run, too. The flames travel toward the Army Headquarters and
rush along the curb. Water hoses are trying to douse them as they
spread. JACOB, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through
the frightened crowds, as if in a daze. Viewed through the flames the
scene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell.
WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
JACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN in black
leather jackets are crusing the area and look at JACOB with curiosity.
One MAN in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him.
MICHAEL
Jacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman.
Friends call me Mike.
JACOB is startled when he sees him. He is the same YOUNG MAN who has
appeared throughout the film, assisting JACOB in moments of crisis.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know
me. I've been tracking you for a long
time. I just wish I'd spoken to you
before tonight.
JACOB
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have
you been following me?
MICHAEL
Observation, mainly. Clinical study.
You were one of the survivors.
A POLICE CAR passes them on the street. MICHAEL grabs JACOB's shoulder
and turns him away nervously.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Come on, we're not safe around here.
HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT
JACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER that juts
into the Hudson River. JACOB is wide-eyed as he listens to MICHAEL's
story.
MICHAEL
So first I'm arrested, right? Best
LSD I ever made, right down the
drain. I figure this is it, twenty
years in the joint, if I'm lucky.
That was '68.
JACOB
Long time ago.
MICHAEL
(nodding his head)
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers
Island. Ever been there?
(JACOB shakes his head)
Suddenly they take me from my cell to
the visitors room with those bank
teller windows, you know. Four army
colonels, medals up their asses, are
standing on the other side. They tell
me if I'll come to Vietnam for two
years, no action, mind you, just work
in a lab, they'll drop all the
charges and wipe the record clean.
Well, I'd only been in jail for
thirteen hours and I already knew
that Nam couldn't be any worse.
JACOB
Shows how much you knew.
MICHAEL
No shit. They had me by the balls.
Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ...
in a secret lab synthesizing mind-
altering drugs. Not the street stuff
mind you. They had us isolating
special properties. The dark side,
you know? They wanted a drug that
increased aggressive tendencies.
JACOB
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
MICHAEL
Right. They were worried. They
figured you guys were too soft. They
wanted something to stir you up, tap
into your anger, you know? And we did
it. The most powerful thing I ever
saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my
share, never compared to the fury of
the Ladder.
JACOB
The Ladder?
MICHAEL
That's what they called it. A fast
trip right down the ladder.
(he makes a downward
dive with his hand)
Right to the primal fear, the base
anger. I'm tellin' you, it was
powerful stuff. But I don't need to
tell you. You know.
JACOB can barely catch his breath, the information he is receiving is
so powerful to his mind.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
We did experiments on jungle monkeys.
They bashed each other's heads in,
gouged out their eyes, chewed off
their tails. The brass loved it. Then
they made us try it on Charlie.
(he pauses)
They took these POW's, just kids
really, and put 'em in a courtyard.
We fed 'em huge doses of the stuff.
(he stops for a moment;
a tear rolls down his
cheek)
They were worse than the monkeys. I
never knew men could do such things.
The whole thing still blows me away.
MICHAEL stands up and begins walking in circles around the PIER. JACOB,
astounded, gets up and walks beside him.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Anyway, this big offensive was coming
up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine,
Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was
scared 'cause they knew we couldn't
win. Morale was down. It was gettin'
ugly in the States. Hell, you
remember.
JACOB
Like it was yesterday.
MICHAEL
A couple days later they decided to
use the Ladder, on one test
battalion. Yours. Just in an
infintessimal dose in the food
supply, to prove its effectiveness in
the field. They were sure your unit
would have the highest kill ratio in
the whole goddamn offensive. And you
did, too. But not the way they
tnought.
JACOB is beginning to shake. MICHAEL pulls a container of pills out of
his jacket pocket.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Hey, want something to calm you down?
Made 'em myself.
JACOB shakes his head no.
JACOB
None of us can remember that night. I
get flashes of it but they don't make
sense. We saw shrinks for years. But
nothing they did could ever touch it.
What happened? Was there ever an
offensive?
MICHAEL
A couple of days later. It was
fierce. You guys never saw it.
JACOB
But there was an attack. I can still
see them coming. There was a fight,
wasn't there?
MICHAEL
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
JACOB
Who then?
He hesitates, obviously uncomfortable. His eyes grow puffy. He looks at
the river for a moment and then turns to JACOB.
MICHAEL
You killed each other.
JACOB's mouth drops open. The words hit him like a truck.
VIETNAM - NIGHT
Gunfire explodes in the darkening sky. We are in Vietnam. JACOB is at
the bottom of a trench fighting with FRANK. Chaos surrounds them. Men
are screaming. The ENEMY is storming at them from the rear. ROD raises
his bayonet and jams it into the belly of his ATTACKER. It is only
after a series of jabs that he sees it's another American he's killed.
ROD's eyes go blank with confusion and terror.
ROD
Oh my God! WHAT'S HAPPENING?
JACOB looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of AMERICAN
SOLDIERS bearing down on them. FRANK jumps up, knocking JACOB to the
ground and slamming his rifle into JACOB's back. As he spins around
JACOB sees another SOLDIER charging at him. His bayonet is aimed at
JACOB's stomach. For the first time JACOB remembers the face of his
attacker. He is a YOUNG MAN, about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing
glasses. The two men stare at each other in terrible confusion. It
seems like a moment out of time. And then the SOLDIER lurches forward
and rams his bayonet deep into JACOB's abdomen.
CUT TO MICHAEL BACK ON THE PIER. JACOB is ashen-faced.
MICHAEL
It was brother against brother. No
discrimination. You tore each other
to pieces. I knew it would happen. I
warned them. I WARNED THEM. But I was
just a hippie chemist, right? Jesus!
And I helped 'em make the stuff ... I
talked to the guys who bagged the
bodies. They're in worse shape than
you, believe me. They saw what was
left. It's a blessing you don't
remember. Of course the brass covered
the whole thing up right away. Blamed
it all on a surprise attack.
he pauses)
I needed to find you. The Ladder was
my baby.
Tears start flowing down MICHAEL's face. He wipes them with his sleeve.
It takes him a moment to regain his composure. JACOB is shivering.
MICHAEL takes off his jacket, drapes it over JACOB, and leads him to
the wooden planks overhanging the water. They sit and gaze at the
JERSEY SHORE.
CUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF MICHAEL AND JACOB in pre-dawn light.
MICHAEL
I always suspected the effects might
come back. That's why I had to follow
you. I had a hell of a time getting
hold of your records.
JACOB
If you knew, why didn't you say
anything?
MICHAEL
The truth can kill, my friend. Five
hundred men died out there. This
isn't a story they'd ever want out.
When Paul's car blew up I realized
the scope of the thing. I knew they
meant business.
JACOB
So why tell me now?
MICHAEL
Because I can get rid of the demons.
I can block the Ladder. I have an
antidote. We can kill them off,
chemically speaking. They'll all
disappear. It's chemistry, my friend.
I know. I created it. Come with me. I
can help.
GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY
JACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE.
It is early MORNING and the sidewalks are bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB
stares into their faces and beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys
JACOB's happiness.
WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY
JACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.
JACOB
It was paradise, Michael. You showed
it to me. You were there.
MICHAEL
Well that's good to know.
JACOB
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
MICHAEL
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed
you enough of that stuff to send a
horse to heaven. I'm just glad you
came back.
JACOB
I would have stayed there if I could.
MICHAEL
I'm sure. You've got nothing but
troubles waitin' for you here.
He points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE.
MICHAEL
(taking JACOB's arm)
Come on.
GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL - DAY
The TWO MEN head up to GRAMERCY PARK and stop in front of the GRAMERCY
PARK HOTEL. Reaching into his wallet, MICHAEL pulls out a huge stack of
credit cards and hands one to JACOB.
MICHAEL
Here. I've got every credit card ever
printed. Take this. Stay here till
you can arrange to get away. It's on
me.
JACOB
No. I couldn't.
MICHAEL
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be
foolish. Here. Take this, too.
(he pulls out a business
card)
This is my place on Prince Street.
It's got my phone, everything. Call
if you need me ... but you won't.
Everything's gonna work out. You just
get outta town as fast as you can.
The New York police can be effective
when they want to be.
JACOB
I don't know what to say.
MICHAEL
Save the words ... Just send back my
credit card.
MICHAEL laughs, hugs JACOB, and walks away.
SOHO STREETS - NIGHT
JACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast
as his legs will move. With unexpected violence he charges into the
side of a building. Over and over he hurls himself against it. He grabs
for the bricks. His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is
as though he is trying to merge with the wall.
Suddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is speeding
toward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark
night. JACOB steps into its path. It is hard to tell if he is trying to
stop the cab or waiting to be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB
stares at it a moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to
pull off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside.
SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
JACOB gets out of the TAXI and approaches the LOBBY of SARAH'S
APARTMENT BUILDING. JACOB is greeted by the DOORMAN.
DOORMAN
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
JACOB
(greeting him warmly)
Hello, Sam.
DOORMAN
(noticing JACOB's
battered condition)
Are you all right?
JACOB
I'm okay.
DOORMAN
Do you want some help? I can call
upstairs.
JACOB
No, don't. But thanks.
CITY COLLEGE - DAY
JACOB AND PROFESSOR STERN walk down the city streets that
constitute the CAMPUS of CITY COLLEGE.
STERN
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
JACOB
(shrugging his shoul-
ders)
I haven't seen her in months.
STERN
(understanding)
Ah!
JACOB
I'm with another woman now. We're
both with the post office, Midtown,
34th Street branch.
STERN
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too
many philosophers in the post office?
JACOB
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't
have their doctorates, that's all.
STERN
(he smiles)
Last I heard you were offered a posi-
tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon
was it?
JACOB
Oh, that goes way back. They had a
hiring freeze, one of those last min-
ute things. Bad timing for me though.
Middle of the war. The draft.
(STERN nods his head.
They walk a moment in
silence)
I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam
... I didn't want to think anymore. I
decided my brain was just too small
an organ to comprehend this chaos.
STERN
(looking at JACOB with
affection)
Jacob, if it was any other brain but
yours, I might agree.
(he pauses)
Tell me, does your lady friend know
what a brilliant thinker, what a sub-
lime intellect she's living with?
JACOB
(smiling coyly)
I doubt it's my mind that interests
her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery
lady.
STERN
(with a fatherly
demeanor)
Well, try not to get burned. You have
a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone
tempt you away from it.
VIETNAM - NIGHT
Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness,
outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large
cloud. The faces are looking down and voices are speaking.
VOICE
He's burning up.
VOICE
Total delirium.
VOICE
He'll never make it.
VOICE
That's some gash. His guts keep
spilling out.
VOICE
Push 'em back.
JACOB (V.O.)
(crying weakly)
Help me!
His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emanate from it
filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw
us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into
exhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash
stroboscopically and produce a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of
color. The display is spectacular and compelling. A voice can be
heard in the distance.
VOICE
I think we're losing him.
Suddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image, a
kind of CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, rising up into infinite dimensions.
As we speed toward it, it grows increasingly majestic. The image
is so awesome and other-worldly that it is difficult to grasp
what is being seen.
Music can be heard in the distance. It too is celestial in its
beauty. Then, unexpectedly, it grows hard and insistent, like a
heartbeat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The image of
the STAIRCASE shatters and disappears, replaced by intense
flashes of red and blue light. The music grows louder and reaches
a thundering crescendo. Then silence.
