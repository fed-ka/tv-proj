The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for
their shows. Cabs line the streets.
SIDE ALLEY
A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a
screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and
rushes to the side entrance of a theater.
In the background we see that the title of the play,
"Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee...

Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street
toward a large circular theater.
He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater--

About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They
are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard.
POLE
Break it down!
And several of the guards charge the door with their
pikes, HITTING it hard.
POLE (CONT'D)
Again!

--the guards SMASH the door open.
Pole is the first
in.
POLE
Jonson!
Jonson!!
Show yourself!
The soldiers immediately spread out into different
parts of the theater. Jonson's gone. Because--
JONSON
has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat
trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of
props and costumes (swords, masks, flags and banners,
shields, barrels, canons, etc.) But Jonson freezes
when he sees--

pg. 5
THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE STAGE'S FLOORBOARDS
--the soldiers jump onto the stage and spread out, Pole
amongst them.
POLE (CONT'D)
Out with you! Jonson! We'll smoke
you out like a rat if we have to!
(beat)
Jonson?! Jonson!!
Nothing.
A beat, then--
POLE (CONT'D)
(to a soldier)
Torch it.
The soldier hesitates.
POLE (CONT'D)
Torch it!
All of you!
The soldiers obey, lighting fire to the walls, the
galleries, the columns as--
JONSON
GASPS in horror. Desperate-- he spies an open metal
box nearby filled with un-used fireworks.
He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then
places the bound manuscripts in their place, then
closes the box. Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--
FLAMES
--begin to take hold everywhere: the columns at the
front of the stage... the trompe-l'oeil walls... the
seating galleries... the columns...
A TRAP DOOR
opens center-stage, and Jonson JUMPS out, the rapier in
his right hand, ready for a fight. But-- three
soldiers jump onto the stage, pikes ready.
Jonson-- no fool- turns and runs for the other end of
the stage-- but then runs smack into four other
soldiers!
Ballocks!
Jonson turns this way and that-- nowhere to run-- grins
wryly, drops his sword. Raises his hands in surrender.

Jonson, his hands tied behind him, is pushed through
the door, Pole following.
A small crowd of actors, whores, etc., watch the
theater burn. The guards have to push their way
through them.
INSERT
The fire reaches the fireworks below the theater's
stage, and--
BACK TO SCENE
-- the SOUND of fireworks EXPLODING makes Jonson turn
and see:
THE THEATER
Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater.

A longboat carrying Jonson, Pole and the guards makes

The Rose towers above the nearby buildings "Bankside"

SOUTHAMPTON (O.S.)
Well?
TWO MEN
walk towards the theater. Edward de Vere (47), the
Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes
have seen better days.
His companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON
(22). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy-- and
extremely enthusiastic.
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
Wonderful, isn't it?
OXFORD
(frowning slightly)
Well, it's certainly... big.

pg. 9
SOUTHAMPTON
I promise you, Edward, you've seen
nothing like it before! Nothing!
OXFORD
Bricklayers and whores watching
Aristophones?
You're quite right,
Henry, not only have I never witnessed
it, I'm not sure I care to.
SOUTHAMPTON
(teasing)
You're an elitist, you know that,
Edward?
Oxford pauses at the entrance.
OXFORD
There won't be puppets, will there?
Southampton grins and gives a few coins to an USHER,
who escorts the two of them (the retainers stay
outside) inside.
USHER
My lords...
20
Moments later, Oxford and Southampton are exiting the
elaborate building that serves as Essex's London
residence.
OXFORD
Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?
Southampton just nods, distracted.
Oxford reaches out
to him, and touches his shoulder.
OXFORD (CONT'D)
(warning)
Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals.
Southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then--
SOUTHAMPTON
(re: his discussion with
Essex)
You heard?
Oxford nods.
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
Always concerned for me, aren't you
Edward?
They keep walking towards Southampton's men.
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
And what would you have me do?
19
pg. 20
OXFORD
I would have you deny him.
SOUTHAMPTON
The son of the Queen?
OXFORD
That is rumor only, Henry--
They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out
of earshot.
SOUTHAMPTON
Rumor? My god, all you have to do is
look at Essex to see the Queen's
reflection. Everyone thinks he's her
son, everyone! And I for one would
rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though
he may be, than a Scotsman!
OXFORD
I desire nothing more than to see the
next king be the rightful king. But
what Essex contemplates will surely
lead to Civil War.
(beat)
No. If this is to be done, it must be
done carefully, skillfully.
SOUTHAMPTON
As I heard it, Elizabeth exiled you
from her presence for the last twenty
years because of your "skill" at Court
politics.
And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said
that.
OXFORD
I only have your interests in mind,
Henry. For as you so rightly point
out, my interests are already lost.
SOUTHAMPTON
I know. Forgive me. You know how I
feel about you. You have been a great
friend to me ever since my father
died. I promise you that I will do
nothing rash without consulting you
first.
Oxford nods, still worried, and Southampton heads for
his horse.

pg. 21
OXFORD
Henry! Will you do me one thing more?
Deliver a gift for me? A rather...
elaborate gift?

The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor
house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in
design.
It faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area
which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting
the noblemen off for a week-end get away.
22
23
Sheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the
ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift "stage"
surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides.
"BOTTOM"
I see their knavery: this is to make
an ass of me; to fright me, if they
could. But I will not stir from this
place, do what they can.
Chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the
grass. Elizabeth is watching center front row (of
course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a
young woman. Essex is next to her.
24
pg. 25
ON STAGE
Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate
and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man--
except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a
commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now
dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the
fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck
hides behind a tree watching.
"BOTTOM" (CONT'D)
I will walk up and down here, and I
will sing, that they shall hear I am
not afraid.
BACKSTAGE
Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully
observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that
seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep
emotion in him.
ON STAGE
"BOTTOM" (CONT'D)
(sings)
The ousel cock so black of hue,
With orange-tawny bill,
The throstle with his note so true,
The wren with little quill--
Titania awakens in her nest-like bed of fur.
"TITANIA"
What angel wakes me from my flow'ry
bed?
ELIZABETH
strongly reacts to Titania awakening.
It stirs some
memory in her. A pleasant memory.
OXFORD
watches, delighted by her reaction.
FROM HIS POV
We see Elizabeth watching. But it is an Elizabeth only
26 years old (referred to as YOUNG ELIZABETH in this
script). We HEAR the sound of other dialogue, but from
the same play. We are:

Jonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time
in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO--
Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat
of arms on its chest.
The City of London is far in the distance.
Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat
for a moment before--
JONSON
And who are you?
Francesco just stares back.
JONSON (CONT'D)
And where are we going?
Francesco is silent.
WIDER
The boat approaches a large stone house, Oxford Stone.
CUT TO:
A RED ROSE
as it is cut from its bush by ink-stained hands.
We
are:

Oxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he
turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards
him.
Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De
Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one
of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17).
Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand
place. Jonson CLEARS his throat.
JONSON
My lord...
30
pg. 31
OXFORD
The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of
flowers, don't you think?
JONSON
It looks to me to have quite a number
of thorns, my lord.
OXFORD
So it does.
So it does.
JONSON
I am told, my lord, that I owe my
freedom to you.
OXFORD
That is true. And it was quite hard
to come by. One does not cross my
father-in-law lightly.
Jonson doesn't know who he is talking about.
OXFORD (CONT'D)
Lord William Cecil. I have the
questionable distinction of being
married to his only daughter.
Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them
suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and
Francesco to follow.
OXFORD (CONT'D)
It did, however, serve as helpful when
I wrote to your jailers to release you
in my father-in-law's name.
Jonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back
to Anne.
JONSON
(in a panicked whisper)
My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my
release is not officially sanctioned?
OXFORD
Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it
wasn't.
(beat)
But you are free, are you not?
They have come to an entrance to a GARDEN MAZE and Anne
watches them as they disappear into the maze.

Oxford turns to Jonson.
OXFORD
I enjoyed your little comedy last
week, Jonson. You have potential,
great potential.
JONSON
Thank you, my lord.
OXFORD
But it's politics did seem to have
quite an effect on the Tower. My
father-in-law's men felt it quite
seditious.
JONSON
Politics? My play had nothing to do
with politics! It was just a simple
comedy--
OXFORD
That showed your betters as fools who
go through life barely managing to get
food from plate to mouth, were it not
for the cleverness of their servants.
(beat)
All art is political, Jonson.
Otherwise it would just be decoration.
And all artists have something to say,
otherwise... they'd make shoes. And
you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?
As they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to
his servant.
OXFORD (CONT'D)
(nods)
Francesco.
Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather
bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and
opens it.
JONSON
A play, my lord?
OXFORD
One you shall stage Bankside.
JONSON
Stage?
32
pg. 33
OXFORD
Under your name.
JONSON
My name, my lord?
OXFORD
I can't very well use my name, can I?
I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford.
The Lord Great Chamberlain of England,
Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales,
Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc.
No. I have a... reputation to
protect. In my world, one does not
write plays, Jonson. People like you
do.
Jonson tries not to be offended.
JONSON
Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire
play, my lord. I know how difficult--
OXFORD
Not a play, Jonson, I've written many.
No doubt, many more than you yourself.
A good number performed at Court years
ago, others never seen by a living
soul.
JONSON
And you want... me to apply my name to
this play?
OXFORD
No. I mean you to put your name to
all of them.
JONSON
All of them?
OXFORD
Well don't look like I just gutted
your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make
you the most popular-- and therefore
the most monetarily successful--
playwright in all of London.
Jonson pales.
This is a disaster for him.
OXFORD (CONT'D)
I wish you god speed and good morrow.
Jonson looks down at the manuscript, reads a few lines.
33
pg. 34
JONSON
My lord-- I really--
He looks up, but Oxford is gone, having left the maze
without so much as a good-bye.
JONSON (CONT'D)
My lord?
But before he can follow, Francesco tosses a leather
pouch of coins at his feet.
FRANCESCO
That is for your trouble, Signor
Jonson. And your silence. If I hear
you break that silence, then... not so
good for Signor Jonson.
And Francesco follows after his master as Jonson picks
up the pouch, examining its contents.
And then Jonson realizes he doesn't know how to get out
of the maze. He chases after them.
JONSON
Hello?
My lord?! I--
And he's lost. He looks this way and that, then picks
a path (the wrong one).

Robert Cecil is standing at the opulent river
entrance
to Cecil House, waiting for an enormous barge
docking.
William Cecil (now 75) is at the front of the
barge,
waiting to disembark. He constantly holds an
ornately
carved white cane.
WILLIAM CECIL
So! I am gone for three days, and you
somehow manage to let her spend all of
them solely in the company of the Earl
of Essex...
Robert Cecil looks at him sharply.
How did he know.
WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
Don't think because I was in London, I
didn't know exactly what went on here
in my absence.
34
pg. 35
ROBERT CECIL
He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny
him--
WILLIAM CECIL
Of course not! You don't deny him
anything. You find excuses. She is
unwell, she is reading, she is seeing
the Ambassador from Russia. For God's
sake, use your imagination, Robert.
Whatever will you do when I am gone?
(beat)
We will have to deal with Essex soon.
His ambitions are becoming a nuisance.

37
Jonson and Shakespeare are walking along Bankside,
still mid-conversation. They pass all sorts of vendors
selling fish, fresh water, food, etc...
JONSON
I tell you Will-- I came to London to
become a great poet, to, to, be the
conscience of our times, the soul of
our age! To change the world, not to
become someone else's--
SHAKESPEARE
(amused)
Change the world? With rhyme?
JONSON
Yes, why not? Why can't a man change
the world with words?
Shakespeare laughs at him.
JONSON (CONT'D)
(mimicking Oxford)
"I can make you the most popular and
the richest playwright in all of
London."
(takes a swig)
Ballocks! I can do that myself, thank
you very much.

Southampton arrives at the theater.

jumping two steps at a time. We HEAR the sound of
APPLAUSE. The play is now over. Southampton hurries
into--

pg. 53
OXFORD'S BOX
He sees Oxford, who is applauding.
All the actors of
the play are taking their bows.
SOUTHAMPTON
William Cecil's convinced the Queen
that only Essex can save Ireland from
the Revolt.
Oxford processes this.
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
I've pledged to go with him, Edward.
We sail in an hour.
OXFORD
Henry--
SOUTHAMPTON
I ask for your blessing, Edward.
OXFORD
I can't give it to you.

colleague of ours.

Playwright! Playwright!!
Marlowe and others join in.
And--
BACKSTAGE
Shakespeare, standing next to a small table of props,
quickly dips his fingers in an inkwell to make them
stained. He grabs a large feathered quill and tucks a
piece of parchment under his arm, then hurries--
ON STAGE

IN OXFORD'S BOX
SOUTHAMPTON
If he is to be my king, then it is my
sacred duty to be with him in battle.

pg. 54
Oxford tries to understand Southampton, but then
notices Shakespeare on stage. His mouth opens in
shock, and he turns to look across the theater at--
JONSON
who guiltily looks away.
Marlowe's mouth is open, his
hands stop applauding.
IN OXFORD'S BOX
Southampton is angered by Oxford's distraction.
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
I am sorry to have disturbed your
entertainment.
And he exits.
OXFORD
Henry-- Henry!!
But the younger man is gone.
ON STAGE
Shakespeare bows, then--
SHAKESPEARE
I, I... It's been... I, I, want

acting brought... my words... to life
due to their most finest acting.
Ah... Thank you.
OXFORD (O.S.)

Shakespeare and Jonson are walking along London Bridge--
the only bridge that spanned the Thames at the time, it
is a street lined with multi-storied buildings-- almost
like a mall.
Shakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of
"Romeo and Juliet"
SHAKESPEARE
"From ancient grudge break to new
mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil
hands unclean."
(no longer reading)
Incredible!! The whole bloody thing
in verse?!
JONSON
(nonchalant)
It's really not that difficult, if you
try.
SHAKESPEARE
And have you ever tried?
Jonson gives him a sharp look, and pauses to pick some
onions from a stand.
Shakespeare notices a BUXOM BLONDE women selling apples
at the next stand.
58
pg. 59
SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
(performing for the
Blonde)
"But soft, what light through yonder
window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious
moon,
Who is already sick and pale with
grief, That thou her maid art far more
fair than she."
The Buxom Blonde smiles at Shakespeare seductively.
SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
(to Jonson)
I'll have little trouble parting the
legs of barmaids after that
performance!
JONSON
You can't play Romeo.
Jonson leaves the stall, and continues down the street.
Shakespeare hesitates, then gives the girl a dazzling
smile. She smiles back, then Shakespeare runs after
Jonson.
SHAKESPEARE
(to Jonson)
Why not? I won't let that oaf Spencer
have another go at one of my roles.
No-- only Will Shakespeare can pump
the life into Romeo's veins.
(grins at another passing
girl)
And his cod piece!
(beat, desperate)
Ben-- Ben! I'm an actor, every inch
of me, down to my very toes... I want-
- no, I need, crave-- to act. I can't
just idle the day by with--
JONSON
So bloody well act like a writer! And
for God's sake, keep off the stage.
Writers don't have time to act.

"TWELFTH NIGHT"
Viola and Sebastian are reunited...
"CAESAR"
Caesar is attacked by Brutus, Cinna, Cassius, etc...
"MACBETH"
The witches are on stage.
These three performances are INTER-CUT with:
PLAYBILLS
outside the Rose, announcing each play's title.
At
first, Shakespeare's name is small, with each
succeeding play his name gets bigger. And--
AFTER EACH PERFORMANCE
Shakespeare bows to the ever-increasing applause of his
audience. He looks up to see the Mermaid's Wits all
watching him with stony silence.
And as each play is seen, Jonson and the rest of the
Wits seem more and more depressed.
And after each performance, Shakespeare seems to be
greeted with more and more adulation.
The MONTAGE ends with...
68
pg. 69
A PLAYBILL
in front of the theater announcing "William
Shakespeare's Hamlet". Shakespeare's name is now above
the title. We HEAR the audience howl with LAUGHTER as--
63

Oxford is in his usual box, but completely alone.
He
has a smile of satisfaction on his lips while...
JONSON
Looks over to Oxford with astonishment... While on
stage the world sees for the first time "Hamlet"
contemplating suicide.
"HAMLET"
To be, or not to be: that is the
question: whether `tis nobler in the
mind to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune, or to take arms
against a sea of troubles, and by
opposing end them...
Loud thunder and...
RAIN STARTS TO FALL
And as only the stage and the galleries are covered,
the groundlings are pelted with the cold drops of
water. But they stay. They stay. They cover
themselves up, and silently watch on.
"HAMLET'
...To die, to sleep- no more- and by a
sleep to say we end the heartache, and
the thousand natural shocks that flesh
is heir to...
The audience-- soaked, pelted with rain-- watches
immobile.
And then a again a loud thunder clap takes us to the
end of the play...
SHAKESPEARE
Bows to the thunderous applause. It is still raining,
but nobody wants to leave. While-

watch in the crowd, a complex range of emotions, but
jealousy and loathing at the top of the list.

went to the Tower?
MARLOWE

Ben, Ben... I had nothing to do with
that.
Jonson studies Marlowe for a beat and then walks away.
MARLOWE (CONT'D)

To Establish. A foggy day. In the Foreground we see
the maze. Oxford and his fencing master, BEAULIEU
(20's) are in the center of the maze dueling with
rapiers for exercise.
CLOSER
They wear outfits that are slightly more protective
than ornamental.
They duel for a few moments, and then Oxford TOUCHES
Beaulieu's shoulder. The speak entirely in French.
BEAULIEU
Point!
Oxford backs off, as does the fencing master.
OXFORD
(in French)
Bien. Faisons du travail... le Coup
droit d'autorit?
BEAULIE
Mais oui, mon seigneur.
OXFORD
Bien.
En garde!
And they once again begin to duel. But we quickly
surmise something is amiss. Beaulieu is much more
aggressive than he was before. Oxford realizes it, but
is an expert swordsman, and defends himself well.
And then Beaulieu aggressively moves forward, and STABS
Oxford in the leg.
OXFORD (CONT'D)
Qu'est ce que vous faites?
But Oxford has little chance to react, because Beaulieu
continues his attack.

ENTRANCE OF THE MAZE
Francesco is entering the maze with a silver tray
carrying a pitcher and two goblets.
CENTER OF THE MAZE
Though wounded, Oxford is a superior swordsman. And he
begins his own attack-- with a ferocity that surprises
Beaulieu.

Francesco heads for the center as--
IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE
Oxford PIERCES Beaulieu's heart with his rapier, and
Beaulieu SCREAMS--

From high above, we see a carriage arrive.
It stops,
and William Cecil gets out.

Young Oxford (cleaned up) is watching a BOY about five
years old dueling with a tutor. The boy is quite good.
The boy notices Young Oxford, and stops duelling.
BOY
Hello...
YOUNG OXFORD
Hello.
Young Oxford smiles at the boy.
YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
I'm Edward, the Earl of Oxford.
93
pg. 94
BOY
My lord...
The Boy bows, a serious expression on his face.
YOUNG OXFORD
They tell me one day you're to be an
Earl as well.
BOY
I shall be the Earl of Southampton.
YOUNG OXFORD
(smiling)
Well then, we shall be Earls together,
shan't we?

The funeral over, Elizabeth exits the portal of
Westminster Abbey and heads to her carriage. A huge
crowd of mourners has assembled.
Robert Cecil steps into place right behind her.
ELIZABETH
We wish to recall Essex from
Ireland...
Robert Cecil is instantly concerned, but hides it well.
They continue to walk.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
We feel a terrible void, now that your
father is no longer at our side...
Robert Cecil bows his head as he walks.
ROBERT CECIL
A wise decision, your majesty. If
nothing else, it will give him an
opportunity to respond to all these
rumors.
Still walking, she turns to him sharply.
ELIZABETH
Rumors?
ROBERT CECIL
I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd
heard.
ELIZABETH
Heard what?
ROBERT CECIL
Essex is in negotiations with Philip
of Spain...
ELIZABETH
Peace is at hand. We know this.
ROBERT CECIL
Majesty-- it is said that Essex has
promised Phillip all of Catholic
Ireland in return for...
He hesitates.
95
pg. 96
ELIZABETH
In return for what?
ROBERT CECIL
Spain's support of Essex's claim to
the throne of England...
They have arrived at her carriage.
ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
(beat)
It is, as of yet, just rumor.
ELIZABETH
Bring him to me, William.
Bring him
to me at once!
ROBERT CECIL
(correcting)
Robert, majesty.
Elizabeth stares at him for an instant, then gets into
her carriage, unsure of herself.
ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
My father's death has been a great
loss for us all...
She ignores him, trying to collect herself. Robert
Cecil turns to the driver, NODS, and the carriage takes
off.
As soon as it is away, Robert Cecil turns and some in
the crowd of commoners begin to BOO at him.
CUT TO:
HORSE HOOVES
as they gallop over emerald green grasses.
We are:

A group of horsemen gallop into Essex's camp. A
MESSENGER jumps off his horse and heads for Essex's
tent.
93
95
Southampton and Essex are on horseback, followed by
several dozen armed retainers, GALLOPING towards the
city of London.
96

The party rides into the first gate. The palace is the
city residence of the Queen, and is at the edge of the
City.
99
pg. 100
Essex and Southampton jump off their horses.
97
101
It looks like an armed camp, with part of Essex's army
encamped in the front courtyard. The soldiers are all
tense.
Oxford, followed only by Francesco, rides into the
courtyard. He is immediately surrounded by armed men,
their muskets pointed at him. Oxford raises his hands.
OXFORD
I am Edward, Earl of Oxford.
SOUTHAMPTON
Edward!
Edward! Thank god you're
here.
Southampton comes towards him.
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
Elizabeth has revoked all of his royal
licenses! She believes every lie
Cecil tells about him.
(seeing Oxford's wound)
Edward? What happened to your leg?
101
pg. 102
OXFORD
(shrugs)
Nothing.
Oxford continues towards the door. Southampton
follows, his concern for Oxford's wound noticeable.

Shakespeare exits the Print Shop, continuing to read
the book, now out-loud.
SHAKESPEARE (V.O.)

Ben Jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands. He
stops for a moment when he sees the new Globe theater.
Workers are still painting the walls.
He pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a
performance of "Richard III" on Monday next.
110A
- NIGHT
112
Jonson stumbles down the streets, alone, deep in his
own private hell. It's raining.
WHORE
Fancy a tumble? Only sixpence!
Jonson waves her off.
He looks up and sees:
FROM HIS POV:
The Tower of London. He makes a decision.

From high, high above a city of 200,000 souls. It's a
beautiful sunny day, but black storm clouds are on the
horizon.
All of London is on its feet. They all are on their way
to Bankside.
The London Bridge is crammed one way. The River Thames
is full of many small boats of theatergoers.
117
117
We see that a huge crowd has formed in front of the
Globe.
118
119
Oxford is in a long-boat, headed for Whitehall Palace.
The oars of the boat cut neatly and silently into the
water.
120
124
The huge crowd has stayed in front of the Globe. It
seems they are waiting for something. We hear hissing
and booing from the crowd inside the theater.
"GLOUCESTER"
...and that so lamely and
unfashionable that dogs bark at me as
I halt by them.

Essex mounts his horse, Southampton at his side. Their
sixty or so men behind them ready for the march to
Elizabeth.
ESSEX
Edward knows what he is doing...
Does
he not?
SOUTHAMPTON
He promised us a mob. They'll be
here.
Essex looks concerned, but says no more.
127
- DAY
128
Soldiers move people and carts off the street. Others
put CANNONS into place and then cover them with canvas
tarps.
"GLOUCESTER" (O.S.)
Inductions dangerous, by drunken
prophecies, libels and dreams, to set
my brother Clarence and the king in
deadly hate the one against the other.

130
The BELLS of St. James' Cathedral mark the hour as five
o'clock. Essex looks to Southampton nervously.
131
132
The mob pours out of the doors.
Storm clouds are gathering.
A RUMBLE of thunder sounds
in the distance.
133
134
The crowd pours through Bankside, growing in numbers as
more people come out of taverns, whore-houses, etc...
A shop-owner comes out of his store, confused.
Another
MAN grabs him.
MAN
To Essex!
And then to the Queen!
(joins in the chanting)
Ess-ex! Ess-ex!
The shop-owner begins to get the spirit of the mob.
135
135
If anything, the crowd is twice the size it was moments
ago. They head down the shop-lined bridge, full of
bravado.
120
pg. 121
JONSON
is in the middle of the uncontrolled mob.
He spots
Francesco nearby.
WIDER
The mob has to slow down on the bridge. There is not
much room. And then it happens!
We are at the front of the mob, when the first soldiers
appear and pull down the tarps revealing the cannons.
People scream as an Officer appears and--
OFFICER
Fire!
And then the cannon FIRES. There is PANIC all around,
and-
JONSON
runs with the crowd, trying to escape.
137
137
Essex and Southampton look tense.
They expected a mob
here by now.
SOUTHAMPTON
They should be here by now...
Essex frowns.
ESSEX
We go as we are! Now!!
And he spurs his horse, and GALLOPS down the street.
ESSEX (CONT'D)
To the Queen!
Southampton has no choice, and follows.
So do the 60
or so men behind them.
136
139
The mob is in panic.
And--
JONSON
is in the middle of it.
FRANCESCO
Signor Jonson! We are betrayed!
Run!
Run!
Jonson looks on in horror as Francesco is KILLED by a
soldier wielding a pike.
140
140
Essex and his men ROAR past the token guards at the
front gate, and gallop into the--
MAIN COURTYARD
Essex rears his horse, looks around at the many windows
that surround them from above.
ESSEX
To the Queen! To the Queen!
His men repeat his plea.
And then, once again, another
trap springs.
THE GATE
SLAMS closed.
And--
GUARDS ARMED WITH MUSKETS
line up in a colonnade in the story above.
Pole is in
command.
POLE
Take your aim!
SOUTHAMPTON
realizes--
122
pg. 123
SOUTHAMPTON
It's a trap!
ESSEX
Spread out!
But before his men can obey--
IN THE COLONNADE
Pole orders--
POLE
Fire!!
IN THE COURTYARD
AND a hundred shots FIRE down into Essex and his men!
141
141A
Pole walks down the colonnade.
POLE
Re-load!
142
143
Another fusillade is SHOT, and more of Essex's men go
down.
And then doors OPEN on the ground floor, and guards
RUSH out to take down the survivors.
Essex and Southampton valiantly fight, but there's just
too many.
They're soon surrounded... And Essex, knowing all is
lost, raises his sword in defeat.
Southampton sees this, and does the same.
144
145
It's raining, hard.
Oxford almost stumbles out of the building onto the now
empty courtyard. The remains of the battle are still
visible. Wounded, screaming horses struggle to
stand...
Oxford's a shell-- devoid of emotion. Broken. Hardly
alive at all. He drops to his knees, the rain pouring
down on him.
We see the silhouette of a man watching through a
window from the second story above. It's--
145A
146
Oxford is sitting in a chair, watching the river
Thames, alone. Snow is falling and Oxford is covered
in a thick blanket. He looks ill.
Anne walks up behind him.
ANNE
Sentence has been passed.
Oxford looks over at her.
Anne smiles.
This news
gives her great pleasure.
ANNE (CONT'D)
They are to be be-headed.
(with venom)
Both of them. Essex tomorrow,
Southampton in a week.
(beat)
Your son is going to be killed,
Edward. By his own mother. Put that
in one of your plays!
And she leaves him with that.
147
147
Essex-- dressed in black, but with a bright red
waistcoat-- is led up a scaffold by guards, his hands
bound behind him.
Snow covers the courtyard. There are only a few
witnesses, as befitting Essex's rank.
ESSEX
stands, looking at life one last time. The Executioner
approaches with an axe. Essex turns, realizing it is
time.
ESSEX
Strike true.
He kneels, resting his head on a wooden bench.
127
pg. 128
ESSEX (CONT'D)
God save the Queen!
And BAM!
Just as the axe lands we--
CUT TO:
FROM A WINDOW
we see the body of Essex fall onto the scaffolding, his
head into a basket. We are:

The bell-ringing comes from St. Paul's Cathedral, the
largest church in the City.
CUT TO:
151
151
On the frozen river Thames we see the funeral
procession for the greatest Queen England has ever
seen. Everybody follows the carriage with the casket
of the queen.
All the lords and ladies of the land.
All wear
elaborate black clothing.
First is Robert Cecil.
Proudly.
Not far walks Oxford.
He is a statue. Devoid of emotion. And then joyous
CHORAL MUSIC replaces the CHURCH GONGS as we--
CUT TO:
A GOLD CROWN
as it is placed on a head.
We are:
131
pg. 132
152
153
It's foggy. Oxford stands next to a carriage, waiting
as the gates open, and Southampton-- scruffy and a bit
worse for wear-- is escorted out.
Southampton smiles weakly when he sees Oxford waiting
for him. The two men walk towards each other and
embrace.
Both men have tears in their eyes.
SHAKESPEARE (O.S.)
No, no, no, no.
CUT TO:

155
Jonson-- only semi conscious-- is carried by the actors
and dumped into the street. They leave him there. He
wallows in the mud for a beat. Then--
SERVANT (O.C.)
Master Jonson?
Jonson looks up to see one of Oxford's servants
standing above him.
133
pg. 134
156
159
Jonson exits the building and walks away. He reads the
dedication on the first page of the manuscript as he
walks.
JONSON (V.O.)
To the Earl of Southampton. The love
I dedicate to your lordship is without
end; whereof this pamphlet, without
beginning, is but a superfluous
moiety.
Jonson freezes, and looks back at Oxford's house,
realizing there is another whole layer to all this;
exactly what he can only guess.
CUT TO:

A casket is being interred into the family mausoleum.
Anne is there, as are Oxford's children. So is Robert
Cecil.
JONSON (V.O.)
Were my worth greater, my duty would
show greater; meantime, as it is, it
is bound to your lordship, to whom I
wish long life... still lengthened
with all happiness.
Southampton is there as well.
Watching. Tears roll
down his cheeks.

Jonson is getting released. He walks away....a lonely
figure.

Wide from above...Still smoking from the fire....All
the sudden we make out Jonson searching through the
rubble.
164A
164B
Jonson's eyes search the ground.
And, eventually, he
finds it--
THE METAL BOX
that seems to somehow have survived the conflagration.
JONSON
opens the box.
INSIDE THE BOX
Are the manuscripts Oxford gave him. Jonson smiles,
relieved. They are singed at the edges, but they are
there. We hear--
PROLOGUE (O.S.)
O-- for a muse of fire... that would
ascend the brightest heaven of
invention...
DISSOLVE TO:
AN ACTOR
playing Prologue. He is the same actor who introduced
the "play" at the beginning of the film. But now he
wears Elizabethan clothing-- but again, all
monochromatic and grey.

PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
