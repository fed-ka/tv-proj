      INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY11

        A continuous flow of GUESTS, VISITORS and EMPLOYEES moving 
      through and mingling in a large, high-end hotel lobby.  
      Everyone seems to be enjoying the day --

      -- all except one. DAMIAN LAKE.  38.  Handsome, well-groomed, 
        business-casual.  Could be mistaken for a doctor, producer, 
      financial adviser -- if it weren t for the observant, 
      predatory eyes.

      Lake s eyes flicker toward TWO MEN: also casually dressed.  
      But their build and demeanor suggests military experience.

      From a cloistered seating area -- DAVID SINCLAIR watches.     
      He speaks softly into a concealed mic.

                                  DAVID
                    Suspect, plus two, on the move.

      As we PUSH in TIGHT on Lake s face, the image FREEZES --

                                                                              PRELAP:
                                  ROBIN (V.O.)
                    Would you please identify that man?

      INT. COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY22

      -- PULL OUT from the image revealing it s VIDEO SURVEILLANCE.  
      We re inside a packed courtroom. A trial is underway. ROBIN S 
        prosecuting. David s on the witness stand.

                                  DAVID
                    Damian Lake.

                                  ROBIN
                    Is he in this courtroom right now?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                NUMB3RS: 515/94: "Guilt Trip" - Rev. Green - 1/12/09    2. 

      CONTINUED:22

      David points to the defendant, the man from the hotel.  
      Beside him is a DEFENSE ATTORNEY and Jury Consultant MITCH 
      LANGFORD, 55.  Langford, an imposing presence, eyes the 
      JURORS.

                                  ROBIN (cont d)
                    Let the record show, the witness 
                      identified the defendant.
                          (to David)
                    And then what happened?

      INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY33

      ERICA DANIELS, 31, gorgeous, impeccably attired.  But too 
      intelligent and determined-looking to be just eye candy. 

      She approaches Lake with a confident smile.

                                  ERICA
                    Baby, there you are...

                                  LAKE
                    Where s our friend?

      -- watching all of this from nearby is NIKKI --

      INT. COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY44

      Nikki s on the stand; Robin paces --

                                  ROBIN
                    Why was the FBI surveilling Mr. 
                    Lake?

                                  NIKKI
                    Damian Lake owns Consultants 
                      International, which operates a 
                    fleet of cargo planes suspected in 
                    the transfer of illegal weapons to 
                    elements in 16 countries including 
                    Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. 

                                  ROBIN
                    Why was the FBI at the Crown Prince 
                    Hotel that day?

                                  NIKKI
                    We set a meeting between Mr. Lake 
                    and an undercover agent.                NUMB3RS: 515/94: "Guilt Trip" - Rev. Green - 1/12/09    3. 



      INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY55

      COLBY waits, in plain-clothes, shopping bag in hand, as Erica 
      walks Lake up to him.  

                                  COLBY
                    Lake?  Jack Higgins.

      Colby extends a hand.  Lake eyes Colby.  Doesn t shake.

                                  COLBY (cont d)
                    If we re not gonna deal, there s an 
                    excellent spa here.  A win either 
                    way for me.

                                  LAKE
                    Jack -- heard you got your start 
                    supplying the IRA when the Libyan 
                    pipeline ran dry in  97.

                                  COLBY
                      Opportunity knocked.  Fortunately 
                    in this business, when one market 
                    dries up, there s always another.

      OFF Erica, nervously watching the exchange --

      INT. COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY66

      Colby testifies --

                                  COLBY
                    Erica Daniels was an FBI informant.

                                  ROBIN
                    She was also Mr. Lake s girlfriend. 
                    Why did she agree to work with the 
                    FBI?

                                  COLBY
                    Her brother s done two tours in 
                      Afghanistan. The idea that a weapon 
                    Lake sold to Al Qaeda might be used 
                    to kill him was intolerable to her.  

                                  ROBIN
                    What was her role in the operation?

                                  COLBY
                    To present me as a buyer looking to 
                    purchase missile guidance chips.                 NUMB3RS: 515/94: "Guilt Trip" - Rev. Green - 1/12/09    4. 



      INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY77

      Colby with Lake and Erica --

                                  LAKE
                    How d you find me?  You don t look 
                    up fire-and-forget guidance systems 
                    in the Yellow Pages.

                                  COLBY
                    Viktor Tramasco --

                                  LAKE
                    Viktor.  Terrible thing what 
                    happened in Barranquilla.

                                  COLBY
                    The good thing about Viktor s death 
                    -- it was quick. FARC rebels 
                    would ve tortured him.

                                  LAKE
                    The other good thing is you don t 
                    have to pay Viktor s finder s fee.

                                  COLBY
                    Would ve paid it. Anti-tank 
                    missiles without targeting chips -- 
                    pretty damn worthless.   

      Lake signals; one of his men (FOX) approaches --

      ON NIKKI -- DAVID -- DON -- ND AGENTS -- all plainclothes -- 
      maintaining  civilian  movement -- watching as- 

      -Fox pulls out a small metal CASE from his jacket.  He 
      unlatches it.  Inside, SIX MISSILE GUIDANCE CHIPS.

      Back with Lake, Colby and Erica-

                                  COLBY
                    He s no Vanna --
                          (re: chips)
                    But I d like to buy  em.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                NUMB3RS: 515/94: "Guilt Trip" - Rev. Green - 1/12/09    5.

                                  LAKE
                    I take cash.

      Colby lowers his shopping bag next to Lake s feet.  Fox steps 
      toward Colby -- about to hand him the METAL CASE.

      Erica relaxes, lets out a breath.  Lake sees, signals Fox to 
      stop.

                                  LAKE (cont d)
                    You look relieved.

                                  ERICA
                    What -- what do you mean? 

      Lake gives her a hard look. Erica gets scared, instinctively 
      looks to Colby for help. She shouldn t have...

                                  LAKE
                          (to Fox)
                    Take a walk.

      Fox pockets the CASE, heads off- 

      ON DAVID -- watching --

      ON DAVID -- as he and other ND AGENTS break their civilian 
      patterns and close in on Lake, Colby and Erica.

                                  DAVID
                          (into radio)

      Carl Daniels sits across from Colby and Robin.   

                                  CARL
                    I was on the other side of the 
                    world when Erica was killed.
                          (considers the irony)
                    She worried about me over there.  I 
                    was always the little brother she 
                    had to take care of.  

                                  ROBIN
                    She was proud of you.

                                  CARL
                          (emotional)
                    She thought she could make the world 
                    safer by stopping one gun-runner?

                                  COLBY
                    Erica thought it would make you 
                    safer.  Make a lot of men serving 
                    this country safer.  

                                  ROBIN
                    When she realized what kind of man Lake 
                    was, she tried to do the right thing.

                                  CARL
                    My sister made a lot of mistakes in 
                    her life. I didn t think trusting 
                    the government to protect her would 
                    be one of them.

                    Not how.  But whether the verdict

                    Mr. Lake s defense team hired my 
                    services as a jury consultant.

                                  NIKKI
                    In other words, you helped Damian 
                    Lake s attorneys select a jury that 
                    would return a favorable verdict 
                    for their client.

                                  LANGFORD
                    Jury consulting is part of the 
                      adversarial process.  Check my 
                    records; I work for the prosecution

                    Seems to me everything you tell 
                    them, they could get from a 
                      questionnaire.

                                  LANGFORD
                      A questionnaire can t tell them 
                    that a juror s attitude is a 
                    stronger indicator of bias than 
                    their demographic -- or that 
                    attitudes towards rape are better 
                      verdict-predictors than gender.

                    Is that your scientific opinion, or 
                    the way you convince rapists to pay 
                    your fee?

      EXT. DAMIAN LAKE ESTATE - DRIVEWAY/GATE - DAY2222

      An imposing property.  Lake walks out the front door toward a 
      Bentley convertible.  Standing there, leaning against his SUV 
      is Don -- waiting.  Lake doesn t show a trace of surprise.

                                  LAKE
                    Really should consider something a 
                    bit more fuel efficient.

                                  DON
                    Gate was open.

                                  LAKE
                    Let me guess -- this is where you 
                    tell me that it s not over, that 
                    you re going to find another way to 
                    put me in jail.

      Don nods matter-of-factly.

                                  DON
                    You got a half dozen federal agencies 
                    on your ass. Just a matter of time.

                    it ll be for killing Erica Daniels. 

                                  LAKE
                    That s a legal impossibility.  
                    Something called  double jeopardy.   
                    Maybe you ve heard of it.

                                  DON
                    Yeah?  Ever heard of a mistrial? 

      Don smiles slightly, knowingly.  Lake stares.  Trying to 
      gauge what Don knows or doesn t know.

                                  LAKE
                    Maybe -- it s just that you and the 
                    DA did a bad job.  I m a innocent 
                    man, free to leave the country.  Go 
                    wherever I want.  There s a world 
                    of places where you can t touch me.

      Lake pulls around the SUV and drives out the gate.

                    Hey.  Wanna grab lunch?  I m meeting an 
                    old buddy from high school.

                                    CHARLIE

                                  ALAN
                      Surprisingly well so far.   

                                    CHARLIE
                    I wonder if the anthropologists 
                    studying community networks in 
                    southern Africa imagined their 
                    research leading to  friending  and 
                       scrabulous.

                    Like the space program giving us 
                    Tang and Velcro. How s your 
                    research into jury tampering going?

                                    CHARLIE
                    My analysis says there s a good 
                      probability the jury s verdict was 
                    the result of tampering. But 
                      probability isn t enough for a 
                    judge.

                                  ALAN
                    Can t blame Don for taking this one 
                    hard. The system let them down. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    The system s not flawless. 

                                  ALAN
                    No, it s not. Once you involve 
                    human judgment, you re going to get 
                    mistakes. No way around that. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Unless -- instead of always mopping 
                    up, we keep the mess from ever 
                      happening.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I don t know yet.  But probability 
                    can be used as a predictive tool.  
                    Maybe you can alter the 
                      circumstances so the potential 
                    crime is less likely to take place. 

      OFF Alan, giving that thought.

      ON THE BOARD:  A scale from 1 - 100 is broken into three 
      sections (47 and below) (48 - 52) (52 and above); each juror 
      is listed on the scale according to their score.

                    Probable juror bias.  
                          (re: the board)
                    A score of forty-seven and below 
                    indicates the juror was pro-
                      prosecution. Fifty-two and above is 
                      pro-defense. In between means their 
                    bias was negligible.

                    car accident.  Why, think there s

                    Given the parameters of this case -- 
                    I d say there s a high probability.              NUMB3RS: 515/94: "Guilt Trip" - Rev. Green - 1/12/09    32.

                                  DAVID
                    According to CHP, the investigating 
                    officer ruled your husband s 
                    accident a single car wreck?

                                  ARLENE
                    They said he was speeding. With me 
                    on that jury, Paul had to juggle 
                    work, the house, the girls. Maybe 
                    he was overwhelmed, in a hurry... 

                                  DAVID
                    Had he been in accidents before?

                                  ARLENE
                    He d had a few tickets in the past, 
                    but not since the girls were born.   
                          (then)

                    Maybe we should take a look in that 
                    white van across the street. Think 
                    we ll find any illegal firearms?

      Fox shakes his head, exasperated.

                    Go look in the van if you want.

                    but you guys might consider stolen

      INT. AVENUE DELI - DAY4747

      A bustling deli. David and Colby question TRISHA MORENO, part-

                    Juror guy, yeah, I remember him.

                          (off her look)
                    Did you give it to him?

                    I don t go for chicken salad.

                    I hung onto the number.
                          (re: their looks)
                    Just because I don t go for chicken 
                    salad, doesn t mean chicken salad 
                    don t go for me.

4848EXT. AVENUE DELI - MINUTES LATER

      INT. SILVER S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY/STAIRWELL - DAY4949

      Colby and David round a corner, hear a door open, see --

      A MAN steps out at the far end of the hall. JUSTIN CERF/GREGG 
      SILVER.  COLBY and DAVID lock eyes on him.

                                  DAVID

      Gregg Silver stares a beat -- can t tell who he s looking at

      Silver sprints off and up a stairwell -- Colby and David 
      pursue --

      EXT. SILVER S APARTMENT BUILDING - ROOF/FIRE ESCAPE - DAY5050

      Silver emerges onto the roof.  No way off -- except for a 
      fire escape.  Colby and David appear as Silver climbs onto 
      the fire escape.  David quickly backtracks as Colby pursues.

      Silver makes his precarious descent, racing down the stairs -- 
      until he sees David emerge out of the building, onto the fire 
      escape platform one story below.

                                  DAVID
                    Hey!  Stop right there.

      Silver glances up -- Colby above him. Options dwindling.  40 
      feet away, an OPEN WINDOW.  Desperation drives him out --

      -- onto a narrow LEDGE.  Silver starts traversing the ledge.  
      David watching -- not sure what to do.

                                  DAVID (cont d)
                    Gonna get yourself killed.  How 
                     bout we discuss this inside? 

      SILVER S POV -- vertigo is setting in... 

                                  SILVER
                    I m dead either way, man.

      Silver inches toward the open window -- hand reaching out to 
      the edge of the window frame.  But he suddenly loses balance, 
      one foot slips -- about to fall, when -- 

      Colby grabs Silver s arm, pulls him to safety.

      Colby with Gregg Silver.  He s smart, guarded.

                    I didn t know what I was hired to 
                    do. I just did what I was told.

                                  COLBY
                          (reads off file)
                    You re a diversified con-man, I ll 
                    give you that. Multiple convictions 
                    for fraud -- mail, phone, wire...

                                  SILVER
                    I don t hurt people. 

                                  COLBY
                    A lot of people got hurt in this 
                    case.

                                  SILVER
                    I don t know anything about that.

                                  COLBY
                    What I care about -- is what you 
                    did while you were on the jury.

      Silver considers his options, then:

                                  SILVER
                      I listened to the evidence, I 
                      deliberated with the other jurors, 
                    I cast a vote. Same vote as 
                    everybody else. Why single me out?

                                  COLBY
                    You created a fake identity, went 
                    along with a plan to put that fake 
                    person on a jury.  That much we can 
                    prove, and that s a serious felony.

                                  SILVER
                    Talking to you doesn t get me 
                    anything.

                    we ll just stick you back out on 
                    the street, and make sure everybody 
                    knows you were in here.

      Silver looks alarmed. 

                                  COLBY (cont d)
                    You can go hang out with your buddy 
                    Robert Logan. Oh that s right. He s 
                    dead. 

      OFF Silver s realization of how screwed he is.

      EXT.  ECHO PARK BOATHOUSE - NIGHT5252

      The front door swings open, in walks --

      MITCH LANGFORD.  Standing in the shadows is Gregg Silver. 

                                  LANGFORD
                    What the hell are you thinking?

                    I don t want to end up like Logan.

      Langford slips him a thick envelope --

                                  LANGFORD
                    You won t. Just make sure I don t 
                    see your face again.

                    How about my face?

      Langford spins around, finds Nikki standing behind him.  

      He eyes the door, about to make a run for it -- when DAVID 
      comes in -- weapon drawn.

                                  DAVID
                    Hands on your head.

                    game without even realizing it.

      Robin takes a hard look at Langford.

                                  ROBIN
                    Right now we re reviewing recent

                    Silver s talked.  You were the 
                      mastermind behind the scheme, but 
                    the guy who paid for it s gone.

                    Unless you answer one question, and 
                    answer it right.

      EXT. ARUBA - PRIVATE RESIDENCE - DAY5555

      An opulent, personal paradise.  Lake lounges in a recliner. 

      A SHADOW 

      -- over him. He glances up at the bottom of a drink tray. 

                                  LAKE
                    Leave it on the table.

      The drink is placed beside him; Lake reaches for it, when --

      -- SNAP -- his wrist is handcuffed -- he looks up to find...

      TWO LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS -- standing over him.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)              NUMB3RS: 515/94: "Guilt Trip" - Rev. Green - 1/12/09    53.

                    Guys -- you re making a big 
                    mistake.  This is a private 
                      residence, you can t just --

                    man with plans. Going to be running 
                    this office one day?

                    I have no idea where d you hear 
                    something like that. Better check 
                    your sources. 

      Nikki gives him a grin, stands.

                                  NIKKI
                    My sources are pretty good.

      She walks away; David approaches his desk, a document lies on 
      his chair.  He picks it up, revealing --

      A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION addressed to the career board ...

      INT. FBI - HALLWAY - NIGHT5757

      Through the glass we see Robin speaking with Carl Daniels 
      (Erica s brother).  He s emotional, but thankful...

      Watching this -- DON.  Robin exits the room, approaches -- 

                                  ROBIN
                    How was your flight? 

                                  DON
                    I enjoyed it. A lot.  
                          (off Daniels)
                    How s he doing?

                                  ROBIN
                    He s grateful Lake won t get away 
                    with murdering his sister. But it 
                    doesn t change what happened. He 
                    feels kinda lost, and so do I. 

      Don absorbs this, then -- 








                                                                            (CONTINUED)              NUMB3RS: 515/94: "Guilt Trip" - Rev. Green - 1/12/09    55.

                                  DON
                    You can never really be lost, 
                    Someone s already marked the way.

      Robin looks to him, curious.

                                  ROBIN
                    What are you talking about?

                                  DON
                    Jewish law, Halakha -- derived from 
                      scripture. It means  the path.  
                    I ve been studying it. Comforting, 
                    you know...

      Robin nods, thinking.

                                  ROBIN
                    I ve never told you this... never 
                    told anyone -- I almost dropped out 
                    of law school.

                                  DON
                    Why? 

                                  ROBIN
                    A lecture I heard on the philosophy 
                    of law --  Nietzsche argued that 
                     real justice  cannot exist in a 
                    society where people have differing 
                    levels of power. That the powerful 
                    will always exploit the weak.

                                  DON
                          (gently joking)
                    Isn t that why people become 
                    lawyers? 

      Robin smiles -- 

                                  ROBIN
                    Yeah, maybe some of them. But it 
                    made me want to help balance that 
                    fight.  And every case, every 
                    criminal we put away -- brings us 
                    one step closer to  real justice.  

      OFF Robin --

                    That depends... if it takes until

                    I thought the case was wrapped up.

                    It was... it is. But taking one 
                    criminal off the streets doesn t 
                    solve the problem.
