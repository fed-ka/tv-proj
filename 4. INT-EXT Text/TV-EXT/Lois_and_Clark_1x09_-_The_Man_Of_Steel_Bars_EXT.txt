
	Superman FLIES above the burning warehouse district.



	City Attorney PATRICIA CHENG stands before a crowd of
	reporters and concerned citizens on the courthouse steps.
	Clark and Lois are in the crowd and so is Jimmy, who snaps
	photos.

				CHENG
		As the City Attorney for
		Metropolis, I will be seeking an
		injunction tomorrow ordering
		Superman to immediately cease and
		desist in the usage of his super
		powers.

	The crowd responds with boos and hisses.

				LOIS
		Under what authority?

				CHENG
		I am acting under municipal code,
		section 12, article 5, the
		so-called 'Civic Emergency'
		provision.
			(holds up document)
		I have a subpoena for his
		appearance tomorrow morning to show
		cause why he should not be so
		enjoined.  I am making this public
		appeal this afternoon asking him to
		submit to the laws of this
		community.

	The TV reporter, McKee, speaks up.

				MCKEE
		But what if he doesn't?  And if
		he's endangering the lives of
		everyone in Metropolis, shouldn't
		you be issuing a shoot-to-kill
		warrant?

	McKee's done it again.  The crowd goes crazy.  "Kill
	Superman?  Is he that dangerous?  Etc."

				CHENG
		I hope we won't be forced to use
		any extreme measures.

	The impromptu conference breaks up.

				LOIS
		This is lunacy.  We have to do
		something.  Jimmy, find Friez. 
		We'll start with his maps.

				JIMMY
		What are we looking for?

				LOIS
		I'm not sure yet.  But the only way
		to prove it isn't Superman is to
		find out what's really causing this
		heat.

	Meanwhile, Clark has just been standing there, taking it
	all in.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		Earth to Clark.  Hello.

				CLARK
		Sorry, I... it just can't be true.

	She looks at him closely.

				LOIS
		Well, what do you know.  It's
		finally getting to you.

				CLARK
		What do you mean?

				LOIS
		You're sweating.

	But it's not the heat, it's his nerves.

					CUT TO:


	Superman stands on the track, his back arched against the
	forward momentum of a speeding train.  Smoke rises from
	the tracks.  The IMAGE of a thermometer with the mercury
	rising CROSS DISSOLVES over this.

					CUT TO:



	To suggest the summer-type gridlock associated with
	millions of Metropolitans fleeing the city.  Heat waves,
	exhaust, honking horns, moving inch-by-inch.

				RADIO VOICE
		Lex-Con weather and traffic: it's a
		hundred and twenty degrees and the
		freeways are choked as thousands
		flee metropolis for cooler weather.
		In the news, Superman has again
		violated the injunction against the
		use of his super-powers by saving
		three hundred and twenty-five
		commuters on a runaway train...

					CUT TO:



	A full crowd of protestors continue the chant, "Superman
	Must Go."  Lois exits a cab and pushes her way through
	them, moving up the stairs.  Suddenly, the crowd breaks
	out into boos.  It's Superman exiting the front doors.  He
	makes a statement.

				SUPERMAN
		When I first came to Metropolis I
		said I came 'to help.' That's
		still how I feel.  But I'm going to
		have to find another place and
		another way.  I have agreed to
		voluntarily leave Metropolis within
		twenty-four hours.  I believe it's
		the best way to put all your fears
		to rest.  I will miss everyone.
		Thank you.

	Superman begins to move down the steps.  Lois stops
	Superman.

				LOIS
		You can't leave.

				SUPERMAN
		I don't have a choice.

		They can't be right.

	The look between then says it all.  There are no more
	words.  Superman pushes on through the crowd.  Lois
	watches a moment, fighting back the lump in her throat.
	Superman moves through the crowd.  Some of its anger has
	been dissipated by the announcement.  Some scattered
	"goodbyes" along with a few still angry "good riddances."

	A hard object suddenly hits him in the chest and falls to
	the ground.  He bends down and slowly picks it up. With
	the object in his hand, he scans the jeering crowd.

36	SUPERMAN's POV - CROWD	36

	His scan stops at a young BOY who looks away and runs off.
	OFF the expression on Superman's face.

					CUT TO:


	Lois bursts forth from the building onto the street.
	She's lost, looking around, trying to make something
	happen.  She sees McKee, the TV reporter, doing a stand-up
	in front of his camera crew.

				MCKEE
		Superman is taking a super hike and
		not soon enough as far as this
		reporter's concerned.  Not only is
		he responsible for baking
		Metropolis, but rumor has it that
		his force field is the real reason
		the Metropolitans lost the pennant
		this year.

	The gears are turning in Lois's mind.  A plan is hatching.
	She moves in front of the camera.

				MCKEE
			(continuing)
		Hey, we're 'live' here.

				LOIS
			(to cameraman)
		Keep rolling!
			(grabbing microphone)
		Superman, if you can hear this,
		come back!  Or if any of you out
		there know where Superman is, get
		him this message.  We've figured
		this out.  It's not you.  You're
		not the problem and you never were.

		But it's an emergency and we need
		you now!  Meet me at the LexCorp
		Nuclear Plant and I'll explain
		everything.  And Superman, hurry.

	McKee grabs the microphone back and immediately addresses
	the camera.

				MCKEE
		You heard it here first.  There's
		an emergency at Lex Corp's Nuclear
		Plant, maybe even a melt down...

	Clark and Jonathan finish jamming the last box into the
	four-wheeler.  Jonathan slams the back door shut.  Clark
	takes a deep breath, soaking in the moment, the feelings,
	the memories.  Suddenly, Martha comes bounding down the
	stairs:

		Clark!  Clark!
