Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm
room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting
patiently for this year's kids.
A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun,
right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe.
OVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS.
They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting.
Sara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT
smiles up at her.
SARA
Hi. Sara Matthews.
She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple
silver chain around her neck.
R.A.
Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover
country.
She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely.
R.A.
You're in room three-sixteen.
Welcome.
She hands Sara a room key. She fingers it, smiling.
2.
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she...
Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down
the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps
into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off.
Sara stops in front of Room 316.
She opens the door and looks in on:
A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the
hall; twin beds. Heaven.
Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice
here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window.
She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here.
First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her
duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a
YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara.
Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart.
It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed.
SARA
Told you we'd make it.
She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off
the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles
off the other cart.
GIRL
Sorry! Bad driver.
Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --
clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And
peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl
smiles sheepishly.
GIRL
In case of emergency.
(BEAT)
I'm Tracy.
SARA
Sara.
3.
Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.
Sara's half-settled in now. The wall beside her bed is
peppered with fashion pages ripped out of Vogue and In Style.
She sits in a lounge chair, paging through a Vanity Fair
photo shoot. She spots a cool outfit and tears out the page.
A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Sara walks over. She opens it
expectantly to see...
4.
Tracy, Tracy's roommate KIM, and two other HALLMATES. All
dressed to party.
TRACY
Psi U.'s throwing a bash. Let's go.
SARA
Psi U.?
TRACY
They're a frat. Beer... guys...
SARA
I don't know... I might just hang
and wait for my roommate.
Groans all around. "Come on"... "Lame-O"... Sara bites her
lip, considering. She smiles.
SARA
Alright. Just let me change.
The girls cheer.
Sara, Tracy, Kim and the others from the floor are at the
head of the line, stepping into the house. They're met by a
FRAT BOUNCER.
BOUNCER
(motions to a crowded keg)
If you want beer, I'll need ID's.
TRACY
For a frat party?! Seriously?
He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim
steps around him.
KIM
I don't drink anyway.
Tracy looks at her, mouth agape.
5.
BOUNCER
There's punch and non-alcoholic
beer over there...
He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is
around it.
Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.
TRACY
Come on, just us. We won't tell.
The bouncer is tempted but not budging.
BOUNCER
Honestly, I'm just a pledge.
They'll kick me out.
She stomps by him.
TRACY
Wuss.
Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.
TRACY
You want something to drink?
SARA
What's the point?
Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking
extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard.
Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage,
but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large
room.
A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good,
but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and
watches them. In particular --
THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's
mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara
chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He
definitely stands out.
Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in
with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band.
Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the
wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.
6.
TRACY
(yells over the music)
Why aren't you dancing?
SARA
To this?
TRACY
They're not that bad.
Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start
jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as
Tracy chugs her drink.
A DJ rules the room now. Sara and Kim are dancing with
others from the floor. Sara notices a speck of punch on her
shirt. She stops dancing. Wets her fingers and tries to rub
it out.
SARA
Crap.
Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.
SARA
Where's Tracy?
KIM
She was getting more punch.
Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing
onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other
girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively,
egging on the crowd.
SARA
Uh oh.
Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera
phones stretch out above the crowd.
SARA
(SHOUTS)
Tracy.
Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the
stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the
bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd.
7.
SARA
(LOUDER)
Tracy. Don't.
Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who
inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara
gasps.
STEPHEN
Damn!
Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd.
Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up.
STEPHEN
Oh. Woops.
SARA
(ANNOYED)
I have to go clean this up.
She turns.
STEPHEN
Looks like my plan backfired.
Sara turns back towards him.
SARA
What plan?
STEPHEN
To spill beer on you so I can start
a conversation.
SARA
You spilled beer on me purposely?
STEPHEN
(NODS)
You pissed?
She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's
hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a
dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen.
SARA
I'll get over it.
He laughs, making her smile.
8.
SARA
I'm not sure how she's so wasted.
All she's had is punch.
Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand.
STEPHEN
Come on.
Stephen, now with a full beer watches as Sara sips some of
the punch.
SARA
It's pretty good.
She drinks some more.
SARA
It doesn't taste that strong.
STEPHEN
Exactly.
He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of
hers.
STEPHEN
Stephen. By the way.
SARA
Sara.
Stephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup.
Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs,
grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her,
bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that
he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her
other hand.
SARA
Hey, why do you get to drink beer?
STEPHEN
Twenty-one.
SARA
Old man.
9.
STEPHEN
Tell me about it. My back is
killing me.
They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against
his chest.
STEPHEN
Besides, frat brothers don't have
to wear those ugly wristbands.
SARA
Ugh. You're in this frat?
He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people
behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing,
Holding up a cup of punch.
KIM
(SLURS)
Did you try the punch? It's pretty
good.
SARA
What happened to Tracy?
Kim shrugs.
KIM
I'm the worst roommate ever.
Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which
Stephen notices.
STEPHEN
Do you want to look for your
friend?
Sara looks at him sweetly. Nods.
They spot Tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom
of the stairs. Sara rushes over to her. A couple frat boys
stand over her. Not sure what to do with her.
SARA
(BUTTS IN)
I got her.
10.
She struggles to hold Tracy up -- the girl's heavier than she
looks and Sara's balance is not so great, herself. The frat
boys notice her struggling.
FRAT BOY #1
Who's got you?
Tracy nearly brings Sara down to the floor...
But Stephen's there to catch her.
STEPHEN
Guess that would be me.
But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both.
SARA
Who's got you?
Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm. The other arm around
Sara's waist.
STEPHEN
(SMIRKS)
Apparently God.
Sara rolls her eyes.
Sara, Stephen, and Tracy stumble into the dorm lobby. Sara
wears a jacket Stephen gave her for the walk. Kim and
ANOTHER GIRL step forward and grab Tracy.
KIM
Thanks Sara.
SARA
No problem.
They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen... They step into
the elevator. Holding it for Sara.
KIM
You want us to wait?
Sara turns and glares at Kim. An obvious "NO!" Kim lets the
doors close as Sara turns back to Stephen.
11.
STEPHEN
You know, I'm going to be pulling
kitchen duty all week for helping
girls leave a frat party. It's
like opposite everything we stand
for.
Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss. Then separates, but
her lips still very close to his.
SAEA
(low and romantic)
Does that make it worth it?
STEPHEN
Honestly, no.
She laughs out loud.
SARA
Do you want to come up?
STEPHEN
(DEEP BREATH)
More than I can tell you, but that
wouldn't be fair.
Sara starts to take off Stephen's jacket. He stops her.
STEPHEN
Keep it... till next time.
SARA
Thanks again. For everything.
(BEAT)
And, sorry about kitchen duty.
He smiles... and walks away into the night. Sara looks after
him... and now it's her turn to take a deep breath which
suddenly makes her a little more queasy.
Sara heads for her room, holding onto the wall as she goes.
She reaches her door. She takes one more deep breath, then
opens it.
12.
Sara closes the door behind her. Almost pitch black; just a
little moonlight through the window. Sara knocks into her
lounge chair.
SARA
Ow!
She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing
hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may
puke at any second.
She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her
bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing:
The other bed.
Sara screams.
GIRL
Hi.
FLASH. The girl takes her picture, further blinding and
disorienting Sara.
SARA
Who are you?!
GIRL
Rebecca. Your roommate.
Sara calms, catching on.
SARA
What are you doing?
REBECCA
Taking your picture.
SARA
Why?
Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach.
SARA
Oh shit.
Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca
smiles.
13.
Sara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room,
holding her head. The door is slightly open.
It's dark. Rebecca's covers are pulled up to her neck. Her
eyes are closed.
SARA
(WHISPERS)
Rebecca?
No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it,
and turns toward the wall.
Rebecca's eyes open. And they stay open. She watches Sara go
to sleep.
Sara wakes. Headache; dry mouth; the works. The sun through
the window is way too bright. She slowly turns over to see...
Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the
light of day, we see that she's a knockout.
Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that
flank an awesome stereo system.
Rebecca sees that Sara's awake.
REBECCA
Hey Sara.
Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened
last night? Rebecca smiles.
REBECCA
We met last night.
14.
SARA
Right...
(racking her brain)
Starts with a... "T"?
REBECCA
Close. Rebecca.
She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin.
REBECCA
Come on. It'll help, trust me.
Sara washes down the aspirin.
SARA
Thanks.
Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched.
SARA
(SUDDENLY PANICKED)
I didn't throw up on you, did I?
REBECCA
(LAUGHS)
No. You made it to the bathroom.
Sara looks around the room. Her lounge chair has been moved
to her side.
Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various
self-portraits of Rebecca. Sara looks at one where Rebecca
is staring straight back at us. No smile.
SARA
Did you do those?
Rebecca nods.
SARA
They're really cool.
REBECCA
I just like capturing my moods.
A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night
before are coming back to her now.
SARA
Rebecca -- did you take my picture
last night?
15.
REBECCA
(LAUGHING)
Yeah. It's just something I do. For
my drawings.
(BEAT)
C'mon, let's hit the bookstore. The
walk will help your head.
Sara rolls over, groaning.
SARA
It's too damn early for me.
REBECCA
It's three in the afternoon.
Sara's eyes bug out.
SARA
Holy shit!
Sara walks along the back aisle, weighed down with textbooks.
All look used and worn. Fashion Design. Psychology. Calculus.
She spots the last book she needs and reaches for it just as
another GIRL reaches too. They both pull back, neither sure
who has claim to it.
GIRL
So what do we do?
Sara looks her over. Checks out her outfit.
SARA
Nice bag. Dior?
GIRL
(FLATTERED)
Yeah.
Sara snatches the book.
SARA
I'm on financial aid.
16.
Sara finds Rebecca by the art supplies, she's picking up the
stuff she needs. Sara scans Rebecca's books. They're all
art books, shiny and new.
Sara's phone rings. She looks at it: "JASON".
She sighs. Her finger hovers over the "talk" button. A beat.
She hits it right before it goes to voicemail.
SARA
(ANNOYED)
Jason. What are you doing?
JASON (O.S.)
I just wanted to hear your voice.
SARA
I told you not to do this.
JASON (O.S.)
I need to talk to you.
SARA
You're just making it harder.
JASON (O.S.)
Sara, listen I... I want to come
out there.
SARA
(SNAPS)
But you didn't come out here,
remember. That's the problem.
She says it too loud. Other students in line are eyeing her.
SARA (CONT'D)
(QUIETER)
I've gotta go.
Sara hangs up. She exhales, flustered.
REBECCA
That didn't sound good. Boyfriend?
SARA
Ex.
Off Rebecca's confused look.
17.
SARA
It's complicated.
A beat. Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up.
They walk along the stacks of books.
SARA
We dated since tenth grade and were
supposed to go to college together.
(BEAT)
We both applied to Brown. I got in;
he got wait-listed. I stuck to our
agreement and we both committed
here. Then two weeks ago...a spot
opened up at Brown ...and..
REBECCA
No?! He took it?
(Sara nods glumly)
What an asshole.
SARA
Yep.
REBECCA
Do you miss him?
SARA
Sometimes I think I do.
REBECCA
It's hard to let go.
(SMILES)
Believe me, I know. But, you're in
college now. A girl's gotta move
on.
Sara smiles, glad to find a kindred spirit. She looks at her
phone... and stuffs it into her pocket as they reach the
register.
Rebecca sits on her bed, drawing. Sara is putting her books
away on a shelf. As she reaches the end of it, she notices
something out of the corner of her eye.
SARA
Oh my God.
REBECCA
What?
18.
Sara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one
side. But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's KILLER
COLLECTION.
SARA
I am so jealous.
REBECCA
I know... I've got a lot of clothes.
Mind if I put some on your side?
SARA
No problem.
REBECCA
Borrow anything you want. Really. I
haven't worn half of them.
Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta.
Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some
still carry their price tags.
SARA
Jesus, some of these I've only ever
seen in Vogue.
REBECCA
My parents idea of bonding is to
turn me loose in Beverly Hills with
a Platinum card.
SARA
Oh, you here?
REBECCA
Pasadena.
Off Sara's confused look.
REBECCA (CONT'D)
About 20 minutes away.
SARA
That's cool. You can go home on
weekends. Free laundry. Free meals.
REBECCA
Not gonna happen.
Sara gives her a puzzled stare.
19.
REBECCA
It's a long story.. .Let's just say
nothing's free in my house.
She wants to know more... but it's too soon to pry. She nods
at Rebecca's drawing pad.
SARA
Can I take a look?
She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest.
REBECCA
No.
Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came
across pretty harsh.
REBECCA
Not till it's done. Nothing
personal. It's just my... process.
(SMILES)
I wouldn't want to show you
anything unless it was perfect.
SARA
(SMILES BACK)
Sure.
Sara and Rebecca have just finished their dinner.
REBECCA
I thought you were a design major.
Why are you taking Calc and
psychology?
The girls get up with their trays.
SARA
(with a smirk)
I am. I want to be well-rounded.
(off her look)
And they're requirements.
20.
TRACY (O.S.)
Hey Sara.
Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim. Sara walks
over, but Rebecca doesn't follow.
SARA
Hey. Tracy... Kim... this is my
roommate, Rebecca.
She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves
her over.
Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave.
REBECCA
Hi.
TRACY
RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can
we call you?
KIM
How 'bout Reba?
Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me.
SARA
I like Becca.
Tracy's grimace vetoes that one, too.
TRACY
How 'bout Becky?
SARA
Becky's good.
The girls all turn to Rebecca for approval.
REBECCA
I like Rebecca.
Buzzkill.
TRACY
OOOKAAAY.
Rebecca walks out. Sara shrugs at Tracy and Kim.
21.
Sara peeks in the open door of a classroom. Frustration in
her eyes -- the class she couldn't get into.
She watches PROFESSOR ROBERTS -- long-haired, dashing --
lecture his students.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
So... here we are. Design 101. And
each one of you is asking yourself
the same question...
(he taps his own chest)
Who is this guy? Why should I turn
off my Blackberry and pay attention
to him?
Mild laughter from the class.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
I'll tell you why -- because I hold
the keys to the kingdom. Think of
your favorite designers. Marc
Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens.
Magicians, right? I've got news for
you: All of their magic stems from
the same source: the fundamental
principles of design.
(BEAT)
I can teach you those principles.
He lets the power of his words sink in.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
The journey to the catwalks of New
York... Paris... Tokyo... starts
right here, in this room. And all
you have to do is open your minds.
Man, she wants in.
DISSOLVE TO:
22.
Sara stands by the door, watching the students file out. As
the last one leaves, she screws up her courage and walks in.
Professor Roberts is gathering up his papers.
SARA
Professor Roberts?
He flashes a disarming smile.
SARA
I'm sorry to bother you, it's
just...
(BEAT)
I absolutely must take this class.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
I'm afraid we're full. But don't
worry -- Intro Design has three
other sections.
SARA
But you're not teaching them. I
want to learn from the best.
He smiles at her.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
What's your name?
SARA
Sara Matthews.
(BEAT)
I brought a request form.
She holds it out to him. He takes the form, but his eyes stay
on Sara. Roaming over her.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Tell me, Sara -- why should I sign
your request form when I've turned
down a dozen others? Would that be
fair?
Sara's face falls. A long beat.
23.
SARA
No, I guess it wouldn't. Thanks
anyway.
She walks toward the door. Roberts' eyes go to her ass.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
But...
(SHE TURNS)
Who said life was fair? You happen
to have two things I can't teach...
He walks to her... and hands her the signed form.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Style. And Desire.
He smiles, signs the form and hands it to Sara. Sara clutches
the form to her chest, smiling.
Sara and Rebecca sit on their respective beds. Rebecca
listens to her Walkman. Sara types on her laptop.
SARA
Hey.
Rebecca removes her earbud.
SARA
What's your Facebook page? I'll add
you as a friend.
REBECCA
I don't have a Facebook page.
SARA
Myspace?
REBECCA
Nope. I don't spend a lot of time
ON-LINE
Sara stares at Rebecca. No way.
SARA
Come here.
Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's
shoulder.
24.
ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the
corner. Pictures and posts from a dozen friends.
Among them: A STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 20s.
REBECCA
Who's she?
SARA
Irene. She graduated from the Art
Institute out here last year.
REBECCA
(INTRIGUED)
She's an artist?
SARA
A design apprentice for Marc
Jacobs. Hey, check out these
posts.
Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: "Paris was
amazing"... "Milan in the Fall"... "Off to Barcelona"... etc.
SARA
I mean.. .who doesn't have a
Facebook page?!
Rebecca laughs.
REBECCA
Okay, okay. I'll get one.
Tracy knocks on the partially open front door... and marches
right in.
TRACY
Cancel those library plans. Guess
who made the guest list at Rebar?
(BEAT)
You guys in? I trust you have fake
IDs?
SARA
Of course.
REBECCA
I don't.
TRACY
Yes you do. Thanks to my badass
self.
25.
Tracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it
out to her. A peace offering.
Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat... then goes back to her
sketchbook.
REBECCA
I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my
scene.
Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand.
A posh Los Angeles bar. Loud and packed to the gills with
mostly young students. Sara and Tracy stand at the bar,
getting jostled, looking like... two naive college kids.
As they try to get the bartender's attention, older guys
check them out, smiling and mouthing "Hi." Sara tries to
ignore them, but Tracy's in heaven.
TRACY
How great is this? No parents. No
curfews.
SARA
No shit!
They clink their empty glasses in a toast.
SARA
Can I?
She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse.
TRACY
Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk
about the life of the party.
SARA
Don't be mean.
TRACY
I'm just saying.
SARA
She's just a little hard to get to
know.
TRACY
Yeah right...
26.
As Tracy rolls her eyes...
The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods
down the bar at...
TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not
so sure about this.
SARA
What do you think?
TRACY
I think...
Tracy raises her shot glass. She and Sara clink and drink.
Tracy waves at the suits again. Thanks guys.
TRACY
We can do better.
She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor.
Sara and Tracy whirl in the hot mix of bodies. Having the
time of their lives. A HANDSOME GUY moves in, his eyes on
Tracy.
Tracy loves it. They dance together as Sara watches, smiling.
Tracy and the handsome guy drift further away from Sara.
Sara is now dancing by herself. A GUY moves in on her, but
she politely dances away. She scans the dance floor for
Tracy. Where'd she go?
She steps off the dance floor and scans the bar -- no sign of
her.
Sara walks into the crowded ladies' room.
SARA
Tracy?
27.
Rebecca lies in bed, wide awake in the dark. Her cell phone
rings. She stares at it. Two more rings. She picks it up.
REBECCA
Hello?
OPERATOR (O.S.)
Would you accept a collect call
from... Sara Matthews?
REBECCA
Yes.
She smiles.
Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup
of hot, sobering coffee.
Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights
shine right in Sara's eyes... and now turn off.
Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the
car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for
the door.
Rebecca walks up to Sara's booth.
SARA
Nice car.
REBECCA
Thanks.
(BEAT)
So, where's Tracy?
SARA
No idea, I couldn't find her.
Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table.
REBECCA
As long as I'm here... you hungry?
SARA
Starved.
Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu.
30.
REBECCA
I can't believe she ran out on you.
SARA
I know. Thanks for coming.
Rebecca looks up from the menu.
REBECCA
Tracy had her shot tonight.
Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show
you the big city.. .the right way.
And I promise I won't abandon you.
Deal?
Sara smiles.
SARA
Deal.
Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room.
REBECCA
These are the modern pieces. A
little wilder than the old stuff.
She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't
just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed.
Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: "Jason".
She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She
buries her cell phone in her purse.
Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it.
SARA
Okay, I have no idea what this is
supposed to be.
REBECCA
(LAUGHING)
Even I don't get that one. Come
on, I want to show you something.
Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the
background is a banner announcing an upcoming Richard Prince
exhibition.
31.
They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of
Greenmeadow." It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask.
Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her
smock.
REBECCA
This is my favorite.
Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her.
REBECCA
I love how he captures her
personality through her eyes. It's
like she really wants to help you.
Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants
Sara to like this painting.
Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what
Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is
actually pretty sinister.
Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's
hopeful expression. Sara brightens.
SARA
Amazing. I love it.
Sara sits on her bed in sweats, typing on her laptop. Rebecca
sits on her own bed, glancing over at Sara as she draws.
SARA
Guess who I'm listing as my
favorite artist on my Facebook
page?
(BEAT)
Richard Prince.
Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. She walks over to check
out the rest of Sara's Facebook Favorites. Favorite book,
favorite band, etc.
33.
REBECCA
(LAUGHING)
Your favorite movie is "Coyote
Ugly"?
SARA
Don't laugh. It's about a small
town girl making it in the big
city.
REBECCA
Isn't every movie?!
They both laugh.
Rebecca takes down a few of her drawings. In their place, she
puts up a big "Coyote Ugly" poster. She straightens it out.
Satisfied.
She checks her watch and walks to the window. She looks out,
anxious for Sara to come home.
She looks over at Sara's side of the room. Curious, she
starts perusing her things. Books... CDs...
She walks to Sara's dresser and picks up the picture of
Emily. She tenderly brushes Emily's face with her thumb.
She spots Sara's silver chain. She picks it up and places it
around her neck. She fingers it carefully and looks at
herself in the mirror. She smiles.
Sara quickly walks in and closes the door. Rebecca sits in
her windowsill, drawing. Sara sits down on her own bed. She
notices the "Coyote Ugly" poster.
SARA
(TAKEN ABACK)
Wow.
REBECCA
I thought you'd like it.
Rebecca sees the moving bulge under Sara's jacket. She cuts
Sara a look. Sara sighs. Apprehensively, she unzips her
jacket and the kitten pops out. Rebecca sits up. The kitten
jumps over to her bed. She pets it.
REBECCA
Sara...
SARA
I know, I know. It's stupid, and
I've just broken about forty
different dorm rules, and I should
just take it to a shelter...
REBECCA
(BEAT)
What do you want to name it?
Sara's face lights up. She smiles gratefully.
SARA
Really?
35.
REBECCA
It'll be our secret. Just between
us.
Rebecca keeps petting the kitten. Getting more attached.
SARA
I named her in the elevator.
Cuddles.
She smiles and scoops her up. Suddenly, her smile vanishes.
SARA
Is that my necklace?
Rebecca touches it. She'd forgotten she still had it on.
REBECCA
Sorry. I was just trying it on.
Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly
takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it
protectively.
SARA
This was my sister's.
REBECCA
Oh.
Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca.
SARA
You can borrow anything of mine.
Except for this. Okay? It's the
only thing I kept of hers.
Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her.
REBECCA
I'm really sorry.
SARA
It's okay. You didn't know.
REBECCA
Were you two close?
SARA
Yeah. You're the first roommate
I've had since she died. So, it
feels a little odd.
36.
REBECCA
In a good way or a bad way?
Sara smiles.
SARA
A good way.
A cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy
couches. More like a living room than a coffee shop. Lots of
laid-back STUDENTS and...
One stressed-out Sara, dropping drinks off at a table and now
rushing back to the register for the next order. Her CO-
WORKER, clearly stoned, moves in slow motion. Not a care in
his world.
SARA
(TO CUSTOMER)
You wanted a mocha smoothie, right?
O.K. Do you know what's in that?
The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some
ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the
lid, and...
THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her
apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands
her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find...
STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line.
STEPHEN
This seems like a pattern.
Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc.
She leans in and speaks quietly.
SARA
Just because I kissed you doesn't
mean I'll let you cut in line.
STEPHEN
So what does it mean?
37.
She coyly shrugs.
STEPHEN
Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon
are reviving a sacred tradition
tonight.
Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles.
STEPHEN
We're having another keg party.
SARA
I.. dunno. I'm still having
flashbacks from the last one.
Sara laughs.
STEPHEN
You know what? How about if I use
you as my excuse not to go.
Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron.
Sara walks off the elevator, still sky-high. She walks
through the lounge, where Tracy sits on the couch. A
television plays in the background.
TRACY
Hey.
Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold.
SARA
Hey.
TRACY
Psi U. tonight?
SARA
So you can ditch me again?
TRACY
Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And
a hot tub.
SARA
That's your apology?
Tracy jumps up and walks over.
38.
TRACY
What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry
-- I totally screwed up.
Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She
watches Tracy and Sara.
Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs.
SARA
I forgive you.
Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder,
she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile.
Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca
takes it.
SARA
But you're on your own at Psi U.
Because...
(DRAMA BUILDING)
Someone has a date.
Rebecca hears this. She slips back into the room and closes
the door. Sara turns and walks down the hallway.
Sara walks in to find Rebecca slipping into a black dress.
SARA
You look... nice.
REBECCA
(EXCITED)
Thanks. Richard Prince is having a
showing. I bought two tickets.
(BEAT)
Since he's your favorite artist...
SARA
Actually, I... sort of have a date?
REBECCA
(DISAPPOINTED)
Oh. Okay.
Major downer. Rebecca goes back to getting dressed. Heavy
silence in the room. Sara watches her. A beat.
SARA
You know, I could reschedule.
39.
REBECCA
(being a martyr)
You don't have to.
SARA
I want to. On one condition...
Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on
Rebecca. They both look at Rebecca in the mirror. Wow.
Rebecca smiles.
REBECCA
I love it, who's the designer?
SARA
What are you, a label whore?! Who
cares ...I got it at a flea market
and it looks great with the dress.
Rebecca nods in agreement.
SARA
It just needs one last touch...
She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her
dresser. She places them in Rebecca's hand.
SARA
I'm gonna jump in the shower, then
we'll head out.
She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door.
Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the
full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the
mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced.
She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the
skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation...
SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood
trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with
her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear.
Sara and Rebecca at the Richard Prince showing. The paintings
are all similar to the one we saw in the museum. A series of
women, peering at the viewer.
40.
Rebecca wears her hair up, showing off her earrings. Every
guy in the room is checking out these two babes. But
Rebecca's into the art, and Sara is texting Stephen.
ON CELL PHONE: "sorry. next time : ("
Rebecca notices and frowns. Sara puts the phone away and
starts studying the paintings.
We track slowly down the empty hallway, towards the door to
the...
Sara sleeps peacefully. Cuddles lies on top of her, awake.
Her eyes glowing in the dark. Creepy. But not as creepy as...
Rebecca in the other bed. She's staring back at the kitten.
Envy in her eyes. Of Cuddles... or of Sara?
Rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed. She
walks over to Sara's bed... but not to pet Cuddles. She
stands directly above Sara. Looking down at her. If Sara
would simply open her eyes, she'd see her.
Tracy is passed out in her bed. She stirs as she wakes. She
reaches around her, slapping her end table.
TRACY
Water. I need water.
She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She
groans. She grabs an empty cup... opens her door...
And lets out a sharp little scream.
Rebecca sits right across from Tracy's door, her back against
the wall. Staring at Tracy.
41.
TRACY
Rebecca? What are you doing?
Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to
comprehend her. A beat. She stands... and walks to her.
Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose
demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes.
She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca
turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and
smiles. She disappears into her room.
Tracy stands there, spooked.
Sara sits in her Design class. Professor Roberts stands at
the podium. Three white design mannequins behind him, each
sporting a different fashion style.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Contrary to popular opinion, beauty
is not in the eye of the beholder.
It's in the hands of the designer.
Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes
with a text message. She discreetly takes a look.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Who can tell me the difference
between fashion and style?
FROM IRENE: "4th & ford. be there now." Sara smiles at the
message.
Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and
calls on her.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Miss Matthews?
Without missing a beat, Sara replies.
SARA
Fashion's something you can buy,
but style you either have or you
don't.
43.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Exactly. All the money in the
world can't buy you style.
SARA
But it can buy you a good stylist.
The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles.
Sara walks through a design studio. Models and make-up
artists are rushing around, dragging thousands of dollars
worth of dresses. Sara loves the place's chaotic energy.
She knocks on an open door and sees a YOUNG MODEL being
worked on by a designer who isn't much older. IRENE, 28.
IRENE
(mouth full of pins)
Finally.
She gets up to hug Sara. Nearly tearing the dress.
Irene is putting a dress together on a MODEL. Sara watches in
awe. An OLDER DESIGNER walks by... checks on Irene's work...
nods his approval... and leaves.
SARA
I so want to be you when I grow up.
45.
IRENE
Hell, I wanna be me when I grow up.
MAKE-UP GIRL
(TO SARA)
She's going to be a star.
Irene rolls her eyes.
IRENE
You know, your dad left me four
messages last week. Making sure I'm
looking out for his baby.
SARA
Oh god. I hope you told him I'm
closing down the library every
night.
IRENE
I told him I haven't seen you. And
that for all I know you're a crack
ho by now.
Even the model laughs.
SARA
Perfect.
Sara walks along, looking for a table. She spots Stephen
sitting by himself. Drumming on his leg with a pencil.
Ignoring the open textbook in front of him.
She sits down across from him. They both smile.
STEPHEN
I haven't seen you around too much
since you blew me off for dinner.
SARA
Sorry again. Actually, how about
dinner tonight?
STEPHEN
Hellllo. I'm studying.
She takes his book. He's on page two.
SARA
Page two? Busted!
46.
STEPHEN
Yeah, but it's really dense.
Off Sara's smile.
STEPHEN (CONT'D)
Okay. Let's go.
Kim exits the bathroom and passes Tracy coming the other way.
KIM
How's it goin?
TRACY
Hey.
Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she
walks, steps into the bathroom.
She hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste.
She removes the towel and steps into the shower, pulling the
curtain closed. As she shampoos her hair...
The lights go out.
TRACY
You have to be kidding me. Hey!
The only light is some distorted moonlight through the
window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel.
Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall...
The lights come back on. She sighs happily... sheds her
towel... and steps back under the steaming water. A beat.
The lights go off again.
TRACY
Goddammit !
She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now... one
of the other showers turns on. What the hell?
TRACY
Hey, how about turning on the
light?
47.
No response. Yet another shower turns on.
TRACY
Who's out there?
Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along
the wall again. She turns on the lights.
The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers.
Tracy stares at them. A beat.
TRACY
I know it's you.
She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one
curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns
it off. She stares at the other curtain.
TRACY
Sara thinks you're weird. She told
me.
She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off
that shower, too. But she can still hear running water.
She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed
again. The sound of running water behind it.
She walks over.
TRACY
Not funny, Rebecca.
(under her breath)
Bitch.
She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the
curtain open to see...
Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around --
no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the
water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower.
TRACY
Freak.
Just as the warm water starts to relax her...
THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca.
The curtain comes right off the rings.
Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor
hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both.
48.
Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against
the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down.
Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca.
REBECCA
So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me
tell you what I think. I think
you're a little whore, and a bad
influence on her. And I think that
if you tell anyone about... what
I'm about to do... you'll regret
it.
Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other
hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further.
Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she
needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain.
A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face.
Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor,
Rebecca looks down at...
The bloody ring in her hand.
REBECCA
Nice belly ring.
She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away.
Sara and Stephen are sitting on a couch. His arm around her
shoulder, lightly playing with the ends of her hair.
STEPHEN
I'm going to flunk my test
tomorrow, thanks to you.
SARA
Then let's make sure it was worth
it.
She gives him a slow, lingering kiss.
STEPHEN
Duh, joke's on you. I was going to
flunk anyway.
She smiles.
49.
Rebecca sits on her bed, petting Cuddles, blood still on her
fingers, humming the tune that Tracy was humming in the
bathroom. She hears steps and voices in the hallway. She
smiles -- must be Sara.
She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But
the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara.
She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her
cell phone and dials.
Sara and Stephen step off the elevator. Time to say goodbye.
STEPHEN
Thanks for helping me... not study.
SARA
Anytime.
He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca.
Standing just five feet away. Staring at them.
REBECCA
Where were you?
SARA
Oh, hi.
REBECCA
I kept calling and calling.
SARA
Oh. I turned my cell off at the
library and forgot to turn it back
on.
(FRAZZLED)
Rebecca... this is Stephen.
He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him.
REBECCA
I'm going to bed now. I'm glad
you're okay.
She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara
bites her lip, as if to say: "What can you do?"
50.
STEPHEN
You got a curfew?
SARA
Well, she's right...I shoulda
called.
He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the
elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient
doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more
kiss. The doors close.
Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door
and sighs.
Sara and Stephen at a table, books spread around them.
Stephen is reading Rolling Stone.
Sara's on her laptop, checking her Facebook page. She gets a
message for adding a new friend... from Rebecca. She clicks
to add her.
51.
Rebecca sits in a chair on the other side of the library.
Unbeknownst to Sara and Stephen, Rebecca watches them through
the glass.
Sara clicks onto Rebecca's Facebook page. She's listed only
one friend: Sara. She's posted the picture of her and Sara in
front of the graffiti wall. And some of her drawings. And a
picture of a pretty brunette teenager, captioned "Maria."
Sara looks at Rebecca's interests. Favorite Artist: Richard
Prince. Favorite Passion: Drawing. Favorite movie: Coyote
Ugly. Sara smiles. Best Friend: SARA. Her smile fades.
SARA
I'm already her best friend?
STEPHEN
That's a little sad.
SARA
Stop.
But the look on her face says she agrees.
STEPHEN
Maybe she REALLY likes you...if you
know what I mean.
She looks at him quizzically.
SARA
I don't.
He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively.
SARA (CONT'D)
You... are...a...moron.
He grins.
Rebecca watches Stephen kiss Sara, her expression is tough to
read. Is she jealous... or entranced? Sara gets up and
leaves. Stephen goes to the stacks.
52.
Stephen, alone, searches for a book among the remote stacks.
The stacks are massive and endless -- row after row of them.
Stephen thumbs through books, not finding the one he needs.
He drops a book and bends down to pick it up. Over his
shoulder, we see...
REBECCA'S EYES in the space between the shelves. She's in the
next aisle over.
Stephen replaces the book. He walks down the aisle, looking
at the numbers of the books.
Rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle.
Her hands gently brush against the books, her eyes on
Stephen. He turns in her direction and stops in his tracks.
So does Rebecca. She's completely still.
Stephen walks over. He puts his hand on the book that covers
Rebecca. He's about to pull it out and reveal her. But it's
not the right one. He keeps walking.
He reaches the end of his aisle... and Rebecca the end of
hers. She's right around the corner from him. He reads the
markers at the end of the aisle, trying to figure out which
direction to go.
Rebecca's hands are sweaty. She's nervous. Does she want to
get caught? Stephen turns right, away from her, and starts
down the next aisle.
Rebecca softly exhales. And now whispers to herself.
REBECCA
Stephen.
Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He
keeps going, scanning the book numbers again.
STEPHEN
Shit, wrong aisle.
He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's...
EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance.
53.
Rebecca sketches in her bed. She looks at the clock: 1:00
a.m. And no Sara. History is repeating itself.. .and Rebecca's
pissed. She rips out her sketch page and throws it away.
She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair
back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial
button. She starts to dial... but kills the call.
She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly:
A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk
drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen:
"JASON".
A long beat. She pushes the talk button... but just listens.
JASON (O.S.)
Sara?
REBECCA
Mmmm?
55.
JASON (O.S.)
Sara, you answered. Thank you. Can
we talk... about us?
Rebecca's eyes clear. She's in control again. She sits down
on Sara's bed, tossing Cuddles roughly to the floor. And now
she lies down.
REBECCA
(WHISPERS)
I miss you.
She moves her hand across her stomach.
JASON (O.S.)
(RELIEVED)
You do?
REBECCA
I want you, Jason.
JASON (O.S.)
I.. . want you, too. But...
Rebecca's hand moves toward her panties.
REBECCA
I miss touching you. Do you miss
touching me?
JASON (O.S.)
Like you wouldn't believe.
REBECCA
Prove it.
Sara and Stephen slam along the walls, in a fever. Kissing
madly, missing each other's mouths. At his door... he cracks
it open and peeks inside.
His room is a disaster. Definitely a new world record for
empty beer cans, pizza boxes, and strewn clothes.
STEPHEN
Just give me thirty seconds.
SARA
You're kidding.
56.
But he slips into the room and closes the door behind him.
Sara leans back against the wall. Flushed, breathing hard.
Stephen is a whirlwind. He tosses everything -- beer cans,
clothes, study papers -- into one big garbage bag.
STEPHEN
Almost there.
SARA (O.S.)
(through the door)
I'm going to start taking my
clothes off out here.
STEPHEN
Yeah, right.
He's not quite buying it... but he's cleaning faster.
SARA (O.S.)
Oops! There goes my shirt...
She's got his attention now. He speeds up.
STEPHEN
You know I don't believe you.
(WORRIED)
Wait, goddamnit, that's supposed to
be my strip tease.
SARA (O.S.)
There go the jeans.
He's popping breath mints... while clearing off his bed.
STEPHEN
I'm just going to put your clothes
back on and make you strip again.
SARA (O.S.)
Hmmm. What's next? Top or bottom?
Stephen stops and stares at the door.
Sara stands there, fully dressed. She looks down the empty
hallway.
57.
SARA
Who do we have here? Hey guys! Let
me ask you. Bra or panties? Bra?
Okay, okay. Just calm down.
The door swings open. Stephen stands in front of her,
grinning.
STEPHEN
I knew you didn't have the guts.
She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He
tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams
shut behind them.
Rebecca is breathing harder and faster now. Still holding the
phone, from which we hear Jason's moans.
REBECCA
Say my name, Jason. Until I tell
you to stop.
She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow
beside her. Both her hands ease back under the covers.
JASON (O.S.)
Sara... Sara... Sara...
Rebecca writhes, eyes closed.
Sara and Stephen make out in bed, half-naked. He lies on top
of her. Looking into her eyes. Sweet and intimate.
STEPHEN
Sara...
Rebecca writhes and moans.
JASON (O.S.)
Sara... Sara...
They moan together. Louder and louder... and now they finish.
A long beat.
58.
JASON (O.S.)
(catching his breath)
Jesus, Sara. That was incredible.
Rebecca smiles.
JASON (O.S.)
I miss you so much.
Her smile dies. She picks up the phone. A cruel gleam in her
eyes.
REBECCA
Don't ever call me again.
She kills the call. And now deletes it from the phone log.
Sara, hair mussed up but eyes shining. Sara opens her door
and steps in. She's tentative, expecting Rebecca to jump down
her throat. But Rebecca smiles.
REBECCA
Well, good morning.
SARA
Hey. Sorry I didn't call. I forgot
my phone.
REBECCA
No problem.
Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone. She quickly
checks. No calls.
Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles.
REBECCA
Come on...don't I get any details??
SARA
(SMILING)
A nice girl doesn't kiss and tell.
They laugh. A nice, easy vibe between them.
59.
SARA
You want to go get some breakfa--
Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down
the hallway.
SARA
Oh no.
Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed.
Sara turns the corner to see...
The resident assistant, with Cuddles cradled in her arms.
Sara apprehensively walks up to him.
R.A.
Is this your cat, Sara?
SARA
Maybe...
R.A.
She's cute...
She nods as she gingerly takes Cuddles from his arms. She
turns to walk back to the room.
R.A.
And if you keep her, I lose my job.
Do we understand each other?
She stops. Turns. Looks at him.
SARA
Yes.
Sara walks back to her room. Rebecca stands in the doorway.
They exchange despondent looks. Screwed.
Irene opens the door and Sara walks in.
IRENE
What took you so long?
SARA
I walked.
60.
IRENE
You didn't!
SARA
It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a
student.
IRENE
Sara! You can't just walk around
downtown L.A. at night. This is
not Des Moines.
SARA
Duh?
IRENE
Seriously, listen to me. That's
why I own a gun.
Sara's shocked.
SARA
What?!
IRENE
Absolutely! Big cities are
crawling with crazies.
Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She
answers.
SARA
Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at
Irene's. I meant to leave you a
note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a
good idea. Let me check, hold on.
Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene.
SARA
(TO IRENE)
Do you like cats?
IRENE
Yeah, why?
SARA
We have to get rid of one.
IRENE
Can't. Travel too much. Poor
thing would starve to death.
61.
SARA
You're right.
(back into phone)
No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't
know... whenever I get there. Bye.
IRENE
Who was that?
SARA
My roommate. More than a little
overprotective.
IRENE
That's no fun.
SARA
So, where is it?
IRENE
What?
SARA
You said you had a surprise for me?
IRENE
Oh yeah. I went through my
closet. There's nothing here I've
worn in the past six months.
Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes.
SARA
You're kidding, all of these?! Oh
no.
IRENE
What ...what?
SARA
We have no closet space at the
dorms. Rebecca's already using
half of mine.
IRENE
Oh my God, I just had the best
idea.
SARA
What?
IRENE
Why don't you move in here with me?
62.
SARA
Seriously?
IRENE
Yeah, I'm never here. The place is
huge. Ditch the roommate. And,
the building allows pets.
SARA
Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about
it.
IRENE
Great.
(BEAT)
So, how's Jason? I really liked
him.
SARA
We broke up.
IRENE
Yeah ...he sucked.
Sara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet. The bags
spill out into the room, taking up floor space.
Rebecca sits on her bed, her laptop open. She's staring at
Irene's Facebook Profile. There are some racy pictures of
Irene and some girlfriends.
REBECCA
Hey. What're those?
SARA
Irene gave them to me. She had a
lot more but we don't have the
room.
REBECCA
Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles,
huh?
SARA
Well, maybe that's not a problem.
REBECCA
Really?
63.
SARA
Yeah. She actually suggested that
I move in with her.
REBECCA
What?
(BEAT)
You want to move?
SARA
No, of course not. I love living
here... with you.
Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a
bright spin on things.
SARA
Look, I'd still technically be
living here. So you wouldn't have
to get a new roommate. Her place is
huge and it's not like you couldn't
use the extra closet space. I'd
just move some of my stuff over,
and spend a few nights a week
there. We'd both have a lot more
space.
REBECCA
I don't want more space. I want...
She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence.
SARA
Nothing's set in stone. It's just
something to think about. Plus we'd
be able to keep Cuddles.
As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares
across the room at...
Cuddles.
Sara whips up a latte for a customer, her cell phone to her
ear. She's really got the hang of this job now. In charge,
moving with a purpose.
She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand
and points him toward the sink. He starts washing blenders.
SARA
(INTO PHONE)
Hey. I do so call, Mom. Geez.
Her latte customer rolls his eyes. Moms. He takes his drink
and walks away.
SARA
Well, actually, I was thinking I'd
do Thanksgiving here and see you
guys for Christmas.
She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what
she's hearing.
SARA
Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm
really getting slammed...
There isn't another customer in sight.
SARA
I'll call you later, okay? Tell
Dad I said hello. Bye.
She hangs up the phone and sighs.
Rebecca gathers her laundry into a giant duffle bag. As she
carries it toward the door, she passes Cuddles, curled up on
Sara's bed. She scoops her up.
REBECCA
Looks like it's just you and me
tonight.
Rebecca walks downstairs, down the hallway to the laundry
room.
66.
Rebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying. Cuddles plays
with a sock on top of a nearby washer.
Rebecca checks on her clothes. They're dry, with two minutes
still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her
duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles.
She pets her gently.
She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside.
REBECCA
(BABY TALK)
See how nice and warm it is in
there?
Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door
and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass.
She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the
dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and
gets back up.
Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time.
Cuddles stumbles. Flips over.
The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca,
wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her
last quarter. She gently places it in the slot.
ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the
glass at the kitten. She fingers the button.
Before she pushes it --
CUT TO:
Sara walks in to find Rebecca sprawled on her bed, crying.
She rushes over.
SARA
Hey, what's wrong?
Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed.
REBECCA
Cuddles got out.
67.
SARA
Oh no. In the dorm?
REBECCA
Outside.
SARA
What?!
REBECCA
I was doing laundry... I took her
with me... She jumped out of the
bag and ran outside. I went after
her, but...
(WHIMPERS)
I'm so sorry.
Sara stands, pissed. She wants to really go off on Rebecca...
but the girl's so distraught, so fragile.
SARA
Maybe she'll come back.
REBECCA
(EMPHATIC)
She won't.
SARA
I'm going to go find her.
REBECCA
Do you want me to help?
But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her.
Sara and Rebecca sit alone at a table. Eating quietly.
SARA
Maybe it's... just karma or
something. We weren't allowed to
keep her anyway.
REBECCA
You're not mad at me?
SARA
It was an accident.
(BEAT)
It's just... stress after stress,
you know?
68.
REBECCA
Is something else wrong?
A beat as Sara decides whether to confide.
SARA
My parents really want me to come
home for Thanksgiving.
REBECCA
You don't want to go?
SARA
It's not exactly the most festive
holiday in the Matthews household.
(BEAT)
Emily died two days before
Thanksgiving.
A beat. Rebecca pats Sara's hand.
SARA
I know I should be there with them,
but it's like there's a ghost at
the table.
REBECCA
You can come with me.
SARA
(THROWN)
What?
Rebecca sits up, her excitement growing.
REBECCA
Yeah, spend Thanksgiving at my
house.
SARA
Your folks wouldn't mind?
REBECCA
(LAUGHS)
Please. Like they'd even notice.
SARA
Okay, we'll see. Thanks.
69.
Professor Roberts stands at the blackboard, wrapping up a
lecture.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Your midterm designs are due
Friday. Remember, class:
Simplicity. Who founded our
industry? Eve -- when she handed
Adam that fig leaf.
Students laugh on their way out the door. As Sara walks past
Roberts...
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Sara. Could I see you in my office,
please?
SARA
(SURPRISED)
Sure. I've got a class right now.
But I'll come right after it.
Sara knocks on Professor Roberts' open door. She steps into
his office. It's small and intimate, with books stacked along
every wall. Scraps of fabric are pinned to cork boards.
Roberts smiles at her from his chair. He walks to the door
and closes it. He walks back, pulls a chair close to hers,
and sits down. She crosses her legs, her knees accidentally
brushing against his.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
I don't think I need to tell you
how impressed I've been with your
work.
(BEAT)
Every year I go to Fashion Week in
Paris. It's dazzling. The photo
shoots... the parties... that
incredible runway. When the first
model bursts through the curtain
and hits that catwalk? Sara, a roar
goes up from that crowd that's
like... nothing you've ever heard.
(BEAT)
The college allows me to take one
student. All expenses paid.
(MORE)
70.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT-D)
Full backstage access. Usually,
it's a senior.
(BEAT)
But it doesn't have to be.
Sara's pulse is racing.
SARA
I'm not sure I understand. Are you
saying what I think you're saying?
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
I'm saying you have a shot. You'd
have to earn it, Sara.
SARA
Of course. I'll do... anything.
Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the
quad... and now turns back to Sara.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
I'd like to see more danger in your
work. Your designs are always
crisp; they're always clear. But
they're a little... safe.
That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face.
Roberts walks over to her.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Don't be afraid to go to some of
the...
He delicately taps her temple.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT'D)
darker places in here.
SARA
Okay...
He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks
into her eyes.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
The best designers push the
boundaries of what's... acceptable.
They take chances. Do you like to
take chances, Sara?
SARA
Sometimes.
71.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
So do I.
He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her
chair. She stands in front of him, shaking.
SARA
I can't believe you just did that.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
I took a chance, that's all. With a
student that I trust.
SARA
I better go.
Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door...
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't
blow the chance of a lifetime.
She hurries out of the office.
Rebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops
down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables.
Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into
space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans
over, concerned.
REBECCA
What's wrong?
SARA
My design professor just kissed me.
Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next
to Sara.
REBECCA
Are you alright?
Sara nods.
SARA
Yeah, it just really creeped me
out. And I think the asshole's
married.
72.
Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's.
Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He
tosses some design sheets into his briefcase.
He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips
it onto his finger.
He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable
clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop
at his door.
Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He
walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the
bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him.
He opens the door, revealing:
Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black
jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her
shoulder.
Roberts swallows his surprise.
REBECCA
Professor Roberts?
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
That's right.
REBECCA
I'm glad I caught you.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Actually, I was just...
But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels
snapping on the worn hardwood floor.
Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her
back inside. They face each other.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
You're not one of my students.
REBECCA
Not yet. That's why I'm here.
73.
She steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner
is disarming. A beat.
REBECCA
I'm failing Intro Pysch.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
And why is that?
REBECCA
Because I'm bored. I thought it
would be all about Freud, and deep
dark secrets. But it's brain
chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay
awake in class.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not
sure what I can do to help.
REBECCA
Tomorrow's the last day to drop a
course without penalty. Unless I
can add another one in its place,
I'll fall way behind in credits.
Daddy won't take that very well. He
might even pull the plug. Which
means...
(BEAT)
I'm pretty much at your mercy,
Professor.
Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's
so calm, so steady. Roberts can't get a handle on her.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Look, I've always made it a policy
not to accept any students this
late in the term.
REBECCA
Do I look like just any student to
you?
She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty
feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus.
She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She
sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it
up.
REBECCA
Your wife is very pretty.
74.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Ex-wife .
The game is on now. Roberts slowly walks around the desk,
until he's behind Rebecca.
In the picture frame's reflection, Rebecca sees him slip off
his wedding ring. He palms it.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
A few things I'd need to know.
REBECCA
Ask me anything.
He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Do you have any design experience?
REBECCA
None.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
What do you know about clothes?
REBECCA
Only one thing.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
And what's that?
REBECCA
I definitely look better out of
them than in them.
What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in
close, between her parting legs. He looks into her eyes.
Still steady.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
I think we might be able to work
something out.
REBECCA
Great. Just tell me and I'll do
anything.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Kiss me.
(BEAT)
I'll take it from there.
75.
He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second,
and now gently pushes him away. He holds his ground. He's had
a taste -- he wants a lot more.
Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens.
REBECCA
Ow! You're hurting me! Professor,
stop!...
Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her.
What's going on? Rebecca smiles again.
This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her
eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her
again...
She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the
floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which
rolls away across the floor.
Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can
see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him.
REBECCA
Birthday gift. You should get one,
they're great.
She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few
seconds... and now hits the play button. We hear their prior
conversation, played back.
WALKMAN
Great. Just tell me and I'll do
anything.
(BEAT)
Kiss me. I'll take it from there.
(BEAT)
Owl You're hurting me! Professor,
stop!...
Rage and betrayal in Roberts' eyes.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
You bitch tease!
REBECCA
Oh, I'm not teasing.
She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the
floor.
76.
REBECCA
Do you see enough danger in me now,
Professor? Did I go to a dark
enough place for you?
He recognizes his own words to Sara.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
What? How did?... Who are you?
He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and
slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells
again.
REBECCA
She trusted you.
She walks toward the door.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS
Please don't do this. Twenty years.
Everything I worked for. I'll pay
for that tape.
Rebecca stops at the door. She kneels, picks up his wedding
ring, and rolls it across the floor to him.
REBECCA
Yes you will.
She walks out the door.
Sara sits on Stephen's bed. She is looking out the window,
holding a theory book in her hand.
Stephen watches her from his side of the bed.
STEPHEN
Anything wrong?
Sara is taken out of her own world
SARA
What?
STEPHEN
Are you ok?
SARA
Yeah, sure.
77.
She smiles. Stephen smiles back.
Sara looks down in her book again.
She walks slowly toward the classroom, letting other students
pass her. She steps into the doorway and sees...
A WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures
for everyone to come in. Sara, like the rest, is confused.
WOMAN
Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll
be taking over the class for the
rest of the semester.
Sara can't believe it. She takes a seat and turns to the
STUDENT next to her.
SARA
(WHISPERS)
What happened?
Sara walks in with a tray, still a bit dazed. She sees a half-
dozen hallmates milling about and Rebecca sitting by herself
in the corner, drawing. Sara joins her.
SARA
Remember what I told you about
Professor Roberts?
REBECCA
Yeah?
SARA
He's gone.
REBECCA
What do you mean?
78.
SARA
Well, they're calling it a leave of
absence. But what I heard... someone
sent the dean an anonymous
recording of him hitting on another
student.
REBECCA
Oh My God.
SARA
I know.
REBECCA
That's called Karma.
Sara serves up two fresh lattes... and now leans against the
counter to watch the band. Stephen's band. He catches her
looking at him. She smiles. Seriously smitten.
Stephen, sweaty, is behind the counter helping Sara clean up.
STEPHEN
I've made a decision. You ready?
SARA
Lemme hear it.
STEPHEN
I'm gonna quit the band.
SARA
No. Really? Why?
STEPHEN
It's a waste of time-and we suck.
SARA
Why would you say that?
STEPHEN
Well, let me think about this. The
only places we can get booked is at
my own frat house and at my
girlfriend's coffee shop.
79.
SARA
(SMIRKS)
You're right. You guys do suck.
A beat.
SARA
Hold it. Did you just say
girlfriend?
STEPHEN
You heard me.
SARA
So you think it'll be fun to stay
here during Thanksgiving?
STEPHEN
Dinner at the frat, the football
games. Don't forget the always
awkward, homoerotic humor.
SARA
Sounds like a blast.
STEPHEN
Oh. For sure.
A somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror
on the back of the front door. A very strange expression in
her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now...
Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly
knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin
is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot.
And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to
her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's
getting more and more numb to the blows.
She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and
grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large,
retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way
out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places
the knife against her skin and...
CUT TO:
80.
Sara opens the door and finds Rebecca curled up in a fetal
position in a corner of the room. Sobbing. Sara drops her
things and runs over to her.
SARA
Oh my God. What happened?
She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her
knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms.
SARA
Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe
now. Talk to me.
REBECCA
I was looking for Cuddles. A man...
pulled me into an alley. He
tried...
Sara holds her. She can't finish.
SARA
It's okay. It's okay. Shhh.
REBECCA
I got away.
SARA
You're alright now.
Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She
pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps.
Rebecca, newly showered, hair still wet, sits on her bed in
her underwear. Sara is tending to her wounds. Ice for the
bruises. Disinfectant for the cut. Rebecca flinches.
SARA
It's not deep, thank God. But you
should see a doctor.
REBECCA
No.
SARA
Rebecca, you need to. And then the
police.
81.
Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job.
REBECCA
I don't want to. I can't.
Sara pulls out her cell phone.
SARA
You're calling them, or I am.
There's a psycho walking around
this campus.
REBECCA
(CRYING AGAIN)
Please. I didn't see him.
She's so frazzled, she's undoing Sara's nursing efforts.
SARA
Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let
me help you.
Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently
as she works.
Sara looks down at her phone.
SARA
I haven't heard from Jason in
weeks. It's weird how he just
stopped calling.
REBECCA
It's what you wanted, right?
Sara nods, reassuring herself.
SARA
Yeah. Yeah it is.
Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile.
Rebecca and Sara walk in. Rebecca's on edge, flinching as
Sara closes the door.
Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room. Her father
gives her an awkward hug.
DAD
(SURPRISED)
We didn't think you would make it.
83.
Her mother sees the bruises on her face.
MOM
(ALARMED)
What happened?
REBECCA
Nothing.
DAD
Nothing? This isn't nothing.
REBECCA
(SNAPS)
Leave it alone.
Sara is stunned. But Rebecca's parents cease. Her mom gives
her a tender, protracted embrace. Rebecca endures it, barely
raising her arms.
DAD
Hello. And you are?
SARA
I'm Sara.
She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't
tell them?
REBECCA
Sara's my roommate.
DAD
(PLEASED)
I'm Jeff.
Rebecca's mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces Sara.
MOM
It's so great to meet you, Sara.
I'm Alison.
Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm.
REBECCA
Come on, let me show you my room.
Rebecca slams the door behind them, startling Sara.
84.
SARA
You didn't tell them we were
coming?
REBECCA
They didn't need to know.
Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a
typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just
drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage
girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one
teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.
SARA
These are interesting.
REBECCA
Yeah, some of my high school work.
I haven't gotten around to takin
them down.
Family and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large
dining table. The contents of the house are expensive but
not pretentious.
Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage
her parents, who are undaunted. All smiles and warmth.
SARA
Rebecca's a pretty great artist.
JEFF
Yeah, we think Rebecca is so
talented.
Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery.
SARA
She's an awesome roommate, too.
JEFF
(looks at his daughter,
POINTEDLY)
That's nice to hear and I'm sure
she likes you because she never
brings anyone home before.
Rebecca stares at her father.
85.
REBECCA
Dad!
JEFF
What? As a parent you worry. You
protect your daughter all her life
and then she goes off to college
and she's on her own. I'm just
relieved she got a good roommate.
Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these
people?
ALISON
Sara, I'll make up a room for you --
REBECCA
She'll stay in my room.
Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along.
Sara and Rebecca are getting ready to sleep. Sara has made a
makeshift bed in the middle of the floor.
REBECCA
We can share the bed if you want.
Sara looks down at her own "bed" and takes a glance at the
walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the
drawings of Rebecca looking at her.
SARA
Sure.
Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back.
Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed.
REBECCA
Thanks for coming.
SARA
Next Thanksgiving, you can run
interference with my family.
REBECCA
Done.
Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A
beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever
so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair.
86.
Sara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt
something. She closes them again.
Jeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen. He's
lived here long enough to know his way in the dark.
KITCHEN
Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates
Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father.
Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge.
JEFF
Becs. You scared me.
Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty
look. We know how much she hates nicknames.
Sara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from
downstairs. She climbs out of bed and walks to the door.
Sara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and
to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see...
Rebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the
moonlight through the window falling over them. Spooky.
JEFF
How're you doing?
REBECCA
Fine. My grades are good.
JEFF
That's not what I meant.
She looks down at the table.
87.
REBECCA
I'm making friends.
Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.
JEFF
Rebecca, look at me for a second.
Now she looks at him.
JEFF
Your mother and I are very fond of
you.
REBECCA
I know.
He doesn't know what else to say.
Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall.
Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the
beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile
happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.
JEFF
I just wanted to make sure. Good
night, I'm heading back to bed.
He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.
Sara waits by the front door. Alison walks in.
ALISON
Hi Sara.
SARA
Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some
of her high school hangouts.
ALISON
Wonderful.
Alison peers up the stairs.
ALISON
Rebecca seems to be doing well.
SARA
Uhhh, yeah. I think she is.
88.
ALISON
Is she taking her medication?
SARA
Medication?
Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs.
Did she hear them? She walks down.
ALISON
Hey sweetheart.
She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed.
REBECCA
(TO SARA)
Ready?
Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words.
Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully.
ALISON
Have a great time, you two.
Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE
CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca.
She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee.
89.
SARA
Thanks.
The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out.
What's she doing with Rebecca?
The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep
glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them
a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work.
REBECCA
(TO SARA)
I used to come here like every day
after school.
The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting.
One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks.
Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's
Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches.
The chatting girls all fall silent.
SARA
You know them?
REBECCA
They went to my high school.
SARA
Friends?
Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye
contact with the Brunette.
The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves.
Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance.
As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible.
The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances
at Rebecca as they order their drinks.
Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls.
Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette.
Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.
REBECCA
Let's leave.
Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her
things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table.
The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights.
90.
REBECCA
Hello, Maria.
MARIA
(WARY)
Hello.
The other girls walk over. Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over,
sending shivers down their spines. They want to back up their
friend, but they look as scared as she does. Sara watches all
this from a few feet away.
Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful.
REBECCA
Oh, I wanted to introduce you to
Sara. My roommate.
Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost
as if she feels sorry for her.
MARIA
Hi.
Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An
awkward beat. Everyone's tense. Sara clears her throat.
SARA
Well, we better go.
Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as
they open the door...
MARIA
Rebecca.
Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.
MARIA
We were never friends.
Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension
building. Maria doesn't back down, though. She needed to say
this. Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently.
SARA
Come on, let's go.
Headed back to school. Sara looks out the window. Lost in
thought.
91.
SARA
I guess college is a fresh start
for both of us.
Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement
on her face.
Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara
looks at the text message she just received from Irene:
"back in LA. lemme know abt movin in."
SARA
Irene's back in town.
Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.
Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in
the front door as a student walks out. She bypasses the
elevator, heading straight to the stairs.
She bursts out the door and into the hallway.
She walks in, still a bit out of breath. Rebecca is packing
her back-pack.
REBECCA
(not looking up)
Good run?
SARA
(between deep breaths)
Great. You wanna go get dinner?
REBECCA
I'm going to the art studio.
SARA
Oh. Okay. Catch you later then.
92.
REBECCA
Don't wait up, Sara...
(GRINS)
I feel inspired.
She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her
sketchpad behind on her bed. She eyes it for a beat. Looks at
the closed door.
As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in.
REBECCA
Forgot my pad.
She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's
dresser. But first... She walks to the door and opens it.
Sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the
empty hallway. She hears the elevator ding.
Sara heads straight for Rebecca's dresser. A beat. Is she
really going to do this? Yes. She slides open the top drawer:
Supplies. The second drawer: sketchpads. She leafs through
them: Empty.
She searches the third drawer: Sweaters. She feels around
beneath them. Wait a minute. She pulls out:
Two bottles of prescription medicine. "LITHIUM... For APD."
Both bottles are full of pills. As Sara stares at them...
A HAND TAPS HER SHOULDER.
She leaps out of her socks. But it's just Stephen.
STEPHEN
Your door was open.
SARA
Oh my God.
STEPHEN
Sorry.
Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her
tight and speaks, muffled by her neck.
93.
STEPHEN
What are those?
A beat. Should she bring him into this?
SARA
That's what I intend to find out.
Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her
drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a
pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She
looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train
comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around.
Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her
drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks
up and we see what she's been staring at:
Irene.
Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer.
Sara googles "Lithium and APD", and clicks on an entry.
SARA
(READING)
APD -- anti-social personality
disorder. Also known as sociopathy.
They look at each other.
STEPHEN
Jesus. I thought she was just
weird.
SARA
It says lithium can control the
condition.
(nodding at the bottles)
Maybe these are refills. Maybe
she's been taking it all along.
STEPHEN
Certainly doesn't seem like she's
been taking them.
He's right and she knows it. A beat.
94.
SARA
I think it's time I moved in with
Irene.
A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and
three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic
martinis and watching the dance floor.
And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by
herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around
her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca.
Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds
her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices
Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE
THAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS
IT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?
Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door
opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in.
Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene.
She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms.
Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her
in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and
smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find
Rebecca's in the mirror.
IRENE
I'm sorry to stare, but you are so
beautiful.
REBECCA SMILES
REBECCA
Thanks. So are you. Great lips.
What kind is it?
IRENE
It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl
never knows how late she's gonna
party.
Rebecca smiles. A beat.
95.
REBECCA
Can I try it?
Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and
pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips.
REBECCA
You're right... cinnamon.
Irene smiles.
This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's.
REBECCA
Why don't we get out of here. I'd
invite you to my place, but I have
a roommate.
IRENE
As luck would have it, I'm only two
blocks away and...no roommate.
REBECCA
What are we waiting for?
An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to
the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes
the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to
the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent
the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm..
IRENE
Shit.
She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table.
CUT TO:
Irene get's up with the empty glass in her hand. She
stumbles out into the...
HALLWAY.
She staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen.
We stay in the hallway as Irene enters in the kitchen and
switches on the light.
96.
We can see her shadow in the hallway and hear Irene fill her
glass. It's quiet for a moment. She drinks. She fills the
glass again.
Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She
switches off the light in the kitchen. But as she starts to
go back to her room ...WHAM!!
Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene.
CLOSE UP: GLASS EXPLODES ON THE FLOOR
Sara spots Irene's name on the buzzer and calls up. No
answer.
Sara, hands on hips, walks down the hallway and opens the
door.
She finds Rebecca, sitting on her bed. Drawing. She lights up
when she sees Sara.
REBECCA
Hey!
SARA
Hey yourself. Where were you all
night?
97.
REBECCA
Oh, I got inspired. I just lost
track of time.
Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper,
grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her
tattoo. Sara grabs a robe.
A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the
"big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.
SARA
REBECCA --
REBECCA
I want a tattoo.
(SARA'S SHOCKED)
Will you come with me?
SARA
Uhhh...
REBECCA
Please. It would mean a lot to me.
I won't be able to do it without
you.
Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them.
SARA
Um... sure. Okay.
The girls walk along the wall, checking out the samples.
SARA
You can't rush this, Rebecca. We
can always come back.
REBECCA
I know what I want.
SARA
Okay. I'm out here if you need me.
Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs.
She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone,
Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene.
98.
Sara, bored, leafs through a tattoo magazine for the 100th
time. Her phone buzzes. A response from Irene:
"outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )"
Sara's relieved.
STAIRS
Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara
puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up.
SARA
Let's see it.
Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just
under her collarbone:
"EMILY"
Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her.
REBECCA
(SWEETLY)
Think of me as your sister.
Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara.
REBECCA
If you want... you can call me
Emily.
Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves
toward Rebecca, whose grin fades.
REBECCA
What's the matter?
Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out
of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone.
Her eyes search Sara's for an answer.
Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches
her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back.
CUT TO:
99.
The elevator doors open. Sara, emotionally exhausted, steps
out, carrying a box of her things. Stephen waits by the door.
STEPHEN
This is all you're taking?
SARA
I'll get the rest of my things when
Irene comes back to town.
He takes the box. Then notices --
STEPHEN
Where's your necklace?
She instinctively rubs the base of her neck.
SARA
I can't find it. It's okay.
STEPHEN
Sara...
SARA
I'm not going back up there.
He hands her the box. Time to man up.
STEPHEN
Wait here. I'll go look for it.
She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative.
Rebecca still sits at the window. She holds her camera up,
taking a picture down below. She turns as Stephen enters.
She puts the camera down.
100.
STEPHEN
Have you seen Sara's necklace?
Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the
dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca
watches him.
REBECCA
What did I do?
He stops searching. Looks at her.
STEPHEN
She just needs to move on.
REBECCA
With you?
He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel
Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up.
STEPHEN
If you do find it, can you let me
know?
Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his
picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps
out of it and walks out the door.
She watches him go.
Sara is cleaning, trying to make a dent in a world-class
mess. She doesn't mind -- a big weight's off her shoulders.
STEPHEN
You should call someone. The dean's
office. Or at least your R.A.
She keeps cleaning.
SARA
And tell them what? What has she
really done to me? No one can do
anything.
(BEAT)
It's the weirdest thing, Stephen.
The girl's own parents are afraid
of her.
101.
STEPHEN
Well, she sure scared the shit out
of me.
Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of
his t-shirts.
SARA
Are these dirty or clean?
Stephen sniffs the shirts.
STEPHEN
Somewhere in between.
She throws the t-shirts at him.
Sara reaches Psi U. and closes the door behind her. She looks
around at the messy first floor. At the PACK OF GUYS in the
living room, yelling at the hoops game on TV.
Sara smiles. She's safe.
Rebecca is alone, with just a crack of light coming from the
open door to the hallway. She's sketching, still wearing her
Walkman. Hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the
floor, but we can't see what she's drawing.
Sara is trying to study at a cramped desk but the music from
outside the room is too loud. Stephen is on the bed,
reading. He's used to it. She hears a loud commotion from
the hallway. Frustrated, she gets up.
It's a couple of guys playing nerf basketball.
SARA
Seriously. Is it a game to be as
loud as you possibly can?
She waves her arms like a crazy person.
SARA (CONT'D)
How many walls can you possibly
bump into!?
They just return blank stares. She slams the door shut.
Sara tries to study while the fraternity brothers continue to
shout down the hall. Stephen eyes her warily. Her cellphone
rings. She pulls it out of the purse: Jason.
103.
She hesitates... and now stuffs the phone back in her bag as
she gets up from the table.
SARA
Hey, I'm going to hit the library.
STEPHEN
(GETTING UP)
I can walk you there.
SARA
No, it's okay.
STEPHEN
Party starts at ten. Really cool
band...
SARA
I hear the drummer's really hot.
STEPHEN
He may be, but I'm sleeping with
his girlfriend...
She kisses him.
Rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser. Opens the bottom
drawer. Her sweaters. She fishes underneath them. Pulls out
her lithium pills. But just looks at them. Anger in her eyes.
She puts the bottle back.
104.
Jason walks through the hallway, checking the numbers on the
doors. He stops in front of Sara's room. Knocks lightly on
the door. No answer. Knocks again.
Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door,
ignoring the knocks. Almost catatonic.
Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest,
shredding it to pieces.
Jason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the
door. He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right
thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the
elevator.
Rebecca stares at the note for a moment. She walks to the
door, picks it up and begins to read Jason's note.
SARA -
I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want
to see you. I'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until...
however long it takes. Please.
Love,
JASON
Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash.
Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her
fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water
trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain.
105.
Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her
reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long
pair of shears. Her "Emily" tattoo is starting to heal. She
gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears,
still looking at it in the mirror.
She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.
Just above her shoulders.
Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs
through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls
out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in
front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing.
Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain.
Which she caresses in her hand.
Sara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book.
Enjoying the silence.
A raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just
finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage. A HOT
GIRL smiles at him.
GIRL
Help me find the keg?
STEPHEN
Sure, I have to go look for my
girlfriend anyway.
She walks away. "Jerk". He grins... and now checks his watch.
Where's Sara?
The elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca. Or is it Sara?
The hair. The dress. The tattoo. Rebecca looks just like her.
106.
As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the
necklace. She walks along, looking at the room numbers.
She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she
sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an
open room.
She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now
plucks the master key card off the cart.
Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed.
The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for
a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason
barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep.
Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares
down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the
floor. She's in just bra and panties now.
She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake.
JASON
WHA--
REBECCA
Shhhh.
She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts
kissing the back of his neck.
JASON
Sara?
(BEAT)
You got my voicemail.
REBECCA
Mm-hmmm.
Kissing his back now, moving lower.
JASON
Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good.
She works her way back up to his ear.
REBECCA
(WHISPERING)
Turn over.
107.
Did that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees...
The hair. The necklace. That unmistakable "Emily" tattoo.
REBECCA
(WHISPERING)
Close your eyes.
He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she
needs to. She settles onto him. And now starts to move.
And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low
light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap. Flat against
the skin of her back.
Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut.
JASON
I love you, Sara.
She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her
hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife.
REBECCA
But she doesn't love you.
Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those
aren't Sara's eyes boring into his.
Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in
shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the
knife deep into his gut. He gasps.
REBECCA
You hurt her.
She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel. He
shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open.
Sara's still reading. A hand touches her shoulder. She jumps,
but it's just the LIBRARIAN.
LIBRARIAN
We're about to close.
Sara can't believe it's so late. She puts her things away.
Grabs her phone to check the time, distracted by the "1 new
voicemail" message. She's about to press the voicemail
button...
But a text comes in from Irene:
108.
"Im back. Get your butt over here, I've got another surprise
for you."
Stephen walks around, beer-less, searching the crowd for
Sara. He checks his watch. Pats his pocket -- no cell phone.
He heads up the stairs and into his room.
Stephen picks his phone off the dresser. Sees he has a new
voicemail from Sara. He plays the message
SARA (V.0.)
Hi Stephen, it's me. I'm stopping
by Irene's, come on by. I want you
guys to meet ...it's on 524 South
Grand, Apt. 708. Love you.
He groans. A sharp knock, and the bedroom door opens.
FRAT BOY
All hands on deck -- the keg's
still alive.
Sara rides up the elevator.
Sara walks to the door of Irene's apartment. It's open but
there's not a sound. No music, no cocktail chatter.
She checks the apartment number again. It's the right one.
She knocks lightly. No answer.
SARA
Irene?
Sara steps into the foyer.
109.
She walks down the long entryway into a newly-renovated
living room. Dark and empty. Sara's starting to feel uneasy.
SARA
Irene?
There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She
slowly walks to the open door... looks in... and freezes.
CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees.
The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above...
Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a
bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth.
Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock.
SARA
(WHISPERING)
Irene.
Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror. As Sara starts
toward Irene...
REBECCA (O.S.)
Some role model she turned out to
be. Couldn't even take care of
herself.
Rebecca steps out of the darkness, a gun in her hand. Sara
drops her phone on the floor.
SARA
Rebecca!
Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara.
REBECCA
Sit down and shut up.
Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene.
Rebecca picks up Sara's cell phone.
REBECCA
Listen to me. All I ever wanted
was to be your friend.
A beat. Sara knows she has to play this just right.
SARA
Rebecca, you are my friend.
110.
REBECCA
No. Shut up. We're not friends.
We're here because you betrayed me.
SARA
Rebecca, I'm sorry--
REBECCA
Stop it. Stop saying things you
don't mean. I protected you.
From that whore Tracy and that
nasty little kitten... and That
scumbag of a professor...
(BEAT)
Even that loser ex-boyfriend of
yours.
SARA
What're you talking about? What'd
you do to them? What'd you do to
Jason?
REBECCA
I got rid of them all. And how do
you repay me? By leaving me.
Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment.
She looks at Irene.
Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in
the eye. She puts everything she has into this.
SARA
Rebecca, please forgive me.
A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up.
REBECCA
Now we can start all over again.
Let's make things the way they
were, Sara. That first day. Just
the two of us.
Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands.
SARA
Rebecca...
REBECCA
After all... you can only have one
best friend.
SARA
No! Don't!
Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to
buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her...
REBECCA
Lay still bitch.
SARA
Please. Don't do this...
Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die.
She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun.
REBECCA
Stop! I mean it.
Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming.
Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across
the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor.
She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair
from Sara's face.
REBECCA
(GENTLE)
Shh... I'm so sorry.
Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It
skitters across the floor and out the door into the living
room.
Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs
Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a
chokehold.
Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the
chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again.
Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip.
She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara
rises...
Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of
her. As Sara gasps for breath...
Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun.
Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it.
Rebecca turns around and goes for the door.
112.
Sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's
head.
IRENE'S EYES POP OPEN. Huge relief in Sara's face. But...
Rebecca bangs the door.
REBECCA (O.S.)
Don't do this Sara!
Sara takes the scarf out of Irene's mouth and pulls against
the steel handcuffs. Useless.
Rebecca wipes blood off her lip and leans up to the door.
REBECCA
Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I
just want to be your friend.
Sara and Irene are frantic.
IRENE
My phone. My phone.
She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table.
She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut!
SARA
Shit!
IRENE
The window! There's a fire escape.
You can reach it.
Rebecca looks around for the gun. Throwing chairs and
furniture around. She finds it.
Picks the gun off the floor.
Sara races to the window and throws it open. There's just an
empty street below. She eyes the fire escape. A nearly
impossible leap away. But Sara's out of options.
113.
Rebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires.
BLAM!
The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead
and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head. Feathers
go flying. Irene screams.
Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.
REBECCA
I know you're scared, Sara. But I
promise, everything is gonna be
okay.
She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge.
Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in
Irene's eyes.
REBECCA
Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend,
not yours.
She raises the gun at the helpless Irene...
But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks
her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet...
Rebecca fires another shot, hitting a giant bedroom mirror,
shattering it's reflection of Rebecca's struggle with
Stephen.
Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward.
He keeps hold of her, and they hit the floor, the gun flying
out of Rebecca's hand.
Stephen gets on top. He lifts his arm high and balls his fist
before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking
her out cold.
He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he
races for the window.
SARA (O.S.)
(SCREAMING)
Stephen! Help!
IRENE
Hurry!!
He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.
Sara opens the door. The simple room is identical to her
previous one. She hesitates at first but then walks in.
There is a box marked "SARA" filled with the things she left
behind in her old dorm. There's a knock on the open door.
STEPHEN (O.S.)
Welcome back.
SARA
Hey. How are you feeling?
Stephen enters the room.
STEPHEN
Better now. You being here's gonna
help.
Sara smiles.
STEPHEN (CONT'D)
How's moving in going?
SARA
Just got here.
STEPHEN
Well let me give you some time to
get settled in.
SARA
Actually, I need you right here,
right now.
Stephen grins. He likes where this is headed.
STEPHEN
Okay.
CUT TO:
Sara and Stephen push the twin bed into the hallway.
118.
STEPHEN
This isn't exactly what I had in
mind.
Sara grins.
SARA
Now I can get settled in.
STEPHEN
I'll be back to pick you up for
dinner. You gonna be ready?
SARA
Absolutely.
Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her
eyes before she goes back into her room.
Sara sits down on her bed. She watches the empty space where
the other bed used to be. She just stares at it. The camera
slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf
where unseen by Sara, there's a flyer hung with a picture of
Richard Prince's Nurse of Greenmeadow announcing an upcoming
gallery exhibition.
CUT TO BLACK.
