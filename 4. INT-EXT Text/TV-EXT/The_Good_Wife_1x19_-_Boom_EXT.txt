    An old brick building.  We can see the blackened exterior 
      from an explosion six months old.   

                                  CLAY (V.O.)
                    My great-grandfather, Lucius Clay, 
                    founded the Vindicator.


      A downtown building under construction.  Golden and Gold ride 
    up in a construction lift with Gerald Kozko.  The lift stops 
    on a floor and they exit.  Golden doing all the talking; Eli 
      doing all the watching.  

                                  KOZKO
                    So... how s Peter holding up?

                                  GOLDEN
                    He s good.  He would be better if 
                    he had a clearer sense of what 
                    Childs was planning. 

                                  KOZKO
                    So he got the message?  My apology? 

                                  GOLDEN
                    You and Peter go back a long way.  
                    If Childs is threatening you-- 
                    naturally Peter wants to help his 
                    friends in any way he can.

                                  KOZKO
                    I don t want to hurt Peter.  But 
                    it s not just me.  I have a legacy 
                    to protect.  My son.

    He nods across the floor to ANTHONY KOZKO (late 20s) in 
      managerial hard-hat.  Good looking kid.  

                                  GOLDEN
                    Peter has a family too.

                                  KOZKO
                    We all have families.   

    Eli stares at him, finally... 

                                  ELI
                    Okay, pleasantries over.  Whatever 
                    you ve got, or can devise, to hurt 
                    Peter-- he s got twice as much to 
                    hurt you.

                                  KOZKO
                    I know your reputation, Mr. Gold.

                                  ELI
                    Then you know I don t screw around.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      24.

                                  KOZKO
                    I know Peter has religion.  

    Eli pauses, surprised.

                                  ELI
                    Meaning?

                                  KOZKO
                    He s off his game.  You have some 
                    pastor giving him spiritual 
                    instruction.  And now he s going to 
                    church.  Hey, I m in risk 
                      assessment, Mr. Gold.  At the 
                    moment, Childs is the bigger risk.

                                  GOLDEN
                    Did he give you immunity?

      Kozko just stares at them.  Then goes off to join his son.  
    Eli and Golden frown.

                                  ELI
                    That s not good.  


    The sun s starting to set as Alicia and Kalinda approach the 
      door of a well-kept suburban home.  Kalinda knocks.  

                                  KALINDA
                    We don t threaten with a subpoena 
                    unless he refuses to testify.

                                  ALICIA
                    How about if we don t threaten at 
                    all?

    The door opens, revealing a friendly-looking Middle Eastern 
      woman.  DR. BASSIR.  40 s, very well dressed, western.

                                  DR. BASSIR
                    Yes?

      Another shot of the newspaper offices--


      Alicia and Kalinda download their findings to Will and Diane.

                                  KALINDA
                    The blast blew apart the wall with 
                    the dumbwaiter, so there was no 
                    evidence it was even there.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Should I bring Julius in on this?

                                  WILL
                    No, not yet.  We ll update him later.  
                          (Alicia stares at him: odd)
                    I still don t understand how the 
                    Fedsmissed this-- 

                                  KALINDA
                    My guess is they didn t.  Their 
                      investigation is still open-- they 
                    just haven t issued any findings 
                    yet.  And they won t, until they 
                    catch whoever s responsible.

      Will, seeing Cary in the hall, opens the door: 

                                  WILL
                    Cary, come on in.

      Alicia notes this.  Not sure what to make of it.  

                                  DIANE
                    The question is, what does it mean?

                                  ALICIA
                    Stern s theory is that Clay wanted 
                    a violent backlash.  That rests on 
                    the fact that he cut back security.  

                                  KALINDA
                    But if the bomb came from inside-- 
                    no security could ve prevented it.

                                  ALICIA
                    Right.

                                  DIANE
                    Stern will argue the bomb was still 
                    planted by a radical Islamic group-- 
                    they just had help from inside.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      39.

                    So talk to the employees.  

      Diane and Will consider it.

                    It could help.  A lone bomber in the

                    So we re going to racially profile?  The 
                    exact thing the cartoon was against.

                                  WILL
                    No, we re going to step nicely past 
                    the ironies and defend our client.

                          (smiles; to Kalinda)
                    Go over the employees-- all of 
                    them.  But concentrate on the 
                    Muslim and Middle Eastern employees 
                    for the last five years.  Okay?

      Kalinda nods, goes, as Diane sees Julius leaving the 
      conference room.  Asks Will:  

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Shall we? 

    Oh.  Will sees Julius too.  Nods.  He and Diane exit as Cary 
    and Alicia watch, see the two gesture to Julius, escort him 
      into Diane s office.  

                                  ALICIA
                    What s that about?

      Cary shrugs maybe a little too big, and exits too.  Alicia 
      just stands there, alone.  What s going on?  


      Clay on the stand.  Alicia mid-questioning--

                                  ALICIA
                    Mrs. Sanborn stated under oath that  
                    it was your decision to have the 
                    cartoon depict the prophet Muhammad.

                    That s untrue.  The cartoonist 
                    contacted me with that idea.  

      Alicia shoots a look toward Karen Sanborn in the gallery.  
      Clearly hurting her.

                                  ALICIA
                    Still it was your decision to run 
                    the cartoon, Mr. Clay.  Why did you?  

                                  CLAY
                    Because it was newsworthy.  It 
                    wasn t sensational.  And-- this is 
                    America; we can handle it.

      Alicia takes a beat, then heads toward her seat-- no further 
      questions-- as Mr. Stern passes, and winks at her.  He loves 
      this.  Turns to Clay...

                    The bomb was raised up through one 
                    of the dumbwaiters in your office--

                                  ALICIA
                      Objection-- again, not in evidence.

                                  STERN
                          (peeved)
                    It s in the investigative report--

                                  ALICIA
                    The investigative report merely 
                    states that it appears the bomb was 
                    planted from inside.  It doesn t 
                    say anything specifically about 
                    dumbwaiters.  We ask that statement 
                    be stricken from the record--

                                  JUDGE GARRETT
                    Is that really necessary, Mrs. 
                    Florrick?  Overruled.

      Diane shoots Alicia a look-- what the hell are you doing?  
    But Alicia ignores her as she sits back down.  

      Stern tries to gather himself, but it s becoming clear what s 
      happening: Alicia s objections are throwing him off his game.

                                  STERN
                    Thank you.  I-- where was I?

      Rachel, Stern s associate, glances up at him-- should she say 
      something?  Stern stands there a second, then--

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    Right.  The dumbwaiter-- employees.  
                    Mr. Clay-- did any of your 
                    employees ever come to you with any 
                    threats they d received regarding--

                                  ALICIA
                      Objection-- overly vague.

                                  JUDGE GARRETT
                    Mrs. Florrick-- 

                                  ALICIA
                    You re right.  Withdrawn, your Honor.

      Judge Garrett stares at her.  So does Diane.  But Stern is 
    now genuinely confused.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #118   "Boom"   GREEN COLLATED   4/1/10      49.

                                  JUDGE GARRETT
                    You may proceed, Mr. Stern.

                                  STERN
                    Yes, your Honor.  I-- just a moment--

    He goes back to the plaintiff s table, shuffles through 
      papers-- clearly trying to jog his memory.  

                                  JUDGE GARRETT
                    Mr. Stern?

                                  STERN
                    Just a moment, your Honor--

      Alicia looks over at him as Rachel leans in, whispers--

                                  RACHEL
                    Inside job.  The threat, the 
                    document that--

                                  STERN
                    Quiet.

                                  JUDGE GARRETT
                    Mr. Stern, do you have any further 
                    questions for this witness?

                                  STERN
                    Dammit, give me a minute!

      A stunned silence in the courtroom.  

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    I m-- sorry, your Honor.  I was-- 
                    I m just--

      Stern hesitates, now totally lost.  And finally:

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    I have-- I have nothing further.

      Alicia keeps her poker face, staring straight ahead.  As 
      Stern looks over at her, a dawning realization.  Alicia 
      doesn t look at him.

      Russell Thiessen is back on the stand. Cary stands to 
      question, taking his time, shooting a smile toward Rachel 
      Wiley as he passes.  She just frowns a  fuck you  look back.  

                                  CARY
                    Mr. Thiessen, you covered the 
                    bombing at the Oak Lawn synagogue?

                                  THIESSEN
                    That s right.

                    And it s your opinion that this 
                    bomb was very similar to that one?

                                  THIESSEN
                    Identical.

                                  CARY
                    In what ways, exactly?

      Stern studies Cary-- what s he up to? 

                                  THIESSEN
                    Well, in both cases the device was 
                    fashioned from a metal cannister, densely 
                    packed with hydrazine nitrate explosive 
                    and a simple remote-triggered circuit.  

                                  CARY
                    I see.  But this utilized a 
                    different triggering mechanism than 
                    the synagogue bombing?

                                  THIESSEN
                    No, no-- it was identical. 

                                  CARY
                    A modified flashbulb?

                                  THIESSEN
                    Yes, from a camera-- it s quite 
                    clever.  It produces just enough 
                    flame to trigger the fuse.

                                  CARY
                    Interesting.  But when you reported 
                    on the synagogue bombing-- you 
                    never mentioned that fact?

                                  THIESSEN
                    Well, it s kind of a technical 
                    detail.  A little beyond the scope 
                    of a basic news article.

                                  CARY
                    Of course.  It s just... whoever 
                    planted the bomb at the Vindicatorhad 
                    to know the layout of the building, 
                    the dumbwaiters, Mr. Sanborn s 
                    schedule, and how to build a bomb 
                    exactly like the Defenders of Allah s.

                          (a growing realization)
                    Objection, your honor!

                                  JUDGE GARRETT
                    Objection?  There hasn t been a 
                    question yet.  Overruled.

      Cary grins at Rachel.  Stern sighs, seeing the writing on the 
      wall.  He scribbles something on a piece of paper, as--

                                  CARY
                    And if you never reported on the 
                    triggering mechanism, Mr. Thiessen, 
                    then the only person I can think of 
                    who possesses all of that knowledge-
                    - would be you.

      Alicia looks toward the jury, sees them furiously taking 
      notes.  So does Rachel.  As Stern reaches across the aisle 
      with the piece of paper.  Diane looks toward him, takes it.

                                  RACHEL
                    Objection, your Honor!  This is 
                    completely without basis-- 

                                  JUDGE GARRETT
                    Yes, I m afraid you re right.  I 
                    have to sustain that objection.  

      Diane opens it, reads:   $350k.   She considers.  Scratches 
    out the number, writes in  $250k.   She offers it back.

                                  CARY
                          (watching Stern and Diane)
                    That s okay, your honor.  I have 
                    nothing further.

    And Cary returns to his seat, passing Stern and Rachel.  Both 
      trying to hold a poker face, staring straight ahead, as Stern 
      reads the amount.  Both crushed, as... Choir singing gets 
      louder and louder, and we find ourselves in...


      ...Alicia steps out of the church, sees Kozko coming up the 
      basement stairs, trying to save the remnants of his ripped 
      shirt, rushing off to his car, worried.  And as Alicia s 
      trying to process this, she sees...

      ...Peter coming up.  She locks eyes with him, studying him.  
      Without a word, Alicia heads back into Church.
