To establish.  A formidable castle.  CHURCH BELLS are ringing.

SUPER TITLE:   MILAN - FOUR DAYS EARLIER 



Sforza, having rallied and dressed in his finery, hurries to 
the Gothic church with Cicco and his BODYGUARDS in tow.



We are at the edge of dramatic cliff overlooking Florence.  
It is windy and HAWKS can be seen riding the thermals. 

VANESSA (O.S.)
Tell me a secret, Leonardo.

ANGLE ON LEONARDO DAVINCI 

Tall, handsome, stylish, with an insatiable curiosity.  At 
the moment, he is SKETCHING someone with his RIGHT HAND --

VANESSA (19), a buxom beauty, WHO POSES NAKED on a rock.  Her 
hair is braided with ribbons and blows in the wind.  Behind 
them is a wagon containing a LARGE OBJECT beneath a tarp.  

VANESSA (CONT D)
What was your earliest memory?  Or 
better yet, your greatest fear?

DaVinci checks an HOURGLASS beside him.  He reaches for a 
glass of wine with his RIGHT HAND, then starts a NEW SKETCH 
of Vanessa with his LEFT HAND.  5.


DAVINCI
In my case, the two go hand in hand.  
I was six months old.  

VANESSA
No one remembers back that far.

DAVINCI
I am unique in that regard.  My 
mother put me in a cradle out in 
the field.  She left me for a 
moment and a hawk flew down.  It 
perched there, looking at me.  
Almost as if it were trying to 
reveal some kind of mystery.     

VANESSA
Regarding what?

DAVINCI
I never found out.  My mother threw 
a stone at the bird and drove it 
away.  Yet as clear as that memory 
is; the one aspect I can never 
properly recall is my mother s face.
(a stark confession)
I can draw anything I ve seen, even in 
passing.  But when it comes to my 
mother, all I see is a void.  

VANESSA
Surely you ve seen her since --

DAVINCI
No.  She disappeared that night.  
And I ve been trying to recall her 
face ever since.

VANESSA
Well, if that s your innermost 
secret, you re not so unique.  All 
men are searching for their 
mothers.  That s what guides you 
between our thighs.

DAVINCI
I pay you to pose, Vanessa.  Not 
plumb the depths of my character.

VANESSA
Yes, well, my particular brand of 
posing comes with a surcharge of 
pillow talk.  So tell me -- is 
there nothing else you fear?6.


DAVINCI
Only imperfection, Sister.

DaVinci eyes his sketch.  Though it s a perfect likeness, he 
CRUMPLES it up.  For he is plagued by the knowledge that much 
of what he conceives will never be properly executed.  Then:

NICO (O.S.)
Maestro!

A breathless twelve year-old crests the path behind them.  
This is NICO MACHIAVELLI, DaVinci s exuberant apprentice.  
DaVinci glances at his hourglass.  The sands have all fallen.

DAVINCI
You re late, Nico.

NICO
What?  You re the one that s late.  
Verrocchio s been looking 
everywhere for you --

DAVINCI
As are my creditors and the shopkeep 
from whom I liberated this chianti.  
They can wait.  We ve an experiment 
to conduct and you re meant to play 
a principle role in it.  Come --

But Nico is frozen, staring at Vanessa s naked form.  

VANESSA
Hello.

DAVINCI
They re called breasts, Nico.  
Every woman possesses them.  

DaVinci heads for the wagon, tugging Nico along.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Vanessa s on loan to me from the 
Santa Maria convent.  I needed 
someone to do light studies on.  

NICO
Did the Abbess know she d --

DAVINCI
-- have her generous mounds 
flapping about in the wind?  No.  
Nor does she know that her charge s 
virginity is no longer, in the 
strictest legal sense, intact.  
(MORE)7.

DAVINCI (CONT'D)
But who will tell her?  Help me 
with these ropes.

DaVinci unties the canvas shroud, and with Nico s help, 
quickly pulls it from the wagon bed, revealing --

A LARGE, BAT-WINGED  KITE ,

Constructed of linen stretched on a wooden frame.  
Essentially, a Renaissance hang-glider.  The kite is attached 
via rope to a hand-cranked drum mounted onto the wagon bed.  

DAVINCI (CONT D)
How much do you weigh, Nico?  About 
ninety-four pounds?

Nico eyes the device with growing unease.

NICO
Ninety-six, I think.

DAVINCI
Close enough.  Climb into that 
harness, would you?

Nico reluctantly climbs up and begins harnessing himself in.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Today, we are attempting to 
ascertain whether or not this kite 
can provide the necessary wind-
resistance to support your weight.

NICO
What if it can t?

DAVINCI
Then your noble sacrifice will amend 
Aristotle s treatise on gravity.
(calling to Vanessa)
Vanessa, would you mind prancing 
about for a moment?

Vanessa complies, happily pirouetting about as the wind whips 
her beribboned hair to and fro.  DaVinci seems pleased.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
You see, Nico?  Those weighted 
ribbons allow me to calculate the 
strength and direction of the wind --
(squinting as he thinks)
In this case, I d say about twenty 
knots, and shifting westerly, which 
will require a slight adjustment --8.


DaVinci SLAPS the horse, guiding the wagon towards the cliff.  

NICO
Wait, WAIT!  What if your 
calculations are wrong?

A GUST OF WIND catches the kite s  wings , lifting Nico from 
the wagon.  He SCREAMS and the rope begins uncoiling.  
DaVinci cranks the drum.  The kite rises thirty feet.  

VANESSA
You re flying, Nico!

But now, the drum is spinning so fast that DaVinci can t keep 
up with it.  Worse, friction is creating WISPS OF SMOKE.

Alarmed, DaVinci activates a HAND-BRAKE, but the device FAILS 
He looks about the wagon, forced to improvise.  Then he 
seizes a SWORD and DRIVES it cross-wise through the drum.  

The rope stops unspooling.  With an effort, DaVinci reels Nico 
back in.  Once Nico is safely back in the wagon, he quickly 
unbuckles himself.  DaVinci claps him on the shoulder.

DAVINCI
Welcome back to terra firma, Nico!

Nico smiles, feeling faint.  DaVinci sniffs the air, then 
looks to Nico s crotch.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
It would appear you pissed yourself 
while you were aloft, Nico.

Nico looks down.  Indeed, he has.  He looks up, embarrassed.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
No worries.  I brought an extra 
pair of leggings just in case.

DaVinci reaches into the wagon, producing a pair of leggings.  
He tosses them at Nico, then smiles at Vanessa.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Shall we be off, then, Sister?



DaVinci and Nico lead the horse-drawn wagon through the 
chaotic streets.  There are VENDORS hawking their wares from 
stalls.  BEGGARS, GUILDSMEN, MERCHANTS riding donkeys.  9.


ON THE DOCKS AT THE ARNO RIVER,

A ship has come in.  VISITORS from foreign lands disembark, 
including a tall, TURKISH MAN (50s), shrouded in a blue robe.

Nico takes it all in, wide-eyed, frequently dodging around 
obstacles.  Just then, a STRAY PIG races by, knocking him on 
his ass.  As he sits, he notices that he s fallen in shit.

NICO
God I hate this place --

DAVINCI
Where else could we practice our 
flights but in Florence?  

DaVinci helps Nico up.  They keep moving.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Any other city, we d be burnt at the 
stake for our efforts.  But here?  
I m just another free-thinking 
heretic amongst the whores and 
reprobates.  Chaos, culture, it s 
all celebrated within these walls.  
Florence only demands one thing of 
its people; to be truly awake.
(stopping in mid-stride)
Like that angelic vision.  I d pay 
good money to disturb her slumber -- 

ANGLE ON LUCREZIA DONATI (20S),

Trailed by a coterie of SERVANTS clutching bundles of 
flowers.  Lucrezia is stunning.  

NICO
Keep walking, Maestro.  That s 
Lucrezia Donati.  
(off DaVinci s look)
Lorenzo Medici s mistress?  He ll 
break you on the wheel if he so 
much as catches you looking at her.

DaVinci keeps gazing at her, smitten.  And then, for an 
instance, Lucrezia s eyes connect with his.  He LAUGHS.

DAVINCI
What if she s caught looking at me?

Just then, a COMMOTION draws their attention as a MERCENARY, 
bearing a BLUE SERPENT on his surcoat, GALLOPS by them, his 
horse in a frenzied lather.  The mercenary reins in his steed 
just in front of the Medici Palace.10.


DAVINCI (CONT D)
(his brow furrowing)
Bad tidings from Milan, Nico.

NICO
How can you tell?

DAVINCI
That serpent on the rider s surcoat 
is the Biscione, the Sforza family 
emblem.  If he was bringing good 
news, he would have dressed in the 
more traditional red and white 
shield of Milan.
(pondering)
No, whatever the message is, Lorenzo 
won t be happy with it.



A bottega with opening onto the busy street.  CHILDREN scamper 
outside as dogs, pigs, and chickens wander freely about.



A memory.  The sun is high.  A younger Da Vinci (16), climbs 
a hillside, attempting to round up some wayward SHEEP.

Then he notices a waterfall.  And behind it, a CLEFT in the 
rock.  Curious, he climbs up, where he discovers a CAVE.    
He peers into the darkness.  A wind from within stirs his 
hair.  Setting caution aside, he climbs inside.  

Time passes.  Shadows lengthen and the sun dips.  Then --

YOUNG DAVINCI EMERGES

His clothes are torn and his hands are covered with BLOOD.  
He tries to wipe them on his clothes, but there s too much of 
it.  The boy starts to panic, CRYING OUT, his screams --



-- wooden cages, containing every kind of BIRD imaginable, 
from fowl to songbirds to birds of prey.

REVEAL DaVinci and Nico, browsing the BIRD SELLERS section.  
DaVinci at a CAGE OF STARLINGS, nodding to the PROPRIETOR:

DAVINCI
How much for the starlings?

BIRD SELLER
Six denari a-piece.

DAVINCI
You ll take two soldi for the whole 
cage and be happy about it.  

BIRD SELLER
Two -- are you trying to offend me?!

DAVINCI
If I wanted to offend you, I d 
comment on the scent of fecal matter 
wafting from your hind quarters.  Do 
you want the soldi or not?  They re 
my last and I m getting bored.

DaVinci reaches into his belt purse, producing the soldi.  
The vendor offers him the cage, but DaVinci shakes his head.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
I m only interested in the birds.  
Just open the cage on my say-so.  

DaVinci opens his notebook, pulling out a sketch pencil that.23.


NICO
(explaining to the vendor)
He s obsessed with flight.  He 
studies them for inspiration.  

DaVinci nods to the vendor, who opens the cage.  

The starlings take to the air in slow-motion and we shift 
into  DA VINCI VISION .  A kind of wire-frame overlay appears 
atop the birds, outlining the MECHANICS of their flight.  For 
this is another of Da Vinci s gifts; the ability to perceive 
the inner workings of virtually any mechanism.

DaVinci records every detail, quickly rendering a series of 
perfect studies.  And then, the spell is broken as --

BIRD SELLER
Well?  Did you see what you were 
hoping to?

DAVINCI
For one of my soldis back, I just 
might tell you.

DaVinci leaves the vendor, his attention now drawn to --

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Look, Nico.  There she is again --

LUCREZIA DONATI,

Again making her rounds with her servants.  As we watch, her 
group encounters another, exchanging pleasantries with --

LORENZO MEDICI,

Holding court, surrounded by FAVOR SEEKERS and BODYGUARDS.  

NICO
And there s Lorenzo Medici, too.  
You d best keep moving.

Nico tugs at his sleeve, but DaVinci stays put, watching --

DAVINCI
Look at them, both behaving with 
perfect composure.  Surrounded by 
parasites.  Everyone pretending the 
two of them aren t fucking.

NICO
Isn t that your father with them?24.


As Nico points out PIERO DAVINCI (50s), a serious-minded man 
in robes, DaVinci s face clouds over with a storm of emotions.

DAVINCI
The Crown Prince of parasites.  He 
serves as Lorenzo s notary.  
(then, impulsively)
Let s stir the pot a little, Nico.

As DaVinci stalks towards the group, Piero spots him, his 
mouth curling into a frown.  The bodyguards stiffen, alert 
for trouble.  But DaVinci ignores them, grinning broadly.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Your Magnificence!

Lorenzo breaks off his conversation, regarding DaVinci.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
My name is Leonardo DaVinci.  
Perhaps you ve heard of me?  I am 
designing your Easter columbina.

LORENZO
Aren t you the eccentric Verrocchio 
employs?  

DAVINCI
I am an artist, yes.  And an 
engineer of some note.

LORENZO
Really?   Extortionist  was the 
phrase I heard Gentile Becchi using. 

Lorenzo s entourage LAUGHS.  But DaVinci presses on.

DAVINCI
I drive a stiff bargain, it s true.
But the fact is, I ve designed a 
more ambitious series of devices 
that I know your percipient mind 
will take interest in --

As DaVinci reaches for his notebook, CAPTAIN DRAGONETTI, 
leader of the Companions of the Night (Florence s secret 
police), steps forward, threatening.

DRAGONETTI
Move along, citizen.  

DaVinci reads the implicit violence in Dragonetti s face and 
slowly closes his notebook.  Lorenzo offers a polite smile --25.


LORENZO
Some other time, perhaps.

-- and continues on his way.  His retinue follows suit, with 
Piero casting a meaningful glower back at his son.  Then 
Lucrezia, offering a final, furtive glance.

DAVINCI
(simmering)
I m wounded, Nico.  I need wine. 

NICO
You said you were out of money.

DAVINCI
I lied.



DaVinci and Nico traverse the empty streets, supporting an 
extremely drunk Zoroaster between them.  As they reach an 
intersection, DaVinci transfers Zoroaster s weight to Nico.

DAVINCI
Take him, Nico.  He won t make it 
home alone.  

NICO
Are you sure, maestro?  There are 
bound to be rogues about.

DAVINCI
Then I ll fit right in.  Go on.

Nico nods.  But as he starts away, Zoroaster briefly stirs 
from his stupor.  He looks at DaVinci, his speech slurred. 

ZOROASTER
Leo --?

DAVINCI
Yes, my friend?

ZOROASTER
I didn t deal you the Hanged Man.  
That was all you.  It was an omen.  
Just like the two-headed calf.

DAVINCI
I don t believe in omens, Zo.  And 
neither should you.

ZOROASTER
-- okay --

As Nico heads off, struggling beneath Zoroaster s 
uncooperative weight, DaVinci smiles.  He turns into an 
alley, WHISTLING to himself.  Then he stops --

A HOODED FIGURE

Steps from the shadows, sword in hand, radiating menace.  
DaVinci is briefly alarmed, then relaxes as he realizes:

DAVINCI
I know it s you, Dragonetti. 
(drawing his dagger)
Didn t you learn anything earlier?  
I ll wipe the gutters with you.  

Then, a DOZEN MORE HOODED FIGURES emerge from the shadows.  32.


DAVINCI (CONT D)
Oh.  I guess you did learn.



An imposing, crenelated fortress, housing both the offices of 
the magistrate and its prison.  SCREAMS echo from within.



CLOSE ON DaVinci, bruised, yet determined.  His right hand is 
a mess, many fingers obviously broken.  He sits on a bench, 
his notebook and sketch pencil at the ready in his LEFT HAND.  

Zoroaster and Nico sit beside him.  Zoroaster is hung-over.

ZOROASTER
You look more wretched than I.  
Perhaps you should see a physician?

DAVINCI
I m fine.

Zoroaster casts a dubious look at Nico, who shrugs.

ZOROASTER
They re executing a Jew today.  
Apparently they caught him breaking 
into a book shop on the Via Dei 
Librai.  It should be great sport.  

DAVINCI
I m not sure a man s death should 
be characterized as sport.  

ZOROASTER
This spot is too sunny.  Can t we 
move over into the shade?

DAVINCI
No.35.


NICO
Why?  And why did we have to come 
here so damned early?

DaVinci stares at a fountain that is bracketed by FLOWER 
VENDORS.  As he speaks, a CHURCH BELL tolls --

DAVINCI
Because every morning, at precisely 
seven a.m., Lucrezia Donati comes 
to this spot to purchase flowers. 

Like clockwork, LUCREZIA and her staff appear.  DaVinci 
begins sketching.  He quickly appraises it -- then tosses it 
away and starts another.  Zoroaster glances down at the work.

ZOROASTER
She s appealing.  I ll grant you 
that --

Zoroaster nods to an OLD BEGGAR WOMAN a few yards away.

ZOROASTER (CONT D)
-- but I d rather bed that old 
toothless hag over there.

DAVINCI
Now you re just being contrary.

ZOROASTER
It takes no great skill to fuck a 
pretty face.  But a truly ugly 
woman, that actually requires 
discipline.  Done right, it can be 
a transcendent experience.  

TIME SLOWS

Lucrezia moves at a dream-like pace, her beautiful features 
drenched in sunlight, framed by the riot of colorful flowers --

-- then DaVinci tears a sketch from his notebook.  He rolls it 
into a tube, tying it with a ribbon.  He hands it to Nico.

DAVINCI
Run this over and make sure she 
knows where it came from.  

DaVinci and Zoroaster watch as he makes his way to Lucrezia, 
hands the drawing to her, then gestures back at them.

ZOROASTER
What the devil are you up to, Leo?36.


Lucrezia studies the drawing.  Then she looks up at DaVinci 
and says something to Nico.  He rushes back, excited.

NICO
She wants to speak with you.

DAVINCI
Tell her I m too busy.

DaVinci starts off in the opposite direction.  Zoroaster and 
Nico follow, confused.  In the distance, a TRUMPET sounds.  

ZOROASTER
You re turning her down?

DAVINCI
What do you care?  Weren t you the 
one extolling the virtues of 
transcendent hags?  There s a leper 
over there.  Go.  Fondle her lesions.
(nodding to Nico)
Tell her, Nico.  Timing is all.

Nico rushes off once more.  Lucrezia and her ladies are 
equally baffled by DaVinci s behavior.

MOMENTS LATER,

DaVinci, Zoroaster, and Nico, have joined a CROWD at the 
Bargello.  A gallows has been erected.  The HANGMAN readies 
his noose as a TOWN CRYER continues reeling them in.  

Presently, an ox-drawn cart is guided into the square, 
attended by the MAGISTRATE and a somber procession of ROBED 
MEN (the Confraternity known as the Black Company.)  

THE JEW RIDES IN THE CART-BED, 

chained, head shaved.  The crowd JEERS, throwing fruit at him.  
As the cart reaches the gallows, the Jew is fitted into the 
noose.  He remains stoic, eyes on the horizon.

DaVinci and Zoroaster angle for a closer view.  DaVinci takes 
out his notebook, sketching the proceedings.

Satisfied with the noose, the Hangman signals the Magistrate.  
Then something odd happens: the Jew looks directly at DaVinci.  

JEW
I am a son of Earth and Starry 
Heaven.  I am thirsty.  Please give 
me something to drink from the 
fountain of Memory.37.


DaVinci is startled.  But there s no time to ponder as the 
Hangman pulls the lever, letting the Jew drop.  The SOUND of 
his NECK BREAKING is audible.  The crowd APPLAUDS.

CLOSE ON DaVinci, shaken.  As the crowd disperses, Zoroaster 
and Nico catch sight of him, registering his odd reaction.

NICO
Are you alright, Maestro?

DAVINCI
I have to go.

And DaVinci hurries off, shoving his way into the crowd.



DaVinci spots a wood carved sign and rushes inside.



DaVinci treks to the summit of a hill.  Not much to speak of.  
The remnants of some stone walls and burial niches.   

Then DaVinci spies a LANTERN a way s off.  He follows it, 
coming upon a ragged cleft in an old tomb.  STEPS lead down 
into darkness.  And within that darkness, ANOTHER LANTERN.

DaVinci pauses.  The lanterns are meant to be a path, but the 
darkness evokes a feeling of dread in him.  He descends.38.



CHURCH BELLS ring.  It s Easter and Florence is celebrating.  
Banners, flowers, and tapestries hang from the windows.  
Citizens mill about, dressed as clowns, nymphs, and devils.

A PROCESSION OF ARMORED HORSEMEN winds through the crowd.  
The centerpiece is a giant wooden cart hauled by a garland-
strewn team of WHITE OXEN.  Before the cart; a GROUP OF MEN 
bearing a LARGE CANDLE, the so called  Holy Fire .

LORENZO MEDICI

Stands on the cathedral steps, along with Giuliano, Gentile 
Becchi, the ARCHBISHOP, and the rest of the Medici clan.  

ANGLE ON DAVINCI AND HIS FRIENDS

Zoroaster is dressed as BACCHUS, Verrocchio as a HERMIT, Nico 
as a JESTER.  Vanessa as a NYMPH.  DaVinci wears no costume. 

As the procession nears the cathedral, Lorenzo raises his 
arms and a CHEER goes up from the crowd.

ZOROASTER
Look at the drunken bastards, 
they re eating it up.  Lorenzo s 
nothing, if not a showman.51.


The Holy Fire is transferred to Lorenzo s retinue, who carry 
it into the Cathedral.  Verrocchio looks to DaVinci, nervous.

VERROCCHIO
It won t be long now.

The group watches as the thirty foot-high cart is moved to 
the center of the square, then loaded with FIREWORKS.

NICO
What if the Columbina misses its 
mark, Maestro?

ZOROASTER
Then you can kiss your master s 
learned ass goodbye.

Another weighted look passes between DaVinci and Verrocchio.  
But then -- DaVinci catches the eye of a MASKED WOMAN dressed 
as a scarlet-veiled harlot.  

ZOROASTER (CONT D)
That doxy with the big tits has been 
making eyes at you for an hour.

DAVINCI
So?

ZOROASTER
So she wants your prick, you 
pompous malt-worm.  And if you re 
not game to supply it, I will.

DaVinci smiles and throws an arm about Zoroaster s shoulder.

DAVINCI
If you dedicated a tenth of your 
sexual drive to other pursuits, you d 
be the richest man in Europe, Zo.

ZOROASTER
Yes, but my prick would be that 
much poorer.  

VERROCCHIO
Shhh.  The Columbina s about to fly.

Silence settles upon the crowd as the cathedral are opened --

THEN, THE COLUMBINA

Emerges from the Cathedral doors.  A six-foot wide confection 
of satin and gilt and feathers.  Gracefully flapping its 
wings, trailing a COMET S TAIL OF FIRE behind it.52.


The crowd is awe-struck as it flies over their heads, landing 
atop the fireworks-laden cart.  The flames quickly spread, 
and in seconds, FIREWORKS fountain up over the piazza.  

For Florence, it is a transformational moment.  A 
demonstration that God has graced their Republic.

The crowd CHEERS.  MUSICIANS burst out in song and the 
carnival begins.  Verrocchio hugs DaVinci, relieved.  Nico 
looks to Vanessa, boastful.

NICO
Did you see it?  I glued the 
feathers on.  Every one of them.

VANESSA
Well done, Nico!

She tousles his hair, but her eyes are on --

DAVINCI,

Who is LAUGHING, uncharacteristically losing himself in the 
moment.  And then, once again, he catches sight of --

THE SCARLET WOMAN,

Intermittently visible through the crowd.  She gestures to 
him.  Time slows.  And much to Vanessa s dismay, DaVinci 
follows her.  For a moment, he loses sight of the woman --

-- then he FINDS her once more, entering an alleyway.  
DaVinci follows her, like a sailor stalking a siren.
