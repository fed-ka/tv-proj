Vitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line
with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic.
WISEGUY #2
Ooh, they got tapioca. I love
tapioca.
(looks at Vitti)
You all right, Paul?
Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little.
WISEGUY #2
Can I have your tapioca?
A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from
his post. Then he nods to someone across the room.
COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in
response.
Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other
tough Hispanic gang members.
COYOTE
(to Vitti)
Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?
His friends laugh.
Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them.
COYOTE
Just keep walkin', Don Corleone.
There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing.
COYOTE
Shut up!
Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic.
COYOTE
I said, shut up, bitch!
7.
But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering
food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv.
COYOTE
You're a dead man, jefe!
Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly
whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray
and bursts into song.
VITTI
(singing, with
appropriate dance
moves)
'When you're a Jet,
You're a Jet all the way,
From your first cigarette
To your last dyin' day...'
Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts.
Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him
over the head with the tray.
VITTI
'When you're a Jet,
If the shit hits the fan,
You got brothers around,
You're a family man...'
COYOTE
You're a dead man, jefe!
Coyote rushes him, but Vitti sidesteps and hits him in the
face.
Guards move in from all sides.
Vitti jumps up on the
tabletop to escape them.
VITTI
(kicking at them,
singing)
'I like to be in America,
Okay by me in America...'
The guards drag him down and cuff his hands behind him, then
carry him out stiff as a board.
VITTI
'Tonight, tonight, won't be just
any night -- '
DISSOLVE TO:
A limo pulls up to an old, but well-maintained suburban
house, the family gets out and starts walking to the house.
8.
CUT TO:
The family crosses to the front door.
BEN
(sighs deeply)
I can't believe he's gone.
LAURA
I can't believe what you said about
him. Cold and withholding? You had
to tell everybody?
MICHAEL
Nice. Why didn't you just take a
swing at the casket?
Ben opens the front door and they go in.
CUT TO:
Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben.
Dr. Cutler observes
from a chair in the corner.
BEN
Paul, we're going to
give you some
tests to assess your
mental condition.
There's no pressure
-- just answer as
best you can. Do I
have your consent
to share the results
of these tests?
VITTI
Mommy's mad at me because I made a
boom on the rug.
14.
BEN
I'll take that as a yes. Okay, I'm
going to show you ten cards, each
containing a picture of an inkblot. I
want you to look at each card and tell
me what you see.
VITTI
I see you.
I see him.
I see a table.
BEN
Focus, Paul. You haven't seen the
card yet.
(hands him first card)
What does this look like to you? Take
your time.
Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card.
It's all white.
VITTI
It looks like snow.
BEN
No, Paul, the other side.
Vitti turns it over and makes a face.
VITTI
A bat.
A big bat. Or a weasel.
BEN
(taking notes)
Bat or weasel. All right.
VITTI
And he's got a little girl -- no, it's
a little boy -- in his teeth -- and
he's shakin' him and shakin' him
'cause the kid didn't wipe himself
good -- and the kid is screaming
because the bat-weasel ripped out his
throat and the blood is shootin' out
of his neck vein.
(pointing)
That's the blood.
Doctor Cutler looks worried.
BEN
(skeptical)
See anything else?
VITTI
Just the pussy with the teeth.
15.
BEN
(making more notes)
Pussy with teeth. Next card.
CUT TO:
SHAPES TEST
Vitti is literally trying to pound a square peg into a round
hole.
CUT TO:
VITTI AND BEN
BEN
Now try repeating the numbers
backwards. For instance, if I was 1-
2-3, you will say 3-2-1. Okay, 7-3-8.
VITTI
3-2-1.
BEN
Try again.
7-3-8.
VITTI
Blue.
CUT TO:
THEMATIC APPERCEPTION TEST
Vitti studies a vague and ambiguous photograph of a man
standing beside a bed with a sleeping woman and child on it.
BEN
Just tell me what you think is going
on in this picture.
VITTI
This is a picture of a guy -- nice,
hardworking guy -- comes home and
finds out his wife's been screwin'
this midget while he was out of town.
BEN
(appalled, makes
a note)
Screwing a midget. And how does the
story end?
VITTI
I think he works over the midget for a
while, then he blows 'em away.
16.
BEN
The wife or the midget?
VITTI
(smirks)
Trick question, right?
Both of 'em.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER TEST
BEN
Okay, Paul. Last test. In this one,
I'm going to start a sentence and you
complete it any way you want to.
Ready? 'I get
angry -- '
VITTI
Yes.
BEN
No, you're supposed to complete the
sentence.
VITTI
I did.
I said 'yes.'
BEN
I wasn't asking if you agreed or
disagreed; it was more like, 'I get
angry when -- '
VITTI
-- whenever.
BEN
Well, that about does it for me.
CUT TO:
The gate opens and Ben coaxes Vitti outside.
A guard watches
them.
BEN
Okay, Paul -- this way.
Vitti comes out carrying an overnight bag, walking like a
zombie. Ben leads him over to the car and opens the door for
him. Vitti keeps walking, passing the car.
BEN
This way, Paul. Over here.
Here we
go.
Ben helps Vitti into the car.
One of Vitti's legs is still
outside.
BEN
Leg, Paul.
Leg up.
Ben lifts Vitti's leg into the car and closes the door.
CUT TO:
22.
Ben and Vitti pull into the driveway and get out of the car.
BEN
Want to grab your stuff?
VITTI
I'm not gonna be here that long.
Jelly's pickin' me up in an hour.
BEN
Paul! I don't think you understand.
You're in my custody. I could get in
a lot of trouble if you screw up.
VITTI
Don't worry about it.
I'll call you
tomorrow.
BEN
Oh, no. You want to go back to Sing
Sing? Thursday's meatloaf night. I
can have you back there in no time.
The U.S. Attorney was very clear. You
stay with me; therapy every day; you
can't leave the area without
permission --
VITTI
What are you, my father now?
BEN
And you
have to get a job as soon as
you're
well enough, which is now. So
are you
coming in with me or do I have
to make
a phone call?
Vitti relents and grabs his stuff from the back seat.
VITTI
I'm comin'.
Some fuckin' life this is
gonna be.
He follows Ben up the stairs.
CUT TO:
The suburban street is dark and quiet and all the lights are
off in the house.
WOMAN (V.O.)
Ohhhhh!
Ohhhhh, Paul!
CUT TO:
Agents Cerrone and Miller sit in a sedan with a small,
sophisticated-looking microphone trained on the Sobel house
just down the street. They hear the high-pitched MOANING.
Miller gives Cerrone a look.
CERRONE
Oh, come on.
Nobody sounds like that.
CUT TO:
Laura and Ben are hosting a brunch for the out-of-town
relatives. Laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated,
older woman.
32.
LAURA
Aunt Ester, I'm so sorry we had to put
you up at the hotel. We wanted you
here with us, but we had an unexpected
house guest.
She glares at Ben.
AUNT ESTHER
(sighs)
Your father always had room for us.
BEN
I'm sorry.
(mutters to Laura)
Next time I lose a parent, I'll be
sure to reserve the guest room.
A DOOR SLAMS somewhere, then Sheila storms into the room
sobbing, her hair askew, tucking her blouse into her skirt.
SHEILA
(screaming)
Go to hell, Paul! You just go to
hell!
VITTI (O.S.)
Go ahead! Get out of here, you crazy
fuckin' whore.
Vitti charges into the room, his robe open. From the
reactions of everyone in the room, it's clear he's not
wearing anything under it.
VITTI
Go back to turning tricks in Jersey
for all I fuckin' care.
Sheila exits and slams the front door.
Vitti sees everyone
staring at him. He closes his robe.
VITTI
How's it goin'?
(sees buffet)
Oh, we got food. Good.
Vitti heads for the buffet.
LAURA
(smiling)
Ben?
BEN
(quickly)
Paul?
33.
Vitti bellies up to the buffet, stepping between an older
couple. He eyes the food disdainfully.
VITTI
Oh, great. Jew food. Who do you have
to fuck to get some bacon around here?
The woman reacts in horror.
VITTI
Not you, I'm guessing.
BEN
(snags Vitti's arm)
Why don't we go to my office?
I'll
make you a plate.
CUT TO:
Ben and Jelly walk out to the driveway where Jelly's Buick is
parked.
JELLY
So. Long time no see.
You look good,
Doc.
BEN
(trying to be pleasant)
And you, Jelly -- you look --
(can't find words for
how he looks)
Did you get a haircut? I thought you
were in prison.
JELLY
It would appear not.
BEN
How'd you get out?
JELLY
New trial. The evidence in my first
trail was, you know, tainted. Turns
out two of the witnesses against me
changed their minds -- and the third
one, he died after a short illness.
BEN
What did he have?
JELLY
Gunshot wound to the head.
BEN
That's not an illness.
42.
JELLY
Yeah, but it is short.
Vitti, now dressed, comes out of the house and crosses to the
car.
BEN
(to Vitti)
Where are you going?
VITTI
I got stuff to do.
BEN
What kind of stuff?
VITTI
(as he gets into
the car)
Calm down. I'll be back.
BEN
You can't leave without my permission.
VITTI
Oh, yeah?
Watch me.
Drive, Jelly.
Jelly STARTS the CAR and slowly backs out of the driveway.
Ben runs after the car, talking to Vitti through the open
window.
BEN
That's it, Paul. I forbid you to go.
VITTI
Stop sweating, Doc.
I'll be back.
Vitti puts the window up.
BEN
(shouts anxiously)
If you screw this up, Paul -- Paul!
The car pulls away.
BEN
(angrily)
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
Ben turns and sees his Aunt Goldie on the porch.
AUNT GOLDIE
So, the fat one -- he's single?
CUT TO:
43.
Jelly pulls up, Vitti gets out and strides up to the front
door of a nice home on Staten Island and RINGS the BELL.
CUT TO:
45.
Vitti is trying to sell an $80,000 Audi to the
MacINERNYS, an upscale middle-aged couple. Vitti opens
the trunk.
VITTI
Look at the size of that trunk. You
could fit three people in there.
(off their
shocked looks)
Not people -- suitcases. It's a joke.
The MacInernys laugh uncertainly.
VITTI
So what are you driving now?
MR. MacINERNY
We have a Lexus.
VITTI
(nods)
It's a fancy Toyota, right? The Japs
make good cars, but I ain't that quick
to forget Pearl Harbor.
The MacInernys look doubtful.
CUT TO:
Vitti is back in bed in his robe, still asleep. The door
opens and Laura enters with an interior decorator who has
fabric samples over her arm.
LAURA
Now in here, I thought we'd get rid of
the wallpaper and maybe put in some
wainscoting --
She sees Vitti and quickly steers the decorator back outside.
54.
LAURA
(to decorator)
Don't look, don't look.
She comes back in, closes the bedroom door and confronts
Vitti who is still groggy from his troubling dream.
LAURA
Do you realize it's almost noon?
VITTI
Really? Do me a favor, honey -- make
me a sandwich.
LAURA
You want a sandwich? Make it
yourself. I'm not afraid of you, Mr.
Oh-I'm-A-Great-Big-Mobster Man. I
want you out of my house.
LAURA (CONT'D)
I've had
it with the bathrobe and the
skulking
around and the girlfriend
who, I'm
sorry, is so obviously faking
it's not
even funny. Enough!
VITTI
Coulda had that sandwich made by now.
LAURA
(tries new tack)
Okay. You don't like me and I don't
like you. We can at least agree on
that, right?
VITTI
Okay.
LAURA
I'm going to be honest with you -- I'm
a very anxious person --
VITTI
Hey!
Me, too.
LAURA
We have so much in common. Anyway,
this is not helping me, it's not
helping my marriage, and I know Ben
really needs some alone time. So I'm
asking you -- as a human being --
could you please leave?
(off Vitti's look)
Yes, I'll make you a sandwich.
55.
VITTI
Ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato,
mayonnaise, no onion.
CUT TO:
Jelly
comes out the front door with Vitti's suitcases as Ben
pulls
into the driveway. He gets out of the car holding a
small
bag from the drugstore and sees Vitti coming out the
front
door. Ben stops him on the porch.
BEN
(concerned)
Where are you going?
VITTI
Where am I going? The orphanage found
my real parents. They want me back.
(to Jelly)
Put those in the car.
(to Ben)
I'm goin' to Jelly's.
Jelly carries the luggage to his car parked in the driveway.
BEN
(to Vitti)
The hell you are. You're supposed to
be in my custody. We have therapy
today.
VITTI
For what? The more we talk the worse
I get. I had that dream again.
BEN
The one where you're Mussolini?
VITTI
No, the other one.
BEN
The limp sword dream?
JELLY
(at car)
I probably shouldn't be listening to
this.
VITTI
So don't!
JELLY
Sorry.
56.
BEN
(to Vitti)
Do you think this dream might be
sexual?
VITTI
I know what you're thinkin'. The
sword is my cock and I can't get it
up, but that ain't it. I saw Sheila
last night and I had a hard-on you
could swing from.
BEN
(winces)
I don't want to know that.
VITTI
You coulda hung wet towels on it.
JELLY
(calls out)
He's like a racehorse in that area.
BEN
Okay!
I get it.
VITTI
(to
Jelly)
Wait in the
car!
(to
Ben)
So what does
it mean?
Ben sits on the wicker divan.
BEN
Sex can represent a lot of things. In
your case I think it's about
performance anxiety. Trying to find a
job that fits.
VITTI
Doc -- nothing's gonna fit. That
nine-to-five bullshit -- I'll fuckin'
kill myself if I have to do that for
the rest of my life. You know they
take taxes out of your check? What
the fuck is that? I'm doomed. I'm
gonna end up selling hot dogs on the
street.
(starts breathing hard
and sweating)
Look at me. I'm havin' a fuckin'
panic attack here. My heart's beatin'
like a rabbit.
BEN
You're hyperventilating.
57.
He empties the drugstore bag and hands it to Vitti.
BEN
Breathe into this.
Vitti sits on a wicker chair.
VITTI
(speaks through bag)
This is your fault.
BEN
Excuse me?
VITTI
Tellin' me I have to get a job like
I'm some fuckin' nobody. It was
humiliating! Thanks a lot.
BEN
(jumps up, in a
total rage)
Hey, I'm doing the best I can!
If you
can't appreciate that, or if my
best
isn't good enough for you, then
maybe
you should find somebody else to
talk
to, you selfish prick!
Ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob,
then quickly pulls himself together.
BEN
Sorry.
VITTI
What the hell was that?
BEN
I'm fine.
I'm grieving.
It's a
process.
Ben takes a pill bottle out of his pocket and pops a couple
of pills.
VITTI
Now what are you takin'?
BEN
Echinacea and goldenseal. Do you know
the TV show 'Little Caesar'?
VITTI
Yeah, I know it.
BEN
The producer of that show is a man
58.
named Raoul Berman. A mutual friend
told him I knew you and Mr. Berman
called me this morning. He wants to
meet you.
VITTI
For what?
BEN
Meet him and find out.
CUT TO:
Ben and Laura walk up to a trendy Japanese restaurant in
Chelsea. Ben is really keyed up.
LAURA
We finally got him out of the house --
why are we having dinner with him? I
mean, how professional is that?
BEN
This is not social. Paul's meeting a
television producer who might have a
job for him. He's nervous and wants
me here as a buffer. I'm a buffer,
that's all.
LAURA
He's a grown man. I don't see why he
needs a chaperone.
BEN
He doesn't. He needs a buffer.
I'm
here in buffer capacity only.
LAURA
Ben, if you say 'buffer' one more time
--
Ben pops a couple of pills.
LAURA
Didn't you just take two of those?
BEN
No, that was something else.
LAURA
Well, you better not drink anything.
You know what happens.
BEN
Laura? I'm a doctor?
I think I know
what I'm doing.
59.
Ben opens the door and motions for Laura to enter.
BEN
(quietly, behind
her back)
Buffer.
CUT TO:
Jelly stands in front of an apartment building parking
garage. A guy comes walking up the ramp toward him. As he
comes nearer, we see that the guy is the Gunman from the
restaurant.
JELLY
Hey, pal -- got a light?
The guy stops, pulls out a Zippo and lights it for Jelly.
GUNMAN
Where's your cigarette?
JELLY
I'm trying to cut down.
The Gunman recognizes Jelly and desperately reaches for the
gun in his pocket, but Jelly hauls off and whacks the guy
across the back of the head with a sap. As
he slumps into
Jelly's arms, Vitti steps out of a doorway and Jelly drags
the gunman into the garage.
CUT TO:
Vitti and Jelly stand with the Gunman on the roof of the
parking garage, four stories above the ground. The guy's
arms are bound. Jelly ties a rope around his ankles.
VITTI
I'm gonna ask you once nicely.
Who
you working for?
GUNMAN
Fuck you.
VITTI
Fuck me?
Fine. Jelly?
Jelly shoves the guy to the parapet at the edge of the roof,
grabs him by the legs and hangs him over the side of the
building. The guy screams.
VITTI
I'll ask you again.
Who you working
for?
The guy keeps screaming.
JELLY
He's screamin' too loud.
Hold on a
second.
Jelly swings the guy against the building, hitting his head
and dazing him momentarily.
JELLY
Go ahead.
VITTI
Who are you working for?
66.
GUNMAN
Nobody!
VITTI
Drop him, Jelly.
GUNMAN
Okay! Okay!
Rigazzi!
I'm working
for Rigazzi!
VITTI
Pull him back up.
Jelly drops the guy.
The Gunman plunges three stories and lands heavily in a
dumpster full of garbage.
VITTI
What's the matter with you?
JELLY
You said drop him.
VITTI
I said pull him back up.
JELLY
That's not what I heard.
VITTI
You heard what you wanted to hear.
JELLY
Okay, you got me there.
CUT TO:
A "family" business in Jersey.
CUT TO:
The light from outside barely penetrates the painted windows
of the shabby office.
LOU RIGAZZI, aka "Lou the Wrench," the aging boss of the
Rigazzi family, sits in the half-light as a couple of his
soldiers enter with the battered and hobbling Gunman between
them.
RIGAZZI
What the hell happened to you?
67.
GUNMAN
Vitti threw me off a roof.
RIGAZZI
Vitti? You talked to Vitti?
What did
you say to him?
GUNMAN
Nothing. I didn't tell him anything.
Mr. Rigazzi, can I
go -- I think my leg's broken.
RIGAZZI
That must hurt.
Rigazzi pulls out a GUN with a silencer and SHOOTS the
Gunman.
RIGAZZI
I hate to see people in pain.
(to soldiers)
Get him out of here.
SOLDIER
What about Vitti?
RIGAZZI
(musing)
He's a hard man to kill. But he's not
immortal. Our time will come.
CUT TO:
A big, family barbecue is going on in a back yard in Queens.
Several children are splashing in an over-sized, above-ground
swimming pool. Oddly, the children appear to be shouting and
laughing but make no sound.
At the barbecue, Nicky Caesar is watching his friend MELLO
turn Italian sausage on the grill.
CAESAR
I like mine burnt.
MELLO
I don't know how you like your
sausage? Twenty fuckin' years we been
doin' this. So you got the money?
The wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in
their faces.
68.
CAESAR
(coughing, eyes
watering)
Not all of it. I'm still light about
fifteen large.
(blinded by smoke)
Can we cut? This is ridiculous.
RAOUL (O.S.)
(shouts)
Cut! Can you do something about the
fucking smoke?
We PULL BACK to reveal the set of "Little Caesar." Assistant
directors and production assistants echo the director:
"We're cut!" "Reset!" "Effects!"
Vitti observes the action sitting in a director's chair,
still brooding over the previous night's events. Raoul sits
next to him.
RAOUL
(to Vitti)
This is the problem with shooting on
location. But it's worth it for the
authenticity.
VITTI
Yeah, this is real authentic.
RAOUL
(calls out)
Tony! Come here a second.
(to Vitti)
Anthony Bella. He plays Nicky Caesar.
VITTI
I know who he is. They used to watch
the show up at Sing Sing.
RAOUL
(delighted)
Are you shitting me?
ANTHONY BELLA joins them.
RAOUL
Tony, this is Paul Vitti.
TONY BELLA
(Australian accent)
You don't have to tell me who he is.
(shakes Paul's hand)
It's a pleasure, mate.
69.
VITTI
(reacting to accent)
Mate? I don't believe this! You're
an English guy? You ain't even
Italian.
TONY BELLA
Australian-Italian. We got some
paisans down under.
VITTI
Down under what?
RAOUL
(to Tony Bella)
How incredible is this? Paul tells me
they watch the show in Sing Sing!
TONY BELLA
Fantastic!
That's so fuckin' great.
VITTI
I wouldn't wet my pants over it.
They
watch 'Supermarket Sweep,' too.
Raoul laughs hard.
VITTI
You laugh too much.
TONY BELLA
So, Paul, you going to join us?
Vitti looks around, his future plans now beginning to form.
VITTI
Yeah.
You got a good setup here.
TONY BELLA
Great.
See you later then.
He exits.
Vitti turns to Raoul.
VITTI
Coupla things, though. I don't know
who makes these decisions, but some of
this, it don't look right.
RAOUL
(concerned)
I sensed it myself. Which elements
strike you as wrong?
VITTI
The people mainly. I mean, you got a
boss who speaks Australian. What the
fuck is that? And I'm guessing your
70.
background is -- what?
RAOUL
The theater, mostly.
VITTI
Yeah, the theater. So how about if I
bring in some guys that I know -- you
know, more 'authentic.'
RAOUL
I would be eternally grateful.
Anything else?
VITTI
(thinks)
Yeah. One of those trailers like the
stars have.
RAOUL
(slight hesitation)
Done.
(shakes his hand)
I'll put that in the works right now.
He hurries off to talk to his assistant.
Jelly comes up to
Vitti.
JELLY
You really gonna do this?
VITTI
No fuckin' way. I've had it with this
job bullshit. A week of this and I'd
either shoot myself or shoot Raoul.
But it's good cover while I figure out
my next move. Call the guys.
JELLY
You got it.
CUT TO:
MONTAGE
Jelly and Vitti's old crew, MO-MO, BIGS, TUNA, EDDIE COKES,
and eight or nine other wiseguys walk en masse into base
camp.
Vitti's guys go to the front of the lunch line, forcing the
crew aside.
A big, pop-out trailer labeled "Mr. Vitti," guarded by three
of his guys. Tuna brings a lunch tray and knocks on the
door. Jelly opens the door and takes the tray.
Vitti conferring with Raoul and Tony Bella on the script,
71.
ripping out whole sections.
Vitti in the makeup trailer getting a haircut and manicure
while he smokes a cigar and talks on his cell phone.
Vitti with the costumer, approving and nixing various
wardrobe choices, while Jelly steals an expensive watch in
the b.g.
Vitti in a massage chair getting a backrub from a masseuse.
A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT approaches him.
P.A. (PRODUCTION ASSISTANT)
They're ready to start shooting, Mr.
Vitti.
VITTI
Yeah, ten minutes, tell 'em.
Eddie Devol, Patty LoPresti's guy, watches Vitti from a safe
distance.
CUT TO:
Ben comes out of the market carrying several grocery bags and
a small prescription bag. Two Mafia SOLDIERS step up beside
him and urge him toward a big stretch LIMO IDLING at the
curb.
SOLDIER
Walk this way.
BEN
There must be some mistake.
I didn't
order a limo.
SOLDIER
Get in the car.
CUT TO:
76.
The trucks and trailers are arranged on a parking lot.
A car
pulls up and Lou Rigazzi gets out with his bodyguards.
DRIVER
Should I wait here, Mr. Rigazzi?
RIGAZZI
No, pull the car up your ass and wait
there.
CUT TO:
Patty takes Vitti's arm and walks with him.
PATTY
I heard you had some more trouble.
VITTI
One of Rigazzi's guys took a shot at
me.
She stops at the extras' makeup table and starts primping in
the mirror.
PATTY
I don't have to tell you, Paul. Alone
on the street you don't stand a
chance. That's what the family's all
about. Since the old days, when the
grandfathers first came over. That's
not something you just walk away from.
VITTI
Yeah, I know. When you're a Jet,
you're a Jet all the way.
PATTY
So you want to tell me what's going on
here? It looks like you got your
whole crew back together.
VITTI
Nothing's going on.
They're actors.
PATTY
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're
planning something. I'm feeling very
left out.
VITTI
(quietly)
Okay. Something big is going down,
but you're getting a cut. My hand to
God.
77.
PATTY
You're a good friend, Paul. And I
would never think of insisting on
this, but I'd feel better if you
brought in Eddie and some of my guys
to help with the job.
VITTI
I don't think so.
PATTY
Then I'll have to insist.
VITTI
Whatever.
Raoul approaches and eyes Patty disdainfully.
RAOUL
Oh, dear God. First of all,
sweetheart, we're not shooting the
hooker scene until tomorrow. And the
hair -- please, what is that?
PATTY
Excuse me?
VITTI
Raoul, this is a friend of mine.
Patty LoPresti.
Raoul freezes, recognizing the name.
RAOUL
Mrs. LoPresti -- I am so very, very
Raoul wheels on a production assistant who happens to be
passing by.
RAOUL
How dare you not inform me Mrs.
LoPresti was on the set. You're
fired!
(to Patty)
Enjoy your visit with us. If there's
anything I can do --
PATTY
Go fuck yourself.
RAOUL
Immediately.
Raoul moves away quickly.
Patty turns back to Vitti.
PATTY
It's good to have you back, Paul.
78.
(kisses Vitti on
the cheek)
We'll be in touch.
She exits.
CUT TO:
As Patty and her men walk away down one aisle of trucks and
campers, Rigazzi and his men walk down the next aisle heading
for the set.
They narrowly miss seeing each other.
CUT TO:
Ben arrives looking for Vitti. He
sees Patty approaching and
freezes, then quickly ducks behind
a nearby truck, shielding
his crotch. Patty and her men pass
by. Ben waits until they
pass, then comes out of hiding and
hurries on.
CUT TO:
A mildly-distraught Raoul is huddled with Vitti.
RAOUL
I mean, tell me -- was she angry?
Am
I in any danger?
VITTI
No, you're fine. But you might want
to have somebody else start your car
the next couple of weeks.
RAOUL
I'll have Brian do it.
He's new.
Rigazzi and his men join them.
RIGAZZI
(to Vitti)
Could I talk to you for a second?
RAOUL
(eyeing Rigazzi)
Oh, what is this now, the bus and
truck tour of Guys and Dolls?
VITTI
This is Lou Rigazzi.
79.
Raoul freezes.
RAOUL
(a horrified whisper)
'The Wrench.'
RAOUL (CONT'D)
(taking Rigazzi's
hand)
Please, forgive me. I'm on
painkillers -- half the time I don't
know what I'm saying.
Raoul kisses Rigazzi's hand.
Rigazzi yanks it away.
RIGAZZI
Get lost.
RAOUL
Certainly.
(as he exits)
Brian! Get my car!
RIGAZZI
(to Vitti)
I need a couple minutes.
VITTI
(nodding)
This way.
CUT TO:
Vitti and Rigazzi stand at the table.
Rigazzi's soldiers are
nearby.
RIGAZZI
The guy who shot at you -- he was
acting on his own. I never gave an
order.
VITTI
Is that right?
RIGAZZI
And he's been taken care of. There
won't be another incident. Unless
you're thinkin' of workin' for Patty
LoPresti.
VITTI
Me?
No.
RIGAZZI
Good.
Then I got no beef with you.
80.
VITTI
Thanks.
I'll sleep much better.
RIGAZZI
Because
that would not be the way to
go. You
want to back a winner, which
is gonna
be me. It only makes sense.
You come
work for us. I'll treat you
right.
VITTI
I don't think so.
RIGAZZI
(a beat)
Well, so much for sleeping better.
Rigazzi smiles and pats Vitti's cheek, then exits with his
soldiers.
CUT TO:
Ben walks in and sees Vitti's guys sitting around.
JELLY
Hey, Dr. Sobel?
BEN
Jelly, hi.
(recognizing some
of the others)
Hey! Yo-Yo!
JELLY
It's Mo-Mo.
BEN
Right. I was thinking of the cellist.
How's it going?
MO-MO
Goin' good. I did a 'Law and Order'
last week, I had a line on 'Sex and
the City' --
TUNA
I'm up for a recurring on 'NYPD Blue.'
BEN
That's great.
Have you seen Paul?
JELLY
Yeah, I think he's in his camper.
81.
BEN
His camper.
CUT TO:
The camera rolls.
83.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
We're rolling.
SOUNDMAN
Sound speed.
RAOUL
(shouts)
Action!
ON ROOFTOP
Jelly and Tony Bella drag Ben kicking and screaming to the
edge of the roof and hang him over the edge.
On the ground, Raoul and Vitti look up, watching the action.
RAOUL
(doubtful)
Does that screaming sound real to you?
VITTI
Oh, yeah.
That sounds real.
CUT TO:
85.
Ben's car speeds up suddenly. The black Mercedes behind him
speeds up, too, as does a third car that has joined the
chase.
CUT BACK TO:
Pedestrians scatter as Ben makes a sudden turn into a bank
drive-thru. He over-steers and wipes out an ATM machine,
sending up a cloud of bills that flutter down like confetti.
Two police officers are parked at the curb. They hear a HORN
HONKING, and turn just as Ben's car comes flying past them.
The cops start to pull out but stop short as the Benz blows
86.
by, swerving to avoid hitting them.
The cops take off in hot
pursuit.
CUT TO:
Ben's car races past an industrial area with the Mercedes
right on its tail.
CUT TO:
Ben's car bounces over some railroad tracks and sails into a
warehouse complex on the river with the Mercedes still only a
few car lengths behind.
87.
CUT TO:
Vitti rockets out from between buildings and races through a
parking lot toward the river with the Benz on his tail.
CUT BACK TO:
Vitti throws a 180, SKIDDING to a stop just inches from the
river's edge. The Benz, with the newspaper covering the
windshield, sails past them and right off the embankment. It
seems to hang in the air for a long time, then lands with a
big splash and starts to sink almost immediately.
BEN AND VITTI
They jump out of the car and watch the Mercedes disappear
under the water.
BEN
(aghast)
You think they'll get out?
VITTI
Yeah, that's James Bond and the 'Sea
Hunt' guy in there, so they got a
pretty good shot.
They hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING. Vitti starts walking
away quickly. Ben follows after him.
BEN
Where're you going?
VITTI
I gotta take care of something.
BEN
But your parole officer --
VITTI
Send my regrets.
BEN
I'm warning you. If you leave now --
VITTI
So long, Doc.
Vitti takes off running, ducking behind the rows of parked
cars.
89.
BEN
(calling after him)
That's it! I'm finished! You're on
your own now, pal! I'm --
POLICE CARS and the FBI CAR SCREECH into the parking lot and
surround Ben.
BEN
(quietly)
-- screwed.
CUT TO:
Police divers search for the sunken Mercedes in the middle of
the channel.
On shore, Ben leans against a government car looking tired
and distraught while Chapin berates him.
CHAPIN
Where is he, Dr. Sobel?
BEN
I wish I knew.
CHAPIN
Well, considering that he's in your
custody, that's not quite the answer I
was looking for. He's got something
big in the works. You want to tell me
what you know?
BEN
I don't know anything. As far as I
can tell, he's making a real effort to
go straight.
CHAPIN
Yeah, that's why I've got two corpses
at the bottom of the river.
He reaches through the open car window into his briefcase and
pulls out a file of photographs.
CHAPIN
Here. Vitti with Sal Masiello. Vitti
with Patty LoPresti. Vitti with Lou
Rigazzi. Let me know -- I can order
some wallet size for you. I've got
more than enough to put him away again
without these. Violation of parole,
second-degree murder here. When I
really start digging, it'll be amazing
90.
what I come up with. You have twenty-
four hours to find him and deliver him
to me. Otherwise you're looking at
obstruction of justice, and accessory
to felony manslaughter. And trust me,
Dr. Sobel, if you don't like me now,
you really don't want to see me in
court.
BEN
I'm getting that.
Can I go now?
He starts for his car.
CHAPIN
You can't take your car. We're
impounding it as evidence.
BEN
(exasperated)
Then can somebody give me a ride home?
CHAPIN
Yeah, the government runs a limousine
service. The number is 1-800-Fuck
Off.
Chapin walks away.
CUT TO:
Vitti makes his way past the trailers, heading for his car.
As he passes the makeup trailer, the door opens and Tony
Bella sticks his head out.
TONY BELLA
Paul!
Excellent!
VITTI
Can't really talk right now, mate.
Headin' out.
TONY BELLA
Two seconds. Please, Paul.
It's
really important.
Vitti looks pissed.
CUT TO:
The door flies open and Tony Bella comes flying out of the
trailer backwards, hitting the pavement hard. Vitti charges
out of the trailer and storms away. Tony wipes blood from
under his nose.
TONY BELLA
That was good.
My character could do
that.
CUT TO:
A cab pulls up to the house, and Ben gets out.
94.
He walks up the driveway and sees Jelly's car parked at the
back door and a big man in a dark suit and tie wiping the
windshield.
BEN
(irritated)
Jelly!
Where's Paul?
The guy in the suit turns.
It's Michael.
BEN
Michael?
What are you doing?
MICHAEL
Working.
BEN
(pleasantly
surprised)
You got a job? That's great. Look
how handsome you look in that suit.
What's the job?
MICHAEL
(reluctantly)
I'm working for Mr. Vitti.
I'm his
driver.
BEN
Oh, no, you're not!
MICHAEL
You keep telling me to get a job!
BEN
I meant making sandwiches at the
Subway, not driving a getaway car!
MICHAEL
He's paying me twenty dollars an hour.
BEN
I don't care if he pays you two
hundred an hour, you're not doing it.
MICHAEL
Dad --
BEN
He had no right to ask you without my
permission. Where is he?
MICHAEL
I can't tell you.
BEN
What do you mean you can't tell me?
95.
MICHAEL
I promised I'd never repeat anything I
heard in the car. I took an oath.
BEN
You took an oath! Oh, my God!
Was
there blood involved?
MICHAEL
Dad, I gave my word.
Laura comes out of the house.
LAURA
Ben? Where've you been?
What
happened to you?
BEN
(minimizing)
I was
in a car chase. There
was a
little
shooting -- not that much
really
-- then they -- drove into the
river.
It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
LAURA
When is this going to end?
BEN
Tonight, I hope. I just have to find
him and --
LAURA
Why? A few days ago you weren't even
sure you still wanted to be a
therapist. Now you're going to risk
your life again for that lout.
BEN
Yeah, but he's an amazing lout, isn't
he? I can't quit now. You know that.
LAURA
(relents)
Go.
Just don't get shot -- please?
BEN
I love you.
They kiss.
Then Ben turns to Michael.
BEN
All right, where is he?
MICHAEL
I can't.
96.
LAURA
(pops)
You tell your father right now or I'll
give you such a smack it won't even be
funny!
MICHAEL
(surprised)
Okay!
I dropped him at the club.
BEN
What club?
MICHAEL
Little Darling's in Queens.
BEN
Okay, Mafiaboy, give me your car keys.
MICHAEL
I'm grounded?
BEN
No, I'm borrowing your car.
He kisses Laura again and takes off.
CUT TO:
Several limos are parked outside a family-owned nightclub in
Queens.
Ben pulls up, leaning way back in the driver's seat of
Michael's, half-painted, modified '82 Honda Civic with the
BUBBLING MUFFLERS.
CUT TO:
Ben enters the club.
A moment later, Cerrone and Miller cruise by in an unmarked
car and park at the end of the block.
97.
CUT TO:
Agents Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the club from
their car parked across the street.
102.
CERRONE
(yawns, checks watch)
I wonder what it costs to keep that
many limos waiting for three-and-a-
half hours.
THEIR POV
A dozen men looking like Vitti and his crew come out of the
club and get into the limos.
MILLER (O.S.)
Everybody stand by. They're leaving.
The limos drive off.
At the corner, the FBI car pulls out and follows at a
discreet distance.
CUT TO:
The FBI car follows the limos across the bridge into
Manhattan.
CUT TO:
The limos pull up at the WWF Restaurant.
The FBI car stops
up the block.
CERRONE (V.O.)
(over radio)
312, all units. W.W.F. Restaurant.
Times Square.
The limo doors open and the passengers get out -- all
nondescript nobodies.
CUT TO:
106.
The big doors open and two trucks roll out carrying Vitti,
Ben and the crew.
CUT TO:
The trucks make their way past the aircraft carrier Intrepid
heading downtown.
DISSOLVE TO:
Vitti, Ben, and Eddie DeVol stand next to the treads of a
giant crane.
VITTI
(checks his watch)
I have five to three. They should
start movin' any minute.
BEN
(looking at his watch)
I have three-o-six.
VITTI
Let's see your watch.
Ben slips it off and hands it to him. Vitti smashes it on a
rock with the butt of his gun, then tosses it back to Ben.
Vitti's RADIO SQUAWKS and the spotter's voice is heard.
SPOTTER (V.O.)
(filtered)
They're moving!
Vitti keys his radio twice as a signal and holds up his
clenched fist to alert the guys on site with him.
CUT TO:
A CONVOY of vehicles emerges from the bowels of the building
and turns onto the street. In front and back are specially-
equipped SUVs, full of heavily-armed federal marshals; an
armored truck in the middle carries the gold.
107.
CUT TO:
The convoy RUMBLES past a block-long, high-rise construction
site, totally enclosed by a plywood wall around the
perimeter.
VITTI
He can hear the convoy passing outside the wall.
SPOTTER
He looks down on the convoy from a vantage point on a
scaffold high above the street. When the trucks are in the
right position, he waves to Vitti on the ground.
VITTI
sees the signal.
VITTI
(on walkie)
Go!
CUT TO:
A forty-foot, flat-bed trailer truck loaded with cement
conduit backs across the street and stops, blocking the path
of the convoy.
The lead SUV HONKS. The truck doesn't move. The CAPTAIN of
the marshals gets out and walks up to the truck. The driver
has slipped out the other side and disappeared.
Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes
around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points
crunching into the metal sides. Then the truck starts rising
off the pavement. A couple of determined marshals jump out
of their vehicles, race over and grab onto the bumpers as the
armored truck is lifted off the ground.
CUT TO:
A hundred-foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up. The
marshals hang on as long as they can, then prudently let go
and drop heavily to the street. Two marshals are still
clinging to the truck as it rises to a height of thirty feet,
then swings silently over the perimeter fencing.
108.
The marshals run around, frantically searching for a way into
the construction site.
CUT TO:
VITTI
Totally in charge, he strides up to the armored truck just as
his men finish cutting through the steel plate doors. Vitti
yanks the doors open..
Vitti and Ben stare in awe at the exposed contents of the
truck -- a fortune in gold bars.
VITTI
(shouts)
Get the ramp!
Eddie and his guys run up with a long, narrow track with
metal rollers and set it up at the rear of the gold truck.
EDDIE
(very excited)
You know, this might just fuckin'
work.
109.
BEN
You're gonna get in so much trouble.
CUT TO:
The marshals are trying to climb over the construction site
wall, but they're stopped by rolls of razor wire and
SUPPRESSING FIRE from inside the site.
LIEUTENANT
They can't get over the wire.
CAPTAIN
Then knock down the gates!
CUT TO:
The guys take the heavy bars out of the armored truck and run
them quickly along the rolling track into the bus.
CUT TO:
The marshals back up one of the SUVs and run it into the
gates again.
CUT TO:
The armored truck comes down fast and drops heavily to the
street. Federal MARSHALS swarm the truck and find Eddie, Al,
and Bobby sprawled in the back.
CAPTAIN
(screaming)
On the floor! Face-down!
Now!
AL PACINO
(to Eddie)
Nice goin'. Good plan.
ENORMOUS BOBBY
What's a sociopath?
The marshals handcuff them.
Suddenly, the marshals hear AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE coming
from the next block.
Uniformed SWAT COPS come running from that direction and
shout to the marshals.
SWAT LEADER
They're escaping out the back!
Get
over there! Move it!
The marshals rush toward the sound of the GUNFIRE and
disappear around the corner.
CUT TO:
NEXT BLOCK
As the marshals round the corner, they see a police shoot-out
in progress.
Wiseguys are FIRING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at cops who are pinned
down behind police cruisers.
The Captain of the marshals FIRES a warning SHOT in the air.
CAPTAIN
(on a bullhorn)
Freeze! Drop your weapons!
115.
The head wiseguy, Anthony Bella, turns in surprise.
TONY BELLA
What the hell is this?
RAOUL (O.S.)
(on his own bullhorn)
Cut, cut, cut! What the hell's going
on?
Raoul strides out into the street, furious, still talking
through his bullhorn.
RAOUL
(to the Captain)
Who are you? What are you doing in my
shot?
The Captain and the marshals look around and see that they're
on the set of "Little Caesar."
CAPTAIN
What are you doing on my street?
The Captain walks toward Raoul until they are almost face to
face, shouting at each other through their BULLHORNS.
RAOUL
I have a permit!
CAPTAIN
I don't give a shit about your permit!
The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR addresses the TV crew.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
All right, people. Back to one and
let's try it again!
(into his walkie-talkie)
Release the traffic and reset for
another take.
On the perimeters of the set, the PA's signal the off-duty
cops who work the set to release the real traffic they've
been holding on the cross streets.
A city bus passes behind Raoul and Tony Bella who are still
screaming at the Federal Marshal.
CUT TO:
In mid-block, SWAT cops step into the street and wave the bus
to a halt.
116.
CUT TO:
The bus pulls out and joins the flow of traffic heading
downtown.
CUT TO:
A Rigazzi company van is forced open by a team of FBI agents led
by Agent Miller. Stacked inside are forty gold bars.
Agent Cerrone comes out of the building with Lou Rigazzi and
several associates in handcuffs.
U.S. Attorney Chapin makes a statement to the media.
CHAPIN
Acting on intelligence we developed in
the last few days, the Justice
Department and the F.B.I. took very
aggressive action to recover the
stolen gold and bring the perpetrators
to justice. I'm happy to tell the
people of New York that the streets
are safe again.
CUT TO:
Vitti knocks on the front door.
Patty answers it in her
robe.
PATTY
Hi, Paul.
How'd it go?
VITTI
Not so good.
PATTY
Yeah, I heard. It's all over the
television. I never should've trusted
Eddie. But, you know, a woman alone
in the world is very vulnerable.
VITTI
Yeah, I know.
PATTY
At least I don't have to worry about
the Rigazzis no more. Thanks to you.
VITTI
I told you -- I just want to be left
118.
alone.
PATTY
I know. I'll make sure. How about
some breakfast? I could make you some
waffles and -- whatever else you want.
She adjusts her robe, providing Vitti a quick peek.
VITTI
Can't do that.
Patty smiles and shrugs.
PATTY
Well, if you ever change your mind --
(kisses him)
Good luck, Paul.
CUT TO:
Ben is leaning against the railing gazing at the water when
Vitti walks up.
BEN
Did you see Patti?
VITTI
Yeah.
BEN
(ruefully)
Did she grab your balls?
VITTI
What kind of question is that? She's
cool. She's just happy to have 'the
Wrench' out of the way.
BEN
Well, I talked to the U.S. Attorney.
VITTI
Did he grab your balls?
BEN
No, Paul, he did not grab my balls.
He thanked me for tipping him off
about the gold. And he said he won't
be coming after you if you stay out of
trouble.
So what do you think?
VITTI
I'm gonna go to Ohio -- get Marie and
the kids -- then we'll probably
disappear for awhile -- figure out all
119.
this future stuff
-- away from all the pressure.
BEN
Good idea. Change is hard, Paul.
But
you did the right thing.
VITTI
Yeah, you, too. You hung in there.
That took a lot of guts.
BEN
Well, I just --
VITTI
No, you were like an animal back
there.
BEN
I just vented my displaced aggression
VITTI
No. I'm telling you. You're a
monster. I saw the beast in you.
BEN
I'm not a beast. I can handle myself
if I have to --
VITTI
Handle yourself? You were fuckin'
John Wayne.
BEN
Well, I wrestled a bit in high school
-- 122 pounds.
VITTI
Yeah, I could tell.
You're good, you.
BEN
I'm not --
VITTI
Paul, I just --
VITTI
No. You are good. You got a gift, my
friend.
Ben gives up.
BEN
Fine.
I have a gift.
VITTI
So -- happy ending, huh?
120.
BEN
Well, I think so.
Don't you feel
better now?
VITTI
Are you kidding? I feel like shit.
All that work for nothing. 20 million
bucks.
BEN
You're grieving -- it's a process.
VITTI
Take it easy, Doc.
BEN
You, too, Paul.
They embrace. Then Vitti starts to walk away toward Jelly
who has been waiting at a respectful distance.
Vitti stops and turns.
VITTI
Hey, Doc!
