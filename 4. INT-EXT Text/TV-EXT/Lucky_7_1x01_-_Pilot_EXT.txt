street kiosks. Amidst the everyday bustle, we hear RUBBER 
ON ROAD! Suddenly, a PURPLE BENTLEY comes TEARING round a 
corner, in mid-chase, SCREECHING down the street- 



Antonio watches police cars race by up the on-ramp. He 
shakes his head and starts back in, but feels something, 
and looks up into... a rainfall of MONEY FLUTTERING DOWN 
all around him. He is engulfed - perplexed, mystified - 
 surreal. We TILT UP TO a sign: by the STORM OF CASH. It s

visages of Kennedy and Reagan plastered around his cab.

As Antonio and Nicky work to re-attach the hood of a 
truck, Nicky hears the rumble of a subwoofer, sees a 
tricked-out Escalade across the street. Two badasses - 
EDDIE and GRONK - lean against it, eyeballing him. 

NICKY 
Gimme a sec, will ya?

He goes, leaving Antonio struggling to hold up the hood-

They all turn to see Antonio, crow bar over his shoulder.

ANTONIO
'Cause I really need him back at work. 

EDDIE
Go on, Nicky. Go make us our money back.RICHMAN/ZABEL - LUCKY 7 - 1/27/13                        18.


They get in the Escalade and drive off, leaving Nicky 
rattled. As he walks back with Antonio-

ANTONIO
What was that about?

Nicky just looks away and heads back to work, frustrated.



Nicky pulls his old car up. Matt jumps out, rushes inside-



 on his Nicky holds gifts; flowers and a teddy bear. He s

Matt mops up, sweating, furtively eyeing security cams-

OUTSIDE, Matt stacks the folding sign. And as he brings 
it in, WE SHOOT DOWN THE STREET TO NICKY, walking toward 
the shop, a ski mask over his head. He enters the shop, 
pulling out a gun, coming up behind Matt -

Matt stuffs the money in the cereal box, and then - THE

ducks into the dark. Matt gets to his feet, just as Bob 
enters. Matt tries not to act nervous-

MATT
Hey, Bob. What s up?

BOB

Matt smiles. Bob turns to leave, but then -- HE STOPS -
noticing that pile of Cheerios scattered on the floor.

BOB (CONT D)

Before Matt can answer, Nicky panics, grabs a bottle from 
the gift crate of booze and SMASHES Bob over the head.

paramedics load Bob, unconscious, into an ambulance. 

ILENE
Thanks so much for coming, Denise.

Denise looks over and waves, reassuringly... to MATT, who 
sits in the open back of a cop car, watching them... 

MAN (O.S.)
Matt Korzak..?

Matt looks to find the man: DETECTIVE AL MINETTI (40s), 
who is genial and professional. Matt, however, has 
trouble avoiding getting tripped up by his own guilt. 

MINETTI

MATT

Denise and Leanne make their way, as they put on their 
uniforms, from the back to the front register. 

LEANNE 
Any more word on Bob?

DENISE 
Still in the coma. But Ilene thinks he 
heard her when she told him we won. 

LEANNE
What did Ted say when you told him? 

DENISE
 He got home late. I haven t.

Huh? But before Leanne can follow it up, they arrive at 
the register - Matt is there. Leanne goes through a 
pronounced change of demeanor, seeing him...

LEANNE
Are you okay? I heard the guy had a gun. RICHMAN/ZABEL - LUCKY 7 - 1/27/13                        45.

LEANNE

She puts her hand on his arm; like a warm blanket to him. 

LEANNE (CONT D)
If you need anything... somebody to talk 
to or anything... let me know.

He looks at her, their faces close. She seems so gentle, 
uncomplicated, compared to everything else. The air 
between them CRACKLES and then - Denise pops back in.

DENISE
Did you see Bob at the hospital? 

MATT
No, I tried, but... he was sleeping. 

LEANNE
 the nicest man ever. I hope they Bob s
find the guy that did this and string him 
up by the balls. 

Matt swallows hard, as Nicky steps up from the back as 
Samira is coming in to work. Awkward looks between them. 

NICKY
Is the lottery dude here yet? 

DENISE
Nope. Should be soon.
(then)
Hey, Samira. RICHMAN/ZABEL - LUCKY 7 - 1/27/13                        46.


SAMIRA
Hey, everybody.

Nicky smiles at her, hesitantly. She nods and looks away. 
Leanne pulls out a bottle of vodka. 

LEANNE
A quick little taste for us all to 
celebrate. And one extra one for Bob. 

As she fills shot glasses, we see, out the window -



 Antonio looks in as his co-workers raise a toast. He s
pleased for them, no doubt, but still it pains him. 

DENISE (INSIDE)
Cheers! 

Antonio turns and walks past the shop. Rounding a corner, 
he takes out his cell phone. INTERCUT WITH:



News vans, cameras, a crowd gathering, anticipation for a 
news conference building, while-



We find MINETTI, deep in the crowd. Even he marvels at 
the spectacle as our gang walks out to cameras and 
fanfare. At this moment, these regular folks are rock 
stars on this corner in Astoria, like the Beatles landing 
in America. The press shouts over the cheering crowd-

REPORTERREPORTER 2
 it feel to be rich?!How sWill you buy a house?!

REPORTER 3REPORTER 4
Will you quit your job?!Travel the world..?!

Amidst the chaos and questions, we PAN ACROSS our gang:

Matt is a little unnerved as he sees Minetti - Leanne 
turns her face away from the cameras - Nicky spots Gronk 
and Eddie, nervously avoiding their gaze... 

Samira has an eye on Nicky, but then looks out to her 
 dad, standing by his cab, smiling, and - oh no! - he s
got Vinod with him, an arm around his shoulder - Denise 
looks out and - to her surprise - SPOTS TEDDY, waving to 
her sweetly, innocently, from the crowd... 

From the din, one question rings out- 

REPORTER 5 (O.S.)
How do you feel, winning all that money?

And it catches them all off-guard, like a brand new 
thought: how do they feel? We return to Matt, who after a 
moment of pause, grins, convincing himself...

MATT
All in all... pretty damn lucky.

And off the group's various reactions, cameras FLASH! We 
FREEZE on the image, which morphs into a New York Post 
cover headline:  FILL 'ER UP! print: smaller in   And
 Astoria Gas Station Employees Hit a $45M Jackpot!
