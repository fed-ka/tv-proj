CLOSE ON Chuck, lost in thought, Brown Eyed Girl continues, 
although now heard through Chuck s iPod EAR BUDS.

VOICE (O.C.)
Yo, Chuck... 

REVEAL Captain Awesome, standing at the desk behind Chuck s 
back.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Chuck?  Chief?  Bro...? 

That s when Awesome spots the cord hanging from Chuck s ear. 
Awesome secretly picks his iPod off of the counter.  ANGLE ON 
IPOD: Jill  03 Mix.  Awesome reacts, then spikes the volume.

CHUCK
What the--!

Chuck yanks his earbuds out.  Then Chuck sees Awesome.

CHUCK (CONT D)
Thanks for the wake up call.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
I got another.  It s time to update 
your iPod.  How s the Jill  03 mix?

CHUCK
Gloomy and emasculating.  What s 
up, Devon?

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Speaking of iPods...  I sweated 
through mine on my morning jog.  
Stopped working.  Thought maybe you 
could fix it.

CHUCK
No problem.

Chuck gingerly picks up Awesome s  sweated through  iPod.

CHUCK (CONT D)
I ll get right on it --

VOICE (O.S.)
Actually, I m going to need you to 
get right on that tech support call 
at the conference center --

Chuck and Awesome turn, find Emmett.  He holds a box of 
donuts.

CHUCK
I m sorta... helping a customer.

EMMETT
Conference Center, Charles.  And 
pronto.

Chuck nods to Awesome, heads out --

EMMETT (CONT D)
(turning to Awesome)
One of our other nerds will be with 
you shortly.

Off Emmett heading towards Big Mike s office --


CUT TO Big Mike, at his desk.

BIG MIKE
Why, Emmett, you shouldn t have.

REVEAL Emmett, brown-nosing, handing Big Mike the donuts.

EMMETT
I couldn t help myself, sir.  Like 
you, deep fried breakfast pastries 
make me weak in the knees.  

BIG MIKE
Enchante.

Emmett watches as Mike digs into the donuts, shoving one into 
his mouth whole.  Emmett joins him.

EMMETT
Delicious.  You d never know they 
were whole wheat...

BIG MIKE
(blanching)
Whole what--?

Mike accidentally inhales the whole-wheat donut.  Chokes. CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             5.



BACK WITH AWESOME, waiting.  He looks around impatiently, 
checks his watch, when Emmett rushes out of Mike s office.

VOICE 
Is there a doctor in the house!


BACK WITH EMMETT as Mike comes staggering out of his office. 
Nearby, LESTER turns to JEFF.  The pair snap into action.

LESTER
You hold his mouth open, Jeff... 
I ll reach down and grab it.

The two jackasses go to work on Big Mike.

LESTER (CONT D)
Relax, Michael.  I ve got very 
slender fingers.

Just then, Awesome arrives, pushing them aside.  Awesome 
grabs Mike from behind and begins administering rhythmic 
thrusts.  By now, a SMALL CROWD has gathered.

Awesome gives Big Mike one final Heimlich move and the DONUT 
shoots from his mouth.  Sighs of relief, a few CHEERS, as 
Mike gives Awesome a grateful bear hug.

Lester and Jeff, watch from the wings, feeling upstaged.

JEFF
Guess his way works, too.

LESTER
A little showy, I thought.


A BANNER reads:  BIOSCIENCE CONFERENCE  08.   PAN to 
reveal... Chuck setting up a Powerpoint display in the 
amphitheater.  Several BUSINESS types mill about getting 
ready for the presentation.  Chuck explains to LONNIE (30 s 
hotel employee) how it all works.

CHUCK
Okay.  So you should be all set.  I 
got rid of the keystone effect.  
Here s your remote.  Just point and 
click and --

ANGLE ON ENTRANCE -- where a WOMAN enters.  She turns and we 
get our first good look.  The glasses.  The long, flowing 
brunette hair.  No.  It can t be.  Of all the conference 
centers in all the hotel chains... It s Jill Roberts. 

Chuck hits the floor.  Hides under the desk.  

LONNIE
(bending down)
Is there a problem?

CHUCK
Can you tell me if the attractive, 
brown-eyed, slightly egg-heady 
brunette with an extremely cold 
heart is still here?

LONNIE
She s here.  Why, who is she?

CHUCK
Jill Roberts, my ex girlfriend.  
Broke my heart.  I need a diversion. 
Would it be a terrible imposition 
for you to pull the fire alarm? 

SUDDENLY two high heels step into frame on the other side of 
the desk.  Chuck remains hidden -- too terrified to move.  He 
pulls his Nerd Herd badge off his chest.

JILL
(to Lonnie)
Hi.  Dr. Jill Roberts.  I need some 
help setting up my computer.

Chuck prays Lonnie has his back. 

LONNIE
Under the desk.

Jill bends down to look under the desk.  That s when she 
looks and sees... Chuck.  Knees to chest.  Hiding under the 
desk.  

JILL
Chuck?  Chuck Bartowski?

CHUCK
(climbing out; stands)
Do I know you...?

JILL
It s me, Jill!  Jill Roberts?  You 
don t recognize me?

CHUCK
(beat; fake realization)
Jill.  Of course.  How are you?  
It s so nice to see you.

JILL
You too.  How long has it been?

CHUCK
Five years, four months.  Ish.  
Give or take.  Somewhere in that 
neighborhood.  So, what are you up 
to?

JILL
After Stanford I got my PhD in 
Biomedical Engineering.  I m giving 
a presentation at the conference on 
infectious disease.  And you? 

Chuck considers his options.  Does what any self respecting-
heart-broken man would do: he lies.

CHUCK
... Still in the computer game. 
Work-slash-own a little company.  
Six... teen or seventeen I forget 
which, stores in the Southern 
California area.  Considering 
opening up a branch in Bangalore. 
Always need computers over there.  
Once in a while I do the install 
myself, don the uni, get my hands 
mussy.

What the hell is he talking about?

JILL
I m so happy for you.  Last time I 
saw you, you were working at a... 
Buy More?

CHUCK
Wonderful growing experience.  
Built character.  Wouldn t have 
changed it for the world.

A moment.  It s working.  Jill is totally impressed.

JILL
There s definitely some things that 
I would change.  Particularly about 
us --

Chuck s just about to hear words he s been dying to hear for 
five years when suddenly a man, DR. GUY LAFLEUR, 30 s, tall, 
handsome, swoops in on Jill...

GUY LAFLUER (O.S.)
Hello, darling.  There you are.
We re running late. 

JILL
Guy, this is my old friend Chuck 
Bartowski.  Chuck, my boss, Dr. Guy 
LaFleur.

Chuck offers his hand to shake.

CHUCK
Nice to meet you.

Guy ignores Chuck s hand.  Nods.  That s when it happens --

CHUCK FLASHES: SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS DEAD FROM A BIO-WEAPON; 
FRENCH INTEL DOCUMENTS LABELED  BIO-WEAPONS ; A LIQUID FILLED 
VIAL LABELED EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS; GUY WINNING AN AWARD.

GUY LAFLUER
(to Jill)
I m sure your friend s busy, has 
computers to fix.  Shall we?

Guy pulls Jill away, putting his arm around her waist.  He 
lets his hands slip a little too low.  Jill calls back -- 

JILL
I m staying at the Marina Marriot. 
Call me if you want to get a cup of 
coffee.  I ll understand if you 
don t.

Jill heads out.  Chuck waves.

CHUCK
Well, you know... busy.  May need 
to go to India.  Bangalore branch 
and all.  I ll talk to my people. 

Chuck watches as Jill Roberts walks out of his life.  Again.CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             9.



Casey and Sarah await instructions from GENERAL BECKMAN.  ON 
THE MONITOR -- A PHOTO of Jill receiving a diploma.  

Chuck paces in front of the monitor.  A wreck.

CHUCK
I panicked!  Totally panicked.  It 
was incredible how much she 
accomplished since Stanford.  A 
masters in Biomedical Engineering --

GENERAL BECKMAN
Actually it s a masters in 
Computational Chemistry from 
Stanford and her doctorate was 
Biomedical Engineering from Duke.

CASEY
Not bad.  What she ever see in you?

CHUCK
Okay, okay I get it.  She s turned 
out to be a huge success.  Is there 
a spy component here or am I the 
one being tortured?

NOW a PHOTO of GUY -- In a lab. 

GENERAL BECKMAN
Her boss, Guy LaFluer is the head 
research scientist for the European 
company BioPharma.  MI-6 has 
reports Guy may have developed a 
deadly bio-weapon which he plans to 
sell to the highest bidder.

CHUCK
(concerned)
Is Jill involved?

GENERAL BECKMAN
It s your job to find out, Chuck.  
Casey and Sarah will surveil Dr. 
LaFleur.  We need you to reconnect 
with Jill, find out what she knows 
about Guy.

CHUCK
When you say reconnect you mean, 
send her an e-mail?  Bring her into 
my Facebook circle?



(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             10.

CONTINUED:

GENERAL BECKMAN
Call her at her hotel and make a 
date.  See if you flash on anything 
she says or anyone you meet.

CHUCK
A date?  With my ex?  Terrible, 
idea, General.  Perhaps I ve 
misstated the nature of our 
relationship.  She broke my heart!  
Destroyed me!  Took all my 
confidence, my mojo -- 

CASEY
You had mojo?

CHUCK
I was on my way.  There was a 
public dumping, followed by an 
unfortunate drunk dialing 
incident... or two.  Oh, and did I 
mention she slept with Bryce?

CASEY
(eyes Sarah)
Who hasn t?

SARAH
Chuck, I know that Jill hurt you, 
but maybe seeing her again will 
give you the closure you ve always 
wanted.

CASEY
Or you can do your job and grow a 
pair, Bartowski.  Hurt is what 
happens when a grade 5 bio-weapon 
turns your guts into jelly.  
(then)
But look on the bright side, now 
you can get your Mojo back.

Casey slaps Chuck s back.  Off Chuck -- He s going to have to 
see Jill.  Again.

ACT ONE


Emmett addresses Chuck, Morgan, the Herd and RANDOM STAFF.

EMMETT
As you know we nearly lost our dear 
colleague and leader yesterday, and 
to what?  One tiny little donut. 

Morgan rolls his eyes, whispers to Chuck.

MORGAN
Please... Didn t we lose Big Mike 
to donuts years ago? 

EMMETT
I shudder to think how people like 
you would respond to an actual 
catastrophe.  Earthquake, fire --

LESTER
An all-out race war...

EMMETT
-- and that is why Michael and I 
have decided to implement an 
emergency preparedness course.

The crowd GROANS.  Chuck begins turning toward the door.

EMMETT (CONT D)
I m sorry... It seems Chuck has a 
better use for his time.

CHUCK
No... It s just...

EMMETT
Perhaps then I m boring you with 
this small matter of life and 
death?

CHUCK
Not that... I ve just already taken 
a class, Emmett.

EMMETT
And from whom did you receive this 
expert medical training, may I ask?




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             12.

CHUCK
From him...

Chuck points to the door.  REVEAL Awesome pushing his way 
inside with a PLASTIC CPR DUMMY under each arm. 

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Bueanos dias, class... 
(indicating CPR dummies)
Who s ready to pound some plastic?

ANGLE ON JEFF, raising his hand.  A perv-y little smile.  
Casey enters, indicates for Chuck to get going.  

CHUCK
You sure you want to do this?

CAPTAIN AWESOME
I love volunteer work, Chuck.    
Besides teaching CPR s a breeze.  A 
child could learn it.

CHUCK
(re: nerds)
Well, then you might have a shot.

Chuck heads out and joins Casey --

CASEY
Let s go, Romeo.  Time for your big 
date.

OFF Chuck, dreading this, fear in his eyes --

SMASH CUT TO:


Chuck, fear in his eyes, living room empty, creeps quickly to 
the door.  REVEAL Chuck s dapper as hell, wears an expensive 
CIA provided Prada-type suit.  Just as he thinks he s safe --  

The door opens.  Ellie.  She eyes his suit.  

ELLIE
Somebody have a big date?

CHUCK
No.  No big date.  Why?

ELLIE
Your suit.  It s new, right?  Looks 
expensive.



(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             13.

CONTINUED:

CHUCK
This?  No, no, cheap.  Big sale.  I 
had a coupon.

ELLIE
Well, I think it s very sweet you 
get all dressed up for Sarah.  
She s a very lucky girl.

This gets to him.  Stops in his tracks.  Turns around:

CHUCK
Elle, can I ask you a question?

ELLIE
Mm-hmm.

CHUCK
You ever think about... your ex-
boyfriend, Doug Wald?

Ellie puts down the journal.

ELLIE
No, not really.  Why?

CHUCK
Let s say you ran into Doug totally 
randomly and he asked you out to 
dinner to catch up on old times?  
What would you say?

ELLIE
Guess theoretically, I d say yes.

CHUCK
(wave of relief)
Wow.  I am so glad you said that.  
(big admission)
See, I m not going out to dinner 
with Sarah tonight, I m going out 
to dinner with Jill.

ELLIE
What?!  Jill!  No!  Absolutely not!  

CHUCK
Wait, but you just said that Doug --

CONTINUED: (2)

ELLIE
Forget what I just said.  There is 
no scenario where you going to 
dinner with the girl who dumped 
you, broke your heart and slept 
with your best friend is a good 
idea.  You bought a new suit --

CHUCK
Coupon...

ELLIE
Chuck, forget emotions, this is 
pure science.  Let s say you have a 
stable compound: we ll call it 
Chuck and Sarah.  And you introduce 
an unknown element: we ll call it 
Jill.  You might create a volatile 
substance which could blow up in 
your face.  So, you have to ask 
yourself: is it worth the risk?  

Off Chuck, hmm.  


Chuck stands in Sarah s apartment as she puts a bug on him.

CHUCK
I just want to go on record one 
more time; this is a bad idea.  

SARAH
(fixes his tie)
You ll do fine, Chuck.  You look 
great.

CHUCK
I should have worn an undershirt, I 
always break into a sweat around 
Jill.   

SARAH
What do you have to be nervous 
about?

CHUCK
Are you kidding?!  She s a 
Computational Bio-something, and 
I m a putz who still wears a pocket 
protector!

SARAH
Chuck, you re not a Nerd Herder 
tonight --

CHUCK
(mocking)
I know, I m really a super secret 
government asset.  Which she can t 
know, therefore does me no good 
when it comes to winning her back.  

Sarah considers this.  Even Chuck let it slip.

CHUCK (CONT D)
(covers)
Which is clearly not the intended 
purpose of this evening.  I am all 
business tonight.  Just there to 
see if I flash or whatnot. 

SARAH
You re gonna do fine, Chuck.  
You ve done a lot for your 
government.  Tonight, it s our turn 
to repay the favor.

Sarah smiles.  Chuck concerned.  What does she have in mind?


The place is PACKED.  Patrons waiting around the crowded 
hostess desk trying to get a table.  

The Maitre d (Casey) races over.

CASEY
Mr. Bartowski!  What a pleasure to 
see you again. I hope you haven t 
been waiting long.  Right this way.

CHUCK
(sotto)
Is everyone here CIA?

CASEY
But of course, sir!

TRACKING SHOT follows Chuck and Jill as they weave through 
the crowd.  Think: Copacabana scene from Goodfellas.  As they 
pass the piano -- the PLAYER gives Chuck a deferential nod.

PIANO PLAYER
Evening, Mr. Bartowski.

Casey SNAPS his fingers and a table is quickly placed in the 
center of the restaurant set with silverware, a lamp, candle.  
Like clockwork.

CHUCK
Thank you, Jonathan.

Chuck hands him a rolled up dollar bill.  Pats Casey s cheek.  
Not Casey s favorite moment in service of his country.

JILL
I m impressed, Chuck.  It s like 
you own the place.

CHUCK
No... Just an investor.  What can I 
say?  I m a sucker for a good veal 
parm.

The waitress arrives.  SARAH.  

SARAH
Good evening, Mr. Bartowski.  Can I 
get you two anything to drink?  The 
usual?   97 Les Fiefs de Lagrange?  




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             17.

CONTINUED:

CHUCK
Of course.  

Sarah takes off.  We see CASEY at the Maitre D s booth 
listening in to their conversation.  Sarah gets the wine, 
listens in also.

JILL
A usual?  Impressive.  To think I 
knew you when your favorite drink 
was strawberry Yoo-hoo. 

She smiles at Chuck, and he s taken back to the Stanford days.  

CHUCK
(quickly covering)
The salad days.  Remember them 
fondly.

JILL
I m really glad things turned out 
so well for you, Chuck.  After, 
well... what happened...

CHUCK
Yeah, about that.

JILL
We don t have to talk about it --

CHUCK
No.  We do.  I never stole those 
tests, Jill. 

JILL
Okay.  I believe you.

CHUCK
Sure now. Because I drive -- 
vaguely, a fine Italian automobile, 
can get a table at a crowded 
restaurant, have my suits tailored 
by --
(checks the breast pocket)
Someone in Thailand, I think.  But 
you didn t believe me when it 
counted.  When it mattered most.  

Things are getting a little hot.  Casey indicates for Sarah 
to hustle over --

CONTINUED: (2)

JILL
Maybe I should ve believed you, but 
what was I supposed to think at the 
time?  Bryce said you were 
cheating.  He was your best friend.

CHUCK
I guess Bryce made a very 
convincing argument since you 
dumped me and hopped right into his 
bed.  

JILL
Maybe this wasn t such a good idea, 
Chuck.  

Sarah arrives back at the table with the wine.  Pours it.  
She eyes Chuck, telling him to cool it.

SARAH
(to Jill)
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Bartowski.  
There s a call for you at the bar. 

CHUCK
Excuse me.  I ll be right back.

ANGLE ON BAR -- Sarah walks Chuck to the bar.  He holds the 
phone to his ear.  Pretends to speak into it -- really he 
talks with Sarah.  Casey s crossed over to them, too.

SARAH
What do you think you re doing?

CHUCK
Getting closure.  She owes me an 
explanation.

CASEY
No.  She doesn t.  She used her 
first amendment right to dump you 
so get over it.  Now get back in 
there and find out what Guy s 
planning to do.

Casey storms off.  

SARAH
I know it s hard, Chuck, but you 
need to be a spy first tonight.

CHUCK
It is hard.  I m not like you, 
Sarah.  I can t just turn my 
emotions on and off like some 
robot.

That hits harder than he intended.

CHUCK (CONT D)
I m sorry.  Totally uncalled for.  
I m not being myself tonight.  I 
guess I just want her to know she 
made a mistake.

Sarah indicates Jill at the table.  Still there.

SARAH
I think she knows, Chuck.  It s why 
she s still here.  Now?  Done 
feeling sorry for yourself?

CHUCK
I d like another ten, fifteen 
minutes of really pathetic self 
indulgence.
(Sarah smiles)
But, duty calls.  I m going back 
in.

He heads over.

SARAH
Stand up straight.

Chuck rights his posture.  Now sits back down with Jill.

CHUCK
Sorry about that.  No more 
interruptions.  Promise.  Oh, and 
by the way, you know that guy who 
was sitting here a couple minutes 
ago?  Looked like Chuck Bartowski?  
Was kind of whiny, bitter?   Turns 
out he was an imposter.  

JILL
Oh, really?  

CHUCK
Yeah.  Well, don t worry.  I Kung 
Fu d him in the bathroom and I 
promise you he won t be bothering 
you for the rest of the evening.

Jill smiles.  The old Chuck is back.  The one she fell for.

JILL
Good, cause I like the Chuck 
Bartowski sitting across from me 
now a whole lot better.

CHUCK
Me too.

OFF them smiling --


Chuck eats cereal.  He is not a happy man.  Ellie enters 
ready to leave for work.

ELLIE
Am I supposed to ignore you or can 
I ask a number of personal 
questions that you must answer.

Chuck plops down on the couch.  Spills:

CHUCK
You were right.  You re always 
right.  I never should've gone out 
with Jill last night.  

Ellie comes over, sits down next to him.

ELLIE
I don t know, Chuck.  Maybe I 
overreacted.  Maybe there was a 
reason to go to dinner with Jill.  

CHUCK
Yeah, to humiliate myself.  

ELLIE
The way things ended with her, 
you ve always had a million 
questions and no answers.  And now 
you ve got some.  

CHUCK
But so what?  What good did it do 
me to go poking around in my past?

ELLIE
Cause maybe, without all that 
wondering and what-iffing, you can 
finally close a chapter of your 
life and feel resolved about being 
in love with Sarah.  

If Ellie knew the half of it.  Chuck forces a smile.

CHUCK
Of course.  You re right again.CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             24.

Awesome s face falls as he pauses in the doorway.  MORGAN

stomach. 

 MORGAN
Work the body... Work the body...

PAN OFF OF MORGAN to REVEAL Jeff and Lester.  Each of them

MORGAN
Come again?

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Emmett didn t tell you about the

JEFF
Man, if I wanted to take tests, I 
woulda stayed in school.

LESTER
So, what happens if we don t pass?

JEFF
Or, fail, as it were?

MORGAN
We get a lousy job and live a 
small, under-realized life in the 
valley.  Oooo... Scary.

Jeff and Lester LAUGH in agreement.

VOICE (O.S.)
You get to take the 30 hour 
remedial course at the rec center, 
unpaid, and on your own time.

The room goes DEAD QUIET.  All eyes turn on Emmett who comes 
in from Mike s office, pours himself a dainty cup of coffee. 

EMMETT
Hmm... Well, that seemed to get 
their attention, doctor...

Off our guys s dread as Emmett saunters out.


Sarah and Casey sit inside the surveillance van.  Headphones 
on.  On a bank of monitors we see hallway shots.  Exteriors 
of Guy and Jill s rooms.  Also audio feeds.  Sarah takes her 
headphones off --

Guy just ordered room service.

Easy.  I come in peace.

CASEY
What the hell are you doing here?

CHUCK
Wanted to make sure Jill is all 
right.

SARAH
She s fine, Chuck.  Came home last 
night and hasn t left her room

CASEY
She s making a call --

Casey hits a button and we can hear it.  Problem is her voice 
is static.  Fuzzy.

CASEY (CONT D)
Damn.  Bug s on the fritz.

SARAH
We need a new one.  I ll go in as 
housekeeping and plant another. 

CASEY
She d recognize you as the waitress 
from the restaurant?  No, I ll 
tranq her.  She ll wake up in an 
hour, think nothing of it. 

CHUCK
Wait.  Hold on!  I ll go.  
Apologize for last night, she ll 
tell me what a big loser I am, and 
I ll plant the new bug.  No 
tranqing necessary.    

Sarah hands him the bug.

Put me down for ten -- with Casey. 
Alright.  I m going in...


Morgan enters, creeps to Chuck s doorway, peers out to make 
sure the coast is clear.  Now he scampers to Ellie s room. 


Morgan spots AWESOME S BAG on a dresser -- right next to a 
BASKET OF CLEAN LAUNDRY.  He begins rummaging though the bag. 
Can t find a test.  He accidentally KNOCKS OVER the laundry 
basket.  Now he notices a pair of ELLIE S PANTIES.  The sight 
can t help but give him pause.  He lifts them into the air.  
The Holy Grail... Then:

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Looking for something?

Awesome s at the doorway.  Holds the CPR TESTS.  Morgan hides 
the panties behind his back.  Starts to back out of the room.

CAPTAIN AWESOME (CONT D)
You didn t think I d just leave 
them in the bag for you, did you?

Ellie enters as Morgan is near the door...

CONTINUED:

ELLIE
Morgan...?  Are you holding my 
underwear?

MORGAN
(dropping the panties)
Of course not!  Now I want to be 
very clear about this: the only 
thing I came here to steal is a CPR 
test.  And any suggestion of 
anything pervy related to your 
panti..pant...underwear, is, 
frankly, outrageous.  

ELLIE
So you deny you re a perv but admit 
to being a thief?

MORGAN
At least I m being honest, right?

OFF Ellie pointing Morgan out and him leaving --


Chuck s at Jill s hotel door.  He takes a breath.  Looks down 
at the BUG in his hand.  Oh boy.  Chuck KNOCKS.  Waits.

JILL (O.S.)
Who is it?

CHUCK
It s the lying, yet well meaning 
fool who rented the Ferrari last 
night.

JILL (O.S.)
I don t want to talk to you, Chuck.

CHUCK
No problem.  I ll just sit out 
here, do all the work.  I know this 
will shock you but I want to say 
something absolutely crazy... The 
truth.  So, here it is.  I still 
work at a Buy More.  I still live 
with my sister. I m still best 
friends with Morgan, and I still 
have no idea what I m doing with my 
life.  That s who I am in a 
nutshell.  I guess I wanted you to 
think I was someone special.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
So, I lied and rented a car I 
couldn t drive, apparently I 
screwed up the transmission, and 
got a new suit, because from the 
second I saw you again I knew I d 
never really gotten over you 
Jill...
(deep breath; felt good)
So, there it is.  That s my life.  
There are some minor details I left 
out regarding video game 
accomplishments and my ability to 
quote movies on demand, but I think 
you get the picture.

Click.  A door opens.  Across the hall.  A LARGE, MIDDLE-AGED 
WOMAN opens her door.

MIDDLE- AGED WOMAN
Sugar, if she doesn t open up, I 
got a bubble bath running. 

CHUCK
That s very sweet.  Let me just 
play this hand out first.

CLICK.  Jill s door opens slightly.  The chain still on.  She 
peers through.  

JILL
Is that true?  You haven t gotten 
over me?

CHUCK
(deep breath)
No.

JILL
Get in here.

The chain comes off.  The door opens.  Bartowski is in.


ON MONITOR -- Sarah and Casey watch Chuck walk into the room.  
Sarah puts out her hand, wants Casey to pay up.  He 
begrudgingly hands her a ten spot.


Jill shows Chuck into the room.  Her science paperwork and 
binders lies about everywhere.

JILL
Sorry about the mess, I m still 
getting our lecture together.  

CHUCK
Yeah, you were starting to say last 
night.  Infectious disease or 
something.  I think you were 
speaking Aramaic?

Chuck hides the BUG in his hand.  Backs up towards the phone.

JILL
Not Aramaic, just simple BioChem. 
You should have studied harder.

CHUCK
Lot of good it would do me in my 
current line of work.

Chuck reaches back... the bug almost planted.... He puts it 
under the phone... Jill steps closer.

JILL
Stop it!

CHUCK
What?

JILL
Stop under-selling yourself.  
Chuck, there was a part of last 
night, somewhere after getting 
minor whiplash in the car and 
before abandoning you on the side 
of the road, when I had a really 
terrific time.

CHUCK
So did I.

JILL
And it wasn t because you had a 
 usual  drink, although that was a 
nice touch, it was because I 
remembered how much I loved 
spending time with you.

CHUCK
Really?





(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             32.

CONTINUED: (2)

JILL
Yes.  So no more lies.  No more 
deception.

CHUCK
No lies.  No deception...

She steps closer.  Chuck picks up the phone.  Smashes it down 
on the bug, squishing it.  

JILL
Good.  Do you know how much I 
missed doing this?

CHUCK
Doing what?

Jill pushes Chuck down on the bed.  Then, she kisses him...


Sarah lets Chuck back in the van with her and Casey.   Chuck 
has a perma-grin.  

SARAH
What happened in there, Chuck?  We 
lost radio contact.  

CHUCK
Oh, broke the bug.  It s broken.  
Sorry.

CASEY
Great work, Agent Imbecile.  Now 
what are we gonna do? 
(Chuck shrugs)
Why are you smiling?

CHUCK
She kissed me.  No spy work, no 
lies, mid-level Buy More 
employee... Just pure animal 
attraction.  She kissed me.

Suddenly, Chuck s expression changes.  He s seen something on 
a monitor.  A WAITER waiting for an elevator with a ROOM 
SERVICE CART.  OFF his TATTOO --

CHUCK FLASHES: CODE NAME: FOX DEN.  AN ASSASSIN SHOOTING A 
SILENCER INTO A VICTIM; SLITTING ANOTHER S THROAT; SNAPPING A 
NECK.  A BIOPHARMA COMPANY FILE WITH GUY S NAME ON THE 
HEADING.

CHUCK (CONT D)
That guy s some kind of assassin.  
Called Fox Den! 

MONITOR INSERT: Elevator doors open and Fox Den Assassin 
rolls his cart in.  Then presses for floor  12. 

CASEY
Twelve is Guy s floor. 

Sarah and Casey reach for their weapons...

SARAH
Chuck --

CHUCK
I know.  I know.  Stay in the van.

CASEY
And don t touch anything.

OFF Sarah and Casey rushing out --  


Guy works on his computer when the DOOR BELL RINGS.  He opens 
it, let s the WAITER/ASSASSIN in.  We ll call him ROMMELL. 

ROMMELL
Room service, sir.

GUY
Just put it down over there.

Guy goes back to work.  Doesn t notice Rommell lock the door 
behind him.  Rommell now suddenly attacks Guy.  He grabs him, 
starts CHOKING him.  Slams him hard against a window.  Guy 
struggles but is no match for Rommell.


As Chuck watches, via monitor, Casey and Sarah inside the 
elevator heading up to Guy s.  Now a CALL comes into Jill s 
room.  


Jill heads to the phone.  We see the squashed BUG come to 
life.

IN VAN: Chuck s not quite sure what to do.  Hears the 
dialing.  Picks up some HEADPHONES/HEADSET.  HITS a BUTTON.  
Listens --

SHARI (V.O.)
Shari.  It s Jill.

Chuck grimaces.  Mimics silently the name  Shari .

JILL (V.O.)
You re not gonna believe who came 
to my room to apologize.  Chuck.

SHARI (V.O.)
Please tell me you didn t let that 
loser in.

JILL (V.O.)
He was like a puppy dog.  I 
couldn t say no.  And I gotta 
admit, I still find him really 
cute.

SHARI (V.O.)
Cute?  He s a computer dork that 
makes ten bucks an hour.

CHUCK
Oh, come on.  I make twelve seventy 
five.

Beat.  

JILL (V.O.)
Chuck?  

Chuck looks around.  Did the button he hit flip off the mute 
switch?

JILL  (V.O.) (CONT D)
Chuck, are you on the phone?

CHUCK
(meekly)
No.  

JILL (V.O.)
What s going on?  Did you tap into 
my phone line?  Chuck, I m calling 
security.  Goodbye.  

The phone hangs up.  Chuck, once again, humiliated.


Casey and Sarah exit the elevator and rush down the hallway 
towards Guy s room.  They try the door.

SARAH
It s locked on the inside.

Casey backs away from the door.  Puts his shoulder down and 
rushes.  BAM.  The door doesn t budge.  Casey s shoulder 
aches.  He grimaces.  


Rommell still choking Guy.  It s taking longer than he hoped 
so he backs away from the window.  Takes a running start and 
tosses Guy through the window.  The glass breaks and Guy 
BLASTS out into a free-fall.


Casey hears the crash.  Shoulder still aching.

CASEY
Screw this...

Casey takes out his gun.  Fires at the lock.  BANG.  BANG.  
BANG.  Casey KICKS in the door --


Casey and Sarah rush into the room.  The windows broken.  Guy 
and Rommell gone.


Chuck is still stunned from the turn of events.

CASEY (V.O.)
Chuck, Guy is not in his room.  You 
have eyes on him?

Now, just as Chuck s about to respond we hear a BAM, THUMP as 
something hits the roof.  Now Chuck sees Guy s dead body 
slide down onto the windshield.  His eyes facing Chuck.

CHUCK
Yeah.  Both of them...

OFF Chuck --


END OF ACT TWOCHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             36.


ACT THREE


CLOSE ON used tissues.  A stack of them.  Crumpled on the 
table in Castle.  Casey grabs another Kleenex and hands it to 
a grieving Jill. 

CASEY
Let it all out.

JILL
(though tears)
Thank you.

She BLOWS her nose.  Hands the spent tissue to Casey.  He 
GLARES into the mirror where --


CHUCK and SARAH watch behind the TWO-WAY MIRROR.

CHUCK
I feel terrible.  Maybe I should go 
in there?  Console her.

SARAH
She can t know you re a spy, Chuck.

CHUCK
Of course.  She has to think I m a 
stalker.

SARAH
She doesn t think you re a stalker.

BACK IN INTERROGATION ROOM:

Casey sprays disinfectant on the table.

CASEY
Why do you think Guy was killed?  
What was he working on?

JILL
How do I know I can trust you?  
What is this place?

CASEY
CIA compound.  We ve been following 
you for days, Ms. Roberts.




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             37.

CONTINUED:

JILL
Following me?  Why?

CASEY
We thought your boss Guy was into 
some shady business.  We kept an 
eye on you as well to protect you.

Casey tosses some SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS on the table of Guy.  
Some of Jill.  One is her on a date with CHUCK.  CLOSE ON: A 
PHOTO of Jill and Chuck smiling.

JILL
That s my ex-boyfriend, Chuck.  Is 
he involved?  He s acting really 
bizarre.  One minute he seems so 
normal and the next... he s this 
total lunatic...

SARAH (O.S.)
She didn t say stalker.

JILL
... Almost like a stalker.

CASEY
It can be a pattern with these 
losers.  Once a pretty girl smiles 
at them, they become infatuated.  
I ve seen it a million times.

Casey winks into the mirror.

CASEY (CONT D)
So, your boss...

JILL
He was working on a cure for 
Malaria and during his research he 
accidentally invented a bio-weapon.  
A poison so deadly, it could kill a 
person within an hour if it gets 
into the blood stream.  It smells 
like wet dog, for some inexplicable 
reason, because it s made of 
dequalinium salt wherein said 
dequalinium salt is selected from 
the group consisting of an acetate, 
chloride bromide and iodide.

ON SARAH and CHUCK:

SARAH
You understand any of that?

CHUCK 
No.  But what a brain though, huh?  

BACK INSIDE:

JILL
One day some men showed up. They  
wanted the chemical composition.  
Of course, Guy refused.  

CASEY
Could you identify them?

JILL
No.  Guy ushered them out of the 
lab before I could get a good look.  
I do remember one having a tatoo.

CASEY
Like this?

He shows her a PHOTO: of Fox Den tatoo on ROMMELL.

JILL
Yes.  How did you know?

CASEY
Lucky guess.  Special forces tatoo.

JILL
Guy was going to announce the 
compound and the antidote at the 
convention so that it could never 
be used as a Bio-Weapon.  I guess, 
it s up to me to do it now.

CHUCK (O.S.)
No!  It s too dangerous.  Casey!!

Chuck POUNDS on the TWO WAY MIRROR.  Casey stares DAGGERS.

JILL
Um... Your window is knocking.

CASEY
Excuse me.


Casey barges in.

CASEY
What?!

CHUCK
She s not going to the conference. 
Fox Den will kill her.

CASEY
She has to.  It s the only way to 
smoke out the assassin.

CHUCK
(imploring)
Sarah, please don t do this.  If 
you ever want me to flash, 
Intersect or otherwise participate 
in any other government sponsored 
bad guy missions, you will not let 
her give this presentation.

Sarah takes a deep breath.

SARAH
... Fine.

CHUCK
(deep sigh)
Thank you.  I appreciate it.

SARAH
You go to work.  Don t worry about 
Jill.  I ll give the presentation.

Sarah walks away.  Off Chuck... Not exactly what he wanted...


Casey stands at the front of the room, near the stage.  
Sarah: her hair tied back in a bun; glasses on, very 
professorial.  They wear EARWIGS.  SCIENTISTS enter.  They re 
WANDED by SECURITY to ensure no weapons get in.  

CASEY
Anything?

SARAH
(scans room)
All good so far.

LONNIE
Please take you seats?  Giving the 
presentation for Dr. Lafleur will 
be his associate, Dr. Eva Anderson.

SARAH
(deep breath)
Looks like I m up.

CASEY
Nervous?

SARAH
Don t like speaking in front of 
large crowds.

Sarah takes the stage.  Taps the microphone.  

ONE SCIENTIST makes it through security.  He looks completely 
normal but at closer look we see he s ROMMELL in disguise.  
(He has a mustache and beard, glasses and a wig.)  

SARAH (CONT D)
(Australian accent)
G day, I m here to talk to you 
about a deadly poison that could 
change the course of human science.
(stalls)
... But first I just want to thank 
the Bonaventure Conference Center 
for hosting this wonderful event.  
The buffet was superb.

ON ROMMELL taking a seat.  Pulls a VIAL out of his pocket.  
Removes the top.  A thin MEMBRANE type substance holds the 
VIRUS in.  Rommell starts to leave.  As he does we see the 
MEMBRANE slowly smoking away. 

Scientists SNIFF.  Casey eyes the commotion.  Notices smoke 
coming from under the chair.  

CASEY
(sniffs)
Wet dog.
(into watch)
The poison has been released.  
Don t inhale!  

Sarah sees ROMMELL moving to the door.  Takes a deep breath. 

SARAH
(into microphone)
Excuse me for one moment.  Have to 
use the loo.

Sarah LEAPS from the stage and races to the exit.  Casey eyes 
the VIAL as the membrane is gone.  Death escaping.

Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a CIA 
emergency!  No one, I repeat no 
one, gets in or out.


Rommell removes his disguise as he rushes up the stairwell.  
Behind him, stuffed under the stair is the DEAD SCIENTIST he 
impersonated.  Bullet hole between the eyes.  

Sarah rushes into the stairwell, climbs up after him.


Morgan, Lester and Jeff stand around the break room table, 
anxious.  Morgan checks his watch. 

MORGAN
Where is he?

LESTER
Morgan, if he doesn t show -- 

EMMETT
If who doesn t show?

Reveal Emmet walking in with Awesome, to administer the test. 

EMMETT (CONT D)
The perennially tardy Chuck? I 
suggest you all worry about 
yourselves instead.  Dr. Woodcomb, 
if you ll distribute the tests.

Awesome begins handing them out, as Chuck hurriedly enters. 

CHUCK
Hi. Sorry I m late.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
You re right on time, bro.

Chuck sits down at the table.  The guys make a mad dash to 
sit next to him.  Elbows fly.  Morgan uses a swim move to get 
past Jeff.  Grabs a seat on one side of Chuck.  Lester gets 
the seat to the other side, until Jeff hip-checks him off.

EMMETT
You will have one hour to take the 
test.  You may begin... Now.

Lester puts on a hat with a long brim and sunglasses.  Morgan

Morgan, Jeff, and Lester follow.  Synchronized cheating. 
Until... 

Chuck s CELL PHONE BUZZES.  It s Casey.  Chuck has to take it.

CHUCK
Sorry but I need to take this call. 
It could be important. 

EMMETT
And this isn t?  No leaving the 
room during the test!

Chuck walks away from the table. The guys are frozen. 


Casey at the conference.  We see scientists starting to feel 
the effects of the virus: COUGHING, SWEATING, etc.

CHUCK
(trying to be quiet)
Casey?  Everything okay?

CASEY
Our Fox Den friends released the 
poison.  Sarah got out, but I m in 
here with the rest of the 
scientists.  We have an hour, maybe 
less.

CHUCK
To what?

A SCIENTIST COUGHS on Casey.  Gross.

CASEY
To live, idiot.  You have to get to 
Jill.  See if she has an antidote!

CHUCK
I don t think she wants to see me --

CASEY
Chuck!  We re dying here!  I don t

Well, it seems we already have one 
failure.  Let s hope none of you add 
to that number.  Half hour left.

Emmett grabs Chuck s test.  Morgan, Lester and Jeff try and 
steal a last glance, then watch it go, like a fading star. 
Shit.  Now what? 


Chuck at Jill s door, BANGING on it. 

CHUCK
Jill!  It s Chuck.  Please, open 
up!

JILL (O.S.)
Go away, Chuck!  This isn t funny

CHUCK
It s an emergency, Jill.  I

is at an all-time low but I need 
you to believe me... The Bio-Weapon 
has been released in the conference 
center. 

The door opens.  Chain still on it.  Jill pops into frame.

Now.

JILL
Chuck, I m calling the police --

CHUCK
I already took the liberty.  Open 
the door, Jill.

Jill closes the door.  Shit.  Chuck shakes his head.  What is 
he going to do?  Slowly, Jill opens the door.  She looks down 
the hall where lined along the hallway, are a BATTERY OF 
POLICE OFFICERS; CDC PERSONNEL; FBI AGENTS.  She s stunned.

JILL
Oh my God... You are telling the 
truth.

Jill disappears back into the room.  Comes out with a 
briefcase.  Chuck offers his hand.  Jill takes it.

JILL (CONT D)
Okay, what now?

CHUCK

Just stay with me.

He leads her down the hall.

ACT FOUR


Chuck and Jill make their way through the lobby which has now 
been sealed off.  Jill has a MEDICAL BRIEFCASE with her.  CDC 
AGENTS and EMERGENCY PERSONNEL in crisis mode mill about 
outside the ballroom.  All wear Haz-Mat suits.

CHUCK
Who s in charge here?

MED TECH
I am.

CHUCK
(swipes walkie)
Not anymore.

Jill s impressed as Chuck strides towards the Ballroom.

JILL
You really are a spy.  Wow...

CHUCK
The school boy charm and Buy More 
cover fools  em every time.  But 
underneath this dork suit I m one 
brave, brave man.  

They ve approached the entrance to the Ballroom.   Chuck 
stops.  Motions to Jill to give him a moment --

CHUCK (CONT D)

Casey.  It s Chuck.  I m here with 
Jill.  What s your twenty, good 
buddy?
(to Jill)
Spy lingo...


The ballroom looks like a warzone.  SCIENTISTS passed out on 
the floor.  Breathing, but losing time.  The only one with 
their wits is Casey, who s seen better days.  Sweating, weak. 

CASEY
This isn t a CB, moron.

By my time, we got fifteen minutes.CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             46.



Jill opens her MEDICAL CASE.  Inside is a VIAL.

JILL
How many people are in there?

CHUCK
(into mic)
Casey, what s the head count?  Over.

CASEY
Say around sixty eggheads.  And me. 

Jill looks concerned.  

JILL
It won t work.

CHUCK
What?  What do you mean?

JILL
I was going to take it myself, but 
that much antidote will require a 
host that s at least 170 pounds.  

Chuck looks around the room.

CHUCK
Who are we gonna get?  I m the only 
one I see who weighs that much.

Jill misinterprets this as Chuck volunteering.

JILL
You are so brave!  I ll talk you 
through it on the walkie.

CHUCK
Me... Wait, Um.. Maybe we should 
find another source so I could 
manage things from out here --

JILL
Inside the briefcase, is a MEDI-

need to extract 60 cc s of your 
blood.  Then inject 1 cc into all 
those infected.

Chuck opens the briefcase.  Inside is an ODD GUN LIKE SYRINGE 
and HYPODERMIC NEEDLES.  Where a mag would go is a CLEAR 
VIAL.  The needles start small and get really (scary) big.

CHUCK
Actually, I m not big on needles. 

Casey GRINS as he puts a MASSIVE NEEDLE onto the syringe gun.

CHUCK (CONT D)
Oh, god...

CASEY
Trust me, Chuck.  This is gonna

me...

Chuck closes his eyes as Casey readies to stab him.

ON JILL.  She hears Chuck whimper/cry...

JILL
Chuck, are you crying?

BACK ON: CHUCK AND CASEY.  Casey removes 60 cc s and Chuck is 
crying.  But he covers...

CHUCK
Happy tears... I just love saving 
lives.  Chokes me up every time.

Casey s vision begins to blur.  His knees are weak --

CASEY
Chuck, take the gun.  

Chuck turns around but he s too slow.  The gun drops out of

And you all have yet to attempt the 
Heimlich section.

The guys look at each other.  They re screwed.  Only one 
option left... Lester coughs to Morgan.  Morgan nods.  Morgan 
removes his pen cap.  Slides it to Lester.  Lester passes the 
pen cap to Jeff.  Jeff shakes his head.  No way!  Lester and 
Morgan nod, yes way. They have no choice.  It must be done...

Jeff sighs, relenting to his fate.  He brings the cap to his 
lips, puts it in his mouth, and... swallows.  Seconds later 
his face goes white.  He CHOKES. 

MORGAN
(loudly, for show)
Oh my God!  I think he swallowed a 
pen cap.

Awesome and Emmett rush over to Jeff.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Jeff, can you speak?

EMMETT
Are you choking?

CONTINUED:

Awesome performs the HEIMLICH on Jeff.  Morgan and Lester 
watch intently, using the demonstration to answer the 
questions on their tests. 

DING!  As Emmett s timer goes off, the cap flies out of 
Jeff s mouth.  Morgan and Lester drop their pens. 

MORGAN/ LESTER
Done!!


Chuck stands over a slowly expiring Casey.  Chuck surrounded 
by dying men and women.

CHUCK
Jill, what s going on?  


Jill on the Walkie.  Technicians are running around. 

JILL 
Chuck, hang in there, we re still 
trying to find another syringe gun. 

ON CHUCK.  Casey really really weak now.

CHUCK
What are we gonna do, Casey?

CASEY
Think of something.  You re smart.  
You went to Stanford.  Sort of.

CHUCK
I was a computer science major.  I 
don t know anything about bio-med.

A SCIENTIST back against a wall, SNEEZES on Casey.

CASEY
Hey!  Mind covering your mouth?  
Disgusting.

Chuck stares.  An idea.  

CHUCK
Casey this is gonna sound crazy but 
viruses are spread airborne, right?  
You catch them when someone 
sneezes.  Coughs.  Saliva...




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             52.

CONTINUED:

CASEY
Yeah?

CHUCK
Well, maybe the antivirals 
metabolize in saliva?  

CASEY 
What are you talking about?

CHUCK
I can t believe I m doing this...

Chuck puckers and licks his lips.  Moves towards Casey.  
Grabs him by the back of his head. 

CASEY
No, no, no...

Casey in his weakened state tries to fight him off, but he 
can t.   Chuck moves his mouth closer to Casey s.

CASEY (CONT D)
I served my country with honor, 
Bartowski.  Please.  Let me die 
with my dignity.

CHUCK
Trust me.  This is gonna hurt me a 
lot more than it hurts you.

Chuck now KISSES Casey.  A wet sloppy one.  As they kiss --

JILL (O.S.)
Chuck?  What are you doing?

Chuck turns.  Reveal Jill has entered the room in a Hazmat 
suit.  She has a new ampule for Chuck s gun and a second gun.

CHUCK
Jill... I thought maybe the anti-
virals could be spread by saliva.  

JILL
That s ridiculous.  Explains why 
you failed BioChem.

Casey GROWLS.  Chuck turns to Casey -- 

CHUCK
First let me say I m sorry, from 
the deepest recesses of my soul.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Second, if we survive this, I have 
a sister who needs me.

JILL
We need to make more antidote, 
Chuck.  I m gonna take some blood.

CHUCK
Be gentle...

Jill gives Chuck the shot.  Removes 60 cc s from Chuck again.  
Now another.  Both have syringe guns now.

JILL
I ll take half the room you take 
the other.  1 cc each.  Hurry.

OFF them rushing off, a team --


The CDC wait anxiously outside the ballroom s sealed doors.  
The place is entirely sealed off.  Contained.

Sarah enters from the far side of the room.  She s watching 
from afar.  

Then, striding out of the Ballroom, Chuck appears.  Followed 
by Jill in Hazmat suit.  He s trailed by Casey and the other 
scientists.  The CDC team ROARS with joy!  Disaster avoided.  

Chuck basks in the glory for a moment.  Sees Sarah in the bg, 
she smiles.  He smiles back. 

Now Jill takes off her Hazmat suit s helmet.  Turns to Chuck.

JILL
You did it, Chuck.  You re amazing.

CHUCK
It was nothing.  Just another day 
at the office.

But it wasn t nothing.  And finally someone knows he s not 
just some schmuck in a Buy More.

Now Chuck moves in.  KISSES her.  A long deep kiss.  OFF 
Chuck and Jill kissing, happy, Sarah watching from afar --

ACT FIVE


Casey and Sarah have BECKMAN on the big screen.

CASEY
Jill Roberts now knows Chuck s an 
asset.  What do you want us to do 
about that?

GENERAL BECKMAN
I want you to do nothing.

Casey s confused.  So is Sarah.

GENERAL BECKMAN (CONT D)
The assassin Agent Walker shot was 
a member of Fulcrum.  We don t know 
the extent of their penetration..  
If Jill knows something they may 
make a play for her.

CASEY
You want to use her as bait?

Sarah doesn t.  She s not sure this is a great plan.

SARAH
General, Chuck has real feelings 
for Jill.  I don t think he d 
approve of us using her like this.

GENERAL BECKMAN
That s why you re not going to tell 
him, Agent Walker.  

OFF Sarah, worried about using Chuck as bait --


Shift ending, Emmett is addressing the staff. 

EMMETT
Congratulations, everyone passed 
the test... fifty one percent is 
passing except Charles, who decided 
he had better places to be, so 
he ll have to take a remedial 
course.  Thirty hours of private 
tutoring.  

Big Mike walks out. 



(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             55.

CONTINUED:

BIG MIKE
That s the good news.  Bad news is 
this store has gotten a few more 
complaints than usual so Corporate 
has decided we ve all got to take a 
sexual harassment seminar. 

JEFF
(to Lester)
That s one test I don t need to 
study for. 

Jeff and Lester fist bump.  Chuck spots Casey -- heads over.

CHUCK
Casey.  Hope you re not still sore 
about the kiss thing.  
(Casey growls)
Not my proudest moment either but 
your lips are surprisingly supple.

Casey throws him against the wall.

CASEY
I will end you now --

CHUCK
Easy, easy.  Sister, remember?

Casey releases.  Walks off.  Chuck follows.

CHUCK (CONT D)
So say I wanted to possibly date 
Jill.  Could I do that even though 
she knows I m an asset? 

CASEY
As long you maintain your cover 
with Sarah and Jill doesn t know 
about that thing in your noggin... 
I think we can hold off on the kill 
and decease order.  

CHUCK
So you re saying I can pursue a 
real relationship with Jill, but it 
has to be kept a secret so everyone 
thinks I m still dating Sarah?

CASEY
Welcome to dating in the CIA.

OFF Chuck, nothing is ever easy --CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             56.



Ellie s watching TV as Chuck enters, spring in his step.  He 
puts down his keys.  She pauses the TV.

ELLIE
That s something I haven t seen on 
you for awhile --

CHUCK
(off his shirt)
What, this?  I wear it, like, four 
times a week --

ELLIE
No.  A smile.  You look so happy.

CHUCK
Oh.  That.  Yeah.  
(can t contain a smile)
I guess I found those answers you 
said I was looking for.

ELLIE
Oh, thank god.  I can t tell you 
how relieved I am.  There s 
something about Sarah, call it 
sisters intuition, I just know 
she s  the one. 

CHUCK
 The one,  huh.  Like Awesome is 
for you?

Ellie loves this.  Assumes he s referring to Sarah.

ELLIE
That s right. Devon is the one for 
me, and I guess you needed to go 
through all that stuff with Jill to 
figure out who the one is for you.  
Cause, Chuck, once you know you ve 
found the one, you stop wondering 
about someone else.

Chuck s phone RINGS.  He looks at the phone, smiles.  Waits a 
beat before answering.  Ellie gets it, he wants privacy.

ELLIE (CONT D)
Oh, sorry.  Tell Sarah I said 
hello.

CHUCK
(the lies begin)
Sure.  Thanks, Ellie. 

As Ellie walks out, Chuck reveals the FACE of his RINGING 
IPHONE: it s JILL.

JILL (V.O.)
So how s my favorite secret agent?

CHUCK
(into phone)
Good.  Just have to study for a CPR 
class for my day job at the Buy 
More.  I could use some help with 
the mouth to mouth...

JILL
What about your  cover  girlfriend?  
Won t she be jealous?  

CHUCK
Our relationship s a cover.  There s 
nothing to be jealous about.

JILL
So all this time... everything you 
pretended to be is fake.  That 
sounds really lonely, Chuck.  

CHUCK
It is.  It was hard for me but 
Sarah s a pro.  She can handle it.  


REVEAL SARAH at the bank of monitors watching/listening to 
Chuck and Jill.  

CHUCK
So... about that mouth to mouth...

OFF Sarah, listening to a happy Chuck and Jill, it s not so 
clear she can handle it --
