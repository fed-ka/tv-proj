  ACT 1, SCENE A                                     (1)     
  (NATHAN, RAY, JUNE, ZACHARY) 

  ACT 1, SCENE B                                     (4)     
      (NATHAN, RAY, JUNE, ZACHARY)

      THROUGH THE LENS OF A NEWS CAMERA, WE SEE A SIX-YEAR-OLD*
      BOY WALKING DOWN THE STREET, WEARING A SANDWICH BOARD
      THAT READS, "I HAVE A FILTHY MOUTH".  THE CAMERA PANS OFF
    OF THE BOY AND UP TO NATHAN MILLER HOLDING A MICROPHONE.

                                      NATHAN1

                    ...While this type of discipline seems

                    unorthodox to some, not everyone in

                    the neighborhood sees this as cruel

                    and unusual punishment. 

      NATHAN PUTS THE MIC IN FRONT OF AN OLDER WOMAN, JUNE.

                                      JUNE2

                    It's about time his parents did

                    something.  I'd like to see his jackass

                    brother wearing a sign that says, "I

                    say mean things about mature women's

                    breasts."

      THE WOMAN ADJUSTS HER BREASTS.

                                      NATHAN 3

                    (TO CAMERA)  Apparently, gravity is

                    not the only one who can be cruel.

      NATHAN LOOKS TO THE LEFT OF THE CAMERA.

                                      NATHAN (CONT'D)4

                    Alright, let's wrap it up.

    WE ESCAPE THE LENS OF THE NEWS CAMERA TO SEE IT'S BEING
      HELD BY RAY THOMPSON.  NATHAN WALKS OVER TO THE NEWS VAN,
      AND RAY FOLLOWS HIM.      "The Unauthorized Greg Garcia Pilot"  2.*

                    Come on, have one little party.  I'll*

                    invite some girls over.  You didn't*

                    divorce Janice so you could sit alone*

                    in your house every night.  *

                                      NATHAN6

                    Actually, that's exactly why I divorced*

                    her.  And it's amazing.  I haven't*

                    talked about my feelings or been forced*

                    to eat quinoa for three months. *

                                      RAY7*

                    No wonder you broke up.  You gotta*

                    eat the quinoa sometimes.  Keep your*

                    lady happy.*

                                      NATHAN8*

                    You know quinoa's a food, right?*

                                      RAY9*

                    Yeah, it's high in anti-oxidants.  *

                                      NATHAN10*

                    Look, I'm just not ready to jump back*

                    into the dating game.*

                                      RAY11*

                    Nate, you're on TV and you're wasting*

                    it.  *

                    You think when I was on assignment

                    with Geraldo in Afghanistan, he wasn't

                    using his celebrity status to get

                    some Mid-East tail?  He'd be back at

                    the hotel making it rain burkas. 

                    Burkas all over the damn place.  Burkas

                    hanging off the balcony, draped over

                    the shower curtain rod...  He'd walk

                    through the lobby looking for a bucket

                    of ice, butt-naked except for a burka

                    wrapped around his neck like a cape.  

                                      NATHAN12

                    You're telling me Geraldo Rivera slept

                    with a lot of Afghani women?

                                      RAY13

                    Well, I don't know for sure 'cause

                    they put him in a different hotel

                    than me.  But if he didn't, he's a

                    fool just like you.  

      NATHAN THINKS FOR A BEAT.*

                                      NATHAN14*

                    Fine.  I'll have a party.  Invite*

                    some girls.  Maybe it's time to get*

                    back on the horse.

                                      RAY15*

                    Giddy-up now.

                                                                              CUT TO:      "The Unauthorized Greg Garcia Pilot"  4.
