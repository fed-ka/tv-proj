      Van Pelt and Rigsby approach a rundown building.  A SIGN says 
      it s the CARELLA GARDENS COMMUNITY CENTER.  From inside comes 
      the SOUND of SINGING.


      Van Pelt and Rigsby walk back toward their car.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Seems clean, but we should keep an 
                    eye on him, don t you think?

      Rigsby doesn t say anything, lost in his thoughts.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    You okay?   

                                  RIGSBY
                          (snapping out of it)
                    Sure.  Why wouldn t I be? 

                                  VAN PELT
                    You re being quiet.  Like 
                      something s bugging you.  Was it 
                    LaRoche?

                                  RIGSBY
                    No.

      He gets in the car.  Van Pelt looks at him, sensing 
      something s wrong.

      A rundown building in a rundown neighborhood.  Artash steps 
      out into the parking lot with Lisbon.

                    Fight fixing: what can you tell me?

                                  ARTASH
                    Doesn t happen.  Like I told 
                    Charlotte -- it s not financially 
                    viable in this day and age.
                    She d been reading about past fixes 
                    in boxing, wanted to know if it 
                    exists in MMA.  It doesn t.

                                  LISBON
                    How come?  

                                  ARTASH
                    The Board finds out about a fixed 
                    fight, everybody involved is done, 
                    forever.  So first, there s that.  
                    Second, you need a fighter willing 
                    to take a dive.  

                                  LISBON

                    He d never agree to such a thing.

                    How d he get along with Charlotte 
                    Mitchell?

                                  ARTASH
                    He resented her a little, I think.  
                    He wanted her to portray him as a 
                    good guy and she wasn t buying it. 

                                  LISBON
                    He s not a good guy?

                                  ARTASH
                    Flacco s the good guy, Rowdy s the 
                    villain.  That s how we sold the 
                    fight, because that s who they are. 
                    Manny s a sweetheart, Rowdy s a 
                    natural jerk.

                    I don t know, the way he acted 
                    around her.

                    Coarse, lascivious, like it would 
                    be a bad idea to let him get her 
                    alone. 


      DAWN KERR (30 s) stands in the crosswalk outside the school 
      wearing a blaze orange vest and carrying a stop sign.

      She hurries the kids across the street with cheerful 
      scolding.  Rigsby and Cho approach.

                    Dawn Kerr?  We need to talk.

      He shows her his badge.

      INTERCUT WITH:


      A working garage facing a large courtyard in the back alley 
      of a working class Oakland neighborhood.  Several CUSTOM CARS 
      and BIKES are being worked on, one with its engine on a 
      hoist.  A dozen ROUGHNECK GEARHEAD type men and a few 
      women(20/30 s) are sitting around, playing dominoes and 
      drinking, working on the cars.  MUSIC is BLARING.  Rigsby and 
      Cho approach the domino players, and show their badges to one 
      of them -- FRANK LOPEZ -- a neighborhood shotcaller.  (40 s). 
      He s had a couple beers and he s in a good mood.   

                                  CHO

                    CBI?  I never have been questioned 
                    by the CBI. 

      Lopez moves his chin and two guys vacate their seats to give 
      Rigsby and Cho some place to sit.  They sit.

      Lopez nods affirmatively, unaware of Cho and Rigsby s 
      skepticism.

                    That place Narcissus -- you know 
                    it?  There was a scuffle.  I had to 
                    run out of there after some punk, 
                    and next time I look, the nine was 
                    gone.  It was a sweet gun, but what 
                    can you do? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Uh-huh.  Where were you two nights 
                    ago?

      Now Lopez notices Rigsby s skepticism, seems even more 
      amused.

                    I was here.  Any of these guys can 
                    tell you.  Don t believe me, lie 
                    detect me.  I ain t worried.

      Lopez goes back to his game.  Rigsby follows Cho, who s 
      reading a text message off his phone.

                    That guy LaRoche.  He wants to talk 
                    to me.  Wants me to come in.  

      Rigsby reacts with alarm.  Cho doesn t notice.  Glances at 
      Rigsby.  

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    What d he talk to you about?

                    Okay, the thing is, I have to tell 
                    you something.  I should ve before, 
                    but I didn t.  Here goes.

                    Yeah, I said he was with me at the  
                    time.  But I m family, so the 
                    Parole Officer asked if there was 
                    anybody else there -- you know, to 
                    verify it.  And I said you.

                    It just came out of my mouth.  I

                      everything seemed fine and I just
