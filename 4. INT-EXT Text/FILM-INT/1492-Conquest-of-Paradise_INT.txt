AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY
We start on a man's elegant slipper.
He is seated in a
splendid chair.
Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
hands.
His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
topaz ring.
Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
on marble floors.
CUT TO:
A Castilian face:
aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.
This is
TREASURER SANCHEZ.
A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.
We
can now here a subdued conversation.
TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:
The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.
QUEEN
ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.
He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
table.
She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
three dignitaries of Church and State.
All sit beside her.
TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
and starts to read aloud.
On screen the words:
GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500
SANCHEZ
Your Majesty would wish to know the
true facts concerning the island of
Hispanola, our first settlement in
the New World, and the activities
there of your servant, Christopher
Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
Governor of that Island.
You will
remember with what hopes and
promises he beguiled us -- the truth
is that he now presides over a state
of chaos, degradation and madness
beyond imagining.
SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.
SANCHEZ
From the beginning, Columbus proved
himself incapable of managing the
affairs of the island.
He appointed
his brothers to important positions,
at once injuring the pride and
dignity of the nobles who had gone
with him.
He promised to build a
city, the City of Isabel, named
after Your Majesty.
What he
actually built was nothing but a
collection of huts, and that in the
wrong place, for all of it was
easily swept away by rain and mud.
Is that not so, Brother Buyl?
The PRIEST nods.
BROTHER BUYL
Yes, Your Honor.
SANCHEZ
He promised gold.
Not finding the
easy quantities he promised,
Columbus commanded each Indian to
pay an annual tribute.
Most being
unable to, they were barbarously
punished, against the express wish
of Your Christian Majesties...
ISABEL lowers her eyes.
SANCHEZ
Since provocation and injustice
never ceases, many of the Indians
have fled to the forests, or have
begun to slay the Christians.
ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.
ISABEL
Could it be so?
BROTHER BUYL
Yes, Your Majesty.
SANCHEZ
But there is worse.
From the
beginning, he forced the nobles to
undergo physical labor, treating
them equally with the Indians, all
of them reduced to slavery.
When
the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
protested against such treatment...
(he pauses)
... he was executed.
(pause)
Is that not true also, Brother
Buyl?
BROTHER BUYL
Yes, Your Honor.
It is all true.
All of it.
I saw it with my own
eyes.
SANCHEZ
He has lost control.
His great
arrogance has led him into
depravity.
He encourages our
soldiers to marry the native women.
He promised a paradise, but he has
made a hell full of all its horrors.
Silence.
ISABEL
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer
Sanchez?
SANCHEZ
Yes, Your Majesty.
CUT TO:
HUT - ISLAND - DAY
CLOSE ON the FACE:
COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,
sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.
Insects
crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.
There is a dripping sound of water.
FERNANDO (V.O.)
Of all the words my Father wrote and
there were many, I remember these
the most.
"Nothing that results
from human progress is achieved with
unanimous consent..."
Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
table.
COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.
Some
of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.
A
lizard scuttles into the shadows.
FERNANDO (V.O.)
"And those who are enlightened
before the others are condemned to
purse that light in spite of
others..."
COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away
from the rain drips.
He stares out by the window, and we
see:
A devastated landscape.
Flooded roads, half-destroyed
huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.
FERNANDO (V.O.)
There was a time when the New World
didn't exist...
DISSOLVE TO:
A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY
Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the
miracle of printing, a recent German discovery.
Several
MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily
"ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately
painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
leaf.
Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,
projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.
As
MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
punctuated by light and shadow.
MARCHENA
(fumbles in a pocket
under his robe)
I have something for you.
Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.
MARCHENA
You will be heard at the University
of Salamanca...
COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.
Almost frantically he
tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.
COLUMBUS
God... That's in a week!
MARCHENA
That's what it says.
COLUMBUS
How did you manage it?
MARCHENA
(smiling)
With some difficulty.
I had to
promise them you were not a total
fool.
MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden
panel.
STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY
MARCHENA is not a tidy man.
Books are piled up on the
floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,
instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an
inquiring mind.
With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a
hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.
MARCHENA
lights a candle and considers the mess.
Then
methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.
When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his
expression.
He turns over an hourglass.
MARCHENA
Why do you wish to sail west?
COLUMBUS
To open a new route to Asia.
At the
moment there are only two ways of
reaching it...
He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the
desk.
COLUMBUS
By sea, sailing around the African
Continent -- the journey takes a
year...
His finger traces the journey, from west to east.
COLUMBUS
Or by land...
We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger
tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.
COLUMBUS (O.S.)
... But the Turks have closed this
route to all Christians.
Trading
with the Orient has become arduous,
if not dangerous.
(he pauses)
There is a third way...
We notice that the outline of the European continent is
familiar.
But we also notice that, in that great expanse
of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.
COLUMBUS
By sailing West across the Ocean
Sea.
CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.
MARCHENA
How can you be so certain?
The
Ocean is said to be infinite.
COLUMBUS
Ignorance!
I believe the Indies are
no more than 750 leagues west of the
Canary Islands.
MARCHENA
How can you be so certain?
COLUMBUS
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin
de Tyr, Esdras...
MARCHENA
(interrupting)
Esdras is a Jew.
COLUMBUS
So was Christ!
MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.
He
glances at the hourglass:
MARCHENA
Two minutes... and already you're a
dead man.
Don't let passion
overwhelm you, Colon.
COLUMBUS
(mockingly)
I'll try to remember that,
Marchena...
MARCHENA
Father Marchena!
COLUMBUS
(ignoring this)
Passion is something one cannot
control!
MARCHENA
(heatedly)
You get so carried away when you are
being contradicted!
COLUMBUS
I've been contradicted all my
life... Eternity!
MARCHENA
(amused)
Only God knows the meaning of such
words, my son.
BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT
COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,
stone-floored hallway of the modest house.
FERNANDO is
mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.
COLUMBUS takes
the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,
BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.
She is a
beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic
personality.
COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.
FERNANDO
glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say
anything.
BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is
cooking.
He explains Fernando's subdued manner.
COLUMBUS
Executions.
In the square.
BEATRIX nods.
He goes to the stone butt and pours water
on his hands.
COLUMBUS
They've agreed to see me in a week.
BEATRIX puts the candle on the table.
Her face lights up
with a smile.
He walks to her, and kisses her.
COLUMBUS
I could be gone for years.
BEATRIX
I know.
COLUMBUS
I haven't given you much of a life.
BEATRIX
(amused)
Well... that's true.
I have a child
by a man who won't marry me!
Who's
always leaving...
COLUMBUS
Are we going to argue?
BEATRIX
I'd love to argue with you
sometimes.
But you're never here!
They laugh and kiss.
COLUMBUS
Perhaps I was never meant to live
with a woman...
BEATRIX
(still kissing him)
I find that hard to believe.
DISSOLVE TO:
BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is
unusually silent and thoughtful.
COLUMBUS pours a little
wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.
FERNANDO
looks up at him, surprised.
COLUMBUS smiles, then looks
over at BEATRIX.
COLUMBUS
Fernando, don't you think we are
lucky to live with such a beautiful
woman?
He winks at FERNANDO.
BEATRIX smiles.
BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
The room is dark.
As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.
BEATRIX
looks up at him intently.
A drop of wax falls on her
skin.
She flinches, murmurs...
They make love.
AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY
An El Greco painting.
A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
dark, sculpted seats.
Candles throw a gloomy light on
their faces.
Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in
bourgeois outfits.
Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish
fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of
Aragon.
A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
claw at the top.
Languidly, he scratches his back -- his
off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
peers.
AROJAZ
You say Asia can be found by sailing
west?
COLUMBUS
Yes, your Eminence.
The voyage
should not take more than six or
seven weeks.
AROJAZ
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is
precisely where our opinions
differ...
(pause)
Are you familiar with the work of
Aristotle?
Erathostene?
Ptolemeus?
COLUMBUS
I am, Your Eminence
AROJAZ
Then you cannot ignore that
according to their calculations, the
circumference of the Earth is
approximately...
(he leans forward)
22,000 leagues or more.
Which makes
the ocean... uncrossable.
He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.
AROJAZ
But you may have found new evidence
proving that these men of knowledge
are totally mistaken!
A ripple of mirthless laughter.
COLUMBUS
Your Excellencies are aware of the
statements of Marin de Tyr?
HERNANDO DE TALAVERA
We are.
COLUMBUS
Then you are also aware that his
theories contradict Ptolemeus... De
Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
750 leagues...
A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
Commission.
But Columbus is determined to press his
theories.
COLUMBUS
The Florentine Toscanelli and the
French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both
think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
in his calculations.
And therefore,
that the ocean can be crossed.
Indignant and amused murmurs.
DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
voice to quiet the assembly.
DIEGO DE DEZA
Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de
Tyr is right...
(the laughter
subsides)
Are we here to examine this proposal
or not?
Silence.
DIEGO DE DEZA
(to Columbus)
In your opinion, how long would the
voyage be?
COLUMBUS
Seven weeks.
Six, during the summer
months.
The murmur increases.
AROJAZ
Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has
been corrected many times over the
centuries by the finest geographers.
Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a
year!
A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as
being a seaman, interrupts.
VICUNA
How would the crew survive without
being able to land for fresh water?
Water is undrinkable after six
weeks!
You'd never be able to turn
back!
COLUMBUS
We wouldn't have to turn back!
We
would find land at this point!
AROJAZ
Senor Colon, an experienced captain
such as yourself will understand our
concern with the crew.
I am not
willing to have on my conscience the
loss of men who would have relied
upon our judgment.
COLUMBUS
Excellency, you are right.
Instantly, the protests stop.
COLUMBUS
I am a seaman, not a scholar... But
as a simple man craving for
knowledge, I have read all the work
of these renowned geographers and
discovered that none of them could
agree on the exact width of this
ocean...
He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as
a lawyer before a grand jury.
COLUMBUS
Therefore, as a modest man, I
wonder:
who is right?
The experts listen.
CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by
the boldness.
COLUMBUS
Who is right?
This question remains
unanswered.
He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look
of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.
COLUMBUS
Your Eminence, there is only one way
to settle the matter.
And that is
to make the journey.
(to the assembly,
with passion)
I am ready to risk my life to prove
it possible.
AROJAZ
Your life, and that of others!
COLUMBUS
If they agree to follow me, yes.
SANCHEZ (O.S.)
Suppose you cross this ocean.
Suppose you reach Asia.
What would
Spain do there?
Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the
Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.
COLUMBUS
Trade, Your Excellency.
According
to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China
is one of the richest of the world.
Even the meanest buildings are
roofed with gold.
AROJAZ
(interrupting)
Is that all that interests you?
Gold?
COLUMBUS
No.
The Portuguese have already
discovered black-skinned people.
I,
too, will find other populations --
and bring them to the word of God.
THE MONK smiles thinly.
AROJAZ
Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
Bearer of the Cross!
MONK
(ironic)
And Colon -- the one who populates!
Another small rill of laughter.
AROJAZ
If God intended our proximity to
Asia, do you believe he would have
waited for you to show it to the
world?
COLUMBUS
Did He not choose a carpenter's son
to reveal Himself to the world?
A hum of interest.
CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.
AROJAZ
So you consider yourself the chosen
one?
A pause.
AROJAZ
Don't you realize your words could
be considered heretical?
COLUMBUS
(calmly)
Blind faith is what I consider
heresy!
The murmur turns to an audible gasp.
AROJAZ gets to his
feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a
candle only inches from his face.
There is absolute silence.
COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze
unflinchingly.
COLUMBUS
(quietly)
Asia can be found to the west -- and
I will prove it.
AROJAZ
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING
MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.
MARCHENA
... and therefore nothing could
justify the participation of Your
Highnesses in the venture that
relies upon such feeble assumptions,
and which any man of knowledge
would take to be impractical... if
not impossible.
He shakes his head, puts the letter down.
COLUMBUS looks
appalled; devastated.
COLUMBUS
They didn't listen.
They didn't
want to listen!
He paces about the book-lined room.
MARCHENA
You mustn't give way to despair.
You must wait.
COLUMBUS
Wait!
I've waited seven years
already!
How much longer do you
want me to wait?
MARCHENA
If God intends you to go, then you
will go.
COLUMBUS
(angrily)
Damn God!
MARCHENA is shocked.
MARCHENA
Colon!
COLUMBUS
Damn all of you!
You all set up
theories based on what?
You never
leave the safety of your studies!
Go out!
Find out what the world is
about and then tell me something I
can listen to!
He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.
COLUMBUS
These don't mean anything!
They're
full of assumptions!
Out of the
heads of old men who've never been
past the end of their gardens!
He hurls the book across the room.
MARCHENA is horrified.
MARCHENA
No...!
My books...!
COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping
them to the floor.
COLUMBUS
All of them!
Just lies!
MARCHENA
Colon!
Don't!
MARCHENA tries to stop him.
In his fury, COLUMBUS
accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.
His
cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.
As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this
big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.
Finally, a
short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.
CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING
COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.
He is dressed
in a homespun robe.
His arms are stretched out in
penance.
FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.
FERNANDO
Father?
DIEGO
Sssshhhh...!
One can't speak to a
man doing penance.
FERNANDO
What can you do?
DIEGO
Nothing.
That's the point,
Fernando.
A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor
beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same
way.
DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to
join them.
ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY
An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.
We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,
mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of
Granada's rooftops.
Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of
QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.
The light in her blonde hair
creates a halo around her head as she turns.
COLUMBUS
falls to his knees.
ISABEL
Rise...!
Come forward!
He approaches the window, stopping close to her.
ISABEL
scrutinizes him quickly.
ISABEL
I should not even be listening to
you, since my council said no.
But
Santangel tells me you are a man of
honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,
that you are not a fool.
COLUMBUS
(bold)
No more than the woman who said she
would take Granada from the Moors.
ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.
ISABEL
The ocean is uncrossable?
COLUMBUS
What did they say about Granada
before today?
ISABEL
(a beat)
That she was impregnable.
ISABEL smiles again.
ISABEL
I cannot ignore the verdict of my
council.
COLUMBUS
Surely you can do anything you want.
A direct challenge.
She doesn't know what to make of this
man.
ISABEL
How little you know.
This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
positions for a moment.
Now we sense COLUMBUS
scrutinizing her.
COLUMBUS
May I speak freely?
ISABEL
(with a smile)
You show no inclination to speak
otherwise!
COLUMBUS
I know what I see.
I see someone
who doesn't accept the world as it
is.
Who's not afraid.
I see a
women who thinks... "What if?"...
ISABEL
(amused at his
familiarity)
A woman?
A slight pause.
COLUMBUS
Forgive me... but you're the only
Queen I know.
She bursts out laughing.
ISABEL
Then we are equal... since you are
the only sailor I know!
A beat.
ISABEL
How old are you, Senor Colon?
COLUMBUS
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And
you?
Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away
slightly to hide it.
ISABEL
Thirty eight...
A pause.
ISABEL
You will be informed of our
decision.
COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.
As the DUENA opens the
door for him, he turns back.
COLUMBUS
Actually, I thought you were younger
than me!
And he goes out, leaving her stunned.
ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
Close up on COLUMBUS.
COLUMBUS
I WON'T!
A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy
hole in the wall.
Two beautiful eyes peer through a
grille, into the next room.
What they see:
SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together.
COLUMBUS is visibly upset.
SANCHEZ
(calmly)
We have considered your -- demands
very carefully, Senor Colon... Your
expectations are... excessive, in
every way.
COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.
COLUMBUS
If I am right, my requests are fair!
SANCHEZ holds up a document.
SANCHEZ
We have prepared our own contract...
He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it
quickly, shakes his head.
COLUMBUS
No...
SANCHEZ
No?
COLUMBUS
NO...!
I have waited too long,
fought too hard.
Now you expect me
to take all the risks while you take
the profit!
No... I will not be
your servant!
The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little
smile.
SANCHEZ
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you
are in no position to bargain with
me.
COLUMBUS
I'm not bargaining!
SANCHEZ
(steely)
Then you are too ambitious.
COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.
COLUMBUS
And were you never ambitious,
Excellency?
Or is ambition only a
virtue among the nobles, a fault for
the rest of us?
SANCHEZ
(abrupt)
If you won't accept our proposal,
we'll simply find someone who will.
COLUMBUS smiles.
COLUMBUS
If you can do that, Excellency --
I'll become a monk!
He turns, strides towards the door.
We hear a WOMAN'S
muffled laughter.
As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret
door.
SANCHEZ bows.
ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.
ISABEL
You were right, Don Sanchez... His
demands could never be granted.
SANCHEZ
Never, Your Majesty.
Although...
She turns, questioningly, towards him.
SANCHEZ
... Although one may always
renegotiate a contract.
Especially
signed by Royal Hands.
ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
BACK TO SANCHEZ
SANCHEZ
(quietly)
... Into a monk...
ISABEL
(with a smile)
Yes.
It would be a pity, wouldn't
it?
(turning to Sanchez)
Call him back!
BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with
a glass of wine.
There is a movement behind him.
BEATRIX
is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.
COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.
COLUMBUS
She said yes.
BEATRIX
(moved)
Thank God...
She smiles.
But he seems to be unable to share her
happiness.
COLUMBUS
If I ever come back, I swear I
will...
She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his
mouth.
BEATRIX
(softly)
I'm not asking you to swear to
anything.
COLUMBUS
I don't want you to wait for me.
BEATRIX
(smiling)
That's something you can't decide.
COLUMBUS kisses her.
CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark
tunnel.
FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks
slowly down the dark corridor.
Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.
COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT
CLOSE ON:
A huge illustrated map of western Europe and
Asia.
FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic
Ocean, to the edge of the map.
There, the illustrator's
imagination has created monsters:
terrifying demons;
creatures half-human, half-animal.
Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.
FERNANDO (O.S.)
You can't go there!
Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.
COLUMBUS
Why not?
FERNANDO points at the monsters.
He pulls the boy to him.
COLUMBUS
There aren't any monsters, Fernando.
The only monsters are in here...
(he taps his own
forehead)
Watch!
He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible
monsters, transforming it at once.
FERNANDO laughs
immediately.
FERNANDO
I want to go with you!
COLUMBUS
There'll be a time.
FERNANDO
You promise?
(Columbus nods his
head)
Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal
from under COLUMBUS' shirt.
FERNANDO
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints
in heaven?
COLUMBUS
(laughing)
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
And he hugs his SON tightly.
COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY
PINZON enters.
He looks furious.
PINZON
You lied!
You cheated!
We're way
past 750 leagues!
COLUMBUS
(calmly)
Six days ago, yes.
PINZON
You must be mad...!
COLUMBUS
We have to keep the hopes of these
men alive!
PINZON
We're on the verge of a mutiny,
Colon!
COLUMBUS
You think I don't know that?
PINZON
We're lost!
COLUMBUS
The land is there.
I know it!
PINZON
You don't know anything!
Listen
Colon, these are my ships, right?
So I'm telling you we're turning
back!
COLUMBUS
And then what?
Half of the water
has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!
You know that!
PINZON
(apoplectic)
Jesus Maria!
I should have never
listened to you!
COLUMBUS
You never did.
You did all the
talking for both of us, remember?
PINZON
You bloody...
COLUMBUS
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now
is go forward!
Think about that!
PINZON
You tell that to them!
COLUMBUS
You're right.
Let the men decide.
COLUMBUS moves to the door.
As an afterthought, he takes
his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.
TENT - DAWN
The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds
of the jungle all around.
COLUMBUS writes in his journal.
COLUMBUS (V.O.)
October 21st, 1492.
I think we have
returned to Eden.
Surely this is
how the world once was, before the
beginning of time.
I believe no man
will ever see this land again as we
do, for the first time...
He looks up.
UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the
hut.
He's been there all night.
COLUMBUS takes more ink
on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the
margin of his log-book.
He draws well.
He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the
drawing.
It's an electrifying moment.
UTAPAN is shocked
and amazed.
At first he is rather frightened of his own
image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS
laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a
gesture of friendship.
UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he
wishes to offer.
HUT - NIGHT
A INDIAN SHAMAN is forcing a milky fluid into PINZON'S
mouth.
COLUMBUS attempts a gesture to prevent him.
But
UTAPAN stops him.
UTAPAN
He cures.
COLUMBUS nods -- he obviously trusts UTAPAN.
CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT
In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS,
MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a
Spanish helmet on his head.
The helmet is too big, almost
covering his eyes.
The ELDERS appraise the gift with
solemn wonder.
In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of
leaves.
COLUMBUS unwraps them.
Inside:
a GOLD grimacing
mask.
The first real piece of gold.
COLUMBUS is unable
to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of
the metal.
He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks
at him.
On the ground, we see other presents offered by
the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...
UTAPAN
(to Columbus)
You come!
You speak first!
COLUMBUS
Tell the Chief we thank him.
UTAPAN
Chief knows.
COLUMBUS
Tell him his country is very
beautiful.
Tell him we are leaving
men here -- to build a fort.
UTAPAN translates.
COLUMBUS
Tell him we will return very soon.
Many of us.
UTAPAN translates.
The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple
question.
UTAPAN
Chief says -- how many?
COLUMBUS
Thousands.
UTAPAN
Why?
COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question.
For the
first time he seems to be caught short.
COLUMBUS
To bring the word of God.
UTAPAN
Chief says -- he has a God.
COLUMBUS
(pursuing)
... and also to bring medicine.
UTAPAN
Chief says...
COLUMBUS
(interrupting)
He has medicine.
(pause)
Tell him we admire his people.
UTAPAN translates.
UTAPAN
Chief says he knows you like his...
(searches for the
word)
Women...
And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and
walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving
COLUMBUS alone.
COLUMBUS
(with a little
smile)
That's a beginning...
CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAY
COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense
burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling,
trailing a think vapor of incense.
A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of
COLUMBUS' achievements and return.
The whole cathedral is
packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous
robes.
BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at
COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of
this occasion.
COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down
the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN
ISABEL and other GRANDEES.
He turns to his family,
keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his
vision.
The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in
tribal regalia...
As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon
COLUMBUS.
CUT TO:
ROOM - SEVILLE (PINZON'S DEATH) - DAY
In a simple room, a PRIEST finishes giving the Last Rites
and a sheet is pulled over the head of MARTIN PINZON.
His
WIFE and CHILDREN weep at the bedside.
CUT TO:
CATHEDRAL - DAY
A stool passes from hands to hands.
It is placed at the
Queen and King's side.
COLUMBUS sits on it -- a supreme
privilege.
To one side sit AROJAZ and SANCHEZ.
AROJAZ leans over to
whisper to him.
AROJAZ
It won't be easy to get rid of your
prophet now, Don Sanchez.
SANCHEZ
(whispering)
On the contrary, Your Eminence.
It
seems to me the man is preparing his
own cross.
ALCAZAR'S PALACE IN SEVILLE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON:
the face of a young, SPANISH NOBLEMAN, ADRIAN
DE MOXICA.
Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his
lips -- then pauses.
We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit
table.
NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN.
SANCHEZ.
COLUMBUS.
QUEEN ISABEL.
COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA.
The rest watch him
with rapt curiosity.
COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to
their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.
COLUMBUS
You must not inhale, but simply
allow the palate to enjoy the flavor
of the Tobacco...
He hands the cigar back to MOXICA.
With a casual air,
MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death.
He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of
the others.
MOXICA
(deeply embarrassed)
And you say this is an Indian vice?
By God!
I don't see any kind of
pleasure that would make this a sin.
COLUMBUS
The Indians have no such word, Don
Moxica.
ISABEL
Do they have such thoughts?
COLUMBUS
They come and go as naked as the day
God created them...
ISABEL blushes slightly.
COLUMBUS
They don't see sin in their
nakedness.
They live according to
nature, in a never ending summer.
The islands are covered with trees,
filled with blossoms and fruits.
And...
SANCHEZ
(interrupting)
Forgive me, Don Colon.
But what
about gold?
COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT
standing just behind his chair.
The SERVANT goes to open
the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman,
carrying a casket.
The WOMEN around the table fan
themselves furiously at the sight.
UTAPAN puts the casket
down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.
COLUMBUS
These are gifts for Your Majesty.
ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold
inside.
She takes out some of the little golden
ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.
She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.
ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at
COLUMBUS.
The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the
ARISTOCRATS to silence.
She speaks from behind the mask.
ISABEL
We are more than gratified.
The guests laugh obsequiously.
COLUMBUS bows a little --
looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at
him, coldly.
ROTUNDA - DAY
A SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his
sword flashing.
He is fighting an adversary we do not
see, and comments his movements.
MASTER
Si!
Si!
Muy bien!
Excellente!
(Yes!
Yes!
Good!
Excellent!)
We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS.
A
dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda,
surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade.
Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes
his protective canvas padding.
He bows at his teacher,
who salutes him in return.
COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages.
SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass
of wine.
Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a
glass.
SANCHEZ
You defend yourself admirably...
COLUMBUS
... for a commoner?
SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.
SANCHEZ
To your second expedition.
They drink.
A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of
imposing energy, approach them.
SANCHEZ
Don Colon -- Don Alonso de
Bobadilla.
A man who knows our
laws.
BOBADILLA bows.
BOBADILLA
I understand that you will soon be
appointing Governors for the
islands?
Is it not so?
COLUMBUS
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those
positions have already been taken.
BOBADILLA
(disappointed)
May I ask by whom?
COLUMBUS
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise.
BOBADILLA reddens.
BOBADILLA
I trust they are men of quality.
BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ.
COLUMBUS
But we do have a lack of notaries.
You should contact my
administration.
SANCHEZ
(amused)
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my
Dear Don Cristobal.
COLUMBUS
Good!
We are also in need of
judges.
Except there are no
thieves!
A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA.
BOBADILLA
(to Sanchez)
I see I was mistaken.
Don Colon
has no need for my services...
And he walks off.
SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of
ham.
SANCHEZ
(amused)
You seem to have a special talent
for making friends.
COLUMBUS
What...?
Do I have so many already?
SANCHEZ
(seriously)
To rise so high, in so short a time,
is a dangerous occupation.
(kindly)
A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY
COLUMBUS with two MEN:
the oldest, around thirty, is a
strong-looking man.
The youngest, no more than twenty
five, is thin and fit.
There is obvious tension in the
room.
These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS'
brothers.
BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful.
BARTOLOME
You might have given us a choice!
GIACOMO
Bartolome is stronger, more capable
than I will ever be...
COLUMBUS
I need both of you.
What are you
afraid of?
We are living what we
always dreamt of.
GIACOMO
You know I never shared those dreams
with you.
COLUMBUS
Are you saying you refuse to help?
COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise...
BARTOLOME
(amused)
You bastard... you always had your
own way...
COLUMBUS
Let me show you something.
He opens the door to a terrace.
CUT TO:
DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
In an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is
having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO,
served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA.
GIACOMO eats with
gusto.
GIACOMO
(as Nima pours the
wine)
Nima's a good cook!
BARTOLOME
She's more than that!
Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA
smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh.
To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic
of the food.
GIACOMO
What is it?
COLUMBUS
Eat!
I'll tell you later.
As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses.
GIACOMO
I'd like to know what I'm eating.
COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.
COLUMBUS
Iguana.
A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches
slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine.
The BROTHERS laugh again.
COLUMBUS
What wrong with it?
The Indians eat
it!
GIACOMO
I'm not an Indian.
BARTOLOME
He wishes he were back in the
seminary.
Priests always eat well.
(tasting his wine,
grimacing)
And they have very good cellars.
GIACOMO
Nothing grows here!
Everything rots
in the ground.
The wheat and vines
wither before we can harvest them.
COLUMBUS
We've got to learn to live like the
Indians.
(pause)
Eat your Iguana!
Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner.
INFIRMARY - CITY OF ISABEL - NIGHT
An INDIAN is playing the flute.
In the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most
primitive conditions, DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick.
On a
segregated part of the room are the INDIANS, several
coughing.
They are attended by a doctor, DOCTOR CHANCA, BROTHER
BUYL, and other NOVICES.
A NOVICE attends to an INDIAN, gently lifting his head,
helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do.
BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered
in open sores.
The NOVICE joins him.
BROTHER BUYL
What kind of disease is this?
DOCTOR CHANCA
I don't know.
It seems almost as if
we have exchanged diseases with the
Indians.
They die of our most
common cold, and we of their plague.
BROTHER BUYL
God forgive us!
CUT TO:
GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING
A tribunal.
Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and
flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.
MOXICA stands
before them.
COLUMBUS
In one act of brutality, you have
created chaos.
Tribes who were
fighting each other are now joining
forces against us!
All that because
of your criminal savagery!
MOXICA
(casually)
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
COLUMBUS
You'll be held in detention,
deprived of your privileges and
possessions.
Until you are returned
to Spain where you will be judged.
Have you anything to say?
MOXICA
(with exquisite
insolence)
You will regret this.
He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room.
BARRACKS - NIGHT
A THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the
wall.
CUT TO:
BARRACKS - NIGHT
FOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted,
burst into the room.
Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes
facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be
his friends.
SOLDIER
(without stopping)
You animals!
Can't you wait!
Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her,
the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the
SOLDIER.
He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts
to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his
trousers.
THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the
ground.
THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror.
TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.
A THIRD ONE kneels and
starts stuffing it with gold dust.
THE SOLDIER chokes and
suffocates.
THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall,
terrified.
AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings,
slowly.
She starts sobbing and imploring in her language.
THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in
the lower part of her belly.
COLUMBUS' STUDY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
MOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall.
On the table, the model of the future city.
Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the
parchment he has rolled up.
He blows the flames from the
torch onto the model.
Fire races up and down the streets
of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel.
A mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes...
GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING
The wind grows stronger.
Doors bang inside the
building... a melancholy sound.
COLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS.
They are
silent.
After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak
quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself.
COLUMBUS
Perhaps hope only exists in the
journey.
When it begins, everything
is still possible -- every
expectation; every dream...
The BROTHERS do not answer.
COLUMBUS
This is not how I imagined it to be.
CUT TO:
GOVERNOR'S PALACE - BEDROOM - DAY
COLUMBUS is stretched out on his bed, in his devastated
bedroom.
A column of ants is threading its way across the
floor, each ant carrying a piece of leaf.
Rain falls over
a table covered with documents.
COLUMBUS' face is covered in dried mud.
SANCHEZ (V.O.)
He promised us gold but has failed
to find it.
He subjects the natives
to violence, provocation and
injustice.
He sent them to Spain
against the express wishes of Your
Majesty...
AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY
We are back to the first scene.
In the vast, opulent,
glittering room, ISABEL listens impassively to the voice
of SANCHEZ.
Also present, other GRANDEES, representatives
of the church and state.
SANCHEZ
... But there is worse.
He ordered
the execution of five members of the
nobility...
ISABEL
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
BROTHER BUYL
Yes, Your Majesty.
It is all true.
I saw it with my own eyes.
A pause.
ISABEL seems to struggle inwardly with her
emotions.
SANCHEZ waits, expressionless, but on the point
of victory.
ISABEL
Then, what do you suggest, Don
Sanchez?
SANCHEZ
He must be replaced.
ISABEL
And who would you think of, for such
a task?
CUT TO:
GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY
One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps
forward.
We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man
COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda.
COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with
GIACOMO.
Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them.
BOBADILLA
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
COLUMBUS
Yes... I remember...
BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who
comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing
the royal seal.
BOBADILLA
My letters of appointment.
COLUMBUS
Appointment to what?
BOBADILLA
Viceroy of the West Indies.
COLUMBUS
Congratulations.
Then I am free to
search for the mainland.
BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low
blow.
BOBADILLA
Didn't you learn?
The mainland was
discovered.
Weeks ago.
By another
Italian.
I forgot his name.
A MAN IN BLACK
Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.
COLUMBUS pales.
Then...
COLUMBUS
How far from here?
BOBADILLA
I am not a seaman.
But I heard it
is no more than a week at sea.
I
hope you are not too disappointed.
COLUMBUS
How could I be?
The mainland has
been found.
Exactly as I said it
would.
BOBADILLA
I am afraid this is not the worst
news.
CUT TO:
CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY
All is dark.
We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he
lies on the hard bed.
He is sweating heavily; his beard
is filthy and matted, like his hair.
He looks feverish.
A key turns in the lock.
The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN.
COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare
at them.
His eyes are reddened with infection at the
corners.
The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light.
FERNANDO
(quietly)
Father?
Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up.
COLUMBUS
Fernando...!
My God...!
He laughs, overcome with joy.
Embraces DIEGO.
COLUMBUS
A man!
Diego, how did this happen?
DIEGO
Santangel is going to see the Queen.
We are going to get you out of here.
COLUMBUS
Good!
I have to go back!
DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at
COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his
eyes rimmed with dried mucus.
DIEGO
Go back?
There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice.
He walks
over to the table.
The candlelight illuminates maps,
charts, drawings, figures...
COLUMBUS
I have to explore the mainland.
FERNANDO
This time with me!
COLUMBUS laughs and DIEGO looks at them both in
astonishment.
DIEGO
In your present state it is madness,
Father!
FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.
FERNANDO
Nobody is forcing you to come with
us.
DIEGO is hurt.
DIEGO
I can't go anyway.
A pause.
FERNANDO
She's very beautiful!
The Queen has
very good taste.
Diego is getting
married.
DIEGO seems saddened by his brother's attitude.
Once
again DIEGO feels like the outsider.
COLUMBUS hugs him.
COLUMBUS
I am happy for you, Diego.
ALHAMBRA - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY
Like Lucifer and Gabriel, SANTANGEL and SANCHEZ sit on
either side of ISABEL.
SANTANGEL
Granted his faults.
Yes, a hundred
times!
But the man is still
remarkable.
ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY
UNDECIDED.
SANTANGEL presses his point.
SANTANGEL
All he asks is a chance to explore
this... mainland.
SANCHEZ
It does not belong to him.
SANTANGEL
(quietly)
In a way, it does, Don Sanchez.
(to the Queen)
I beg Your Majesty to receive him.
To hear him... He will make no more
demands.
He has changed.
He is
penitent.
SANCHEZ
Penitent...?
He is suing us for
breach of contract!
ISABEL
Is he?
She starts to laugh.
ISABEL
Really?
SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing.
AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY
COLUMBUS is shown into the room.
ISABEL is waiting for
him.
He drops to his knees before her.
This time she walks
towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other
signs of physical deterioration.
Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console
him.
Her hand is dying to comfort.
But instead, she
offers her hand for him to kiss.
ISABEL
Rise... Please...
COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes, as they
meet hers, are as clear as before.
ISABEL smiles with
relief to see it.
He looks back at her.
COLUMBUS
Now I do look older than you.
She smiles -- then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps
her dignity.
ISABEL
We have decided to allow you to
undertake another voyage to the new
world...
COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a
gesture.
ISABEL
But without your brothers.
Nor are
you to return to Santo Domingo or
any of the other colonies.
You may
explore the continent.
COLUMBUS
Thank you.
ISABEL
There is one thing I'd like to
understand... Why do you want to go
back, after all this?
COLUMBUS
Your Majesty -- some men are content
to read about things.
I must see
them with my own eyes.
I cannot be
other than I am.
She almost bursts out laughing -- only pauses, turns
slightly, then goes out.
ALHAMBRA PALACE - ROOM NEXT TO THRONE ROOM - DAY
SANCHEZ is standing alone in the next room; he has
obviously been listening.
He looks at her.
ISABEL
I know, I should not tolerate his
impertinence.
SANCHEZ
Then why?
ISABEL
Because he is not afraid of me.
ALHAMBRA PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY
SANCHEZ, in another direction, along a corridor, towards
his office.
As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a
hand seizes him.
COLUMBUS.
SANCHEZ
All I have to do is call the guards.
COLUMBUS
Call them.
SANCHEZ looks at him -- and doesn't call.
COLUMBUS lets
go of him.
SANCHEZ
I am not afraid of you.
You are
nothing but a dreamer.
COLUMBUS
Look out of that window.
Surprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out.
COLUMBUS
What do you see?
SANCHEZ
Roofs... towers, palaces...
spires...
COLUMBUS
All of them created by people like
me.
SANCHEZ turns round again to face him.
COLUMBUS
No matter how long you live,
Sanchez, there's something that will
never change between us.
I did it!
You didn't!
COLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the
echoing corridor.
MANOR HOUSE - DAY
COLUMBUS walks slowly through the great rooms.
There is
nothing left:
no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing.
He turns, sees BEATRIX standing in a doorway, looking back
at him.
They are both moved.
COLUMBUS
God... you're so beautiful!
I can't
believe no other man has ever taken
you away from me...
BEATRIX
They tried... but I didn't let them.
She smiles.
They don't dare to touch.
BEATRIX looks
round the empty room.
BEATRIX
They took everything...
COLUMBUS
(looking at her)
Not everything... Do you think I
care?
I'm a free man again.
Riches
don't make a man rich, they only
make him busier...
They laugh.
There's a pause.
COLUMBUS
God, how much I've missed you!
And they throw themselves into each other's arms.
CUT TO:
DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - EVENING
All that has been left is a simple table and one chair.
They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty
room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on
the figs and hams and wine... and on their faces, as
BEATRIX sits on his lap.
SANTANGEL (O.S.)
One chair.
One table.
What more
can a man expect, when he tries to
sue the Crown?
They laugh.
With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX
gets off COLUMBUS' knee.
SANTANGEL comes forward, and
COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend.
BEATRIX goes to
the kitchen.
COLUMBUS
I owe you everything, Santangel...
but as you see, I can't repay you.
SANTANGEL
On the contrary.
It is I who owe
you everything.
Through you, I have
been an adventurer, an explorer!
It's true I shall never see the new
world... but it's here...
(he points to his
head)
And here...
(pointing to his
heart)
COLUMBUS smiles.
BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass
for SANTANGEL.
SANTANGEL
What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a
discoverer, a man of imagination...
not a politician.
You weren't meant
to govern -- You cannot be all
things to all men.
He takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass.
SANTANGEL
I wish you could have compromised.
It would have made your life
easier...
COLUMBUS
But as least we haven't been bored,
have we?
They all laugh, and drink.
SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT
COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.
He shivers
violently.
FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes
his eyes.
Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.
TRANSLATOR
I help.
A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER.
The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of
leaves from a pouch.
He chews the leaves himself for a
moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens
COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging
COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands.
COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.
SHIP'S CABIN - DAY
COLUMBUS is lying on his couch.
FERNANDO is bathing his
eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in
them.
COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.
CUT TO:
FERNANDO is writing under his FATHER'S dictation.
COLUMBUS
I came to Your Highness with honest
purpose and sincere zeal.
I did not
undertake these voyages for honor or
wealth -- that is certain.
After
years of service to the Crown, I do
not have a roof to put over my
head... Your Majesty allowed me to
explore the continent, believed to
be Asia.
I now believe that it is
an new Land, of unknown proportions
and wealth... Life has more
imagination than we carry in our
dreams...
DISSOLVE TO:
ALCAZAR PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
The DUENA, sitting beside ISABEL, quietly continues to
read COLUMBUS' letter aloud.
DUENA
"I should be judged as a Seaman who
by Divine Will discovered a New
World, and thereby placed it under
the sovereignty of Your Majesties.
I humbly beseech Your Majesties that
if it pleases God to remove me
hence, you will help the name of
Columbus to be remembered with
honor... Weep for me, whoever has
charity, truth and justice."
She stops reading.
ISABEL turns her face away.
UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY
An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher
belonging to AROJAZ -- indicates a line across a large
globe:
the route between Europe and America.
AROJAZ (O.S.)
The sunset route to the new
continent is now well-established...
We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending
a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography.
AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly.
Facing him,
enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS,
including SANCHEZ.
We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces.
AROJAZ
... West by south west for 750
leagues to Santo Domingo.
From
there, west north west, leaving San
Juan to the north, reaching the
island of Hispanola on the northern
cape of San Raphael... Then onto the
mainland, at the Cape called Gracias
a Dios...
We continue to rise up the tiers of seats...
AROJAZ
Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace --
has confirmed for all humanity the
existence of an unknown continent...
Tierra Incognita...
On a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS, listening impassively.
AROJAZ
... This continent was first
discovered by a sailor commissioned
by your Majesty...
CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes.
AROJAZ
His name... Amerigo Vespucci...
On COLUMBUS.
