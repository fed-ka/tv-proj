                                          TEASER

      INT. HANK S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      HANK DOLWORTH, 40s, lies awake.  Not by choice.  Lights out, 
      head on his pillow, staring at his ceiling.

                                  HANK
                    Now.

    He turns to a bedside clock.  4:23.  A beat.  Another.  4:24.  
    He refaceshis ceiling and restarts his countdown:

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                      Fifty-nine, fifty-eight, fifty --

      LATER, he channel-surfs an old Magnavoxvia remote.  At this 
      hour, it s infomercial after infomercial for Rascals, bladder 
      control medications, etc..  Hank s in bed alone, a bachelor 
    as evidenced by the upkeep of his room: clothes not put away, 
      a ragged comforter, newspapers on the floor.  At first 
      mention of The Clapper, he turns off the TV.

      LATER, he s lying perfectly still now, pillow over his eyes.  
      Dead silence.  Then: any suspicion he s actually dozed off is 
      destroyed when he delivers a thunderous raspberry.

      INT. HANK S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    He ties a robe over his t-shirtand boxers as he pads into 
    his LIVING ROOM.  He stops at a pile of mail accruing below 
    his mail slot and sifts through it with his toe.  Bill, bill, 
      overdue notice, second notice.  He bends over to pick that 
    one up and strains his back.  Fuckit, he ll get it later.

    He wanders into HIS KITCHEN and takes down a drinking glass.  
      Opens his fridge and removes a carton of milk.  It feels 
      light so he shakes it and peers inside.  Empty.

                                  HANK
                    Super.

      EXT. WORKING-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - HOURS LATER

    IN A MIRROR: a small home, its driveway empty. 

      Hank sits slouched in the passenger seat of a  79 Ford 
      Courier, heels dug into the dash, chewing a toothpick from 
      breakfast, still feeling the ache in his back.  His eyes 
      shift from the vacant driveway in his sideviewmirror to a 
      high-end bed-and-bath catalogue in his lap.                                                                                    2.



      Beside him, behind the wheel, sits his partner BRITT POLLACK. 
      Britt s younger than Hank and the athlete of the two; like 
      Hank, he s dressed for manual labor: jeans, a flannel over a 
      t-shirt, work boots (currently off).  He s absolutely 
      motionless, head back, baseball cap tipped over closed eyes, 
      very probably asleep.  

    The two are parked in shade, twenty yards from the house Hank 
    is monitoring.  Hand-painted on the side of their Courier are 
    the words  Gomez Bros. Pool Cleaners.  

                                  HANK
                    Loan me a thousand dollars.

      A beat.  Britt does not open his eyes.

                                  BRITT
                    Yeah, alright.

                                  HANK
                    Thinking about buying new towels.

                                  BRITT
                    You want to be a dryer person?

                                  HANK
                    I think maybe.

      Hank checks the driveway again: still empty.  Up ahead he  
      sees a young family loading its belongings into a U-Haul, a 
       FOR SALE BY BANK  sign staked in their lawn.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    I tell you what happened to me last 
                    night?  
                            (noresponse)
                    Did I?

                                  BRITT
                          (he can t escape this)
                    Tell me.

                                  HANK
                    I couldn t sleep.  I don t know 
                    why, I didn t have a nightmare, I 
                    just couldn t.  So I go down to the 
                    kitchen to get some milk.  And I 
                    take the carton out of the fridge 
                    but it s empty.                                                                                    3.



                                  BRITT
                          (waits for more, then:)
                    For a very short story, that went 
                    on a bit.

                                  HANK
                    Senility.  Not only did I put the 
                    milk back when it was empty, I 
                    don t even remember finishing it.  
                    Hey, scoff now but it ll happen to 
                    you one day.  You ll be driving 
                    home one night, not thinking about 
                    a thing, and suddenly you ll pull 
                    up to the house you lived in 
                    fifteen years ago.

                                  BRITT
                    I ll drive all the way to Laughlin?

      Hank moves to knock the cap off his partner s head but back 
      pain prevents him.  He notices, in his sideviewmirror, a 
      WHITE ACURA pull into the driveway.

                                  HANK
                    He s here.

    And Britt snaps to, opening his eyes and tipping his cap up 
    and adjusting his rearview mirror so he can see.  A BODY-
      BUILDER TYPE emerges from the Acura, gathers grocery bags 
      from within, then whistles out an ENGLISH BULLDOG who 
      obediently follows him indoors.

                                  BRITT
                    Christ, who drives a white car 
                    anymore?  Besides mailmen.

                                  HANK
                    He s a big guy.  Remind me: how 
                    much we getting paid for this?

                                  BRITT
                    Tell you after.

      That doesn t bode well.  Still, the moment Body-Builder 
      disappears inside, Hank and Britt are out of the truck and 
      getting ready, Hank grabbing a pool skimmer and bucket of 
      chlorine from the truck s cargo hold, Britt unburdening 
      himself of his flannel, tugging on his boots.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Once I m back there, gimme thirty 
                    seconds  fore you knock.                                                                                    4.



                                  HANK
                          (nods, then  struck )
                    Hey, you know what tune popped into 
                    my head this morning --

                                  BRITT
                          (who knows what s coming)
                    -- oh please don t --

                                  HANK
                    -- for the life of me, I can t 
                    remember the title of the thing --

                                  BRITT
                          (hurrying his boot on)
                    -- I m asking nicely, I m hungover
                    and I m asking nicely --

                                  HANK
                    -- bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- stop --

                                  HANK
                    -- bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- quit it --

                                  HANK
                          ( Close To You )
                    -- bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-
                    bum-bum, bum-bum-bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- goddammit, it s gonnabe in my 
                    head all day now!

      Hank, proud of himself, snatches the cap off his partner s 
      head before Britt darts away into a neighboring yard.

      INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      Body-Builder unloads groceries, muscle powders mostly, as the 
      bulldog waits for a treat that won t come.  DING-DONG!

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    Winston, stay.

    AT HIS FRONT DOOR, Hank s on the front stoop, baseball-
      capped, skimmer and chlorine in his hands.  He s picking wax 
    out of his ear as Body-Builder answers the door.                                                                                    5.



                                  BODY-BUILDER (CONT D)
                    Yeah?

                                  HANK
                    Hey, cumtaclean your pool.  S okay
                    I go  round back?

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    I m sorry?

                                  HANK
                    I m the pool cleaner.  You re Mr. 
                    Ehrengard?Am I saying that okay?

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    No.  I mean: my name s not 
                    Ehrengard.

                                  HANK
                    This is411 Sierra Mar?

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    Yeah.

                                  HANK
                    You don t have a pool needs 
                    cleaning?

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    Don t have a pool.

                                  HANK
                          (just stares at him)
                    You sure?

      MEANWHILE, IN THE BACK YARD, Britt hops over a perimeter 
      fence, landing soundlessly.  He keeps low, in stealth-combat 
      mode, as he scours the yard, then creeps toward a rear door.

      BACK AT THE FRONT, Hank verifies the address on a work order.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Says here 411 Sierra Mar.  Can I 
                    ask a favor?  My cell just crapped
                    out on me, you mind if I borrow 
                    your phone, call HQ and find out 
                    where the hell I m supposed to be?  
                    It s a local call, promise.

      Body-Builder glances at the truck out front: Gomez Bros. Pool 
      Cleaners.  Big but not bright, he shrugs what the hell.                                                                                    6.



    IN HIS KITCHEN, Winston slurps at a water bowl as, outside, 
      Britt tries a door handle, locked.  He ducks down when Body-
      Builder enters the kitchen to fetch his cordless.  Once he s 
      gone, Britt resumes his b&e, reaching through a doggie door 
    and extending his arm up to unlock the knob.

    AT THE FRONT DOOR, Hank eyes the unkempt interior: looks like 
    his place.  Body-Builder returns with the phone; Hank dials.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Thanks.  Nice house, by the way.

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    It s a messy right now.  Just split 
                    with the wife, it was her job to 
                    clean the place.  You married?

                                  HANK
                    Not that I know of.

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    Smart man.  My ex, first she moves 
                    out, then all she does is bitch I 
                    won t let her take any furniture.  
                    I tell her,  You want it, you ll 
                    have to steal it. 

                                  HANK
                          (his call answered)
                    Hey, Martha, I m here over at 411 
                    Sierra Mar and I got a little 
                    problem...

    IN THE KITCHEN, Britt searches for Winston, who s wandered 
      into the living room.  Britt tries to coax him back. 

                                  BRITT
                    Pssst. C mere, boy.

      Britt scours the shelves.  Nabs an energy bar/pockets it. 
      Finds dog treats.  Waves one in the air for Winston s benefit 
    but the dog s wary.  He has no choice but totip-toe into the 
      living room to get him.  Hank (still on the phone with some 
      confused fellow he dialed at random) clocks him enter.

                                  HANK
                    ...sorry?  411 Sierra Madre?  Well, 
                    that makes a difference.  Okay, 
                    Martha, you re a peach.

      Britt scoops up Winston and tiptoes back the way he came, 
      flashing a mischievous smile at Hank, Body-Builder none the 
      wiser.  Hank hangs up and returns the phone.                                                                                    7.



                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Thanks again.

      EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

      Returning to the Courier, Hank spies that young family again, 
    all loaded into their U-Haulnow; the mother fights back 
      tears as the father insists it s all going to be okay.  Hank 
      cringes as he gets in his truck and keys the engine.  

    He passes the Body-Builder s and stops at the next house.  
      Britt emerges from its yard, cradling Winston.  Before he can 
    get in the truck though, Hank clamps down on the door s lock.

                                  HANK
                    OK, tell me now: how much did we 
                    make for that?

                                  BRITT
                    S mydry cleaner s dog.  She said 
                    anything we bring in, half-off.
                          (Hank groans)
                    C mon, what else were we gonnado 
                    today?  Cure cancer?

                                  HANK
                    Maybe.

      Just then Body-Builder hits the sidewalk behind them, looking 
    for his dog.  He spots Winston in Britt s arms and shouts:

                                  BODY-BUILDER
                    HEY!  THAT S MYDOG!

    No time to dawdle, Britt drops Winston through the window 
      into his seat, then leaps himself into the cargo hold.  Hank 
      stomps the gas as Body-Builder gives chase, hopelessly.  
      Britt salutes him with his own energy bar, then ducks his 
      head through the cab s rear window and smiles.

                                  HANK
                    Your dry cleaner s dog.  What do 
                    you own that could possibly need 
                      dry-cleaning?
                          (butBritt s grin is 
                            infectious; soon Hank 
                          can t help but smile)
                    You donkey.

                                        ACT ONE

      EXT. PIE  N  BURGER - DAY

      Hank and Britt s favegreasy-spoon.  The Courier s parked out 
      front, window cracked open for Winston, pawing at the glass.

      INT. PIE  N  BURGER - DAY

      Hank and Britt, regulars here, are greeted as such.  Britt s 
    on his cell as Hank finds seats at the counter.

                                  HANK
                          (to another REGULAR)
                    Hiya, Hughie.

                                  REGULAR
                    Hank.  Ever hear the one about 
                    Sammy Davis, Jr. s favorite song?

                                  HANK
                          (he has, from him)
                     Please Don t Talk About Me One 
                    Eye s Gone. 
                            (hisWAITRESS approaches)
                    Dottie, that a new apron?

                                  DOTTIE
                    Save it.  Two with everything?  
                    Your partner want fries?

                                  HANK
                    Hey, Short Straw: you want fries?

      Britt, john-bound, shoots him a thumbs-up/middle-finger.

                                  DOTTIE
                    That s a confusing gesture.

                                  HANK
                    He s a confused man.  Hughie, I 
                    tell ya what happened to me last 
                    night?

                                  HUGHIE
                    You just sat down.

      Britt enters the men s, still on his call; he stops a PATRON 
    at the next urinal from flushing.

                                  BRITT
                    -- no, that s fine, we ll keep him 
                    here at the office until then.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    9.

                                  BRITT (CONT'D)
                          (hangsup; to the Patron)
                    Thanks for waiting.

    He proceeds into a stall to puke his guts out.

      BACK WITH HANK at the counter, Hughie a captive audience --

                                  HANK
                    -- not only was the milk empty, I 
                    couldn t remember finishing it in 
                    the first place.  Senility.
                          (Hugh cups an ear: huh?)
                    Senility.  A sign you re getting 
                    old.  Like...

    As Hank indicates  loss of hearing,  he notices someone 
      sitting farther down the counter getting up.  He follows her 
      form as she begins to pass.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Hey, lookahere.

      GRETCHEN DOLWORTH, Hank s ex, stops.  A few years younger 
      than Hank but in much better repair.  Smart, stylish, Hank 
      blew it when he let her slip away (and he knows it).

                                  GRETCHEN
                          (a smile)
                    Hey.

                                  HANK
                    What reyou doing here?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Working my lat sand tri s, whatya
                    think I m doing here.

                                  HANK
                    Good to see you.  Say hi to Hughie.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Hi, Hughie.

                                  HUGHIE
                    Hello, Hank s ex.

                                  HANK
                    Can you sit a second?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Can t.  Things.  Though I do need 
                    to talk to you.                                                                                    10.



                                  HANK
                    I mailed this month s alimony.  
                    Sorry, I had to --

                                  GRETCHEN
                    -- postdate the check three weeks?  
                    I got it, don t sweat it.  Things 
                    are going that well, huh?

                                  HANK
                          (eyes on Winston outside)
                    We just closed a major case.

      Gretchen smiles, always aware when Hank s full of shit. 
      Then, out with her news:

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I m putting 298 up for sale.

                                  HANK
                    What?  You love that house...

                                  GRETCHEN
                    I also love to eat.  And the way 
                    the book market s going, I gotta 
                    choose between the two.  

                                  HANK
                    If you re having trouble with the 
                    mortgage, I can...
                          (they both know: he can t)
                    You sure?  You put so much work --

                                  GRETCHEN
                    We both did.  Yeah, I m sure, 
                    thanks.  It s time anyway I made a 
                    change.  The first open house is 
                    today.  I thought you should know.

      Hank s not only shocked, he s devastated by this: the last 
      monument to their marriage is to be auctioned off.  But he 
      does his best to disguise it, throwing up his hands: if 
      that s what you want, that s the way it is.  

                                  GRETCHEN (CONT D)
                    Thanks for understanding.  I better 
                    run.  Talk to you soon?

    She kisses him on the cheek and exits.  He watches her go, 
      still in love.  Britt returns.                                                                                    11.



                                  BRITT
                    Was that Gretchen?  What s she 
                    doing here?

                                  HANK
                    Her lat sand her tri s.
                          (to change the subject)
                    How s our client?

                                  BRITT
                    Stuck at work.  Office policy, she 
                    can t have pets there.

                                  HANK
                          (plucking dog hair from 
                          his sleeve)
                    Why, I wonder.
                          (then, as their food 
                            arrives, he makes a 
                            decision)
                    Say, Dottie, could you add on an 
                    order to go?  Grilled tuna on 
                    wheat, onion rings and a coke.

                                  BRITT
                    We going to go see Mags?
                          (Hank nods/checks if he 
                          can cover this)
                    Dots, one more burger, too.  
                      Protein-style, no onions.

                                  HANK
                            (cash-strapped)
                    Who the hell for?

      INT. ELEVATOR - OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

    ON WINSTON, chomping down his burger, fed to him by Britt.  
      Hank stretches his back as he watches the floors climb.

                                  HANK
                    You have to do that here?

                                  BRITT 
                    You d rather I do it in the truck?
                            (pointtaken)
                    Gretchen was looking good today.  
                    You two should give it another go?
                          (there s nothing Hank 
                          would like more; he 
                            dismisses it with a wave)
                    C mon, you should ask her out.  
                    Tell her that milk story.                                                                                    12.



      INT. OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

      They exit the elevator, Britt carrying Winston, Hank the to-
    go bag.  They approach a door:  MARGARET TYLER, ATTORNEY.   
      Before they enter, though, Hank stops Britt.

                                  BRITT
                    What?

                                  HANK
                      Shh-shh-shh-shh.

    He signals: listen.  Britt tilts his head to hear what s 
      going on inside when:

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                          ( Close To You  again)
                    Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum...

                                  BRITT
                    Motherlover.

      INT. MAGGIE S LEGAL OFFICE - DAY

    The to-go bag lands before MAGGIE TYLER, early 30s; she rips 
      into and devours its contents like a lion with an early 
      Christian.  Hank and Britt sit, awed by her ravenousness.

                                  HANK
                    Remember the Jaws ride at 
                    Universal?  

                                  BRITT
                     Keep your hands and arms inside 
                    the tram at all times. 

                                  MAGGIE

                      Upyoursyoumothers.

      Maggie moans, sated, and leans back in her desk chair; she is 
      eight months pregnant and looks about to pop.

                                  MAGGIE (CONT D)
                    Whose pooch?

                                  BRITT
                      A client s.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Jesus, you guys aren t taking lost 
                    dog cases now, are you?  It s not 
                    gotten thatbad?                                                                                     13.



                                  BRITT
                    More of a search and rescue.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Well, make sure it doesn t pisson 
                    the carpet, huh, it s seiseland 
                    it s new.  Now: what prompts the 
                    pleasure of your company?

                                  HANK
                    Other than to witness this Olympic 
                    display of gluttony?  Why do you 
                    think, Mags?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Cause you need a job maybe?  Well, 
                    I got nothing.  At least, nothing 
                    right for you.

                                  HANK
                      C mon.We re housebroken.  We ve 
                    got our shots.  Britt just learned 
                    which fork to use with a salad 
                    course.  Throw us a bone.

    She takes them in, unable to deny:

                                  MAGGIE
                    There is onething.  But I was 
                    gonnarefer it to Baranskeyand 
                    Katz.

                                  BRITT
                          (scoffs)
                    Please.  Ask Baranskeyand Katz to 
                    find their dicksthey d start 
                    checking each other s asses.

      That stops the conversation cold for a sec.  Hank revives it:

                                  HANK
                    Who s the client?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Mr. L.B.Lindus of San Marino.  A 
                    missing personscase, think of the 
                    novelty.  It s full-freight, if you 
                    can remember what that means.

      Hank and Britt sneak a glance: full-fucking-freight!

                                  HANK
                    Sounds good.                                                                                    14.

                    Of course it sounds good.  It s 
                    actual work.

    She studies them, not sure whether to let them have it.

                                  HANK
                    C mon, Mags.  Who brought you the 
                    sandwich?
                          (then, re: Britt)
                    You gonnadeny this smile?

      Britt, prompted by Hank, smiles.  Maggie relents.

                                  MAGGIE
                    OK.  But only because I m a 
                      sentimental slob.
                          (shejots an address)
                    Head over right away.  Leave the 
                    dog in the truck and wear a tie.

                                  HANK
                    May your first child be a masculine 
                    child.

    She hands over the address and they start out.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Oh, there s one other thing.

                                  BRITT
                          (stopping)
                    Uh-oh.  She s got that  means 
                    business  look.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Got a call yesterday.  Apparently 
                    the LAPD put you on their Christmas 
                    list.  Naughty side, not the nice.

                                  HANK
                    Why?!
                          (she looks at him: you-
                            know-why)
                    We followed the book on that!  We 
                    didn t do anything illegal --
                          (Britt has to laugh)
                    -- that anyone could possibly 
                    prove!                                                                                    15.



                                  MAGGIE
                    I don t have to tell you it was 
                    your old pal Gustafson who flagged 
                    you.  Whatever bad blood is between 
                    you, well, it s bad.  So watch 
                      yourselves.  Because, as well we 
                    know, when the LAPD gets a hard-on 
                    they tend to stick it somewhere.

      This weighs on Hank.  They go.

                                  BRITT
                    Thanks, Mags.  We ll both walk a 
                    little straighter with that in 
                    mind.  Call if your water breaks.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Mr. Dee, Mr. Dum.  Go with God.

      EXT. MAGGIE S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

      Hank, Britt and Winston pass out-of-business storefronts on 
      their way back to their truck.  

                                  BRITT
                    You gonnatell me why Gustafson s 
                    pissedat you?

                                  HANK
                    It s ancient history.

                                  BRITT
                    Yeah, and he s getting over it all 
                    over the place.  Where to?
                          (Hank passes the address)
                     435 HuttingerDrive, San Marino.

                    When did you get so jaundiced?

                                  BRITT
                    When did you start using the word 
                     jaundiced ?

      EXT. CALIFORNIA SPANISH MANSION - DAY

    AN HISPANIC HOUSEKEEPER stands within a massive front door.  
      Britt shoots Hank a look: toldja.                                                                                    16.



                                    HOUSEKEEPER
                    Mr. Lindus is expecting you.

      INT. CALIFORNIA SPANISH MANSION  

      Hank and Britt are led through the house.  Hank s buttoned 
    his shirt and wears a tie now; Britt s still in his t.

                                  BRITT
                    What is it about here reminds me of 
                    your place?

                    Tuck in your shirt at least, huh?

                                  BRITT
                    Not wearing a belt.

      EXT. CALIFORNIA SPANISH MANSION - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

    The Housekeeper shows them out to a TENNIS COURT where 
      BINGHAM LINDUS, an athletic 50, rallies against his 16-year
    old SON.  Britt was correct only up to a point; Lindus seems 
      about as un-stuffed-shirtas a man playing on his home tennis 
      court can be.  As our guys watch the point:

                                  BRITT
                    You ever play this game?

                                  HANK
                    Not professionally.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Nice, Phillip.  Nice.
                            (spyingthem)
                    Hi: are you guys...? 

                                  HANK
                    Margaret Tyler sent us over.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                          (he approaches, hand out)
                    Bingham Lindus.  Call me Bing.

                                  HANK
                    Mr. Lindus, I m Hank Dolworth, my 
                    partner Britt Pollack.  Britt s not 
                    wearing a belt today.                                                                                    17.



                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I asked Esther to set out some tea.
                          (hegestures them to a 
                            gazebo; back to his son)
                    Phil, I have to talk to these men 
                    for a while.  You wanna work on 
                    your serve  til I get back?
                          (tothem)
                    We think he may make the junior-pro 
                    tour next summer. 

      Neither Hank nor Britt knows what that means.

    IN THE GAZEBO - MOMENTS LATER

      Lindus pours iced tea for the three of them.

                                  HANK
                    Lovely home.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Thanks.  It s been in my wife s 
                    family three generations.  This 
                    area used to be all orange groves.  
                    Lemon?

                                  HANK
                    Thank you.  Will she be joining us, 
                    your -- ?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    No, Gwen passed away six years ago.  
                    Leukemia.  Consequently all this 
                    belongs to my kids now, or a trust 
                    representing them.  Philip out on 
                    the court and my daughter Elenore. 
                    It s she I want to talk to you 
                    about today.  This is all 
                      confidential, right, this 
                      conversation?

                                  HANK
                    Entirely.  We re like doctors.  Our 
                    profession relies on discretion.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Otherwise you lose your licenses?

                                  BRITT
                    If we had them.  

      That stops Lindus short.  Hank, smiling, explains:                                                                                    18.



                                  HANK
                    We ve found from experience that 
                    abiding by state certification 
                    guidelines unduly limits our 
                    efficacy.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Meaning?

                        HANKBRITT
      Meaning we --Meaning we break the law 
                                                    sometimes when we feel it 
                                                  suits our purpose.
                                                      (a look to Hank)
                                                  Tends to speed things up.

                                  HANK
                    That said, rest assured, nothing 
                    you tell us leaves this gazebo.

      Bingham considers them both.  Then:

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I need you to find my daughter. 

                                  HANK
                    Elenore.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    None of us have seen her in two 
                    weeks.  Not me, not Philip, not 
                    Esther.  

                                  HANK
                    She s been missing two weeks?  Have 
                    you contacted the police?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    She s not, sorry, she s not 
                     missing.   Ellie is, well... She s 
                    a freshman at USC, though still 
                    living here at home.  This semester 
                    she fell in with a crowd at school, 
                    music types, I don t know what they 
                    call themselves.  These charges 
                    started showing up on her credit 
                    card bill, from guitar stores and 
                    liquor stores.  I became suspicious 
                    Ellie was being exploited by these 
                    people.  So I sat her down and told 
                    her as much.  She stormed out.                                                                                    19.



                                  HANK
                    That was the last you saw her.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    We ve tried calling her cell phone, 
                    going down to campus.  Nothing.  
                    Her dean says she hasn t been in 
                    any of her classes.

                                  BRITT
                    You don t think she s in any 
                     trouble ?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Not the kind you mean.

                                  BRITT
                    You seem pretty sure?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I m not a hundred percent but... 
                    How do I put this?  I suspect my 
                    daughter s not that kind of girl.

    Off Hank and Britt, not sure what that means --

      INT. BINGHAM LINDUS S DEN - MOMENTS LATER

    ON A PHOTOGRAPH OF ELENORE, 19, brunette, cozily arm-in-arm 
      with another GIRL, a blonde.  They re at an  emo  party, a 
      cross between gothand punk.  Hank and Britt study the pic as 
      Lindus jots down Elenore s cell, license plate, car model.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    We found this hidden in her room.  
                    That s Elenore on the left.  I 
                    can t say I was shocked.  Ellie 
                    never showed much interest in boys 
                    in high school.

                                  HANK
                    Pretty girl.  We should probably 
                    take a look around her room 
                    ourselves.  Might be something, an 
                    address book --

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Is that necessary?  I mean, I feel 
                    strange enough siccing a pair of 
                    private eyes on my daughter.  
                    Having you toss her room...                                                                                    20.



                                  HANK
                    We d be very careful.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                          (he holds firm: no)
                    Besides, we ve been through it, 
                    Philip, Esther and I.  All we found 
                    was that picture and a parking 
                    ticket.

                                  HANK
                    Of course.  This is enough to get 
                    started on anyway.
                            (hescratches his scalp, a 
                          signal to Britt)
                    We should get going.

      Britt nods: signal understood.

      INT. LINDUS S HOME - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

      Lindus walks them out.

                                  HANK
                    Any idea who this other girl in the 
                    picture is, by the way?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I suspect that s Laura.  Ellie 
                    mentioned her a few times.  Last 
                    name Prince or Price, I can t 
                    remember.

      Britt fidget-grunts.  Hank and Lindus try to ignore him.

                                  HANK
                    You never met her?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    No.  She dropped Ellie off here 
                    once but didn t come inside.
                          (offanother fidget-grunt)
                    You alright?

                                  BRITT
                    Curry for lunch.  Always goes 
                    straight through me.

      Hank blanches.  Lindus points the way to the john.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Down the hall, past the stairwell, 
                    first door on the left.                                                                                    21.



                                  BRITT
                    Thanks.

      Hank shoots Britt a look: you have to do that here, now? 
      Britt shoots one back: yeah, I do, and goes.

                                  HANK
                    You don t happen to have that 
                    parking ticket still, do you?

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Paid it. 

      Hank snaps his fingers: too bad.

      INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Britt smiles at the housekeeper on his way to the bathroom.  
      Soon as she s passed from sight, he darts upstairs. 

      INT. ELENORE S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Britt enters.  He canvasses a hope chest, then wanders into 
      Elenore s closet.

      INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

      Lindus hands an envelope to Hank.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I had this check cut as a retainer.  
                    Maggie Tyler didn t tell me who to 
                    make it out to.

                                  HANK
                    I should mention, Mr. Lindus --

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    -- please: Bing--

                                  HANK
                    -- because Elenore is not a minor, 
                    all we can do is find her for you.  
                    We can t force her to come home.

      Hank at last sees the figure on the retainer: holy shit.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I thought you said you were willing 
                    to bend the law when necessary?                                                                                    22.



                                  HANK
                    Bending the law is one thing, 
                    kidnapping is --

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    I m sorry, I was kidding.  

      Lindus smiles and Hank joins him, unconvinced.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS (CONT D)
                    All I want is to talk to my 
                    daughter.  Make sure she s okay.  
                    The sooner I can do that, the 
                    happier we ll all be.
                          (asBritt returns)
                    Feeling better?

                                  BRITT
                    Much.  Nice towels in there.  You 
                    should take a look.

      Hank, demurring, offers his hand to Lindus.

                                  HANK
                    Mr. Lindus.  We ll be in touch.

      EXT. LINDUS HOME - CONTINUOUS

      Hank and Britt exit, Lindus watching them from his door. 

                                  HANK
                    What dyou find?

                                  BRITT
                    Diary under her mattress.

                                  HANK
                    Let s go find this girl.  

                                  BRITT
                    And cash that check.

      EXT. PASADENA STREET - DAY

      SOME KIDS playing kickball in the street skedaddle for the 
      sidewalks as the Gomez Bros.Ford Courier rattles through.

      INT. FORD COURIER - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

      Britt plays percussion on the steering wheel and sings as 
      Hank leafs through Elenore s diary.  Both he and Hank feel 
      good, filled with the bonhomie which comes from employment; 
      even Winston s in a chipper mood.                                                                                    23.



                                  BRITT
                     You ve got a thing about you.
                    I just can t live without you.
                    I really want you Elenore near me. 

                                  HANK
                    Full-freight for a runaway rundown.  
                    Son. Of. A. Bitch.

                                  BRITT
                     Your looks intoxicate me.
                    Even though your folks hate me.
                    There s no one like you Elenore 
                    really. A-bow-bow-bow-bow. 

                                  BOTH OF THEM
                     Elenore gee I think you re swell 
                    and you really do me well, you re 
                    my pride and joy --

                      -- etcetera.   Take a left here.

                                  BRITT 
                       Etcetera?   Really?

                                  HANK
                    Would I lie to you?  About that?  
                    Take a left.

                                  BRITT
                    What are you gonnado with the 
                    money?  Pay bills probably.  I know 
                    what I m gonnado.  

                                  HANK
                    Get a new polo pony?

                                  BRITT
                    Buy a really awesome hammock.
                          (Hank laughs)
                    What?

                                  HANK
                      I wouldabet the farm you were 
                    gonnasay  trampoline.   Take a 
                    right here.

                                  BRITT
                    Where we going?

                                  HANK
                    Places.  Take a right.                                                                                    24.



      Britt turns and before he knows it --

      EXT. PASADENA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

    -- they ve pulled up in front of a modest craftsman home.  An 
       Open House Today  sign is spiked in its lawn.

                                  BRITT
                    This is your old place.

                                  HANK
                    Yep.

                                  BRITT
                    Gretchen s putting it up for sale?

                                  HANK
                    That s what the sign says.

                                  BRITT
                    Signs can lie.

      INT. GRETCHEN S (AND FORMERLY HANK S) HOME - CONTINUOUS

      A handful of PROSPECTIVE BUYERS roam the place as Hank and 
      Britt enter.  It s been a few years since Hank s lived here 
    and he stops to take it in.

                                  BRITT
                    Wow.  She did a lot of work in 
                    here.  These floors are new.
                          (then, bored)
                    Shouldn t we start looking for this 
                    girl?

      Hank nods/holds up a one-secfinger as a REALTOR approaches.

                                  REALTOR
                    Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Any 
                    questions about the property?

                                  HANK
                          (takes out their retainer)
                    Yeah, I have one.  If I give you 
                    this check as a deposit right now, 
                    how quickly can you get all these 
                    yokels out of here?

    Off Britt s reaction: hey, wait a minute--

                    DMV, how can I help you?

      INT. FORD COURIER - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

                                  HANK
                    Hi, I need to speak to a 
                      supervisor, please.
                          (he sput on hold)
                    Stop pouting.

    At the wheel, Britt looks glum.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    I mean it.  Makes you look effete.

                                  BRITT
                    I m not pouting.  I m fuming.

                                  HANK
                    Which is worse, I d think.

                                  BRITT
                    What are you doing buying a house?  
                    You could barely afford lunch an 
                    hour ago, how are you going to pay 
                    a mortgage?!  That check was half
                    mine.

                                  HANK
                    As is the deposit on the house now.

                    What, I m supposed to live with you 
                    too now?  Katie would love that.

                                  HANK
                    I bet she would.

                      Supervisor.  How can I help you?

    As Britt continues to fume, Hank drops his voice:

                                  HANK
                    This is Detective Mark Gustafson,

                    Our computers are down here, 
                    wondering if you could run a plate 
                    for me?

                                  DMV EMPLOYEE
                    I ll need an ID voucher.

      Hank flips his visor to reveal a post-it with a list of LAPD 
      detective names and numbers.  He finds  Gustafson. 

                                  BRITT
                    Are you sure you wanna --

                          (the number checks out)
                    OK, Detective Gustafson, what s the 
                    plate number?

    As Hank reads off Elenore s plate --

      EXT. HARBOR FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

    -- the Courier pushes on toward --

      EXT. AN INDUSTRIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

    -- a deserted stretch south of downtown s skyscrapers. 
      Littered with vacant lots and decaying brick factories.

                                  BRITT
                        ...1300...1300...When was the

                            (spottingit)
                    1300.  Looks promising.

      1300 is an abandoned factory.  Might as well have tumbleweeds 
      blowing past.  Hank notes an adjoining, fenced parking lot.                                                                                    27.

                    Let s take a gander.
                          (Britt doesn t budge)
                    You coming?

                                  BRITT
                    As a rule, I don t get outtathe 
                    truck without a retainer.

      Hank tosses him the diary.

                                  HANK
                    Read up then.  Anything about a 
                    Laura Prince or Price, crease the 
                    page.  Winston, c mon.

                                  BRITT
                    Whatyaneed him for?

                                  HANK
                    I like to work with a partner.

      MOMENTS LATER, at the parking lot s fence, Hank squeezes 
      Winston through an opening.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                          (waving him onward)
                    Go on, Winnie.Act natural.

      Winston begins sniffing around the lot and Hank proceeds to 
    the factory s entrance.  He knocks, waits.  Notes a spray-
      painted logo on the cement beneath him:  Dirty Sanchez. 

                                  A VOICE WITHIN
                    Yeah?!

                                  HANK
                    Hi!  My dog s stuck in your lot!

                                  VOICE WITHIN
                    What?

                                  HANK
                    My dog s stuck in your lot!!

      A moment passes before the door opens.  A twentysomething
      HIPSTER stands there, none-too-happy to be disturbed.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  My dog snuck through your 
                    fence.                                                                                    28.



                                  HIPSTER
                    Yeah?

                                  HANK
                    Yeah.  Mind if I get him?

    The Hipster eyes Hank, then glances around the block: all he 
      sees is a beat-up pool cleaners truck, nobody inside.

                                  HIPSTER
                    Alright.

                                  HANK
                    You re a prince of the realm.

      Britt, sunk down in his seat, watches as Hank enters. 

      INT. ABANDONED FACTORY/HIPSTER DOMICILE - CONTINUOUS

    The place s barren but for a threadbare couch here and a half-
      rotted mattress there: clearly it s a crash pad for more than 
      just one person.  The Hipster leads Hank through.

                                  HIPSTER
                    What reyou doing walking your dog 
                    in this neighborhood anyway?

                                  HANK
                    Just driving through, Winston had 
                    to go.  Tell the truth, so did I. 
                    Dummy me figured I didn t need to 
                    leash him.  
                          (helooks around)
                    Sweet pad.  What s the rent on a 
                    place like this?

                                  HIPSTER
                    Why, you think I m squatting?

                                  HANK
                          (hands up: whoa)
                    I m just here to get my dog.
                          (hespies a makeshift 
                            RECORDING STUDIO)
                    Hey, you re a musician!

                                  HIPSTER
                    What couldagiven you that idea?

                                  HANK
                    I played bass in college.  You done 
                    anything I might veheard?                                                                                    29.



                                  HIPSTER
                    Man, if you dheard my stuff, then 
                    my stuff would be bullshit.

      Hank s CELL RINGS. 

                                  HANK
                    Excuse me.
                          (heanswers)
                    Hey, honey.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. GRETCHEN S BOOK SHOP - DAY

    The anti Barnes & Noble: small, quaint, well-appointed.  
      Gretchen s the owner/sole employee.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    My realtor just phoned to say you 
                    strolled in half an hour ago and 
                    took my house off the market.  My
                    house.  What the hell are you 
                    doing?

                                  HANK
                          (keeps his tone familial, 
                          for Hipster s sake)
                    I sensed a certain reluctance on 
                    your part this morning about 
                    selling so I took action.

    As Hank chats, his eyes canvass the space.  A sticker on a 
      guitar case matches the logo outside:  Dirty Sanchez.   The 
      Hipster, meanwhile, heads to a door to the parking lot. 

                                  GRETCHEN
                    You know how hard it is to sell a 
                    home in this market?!  You know how 
                    much harder it ll be when it falls 
                    out of escrow because your check 
                    bounced?

                                  HANK
                    It won t bounce.

                                  HIPSTER
                          (let s go)
                    Dude.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Not to mention how inappropriate, 
                    how wildly invasive--                                                                                    30.



                                  HANK
                    Honey, we ll talk about this later.
                          (hehangs up)
                    My wife.  She s a pistol.

      EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

      Hank gathers Winston as the Hipster unlocks the fence.

                                  HANK
                    Thanks again.  Say, what s your 
                    name, or your band s name?  I ve 
                    got some friends in the industry, 
                    maybe they could help you out.

                                  HIPSTER
                    I told you, man, that s not what 
                    I m about.

                                  HANK
                    I never met anyone who didn t need 
                    a little help getting their stuff 
                    out there.

                                  HIPSTER
                          (extends his hand)
                    You just did.  

                                  HANK
                          (takes it, doesn t let go)
                    Hey, you don t happen to know a 
                    girl named ElenoreLindus, do you?

                                  HIPSTER
                    Man, you got your dog --

                                  HANK
                    How about a Laura Prince or Price?

      That name hits a nerve.  Hipster tears his hand away.

                                  HIPSTER
                    Get off my property, huh?

    He means it.  Hank steps onto the sidewalk and the Hipster 
      slams his fence shut behind him.

                                  HANK
                    Thanks for the help.

    The Hipster throws him the bird as he returns inside.  Hank 
      returns to the truck.  Britt rises in his seat.                                                                                    31.



                                  BRITT
                    Kid s a turd. 

                                  HANK
                    Let s see where he floats.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MINUTES LATER.  The Hipster emerges from his place, pushing 
    out a Vespa.He steps on, kick-starts it and is off.  He 
      doesn t notice the Ford Courier falling in a distance behind.  

    In the truck: Britt keeps a loose tail.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                          (re: the diary)
                    You glean anything from this?

                                  BRITT
                    She mentions Laura once or twice.

      Hank notices: Britt has creased every page.  They continue to 
      follow the Vespa, into --

      EXT. A BOHEMIAN COMMERCIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

    -- where the Hipster pulls up at a COFFEEHOUSE.  He dashes 
      inside as Britt and Hank u-turnto park across the street.  
    As they case the joint: 

                                  HANK
                    Whatyathink?  You wanna stay in 
                    the truck for this or --

                                  BRITT
                          (back on the job)
                    Crack a window for Winston.

      They re going in.  Hank takes Elenore s diary with him.  As 
      they disembark, though, an LAPD PATROL CAR cruises by.  The 
    two UNISinside clock them as they pass.  

                                  UNI 1
                    Is that -- ?

                                  UNI 2
                    Yep.

    As Britt smiles at them and mutters under his breath --

                                  BRITT
                    Hello, donkeys.                                                                                    32.



    -- Hank notices something tucked in the diary s back pages: A 
      PAYCHECK STUB.  The payee:  Laura Price.   The payer:  JA
      KUEHN& ASSOC. PAYROLL CO.   He pockets it.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    What s that?

                                  HANK
                    Pay stub for Laura Price.

    He pockets it.  Cops passed, they proceed to --

      INT. COFFEEHOUSE - DAY

    -- and it s obvious the moment they step inside how wildly 
    out of place they are.  Because this joint is emos-only.A 
      dozen or more oddballs stare at them hostilely, hair-dyed and 
      bobbed, ears, eyes and noses pierced.  

      Hank and Britt scan the place: no sign of the Hipster or 
      anyone resembling Elenore.  Hank approaches a BARISTA.

                                  BARISTA
                    Can I help you?

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, you serve coffee here?
                          (shedoesn t get it)
                    City Health Inspectors.  Doing a 
                    surprise sweep on local food 
                    service establishments in the area.

    He opens Elenore s diary, as if it s his inspection notebook.

                                  BARISTA
                    My manager s not here right now.

                                  HANK
                    S okay, we don t need him.

    Two places Hipster could ve gone: hallway to the johns or the 
      kitchen.  Britt takes the former, Hank the latter.

                                  BRITT
                    I m gonnamake sure the  lavoslos 
                    manos are posted --

                                  BARISTA
                    -- wait, I can t let you --                                                                                    33.



                                  HANK
                    -- miss, you wanna keep that  B 
                    over your coffee grinder you ll let 
                    us take a look-see --
                          (to COOKS in the kitchen)
                    -- perdon, hermanos.

    He spies an OFFICE DOOR and heads straight to it --

                                  BARISTA
                    -- you can t go in there --

    -- to find inside, a CABAL OF EMO TOUGHS, Hipster included, 
      huddled around a desk, discussing something very secret and 
      likely illegal.  Because everyone shuts up fast.

                                  HANK
                    Sorry to interrupt, fellas.What 
                    is this, a band meeting? 

      MEANWHILE, Britt checks out the back hallway: a supply 
      closet, a unisex bathroom (in use) and an alarmed emergency 
      exit.  FLUSH!  The bathroom door opens and --

    -- a BLONDE GIRL emerges.  Britt smiles as she passes, then 
      stops cold.  He follows her back into the coffeehouse.

      BACK IN THE OFFICE, the emo-toughs are on their feet, 
      surrounding Hank, as the Hipster whispers to the CABAL 
      LEADER, informing him of Hank s appearance at his factory.

                                  EMO TOUGH
                    What the hell you want, old man?!

                                  HANK
                    Searching for someone.  Maybe you d 
                    look at a picture.

    As Hank flashes the photo of Elenore, he notes a set of 
      building blueprints pinned to a wall.  Beside it, a slogan: 
     GO ORGANIC! CHEMICALS KILL! 

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    What is that, a bank?

                                  EMO TOUGH
                    You a cop?

                                  HANK
                    Me?  No...
                          (he scoffs)
                    Used to be.                                                                                    34.



      Hank s not getting any more popular in here.  The Cabal 
      Leader gives instructions to Hipster who darts out.

    OUT FRONT, Britt maneuvers to get a clean look at the Blonde 
    and at last he succeeds: it s Elenore, hair dyed.

                                  HIPSTER
                    Laura.
                          (sheturns)
                    We gotta go.

    She exits with him.  Britt debates following them, opts to 
    get Hank instead.  In the kitchen he finds him under assault, 
      getting roughed up as emo-toughs push him out of the office.

                                  HANK
                    Fellas, what the hell, I m not 
                    trying to steal your eyeliner --

      Britt makes a quick example of one emo by popping him square 
    in the nose.  As the boy goes down, Britt pulls Hank out.

                                  BRITT
                    She s here.

                                  HANK
                    Who?  Elenore or Laura?

                                  BRITT
                    I m not sure.

      EXT. COFFEEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Britt and Hank exit in time to spot Blonde Elenore climbing 
      aboard the Hipster s Vespa.

                                  BRITT
                    C mon.

      Hank and Britt hurry back to their Courier, to give chase, 
      only to find: it s being lifted onto a TOW TRUCK.  The two 
      uni soversee the tow job.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    What the hell?!

                                  UNI 2
                    One hour parking zone.

                                  HANK
                    We were here five minutes!                                                                                    35.



                                  UNI 1
                    Not according to our watch.

    The Unisstifle smirks, obviously enjoying this.

                                  HANK
                    You gotta be -- Oh, you 
                      sonsabitches!

                                  UNI 2
                    You can reclaim your vehicle at the 
                    city impound.  I m sure it ll only 
                    take five, six hours to process at 
                    the most.  Have a great day.

    The cops go, laughing.  So does the Courier, behind the tow 
      truck.  So does, in the opposite direction, Elenore Lindus.

                                  HANK
                    Shit.We had her.

                                  BRITT
                    Hank.  Winston was in the truck.

      Hank squeezes his eyes shut: fuuuuuuuck--

      INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

    WE HEAR HopetonLewis s rocksteadyclassic  Boom ShakaLaka. 

      KATIE NICHOLS, 20s, winsome, a heartbreaker at first, second, 
    and forty-fifth glance, lip-syncs the lyrics as she dumps 
      bargain-brand pasta into a pot of boiling water.  

    IN QUICK CUTS, she alternates between prepping dinner-on-a-
      budget (cheap bottle of red, microwaved meatballs, salad 
      tossed via zip-locbag) and studying for a vet school exam.  
      A KNOCK AT HER FRONT DOOR draws her away to --

      EXT. HER TINY HOME - GLENDALE - NIGHT

    -- where she discovers Britt on her doorstep.

                                  KATIE
                    Yes?

                                  BRITT
                    Sorry to disturb you, ma am, during 
                    the dinner hour.

                                  KATIE
                    That s alright, what is it?                                                                                    36.



                                  BRITT
                    I m canvassing the neighborhood on 
                    behalf of a charity called Tomes 
                    for Tots.  We collect used books 
                    from everyday folks like yourself 
                    and donate them to local private 
                    schools so that white, privileged 
                    children won t miss any opportunity 
                    or advant--

                                  KATIE
                    You lose your keys?

                                  BRITT
                    And Hank s truck.

    At the sound of her pasta boiling over, she kisses Britt and 
      rushes back inside, shouting over her shoulder:

                                  KATIE
                    Tell your BFFI made enough for 
                    three.

      Britt turns to Hank, paying off a CABBIE in the street.

                                  BRITT
                    Soup s on.

                                  HANK
                    Christ, please don t let her ve
                    made Italian again.

      INT. KATIE S HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER

      Hank picks at his penne, hiding his disappointment, as Katie 
      reads Elenore s diary.  Britt swills a Budweiser.

                                  KATIE
                    Wow.  This is weird.  Elenore 
                    barely ever mentions herself in 
                    here.  It s all Laura, Laura, 
                    Laura.

                                  HANK
                    Maybe she s in love.

                                  KATIE
                    Uh-uh.  This isn t love.  Maybe 
                      schizophrenia but not love.  
                    Elenore is either batshitobsessed 
                    with this girl or batshitthinking 
                    she isthis girl or...                                                                                    37.



                                  HANK
                    Or?

      Katie s stumped.

                                  BRITT
                    Or she s dyeing her hair and 
                    calling herself Laura cause it s 
                    the new black.  Does it matter?  If 
                    she loves this girl or thinks she s 
                    her or thinks she s Foghorn 
                    Leghorn.  We just have to find her 
                    and tell Daddy.

                                  HANK
                    Sure.  But it might helpto know. 
                    Thanks, Katie.  For your insight.

                                  KATIE
                    Ask a vet student for a psych run-
                    up.  I like your guys  style.  Now 
                    if you two don t mind, I have a mid-
                    term in the morning.

      Hank notices: there is a subtle but palpable tension between 
      Katie and Britt tonight.  He tries to break it.

                                  HANK
                    On what?

                                  KATIE
                    Equine dentistry.

                                  HANK
                    No shit.

                                  KATIE
                    Did you know that mares are twice 
                    as likely to suffer from gum 
                    disease as stallions?

                                  HANK
                    That s female horses, mares?

                                  KATIE
                    Hence  the old grey mare, sheain t 
                    what she used to be. 

                                  BRITT
                    Did you know that bears, since the 
                    very beginning of their existence, 
                    shitin the woods?                                                                                    38.



      Katie exits, unamused.Britt studies the paystubHank found 
    in Elenore s diary earlier.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    What s the plan?  Find where Laura 
                    works, hope Elenore isn t far off?
                          (off Hank s glare)
                    What?

                                  HANK
                    You re some terrific boyfriend, you 
                    know that?  

                                  BRITT
                    I didn t say anything!

                                  HANK
                    Exactly.  That girl loves you, you
                    treat her like a chair.

                                  BRITT
                    You think I should buy a house I 
                    can t afford, prove my love to her?

      That punch lands.  Hank clears his plate, snags Britt s Bud 
    as he goes.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Hey, I wasn t done with --

                                  HANK
                    Yes you were.

      INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      Katie does dishes.  Hank joins her at the sink, plucking up a 
      dish rag to help dry.  She tries to stop him but he insists.

                                  HANK
                    You cooked dinner.  Least I could 
                    do is pretend to clean up.

                                  KATIE
                    Sorry it was pasta again.   Write 
                    what you know, cook what you can t 
                    burn.                                                                                     39.



                                  HANK
                    I ever tell you: back during my cop 
                    days, whenever we answered a 
                    domestic abuse call, we d take the 
                    woman aside and offer to kick the 
                    shitouttaher dude for fifty 
                    bucks.  You interested?

                                  KATIE
                    Fifty?

                                  HANK
                    I ll give you a friend rate: forty.
                          (then, off her sadness)
                    There something going on you wanna 
                    talk about?

    She shakes her head but soon can t help confess:

                                  KATIE
                    I wanna have a baby.

      Hank waits for more, then:

                                  HANK
                    Right this very moment?

                                  KATIE
                    Sooner than later.

                                  HANK
                    You tell Laughing Boy this?

                                  KATIE
                    Last night.  He said he wasn t 
                    ready to  pull the goalie.   Then 
                    went out and got hammered.  He 
                    didn t say anything to you?

                                  HANK
                    But I smelled it on him all day.

                                  KATIE
                    You know, it s been a lot of fun 
                    living in Neverneverlandwith you 
                    two.  But I m gonnahave to become 
                    a real person soon.

                                  BRITT
                          (from the next room)
                    Hank!  Pooch is waiting!

      Hank ignores him.                                                                                    40.



                                  HANK
                    Just be patient with him.  I m sure 
                    by the time he s ninety he ll pull 
                    his head out of his ass.

                                  KATIE
                    With you as a role model?
                          (thatstings a little)
                    Sorry.

                                  HANK
                    Don t be.
                          (a kiss to her temple)
                    I think you ll be a spectacular 
                    mother.

      Hank exits.  

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    OK, Messy Marvin: mount up.

      Britt appears in the doorway, facing Katie.

                                  BRITT
                    You want anything from out in the 
                    world?

    She shakes her head, pretending nothing s wrong.  He goes, 
      pretending to believe her.

      EXT. KATIE S GARAGE - NIGHT

      Britt throws the cover off a 1961 Triumph Trophy Bird.

                                  HANK
                    God, I hate this thing.

                                  BRITT
                    Why?  Cause it s  unsafe? 

                                  HANK
                    Cause it s so butch.

      EXT. CITY IMPOUND LOT - NIGHT

    The men arrive via motorcycle.  Hank heads inside to pay the 
      impound fee while Britt goes in search of Winston; the moment 
    he spots the pup lapping at a waterbowl, he lights up.

                                  BRITT
                    Winston!  Where dyou go, we ve 
                    been worried sick?!                                                                                    41.



    The feeling s mutual; Winston comes hurtling toward him, into 
    his arms.  Hank watches from an office window.  The opening 
      strings of Nat Cole s  Stardust  take us to --

      EXT. DRY-CLEANERS (CLOSING UP) - NIGHT

    -- where BRITT S DRY-CLEANER re-unites with Winston.

                                    DRY-CLEANER
                    Ooooh, my little baby!  Oh, I ve 
                    missed you!

      Britt can t hide the fact he ll miss the animal.  

                                  BRITT
                    He s been a...a very good boy.

      Hank waits in the reclaimed Courier, Trophy Bird in its 
      cargo.  He flips Laura Price s paystubbetween his fingers, 
      lost in thought as he listens to the radio:

       ...love is now the stardust of yesterday, the music of the 
      years gone by... 

      Britt gets in and Hank snaps out of his reverie.

                                  HANK
                    All set?

      Britt nods.  Both men in too contemplative a mood to joke.

      INT. FORD COURIER - MOVING - NIGHT

      They drive in silence. 

                                  HANK
                    You know what you d do we didn t do 
                    this for a living?

                                  BRITT
                    Play for the Dodgers.  I d say 
                    Angels but I ve never seen myself 
                    as an American Leaguer.  Why?

                                  HANK
                          (reticent at first, then:)
                    I ve been thinking lately...about 
                    pulling the ripcord on this thing.

                                  BRITT
                    Say that again non-euphemistically.                                                                                    42.



                                  HANK
                    Every morning I wake up I feel it 
                    in my knees.  I m past it.
                          (thisamuses Britt)
                    I m serious.  Today in the 
                      coffeehouse those mascara thugs 
                    scared the shitouttame.  Besides 
                    how s this look, my running around 
                      dognappingand chasing down lesbian 
                    debutantes at my age?  Left here.

      Britt pulls the truck into an OFFICE BUILDING s parking lot.

                                  BRITT
                    You areshittingme, right?

                                  HANK
                    Hand to God.  I m thinking about 
                    retiring.

      INT. CORPORATE OFFICES - NIGHT

      A logo reads:  JAKUEHN& ASSOC. PAYROLL CO.   Hank and Britt 
      traverse the dark, empty office floor with flashlights.

                                  BRITT
                    In this economy?  To do what?

      Hank hasn t thought that far ahead.

                                  HANK
                    You realize you d have the most to 
                    gain if I did.  You d be sole 
                    partner.

                                  BRITT
                    Of what?  And there s no such thing 
                    as sole partner, there s just sole.
                          (then, struck)
                    This isn t about Katie, is it?

                                  HANK
                          (it is, sort of)
                    What, no, of course not.

                                  BRITT
                    I know she worries about money.

                                  HANK
                    I m sure she s got a lot of 
                    concerns about you, pal, but 
                    whether you re Fortune 500 material 
                    or not isn t one of  em.                                                                                    43.



    At file cabinets they thumb through employee records.

                                  BRITT
                    So why?

                                  HANK
                    I told you --

                                  BRITT
                    Why really?  Don t give me that 
                    Danny Glover I m-too-old-for-this-
                      shitshit.Your knees ache, your 
                    back s sore.  OK, I weep for you. 

    At the office s elevator bay, a SECURITY GUARD steps onto the 
      floor, doing his nightly rounds.  He hears the murmur of our 
      guys  voices and tracks them. 

                                  HANK
                    It doesn t feel like a grown man s 
                    job anymore.  I come home, I don t 
                    feel I ve earned it.  And that s 
                    okay for a while, when you re 
                    young.  But my while s up.

    For the first time Britt suspects Hank might be sincere about 
      this and it terrifies him.  He comes to a file  Price, Laura  
    and hands it off.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Laura Price.  Employee since March 
                    at the Gilbert Chicken Farm.  Huh.  
                    I ve known a lottathings a pretty 
                    girl lldo for a buck but never 
                    cutting heads off chickens --

    And that s when Hank gets hit in the eyes by a beam of light.  
    He and Britt turn, squinting, to discover the Security Guard, 
      flashlight leveled at them.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Sorry.  You guys almost done here?

      Hank holds up the file: indeed they are.  He reaches into his 
      pocket for cash for Oscar.

                                  HANK
                    How s the wife, by the way?  Due 
                    any day now, right?                                                                                    44.



                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    I didn t tell you?  It s twins.

      Hank reaches back into his pocket for more cash.

      EXT. CORPORATE PARK - NIGHT

      Hank and Britt return to the truck.

                                  BRITT
                    So when were you thinking about 
                    doing this, getting out?

                                  HANK
                    Hey, it s just something I m 
                    kicking around.  Don t bum-rush me 
                    out the door yet.
                            (sensingBritt s unease)
                    Something you wanna say?

                                  BRITT
                      Nah.Besides your suggesting that 
                    what we do for a living is 
                    infantile, you haven t given any 
                    offence.
                          (before Hank can speak)
                    I think you should quit, it s what 
                    you re experienced at.  Being a 
                    cop, Gretchen...

      Britt just crossed a line.  And he knows it.

                                  HANK
                    Fair enough.  Let s get you home to 
                    get shit-facedso your girlfriend 
                    can figure out maybe it s time to 
                    move on.
                          (now the other line s 
                            crossed; both men fume)
                    I m pretty zonked.  Whatyasay we 
                    call it a night?

                                  BRITT
                    That s a genius goddamnidea.

      INT. GCFPLANT MANAGER S OFFICE - DAY

      CLEMMONS, a clip-on/comboverplant manager, studies the 
      Elenore-Laura picture.  His office is adorned with western 
      memorabilia -- cowboy art, horse paperweights, etc..

                                  CLEMMONS
                    Which one am I supposed to be 
                    looking at?

                      BRITTHANK
      Either.Both.

      Still some residual anger between them from the night before.  
      Hank and Britt stand across from him, by a window overlooking 
      a giant processing room below.  Off Clemmons  look --

                                  HANK
                          (Texas in his voice)
                    One of  em s the girl we re looking 
                    for, one is her friend.  Either 
                    look familiar to you?

                                  CLEMMONS
                          (he looks again)
                    Nope.  But I do have over three 
                    hundred employees here.

                                  HANK
                    Would you mind checking your 
                    records?  Your payroll company J.A.
                    Kuehnand Associates says Laura 
                    Price has been on the job here 
                    since March.

                                  CLEMMONS
                    They told you that?

      Hank nods.  Clemmons knows that s bullshit.And Hank knows 
    he knows.  He appeals to him as a pal.

                                  HANK
                    Listen all we need is a home 
                    address or phone number.  My buddy 
                    here, he s Ms. Price s brother,

                          (not going for it)

      INT. ANTEROOM - DAY

      Hank and Britt exit past a SECRETARY.  Under their breath:

                                  BRITT
                    Think he s calling the cops on us?

                                  HANK
                    I would be.

      Hank stops, spotting something.  Britt follows his gaze to a 
      portrait on the wall: the Gilbert Board of Directors, front 
    and center Lawrence Bingham Lindus III.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                          (to the Secretary)
                     Scuseme, ma am, that s not L.B.
                    Lindus in that picture, is it?

                                  SECRETARY
                    Yes, that s Mr. Lindus.

                                  HANK
                    Dang-it-all, I haven t seen Bingin 
                    ages.  Wha she doin on the board?

                    His family founded the company.  
                    Rather his wife s family.  When 
                    Gwen Gilbert passed on, Mr. Lindus 
                    took over as chairman.

    Our boys share a look: interesting.  As they go:

                          (mocking Hank s accent)
                    Y alltake care y all.

      INT. GCFPROCESSING ROOM - DAY

      They pass through the hangar-sized room of WORKERS in aprons, 
      surgical masks, hair nets and latex gloves prepping 
      decapitated chickens.  As they take in the defeathering, 
      gutting and quartering of chickens:                                                                                    47.



                                  BRITT
                    Hey, while we re here, maybe you 
                    should fill out a job application?  
                    Since you re looking for something 
                      respectable to do.

      Hank just squints at him.

      EXT. GIBSON CHICKEN FARMS - CONTINUOUS

      They exit into sunlight.  Britt notices a YOUNG MAN entering 
    the compound, a lunch box in hand, his most distinct feature 
      a bandaged nose.  He alerts Hank.

                                  HANK
                    Isn t that the kid whose face you 
                    picked a fight with yesterday?

      Unfortunately, just as Hank and Britt are recognizing the EMO 
      TOUGH, he s recognizing them.  He turns and bolts.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    What s that about?

                                  BRITT
                          (shrugs)
                    Kid wants to be chased.

      They take off after him.  The chase begins.  

    And almost immediately ends.  Because the Emo-Tough goes 
      straight to his beat-up Toyotain the plant parking lot and 
      while he s digging for his keys, Britt appears --

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Hey.

    -- and Emo retreats the other way but Hank s standing there 
    so he chooses a third path: over the tops of a row of parked 
      cars, leaping from roof to roof.  

    On the ground Hank and Britt try to keep pace with him.

                                  HANK
                    Kid, get down from there.  
                      You re...endangering paint jobs.

    The Tough slips, drops his lunch box, keeps going.  On a 
      hunch, Hank stops to retrieve it.

      Ahead, another EMPLOYEE has pulled into work and the Emo-
      Tough leaps down, yanks him from his vehicle and gets in.  As 
    he hits the gas, the car door slams Britt in the shoulder.                                                                                    48.



                                  BRITT
                    Ahhh!

    The kid gets away.  Britt stands there, rubbing his shoulder, 
      watching him go.  Hank joins him, lunch box in hand.

                                  HANK
                    You okay?

                                  BRITT
                    No.  What s that?

                                  HANK
                    Kid dropped it.  Thought it might 
                    be important.

    He opens the box: a sandwich, an apple, a Thermos.  

                                  BRITT
                    He got away but he s gonnamiss 
                    three of the major food groups.

      Hank opens the last and sniffs, then offers it to Britt.

                                  HANK
                    What s that smell like to you?

                                  BRITT
                    Water.

                                  HANK
                    Exactly.

      Hank drains the Thermos, filled with tap water, to discover 
      several liquid-filled vials hidden inside.

                    And if they re slaughtered first?

                                  HEALTH INSPECTOR
                    Their meat becomes poisonous.

                    Jesus, they were trying to infect 
                    the flock, start a food scare.  
                    Someone s trying to ruin us.

                                  LEAD OFFICER
                    Any idea who might want to do that?

                                  CLEMMONS
                    No, but I bet theydo.

    He points to Hank and Britt, sitting nearby, held for 
      questioning.  They try to look as innocent as possible.

                                  HANK
                    Hey, Hopalong, we re the guys

                                  CLEMMONS
                    Or that s how you want it to look.
                          (to the Officer)
                    They say they re PI s but I never 
                    saw any ID.

                          (Hank mumbles them)
                    I m sorry, what was that?

      Hank knows they re fuckedand is about to speak clearly when:

                                  A VOICE
                    Hank Dolworthand Britt Pollack.

      Hank cringes: he didn t know they were thisfucked.That s 
      because DETECTIVE MARK GUSTAFSON has arrived on the scene. 
      Dark glasses, bull-chested, Philippe sFrench Dip still on 
    his breath.  He badges the lead officer.                                                                                    50.

                    Hello, Hank.

                                  HANK
                    Mark.  How are you?

                                  GUSTAFSON
                    OK.  Though someone used my name 
                    and ID yesterday to get some info 
                    out of the DMV.  Funny, they have 
                    this device called Caller ID helped 
                    them figure out who d done it.
                          (bigsmile)
                    Feel like going to jail?

                    Guess so.

      INT. HOLDING TANK - CITY JAIL - DAY

      Britt and Hank are in with other derelicts.  Britt keeps 
      vigil for the first knucklehead who tries to fuckwith them.  
    Off one guy s glance --

                    Hey, you walk over here, I will lay 
                    you out and shitin your mouth.

    No one s gonnafuckwith them.  Britt notices: Hank looks 
      burdened with a thought.  

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    You okay?  You look like somebody 
                    stole your monkey.

                                  HANK
                    Something about this is wrong.  
                    This job.  We re in over our heads.  
                    We re a couple of scroungers, get 
                    this back, find that person.  We re 
                    not bright enough for something big 
                    and this just became something big.

                                  BRITT
                    Cause some kids with too much eye-

      Hank and Britt exit alongside Bingham Lindus.

                                  HANK
                    Thanks, Mr. Lindus, for the bail.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Not at all.  Thank youfor your 
                    discretion at my plant, keeping 
                    Elenore s name out of it.  

      Hank s distracted by Gustafson across the parking lot.  He 
      waves -- see you soon --as he gets in his car.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS (CONT D)
                    Who s that?

                    Who threw us in jail.  
                          (backto the case)
                    We ve seen your daughter and she s 
                    fine.  Obviously this group she s 
                    caught up with is involved in more 
                    than just music.  Some sort of eco-
                        organic-terroristcabal.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    Any idea where she might be now?

                                  BRITT
                    We think wherever Laura Price is.  
                    If you could get her address from 
                    your supervisor, sir --

      Lindus produces it.

                                  BINGHAM LINDUS
                    He told me who you were asking 
                    after, so I...

                    Gentlemen, obviously my daughter s 
                    in a far more precarious situation 
                    than I first imagined.  If you can 
                    find her by the end of the day and 
                    get her away from this cabal, I m 
                    willing to offer you triple your 
                    normal fee.
                          (off their reactions)
                    You think you can do that?

    In answer to that question --

                    thought he was gonnacan us for

    of an old Volvo, bumper littered with stickers to recycle/end 
        war/impeach/save whales/go green/go vegan.  Pretty most days,

                    I met Elenore at a PETArally a few 
                    months ago.  She seemed nice, 
                    committed.  When she first started 
                    copying me, I was flattered. 
                    Dressing like me, adopting my 
                    causes as her own.

                                  BRITT

                    That s when it started getting 
                    weird.  Especially when I heard 
                    someone call her Laura.  Found out 
                    she was introducing herself as me 
                    at rallies, starting petitions in 
                    my name --

                                  HANK
                    -- getting jobs in your name?  
                            (she sconfused)
                    You ever been employed by Gibson 
                    Chicken Farms?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    Her dad s company?  Do I look like 
                    someone who would slaughter 
                    chickens for a living?

    Her place is wall-to-wall  Meat Is Murder  posters.

                                  BRITT
                    When s the last time you saw 
                    Elenore?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    A week ago.  She started talking 
                    about all the chemicals they put in 
                    the feed there and how it gave her 
                    mom leukemia and how she had a plan 
                    to scare people into never eating 
                    chicken again.  She was preaching 
                    to the choir and even I was freaked 
                    out.  I guess I didn t hide it very 
                    well.  A couple days later they 
                    tried to break in here.                                                                                    55.



    She indicates a door where a window panel has been broken and 
      a lock hammered at.

                                  BRITT
                    Who s they?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    Her little platoon of emo-freaks.  
                    They re like moonies, she s got  em 
                    wrapped around her finger.

      Hank and Britt study Laura: she seems genuine enough.

                                  HANK
                    Where are you going now?

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    My folks  place.  They re in Cabo 
                    for the week.

                                  HANK
                    They know a good lawyer? 

                                  LAURA PRICE
                    Probably.

                                  HANK
                    You re gonnaneed one.  The police 
                    are looking for you.
                          (beforeshe asks)
                    The less you know, the better.  Go 
                    home, call a lawyer, then go with 
                    him to turn yourself in.  Got it?

    She goes to her bathroom for a few final items.  Britt 
      wanders up to Hank, whispers:

                                  BRITT
                    You believe her?

      Hank nods.  Notices a rock club flyer on the fridge.  It 
      reads  Dirty Sanchez. 

                                  HANK
                          (calling out to her)
                    Hey, what s Dirty Sanchez?

                                  BRITT
                          (voice low)
                    Ah jeez, you don t wanna --                                                                                    56.



                                  LAURA PRICE
                    It s a band I used to like.  Guess 
                    who s dating the lead singer these 
                    days?

      Britt reads the flyer. 

                                  BRITT
                    Says they re playing tonight.

      Hank pockets it: they have their lead.

      EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

      Gretchen Dolworthsits at an outdoor table.  Hank rounds a 
      corner, stops to tuck in his shirt before approaching.

                                  HANK
                    Heya, beautiful.

      Right off he sees: his charm s not gonnawork for him here.  
      Gretchen s stiff as he kisses her hello.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Still pissed, huh?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    No.  Not at all.  Thanks for 
                    meeting me.  I m not keeping you 
                    from anything, am I?

                                  HANK
                    Got a few hours off.  Any luck this 
                    case llbe done by tonight.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Something interesting?

                                  HANK
                    If you find chicken empire 
                    heiresses with personality 
                    disorders interesting, sure.

      Hank waits for a smile; none comes.  But, it s true, she s 
    not angry.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    So the house...

                                  HANK
                    I apologize.  What I did was 
                      inappropriate.                                                                                    57.



                                  GRETCHEN
                    Thank you.

                                  HANK
                    It s just, I ve been thinking about 
                    making some changes in my life and, 
                    well, I kindagot carried away.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Changes like?

                                  HANK
                    Quitting my business.  

      That brings her up short, like Hank knew it would.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    You serious?

                                  HANK
                    As gingivitis.  Gonnahand it over 
                    lock-stock to Britt.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Why?  You love your work.

                                  HANK
                    It s stopped being fun.  Or I feel 
                    too old to find fun in it anymore.  
                    The romantic allure is gone.  Maybe 
                    I just realized that, running 
                    around like an idiot, my life 
                    hasn t added up to much.  
                          (he means that to resonate 
                          with her, and it does)
                    And why pull Britt down that hole 
                    with me?  Anyway, I will retract my 
                    bid on the house.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    No.  If you were buying it for you, 
                    go ahead.  It ll be easier actually 
                    than selling to someone else.  I 
                    just wanted to make sure you 
                    weren t buying it for me.

                                  HANK
                          (tries to laugh it off)
                    Buying it for you, whatya...

    She steels herself to share big news.  Before she can though:                                                                                    58.



                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    You re getting married again.

    She nods, gingerly.  He dies a little inside.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    When?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    This summer.  

                                  HANK
                    Do I know him?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    God, I hope not.  He s an architect 
                    downtown.  Lives in Hancock Park.

                                  HANK
                    How long has this been...?

                                  GRETCHEN
                    About six months.  You ll laugh at 
                    me: we met online.

                                  HANK
                          (all his strength to lie)
                    That s terrific, Gretch.Really. 

      Gretchen knows he s putting on a brave face.

                                  GRETCHEN
                    Anyway, I ll be moving in with him 
                    soon so I don t really need the 
                    house.  Look at the bright side: 
                    come June, you won t have to pay 
                    alimony. 
                          (she rises)
                    Thanks for understanding, Hank.

    She kisses him and goes.  Hank just sits there, deflated.

      EXT. ROOFTOP - KATIE S HOUSE - DUSK

      A VIEW THROUGH TREES OF A GOLF COURSE, amber light bouncing 
    off water, a final foursome on the 18th.  Katie sits on the 
      roof of her house, glass of wine in hand, taking in the 
      sunset: this is as close as she gets to living in luxury.

      Britt appears from the attic window, comes to sit beside her.

                                  BRITT
                    How dit go?  The mid-term?                                                                                    59.



                                  KATIE
                    Don t find out til Monday.

      They watch the sunset.  He borrows her wine for a sip.

                                  BRITT
                    Been thinking about us getting a 
                    dog.

                                  KATIE
                          (surprised)
                    Yeah?  Any particular breed?

                                  BRITT
                    Bulldog maybe, I don t know.  I 
                    thought we could go to the pound 
                    this weekend, pick one out.  All I 
                    know is I wanna name it after my 
                    Uncle Lassie.
                          (shesmiles)
                    I know it s not a baby.  But I 
                    figure it s a gateway 
                    responsibility.  You up for it?

    She nods.  He kisses her.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

                                  KATIE
                    For?

                                  BRITT
                          (shakes his head)
                    It d take too long.

      INT. ROCK CLUB - NIGHT

      MUSIC BLARES.  Hipster s on stage with his band, crooning 
      unintelligibly, his audience a nodding herd of emo s.

    In the back, by the bar, is Britt, baseball-capped, trying 
    not to look too old here.  He spies across the audience --

    -- Elenore Lindus, standing slightly apart from the others, 
      grooving with the music, exchanging smiles with Hipster.

      Britt exits.

      EXT. ROCK CLUB - NIGHT

    He joins Hank, waiting in the truck.                                                                                    60.



                                  BRITT
                    She s inside.  Now can we call 
                    Daddy Warbucksand end this thing?

                                  HANK
                          (looks around)
                    He shows up here, she s got seven, 
                    eight different escape routes. 

                                  BRITT
                    Is that ourproblem?

      Hank nods.  Britt sighs, settles in for the wait.

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      MOVING ALONG THE ROAD, the Hipster s Vespablows past us, 
      Elenore aboard, followed by a car filled with the rest of 
      Dirty Sanchez and their girlfriends.  Farther back Hank and 
      Britt keep pace in their Courier.

      EXT. UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE HILLS - NIGHT

    The caravan pulls into the driveway of a TWO-STORY FAMILY 
      HOME, and the emo cabal, seven strong, enter.  Hank and Britt 
      park down the street. 

      MOMENTS LATER, they re peering through a window.  In the 
      living room, the band s having a post-show party; in the 
      kitchen Elenore and Hipster prepare a plate of ecstacy.

                                  BRITT
                    Can we call him now?

      Hank takes out his cell and dials.  No signal.  He tries 
      again.  Still none.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Oh you gotta be --

      INT. FORD COURIER - MOVING SLOWLY- MOMENTS LATER

      Britt keeps the truck at a creep as Hank holds his cell out 
    the window, waiting for a signal to appear.  Nothing.

                                  HANK
                    Try around that bend.  Maybe if we 
                    get away from this hill.

      EXT. COMMERCIAL BOULEVARD - MINUTES LATER

      They ve had to come all the way down to the flats.  Hank, 
      with signal now, talks on his cell.                                                                                    61.



                                  HANK
                    412 Franklin.  Yes, sir.  No, she s 
                    not, there are about six other kids 
                    with her.  Okay.  We ll wait in 
                    front until you get there.
                          (hehangs up; to Britt)
                    He s twenty minutes out.

                                  BRITT
                          (7-11 across the street)
                    Wanna get a Slurpee?

      EXT. TWO-STORY HOME - NIGHT

      Emosretreat from living room to the basement.  Hank and 
      Britt watch, parked back in front of the house.  Hank once 
      again flips through the bed-and-bath catalogue.

                                  BRITT
                    So when Lindus gets here, gets his 
                    daughter, is that all she wrote?
                          (Hank doesn t understand)
                    Are you still quitting?

                                  HANK
                    Why, you chomping at the bit to 
                    have me gone?

                                  BRITT
                    No more than usual.

      A beat.  Hank remembers his coffee with Gretchen.

                                  HANK
                    Ah, you re right.  What the hell am 
                    I really gonnado besides this?

      Britt is secretly relieved.

                                  HANK (CONT D)
                    Heard this song today.

                                  BRITT
                    Please, no.

                                  HANK
                    Bum-bum-bum, bum-bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- would you quit, before --

                                  HANK
                    -- bum-BUM-bum-bum-BUM--                                                                                    62.



                                  BRITT
                    -- what is that --

                                  HANK
                    -- bum-bum-BUM-bum-bum--

                                  BRITT
                    -- you re just making that up --

                                  HANK
                    -- yes I am.

      Britt rolls his eyes.  And just then a MUFFLED GUNSHOT echoes 
      from inside the house.  Both men freeze.

                                                                            CUT TO:

    THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, as Hank and Britt slip through a side 
      gate.  They peer in windows: so sign of the emos.  

      They come to a door, locked.  Hank nods to Britt who launches 
    his elbow through a glass panel. He unlocks it; they enter.

      INT. TWO-STORY HOME

      Silence inside.  No movement.  Passing an entry table, Britt 
      picks up a framed photo: Laura Price and her parents.

                                  BRITT
                            (whispering)
                    Laura Price s folks  place?  The 
                    ones in Cabo?

    Our guys proceed to, through a kitchen and down to a BASEMENT 
    REC ROOM where they find --

    -- six freshly dead bodies, scattered in various poses of 
      death throes.  Hipster among them.  No sign of Elenore.

    The ecstacy plate lies conspicuously clean in the middle of a 
      pool table.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    Where s Elenore?

      Hank spies a light coming from within a bathroom.  He cracks 
    the door open --

    -- and there s a Blonde Girl slumped over, with a large hole 
      blown out the back of her head.  A revolver lies at her feet, 
      ostensibly dropped by her.  Hank tips her head back --

    -- it s Laura Price.                                                                                    63.



                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    That s --

                                  HANK
                    Not Elenore.

      They step back into the rec room, surrounded on all sides by 
      corpses.  They ve never seen anything like it.

                                  BRITT
                    Hank.  This is too big for us.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      HUSTLING WITH HANK AND BRITT as they tear ass out of here.

                                  BRITT (CONT D)
                    ...go, go, go...

      As they pass the framed photo on the entry table --

                                  HANK
                      ...fingerprints, fingerprints...

      Britt uses his t-shirtto wipe it down, then the door knob. 

      EXT. LAURA PRICE S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

    As discreetly as possible they rush back to their truck.  
      POLICE SIRENS approach in the distance.

                                  HANK
                          (noticing at last)
                    Vespa s gone.

      They drive off before the cops arrive.

      INT. FORD COURIER - MOVING - NIGHT

      Hank waits for his cell to get a signal again, then dials:

                                  HANK
                    Mr. Lindus?  Do notcome to the 
                    address I gave you, sir.  I can t 
                    explain over this phone.  Go home, 
                    we will come to you. 

    He hangs up.  Britt s and Hank s minds race.

                                  BRITT
                    What the hell did we just step 
                    into?                                                                                    64.



      EXT. LINDUS MANSION - NIGHT

    The Courier pulls up in front.  Shortly after they knock, 
      Lindus lets them in.  He s taken aback by their grim faces.

      INT. LINDUS MANSION - ENTRY WAY - CONTINUOUS

      When Lindus has closed the door behind them:

                                  LINDUS
                    Gentlemen, what s going on --

                                  HANK
                          (voice low)
                    Sir, you need to contact a criminal 
                    attorney now.  I m afraid your 
                    daughter may be in serious trouble.

                                  LINDUS
                    What kind of --

                                  HANK
                    The less you know the better.  
                    Elenore was with a group of 
                    friends.  Something happened.  As 
                    far as I know she s unharmed.  
                    However, we don t know where she is 
                    now.

                                  LINDUS
                    She s upstairs.  

      That stops them.

                                  HANK
                    I m sorry?

                                  LINDUS
                    She returned about thirty minutes 
                    ago, when I was out coming to meet 
                    you.  I came home, she apologized 
                    for disappearing like she did and 
                    went up to take a shower.
                          (theguys are bewildered)
                    If you don t believe me...
                          (he calls upstairs)
                    Ellie!  Can you come down here for 
                    a moment?!

    Our guys share a glance, then look up as Elenore Lindus 
      descends the stairs, robed, fresh out of a shower, towel 
      covering wet hair.                                                                                      65.


      It s her alright, same girl they saw at the rock club, same 
      girl who walked into Laura Price s family home tonight.

                                  ELENORE
                    Hello.

                                  LINDUS
                    Honey, this is Mr. Dolworthand Mr. 
                    Pollack, the men I hired to find 
                    you.  I just wanted to show them 
                    that you re home safe and sound.

                                  ELENORE
                    Not a scratch on me.  Sorry to put 
                    everyone to so much trouble, I m 
                      kindaembarrassed.  Can I go back 
                    up now, Dad?

                                  LINDUS
                    Sure, sweetie.

    As she goes back up, she pulls the towel from her head.  Hank 
    and Britt clock brown locks revealed beneath. 

      EXT. LINDUS MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

      Lindus sees them out.

                                  LINDUS
                    Gentlemen, I can t tell you how 
                    much I appreciate your work.  I 
                    don t completely understand what 
                    happened tonight but perhaps I m 
                    better off not knowing.  Regardless 
                    we had a deal.  Three times your 
                    fee for the safe return of my 
                    daughter by tonight.
                          (hehands them a check)
                    For your diligence and discretion.

    He bids them a good night, disappears inside.  Hank and Britt 
      just stand there, flummoxed.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Back at their truck, Britt paces as Hank thinks.

                                  BRITT
                      Bullshit.No way she was here half 
                    an hour ago.

                                  HANK
                    I know.                                                                                    66.



                                  BRITT
                    I wanna see if there s a Vespa
                    parked in that garage.  Daddy s 
                    covering for her, you know that?

                                  HANK
                    Probably.

                                  BRITT
                    Hank, we might be accessories to 
                    murder.  What are we going to do?

      A beat, then Hank comes to a decision.

                                  HANK
                    We re gonnaget in the truck and 
                    drive home.

      INT. COURIER - MOVING - NIGHT

                                  HANK
                    We re gonnakeep the check.  This 
                    isn t our fight.  We re gonnakeep 
                    the check because it solves a 
                    myriad of problems, shut our 
                    mouths, forget this ever happened 
                    and hope to God no one saw us 
                    leaving that house.

                                  BRITT
                    You sure?  If Gustafson ever finds 
                    out we left that scene, he will 
                    screw us and hard.  I ll go along 
                    with it because I could use the 
                    money.  But if we do this, we gotta 
                    do it all the way.  I don t wanna 
                    get a call from you some night 
                    saying you can t live with it.  
                    Okay?

      Hank nods.  

      EXT. HANK S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

      Britt drops Hank off for the night.  Before he gets out, Hank 
      offers his hand and Britt shakes it. 

                                  BRITT
                    Partner.

                                  HANK
                    See you in the morning.                                                                                    67.



      INT. HANK S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      A QUICK MONTAGE OF HANK GETTING READY FOR BED: he undresses, 
      brushes his teeth, splashes water on his face, turns off 
      lights in the hallway.

      INT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER 

    His clock reads 1:15 a.m..  He lies, head on his pillow, eyes 
      open.  Just as we met him.  

      Then he reaches over and grabs his cell off a bedside table 
    and dials.  After a moment:

                                  HANK
                    I can t live with it.

                                  BRITT S VOICE
                    Neither can I.
