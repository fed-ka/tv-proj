    date off of a digital desk calendar.  SATURDAY 3-26.
    We PAN further to reveal CLARK sitting at his desk which
    is covered with small stacks of papers and receipts.  He 
    works diligently, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt.  After 
    all, it's after hours.  Also on Clark's desk are two large 
    feet encased in sneakers.  They belong to JACK who sits 
    next to him glued to a computer game.  Enthusiasm is not 
    high.

    We HEAR a CRASH.  Neither Clark nor Jack seem phased as we 
    CONTINUE the PAN toward Perry's office.  There is a large     *
    pile of junk outside his door.

                              PERRY'S VOICE
                No, not that!

    A faded, cardboard elephant with an arrow on it's stomach
    lands on top of the pile.  PERRY retrieves his prized
    possession.  JIMMY is in the middle of the mess,
    overwhelmed.

    All eyes are glued to Fuentes' finger on the button.          *
    Clark can't make a move.  If he goes for the device, one
    of the other terrorists may shoot his friends. He tries
    to put a hand on Lois' shoulder for comfort but he's
    beaten by Luthor who protectively puts his arm around her.
    Clark and Luthor share a competative look as Lois leans
    appreciatively into the gesture.

                It's five against five.  I say we
                take 'em.  I bet that bomb's not

    Clark uses his _X-RAY VISION_ to see inside Fuentes' bomb
    but it is encased in lead and he can't see through it.

                I'll create a diversion, you hit

    She pushes him into a chair, and before anyone can stop,
    her she's banging on the windows trying to get attention.

                              LOIS

    She looks over at Perry who has no choice now but to play
    along.  He clutches his arm and breathes hard as Schumak
    enters.  Clark eyes him nervously as Schumak trains his
    weapon on Lois.

    Clark is about to lunge for Schumak when Fuentes and Remy     *
    come in.  Fuentes points his gun toward Perry and fires.      *
    Everyone is stunned silent.  A semi-circle of bullet holes
    appears around Perry's feet.  He is frozen in fear, no
    longer faking the coronary.  Fuentes smiles, satisfied.       *

                A nine millimeter automatic.

                There will be no more tests of my.

                She understand, sir.

    She throws Clark a dirty look then steps back toward 
    Luthor.  A loud NOISE by the elevators makes everyone 
    turn.  The other two terrorists, NEWBERRY and BLACKMAN are 
    moving heavy demolition machinery out of the elevator.

                Then what do you suggest, Mister

                Okay, see you tomorrow.

                              LOIS
                No, I mean, I have to _go_.

                              JACK

                No! Just since you mentioned it,
                thank you very much.

                They have to provide us with the

                              LOIS
                I don't think anyone told _them_
                that.

                              PERRY

    He lowers his glasses and aims his eyes at the sprinkler
    head.  At the last second, a loud TAPPING distracts him.
    He turns his head to see Lois knocking on the glass,
    getting her captor's attention.  Clark sighs, his
    opportunity lost as Remy enters, weapon poised.

                Too bad.

                Evidently my bladder didn't hear

    He takes his gun as he walks back to his work.  Remy walks 
    Lois roughly across the pit.  Clark and Luthor watch 
    closely as they disappear into the Ladies' Room.  Fuentes     *
    goes back to his computer, the device never leaving his 
    hand.

    Clark goes back to watching Fuentes while Luthor stays        *
    near the door.  He glances surreptitiously toward a red 
    EXIT sign over a doorway about thirty yards from him.  
    Then he looks at Fuentes who is emersed in in his work.       *
    Meanwhile Clark is ready to try his sprinkler trick again.

                              CLARK
                       (to himself)
                Stay in there, Lois.

    He lowers his glasses and turns his _HEAT VISION_ toward 
    the sprinkler head.  It begins to spray water on top of 
    Fuentes.  He recoils, dropping the nuclear device.            *

    Meanwhile, Luthor makes a run for the Exit.  Fuentes          *
    spots him, manages to pull his gun out and fire off 
    several rounds.  Clark, turns to see where the bullets are 
    headed.  Lex stumbles, just a few feet from the Exit door. 
    Fuentes, no longer hampered by the blast of air reaches       *
    the device easily.  Clark runs toward Luthor, followed by 
    the others.

                possibilites already?  The timing,
                the position, the speed, I've

                journalists have had this kind of

                just a casual observer.  Just like
                those guys in the Bagdhad Hotel.

    While she has been talking, Luthor has slowly slumped down
    beside her. His head now falls on her shoulder, eyes
    closed.

                This is ridiculous.

                              CLARK
                The oils and tannen from the tea
                leaves, combined with the
                peppermint from the gum and the
                ascorbic acid from the orange juice
                form a very potent healing mixture.
                Lois, there's no time.

    Flustered, she begins to peel the orange.  As everyone's
    attention is diverted to their tasks, Clark begins the
    real remedy.  He finds the bullet hole and, using his
    _HEAT VISION_, he cauterizes the wound.  Luthor comes to.     *

                              LUTHOR
                Kent?

                Don't worry, you're probably a
                little dizzy but you'll be fine.
                       (to the others)
                Is it ready?

    Lois holds the cup out.  Perry puts in the tea leaves and
    Jack puts in a wad of gum.  Clark takes Luthor's 
    handkerchief out of his pocket, wets it with the placebo 
    mixture, then places it on Luthor's shoulder.

                              CLARK (Cont'd)
                       (to Luthor)
                Careful, this could sting.

    Luthor winces.  Clark removes the handkerchief revealing a 
    nicely healed shoulder.

                              PERRY
                Well, I'll be damned.

    Lois, too, is amazed.  She looks at Clark.

                              LOIS
                       (sincerely)

                Lois, help me up.  I'm fine...

    Before he can finish, they are all shaken by a huge jolt.

                              LOIS
                What was that?

    It happens again.  Clark looks over at Fuentes who pulls
    out a walkie talkie, looking annoyed.

                              CLARK

    The music is loud, the gin flows and everybody shakes
    Dragonetti's hand.  The cigarette girl (Cat) flashes him a
    smile and he winks at her as the Maitre'd (Jimmy) comes up
    to him, looking slick in a dinner jacket.

                Look, maybe it's time I cashed out,
                took my share and just said goodbye
                to this town and this life.

                              DRAGONETTI/LUTHOR
                I don't think so.

                Half of what's in that vault is

                And if I let you take it, then the
                whole operation will only be worth

    Lily looks nervously from her magazine.  She and Bill         *
    share a worried look.  Bill takes a key chain out of his      *

    And with that he's off toward the exit door, silent and
    low to the ground, leaving Clark with an empty handcuff
    hanging from his wrist. He's angry at Jack, but more
    angry at himself for letting it happen. Clark looks at
    Fuentes, who's too busy to notice. He knows what he's         *
    got to do.

                Anyone but you.
                       (beat)
                I lost a lifetime because of
                Dragonetti and I swore, if I ever
                got out, I'd come back for what
                belonged to me.
                       (beat)                                     *
                Dragonetti got his due, though.                   *
                He was gunned down a week after I                 *
                went to prison.                                   *

    The others are engrossed in his story.

                              CLARK
                Willie, they're going to send you
                right back to prison for what
                you've done to us.

                              WILLIE
                But you weren't supposed to be
                here!
                       (to Fuentes)
                And you broke your promise.  You
                said no guns.

                              FUENTES
                I lied.
                       (beat)
                About a lot of things.

    Fuentes grabs Willie and cuffs him to the other side of
    Perry.

                              WILLIE
                Fuentes, what do you think you're
                doing?

                              FUENTES
                Sorry, Pops.  You're a liability.

                              WILLIE
                But I'm the one who told you about
                the vault in the first place.

                              FUENTES
                And I'll always remember you fondly
                for it.  But we've got to make a
                clean getaway and you're not
                exactly at your physical peak.

    Remy sticks her head out of the office.

                              REMY
                We're in.

                What about us?

                              FUENTES
                Remy!

    She comes over, carrying two bags.

                              FUENTES (Cont'd)
                I believe I've come around to your
                way of thinking. We'll take these
                up and meet you at the chopper.
                They're all yours.
                       (beat)
                Except her.

    Fuentes unlocks Lois' cuff.                                   *

                              FUENTES (Cont'd)
                We may need a hostage if anything
                goes wrong.

    Luthor tries to jump Fuentes but he's too weak.  Remy         *
    easily wards him off with a sharp blow.  Lois is at a
    loss.

                              LOIS
                You can't just kill them.

                              FUENTES
                You'd be surprised what you can do
                for a hundred million dollars.

    Remy points her weapon at the group.

                              REMY
                Get him up.  Let's go.

    Clark helps Luthor to his feet and carries him,
    half-conscious, toward the elevators.

                              LOIS

                I suppose this means I can't have

    Jack nods and as he is busy taking Luthor's weight, Clark,
    his back to the others, aims his _HEAT VISION_ at the
    light fixture.  SPARKS fly, the lights flicker, then off
    all together.

    We HEAR a short scuffle, then Jack opens a door
    letting light into the stairwell.  He looks at the cuffs
    dangling from his wrist.  Clark's is broken open.  He
    hides it from the others as they see Remy now unconscious
    and tied up next to Newberry.

    Clark is about to go out on the roof when Jack bursts

    Clark and Jack race to the edge. Fuentes and Lois are on      *
    a window washer's scaffold that hangs off the side of the
    building.  Fuentes still has the bomb in one hand which       *
    hinders his movement but he is above Lois preventing her
    from climbing back up.

                              CLARK

    Lois grabs his loose arm and fights for the device. In

    Lois falls off.  Clark jumps after her.                       *

    Lois and Clark sit at their desks.  A messenger brings a
    flower arrangement over.  She opens the card.  It
    reads: "Love, Lex." She looks at Clark who just keeps         *
    working.  CAT enters, her bubbly self.

                              CAT
                _What_ at a weekend.  I know he may
                not look it, but under that plain,
                mild-mannered facade, George is a
                wild man.
                       (confidentially)
                I spent most of the weekend in
                handcuffs.  So, what did you guys
                do this weekend?

    By this time, Lois, Clark, Jimmy and Perry are all just 
    glaring at her.  Lois starts to move toward her.

                Gee, sorry I asked.
