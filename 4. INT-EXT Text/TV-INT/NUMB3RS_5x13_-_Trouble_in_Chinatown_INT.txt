      dragon. TILT UP to find its artist, SIMON KRAFT, looking 
      dazed, as if channeling the drawing. 


      The place is busy, not full. As David and Colby enter, HARVEY 
      YOON (50s) approaches them with menus.

                                  COLBY
                    We re just doing takeout.

                                  HARVEY YOON
                    Same menu. 

      They grab a nearby table and look at the menu. 

                                  DAVID
                    What do you think?

                    is this, find me an egg roll.

                    needed a picture of that.

                    Yeah, that curd s looking a whole lot 
                    better.

      TWO ASIAN MEN WALK IN, long hair, furtive looks, bad guys 
      from the look of them. 

      The older of them, JIMMY LIM (40s), angrily approaches Harvey 
      Yoon at the cash register.  

                                  JIMMY LIM

                    Bie goi wo nei ge!  (Don t give me 
                    that!)

      The whole room s watching, especially David and Colby.

                                  HARVEY YOON
                    Ru guo nobu zou de hua, wo hui zhoo

                    Hoo, wo goi jong cha do dian hua.  
                    (Okay, I m calling the police.)

      Harvey Yoon grabs the phone. 

      JIMMY LIM looks to the YOUNGER BAD GUY. Both reach into their 
      jacket, pull out machine pistols and spray the room.

      INSTANT CHAOS: HARVEY YOON is blown away.  Waiters and 
      customers, are wounded, the spray of bullets reaching --

      DAVID AND COLBY -- pull their table over and duck behind it, 
      as a burst of bullets strafes their position... 

      ... then leap up and empty their handguns. 

      THE TWO BAD GUYS go down, dying... make that dead.        NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    5. 




      DON enters as Colby questions a wounded Waiter.

                                  COLBY
                    What were the shooters saying?

                    I don t really speak much Chinese, 
                    but it seemed like the leader guy was 
                    yelling,  Where s my girls, I want my 
                    girls back.  

      The younger bad guy s body is bagged.  David briefs Don.

                                  DAVID
                      6 wounded, 3 dead, counting the 
                    shooters.  Guns were FN P-90 machine 
                    pistols. These guys were planning a 
                    massacre.

      A cop calls Colby over to an older man in the background.

                    It s already all over Chinatown that

                    I think an agent of mine was just 
                    grabbed on this street. She was

      The doorbell RINGS. Charlie looks at his watch, it s late. 
      Amita clears the dishes. 

      Charlie opens the door and finds his old nemesis, Simon 
      Kraft, holding some mail.

                                  SIMON KRAFT

      Charlie nods, shuts the door, but Simon stops it with his 
      foot. Then hands Charlie the envelopes.

      Don, Colby, and NIKKI, are seated as Chen runs the room.  She 
      shows an ICE ID photo of Agent Kim Hsaio on the big screen.

                                  CHEN
                    The agent we re looking for is named 
                    Kim Hsaio.  She transferred to us 
                    from D.O.J. because she s Chinese-
                    fluent and...
                          (tinge of emotion)
                    Because I requested her.

      She shows two mug shots, the shooters from the Silk Dragon.

                                  CHEN (cont d)
                    Last night s shooters: That s Jimmy 
                    Lim on the left. He ran the Jade Boys 
                    gang with muscle from his cousin. 

      She shows a slide of a warehouse (the sweatshop.)

                                  CHEN (cont d)
                    Kim Hsaio was working undercover in 
                    Jimmy s sweatshop on Bernard Street. 
                    Till last night anyway. 

                                  COLBY
                    That waiter said Jimmy Lim was 
                    demanding his girls back from Harvey 
                    Yoon.  Was he talking about your 
                    missing agent?

                                  CHEN
                    It s possible. 

      On different screens she moves through a series of shots 
      showing Agent Hsaio walking with the two  van victims. 

                                  CHEN (cont d)
                      Department of Transportation cameras 
                    caught her all the way to Central 
                    Plaza, the restaurant s location. 
                    That s where DOT stops.

                                  NIKKI
                    And security cameras should kick in 
                    but on that corner of the plaza the 
                    cameras are all disabled.

      Chen, Colby, David and an ICE agent move stealthily down a 
      staircase, through a maze of moodily lit basement rooms 
      filled with machinery, boxes and excess bolts of cloth. 

                                  COLBY
                    Two floors of sewing machines and 
                    nobody here.  If this is a sweatshop,

                    Maybe they re all down here taking a

                    FN P90s. Same as the restaurant.

      CLOSE ON a pile of large cloth rolls.  Colby and David 
      pullback the fabric -- find --

      THREE BODIES, MALE ASIANS (20s) beat up and shot up.

      They HEAR the SOUND of activity coming from around a corner 
      and see a glow of flame. They rush over and find: 


      An arsonist at work. COLIN PANG (20s) has one blaze going and 
      is about to light another.  David jumps him as Colby attempts 
      to smother the flames with a piece of carpet, while Chen 
      finds an ancient fire extinguisher, which miraculously still 
      works.  They douse the flames.

                    I didn t know about the restaurant 
                    shooting till I heard it on the news.

      He hands Don another sketch but this dragon has something in 
      its stomach. Two  kewpie-doll  faces with dead, Asian eyes.

                                  SIMON KRAFT (cont d)
                    At first I thought they were Kewpie 
                    dolls, then I saw they were little 
                    dead girls. 

                                  DON
                    Whatever it is, it s not evidence. 

                                  SIMON KRAFT
                    You ve got lots of bodies out there, 
                    Don. And lots more to come.

      Simon leaves.

                    It took multiple noise filters to get 
                    that. We re stretching forensic 
                    audiology to the limit.

                    We can t use simple notch filters 
                    because of the overlap.

                    Some say the sound of the crows 
                    caused his final madness.

      AUDIENCE VISION

      Nikki at her computer. On her screen, a paint-by-the-numbers 
      version of Van Gogh s masterpiece depicting circling crows 
      over a golden field.  Mostly finished, Nikki  blacks in  the 
      outlines of several crows.

                    birds and clouds.  Make them larger 
                    and more densely packed.

      Nikki adds more crows, larger crows.

                                  NIKKI
                    I can t see my wheatfield.

                    The crop is immaterial, we know the 
                    field s there but now it s covered up 
                    by birds and clouds. To put it 
                    another way, your scene has become 
                    visually noisy.  How do you push 
                      foreground objects into the 
                      background?

                                  NIKKI
                    Well, in a graphics program -- 
                          (hitting keystrokes)
                    I d select the biggest crows, make 
                    them smaller and blurrier, so to the 
                    eye, they ll seem farther away.

      The foreground birds diminish into background birds.

                                  NIKKI (cont d)
                    And then I d select the clouds and do 
                    the same thing.

      She does, the clouds recede, revealing the golden wheatfield.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Result: we can better see the field.

                    sensitive to your job position but it 
                    is my agent who s missing. I want all

      Inside the facility, (guarded by TWO BEEFY SECURITY GUARDS), 
      they pass rooms full of YOUNG AND OLD PEOPLE participating in 
      crafts, Mah Jong, Tai Chi.

                    While the modern world wages its 
                    culture wars, we elders try to pass 
                    ours along. Or what s left of it.    
                    Our Cultural Center offers language

                    Tai Chi, most ancient of disciplines.

                    Mahjong. Some say the game goes back 
                    to Confucius. 

      They pause near THE MISSING WOMEN BOARD.  Each sad Asian face 
      captioned with a birthdate and a short physical description 
      and the words,  Have you seen her?  Nikki notices --

      A tragic OLDER COUPLE as they study the missing. The couple 
      look suspiciously at Nikki before they remove a poster of a 
      girl. They sorrowfully hand it to Yoon who nods with 
      understanding. The couple leave, hand in hand. 

                                  WALTER YOON (cont d)
                    They found her.

                    Why don t these parents go to the

                                  WALTER YOON
                    And be arrested?  Most are

                    And as a moral matter, many of these 
                    girls were charged $30,000 by a 
                    smuggler just to get here. They d 
                    rather be chained to a pimp or a 
                    sewing machine than be deported. My 
                    own mother was a sweatshop slave.

      Don drives, Colby next to him, the beacon locator between

                    Standard FBI search procedure. I d 
                    think a psychic would know that.

                                  SIMON KRAFT
                    I d think the FBI would have moved on 
                    since J. Edgar Hoover.

      Don almost rises to the insult, then backs away.

                    If we get within a mile of Hsaio we 
                    should get a ping off that beacon.

      Don and Colby pass a look.

                    I checked you out with your old 
                    employer. The CIA says you were 
                      discharged from the service for 
                    sexual assault.

                    What can I say, Don? I m a hugger.

      Suddenly, Simon jerks spasmodically, pressing his face 
      against the window; his eyes wide, vacant.  Don and Colby 
      spot the change.

      Nikki and Chen with three dead Kewpie-doll women all in a 
      row.  Two red dresses are in clear plastic evidence bags.  
      The Coroner finishes cutting off the dress from the last 
      victim.

                                    CORONER
                    How many women were found like this? 

                                  CHEN
                    Four so far.  What are you thinking?

                                    CORONER
                    Those two were injected with some 
                    form of paralyzing agent. I m good 
                    with poisons but I had to send this 
                    one out to the lab.  Resembles a 
                    shellfish toxin.  Conotoxin.

      Nikki puts on gloves, picks up an evidence bag.  The coroner 
      hands the cut dress to Nikki.

                    Look at this -- the mascara was 
                    applied thick and fast. See where 
                    some got in her eye?  Normally, that 
                    would cause tearing, the mascara 
                    would run. There s no smudge here.

                    Nikki was right about the tag from 
                    the red dress. It s a local loom. 
                    They said that particular weave was 
                      discontinued. The remainders were

                    nine is their most magical. It

                    We traced one victims s gown to a

      Amita and Charlie finish their take-out and read their 
      fortune cookies to each other. Larry studies a book. 

                                    CHARLIE
                     Lead with your brain but follow your 
                    heart.   Fitting.

                                  AMITA
                     Your dreams can t come true unless 
                    you wake up.  That s rather profound. 
                    Amazing creation, the fortune cookie.

                                  LARRY
                    Says in my book, it predates the Han 
                    dynasty.

                                  AMITA
                    Fortune cookies?

                                  LARRY
                    No, minghun. The marriage of the 
                    dead. What Walter Yoon did was a 
                      perversion of true minghun, where the 
                    people are already deceased. 
                      Astrologically suitable corpses keep 
                    each other company through eternity. 
                    There s a certain poetry in it.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Larry, you realize that sounds a 
                    little macabre.

                                  AMITA
                    I see what he means... in an Eastern 
                    sort of way.  Total strangers locked 
                    in eternal embrace, joined only by 
                    their connection to the stars.

                                  LARRY
                    Like my department at CalSci. 

      Don enters with a beer.

                                  DON
                    So what do we think about Simon 
                    Kraft?

                                  LARRY
                    That s a life that ends in a question 
                    mark.

                                    CHARLIE
                    The question being why does the human 
                    condition require a Simon Kraft?  
                    Watch the news-- Bigfoot, the Loch 
                    Ness monster.  Nothing on the great 
                    apes or blue whales, real marvels.  

                                  LARRY
                    I remind us, remote viewing and 
                    psychic warfare was the brainchild of 
                    respected researchers at Stanford.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I will fall on my slide rule if 
                    anyone can give me proof of Simon s 
                      extra-sensory abilities.

                                  LARRY
                    What inner power, do you suppose, led 
                    Simon to find the killer s van 
                    precisely at the moment of kidnap?

                                    CHARLIE
                    You mean the power that failed to 
                    warn him he was going to get run over 
                    by the van? 
                          (to Don)
                    Help me out here...

                                  DON
                    Sorry... you re going to have to move 
                    me into the  undecided  column on 
                    this one.

                                  AMITA
                    I m going to read my book in peace.

      She leaves, up the stairs, as --

                                  LARRY
                    Consider -- When Magellan landed on 
                    Tierra del Fuego, an isolated island, 
                    the villagers greeted him but mostly 
                    stared at the horizon. Having no 
                    concept of a ship larger than a 
                    canoe, they somehow couldn t see five 
                    galleons anchored in plain sight. A 
                    flotilla of ships were literally 
                    invisible to their disbelieving eyes.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 513/92 - "Trouble in..." - Rev. Yellow - 12/1/08    56. 

      CONTINUED: (2)4545

                                    CHARLIE
                    You illustrate my point. The ignorant 
                    couldn t see the plain truth in front 
                    of them. Or -- maybe an ocean fog 
                    concealed the ships. 

                                  LARRY
                    I can see the fog s rolled in 
                    alright. Good night, Charles. Don.

      Larry exits through the kitchen.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (regrets his earlier tone)
                    Good night, Lawrence. 

                                   DON
                    I m picking Dad up at the airport, 
                    want to come?

      Charlie nods, grabs his jacket.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Larry looks up at the universe and 
                    asks why. You take your doubts to the 
                    temple. 
                          (beat)
                    I don t know... maybe it s okay, 
                    living without all the answers.

                                  DON
                    I ll let you know... when I get some 
                    answers.

      The brothers go out the door together.
