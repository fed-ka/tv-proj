A radio hangs from a mail trolley. KATE, mid 40's, dressed in
a green uniform, turns into the path of a suburban house. She
passes a postman - who nods his head.
POSTMAN
Morning Kate. Looking lovely as
ever. If I was younger...
7.
KATE
Careful Paddy.
(pointing to her cheek)
Blushing! Is she up?
POSTMAN
Oh yes.
Kate smiles before unlocking the front door.
A busy High St. Kate moves amongst the throng boarding a bus.
A Taxi pulls away from the Terminal.
The Taxi pulls into the forecourt of a mid-market West End
London Hotel. Harvey gets out and pays the driver.
Kate, dressed for the evening, hurries along a street. Her
phone rings.
KATE
Mum?
KATE
Dungarees.
KATE
They're completely in again,
haven't you heard?
16.
KATE
(smiling)
Ok, mum. Thanks for the advice.
KATE
(frowns)
Ok, Let's talk about it later.
(beat)
I love you too.
Kate hangs up and crosses a busy road.
A cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant. Harvey
steps out, dressed in the same cream jacket, but now sporting
a pair of dark trousers. He looks like a bad lounge act. The
cab pulls away as Harvey turns towards the restaurant.
Harvey stumbles out of the restaurant and into a waiting cab.
The cab pulls away.
Kate exits the pub, just as a cab pulls up. As Harvey exits
one side, Kate gets into the other, as the cab pulls away
again.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
Carrying his case, Harvey hails a Taxi and gets in.
The Taxi comes to a stop in `classic' mid-day London traffic.
A Taxi pulls up. Harvey gets out, pays the driver and hurries
into the Terminal.
Harvey and Kate exit the restaurant. They stand opposite each
other in the quietening Terminal.
KATE
Thank you. I...enjoyed myself.
HARVEY
Yes. So did I.
Slightly awkward pause. Kate glances at her watch.
KATE
I should get going. I have a class.
HARVEY
A class?
KATE
(a bit sheepish)
Yes. A...writing class.
(beat)
Twice a week. Just something I do.
(changing the subject)
(MORE)
55.
KATE (CONT'D)
I take the Heathrow Express. What
about you?
Harvey hadn't really thought.
HARVEY
I don't know. I guess I'll stay in
a Hotel near here. My flight's in
the morning.
Beat.
KATE
Well...it's been a
pleasure...Harvey Shine.
HARVEY
Yes. Yes it has.
They shake hands, smiling. Just then Kate's phone rings
again.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
There's your phone again.
KATE
Yes.
(beat)
Sorry. I'd better go.
Kate turns and leaves. Harvey watches her go.
The train speeds past on its way into London.
They come to a stop outside. It's still light. A beautiful
fall afternoon.
KATE
Taxi's are over there. They'll take
you to wherever you need to go.
Harvey looks towards the Taxi rank.
KATE (CONT'D)
So, I guess it's goodbye again.
HARVEY
Yes.
(looks up at the evening
sky/beat)
So, I couldn't walk you to your
class, could I?
(beat)
Carry your books?
(beat)
Stand near the curb so you don't
get splashed.
Kate smiles.
KATE
Sure.
HARVEY
Is that a yes?
KATE
Yes.
(beat)
Why not?
Montage: Accompanied by a wonderfully romantic little ditty,
we watch from a distance as Harvey and Kate navigate the
buzzing streets of central London. All is alive and well.
Harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was
staying in before.
As they wander through the city, foreign students mingle,
policemen chat, and office workers linger. London is at its
best.
58.
The sky glows a pale orange as Harvey and Kate walk and talk
along the South Bank.
HARVEY
Yours is a beautiful city, Kate.
Kate looks at Harvey a moment, then smiles.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
What?
KATE
Its just a funny way of saying it.
Quite old fashioned.
HARVEY
Really?
KATE
But i like it.
(beat)
Yours is glorious country,
Honeychurch.
Harvey looks at Kate quizzically.
KATE (CONT'D)
It's a line from a book. `Room with
a View'.
Harvey shakes his head.
HARVEY
I'm afraid I'm not much of a
reader.
(beat)
Too fidgety, I guess.
Kate looks at Harvey.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
You think less of me.
KATE
No, we're just quite different,
that's all.
HARVEY
Is that bad?
59.
KATE
(thinks about it)
No.
Just then Kate's phone rings again.
HARVEY
Both our phones ring a lot. We have
that in common.
KATE
(smiles)
Ah.
They come to a stop as Kate takes out her phone and looks at
the handset display.
KATE (CONT'D)
Sorry. I should probably take this.
Harvey nods.
KATE (CONT'D)
Mum?
(beat)
I've been busy.
(beat)
No, I'm out. Yes with someone. No
someone else.
(beat)
Yes.
(looks at Harvey)
...a man.
Harvey smiles. We hear Maggie's warble continue as Kate
listens. Beat.
KATE (CONT'D)
You did, did you?
(beat)
An actual body.
Harvey looks at Kate. Kate shakes her head. Maggie continues.
KATE (CONT'D)
Mum. Listen. I'll come over
tomorrow and we can check it out
together.
(beat)
I have to go now. Just get an early
night and i'll see you tomorrow.
(beat)
I love you too.
60.
Kate hangs up.
KATE (CONT'D)
Sorry.
(beat)
My mother.
HARVEY
She worries about you?
KATE
And herself.
(beat)
She's convinced she's living next
to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy.
HARVEY
I see.
They start walking again.
KATE
She means well. She's just had a
tough run.
(long beat)
My Father ran off to France with
his secretary. Then mum got cancer,
about four years ago now. She's
fully recovered. But won't admit
it.
(beat)
She's basically bored. And my
continued `situation' as she calls
it, being single, is her major
distraction. Her pastime if you
will.
HARVEY
I see.
KATE
Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison
d'tre.
(grimaces/turns to Harvey)
Sorry.
HARVEY
No.
KATE
I talk too much.
61.
HARVEY
No. I like it.
KATE
Do you?
HARVEY
Yes.
Kate comes to a stop and looks at Harvey.
KATE
Hmm.
(beat)
Well, here we are. My class.
Harvey looks up at a grey municipal building.
HARVEY
How long is the class?
KATE
An hour.
HARVEY
Can I wait?
(beat)
Sorry - I promise I'm not
`Bundyish'.
KATE
(smiles)
It's getting cold. You don't want
to wait.
HARVEY
Yes I do.
KATE
(smiling and backing
towards the building)
Careful, I might get the wrong
impression.
Harvey shrugs.
HARVEY
What can you do?
62.
The door slowly opens. Maggie looks around then notices the
`thing' wrapped in paper on the ground. She quickly picks it
up and takes it inside.
As daylight fades, Harvey sits waiting. Through a large
ground floor window, he watches Kate, as her class wraps up.
As she comes out, he gets up and joins her.
HARVEY
How did it go?
KATE
Oh, the usual.
(beat)
Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us
the latest installment from his
Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all
tried to look at him in the same
way after.
Harvey smiles.
KATE (CONT'D)
Shall we keep walking?
HARVEY
Yes.
63.
Harvey and Kate walk under Waterloo bridge past the second
hand bookstalls. A man plays a saxophone melancholically.
KATE
Do you ever wish you could try a
different life?
(beat)
Just for a day. Just to see what it
would be like.
HARVEY
What would yours be?
KATE
(looks down at her
uniform)
Well, no green, that's for sure.
Harvey smiles.
KATE (CONT'D)
(beat/thinks)
It would take place in Spain. A
little house inland.
HARVEY
And what would you do there?
KATE
Oh...I don't know...
(beat)
Write the great novel.
(beat)
I think I've got one inside me.
We're not talking high art. Just a
bloody good holiday read.
Beat.
HARVEY
Ok. So this house in Spain would
have a little cabana looking out
over the plains for you to write
in.
KATE
(smiling)
Yes.
64.
HARVEY
And a little stream running by, to
bathe in.
KATE
(smiling)
Sure.
HARVEY
I'm there.
(beat)
Sorry, that's if you're receiving
guests.
Kate smiles, coming to a stop.
KATE
Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine.
HARVEY
Why, thank you Kate Walker.
Just then a sort of Skiffle come Rockabilly busking act
starts up. Two girls and a guy. They're great! Harvey and
Kate stand amongst the crowd watching. The South Bank is at
its vibrant best.
With the sound of the Skiffle act still playing in the
distant background, Harvey and Kate take a seat on some steps
over-looking the river. As darkness descends, street-lamps
reflect off the water. They sit in silence. Then...
KATE
What happened Harvey?
(beat)
Between you and your daughter?
Beat. Harvey shakes his head.
HARVEY
I don't know.
(beat)
Somewhere along the way I lost her.
I lost my family.
(beat)
I just woke up one morning and
realised i didn't belong.
Beat.
65.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
I'd always had this mean little
feeling in my stomach, that they
were a bit embarrassed by me.
(beat)
If you saw them now, with Brian,
Susan's step-father. You'd see,
they make more sense. They look
right together.
Beat. Harvey looks out over the Thames.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
I've not been a great father.
Kate looks at Harvey's sad profile. Beat. She thinks for a
moment.
KATE
The reception. It's still going on?
HARVEY
(looks at his watch)
I guess.
KATE
Where?
Harvey looks up.
HARVEY
The Grovesnor. Why?
Kate looks at Harvey.
KATE
You must go.
HARVEY
What?
KATE
What the hell are you doing here?
You must go!
Harvey shakes his head.
HARVEY
She doesn't need me.
66.
KATE
Stop feeling so sorry for yourself.
She's your daughter, you're her
father. Go!
Harvey shakes his head again. Kate is not about to give up.
KATE (CONT'D)
Harvey, it would be unforgivable
not to go.
Beat.
KATE (CONT'D)
Harvey?
HARVEY
Wait. I'm thinking.
(beat)
Only if you come with me.
KATE
What?
HARVEY
Please, come with me. As
my...bodyguard.
(smiles)
As my friend.
Kate momentarily blushes, then shakes her head.
KATE
Harvey, firstly, i'm not about to
go to anyone's wedding in a green
polyester work suit. Secondly it's
not right.
HARVEY
We'll find you a dress. If we find
you a dress, will you come?
KATE
No.
HARVEY
Please.
KATE
No.
HARVEY
Please.
67.
KATE
No.
Music/Montage: The song is the same as that played by the
buskers. It's a fast, fun Rockabilly Skiffle thingy. We watch
as Harvey and Kate buy a dress. (Handheld/Double speed).
A Taxi pulls up and out step Harvey and Kate. Kate looks
fantastic on Harvey's arm as they walk up the front steps.
Harvey and Kate join the rest of the congregation outside on
the steps of the hotel. Harvey looks on as his daughter and
son-in-law head to an awaiting car. Susan stops and throws
the bouquet behind her. It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in
turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey's `all grown up'
niece. She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of
braces on her teenage teeth.
Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye. And is about to
get into the car when she stops and hurries over to Harvey.
SUSAN
Bye Dad.
HARVEY
Bye Suz... Bye Susan.
She hugs him tightly. Pulling away she turns to Kate.
SUSAN
Be gentle with him.
Kate nods as Susan turns to leave.
HARVEY
(to Kate)
Sorry.
79.
Kate smiles. As the car pulls away, everyone
cheers. Harvey
looks on. His eyes momentarily lock onto his
ex-wife's. They
share a conciliatory look. As Harvey watches
his daughter's
car disappear down the street, Kate looks at
him. He turns
back. Beat.
KATE
You Ok?
HARVEY
Yes. Yes, I am.
Beat. Harvey looks around.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
You wanna get out of here?
KATE
Sure.
Harvey and Kate walk. The streets are quiet. There is already
a hint of dawn in the sky. Rubbish trucks manoeuvre.
They turn into the courtyard of Sommerset House and take a
seat on some chairs. The sky lightens.
KATE
I don't think I've stayed up all
night since I was a student.
They stare out over the courtyard. Silence. Harvey looks at
Kate for a beat.
HARVEY
You got sad. Why?
Kate looks back at Harvey and tries to read him. She looks
down at her lap, then up, out over the courtyard.
KATE
Oh, I don't know. My uniform's
green?
The sun begins to creep above the buildings. Harvey and Kate
look out across the courtyard.
80.
KATE (CONT'D)
I was pregnant once.
(beat)
I didn't have it. Didn't give it a
moment's thought.
(beat)
That's what smart girls did.
Beat.
KATE (CONT'D)
I do sometimes wonder what they'd
be like today.
(beat)
Whether they'd be smart. Funny.
Serious.
(beat)
I don't know, it's silly.
Harvey looks at Kate in the morning light. Kate blushes and
looks away.
KATE (CONT'D)
I don't know why i just told you
that.
HARVEY
No.
(beat)
I'm glad.
Harvey looks away, then back.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
Meet me here, tomorrow.
KATE
What?
HARVEY
Exactly here, at these chairs. At
noon.
Kate smiles, determinedly trying to keep it light.
KATE
What about your flight, Harvey?
HARVEY
I don't want to leave.
(beat)
Guess why.
81.
KATE
Why?
HARVEY
I wanna be with you.
Kate's blush deepens, she looks away and laughs.
KATE
Shut up, Harvey.
HARVEY
It's true.
Kate glances at Harvey, trying see the truth in his eyes.
KATE
You say that now, but wait until
tomorrow.
HARVEY
Today is tomorrow.
KATE
Harvey we know nothing about each
other. You're...
HARVEY
Old?
KATE
A bit older, yes.
(beat)
I can be mean. Really mean.
HARVEY
So can I.
KATE
No. Truly cantankerous.
HARVEY
So can I.
Kate can't help but smile. Beat. She glances towards the
street.
KATE
(standing)
I should be going.
82.
HARVEY
I know enough to know, I'll be
here. Waiting, at this chair.
Kate looks at Harvey, then again towards the street.
KATE
Sure, Harvey.
HARVEY
Noon. I mean it.
(beat)
I'll be here.
Kate smiles a little smile. She suddenly believes him.
KATE
Ok.
She steps backwards.
HARVEY
Wait.
Harvey gets up and joins her. They look at each other. Harvey
suddenly leans in and kisses Kate.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
(pulling away/can't help
smiling)
Sorry.
Kate smiles.
KATE
Harvey Shine.
HARVEY
Can I have something until
tomorrow.
Kate reaches for her purse and pulls out a photo. She gives
it to Harvey.
KATE
(stepping backwards)
I must go.
She turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus.
Harvey stands holding an old library card. He looks down. On
it is a faded photo of toothy young girl, no older than
eleven. Harvey looks up and smiles.
83.
Harvey, with a croissant lodged in his mouth and a cup of
coffee in hand, buys a morning paper. He turns and crosses
the road, skipping up the steps of his hotel.
Kate, with a skip in her step, walks through the bustling mid-
day streets of London. She stops off and buys a bag of
cherries from a `Fruit & Veg' vendor.
As the porter and concierge talk to a medic, Harvey sits in
the back of an ambulance. The door is closed.
Kate sits waiting, expectantly, on the same chairs they had
sat on earlier. She applies some lipstick.
As time passes, we watch as Kate's expression slowly turns
from expectant to resigned.
Kate looks on as some kids play in the fountain nearby. She
self-consciously smooths a fold in her skirt, then looks at
her watch. Beat. She looks down at the brown paper bag of
cherries. Suddenly a resigned smile flashes across her face -
she's been here before  nothing new.
Kate gets up and leaves. We watch her walk away.
FADE TO BLACK.
Sound of a vacuum cleaner.
FADE IN:
Kate exits her mother's house and passes Paddy the Postman.
PADDY
Morning Kate.
KATE
Morning Paddy.
PADDY
Looking lovely as ever.
KATE
(resigned)
Thank you.
Kate walks off down the street.
Harvey exits the Hospital.
HARVEY
(calling out)
Taxi!
A taxi pulls up.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
Heathrow please. As quick as you
can.
Harvey gets in as the Taxi speeds away.
A Taxi pulls up. Harvey hurries out.
Harvey alights from the Taxi, paying the driver. He runs.
Harvey hurries towards the Southbank.
Kate comes down from the upper terrace of the National,
saying her good-byes to her classmates. In her hand she holds
a book. As she turns she sees Harvey coming to a stop in the
distance. She momentarily falters before approaching.
KATE
Hey.
HARVEY
Hey.
93.
KATE
You're still here - still in
London...
HARVEY
Yeah.
(beat)
Kate, I just wanted to apologise
and explain...
KATE
No, you don't have to - explain -
it's fine -
HARVEY
No, but I do -
KATE
I don't need to hear - it's fine,
seriously.
HARVEY
But I want to...
(comes out)
I had to go to Hospital.
KATE
Oh, God! Why?!
HARVEY
No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just
forgot to take my pills. I have
this condition, I've had it since I
was a kid - it's an irregular heart-
beat sort of thing.
KATE
Arrythmia.
HARVEY
Yes! How do you know what it is?
KATE
(smiling a little
sheepish)
My...My father has it.
HARVEY
(smiling)
Well, young men get it too.
Kate can't help but smile. Beat.
94.
HARVEY (CONT'D (CONT'D)
Kate, I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
Beat. Kate takes a breath, and gives him the practical
response she's gone over in her head.
KATE
Harvey, I like you, I really do.
And I had a lovely time - it was
great. But, you know, I don't
really do fountains at noon.
(beat)
I live in Willesden. And you live -
in -
HARVEY
White Plains.
KATE
Exactly. And we're not teenagers,
so - you know, monday morning and
life kicks in, all that jobs and
family and brown envelopes with
bills in - it was a lovely day and
I won't forget it, but it's not
exactly real life...
HARVEY
It is. It can be.
KATE
No, Harvey, it's not.
Beat.
HARVEY
Kate, I want this. I want you.
A button is pushed in Kate.
KATE
But it's not just about you, is it?
(beat)
You don't know anything about me.
Look at me. It's pathetic. I
expected you not to show for God's
sake. I think I even wanted you not
to be there, it's easier that way.
(beat)
You - you just dive in wherever,
deep end, whoosh. But, I'm not your
bloody swimming pool Harvey.
(starting to break)
(MORE)
95.
KATE (CONT'D)
And I am not going to do it, I'm
not going to do it because it will
hurt. Not right now, maybe, but
soon - there will be a "it's not
quite working is it" or a "I need
some space" or whatever it is and
it'll end and it'll hurt and I
won't do it, I won't and...I...Oh
fuck, I don't want to cry. I don't
want this...
Kate turns and walks away, standing by the balustrade,
looking down at the river below. Harvey watches. She takes a
seat on a bench. Harvey gives her, her space. Then slowly he
approaches, leaning against a tree nearby. Long beat.
KATE (CONT'D)
I think it's actually easier for me
to be disappointed. I think I'm
actually angry at you for trying to
take that away.
Long beat. Just then Kate's phone rings. She reaches into her
bag and takes it out. She stares at the phone, thinking for a
beat, before answering.
KATE (CONT'D)
(firmly)
Mum, I love you, but not now.
She hangs up. Long beat.
HARVEY
Should I take that as a hopeful
sign?
Kate can't help but smile.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
If you just give me a little wider
smile.
KATE
(smiling/laughing)
Oh, shut up, Harvey.
Beat. Kate collecting herself, looks up at Harvey.
KATE (CONT'D)
So how's this going to work, Mr
Shine?
Beat.
96.
HARVEY
I have absolutely no idea...
(beat)
But it will.
(beat)
I promise you that.
Kate stares at Harvey for the longest while. Then...
KATE
Shall we walk?
Beat. Harvey nods.
HARVEY
Yes.
Kate gathers up her things, stands and joins Harvey. They
begin to walk.
After a short while Kate stops, puts her hand on Harvey's
shoulder and takes off her shoes.
KATE
That's better.
Harvey glances down at Kate's feet, then up at her.
HARVEY
I think you're my kinda girl.
Harvey and Kate smile. And as they walk away from us we hear.
HARVEY (CONT'D)
Why don't you ask me those
questions?
KATE
Which ones?
HARVEY
You know, from the airport. When I
wouldn't stop.
KATE
Oh, the questionnaire.
(beat)
Ok. Name?
HARVEY
Harvey Shine.
97.
KATE
Place of residence?
Beat.
HARVEY
I'm in transition.
We watch as Harvey and Kate disappear into the sea of
London...
