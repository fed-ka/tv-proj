      TITLE: CHESS

      INT. FARADAY BEDROOM - MORNING

    The shrill BEEP-BEEP-BEEP of an alarm clock. Its 5am.

      VINCE FARADAY (30s, capable) turns over in bed, expecting to 
      find his wife, instead finding his 8-year-old-sonTRIP 
      staring back at him.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to Trip)
                    What reyou doing here?

                                  TRIP
                    Bad dream.

      INT. KITCHEN - FARADAY HOME - MORNING

      VINCE sips his coffee, watching the news. TRIP watches his 
      Dad. He likes to watch his Dad get ready for work. Vince 
      absently puts HANDCUFFS and a HOLSTEREDPISTOL in his belt.

                                  NEWS 7 REPORTER (V.O.)
                    ...to show that City Hall is 
                    dealing with rampant police 
                    corruption in several of its 
                    precincts and a spiralling crime 
                      epidemic...

    ON SCREEN: Images of PALM CITY. Crime tape surrounding chalk 
      marks on the ground.

                                  NEWS 7 REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...Mayor Welkins will introduce his 
                    new top cop, Chief of Police Tom 
                    Ross, at a press conference today.

      Trip pours himself some cereal. Watches news.

                                  NEWS 7 REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Ross is widely given credit for 
                    turning around Valley Ridge and New 
                    Belmont but this will definitely be 
                    his greatest challenge yet...

      Vince finishes his coffee. He leans down and plants a kiss on 
      Trip s head. Heads off.                                                                                    2.


                                  TRIP
                    Bye Dad!

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

      VINCE walks through an office bustling with activity. It s an 
      important day. All hands on deck.

      A FEMALE DETECTIVE hands Vince a piece of paper.

                                  FEMALE DETECTIVE
                    Just to start your morning right.
                          (beat, re: paper)
                    Death threat to the Mayor.

      Faraday studies printout. Frowns.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (reads name)
                    Guy calls himself Chess? That s 
                    cute.
                          (pause)
                    He s got the Mayor s internal 
                    schedule.

                                  FEMALE DETECTIVE
                    We gave that to the press.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    In a press release. This schedule 
                    came from inside the Mayor s 
                    office.
                          (beat)
                    Better take this upstairs.

      INT. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - DAY

      VINCE FARADAY enters the office as ROSS - the new Top Cop of 
      Palm City - looks over his speech.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Sorry to bother you, Chief. 

                                  ROSS
                          (doesn t look up from 
                            speech)
                    What s up?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (holds up paper)
                    Threat to the Mayor came in.

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                    Calls himself  Chess.  He s got 
                    today s event schedule. That hasn t 
                    been released.

                                  ROSS
                    We don t flinch. Not today.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (pause, pockets the paper)
                      Understood.

                                  ROSS 
                          (puts speech down, picks 
                          up two pieces of paper)
                    I m like Santa Claus here, Faraday, 
                    I ve got two lists. Cops who ve
                    been Naughty and cops who vebeen 
                    Nice.

      Ross holds up a sheet of paper with two hundred names. And a 
      sheet of paper with five names.

                                  ROSS (CONT'D)
                          (shakes two hundred names)
                    Naughty.
                          (shakesfive names)
                    Nice.
                          (beat)
                    That s a lot of coal.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Yes, sir.

                                  ROSS
                    I ve never seen corruption like 
                    this and I m no boy scout. So what 
                    the hell have I gotten myself into?
                          (holdsup his hand)
                    Don t answer that. 
                          (beat)
                    I need someone I can trust.
                          (glancesat paper)
                    I ve read your performance reviews. 
                    Outstanding. Says here you have a 
                    military background. Army Rangers. 
                    Special Operations?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (nods)
                      Unconventional warfare.

                                  ROSS
                    Good. We face an unconventional 
                    war.

                          (beat)
                    So what s the deal? You some kind 
                    of hero? Think you re just better 
                    than everyone else? 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    No, Chief.

                                  ROSS
                    So why? Why stay clean? Better yet: 
                    why s this city worth saving?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (pause)
                    I played ball on DitmussAvenue. My 
                    son goes to Radnor Elementary. My 
                    wife grew up over the hill in 
                    Baldwin. It s home.

                                  ROSS
                    You married up.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    She ll tell you that.

                                  ROSS
                    All right, Faraday, get out. I m 
                    gonnalean on you. Make us proud 
                    today. Need to read this stupid 
                    damn speech.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. ROOFTOPS - PALM CITY - DAY

      SWAT SNIPERS train their scopes on any open window. A CROWD 
      gathers below. We hear VOICES amplified by microphones.

      EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - PALM CITY - DAY

      ROSS - THE NEW CHIEF OF POLICE - is at the podium in the 
      middle of his speech. THE MAYOR is flanked by UNIFORMED 
      POLICE. REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS fill the steps. There is 
      a serious law-enforcement-presence on the streets.

      PALM CITY has a coastal sunniness and allure. A mixture of 
      sleek skyscrapers and white-sand-beaches. It could be LA or 
      Miami. A world just like ours. But just beneath the 
      surface...a cancer grows.

      ACROSS THE STREET: VINCE FARADAY watches the speech and the 
      sidewalks with TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS.                                                                                    5.


                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to cops)
                    Get somebody on that north corner. 
                    We re looking a little thin there.

                                  OFFICER #1
                    On it.

    The officer jogs down the closed-off-street. Vince is uneasy.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to remaining cop)
                    Why show off that you ve got the 
                    mayor s schedule? What s the point 
                    of that?

                                  OFFICER #2
                    Look at all this press. He wants 
                    the attention. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Guy names himself Chess, though. I 
                    studied chess - the game - a lot in 
                    military theory classes. 

    The press conference is over. The Mayor is whisked down the 
      stairs. Flashbulbs POP. Police fan out to their cars. A 
      UNIFORMED OFFICER heads towards Vince.

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                          (still talking to cop)
                    Key piece of Chess strategy is 
                    disguising your true objective. Get 
                    your opponent to defend his...
                          (notices something, stops 
                          an approaching officer)
                    Jenner, what reyou doing? You and 
                    Garcia are my bodies on the Chief.

                                  JENNER
                          (confused)
                    You just called me off it.

    The Chief of Police shakes hands. Ducks into a black sedan.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    The hell I did!

      INT. BLACK SEDAN - DAY

    THE CHIEF OF POLICE loosens his tie in the passenger seat.                                                                                    6.


                                  CHIEF OF POLICE ROSS
                    Let s roll.
                          (beat, jokes)
                    Hope that Chess moron had a front 
                    row seat.

      Ross smells something. He turns around and sees...

      ...an officer - GARCIA - dead. A smoking hole in his chest.

      Ross turns to THE DRIVER who takes off his sunglasses. He 
      wears freakish contact lenses - A CHESS SYMBOL IN EACH EYE - 
      a rook and a knight. 

                                  CHESS
                    Backstage pass.

      Before the Chief can react there s a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE in his 
      neck and a poison pushing into his carotid artery.

      EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - PALM CITY - DAY

      VINCE jogs towards the black sedan which PEELS out in 
      reverse, suddenly.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (into radio)
                    He s got the Chief!

    The black sedan SQUEALS around the corner. Vince races after 
    it on foot. Officers scramble.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. FARADAY KITCHEN - NIGHT

      A haggard VINCE FARADAY enters the kitchen. Wife DANA (30s, 
      pretty, no pushover) gives him a well-needed-hug.

      INT. BASEMENT - FARADAY HOME - NIGHT

      Under a bare bulb VINCE twirls two police truncheons and 
      assails a hanging bag. Heavy blows. Vince is covered in 
      sweat. Hands taped. He drives knees into an unseen enemy. He 
      uses the truncheons with deadly accuracy. Substitutes his 
      fists. This is a guy with advanced and unique fight training.

      After exhausting himself he hears a floorboard CREAK...

      ...Vince turns to TRIP on the stairs. His small hands are 
      taped too. Vince gestures for him to come over.

      Trip walks over. Punches the bag.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (gently)
                    Good. Turn the hips.

                            demonstrate)
                    Boom.

      Trip whacks it again. Gives it his all.

                    Better.

      Trip punches it again. Again. Hard. Vince watches. Proud.                                                                                    8.

                    I know you ll get him, Dad.

      Vince pulls Trip into a hug. Cradles his head to his stomach.

                                  TRIP (CONT'D)
                    Love you.

      DANA is in the bathroom. Dries her face. VINCE is in bed. 
      They re in the middle of a discussion.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I thought you d be happy.

                                  DANA
                    I just want to know it s what you 
                    want. You ve always wanted to be a 
                    cop.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I d still be a cop. 

                                  DANA
                    A private cop. A corporate cop.

                    How can I do my job if I can t 
                    trust the guy next to me?

                                  DANA
                    No, I get it.

                    Lynx Corporation runs a tight ship. 
                    Everyone says they re taking over 
                    the force in six months. I get in 
                    now. Good benefits. Time off.

      Dana climbs onto the bed.

                                  DANA
                    Time off? What s that?

                    changed a light bulb in two years.

      Vince curls Dana into his arms. Kiss. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (means this)

                    What? I thought that sounded good.

      Vince kisses her. Dana kisses him back, presses against him.

                    let s see if you re still a cop, 
                    Vince. We ll be in touch.

    The screen goes black. Vince considers all of this.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY PIERS - NIGHT 

      A sleepy and annoyed MARTY VOYT pulls up in his SUVto an 
      abandoned warehouse on a lonely pier. VINCE waits by the 
      curb, blowing on his hands for the chill.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    It s 3am, Vince.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    You alone?

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    No, there s five guys in the trunk. 

      Vince turns and heads over to a warehouse where the front 
      door is ajar. Marty studies the chain lock which is cut.

                                  MARTY VOYT (CONT'D)
                    Did you clip this chain?

                                  VINCE FARADAY (O.S.)
                            (alreadyinside)
                    Come on.

      INT. WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY PIERS - NIGHT

      MARTY VOYT follows VINCE, warily.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                          (stops walking)
                    I m sorry, I m getting a little 
                    nervous.

      Vince stops at a few opened brown boxes labeled: PAMMYPEES.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Look inside.                                                                                    16.


      Marty glances inside the box, takes out a PammyPees doll.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                          (reads box)
                    PammyPees, hours of toilet-
                      training-fun.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Open the box.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    This is illegal, Vince. This is not 
                    my idea of the 21st century police--

      Vince takes the box from Marty, tears it open, takes out the 
      PammyPees doll and - carefully - pulls off the head.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (hands over the doll)
                    I don t know about you: I m 
                    thinking recall.

      Marty looks inside the doll body, tilts it and out slides a 
      STEEL CANNISTER with a chemical name on the label as long as 
      your arm and NERVE AGENTprinted prominently upon it.

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                    It s a weaponizedshell filled with 
                    - what I think is - VX gas. I ve 
                    checked six boxes. All the same.
                          (beat)
                    What s Peter Fleming need a 
                    warehouse full of nerve gas for?

      Marty looks around at all the boxes. Back at Vince.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    You re talking about a multi-
                          billion-dollar-corporation. Has a 
                    lot of moving parts.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    In this city those moving parts 
                    seem to include organized crime and 
                    chemical weapons. Marty, I m sorry. 
                    You re my friend--

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    Let me get on the phone with Mel 
                    Thomas over at the Bureau, find out 
                    what the hell is going on. You go 
                    home. I ll call you in two hours.                                                                                     17.


      Marty exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BEDROOM - FARADAY HOME - NIGHT

      VINCE lays in bed, still in his clothes. DANA sleeps beside 
      him. The clock reads 5:45 AM. Vince closes his eyes.

    The phone RINGS. Vince answers immediately.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Yeah?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. FREIGHT YARD - PALM CITY - NIGHT

      VINCE exits his car at a rail yard. He checks that his GUN is 
      loaded and stuffs it in the back of his pants. He walks 
      between heavy freight cars. In the distance a TRAIN WHISTLES.

    In the maze of cars, Vince passes one with a once-garish, now 
      fading poster for an old carnival exhibition: MAX MALINI S 
      FANTASTIC ODDITIES AND AMAZEMENTS!

                                  MARTY VOYT (O.S.)
                    Vince.

      Vince turns to an open freight car. MARTY waves. Vince heads 
      over. Marty helps him up. Vince sees tears in Marty s eyes.

                                  MARTY VOYT (CONT'D)
                    I m sorry--

      A hypodermic is in Vince s neck before he can reach his gun. 

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:

      INT. FREIGHT CAR - RAIL YARD - NIGHT

      VINCE gasps awake. He s tied to a chair. 

      CHESS sits in front of him. He wears a tight black mask over 
    his face. Only his eyes with the disturbing contact lenses 
    are visible. There is a chess board in front of Vince.

      Vince looks around and sees MARTY in the shadows.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                      Marty...what d--? 

      Marty says nothing, stares at his shoes.                                                                                    18.


                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                          (sees chess board, to 
                          Marty)
                    What did you do!?

                                  CHESS
                    Do you play Chess?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (looks at Chess, slowly)
                    I m...not good.

                                  CHESS
                    I ask because you have an 
                    aggressive opening. In the game I d 
                    call it a Latvian Gambit. You 
                    forced me to finetunesome things. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    What s the plan for the VX?

                                  CHESS
                    But we re in the Middlegame.Pawns 
                    become crucial. And out of your 
                      inexperience, you left your 
                      king...vulnerable.

      Vince absorbs this. Thinks of his family.

                                  CHESS (CONT'D)
                    My life is a chess game that I play 
                    against myself. I m a little like 
                    Lancelot on the bridge. Waiting for 
                    the one who will challenge me. 

      Chess pulls off his mask TO REVEAL...

      ...PETER FLEMING- Chairman and CEO of Lynx Corporation.

      Vince s jaw falls open. LYNX TROOPS step forward from the 
      shadows. Peter Fleming removes the Chess contact lenses. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (stunned)
                    No...no...

                                  PETER FLEMING
                    Chess must pay for his crimes.

      Peter Fleming hands the Chess mask to Marty and a Lynx thug. 
      They smear glue all through the fabric.                                                                                    19.


                                  PETER FLEMING (CONT'D)
                    Lynx will make him pay. And when 
                    they do, the Mayor will turn over 
                    the police to me.
                          (beat)
                    And when the Coroner s report is

                    This is check, Vince.

      Peter Fleming nods. Marty and the Lynx thugs hold Vince--

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    No! No! 

    The Chess mask is forced over Vince s head and face.

                                  PETER FLEMING
                    You have one move left.

      EXT. FREIGHT YARD - PALM CITY - DAY

      A blood dawn looms on the horizon as VINCE FARADAY runs for 
    his life, staggering through the rail yard, YANKING on the 
      Chess mask glued to his face as...

      ...LYNX TROOPS methodically sweep across the rail yard. Red 
      targeting lasers dance across the freight cars.

      A LYNX CHOPPER swerves overhead, its hot spotlight on Vince 
    as he darts in and out.

      INT. KITCHEN - FARADAY HOME - DAY

      Coffee brews. Dana fixes TRIP his breakfast. The TV is on

    the steel casing of the freight cars. Vince ducks and runs. 
    He sees Lynx BOOTS underneath the freight cars. The chopper 
      spotlight follows him relentlessly.

      INT. KITCHEN - FARADAY HOME - DAY

      DANA continues with TRIP s breakfast, glancing at the TV. 
      Trip watches - fascinated.

                                  DANA
                    Why don t we turn that off? 

                                  TRIP
                    No!

                                  DANA
                    Honey, they sometimes have to shoot 
                    the person, I don t want--

                                  REPORTER (V.O.)
                    ...okay, there is new information--
                      we re--News 7 has learned -- we re 
                    being told the suspect is Police 
                    Sergeant - former Police Sergeant -
                    Vince Faraday.

                                  TRIP
                          (confused)
                    Why did she say that?

                                  DANA
                          (fixing Trip s plate)
                    What, hon?

                                  TRIP
                    They said Dad was Chess.

                                  DANA
                          (looks over)
                    They said what?                                                                                    22.


                                  TRIP
                            (frightened)
                    She said Dad.

      Dana turns up the TV.

                                  DANA 
                    That was a mistake. You didn t hear 
                    it, right. 

      With shaking hands, Dana fumbles for the phone, dialing 
      Vince s cellphone.

                                  TRIP
                    Mom, what--?

                                  DANA 
                    Quiet Trip!

      Suddenly, a black and white PHOTOGRAPH OF VINCE flashes on 
    the screen with the chyron: CHESS SUSPECT.

      Dana drops the phone. Hands over her mouth. Pure horror.

                                  TRIP
                          (in tears)
                    Why are they saying that?! Mom?!

                                  DANA
                          (whispers)
                    It s a mistake, it s a mistake--

                                  TRIP 
                          (looks at TV)
                    Are they gonnakill him?

      Dana takes hold of Trip in a primal embrace, terror-filled 
      eyes locked on the screen.

                                  DANA
                          (tries to cover Trip s 
                          eyes)
                    Don t watch. Don t watch. It s a 
                    mistake! They just got it wrong!

                                  TRIP
                          (crying)
                    Why are they chasing him!?

      EXT. RAIL YARD - PALM CITY - DAY 

      VINCE staggers past the strange Carnival poster and catches 
    his foot on a broken timber. Vince hits the ground hard. He 
      climbs to his feet, turns and sees...                                                                                    23.


      ...LYNX TROOPS curl around the corner, rifles aiming.

      Vince turns and sees a FUEL CAR blocking his path. Vince 
      charges towards the fuel car as bullets PWINGall around him. 
      Vince hits the dirt and scrambles on his stomach under the 
      fuel car. Vince claws for daylight. 

      Vince knows what happens next. He digs in the gravel. Drags 
      himself to his feet on the other side. But too late as...

      ...THE FUEL CAR EXPLODES.

      A shockwavehits Vince, throwing him forward like a rag doll, 
      followed by a gathering wave of blue fire that soars 
      overhead.

    The chopper PEELS away as the RAIL CAR hurtles into the sky 
    on a plume of hellflamebefore PLUMMETING back to Earth.

      LYNX TROOPS are flattened by the blast, retreating in a panic 
      from the licking, devouring fire.

      INT. KITCHEN - FARADAY HOME - DAY

      DANA screams and holds TRIP to her chest as the TV screen 
      fills with images of the explosion - their lives - in an 
      instant - turned inside out.

      EXT. RAIL YARD - PALM CITY - DAY

    The rail yard is filled with choking black smoke. Debris is 
      everywhere. VINCE S body smokes. His clothing is charred. He 
    is unconscious, face-down. He is oblivious to...

      ...a set of small, gnarled hands that take his collar and 
      roughly DRAG him into the shadows.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:

      EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - PALM CITY - DAY

      PETER FLEMING stands before a flotilla of cameras. A CROWD 
      fills the street. Peter Fleming is flanked by a LINEUP OF 
      LYNX TROOPS in their black gear.

                                  PETER FLEMING
                    Six months ago, when Mayor Welkins 
                    approached me about taking over the 
                    Palm City police force I told him 
                     no.  I told him Lynx - having 
                    proved itself in international 
                    conflicts the world over - hadn t 
                    proven itself on this battlefield. 
                    Today...we have.                                                                                     24.


      There is APPLAUSE. Cameras CLICK. 

                                  PETER FLEMING (CONT'D)
                    Palm City is safer this morning 
                    because of us. 
                          (beat)
                    And so it is - with pride - that I 
                    accept Mayor Welkins offer to be 
                    the first fully private 
                    metropolitan police force in the 
                    United States!

      More APPLAUSE.

      INT. KITCHEN - FARADAY HOME - DAY

      PETER FLEMING smiles for the cameras. Waves.

                                  REPORTER (V.O.)
                    In related news Lynx stock rose to 
                      40-dollars-a-share--

      Click. Screen goes black. A gaunt, exhausted DANA takes her 
      coffee and trudges up the stairs.

      INT. TRIP S ROOM - DAY

      DANA knocks softly.

                                  DANA
                          (whispers)
                    Trip, honey?

      TRIP lays in bed. Reading his CAPE COMIC. 

                                  DANA (CONT'D)
                          (whispers)
                    Sweetie, you want breakfast?

      Trip doesn t respond. Just reads his comic.

                                  DANA (CONT'D)
                    Take all the time you need. Will 
                    you eat a little something for 
                    Mommy later?

      Trip nods a little.

                                  DANA (CONT'D)
                          (smiles, thankful for any 
                            response)
                    Okay, hon.I love you.                                                                                    25.


      Dana shuts the door. Then...she loses it. She GASPS into her 
      hand and SOBS. Doesn t want Trip to hear. She heads for the 
      stairs. Coming apart at the seams.

      There is a KNOCK at the door.

      Dana recovers. Wipes her eyes. Heads downstairs. She opens 
    the door. It s MARTY VOYT. Pale. Ashen.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                          (tears in his eyes)
                    Dana...

      Seeing any kind of friendly face, Dana crumbles into his 
      arms. 

                                  MARTY VOYT (CONT'D)
                          (holds her)
                    I wish I knew what to say. I don t 
                    know what to say. I m so sorry. 
                          (beat)
                    This is a nightmare.

      Marty looks up...

      ...and sees TRIP staring down at him from the top of the 
      stairs. Marty tries to convey sympathy to Trip but there s 
      something about the boy s eyes that for a moment - shake 
      Marty. Marty s eyes show just a trace of menace.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. UNDERGROUND HIDEOUT - NIGHT

      Total blackness. WE HEAR rustling. Murmurs. Then...

                                  VOICE
                          (gravelly)
                    Wake him up.

      POW! Vince s eyes blink open. The first thing he sees is a 
      MUSCULAR LITTLE PERSON - about three feet tall - in a wife-
      beater-t-shirt, standing on a chair, reaching back with a 
      balled fist ready to BELT Vince again.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    M awake.
                          (clears his throat)
                    I m awake.

                                  MAX MALINI (O.S.)
                    Rollo.                                                                                    26.


    The little person - ROLLO - climbs down from the chair, 
      glares at Vince.

      Vince takes in the EXOTIC CREW before him. There are POSTERS 
    and dusty FRAMED PHOTOS of their traveling circus personas. 
      Rollo - the Little Person Strongman/Clown in his white makeup 
      alongside an East Indian in a shiny blue turban. The Animal 
      Trainer - RAIA - in her garish leather costume. Vince fits 
      right in with the Chess mask still half-glued to his face. 

    In their civilian clothes, the Carnival still strikes a 
      fairly odd note. 

    The leader of this group is showman/magician/escape-artist 
      (once extraordinaire) MAX MALINI (60s). Max has a faded-Errol-
      Flynn-feel about him. He taps pills into his hand and washes 
      them down with a swig of red wine. 

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                          (to Vince)
                    211. On the nose. Am I right?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (groggy)
                    Where am I?

      Rollo SMACKS Vince.

                                  ROLLO
                    Answer him, jerkface.He s guessing 
                    your weight. Two-eleven! Is he 
                    right?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (confused)
                    That sounds...yeah. About right.

      There is scattered applause. 

                                  RAIA
                          (to Vince)
                    He s never wrong.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    I never miss.
                          (beat)
                    So you re Chess, eh?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I m not Chess--

    The group LAUGHS.                                                                                    27.


                                  MAX MALINI
                    Is there egg on my face? Whatever 
                    gave me that impression?

      Rollo POPS on the TV across the room. There is wall-to-wall-
      coverage...

                                  REPORTER (V.O.)
                      ...authoritiescontinue to gather 
                    evidence after the explosion that 
                    appears to have taken the life of 
                    Vince Faraday, aka: Chess...

    We see VINCE S PHOTO alongside of police sketches of Chess. 
    TV pops off.

                                  MAX MALINI 
                          (turns back)
                    Whoops!

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I was framed...I was...
                          (beat)
                    Look, you want the truth? Chess is 
                    Peter Fleming.

      There is LAUGHTER. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                    He is!
                          (beat)
                    Fine. Whatever. What do you want? 

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Money, you poor, slow-thinking man! 
                    We are the Carnival of Crime! We 
                    are professional bank robbers! Now 
                    are you worth anything to me or 
                    not? Because I m getting thirsty!

      Rollo pours Max another cup of wine. Max drinks. Scowls.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I m just a cop.

      There is a GROAN from the gang.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Wrong answer! Rollo!

      Rollo drops the barbells, climbs up onto the chair and BELTS 
      Vince again.                                                                                    28.


                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    We hate cops! They arrest people 
                    like us!

                                  RAIA
                    Max, you re screaming.

                                  MAX MALINI
                          (to Raia)
                    I m using my stage voice!
                          (toVince, quieter)
                    When you were Chess you were 
                    interesting. Now you re boring.
                          (toRuvi, Rollo)
                    Dump him in the desert. Cut the 
                    fingers off. Head too, I guess.

                                  RAIA
                    But he s cute.

    The Carnival takes this in stride. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY

      RAIA sidles closer to Vince, nuzzling her RACCOON. 

    Max points his gold-tipped-cane at Vince. Nods approvingly.

      MARTY VOYT stands behind Fleming with SEVERAL SECURITY TECHS.
      Fleming is not pleased. He freezes the image of the raccoon.

      INT. STORAGE TENT - NIGHT

      VINCE is alone in a vast shadowy space. Dust swirls in the 
      moonlight that invades through the patchwork circus tent. 
      Vince sweats. He s taped chair legs - substitute truncheons - 
    to his forearms and assails one of the thick tent posts with 
      fast and hard BLOWS. It creates a RAT-A-TAT-TAT sound that 
      echoes through the space. Again. RAT-A-TAT-TAT. Again until 
    one of the chair legs BREAKS IN TWO.

      Vince tears it off his arm, frustrated. He turns to the rest 
    of the storage area. The walls are covered in old costumes, 
      handcuffs, broken magic cabinets, pieces of water tanks, 
      horse whips, clown toys and...

      ...Vince stops at Max s locker. Hanging from a nail is a 
      simple BLACK CAPE. Vince takes the cape off the nail sending 
      glistening dust into the air as it unfurls. Vince holds the

      Vince lays in bed with his son...

      FLASH ON:

      Vince stares intently at the black cape in his hands...

      FLASH ON:

      Vince pulls out the wrinkled comic book as Trip snuggles into 
    his father s arms...

      FLASH ON:

      Vince wraps an end of the black cape in each fist...something 
      dawning in his eyes...

      FLASH ON:

      Trip s eyes light up as Vince turns the page of the comic to 
      a full-page-spread of the superhero THE CAPEleaping across a 
      nighttime city-scape...                                                                                    36.


      FLASH ON:

      VINCE ducks down and SWIRLS the black cape over his head. 
      Pivots and crouches concealing himself in the cape...an 
      insane idea forming...Vince SLAMS the tent post with the 
      unbroken chair leg on his arm and WHIRLS around into a 
      crouch, the cape concealing all of Vince s face but his 
      burning eyes as we...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MAX S TRAILER - NIGHT

    WE PAN ACROSS a wall of framed photos and posters advertising 
       Max Malini s terrifying escapes and acts of stupendous 
      survival.  VINCE sits across from MAX. Max holds the old cape 
    in his hands.

                                  MAX MALINI 
                    Haven t seen this old rag in years.
                          (considerswhat Vince has 
                          asked him)
                    That would be...quite an act.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Is it possible?

    Max stands up with the cape.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    I ve broken ninety-two bones in 
                    pursuit of the perfect illusion. 
                    Trained generations of escapists, 
                    acrobats and magicians. I 
                    specialize in impossible.

    Max SNAPS out the Cape and it WRAPS around a glass on another 
      table and WHIPS back. Max catches the glass.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    But I do nothing halfway. It s all 
                    or nothing. You ll feel pain you ve 
                    never felt. I ll work you to the 
                    bone and beyond. You give me your 
                    soul...
                          (beat)
                    ...and I ll make you the greatest 
                    circus act that ever lived.

      With that, Max throws the cape around his body. There is an 
      EXPLOSION OF SMOKE and Max seemingly vanishes into thin air.                                                                                    37.

                    When do we start?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BOXING RING - DAY

    THE CREW hoots and hollers as VINCE squares off against ROLLO 
    in a boxing ring.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (trash talking Rollo)
                    Let s see how tough you are when 
                    I m not tied to a chair, huh?

                                  ROLLO
                    Bring it, bitch boy.

      Vince lunges for Rollo who somersaults through Vince s legs, 
      whirls around and takes Vince down with an ankle-drag. He 
      WRENCHES Vince s ankle in a vice-like-grip. Vince writhes on 
    the ground.

                                  ROLLO (CONT'D)
                    Tap out! Tap out, bitch!

      Vince TAPS...

      MOMENTS LATER...

      Vince and Rollo rush at each other. Vince KICKS at Rollo who 
      CATCHES Vince s leg, SWEEPS the other leg and DROPS a nasty 
      elbow right onto Vince s balls.

      Vince curls up like a dead spider. The Crew GROANS in 
      sympathy. Rollo raises his arms - victorious. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. RUVI S TRAILER - DAY

      RUVI - the cranky East Indian Mentalist - sits across from 
      VINCE at a table. Ruvi fiddles with a toothpick on the table 
    as he imparts his wisdom to Vince.

                                  RUVI
                    In Mentalism, the point is to not 
                    let the sucker know he s getting 
                      hypnotized, right? You talk about 
                    the weather,  oh my wife give me 
                    hard time,  you move his eye...

      Vince glances at the toothpick and back at Ruvi.                                                                                    38.


                                  RUVI (CONT'D)
                    ...but slowly you working your way 
                    into his mind...into his very 
                      soul...it s in the way you 
                    talk...the tone of your 
                    voice...your hands and how they 
                    move...
                          (breathes)
                    Your breathing. Lulling the dumb 
                    bastard into a state of 
                        utmost...suggestibility...

      Vince s lids flutter as Ruvi SLAMS the table. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (jolts)
                    What was that?

                                  RUVI
                    I just hypnotize you, sucker.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Yeah, right.

                                  RUVI
                    Then why you wearin girlie
                    panties, Vince?

      Vince stares at Ruvi for a beat. Then, slowly, Vince s eyes 
      look down at his jeans. Vince looks back at Ruvi - deeply 
      suspicious. Then Vince unbuttons his jeans and peeks and...

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to Ruvi)
                    That is not cool, Ruvi!

      Ruvi CACKLES with glee. Vince stands up, re-buttoning his 
      jeans, freaked completely.

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                    Not cool!

                                  RUVI
                    Gimmea hundred bucks and I won t 
                    tell the rest of the crew!

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. TRAPEZE - GYM - DAY

      VINCE stares down from the trapeze platform 100-feetto the 
      hard ground. POPO THE ACROBAT - a compact Korean man - stands 
      next to him.                                                                                    39.


                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to Popo)
                    Where s the net?

                                  POPO
                    Nets are for girls. No net make you 
                    think harder.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    You people are insane.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MAX S TRAILER - DAY

      VINCE sweats. He TWIRLS the cape. MAX shouts commands.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Spin! Spin! Spin! And snap it!

      Vince FLINGS the cape which SNAPS OUT and SNATCHES an empty 
      glass from the top of a stool and WINGS back at Vince s hand. 
      Vince almost catches the glass. Vince looks up at Max.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    Again.

      INT. MAX S TRAILER - DAY

    MAX holds a small capsule up to VINCE s eye. Max throws the 
      capsule on the ground. There is a BURST OF SMOKE.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. VINCE S TRAILER - NIGHT

      VINCE works on a dented laptop. He scrolls through 
      information on UNCONVENTIONAL and ASSYMETRICALWAREARE.

      There are files on DEMOLITIONS and CONCEALMENT, PSYCHOLOGICAL 
      WARFARE. Vince writes in a notebook...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. TRAPEZE - GYM - DAY

      VINCE tips forward and FREE-FALLS from the trapeze platform - 
      swan-diving - until CAPTURING the swing as it comes at him. 
      Vince goes up and up and...

        ...BACKFLIPSthrough the air CATCHING the other swing. All 
      without a net.                                                                                    40.


      Vince lands safely on the other platform. POPO gives him a 
      thumb s up.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. RUVI S TRAILER - DAY

      RUVI and VINCE sit across from each other. Ruvi s eyes drift 
    for a second as Vince SLAMS the table.

                                  RUVI
                          (recovers)
                    You wish, sucker.

      Vince pulls on his shirt collar. Smiles.

      Ruvi feels his shirt collar. Looks down at his shirt buttons. 
      Unbuttons his shirt. Opens his shirt TO REVEAL...

      ...A BRA. Double D.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Gimmea hundred bucks and I don t 
                    tell the crew.

      Ruvi LAUGHS. Vince LAUGHS as Ruvi reaches across the table 
    and PUNCHES Vince off his chair.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BOXING RING - DAY

      Back in the boxing ring. VINCE has a bloody nose. ROLLO s got 
      a cut under his eye. They circle each other.

      Rollo lunges but Vince drops to his stomach, catches Rollo by 
    the waist in a SCISSORS-CLUTCH. Rollo squirms. Escapes. Dives 
    at Vince who break-dance-pivots and RE-CAPTURES Rollo by the 
      leg. YANKS on the ankle. TWISTS.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Now youtap!

      Rollo fights and fights but finally relents TAPPING OUT to 
    the crew s CHEERS. Vince falls back, exhausted.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. VINCE S TRAILER - NIGHT

      VINCE studies a FLOW CHART that he has constructed on his 
      wall with PETER FLEMING at the top of it.                                                                                     41.


      LYNX CORPORATION and CHESS occupy the spaces beneath Peter 
      Fleming representing his criminal and corporate empires. 
      Vince searches for weaknesses.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MAX S TRAILER - DAY

      VINCE wields the cape like it s a living thing, a whip-like-
      shadow, SNAPPING across the room. 

    MAX watches, following each move. Focused. 

      Vince SNUFFS a candle flame with the cape which STREAKS back 
    and RIPS a knife from the hand of a mannequin and FLINGS the 
      knife into a BULLSEYETARGET across the trailer before... 

      ...wrapping up Vince like a corpse. There is an EXPLOSION OF 
      SMOKE and...

      ...Vince is gone. The cape drops harmlessly to the floor. Max 
      sits back on the table. Impressed.

                                  MAX MALINI
                          (to the air)

    The men LAUGHS. 

      EXT. ALLEY - IN THE BACK OF CLUB TATOU - NIGHT

    THE LYNX TROOPS push the girls into the alley.

                          (beat)
                    I m going back inside.

    One of the drunk troops shoves Club Girl #1 too hard and she 
      face-plants across the cement.

                                  CLUB GIRL #1 (CONT'D)
                          (digs in her purse)
                    I m calling a cop--

    Her hand is YANKED AWAY. The Lynx Trooper gets in her face. 
      Flashes a LYNX BADGE.                                                                                    43.

                    Come on, guys, it s cool--

      Trooper #2 hauls off and WHACKS Club Girl #2 into a row of 
      trash cans. Trooper #2 pulls a GUN.

                    Time to play Simon Sez.

    The Trooper chambers a round as...

      ...a LIVING SHADOW snaps out of the darkness, SNATCHES the 
    gun from the Trooper s hand and FLINGS it 50-feet-away.

                                  LYNX TROOP #2 (CONT'D)

    The fire escape SHUDDERS as SOMETHING blurs by at the two-
      story-level when there is a BURST OF SMOKE and...

      ...another BURST OF SMOKE in the alley. The smoke clears away 
      from a TALL FIGURE completely hidden by a LONG COWL or CAPE.

                                  LYNX TROOP #1

      Lynx Trooper #2 looks around - frantic as...

      ...VINCE FARADAY rises up behind him wearing a thin black 
      mask and black body armor. When he looks like this...

      ...we ll call him THE CAPE.

    The Lynx Trooper WHIRLS around.

    The Cape ducks a punch and drops to the ground, viciously LEG-
      SWEEPS the Lynx Trooper, then TWISTS and PIVOTS around his 
      body RAINING DOWN BLOWS on the overmatched Trooper.                                                                                    44.


      Lynx Trooper #1 aims and FIRES but The Cape SPRINGS up the

      ...at his cape which he WHIPS into the air and it SNAPS out, 
      WRAPS around the Trooper s wrist and YANKS him forward where 
    he meets...

      EXT. TOP LYNX HEADQUARTERS SKYSCRAPER - NIGHT

    THE LYNX TROOPER S eyes flutter open. It s windy. He looks 
      around at the glowing cityscapeof Palm City. Looks down and 
      sees that he is harnessed to a bungee cord.

                                  LYNX TROOP #1
                    Whoa! What s--what sthis!?

    The Trooper looks around and sees THE CAPE testing the 
      strength of a piton. The Cape then writes something on a 
      piece of paper. He comes at The Trooper.

                      P-please!What do you want?

    The Cape pins something on the Trooper s chest. The Cape digs 
    in the Trooper s pockets and pulls out a...

      ...a slip of paper. A SCHEDULE OF A SHIPMENT from the Palm 
      City Piers. Someone has written 2PMon it. He pockets it.

                                  THE CAPE

                    What? What message?! What reyou--

    The Cape THUDS his boot into the Trooper s chest. The Trooper 
      SCREAMS bloody murder as he TOPPLES backwards, off the roof 
    and PLUNGES twenty stories, bungee cord trailing until...

      INT. OFFICE OF PETER FLEMING - LYNX HQ - NIGHT

      PETER FLEMING types at his computer as...

      ...THE TROOPER explodes through his floor-to-ceiling plate 
      glass window. Fleming dives to the ground as shattered glass 
      sprays everywhere. The Trooper FLOPS onto the ground.

      Fleming crawls over to the Trooper s body. Finds the note.                                                                                     45.


    It reads:  Endgame. Where the pawn becomes King. I know what

    The tourists move on. Raia turns to the Raccoon who hands 
      Raia the Tourist s wallet. She checks it. Full of cash.

      INT. LIMOUSINE - PALM CITY - DAY

      RAIA is forced into the back of a limousine by LYNX COPS.

                          Chess)
                    Thought you were dead.

      Marty and the Lynx Guard look at each other nervously. 
      Obviously this wasn t part of their plans either.

    The usually tough Raia pales. She believes him.

      EXT. PALM CITY PIERS - DAY 

      A TRUCK pulls up to a SECURITY POST at the Palm City piers. 
      Huge tankers and towers of shipping containers form the 
      backdrop.

    The truck window lowers. THE SECURITY GUARD drops his ring of 
      keys as a...

      ...strangely glittering, scaled HAND reaches out of the truck 
      clutching a wad of hundreds.The Security Guard takes the 
      money, finding it hard to look at the person in the truck.

      REVERSE ON: The face behind the window. He s big. Massive 
      even. He has a freakish skin condition that gives him the 
      appearance of green and gold scales. And he wears RayBans.
      This is DOMINIC RAOUL aka: GATOR. He s human. Just barely.

                                  GATOR
                    What s shaking, baby?

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Container Twelve.

    The Security Guard pushes the button lifting the arm. The 
      truck drives onto the piers.

      EXT. CONTAINER TWELVE - PALM CITY PIERS - DAY

      GATOR tears open a box marked: BABY TOYS. He digs out a TOY 
      BEAR and rips off the head. Checks to see if the NERVE AGENT 
      cannister is inside. Bingo.

                                  GATOR
                    Move, slugs! On the truck!

      Gator s men haul the crates on hand trucks towards the back 
    of the truck. A SCARED THUG stands next to Gator.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                    I don t want to name names to 
                    Chess. Yeah. You re moving now.

      Gator s phone rings.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (answers)

                    My therapist. My old lady s got me 
                    seeing one.                                                                                     49.


    The Scared Thug nods, wishing he were somewhere else.

      Something black DARTS out from behind a tower of crates, 
      COILS around a thug s neck and JERKS him behind a crate. 
      There is a CRASH and a CHOKED CRY.

      Everyone looks around. Gator frowns. Draws a massive GUN. 

      There is a SNAP and ANOTHER THUG goes HURTLING into the 
      water. And another YANKS backwards out of frame and WHAMS
      into the shipping container.

      Gator aims for the shadows as...

      ...a cape SNAPS around his wrist. But Gator SNARLS and RIPS 
    his arm forward...

        ...somersaulting THE CAPE into the light. The Cape recovers 
    and delivers several FIERCE BLOWS to Gator s ribs.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (grins)

                                  THE CAPE 
                    Thanks.

      Gator grabs the Cape by the throat and literally THROWS him 
      20-feet.The Cape SLAMS off one of the containers. Before The 
      Cape can catch his breath...

      ...Gator is on top of him. BITES his shoulder. Lifts him up - 
      over his head like an Olympic lifter - and brings him down 
      HARD over his knee. We might hear a rib CRACK.

    The Cape rolls over in agony. THUGS watch as Gator RIPS part 
    of a chain barrier and a pylon from the ground.

                                  GATOR
                          (to his boys)
                    Pay attention, slugs!

      Gator wraps the chain around the Cape s neck. Knots the chain 
      around his arms. The Cape STRUGGLES.

      Gator hefts the pylon (has to be 300-pounds) which drags the 
      chain...which drags the Cape to the water s edge.

    His phone RINGS.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (answers, listens)

      Gator holds the phone up the The Cape s GAGGING.

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    That s how I roll, Dennis!

      Gator hangs up, heaves the pylon over the edge...

      ...DRAGGING the Cape across the concrete and WHIPPING him 
      over the side. The Cape plummets 30-feetinto the water and 
      vanishes. Even Gator s thugs are freaked out by his ferocity. 

                                  GATOR (CONT'D)
                          (to thugs)
                    Fish  em out tonight. The Lich ll
                    want to see that.

      INT. UNDERWATER - DAY

    THE CAPE kicks and panics as the pylon ROCKETS to the bottom 
    and lands with an audible THUD. The Cape writhes and swallows 
      water. WE HEAR his heartbeat HAMMERING.

    WE FLASH on STUTTERING IMAGES of MAX MALINI...RUVI THE 
        MENTALIST...Vince doing meditations...

    WE FLASH on The Cape slowing down, relaxing his body. WE HEAR 
    his heartbeat SLOWING.

    WE FLASH on MAX vanishing in a burst of smoke...Ruvi SLAMS 
    the table...WE HEAR voices...commands...

    WE FLASH on The Cape. He is utterly still. His body rests, 
      corpse-like, on the bottom. His heartbeat slows to a stop. 

    The images fade. Voices fade. The Cape is completely still. 

        Until...WHAM.The Cape JERKS his body - dislocating his own 
      shoulder. The extra slack allows him to work free of the 
      chains. Bubbles pour forth from his mouth as he slides the 
      chains off like a snakeskin and claws for the surface...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY PIERS - NIGHT

      A LYNX TROOPER walks the pier as lights glow from the 
      warehouse windows. We hear MACHINERY running inside.

      Suddenly, the Lynx Trooper HITS the ground hard and DRAGS 
      over the side. We hear a SPLASH.                                                                                    51.


      EXT. ROOF - WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY - NIGHT

    THE CAPE climbs onto the roof and runs to a row of skylights. 
    He peers inside and sees GATOR running things. FORKLIFTS move 
    the boxes we saw earlier. The Cape sees the material is being 
      moves into new boxes labeled for VENEZUELA. Then...

      ...The Cape hears a shutter CLICK. He whips around and sees 
      nothing but hears FOOTSTEPS. 

      From the ledge, the Cape spots a FIGURE running away. The 
      Cape DIVES to the other rooftop, lands in a roll, gets up on 
    his feet, racing after the figure. He springs off the roof, 
      uses the fire escape as a springboard and FLIPS onto the 
      ground where he DROPS the figure with a SPINNING KICK.

      Vince tears off the figure s backpack, spilling notebooks 
      that bear the ORWELL INSIGNIA.

                          (hesitates)
                    Are you--?

    The Cape catches a SWINGING PUNCH. He twists Orwell s arm but 
      doesn t see the tazer that ZAPS him. The Cape snatches it.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    Not cool!

      Orwell s ponytail shakes free in the struggle. She s 23 and 
      really cute in an intrepid, violent sort of way.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    You re Orwell? What reyou twelve?

                                  ORWELL
                    You re the one wearing long 
                    underwear and a cape.

                                  THE CAPE
                          (thinks about this)
                    Fair enough.

      TITLE: ORWELL

      INT. MAX S TRAILER - NIGHT

    MAX MALINI secures a few bricks of cash in his safe. A 
      distant train WHISTLES. Then...a KNOCK on his door.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    This is my private drinking time! 
                    This better be...

    Max opens the door for FOUR LYNX TROOPS. 

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                      Gentlemen...join me for a drink, 
                    won t you?

    Out of sight of the Lynx Troops, Max PULLS on a hidden cord 
    in an old clock beside the door that...

      INT. CARNIVAL HIDEOUT - UNDER THE FREIGHT YARD - NIGHT

      ...reaches underground, through a system of pipes and into 
    the Carnival s secret tunnels. ROLLO and RUVI look up at the 
      RINGING BELL - an alarm.

                                  ROLLO
                    They got Max.

      INT. MAX S TRAILER - NIGHT

      A TROOPER shoves MAX hard against the wall and BELTS him. 
      He s taken roughly by the arms and led out of the trailer.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. ORWELL S WHEELS - PALM CITY - NIGHT

    THE CAPE is in the passenger seat of ORWELL s hot, black, 
      sports car loaded with open laptops.On one screen NUMBERS 
      scroll and scroll.

                                  THE CAPE
                            (recognizes)
                    Are those credit card numbers?

      Tires SCREECH as Orwell turns sharply into an underground 
      parking lot. The Cape hangs on tight - a little worried - as 
      Orwell speeds up taking turn after turn finally SQUEALING to 
      a stop inside a WIDE FREIGHT ELEVATOR.                                                                                     53.

                    Take off your glove and flip the 
                    button for your window.

      Vince takes off his glove. Flips the button for the window. 
    But instead of the window moving - BEHIND THEM - the doors 
      seal shut and the elevator LIFTS.

                                  THE CAPE 
                          (approves)
                    That was cool.

      When the doors - re-open. Orwell throws the car in REVERSE 
    and peels out into a completely bare, top-floor, floor-wide 
      penthouse view space above Palm City. Orwell stops.

                                  ORWELL
                    Get out.

      INT. ORWELL S PENTHOUSE LAIR - PALM CITY - NIGHT

      Vast. Barebones.Lots of laptops.Lots of wires. Cold. 
      Beautiful. ORWELL walks over to check on of her screens.

                          (looks around)
                    Some poor bastard has some credit 
                    card bill.

                    Who do you work for?

                                  THE CAPE
                    I don t work for anyone.

                                  ORWELL
                    Oh, please. You re just another 
                    mindgameto squirm out of Peter 
                    Fleming s twisted brain. 

                                  THE CAPE
                    What are you doing?

                                  ORWELL
                    Running the fingerprints you gave 
                    me when you pushed for the elevator 
                    door in the car. I ll find you.

                                  THE CAPE
                          (thrown, angered)
                    Hey, wait a minute--                                                                                    54.


    On Orwell s laptop we suddenly see VINCE S POLICE ID PHOTO. 
      It s Orwell s turn to be stunned. 

                                  ORWELL
                    Vince Faraday?

    The Cape sweeps across the room and SWATS Orwell s computer 
      onto the floor where it SHATTERS.

                                  THE CAPE
                          (serious)
                    Vince Faraday is dead.

                            collar)

                    my family in danger, I swear to God 
                    you won t need that freight 
                    elevator to reach the street. 

                                  ORWELL
                    We re on the same side, Vince--

                                  THE CAPE
                    How many cops did you rat out? I 
                    lost count!

                                  ORWELL
                    Dirty cops.

                                  THE CAPE
                    Well, I wasn t! And you ruined my 
                    life!

    The Cape shoves her to the ground. Orwell climbs to her feet.

                                  ORWELL
                    I though you might like to know who 
                    you were working for.

                                  THE CAPE 
                    I found out, all right.

                                  ORWELL
                          (amazed)
                    So this...thisis real. You re 
                    fighting back.

                                  THE CAPE 
                    Do I have a choice?

                                  ORWELL
                          (pause)
                    Why the get-up?                                                                                    55.

                    I have my reasons.
                          (beat)
                    This is an unconventional war.

                                  ORWELL
                    I want to help you, Vince--

                                  THE CAPE
                    I m the Cape.

                                  ORWELL

                    the inside, you know the players in

      INT. A BASEMENT - SOMEWHERE AWFUL - NIGHT

    MAX MALINI squints from the bright lights in his eyes. He s 
      tied to a chair surrounded by LYNX GOONS lingering in the 
      shadows. He hears a door open. Hears footsteps as...

      ...CHESS steps into the light. Sits in front of Max.

                                  CHESS

                    Ours is a road show. Town-to-town 
                    type of deal. Never give the angle, 
                    see? Company policy.

                                  CHESS
                    This is my company policy.                                                                                    56.


      A Goon PINS Max s arm to the arm of the chair. Chess reveals 
      a BRICK in his hand. He SLAMS it down on Max s hand.

                    Then you two have a lot of catching 
                    up to do.

    The Goons grab hold of Max. He struggles as we...

      TITLE: THE CAPE VS.CHESS - ROUND ONE

      INT. BASEMENT - SOMEWHERE AWFUL - DAY

    MAX MALINI S head droops over his shirt. Blood drips from his 
      lips. CHESS paces, frustrated, sleeves rolled up.

                                  CHESS
                    Don t die, Max. I need names.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Die?

    Max lifts his head with effort. His face is a mess. Brutal.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                          (smiles)
                    Just getting warmed up, sweetheart.

                          (to Marty Voyt)
                    Bring him in here.

      MARTY VOYT turns paler than usual and exits.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Peter! 

      Chess turns, livid.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    Didn t Mummy love you enough? What 
                    did she do to you that made you

                          (his cool falters)
                    Shut up!

    The door opens. The light frames a MASSIVE FORM as...

      ...GATOR enters. Takes off his sunglasses. 

                                  MAX MALINI 
                          (spots Gator)
                    Whatever he s paying you I ll 
                    double it. 

      Gator CHUCKLES. Cracks his knuckles.                                                                                    58.


                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    I mean it, son. You re playing for 
                    the wrong team. I ll make you a 
                    star.

                    Sweet.

      Gator approaches.

                          (disapproving)
                    Doesn t anyone value showmanship 
                    anymore?

    Max POPS his shoulder. His other arm WRIGGLES free. With 
      shocking speed, Max flings a chair at Gator s head, vaults 
    the table and DIVES through the door to the stairwell. 

      INT. WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY PIERS - DAY 

    MAX drags himself to his feet, limping terribly. 

      CHESS and GATOR surge up the stairs. Chess pulls a gun and 
      FIRES after the fleeing Max who...

      ...darts into a cityscapeof shipping crates.

                                  CHESS
                    Find him! He s one old man!

      INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE WAREHOUSE - DAY

    MAX hobbles along. His hand leaves a BLOOD IMPRINT on one of 
    the crates. He s been hit.

    He WHEEZES and staggers. Searching for escape with 
      increasingly blurry vision.

    He drops to a knee. Recovers. His eyes go to a HUGE WINDOW at 
    the end of the corridor. Max shuffles towards it as...

      ...TWO LYNX TROOPS step into his path holding rifles.

                                  LYNX TROOP #1
                    Abracadabra, Pops.

      A SHADOW rises in the window, behind the Lynx Troops...                                                                                    59.


                                  MAX MALINI
                          (sees the shadow, 
                            whispers)
                    Presto.

      ...asTHE CAPE explodes through the window and falls upon the 
      Lynx Troops like a bird of prey. There are STUTTERED GUNSHOTS 
      then silence as unconscious bodies hit the floor.

    Max BUCKLES into The Cape s arms.

                                  THE CAPE
                    Max! 

    The Cape sees the blood. Sees Max s beaten face.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    It s okay, don t try to talk.

                                  MAX MALINI
                          (through bloody lips)
                    I m the one dying here. I like to 
                    talk.

    The Cape eases Max to the floor.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)(beat)
                    At least you ve...gotten yourself 
                    an act. What you said about your 
                      boy...about showing him that one 
                    man can make a difference. That 
                    stayed with me.
                          (beat)
                    Just take this from a man who never 
                    knew his father and never had a 
                    son...that bond...it s what makes 
                    heroes...
                          (beat)
                    Don t make me a jerk. Get your boy 
                    back. 

                                  THE CAPE
                    I will, Max.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Want to say something 
                    profound...last words and all 
                      but...God...I really need a drink.

    Max stops. His eyes close. The Cape lays him down gently. 
      Puts a hand on Max s chest. Then...

      ...Max opens one eye.                                                                                    60.


                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    Damn it...I thought that was it.

                                  THE CAPE
                          (surprised, relieved)
                    Max?

                                  MAX MALINI
                    And I wasted that great speech.

      INT. NEWSROOM - NEWS 7 - DAY

      A bustling news room. THE LOCAL NEWS DIRECTOR takes a phone 
      from an INTERN.

                    This is Shwaid.

                    the Palm City Piers. Shots fired in 
                      a warehouse owned by Peter Fleming.

      EXT. PALM CITY PIERS - DAY

      ORWELL sits in her car. A voice-disguiser on her phone which 
    is plugged into her laptop. She watches LYNX TROOPS funneling 
      into the warehouse.

                                  ORWELL
                          (eyes on warehouse)

                    scene. This is your scoop. Try not 
                    to screw it up.

      Orwell hangs up.

      INT. WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY PIERS - DAY

      MARTY VOYT runs down the corridor of the warehouse.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                          (into radio)
                      Donnely?Where are you?!

      Suddenly, something BLACK shoots out of the darkness and 
      wraps around Marty s ankle, YANKING him off his feet. Marty 
      turns - terrified - to the DARK SHADOWS as he drags slowly 
      towards them...                                                                                    61.

                    a light at the end of the 
                      tunnel...they see darkness...they 
                    see me.

      Marty SCREAMS like a stuck pig as he VANISHES into the 
      shadows and we hear a few seriously PAINFUL BLOWS.

      INT. WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY PIERS - DAY

    TWO LYNX TROOPS enter a tunnel in the warehouse but don t see 
      POPO THE ACROBAT wedged in the ceiling above their heads. 
      Popo DROPS on top of them swinging a bo-stick.

      INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE WAREHOUSE - DAY

      A LYNX CAPTAIN jogs up to CHESS and A LYNX OFFICER.

                                  LYNX CAPTAIN
                          (to Chess)
                    Scanners picked up News Van 
                    chatter. Cameras are coming here. 
                    Now.

                                  CHESS
                          (to Officer)
                    Set charges. Light it up.

    The Officer runs off. The Captain s radio SQUAWKS.

                                  LYNX CAPTAIN
                          (to Chess)
                    Your chopper s on its way, sir. 
                    Roof s this way.

      Chess and the Lynx Captain head for the stairway.

      ACROSS THE WAREHOUSE:

      GATOR stalks the corridors. Hears SHOTS echo off the walls. 
      Gator turns the corner as...

      ...a thrown WRENCH smacks off his head. Gator stumbles back 
    as ROLLO somersaults into the corridor. Cracks his own neck.

                                  ROLLO
                    You like to party, bitch?

                                  GATOR
                    Looks like you need to cook a 
                    little longer.                                                                                    62.


      Rollo pulls a LEAD PIPE. He walks up and CRACKS Gator right 
    in the kneecap. Gator ROARS in pain as Rollo SPINS and POPS 
    the lead pipe off Gator s shin bone. Gator collapses onto his 
      hands and knees. Rollo hauls off and WHACKS Gator in the jaw 
      with the pipe. Sharp teeth go flying...

      ELSEWHERE IN THE WAREHOUSE:

      MARTY and his TROOPS set timers on EXPLOSIVES. Set them for 
    two minutes. The countdown begins...2:00...1:59...1:58...

      EXT. ROOF - WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY - DAY

      CHESS and the LYNX CAPTAIN run across the warehouse roof 
      where a CHOPPER hovers. A ladder is dropped. 

    The Lynx Captain grabs the rope ladder. Hauls himself up. 
      Throws out a hand for Chess who takes it. They climb the 
      ladder, dangling over the warehouse roof. 

    In the distance FIRE and POLICE sirens are seen and heard. 

                                  CHESS
                          (to Captain)
                    Hurry up!

      Chess looks up into the black visor and helmet of the Lynx 
      Captain.

                                  CHESS (CONT'D)
                    Pull me up!

    The Lynx Captain takes off his helmet TO REVEAL...

      ...THE CAPE.

      Chess s crazy eyes go wide. The two adversaries are frozen 
      there in space for a long moment. The chopper hovers.

                                  THE CAPE
                    Checkmate.

      Chess pulls a KNIFE from his pocket, tries to swing it 
      around, but the Cape sees it and simply OPENS HIS HAND...

      ...Chess PLUMMETS backward 20 feet to the warehouse roof. 

    The Cape RIPS OFF his gear and DIVES after him. His CAPE 
      UNFURLS allowing him to glide to the roof - landing surely on 
    his feet. Chess struggles to his feet, hurt but alive.                                                                                    63.


      INT. WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY PIERS - DAY

      ORWELL ducks bullets and races around towers of shipping 
      containers. She pulls up fast when she sees...

      ...the EXPLOSIVES. The countdown: 20...19...18...

                                  ORWELL
                          (into radio)
                    Cape, we have to clear out of here 
                    now! We ve got twenty seconds!

      EXT. ROOF - WAREHOUSE - PALM CITY - DAY

    THE CAPE and CHESS exchange blows on the warehouse roof. The 
      Cape lifts Chess s body into the air with brutal KICKS to the 
      ribs. He BACKHANDS Chess who topples onto the ground again.

    The chopper continues to HOVER overhead.

                                  ORWELL (V.O.)
                          (overradio)
                    Cape! Respond!

      A CONE OF FIRE rips a piece of the roof away. Glass SHATTERS. 
      Chess PUNCHES The Cape.

      Another EXPLOSION spews debris into the air. The Cape TACKLES 
      Chess. The chopper BUZZES overhead.

                                  CHESS
                    I ll find out who you are! I ll 
                    find out who you are and kill 
                    everything you love!

                                  THE CAPE
                          (takes Chess by the 
                            collar)
                    You can t touch me. I m already 
                    dead!

      Another ERUPTION disintegrates most of the roof. The Cape has 
    no choice, he backs away from Chess, throws his cloak around 
      himself and VANISHES in a burst of smoke. 

      WIDE AS: The warehouse PLUMES in a crescendo of flames. WE 
      SOAR UPWARDS and see...

      ...CHESS - his body smoking - clinging desperately to the 
      rope ladder of the chopper as it swerves away into the sky.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:                                                                                    64.


      INT. ORWELL S PENTHOUSE LAIR - PALM CITY - NIGHT

      ORWELL hovers over her many laptopsspeaking with VINCE on 
      speakerphone. 

                                  ORWELL
                    You did good out there, Vince.

                                  THE CAPE (O.S.)
                    You too, Orwell. But now you re the 
                    mystery. Who are you anyway?

      Orwell looks down at an OPEN DRAWER in her desk. There, 
      discarded like an ashtray, is a small framed photo of ORWELL, 
    in happier times, with her father: a smiling PETER FLEMING. 
      Orwell shuts the drawer.

                                  ORWELL
                    Nobody special.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. TRIP S ROOM - NIGHT

      It s 3am.The city sleeps. All is quiet in the Faraday 
      apartment. Dana and Trip have moved into an apartment 
      downtown.

      TRIP s eyes POP open at the sound of weight CREAKING on the 
      fire escape outside his window.

      Trip sits up. Looks out the window. Opens the window. Hears 
      FLAPPING and sees the wind rustling the pages of a new CAPE 
      comic book on the fire escape. 

      Trip smiles, reaches for it as...

                                  THE CAPE (O.S.)
                    Are you Trip Faraday?

      Trip WHIRLS around and looks up and sees...

      ...THE CAPE balanced on the railing of the fire escape, his 
      cloak billowing in the wind behind him.

      Trip - his mouth dry - can only nod.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    You read my comic?

      Trip nods.                                                                                    65.


                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    I knew your father. 
                          (pause)
                    He was a good cop. And he was 
                    framed for those crimes.

      Unbelievable relief washes over Trip.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    I know the guilty. And I won t stop 
                    until they know justice.
                          (pause)
                    Your father wanted me to give you a 
                    message. He said,  don t lose hope. 
                    Never lose hope.  He said  be good 
                    to your Mom and study your math. 
                    You need to work on the math. 

      Trip nods, sounds like his Dad all right.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D (CONT'D)
                    And tell him,  I love him more than 
                    anything. And someday...someday
                    we ll see each other again. 

    In the distance a police siren WAILS. Trip turns to look. He 
      turns back and...

      ...THE CAPE is gone. Trip goes to the edge of the railing. 
      Stares out into the night. Hope in his eyes as we...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:
