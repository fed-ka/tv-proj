As MARK busts out of the bar, past Bobby the door guy and into
the population of Harvard Square.
CUT TO:
As MARK continues on, he passes a group of people heading in
the opposite direction for a party.
As MARK's steady and determined stride continues, he'll. pass
by all kinds of (seemingly) happy, well-adjusted, socially
adept people.

2:55 AM
MARK makes a few last key strokes and a new website comes up
on the screen .
FACEMASH
MARK makes a few more keystrokes and two pictures of two
Harvard girls come up on the screen.
After a moment...
ALL
The one on the left.
MARK clicks the girl on the left and another picture takes the
place of the girl on the right.
ALL (CONT'D)
On the right.
MARY clicks the girl on the right while another picture takes
the place of the girl on the left.
ALL (CONT'D)
Still the right.
EDUARDO
It works.
DUSTIN
Who should we send it to first?
EDUARDO
Dwyer.
CHRIS
Neal.
EDUARDO
Who are you gonna send it to?
MARK's made the link to e-mail and hits send.
18,
MARK
Just a Couple of people. The question is,
who are they gonna send it to?
CUT TOT
The Harvard Crew is practicing on two-man sculls. There are
three boats that are running roughly even with each other and
the two-man crews are rowing with all they've got. We're
gliding along with them in the water--
CREW MEMBER
(SHOUTING)
Bring up the rate! 2 in 2! One..two--
25,
ANOTHER CREW MEMBER (DIFFERENT
BOAT)
Power 10 in 2! In 2!
A THIRD CREW MEMBER (DIFFERENT
BOAT)
They had open water after a hundred
meters. I don't think we're gonna catch
'em today.
And we PULL BACK TO REVEAL that there's a fourth boat which is
already five boat, ngths ahead of the other three.
3-1
The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER
WINKLEVOSS----identical twins who stepped out of an ad for
Abercrombie and Fitch.
They know that the others aren't in their class and even
though they're highly competitive athletes, they don't like
showing anyone up, least of all their teammates.
CAMERON
Is there anyway to make this a fair
fight?
TYLER
We could jump out and swim.
CAMERON
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.
TYLER
I'm not willing to do that.
CAMERON
What are we at three-quarter power? Let's
drop down to a half.
TYLER
Or you could row forward and I could row
backward.
CAMERON
I'd kick your ass.
TYLER
We're genetically identical, so biology
and mathematics says we'd stay in one
place not allowing for the current or the
wind.
CAMERON
Just row the boat.
26,
And the WINI{LEVOSS twins kick into full gear and open up an
even wider lead as we.
CUT. TO:
EDU.ARDO
It could have been worse.
MARK
No it couldn't. They made me apologize.
EDUARDO
To who?
MARK
To them. Over and over.
EDUARDO
It's alright.
MARK
No.
EDUARDO
It's okay. You're fine.
MARK
(PAUSE)
I shouldn't have said the thing about the
farm animals. That was stupid. Everybody's
mad at me now.
30,
EDUARDO
Maybe, but at least everybody knows you
now.

As MARK comes out and heads onto the quad--
CAMERON (OS)

Mark?
CAMERON and TYLER have been waiting by the entrance.
CAMERON (CONT'D)
Are you Mark?
MARK
Yeah.
CAMERON
I'm Cameron winklevoss.
MARK
TYLER
Tyler Winklevoss.
MARY
(BEAT)
Are you guys related?
CAMERON
Good.
TYLER
That's funny.
CAMERON
We've never heard that before.
MARK
Did I insult your girlfriends? What can I
do for you?
CAMERON
No, you didn't insult our girl--
(TO TYLER)
Actually, I don't know.
TYLER
(TO CAMERON)
We never asked.
CAMERON
We should do that.
32,
TYLER
Yeah.
CAMERON
No, we have an idea we want to talk to
you about. Do you have a minute?
MARK
(PAUSE)
You guys look like athletes.
CAMERON
We are.
MART
What do you do?
TYLER
We row crew.
MARK
(pause---then smiles a little)
Yeah, I've got a minute.
CUT TO:
MARK and EDUARDO come outside and are immediately met by the
freezing cold air.
MARK
People came to Facemash in a stampede,
right?
EDUARDO
Yeah.
MARK
It wasn't because I put up pictures of
hot girls. You can go anywhere on the
internet and see pictures of hot girls.
EDUARDO
Yeah.
MARK
It was because I put up pictures of girls
that people knew. So if people Want to go
on the internet and check out their
friends, why can't I build a website that
offers that? An online community of
friends. Pictures, profiles, whatever you
can click into, visit, browse around. All
from the privacy of your dorm room. I'm
not talking about a dating site. I'm
talking about taking the entire social
structure of college and putting it
online.
EDUARDO
I can't feel my legs.
MARK
I know, I'm totally pumped about this.
BUT WARDO--
CUT TO:
MARK
--it would be exclusive. You'd have to
know the people on the site to get in.
Like getting punched.
40,
EDUARDO
This is interesting.
MARK
Like our own Final club except not only
can we get into this one, we're the
president.
CUT TO:
MARK
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent'the servers and get it online.
CUT TO;
MARK
We'll split it 70-30. 70 for me and 30
for you for putting up a thousand dollars
and handling everything on the business
end. You'll be CFO.
CUT TO:
MARK
It probably was a. diversity thing but so
what?
CUT TO:
EDUARDO's walking away and calls back to MARK--
EDUARDO
(CALLING)
I'll let you know how the party is,
We stay on MARK for a moment longer, his wheels turning,
BEFORE WE
CUT TO:
The MUSIC CONTINUES--
It's snowing and cold as hell. EDUARDO's now with a smaller
group of prospective members, most of whom are in their
underwear with a couple of them wearing pants. They're all
blue and shivering. They're gathered around a statue of John
Harvard as a senior announces--
SENIOR
As the plaque reads, this is John
Harvard, founder of Harvard University in
1638. It's also called The Statue of
Three Lies. What are the three lies?
SOPHOMORE
(SHOUTING)
Sir!
SENIOR
Mr. Dowd,
SOPHOMORE
The three lies--
(BEAT)
THE FIRST--
(BEAT)
Shit!
SENIOR
Take your pants off.
EDUARDO
I know.
SENIOR
Mr. Saverin.
48.
EDUARDO
1) Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.
2) Harvard wasn't founded by John Harvard
and 3) That's not John Harvard.
SENIOR
who is it?
EDUARDO
A friend of the sculptor, Daniel. Chester-
SENIOR
You can?-.-tpi your shirt on.
And as another kid simply falls to his hands and knees and
throws up, we

As MARK, with his backpack stuffed, comes flying out of the
building and into the snow, barely keeping his balance on the
ice and we
CUT TO:
TNT. KIRKLAND HOUSE/LOBBY - MORNING
The heavy door bursts open and MARK comes busting through. He
makes his way with speed and intent up a flight of stairs.
Then another.
And then another until he gets to his floor. He sprints down
his hall toward his dorm room and barely notices EDUARDO
leaning against the door.
EDUARDO
We were supposed to meet at 9.
MARK is searching the pockets of his shorts for his keys.
EDUARDO (CONT'D)
Have you slept yet?
MARK opens the door and they go into his suite--
MARK
I have to add a feature.
EDUARDO
What are you adding?
52,
MARK's in his own world as he sits at the computer and calls
up theFacebook. The home page fills the screen.
EDUARDO (CONT'D)
(SIMPLY)
Shit.
(BEAT)
That looks good.
(BEAT)
That looks really good.
MARK
It's clean and simple. No flashing
lights.
The CAMERA surveys the screen as MARK slips through some
functions to show EDUARDO and we see things that are now
familiar--A photo, sex, a profile, a list of attributes, a
poke application, etc.
MARK (cONT' T) )
But watch.
MARK's called up a the Emacs program and quickly writes out
several lines of code...
EDUARDO
What'd you write?.
MARK goes back to the profile page. There's a new area to be
filled in...
MARK
"Relationship Status", "Interested In".
(BEAT)
These two things are what drive life at
college. Are you having sex or aren't
you. It's why people take certain
classes, sit`where they sit, go where
they go, do what they do, and at its, um,
center,`you know, that's what theFacebook
is gonna be about, People are gonna log
on because after all the cake and
watermelon there's a chance they're gonna-
EDUARDO
--meet a girl.
MARK
--get laid. Yes.
EDUARDO
Really?
MARK
(BEAT)
And that's it.
53.
EDUARDO
(BEAT)
What do you mean?
MARK
It's ready.
EDUARDO
It's ready?
MARK
Yeah.
EDUARDO
Right now?
MARK
It's ready, that was it. And here's the
masthead,
MARK hits another couple of keystrokes and the website's
masthead comes up.
EDUARDO
You made a masthead.
MARK
Yeah.
EDUARDO
(READING)
"Eduardo Saverin, Co-Founder and CFO."
MARK
Yeah.
EDUARDO
You have no idea how much that's going to
mean to my father.
MARK
Sure I do.
EDUARDO
(PAUSE)
When's it gonna go live?
MARK
Right now. Get your laptop out.
EDUARDO
Why do we need my laptop?
MARK
Because you've got e-mails for everyone
at the Phoenix.
54,
EDUARDO
(BEAT)
I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with
them that I spammed their--
MARK
It's not Spam.
EDUARDO
I didn't mean Spam, it's not Spam, it's
JUST THAT--
MARK
If we send it to our friends it'll just
bounce around the computer lab,
EDUARDO
I haven't gotten in yet.
MARK
These guys know people and these guys
know girls. I need their e-mails.
EDUARDO
(BEAT)
Sure.
EDUARDO takes out his laptop--
MARK
Let's start with the president.
EDUARDO
"Jabberwockl2@Harvard E-D-U."
MARK
Like the Lewis Carrol?
EDUARDO
Yeah.
MARK opens up an e-mail and is writing a short message, then
includes a link to the site--
MARK
These guys.
EDUARDO
I know,
MARK
Think they're literary geniuses because
the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll
reference is in their--
EDUARDO
They're not so bad.
55.
MARK
I'm just saying.
EDUARDO
You're right.
MARK
(DONE)
Okay.
He hits "Send".
MARK (CONT'D)
The site's live.
EDUARDO
(PAUSE)
You know what? Let's go get a drink and
celebrate.
MARK is staring at the computer...
EDUARDO (CONT'D)
Mark?
MARK doesn't hear him. We just see MARK's head from the back
and it's ever so slightly bobbing back and forth...
EDUARDO (CONT'D)
(PAUSE)
Mark?
(BEAT)
Are you praying?
CUT TO:
The lamps in Harvard Yard light the snow falling.
SPEAKER (VO)
The seminal event for me was when he was
in Harvard Square and picked up a copy of
Popular Electronics Magazine that ha the
MITS Altair Kit on the cover.
As the CROWD from the lecture spills out onto the snowy quad.
EDUARDO--always in his suit-.-is buttoning up his overcoat as
he walks and MARK zips up his hoodie.
EDUARDO
She said "Facebook me" and we can all
have a drink later. Which is stunningly
great for two reasons. One, she said
"Facebook me". Right? And the other is
that, you know--
MARK
They want to have drinks later.
EDUARDO
Yes: Have you ever heard so many
different good things packed into one
ordinary-sized sentence?
A group of guys hustle up to MARK and EDUARDO--
STUART
Excuse me. Mark?
MARK
Yeah.
STUART
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your O.S. lab.
MARK
Sure.
STUART
Awesome job with theFacebook.
VIKRAM
Awesome job.
MARK
Thanks.
BOB
I'm Bob.
MARK
How you doin'.
BOB
You know, I could swear he was looking at
you when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.
MARK
I doubt it.
69.
BOB
I showed up late, I don't even know who
he was.
MARK
(BEAT)
It was Bill Gates.
BOB
Oh shit, that makes sense.
As MARK and EDUARDO walk on, we leave STUART, VIKRAM and BOB in
the background---with STUART and VIKRAM admonishing BOB with--
STUART/VIKRAM
(TO BOB)
Are you a moron?/Are you medically
stupid?/You can't recognize Bill Gates
when he's standing in front of you for an
hour?/Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got
into Harvard on a dimwit scholarship./I'm
gonna get a Glock 39 and I'm going to
kill you./I'm actually going to kill
you/etc.
CUT TO:
MARK is standing on the roof of this small, campus-area house
as LOUD MUSIC plays. A zi'line is tied from the chimney and
runs down over a small swimming pool where it's attached to a
telephone pole on the other side.
MARK grabs onto the handle that's connected to the zip line
and flies out over the pool, jumping in with a splash and
cheers from DUSTIN and the INTERNS who are waiting their turns
on the roof.
DUSTIN pulls the handle back up with_a rope that's been
rigged, grabs the handle, takes off and jumps into the pool-to
similar cheers.
The handle gets pulled back on a rope, an INTERN grabs it,
JUMPS--
--and the brick chimney comes crashing down.
The INTERN drops into patio furniture as bricks from the
chimney come cascading down.
EVERYONE SCRAMBLES--
ALL
Shit!/Are you alright?!/ Jesus!/etc-
INTERN (ERIC)
I'm okay.
MARK
You sure?
ERIC
Yeah.
MARK
Is anything broken?
ERIC
No.
And at that moment a stray brick drops from the roof and
crashes through a glass patio table.
INTERN (STEVEN)
That's gonna out into the security
deposit.
From inside the DOORBELL RINGS--
DUSTIN
That's the doorbell.
MARK
I didn't know we had a doorbell.
DUSTIN
(SHOUTING INSIDE)
Andrew! Get the door!
MARY.
He's wired in.
MARK walks into--
An ultra-hip San Prancisco nightclub where a line of well-
dressed young people stretches from the clipboard holding
BOUNCER down the block. The BOUNCER motions to three SEXY
GIRLS who are let in through the velvet rope. If this reminds
us of the scene at the final club party at the beginning of
this story than that's fine.
The three SEXY GIRLS take us into
we're looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight
stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of
Henley, England--founded in 1179.
And after a moment of placid quiet--
---BOOSHI
Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for
the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and
prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.
The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The
port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the
Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a
pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" of
Harvard.
We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing
section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot
-- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n
blazers and brightly colored floral ties.
But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just
their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.
straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half
torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.
And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the
Dutch.
The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of
them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.
Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving
the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of
Americans.
124.
We'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex
we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next
to him is their mother, who can barely watch.
Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice
through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and
there's still no daylight between them.
We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin
to stream down his arm.
25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--
even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups
the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'
is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--
the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.
The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted
by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,
and pull, and pull, and pull, and---
POP!
--the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of
the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.
CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch
group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The
Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.
The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug
as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.
The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses
to look away.
From CAMERON and TYLER, just the'breathing.,
CUT TO:
CAMERON and TYLER are standing with their coaches and next to
the two DUTCH CREWMEN who are with their coaches. They're on a
stand in the Steward's Enclosure, a sprawling and glamorous
tented area for the exclusive use of members and their guests.
After a moment, a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps
out with his retinue in tow. The man is PRINCE ALBERT of
Monaco. He receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he
approaches the stand.
This conversation is done without microphones or anything as
modern as that.
125.
AIDE
His Royal Highness, Prince Albert. Sir,
may I present Mr. Cameron Winklevoss and
Mr. Tyler. Winklevoss of Harvard
University.
PRINCE ALBERT
Brilliant race. Never seen a race that
close. Less than one second, the steward
tells me.
TYLER
(BEAT)
Yes, Your Highness.
PRINCE ALBERT
My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of
the premiere rowers of his day. I've been
coming to Henley for 30 years. Never seen
a race that close. Have you? Have you
seen a race that close?
CAMERON is thinking about starting a war with Monaco right now
so he lets his brother do the talking.
TYLER
(BEAT)
No, Your Highness. Mile and a half races
are more commonly won by a boat length or
two.
PRINCE ALBERT
Yes, that's absolutely right. Less than a
second though in your case. Well as they
say, I suppose it just came down to who
wanted it more.
CAMERON
(SNAPPING)
Oh what a bullshit cliche: You think we
DIDN'T---
TYLER
(EASY)
Cam.
There's an awkward silence for a moment...
PRINCE ALBERT
Will I have the pleasure of watching you
both row again in Beijing?
TYLER
If we make the team, sir, yes. Thank you.
PRINCE ALBERT
I present you with your Second Place
ribbons. On to the champions!
126,
And off the APPLAUSE from the crowd, we
CUT TO:
The regatta party is underway. Music, drinks, uniformed
waiters, blazers and hats everywhere.
TYLER and CAMERON have changed into their Harvard. blazers and
are joined now by DIVYA. The three of them have tried to find
an unpopulated spot. TYLER and DIVYA have glasses of beer and
are standing but CAMERON's sitting at a table with a laptop
open and watching film of the end of the race.
Hitting reverse on the computer and watching, over and over
again, the bow of the Dutch boat pull ahead by six inches at
just the right moment.
CAMERON
Yeah. We didn't want it enough. That was
the problem. Fuck you, you fucking little--
DIVYA
Casa. The guy' s the prince of a country
the size of East Hampton. Let it go.
MR. WINKLEVOSS has made his way over...
MR. WINKLEVOSS
Boys.
TYLER
Dad.
MR. WINKLEVOSS
Divya.
DIVYA
How are-you, Mr. Winklevoss.
MR. WINKLEVOSS
That was a tough beat. A tough beat.
CAMERON
I'm sorry, dad. You and mom flew all the
way over.
MR. WINKLEVOSS
Listen to me good, you two. Don't you
ever apologize to me for losing a race
like that. Don't you ever apologize to
anyone for losing a race like that.
Another man comes along, MR. KENWRIGHT.
127.
KENWRIGHT
-Boys.
TYLER
Oh. Mr. Kenwright. Dad, this is Mr.
Kenwright, part of our host family this
week.
KENWRIGHT
Pleasure to meet you.
MR. WINKLEVOSS
Good to meet you.
KENWRIGHT
I just had the most extraordinary phone
chat with my daughter. She told me that
she and her friends are all talking about
the race, which ended just, a half-hour
ago, via their computers. A new website
called Facebook. Do you have this in
America?
Eve.ryon= is frozen...
DIVYA
(PAUSE)
Your daughter doesn't go to school in the
U.S.?
KENWRIGHT
No no. Cambridge. Majoring in French
Literature, though I wasn't aware there
was such a thing.
TYLER
(PAUSE)
They have Facebook at Cambridge?
RENWRIGHT
And Oxford, St. Andrews, Warwick and the
London School of Economics best as I can
tell. because that's where her friends
are.
MR. WINKLEVOSS
I'm going to find your mother.
KENWRIGIT
Good race, boys. Live to fight another
day.
TYLER
Thank you.
The men leave and CAMERON, TYLER and DIVYA are alone. CAMERON
looks at them for a moment, then turns back to watching the
RACE FILM--
128.
TYLER (CONT'D)
Turn it off.
(PAUSE)
Turn it off, Cam. Look at me.
CAMERON turns to his brother...
TYLER (CONT'D)
I don't mind that we got beat by the
Dutch by less than a second. That was a
fair race, that was a good race and they
had the better boat today and they'll see
us again. What I mind is that we got beat
by Mark Zuckerberg...by less than a
second.
(BEAT)
We tried the Ad Board, we tried the
president of the University and we tried
talking to him ourselves. Now I'm asking
you. For the one-hundreth time. Let's
take the considerable-resources at our
disposal and sue him in a federal. court.
CAMERON looks at his brother...then turns back to the
computer. He watches the Dutch boat pull ahead at the last
moment. TYLER and DIVYA are just about to give up when CAMERON
swings back and says--
CAMERON
Let's fucking gut that little nerd.
DIVYA
(jamming his fists in the air)
Finally!
CUT TO:
80 stories of polished granite.
A brand new black Escalade pulls up in front of a gleaming
glass and chrome office building.. SEAN is at the wheel and
MARK, in the passenger seat, is wearing brightly colored
pajamas with his hair a mess.
They get out of the car and huddle-on the sidewalk.
MARK
You sure about-this?
SEAN
Oh yes. You're 20 minutes late. You're
going to walk in there and say you
overslept. and you didn't have time to get
dressed, They're gonna pitch you, Sequoia
Capital is gonna pitch you. They're gonna
.tell you why you should take their money.
They're gonna beg you to take their
money, You're gonna nod, you're gonna
nod, you're. gonna nod and then you're
-gonna say, "Which one of you is Michael
Moritz?". Moritz is gonna say, "That's
me". And you're gonna say, "Sean Parker
says 'Fuck you.' And walk right on out.
MARK
(PAUSE)
Okay.
MARK heads into the office building.
145.
SEAN looks up to the windows of a high floor, points, and says--
SEAN
Fuck. You.
CUT TO:
We can hear the thumping music coming 'from the party inside
and college kids have spilled out onto the front lawn of this
pristine, four-columned house.
SEAN, freezing with no coat on, is sitting on the bottom of
the steps to the police station.'The LAWYER we've seen before
is standing in back of him.
SEAN
(INTO PHONE)
Listen, something's happened.
We see MARK listening on his end but can't hear SEAN's end of
the conversation.
MARK
(PAUSE)
Shit.
SEAN
It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've
posted bond-and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies so I can't----
We're back on MARK's side. He listens... listens...
MARK
17?
Back on SEAN's side-
SEAN
I think it was Moritz. I swear, I think
it was Michael Moritz.
MARK
(EVENLY)
This is gonna be news, Sean, it's gonna.
be online any second.
SEAN
(BEAT)
I know.
MARK

You know with anunderage intern and--
SEAN
It's cool, I've got it under control.
158,
MARK
(NO PANIC)
I'll get it under control. I'll call our
guys and see what the next move is. But
this is gonna be news now.
SEAN
You think it was Moritz? 'Cause I do. And
I'm gonna meet that guy in a dark alley
one night. Or Eduardo? Did Eduardo have
me followed?
MARK
(cool as ice)
Go home, Sean. I'll call our people.
MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment.
He looks at the small package. that Ashleigh dropped on his
desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there's
a box.
He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He
takes one of the business cards out and looks at it.
I'm CEO ...Bitoh
And over this we HEAR a woman's voice...
MARYLIN (V.0.)
