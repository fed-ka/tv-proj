          The number says 1-3-3-0... Johnny moves to the front door
          and rings the bell... it's a nondescript, tiny house
          surrounded by woods.  The kind of little house you'd drive
          by a thousand times and never notice.  It is freshly
          painted and well kept up.


          THE FRONT DOOR

          opens to reveal Jeffrey Grissom, dressed in a sweater,
          using his cane... looking sternly, even suspiciously out...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Yes?

          Looking at Johnny with his cane, they seem almost like a
          mirror image... and perhaps we might wonder if Johnny
          isn't looking at a version of his own future self.  Jeffrey
          is gruff throughout.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Grissom, my name's John Smith. 
                        I--

                                        JEFFREY
                        How do you know my name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, we share a grocery boy.  He
                          accidentally delivered my capers
                        to you last week.

                                        JEFFREY
                              (a test)
                        What's his name?  The grocery
                        boy?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reacts to the test)
                        Raul...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Those were your capers?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yessir.

                                        JEFFREY
                        For a veal piccata perhaps?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (smiles)
                        How'd you guess?

                                        JEFFREY
                        Do you know what they do to those
                          animals?  So you can eat your
                          precious veal?

          Johnny isn't quite sure what to say... 

                                        JEFFREY
                        Think about that the next time
                        you take a bite of animal flesh.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yessir, I probably will now.

                                        JEFFREY
                        I don't have your capers any
                        longer.  I returned them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  Raul brought them back. 
                        He told me you don't get a lot of
                          visitors and I thought...

                                        JEFFREY
                        You play chess?

                                        JOHNNY
                          A little.

                                        JEFFREY
                        I can play down to your level if
                        I have to.  Come in.

          Johnny enters... Jeffrey looks around - an old habit - to
          see if anyone is watching outside...



            Johnny/Jeffrey standing in a tiny outdoor French
            nightclub... a female SINGER with an accordion sings the
          same song and we segue to her version without missing a
          beat...  it's early in the morning... only a few patrons
            remain... this is the last song in her set...


          WIDER

          the money shot to see Johnny/Jeffrey at this bistro along
          the Seine... the Eiffel Tower in the background...


          CLOSER

            Johnny/Jeffrey is wearing a trenchcoat, hands in his
          pocket.

          A STREET MAINTENANCE MAN sweeps up outside the restaurant
          gaining Johnny's attention... he makes pointed eye contact
          with Johnny/Jeffrey... something here isn't quite right...

          The girl sings directly to Johnny/Jeffrey, smiles
            seductively...

                                        FRENCH SINGER
                        "Make all the memories*
                          disappear"...*

          as he returns and his eyes wander naturally to the record
            player... as the song ends...

          Jeffrey watches Johnny listening to the song... as it
          ends...

                                        JOHNNY*
                        I think you gave me the wrong
                        cane.

                                        JEFFREY
                        Did I?  Sorry.

          Johnny hands him back his cane, retrieves his own.

                                        ALMA
                        Say good-bye, Jeffrey.

                                (evenly)
                        It's been a pleasure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You still owe me a game of chess.  

                                        ALMA
                        Have a lovely day, Mr. Smith.

          She opens the door for him to leave and he exchanges a
          last look with Jeffrey who studies him evenly but seems
          under the thumb of this nurse somehow.  But for now there's
          nothing to do but to exit... and as he does...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                              ACT TWO

          FADE IN:


          Bruce and Johnny approach the front door, Johnny with a
          file in hand.  Johnny rings the bell.  After a beat, a
          young woman (JUNE STADE, late 20's, plain) opens the door. 
          She's cordial.

                                        MRS. STADE
                        Yes?

          Johnny reacts to the new face...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, hi, I was looking for Mr.
                          Grissom.

                                        MRS. STADE
                        Who?

          Johnny does a take...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jeffrey Grissom.

                                        MRS. STADE
                        Are you sure you have the right
                          address?

          Johnny can't believe this... glances at Bruce...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Of, of course, I have the right
                        address... Jeffrey... 70s, tall,
                        uses a cane, doesn't eat meat...

                                        MRS. STADE
                                (overlapping, growing
                                  concern)
                        I don't know what to say... there's
                        no one named Jeffrey here...

          Johnny gathers himself, incredulous... he looks at the
          house, the street, checks the number... a long beat while
          this happens...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was just here yesterday with
                        Jeffrey Grissom...

                                        MRS. STADE
                        You must be mistaken.  I live
                        here with my husband...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (studies her, evenly)
                        You live here with your husband.

          She looks at Bruce...

                                        MRS. STADE
                        I'm sorry but I don't know any...
                                (Jeffrey Grissom)

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's lying...

          She reacts to the accusation...

                                        MRS. STADE
                        I beg your pardon...?

                                        BRUCE
                        John, maybe we...

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's lying. 

                                        MRS. STADE
                        I'm going to call the police...

          Johnny reaches out to touch her... she recoils in fear...
          slams the door; Johnny just gets his hand out of the way
          in time...

                        This is the right house.

          Johnny starts touching the house... a curtain at the window
          moves... a five year old face peeks out and disappears...

                        I'll call the police.



          The door opens to reveal a man in his early thirties...
          this is BILL STADE... he reacts as he sees Johnny and

                          I didn't try to grab her.  I tried

3737A JOHNNY VISION - STEADICAM 

          We RAMP from Johnny's face to underneath the car, where
          we find...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 3 - 12/9/02 GRN    35.

          A TINY RADIO TRANSMITTER, COMPLETE WITH BLINKING LED

          But that isn't the end of it -- steadicam RAMPS back up
          to Johnny's face...  Johnny's head turns... and then NDS
          follows his line of sight... we sail out of Johnny's yard,
          riding the transmitter's signal, eventually coming to a
          "General Sign and Lighting" van a block away... we go
          inside to see the two black bad guys from Johnny's house. 
          With their ski caps off, we can see one of them is Alma
          (the first Alma), the other Bill Stade.  She has an
          earphone in her ear...

          as he reacts.  Coolly, he gets in his car and starts it.



          As the jeep comes out... passes the van...



          as it moves up to find...


          POV - JOHNNY'S JEEP

          parked outside a convenience store... Johnny has just
          gotten out, is going inside...

    42CONTINUED:42


          as it moves past the convenience store and parks within
          the line of sight this time...



          Fast motion as before: Jeffrey is loaded into the back of
          an ambulance... as the doors are shut, the ambulance moves
          directly toward us, headlights filling the screen... giving
            a natural wipe to a county line sign as the headlights
          brush across it as they pass:  ENTERING AROOSTOOK COUNTY. 
          Finding the ambulance pulling up to a new suburban house.


  4545EXTREME CLOSE-UP - JOHNNY'S EYES


          NEW ANGLE - AS THE VAN BURNS RUBBER AS IT PULLS SHARPLY
          AWAY

          and Johnny releases the grip or risk losing an arm... but
          we stay on his face... as he smiles...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        Too late, Alma.  Cause now I know.



          as Johnny examines the transmitter, glances around and
          sticks it to the bumper of a high rider Puerto Rican hot
          rod which takes off a beat later for places unknown...

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:


            AROOSTOOK COUNTY



          As seen in Johnny's vision.  The jeep pulls into the
            driveway.  Johnny gets out, his anticipation is hard to
          contain, he moves to the door... and that's when he hears
          it... the music from inside... "Winter Snow"... he*
            smiles... rings the bell... after a beat, the door opens
          to reveal Jeffrey in his same favorite sweater... he barely
          cracks an expression...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (smiles)
                          Jeffrey, you are a sight for sore
                        eyes.

                                        JEFFREY
                        It took you long enough.  Not
                        much of a psychic, huh.

          And as he leads Johnny inside...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:


            Johnny/Jeffrey at this bistro along the Seine... the Eiffel
          Tower in the background...


          CLOSER - JOHNNY/JEFFREY

          in his trenchcoat, standing in the tiny outdoor French
            nightclub... the female SINGER with an accordion sings
          the same song and we segue to her version as before...
          it's early in the morning... only a few patrons remain...
          this is the last song in her set...

                                        FRENCH SINGER
                        It's just the thought of you...

          But this time we have a new angle and we include the
          elderly version of Jeffrey who stands a few feet behind
            Johnny/Jeffrey on the cobblestone street talking to Johnny,
          and remembering as he so often remembers...

                                        JEFFREY
                        She was the last woman I ever
                        loved as Jeffrey Grissom... the
                        kind of woman that stays with you
                        a long time... her eyes haunt me
                        in the middle of the night... and
                        her song plays over and over...

          THE STREET MAINTENANCE MAN sweeps up outside the restaurant
          gaining Johnny/Jeffrey's attention... Johnny/Jeffrey and
          Jeffrey turn in unison to make eye contact... something
          here isn't quite right...

          The girl sings directly to Johnny/Jeffrey, smiles
            seductively...

                                        FRENCH SINGER
                        Make all the memories disappear...*

          She finishes the song, the set, looks to Johnny/Jeffrey,
          blows him a kiss... as she disappears inside the
            restaurant... the last customers scatter... a beat later,
          the maintenance man moves quickly inside behind her into
          the darkness of the pub...

                                        JEFFREY
                        She betrayed us.  People had died.

          From their vantage point, the darkness of the bistro is
          interrupted by silent flashes of an muzzle (we don't see
          the gun itself, just the flashes)... several times... 
          after a beat, Johnny/Jeffrey walks quietly away down the
          cobblestone street... but old Jeffrey stands there,
          staring, as he has done all his life...

                                        JEFFREY
                        There are always sides.

          The vision ends.


  5454RESUME

          Johnny studies him.  Jeffrey's mind lingers in the past
          for his first line:

                                        JEFFREY
                        That's when I became the man nobody
                        ever knew, a man of a thousand
                          identities... who can no longer
                        hang on to even one. 
                                  (reconnects with Johnny)
                        Esse est percipi...*
                                (off Johnny's reaction)*
                        George Berkeley, eighteenth century*
                          philosopher.  'To be is to be*
                          perceived.' 
                                (he moves to study*
                                the photograph)*
                        Sometimes, I look in the mirror*
                        and I wonder if Jeffrey Grissom
                        still exists at all... or is he
                        gone like the house I grew up
                        in...

                                        JOHNNY*
                        I can't tell you if the house
                        still exists or not... but I know
                        where to look for it...

            Jeffrey's eyes brighten at that... until from off-screen --

                                        ALMA (O.S.)
                        I'm afraid we won't have time for
                        that now.

          They look to see Alma and the Stades.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Leave the kid home, did we?

                                (to Johnny)
                        I want to thank-you for sending
                        us to the Puerto Rican Independence
                        Rally.  It was very informative.

                                        JEFFREY
                        What is this about deporting Raul?

                                        ALMA
                        Come on, Jeffrey, you've been at
                        this long enough; we had to protect
                        you...

                                        JEFFREY
                        As though you had any interest in
                        protecting me...

                                        ALMA
                        We've always protected you,
                          Jeffrey.

                                        JEFFREY
                        You have protected the secrets. 
                        While I've been a prisoner...

                                        ALMA
                        We have to get ready to move again,
                        Jeffrey...

                                        JEFFREY
                        No.  
                                  (controlled)
                        He says he can help me find my
                        house.

                                        MRS. STADE
                        Mr. Smith will be coming with us.

          It's said evenly.  And yet Jeffrey instantly knows that
          Johnny's life is in jeopardy...

                                        JEFFREY
                        That is an overreaction.  He knows
                          nothing.

          Johnny's just beginning to catch on...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I don't know what you're

                        We're just going to follow you
                        home, Mr. Smith, debrief you, ask
                        you to take an oath of silence.

                        They're lying.

                          Jeffrey, don't be silly, it's not
                        like the old days.

                                        JEFFREY
                        Let me talk to the Secretary;
                        he'll listen to me.  He has no
                        idea how valuable Smith could be.

                                        ALMA
                        We've already talked to the
                        Secretary.  Say good-bye, Jeffrey.

                                        JEFFREY
                                (to Johnny)
                        Listen very carefully.  You are a
                        threat to national security.  By
                        now, I'm sure all of your friends
                        think you have been acting
                          erratically.

          Johnny looks at him incredulously... these things don't
            happen... do they?  He looks to Alma, the Stades all of
          whom have even expressions...

                                        MR. STADE
                        Mr. Smith, no harm will come to
                        you.  We really have to insist.

                                        JEFFREY
                        They will either find you in a
                        car accident in the woods... or
                        not find you at all.  You will
                        disappear.

          And the very first vision that Johnny had comes back to
          fill his mind...  Alma gives the Stades a signal to take
          Johnny by force if necessary... but the doorbell rings...

          Reactions.  Who could this be...

          Mrs. Stade glances out a window... eyes widen as she turns
          back...

                        There are reporters on the front
                        lawn.

                        I was about to mention that I
                        invited a few media people over...
                        just wanted to make sure someone
                        else saw Jeffrey this time...
                                (beat, to Jeffrey)
                        I think you and I were about to
                        go look for a house?

          Off Jeffrey's grin...



          A media frenzy greets Johnny outside... and more media
          cars and vans are arriving...  Dana is there...  She makes
          eye contact with Johnny as he escorts Jeffrey to the jeep,
          Jeffrey leaning heavily on his cane is slow and frail but
            determined... the reporters yell questions on top of
            questions -- Johnny, what's this all about, do you really
          know where Jimmy Hoffa is?, what about Amelia Earhardt,
          who is this guy, Johnny?   Sir, what's your connection to
          Johnny Smith...

          Over the din...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you all for coming... could
                        you give us some room please...
                        we just need to get to the car...
                        no, I can't answer any questions
                        yet...

          Dana elbows her way to Johnny...

                                        DANA
                        What the hell is going on, John? 
                        Amelia Earhart?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dana, I'll explain later... 

                                        DANA
                        Who is this man? 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        Just an old friend of the family. 
                        Please, just help me get out of
                        here...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN   46A.

          Dana sees the urgency in Johnny's eyes as he helps Jeffrey
          into the Jeep... but his path is blocked by the press...

                                        DANA
                                (loudly, to other
                                  reporters)
                        The press conference's been moved,
                        folks.  Follow this Jeep!

          The reporters scramble back to their cars...  Johnny's
          eyes express his thanks to Dana...  Dana smiles a "you
          owe me one" to Johnny...

                                        JEFFREY
                        If it would help, I can tell you...
                                (off Johnny's
                                  expression)
                        ...what happened to Amelia Earhart.

          Off Johnny's reaction as he starts the car...



          With the jeep in the lead...



          The jeep leads the caravan into a left turn following a
          sign that says "Litchfield, 5mi"...



          The jeep continues on... the caravan follows...



          As the jeep and cars behind it arrive and are forced to
          stop...



          There is no sign of a road... Jeffrey shakes his head...
          something's not right about this...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

          In the distance, a train horn sounds... his ears perk
          up...

                                        JEFFREY
                        I've heard that before.  I've
                        heard that sound before.  I'm
                        famous for my ears.

          Jeffrey moves into the brush and pushes foliage aside...
          to reveal an old dirt drive...

                                        JEFFREY
                        You see, John, it does exist.  We
                        just couldn't perceive it.

          Johnny turns to the reporters who are getting out of their
          cars, wondering what the hell is going on...  Dana is
          right at the front...  Johnny takes her by the arm...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Please, just hold them off a little
                        while longer...

                                        DANA
                        Hold them off?  How am I supposed
                        to do that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell them... tell them I need to
                        get something out of the woods... 
                          Something amazing...

                                        DANA
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll let you know when I find it.

          Johnny follows Jeffrey into the woods, down the old dirt
          drive...  Dana turns and flags down the other reporters...

                                        DANA
                        Folks, if you'll set up your
                        cameras here... Johnny will be
                        making a statement shortly...          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN   49A.

          as Johnny and Jeffrey come around a rise on the wooded,
            overgrown road... they see it... that leaded glass window
          on that old farmhouse, falling apart, in front of them...

          Jeffrey looks at it, smiles...

                                        JEFFREY
                        Wait here for me, John.

          Johnny acknowledges as Jeffrey squeezes his shoulder in
            appreciation, eyes never leaving the house, and as they
          touch, push to Johnny as he sees --


  6868P.O.V. - JEFFREY'S MOTHER

          standing on the front porch in 1928 - in period clothes...
          and we'll say, more for production than any other reason,
          that it's still dilapidated, but on the long lens that
          focuses only on the woman, softening all around her, it's
          kind of hard to tell anyway... his father reads the paper
          at a table.

          They are lower class but possess an honest, rural dignity.

                                        JEFFREY'S MOTHER
                        There you are, Jeffrey.

          studies him as --


          NEW ANGLE - JEFFREY

          moves out of view into the old house... a beat later,
          Johnny turns to see Alma and the Stades moving behind
          him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Guess you guys just didn't try
                        very hard to find his old house...
                        it really wasn't that hard...

                                        ALMA
                                (evenly)
                        Jeffrey Grissom was our top
                          operative during the Cold War,
                        Mr. Smith... until today, twenty
                        two countries had incontrovertible
                        proof that he died sixteen years
                        ago in Berlin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sixteen years is a long time to
                        be in prison, any kind of prison,
                        Alma. 

                                        ALMA
                        The name is Rosemary.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Were you really going to kill me,
                          Rosemary?

          She gives him a look: are you serious?

                                        ALMA/ROSEMARY
                                (utterly sincere)
                        Jeffrey has always had a flair
                        for the dramatic.

          They look at each other without blinking for a long long
          beat.  Finally, Johnny looks back toward the house. 
          Jeffrey has not returned.  A beat.          DEAD ZONE: MAN WHO NEVER WAS - ACT 4 - 12/9/02 GRN    51.
