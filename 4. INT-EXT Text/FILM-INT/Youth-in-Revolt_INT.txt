...sprawled on the bed, trousers around his ankles, a well
thumbed issue of Penthouse covers his privates.
NICK (V.O.)
My last name, which I loath, is
Twisp.
Nick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed. He pulls
the drawer under his mattress out.
NICK (V.O.)
The next thing you should know
about me is that I am obsessed with
sex.
A view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly
filed issues of Penthouse and Hustler. He puts the most
recently utilized magazine in its place.
NICK (V.O.)
Lately, I have become morbidly
aware of my penis.
Nick posing in front of the mirror, pants around his ankles
again. He looks at himself from various angles.
NICK (V.O.)
Once a remote region accessed
indifferently for micturition, it
has developed overnight into a
gaudy Las Vegas of the body.
We PAN DOWN, and where Nick's crotch is supposed to be, there
is a hole in the screen leading us to...
2.
LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY
The pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: NICK'S PENIS.
We fly inside where we find a star-studded floor show.
Drunken CONVENTIONEERS make out with STRIPPERS. A LEOPARD
leaps through a burning HOOP on stage.
Nick typing on an obsolete PC.
NICK (V.O.)
I am entering the tenth grade at
St. Vitus Academy, which, I am
told, is the most rigorous prep
school in the East Bay. Hopefully I
will be invited to join Miss
Satron's English Literature class.
A view of the books and CDs on his shelf.
NICK (V.O.)
I am a voracious reader and listen
to Frank Sinatra. So needless to
say, I am still a virgin.
Follow the curser on the monitor as he types the words -
STILL A VIRGIN.
He pauses in thought, then continues.
NICK (V.O.)
I have yet to hold hands with a
girl, let alone have my winkie up
her wendell.
WE MOVE down an airplane aisle, past PASSENGERS sleeping and
chatting.
NICK (V.O.)
I am an only child except for my
big sister Joanie, who has left the
bosom of her family to sling hash
at 35,000 feet.
We reach the end of the aisle, where a buxom twenty-
something, JOANIE TWISP serves a beverage.
Liver frying in a pan. ESTELLE TWISP, 43, cooks and puffs on
a cigarette at the same time.
3.
NICK (V.O.)
Mom gives driver's tests at the
Department of Motor Vehicles.
Nick sits at the kitchen table reading the paper. He watches
with nausea as Estelle piles liver onto his plate.
NICK (V.O.)
She used to keep Dad up to date on
all the motor statutes he was
violating. This is one of the
reasons they got divorced.
JERRY, early 40's, saunters in wearing a TRUCKERS DO IT IN
OVERDRIVE shirt and boxers. His gut hangs over the elastic,
but he is completely devoid of an ass.
NICK (V.O.)
Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long
distance trucker, though his
ultimate ambition is to be on state
disability.
Jerry absently smacks Estelle's butt. Waddles over to the
breakfast table. He snatches the Funnies from the paper in
Nick's hands.
NICK (V.O.)
I've been struggling to think of a
commendable thing to say about
Jerry.
Jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon. Nick glares.
NICK (V.O.)
No luck. His grey matter registers
at cretin and the needle doesn't
budge.
We're back with Nick as he types on his computer. He looks
down at the tent in his boxers.
CUT TO:
He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection.
NICK'S POV
of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing. His
eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room.
NICK (V.O.)
My mother is the one who painted my
room to look like Dolly Parton's
boudoir. She read this color was
used in hospitals to calm mental
patients.
Nick closes his eyes, his right arm moving rhythmically.
NICK (V.O.)
I'll tell you what I told her. I am
not mentally ill.
BLACKNESS. The masturbation reaches its feverous climax. Then
the long moan and sigh of relief.
NICK (V.O.)
I'm just a teenager.
And as Frank Sinatra's UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG
begins, we go to OPENING CREDITS.
5.
YOUTH IN REVOLT
Nick regards Jerry from across the dining room table. There
is the off-screen sound of a cretin slurping Cheerios.
Reveal Jerry reading Sports Illustrated, scratching his balls
with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other. Estelle
is washing dishes when she spies something out the window.
ESTELLE
Jerry? Where did that car come
from?
Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to
appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive.
JERRY
It's a '62 Lincoln convertible.
Like the one Kennedy was shot in.
NICK
Except his was black and yours is
white. And dirty.
JERRY
See that. I was going to take you
and your mom for a spin after
breakfast. But now I guess it'll
just be her and me. You have your
smart mouth to thank for that.
NICK
Damn it. I guess I'll just have to
hang out all alone at the book
depository.
JERRY
The what?
ESTELLE
Jerry, I don't understand. What
happened to the Chevy-Nova?
JERRY
Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda
Naval Air Base. A man should never
own a car for more than three
months, Estelle. That way he always
gets the thrill of owning a new
automobile!
Jerry smiles with cretin pride. Nick looks to his mother and
disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner
savvy.
6.
ON A TV SCREEN
Nick cycles through TiVo and finds the late night SEX
DOCUMENTARY he recorded.
From the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the
jingle jangle of a belt buckle.
Then the DING-DONG of the front doorbell.
The jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second
time, the orgy gets muted.
Nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers.
I/E. ESTELLE'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER
The door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed SAILORS
standing on the stoop.
7.
Their eyes drift to Nick's mid-section.
Nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to
fasten out of haste. He returns his gaze to the sailors as he
wrangles the belt.
SAILOR #1
Is Jerry here?
NICK
He just left. What's up?
SAILOR #1
What's up is that hunk of shit
Chevy he sold us made it seventeen
miles before the engine blew up.
SAILOR #2
And we found evidence of a banana
in the transmission.
The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a
plastic bag. Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking
Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job.
A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open
garage. He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can.
Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop.
SAILOR #1
So he owes us nine hundred dollars.
NICK
Well, I think he used that nine
hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln.
He's giving my mom a joyride in it
now. But he'll be back this
afternoon, so I would come back
then. He's pretty stubborn. You
might have to beat it out of him.
SAILOR #1
That can be arranged. In the
meantime we're leaving the piece of
shit in the driveway. With a note.
Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor
finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE.
NICK
I like it. Very to the point.
Well... See you guys this
afternoon!
The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor.
As they turn to go and Nick closes the door...
8.
LEFTY (V.O.)
I might have to kill myself.
JERRY
Nick, you little shit, get down
here!
Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the
window. Nick calmly joins them from upstairs.
ESTELLE
Nick, do you know anything about
this?
She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and
the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood.
NICK
Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by.
They want their money back. I guess
there was a banana in the
transmission.
JERRY
You tell them when I was coming
back?
10.
NICK
Now why would I do that?
Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence.
ESTELLE
What are you going to do, Jerry?
JERRY
I think I'll go get the Lincoln
washed.
ESTELLE
You're leaving? What happens when
the sailor comes back for his nine-
hundred dollars?
JERRY
Just tell him he bought the car
with my standard guarantee. Thirty
days or thirty feet. Whichever
comes first. I'm in the right.
And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the
simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door.
They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front
steps.
NICK
Oh, look. The sailors are here.
Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another,
searching for a hiding space as he hisses.
JERRY
Get rid of them!
And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors
pour in. Jerry flees. A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for
the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in.
Jerry bolts up the stairs.
NICK
Jerry, where are you going? Just
tell them you are in the right.
They manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the
stairs. Jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a
sound not unlike E.T. when the flashlight hit him in the
cornfield.
The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground
while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets.
11.
SAILOR #1
Sixty-three lousy dollars.
JERRY
That's my life savings!
One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he
whimpers.
ESTELLE
Don't hurt him! Nick, call 911!
SAILOR #1
Touch that phone, kid, and you lose
your left nut.
Nick raises his hands. "You don't have to tell me twice."
JERRY
Please. Please don't hurt me. It's
all I got, guys. I swear. Take the
Lincoln!
SAILOR #1
I don't want the Lincoln. I want my
nine-hundred dollars. I'm taking
the sixty-three, which means you
owe me another eight hundred and
thirty.
NICK
Eight hundred and thirty seven,
actually.
SAILOR #1
Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or
you'll be found in the trunk of
your new used piece of shit at the
bottom of the Bay.
And with that they release him and Jerry crumples to the
floor like an abandoned marionette.
The three of them watch the fleet pile into a Navy van that
reads FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. The moment they pull out, Jerry
dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed.
JERRY
Wow, those guys are even dumber
than I thought. They actually think
I'm stupid enough to let them
muscle me into paying.
12.
ESTELLE
Jerry, what are you talking about?
We need to call the police!
JERRY
I'm not some tattle-tale like your
son.
Nick rolls his eyes.
ESTELLE
Then for God's sake, Jerry, just
sell the Lincoln and pay them!
JERRY
Can't. It's in The Code.
ESTELLE
What code? The vehicular code?
JERRY
Code of the streets, Babe. Code of
the streets.
ESTELLE
Then what are you planning to do?
Jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts The
Thinker pose. He strokes his chin as Nick and Estelle await
his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation.
I/E. LINCOLN - DAY
NICK (V.O.)
We are going to Ukiah for a last
minute vacation.
Jerry's got on a hat made from Coors beer cans. He's behind
the wheel of his Lincoln convertible.
NICK (V.O.)
Jerry says we'll be staying in a
cabin on Clear Lake that's owned by
a friend of his.
Estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk. Her
halter top looks like an advertisement for Droop City. Nick's
in the back. Estelle waves at the neighbors like she's Miss
Corn Dog of 1954.
ESTELLE
Goodbye, everyone! We're going on
vacation!
JERRY
Let's blow!
13.
She hops up front with Jerry. He fires up the Lincoln and the
radio roars to life with HILLBILLY MUSIC.
NICK (V.O.)
I'm not sure how this is the
solution to his problem. But I've
decided to go along with it, seeing
as I'm not rooting for him anyway.
As they pull out, Jerry tosses his beer bottle at the garbage
can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and
shatters on the street behind them.
Substitute cluttered for cute. The three of them are crammed
around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray
table. 3-D religious art hangs on the wall above them.
JERRY
I say the kid does the dishes and
we retire to the master bedroom.
Jerry pushes out and disappears into the back. Nick watches
him with loathing. Estelle smiles apologetically.
NICK
Mom? Do you really like Jerry?
Her smile fades.
14.
ESTELLE
Nick, how
many men do you think
there are
who'd be interested in a
forty-one
year old woman with two
brats, no
money, and stretch marks?
And with that she excuses herself, leaving Nick to ponder.
NICK (V.O.)
Mom is a realist about everything.
Except her age. She's forty-three.
Nick washes dishes in the toilet-like sink. The trailer
shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the back.
Nick sleeps on a pull out cot. He bolts upright at the
banging, his hair going in all directions.
MRS. SAUNDERS (O.S.)
It's your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders.
Church services begin at seven
fifteen prompt. Donuts will be
served.
Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers.
Mrs. Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen
door and takes off.
An austere
cement shed with three dripping shower heads and
no privacy
walls. Nick lathers up under the spray. Jerry
appears in
the foreground and removes his robe. He goes to
the shower
head next to Nick and turns it on.
Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing
himself off. Jerry gurgles water and spits. He starts
warbling rock lyrics.
A lot more space than My Green Haven. Dark paneling and
somewhat more tasteful religious art.
SHEENI
Back in a moment.
18.
Nick watches her bound up the stairs.
He wanders into the musty living area. Moves down the mantel
examining the trinkets. Stops to regard the reproduction of
Massaccio's Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden on the wall.
He scrutinizes the image, his eyes falling to the privates of
Adam and Eve.
MR. SAUNDERS (O.S.)
I understand you have invited my
daughter to the beach.
Nick spins around to see MR. SAUNDERS reclining in his
armchair. He is an immense, florid-faced, verdant eye-browed
ogre in a rumpled blue suit.
NICK
Er, yes, Mr. Saunders.
MR. SAUNDERS
Aha! Then I trust, sir, you are
aware that in doing so you have
entered into an oral contract to
perform in loco parentis, i.e. to
provide for the safety and well-
being of aforementioned minor
female.
SHEENI (O.S.)
Oh, Father, do shut up.
Sheeni descends the stairs. Jean cut-offs over a knockout
yellow swimsuit that shows off her flowing nubility.
Mr. Saunders grumbles. Sheeni grabs up a straw beach bag and
pushes Nick out the door.
SHEENI
Let's go, Nick. Bye, Father.
MR. SAUNDERS
Vaya con Dios!
TIME LAPSE of Nick thrashing about in bed. During this
montage there is the constant ticking of a clock.
NICK (V.O.)
Here is an hour by hour account of
the worst night of my life.
Nick flipping through a Penthouse under the covers.
NICK (V.O.)
1 AM. I decide it is just a case of
puppy love and look forward to the
interesting women I shall meet in
the future.
Nick at the dining table, writing a note.
NICK (V.O.)
2 AM. I conclude the only way out
is suicide. I begin to pen a
poignant suicide note. Sheeni will
see Trent for the shallow pedant he
is and always treasure my memory.
JERRY (O.S.)
Turn off the damn light!
Nick is in bed jerking off. The trailer shakes despite his
best efforts.
NICK (V.O.)
4 AM. I can not die an inviolate
virgin. Either I find a way to get
laid soon or suicide gets postponed
until after high school.
JERRY (O.S.)
You wanna beat your meat, go
outside!
Nick in the shower going to town on his T.E.
NICK (V.O.)
5 AM. It will be too painful to see
Sheeni again. I shall ask Mom if we
can cut our vacation short and
return to Oakland.
Nick rolls over on the cot and looks up with the gaze of a
manic insomniac.
NICK (V.O.)
6 AM. Violent panic! I have to see
Sheeni again!
The door opens to reveal Nick standing outside in shorts, an
I'M SINGLE, LET'S MINGLE shirt, and tennis shoes. Sheeni
stands in the door. Sleep-fogged eyes.
NICK
Good morning!
SHEENI
Nick? God what time is it?
NICK
Seven o'clock. How about breakfast?
SHEENI
(smiling with endearment)
Come back in two hours. I'm going
on a hike. You can join me if you'd
like.
She closes the door.
23.
Super:
One hour fifty seven minutes later
A knock on the door. Sheeni opens it to reveal... Nick,
dressed the same. Sheeni wears Khakis, red bandanna
neckerchief, and an Australian bush hat. She looks like the
world's most desirable Girl Scout. She examines Nick's
attire.
SHEENI
Nick, where are your hiking boots,
water bottle, provisions, survey
maps and compass?
NICK
Like John Muir I enter the
wilderness with nothing more than
my journal and a childlike sense of
wonder.
SHEENI
Okay, but I have no plans to baby
any slackers.
Nick dines at the tray table with Jerry and Estelle.
ESTELLE
So what's this Sheeni girl like?
NICK
She's the Encyclopedia Britannica.
JERRY
She's got a nice rack.
ESTELLE
Jerry!
Jerry chuckles. Nick stares at him, perhaps resolving to
murder the trucker in his sleep.
Nick lies below us on the cot, unable to sleep with the
anticipation of the imminent loss of his virginity.
The women's side has real stalls and privacy doors. Nick
spots the chamber at the end where Sheeni's naked form
showers, obscured by tacky stained glass.
He kicks off his slippers. Hangs his robe on a hook.
He approaches the stall.
Flashing super:
Thundering Erection
He opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray.
He embraces her. Pendulous breasts, sagging skin, a patch of
white hair under a drooping belly, wrinkles... It's Mrs.
Saunders! She looks up startled.
Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream. Mrs. Saunders
starts screaming too, the sound of a pig being slaughtered.
She hurls a bar of soap.
The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his footing
on the slippery tile. He goes down, taking Mrs. Saunders with
him. They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape.
MRS. SAUNDERS
RAPE! RAAAAAPE!
Suddenly the door opens. It's Sheeni in her robe. She reaches
out and pulls Nick up.
SHEENI
Get out quick!
Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her
mother. Nick grabs his robe and retreats.
Nick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as
he brings his coffee to his lips. He hears the door open and
looks up, but instead of the cops finds Sheeni. She joins him
at the table.
NICK
Should I go to the sheriff's now?
SHEENI
No. I managed to convince Mother
you were retarded and couldn't read
the sign.
28.
Nick nods thankfully.
NICK
Say, where were you anyway?
We
said five minutes to six.
SHEENI
I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are
always discreetly late. It's
expected of us.
NICK
Swell. And the punctual guy fries
in the chair for rape.
SHEENI
Don't complain. At least you got to
shower with a naked woman.
(licking donut powder off
her fingers)
What are your plans today?
NICK
My parents want to go to
Middletown. Jerry has the moronic
notion of buying a trailer there
before we leave.
SHEENI
I should like to come with you,
Nick. The more time we spend
together the better. I fear when
you leave we might never see each
other again.
Nick nods glumly. Clearly a devastating thought.
Sheeni's in back with Nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind
tunnel. She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks.
Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of
his thigh.
As they round a curve at 60, she yanks Nick's sunglasses off
and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake.
The Lincoln now tows the rusty RV behind it. Nick watches
Sheeni continue to fawn over Albert.
Nick and Sheeni dine over coffee and a plate of donuts. Nick
watches her play with Albert in her lap.
NICK
Sheeni, I think I love you.
SHEENI
Well, your hormones certainly do.
And oddly enough, my hormones like
you too.
31.
Sheeni releases Albert and the mutt paws at her legs. Her
eyes well up with tears, a few theatrical sniffles.
NICK
Sheeni? It's... It's okay. We can
visit each other when I get a
drivers license.
SHEENI
I hope that's true, but.. It's not
that. It's...
NICK
What?
SHEENI
It's my parents. They're... I fear
they will never allow me to keep
Albert.
NICK
Oh.
Nick tries to hide his hurt. Picks up the paper with
annoyance.
SHEENI
(SNIFFLING)
Nick, honey. Why don't you take
Albert? He could be our love child.
NICK
No way.
SHEENI
At least you could consider it,
honey. For me. I've never asked you
for anything before.
NICK
Maybe I could take him, but I'd
have certain conditions. I would
have to be the only dad on the
scene.
(matter of fact)
Trent would have to go.
SHEENI
That's asking a lot. Trent worships
the ground I walk on.
NICK
It's your choice. Life with me and
the dog you love. Or a pet-free
existence with a shallow,
egotistical poet.
32.
Sheeni ponders this.
SHEENI
OK, Nick, I guess I don't have any
choice. I'll break up with Trent.
But if he kills himself it's on
your conscience.
NICK
I accept full responsibility.
SHEENI
Well, good, that's settled.
NICK
Not quite, darling. I want one more
thing.
SHEENI
What?
NICK
What do you think?
A beat. Sheeni looks pensive. It fades to amusement.
SHEENI
Do you have a condom?
Nick lifts his eyebrows. Now we're getting somewhere!
SHEENI
It has to be in a safe place. A
nice comfortable bed. With no
threat of interruptions. And for
relaxation and mood setting some
good red wine, preferably French. I
want a new condom. Not one that's
been riding around in your wallet
for years. Consumers rated them a
while back. I suggest you get their
top-rated brand. This may take some
research in the library. I'd
appreciate a photocopy of the
article. Plus, for supplementary
protection, I want a name brand
spermicide.
NICK
How about I have a quick vasectomy
just to be on the safe side?
SHEENI
(matter of fact)
Well, Nick, that, of course, is up
to you.
33.
Nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didn't register.
Nick gets into the back seat with Albert. The dog whimpers.
Sheeni stands off to the side, waving at them both.
JERRY
Okay. Back to civilization!
He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust. Albert
slobbers all over Nick.
Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror,
waving in the road.
NICK (V.O.)
I have a tall mountain to climb,
with many treacherous glaciers
still to cross, but finally, I have
obtained a stamped entry visa to
the paradise that lay beyond.
Sheeni watches the Lincoln and trailer recede toward the
horizon.
NICK (V.O.)
In short... I have a very real
prospect for getting laid.
FADE TO BLACK.
34.
Jerry joins Nick and Estelle in the doorway. There in the
living room, surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly
against the walls, is Jerry's camouflaged Chevy.
NICK
I guess they didn't cave after all.
Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle.
JERRY
Boy, everything's complete. There's
even water in the windshield
washer.
ESTELLE
How did they ever get it in here?
My front door can't be more than
three feet wide.
JERRY
Looks like they brought it in piece
by piece and then reassembled it.
ESTELLE
But it would take an army of
mechanics to do all that!
Jerry slams down the hood.
JERRY
Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy.
35.
Nick's door is ajar. Nick pulls up his trousers and comes
into the hall. He listens to the voices downstairs.
STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
He comes down the first few steps and is met with the sight
of his mother and sister staring up at him.
ESTELLE
Nick, your sister came all the way
from LA for a weekend visit!
Nick and Joanie meet eyes. She lifts a quizzical eyebrow.
NICK
Stellar.
Albert chews on Jerry's sock under the table.
JERRY
Can someone do something about the
mutt?
The family dines over take-out fried chicken. Jerry kicks
Albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor.
ESTELLE
I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do
something about the monstrosity
dripping oil in my living room?
JOANIE
Yeah, I noticed that. What's the
story?
NICK
Jerry tried to outsmart a few
sailors. It's been an amusing saga.
Jerry contemplates smacking Nick upside the head, but decides
against it when he discerns Estelle is probably in her son's
corner.
JERRY
OK, Babe, I guess when I come back
from my next haul I'll just have to
take it apart piece by piece.
36.
Estelle takes a deep breath and tries to let the matter rest.
JOANIE
Up to anything scandalous these
days, Nick?
NICK
I was going to ask you the same
thing.
JOANIE
What do you mean?
Nick puffs out his chest. Joanie looks down at her boob-job.
JOANIE
Not that it's any of your business,
but I've taken a class to improve
my posture.
Nick rolls his eyes.
ESTELLE
I think Joanie looks very nice. And
she has a new boyfriend too.
NICK
Did you meet him in posture class?
ESTELLE
Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah.
JOANIE
Really now? Are you on each others'
Myspace pages?
NICK
Hardly. Sheeni believes the
internet will be the end of
literacy.
JOANIE
So it's to be a torturous snail
mail exchange, huh?
NICK
More like the occassional collect
call.
ESTELLE
Collect calls? And just who do you
expect to pay for that?
Jerry kicks the dog away from his sock. Albert growls and
prepares for another charge.
37.
JERRY
Hey, Nick. Want to learn how a car
is put together?
NICK
No, thanks. Auto mechanics doesn't
interest me.
JERRY
See, Estelle, I told you the kid
was queer-eeAAAAHHHHH!
Jerry lurches backward in the chair and lands on the floor,
revealing that Albert's teeth have a firm grasp on Jerry's
sack. The dog shakes the scrotum in his jaws.
JERRY
Damn it! The dog!
He tries to swipe Albert with his beer bottle, but the dog
retreats into the house, leaving Jerry rolling around on the
floor.
Joanie and Nick exchange a smile. The phone rings. Estelle
gets up to answer it.
ESTELLE
Nick, put the dog in the basement.
Nick stoops to secure the leash around the piping. He regards
the little pug. Albert WHIMPERS and cocks his head.
The door at the top of the stairs opens and Estelle descends
the first few steps.
ESTELLE
Nick, that was your father on the
phone. He lost his job.
NICK
How unlike him.
ESTELLE
Watch your smart mouth. This means
the end of child support.
NICK
Which means...
ESTELLE
You'll have to start going to...
(DISTORTED)
Oakland Public School.
In Nick's eyes the fear of a sentence worse than death.
38.
Morning comes through the drapes. The phone on the side table
is ringing. Nick emerges from his room and picks it up.
NICK
Hello?
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Will you accept a collect call from
Sheeni Saunders?
NICK
Absolutely.
Nick looks around, opens the door to the linen closet and
darts inside.
BLACKNESS. Then Nick pulls the cord and the naked bulb kicks
on.
SHEENI (V.O.)
Nick?
NICK
Sheeni? How are you?
SHEENI (V.O.)
I'm well, Nickie.
NICK
And how is Trent? Not too suicidal
I hope.
Sheeni relaxes on a love seat, cradling the phone with her
shoulder as she eats grapes from a bowl. WE INTERCUT.
SHEENI
Of course, he was disconsolate, but
we talked all day and he's come to
see this as an opportunity for
growth. Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted
me to tell you that he bears you no
ill will.
NICK
Nor I him. I wish him all the best.
SHEENI
His parents are sending him to a
French speaking boarding school
this year. He's sure to get along
there. So how is my darling Albert?
39.
NICK
Well, though he's taken a disliking
to Jerry.
SHEENI
And you, Nickie? How are you?
NICK
I regret, Love of My Life, my
father has lost his job and I will
now be forced to go to public
school.
SHEENI
How unfortunate. What did he do?
NICK
He's a writer - sort of. He writes
advertising copy.
SHEENI
Really?
(pensive beat)
Nick, I suggest we look at your
father's firing as a blessing in
disguise.
NICK
How so?
SHEENI
I propose we get your father a job
here in Ukiah and you can come and
live with him.
NICK
Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of
Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage
culvert to be with you.
SHEENI
Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know
Progressive Plywood is looking for
an assistant editor. It would be
perfect for your father.
Nick furrows his brow with skepticism.
NICK
I had no idea you had knowledge of
the employment opportunities of
trade magazines.
SHEENI
The owner is the father of a friend
of mine.
40.
NICK
Anyone I know?
SHEENI
Okay, it's Trent's father. So what?
NICK
So why would Trent want to help my
father move to Ukiah?
SHEENI
I told you, darling. Trent harbors
you no ill will. I will have him
call your father up pretending to
be a head hunter.
NICK
Very well, but I don't see how I am
to live with him. My mother values
my indentured servitude.
SHEENI
You must influence her to send you
away. I feel this will require
being in a constant state of open
revolt on your part.
NICK
What do you want me to do?
SHEENI
I propose you rent the film Rebel
Without a Cause as soon as
possible. You must emulate James
Dean...
CLOSE ON her GLOSSY LIPS.
SHEENI
...You must be bad, Nickie. Be
very, very bad.
A glint of resolve in Nick's eyes.
NICK
I will, darling. I will!
And in pre-lap comes the DING DONG of the doorbell.
Joanie and Nick sit in the Chevy Nova watching Rebel Without
a Cause through the windshield.
41.
Estelle enters the living room with tears streaming down her
face and a police officer, LANCE WESCOTT, 45, with a flattop,
watery red eyes, and assorted guns, flashlights, and billy
clubs.
ESTELLE
Kids? This is Officer Lance
Wescott. He has some bad news.
After a beat, Nick rolls down the window.
LANCE
Your mother's friend Jerry had a
heart attack in a bar in Dallas.
He's dead.
Estelle sobs, but isn't joined by her children. She turns to
Lance.
ESTELLE
Will they be sending his
belongings?
LANCE
Uh... I'm afraid they've already
been sent. To his wife.
Beat. Nick looks to Joanie. They both look to their mother.
ESTELLE
His... His wife?!?
She bursts into tears and collapses into Officer Lance
Wescott's arms.
LANCE
There, there, Ma'am. It's going to
be okay.
Nick watches his mother sobbing against the cop's chest for a
beat before he rolls up the window and he and Joanie resume
watching the movie.
Estelle's cries of despair become...
....the cries of ecstasy coming through the wall along with
the repeated exclamation of Lance's name.
Nick rolls over in bed. Bloodshot eyes. He hauls himself out
of bed.
NICK (V.O.)
I have decided to create a
supplementary persona named
Franois.
42.
He stands in front of the mirror and leans in.
NICK (V.O.)
Like a Parisian James Dean, he will
be bold, reckless, contemptuous of
authority, and irresistible to
women.
PUSH IN on his reflection, as a moustache appears. Then a
beret and black and white striped shirt. Then a cigarette
holder and Thompson machine-gun. And FRANOIS is born.
NICK
Hello, Franois. I think you'll do
nicely.
FRANOIS
Oui, I am ze perfect match pour une
Francophile for ze likes of Sheeni
Saunders. I have ze calculating
intelligence...
NICK
...the itchy trigger finger...
Franois cocks the machine-gun.
NICK
FRANOIS
...and cojone grandes!
...and cojone grandes!
Nick opens the door. Lance and Estelle shower behind the
frosted glass.
NICK
Damn! Those hippos are taking a
shower together. How repulsive!
He slams the door.
Nick comes down the stairs. He reaches the water heater and
starts spinning the knob.
The forms of Estelle and Lance in the shower can be made out.
They both start screaming as they are blasted with cold
water. The blobs of their bodies press up against the glass.
43.
Albert looks up at Nick and lets out a BARK. Nick smiles and
bends down to undo his leash.
Lance bursts from the bathroom in his boxers, looking for
blood. He hears the sound of paws climbing the stairs. Albert
comes hurtling around he corner, almost losing his footing on
the hardwood floor.
ALBERT'S POV
as we lunge at Lance's crotch.
Estelle hands Lance an ice-pack and he applies it to his
injury. Nick wanders in and takes his seat at the table.
NICK
Where's Joanie?
ESTELLE
She's sleeping in.
NICK
No doubt. I don't think anyone got
a wink last night with all that
racket.
Lance looks at him, seething inwardly. He glances to Estelle.
NICK
I thought there were laws in this
city against illicit cohabitation.
Or are they just another big
policeman's joke?
LANCE
Kid, you are asking for trouble.
NICK
What are you going to do? Shoot me
with your gun?
Lance lunges across the table.
ESTELLE
No, Lance! Nickie, go to your room.
Nick flings down his napkin and heads for the front door.
44.
ESTELLE
Where do you think you're going?
NICK
Out!
The screen door slams behind him.
The garage door rattles upward, illuminating the cardboard
box of paint supplies. Nick bends down and picks up a can of
aerosol spray-paint. He shakes it.
A knock on the door. Lefty enters the room and Nick pulls the
headphones off his ears.
NICK
Hey, Lefty.
LEFTY
What's with your mom, Nick? She
gave me the third degree just to
come up here.
NICK
I vandalized Jerry's trailer and
she found my picture of Lacey.
LEFTY
Well, good thing I stole this from
the bookstore then.
Lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound
volume titled Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.
LEFTY
I was reading it all last night.
Boy, having sex is a lot more
complicated than I thought. Did you
know you were supposed to stick
your pinkie in her bumhole?
NICK
You lie.
LEFTY
No way, man. Here, I got the page
marked.
Lefty flops down on the sofa next to Nick and the two of them
flip through the manual.
NICK
Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try
this on Sheeni. I think this book
is for people who've been married
so long they're disgusted by the
sight of each other.
They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in
various states of foreplay.
47.
LEFTY
Are we really supposed to be
that... uh... big?
NICK
I think these illustrations are
disproportionate for emphasis.
LEFTY
Maybe we should compare.
NICK
Perhaps we should. Just for the
sake of research.
Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each
other like a pair of duelists. They simultaneously undo their
belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet.
They straighten. Lefty's eyes fall to Nick's crotch. He gets
a hint of concern in his expression.
Nick stares at Lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for
the curvature.
The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nick's
lunch. She lets out a scream. The boys turn to face her,
pants around their ankles.
ESTELLE
PERVERTS!
She hurls the tray of food at them. Lefty bolts. Nick hastily
tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around
the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way.
ESTELLE
FRIGGIN' GODDAMN PERVERTS!
Lefty emerges from the room and takes off.
ESTELLE
You won't get away! I'm calling
your parents! PERVERTS!
Nick bursts from the room, desperately trying to buckle his
pants. Estelle is hot on his heels, wielding the hardbound
sex manual as they round the bannister.
ESTELLE
In my house! How dare you!
She catches up to Nick at the top of the stairs and cracks
him upside the head.
48.
He loses his balance and goes tumbling down the staircase,
letting out a moan that stutters as his head hits each step.
He comes crashing into the foyer, landing on the slate.
Nick watches out the window.
Estelle can be seen animatedly describing the events to
LEFTY'S PARENTS. Lefty glances up at Nick and gives a pained
expression.
Nick lays on his belly reading No Exit. He looks up when he
hears the sound of footsteps in the hall. Shadows appear
beneath the crack in the door.
Estelle opens the door and looks down at him.
ESTELLE
Nick, I just want you to know that
I've thought about it, and I've
accepted that you are gay.
NICK
Thanks a pantsful, but I'm not gay.
If you're really concerned though,
I suggest you get me a room at the
Ukiah Motel 6. If anyone can
straighten me out, it's Sheeni.
She looks at him dubiously and hands out the phone.
ESTELLE
That sounds more like a job for
your father. Here, he wants to talk
to you.
Nick takes the phone from her hands and she closes the door.
NICK
(into phone)
Hello?
GEORGE
So what's this I hear about you
being gay?
George sprawls on the couch, cradling the phone with one
hand, and holding a beer on his stomach with the other. WE
INTERCUT.
49.
NICK
What's this I hear about you being
unemployed?
GEORGE
Yes, but my condition is only
temporary. I can change it.
NICK
I hope you do. We need the money.
GEORGE
Nick, there are more important
things in life than money.
NICK
I know, Dad. Like getting a good
education. And being able to
respect your parents.
GEORGE
I've got two words for you. Safe
sex.
NICK
Thanks, Dad.
He hangs up the phone.
Nick pushes past a fight where two kids throw each other
against the lockers. He smiles at a pair of PUNK ROCK GIRLS.
One of them flips him off. Nick heads into...
And as Nick steps into the bathroom, we follow his eyes...
SWISH TO... a CRIP selling a bag of dope to a GOTH FRESHMAN.
SWISH TO... a LATIN KING vandalizing the wall with the words
LATIN KINGS WERE HERE.
SWISH TO... a pack of WIGGERS as one of them gives the others
a butterfly knife show-and-tell.
50.
WE DRIFT down the corridor where Nick dials at a pay phone.
FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)
Office of Child Welfare.
NICK
Hello, uh... My name is Nick. Nick
Twisp. My father's name is George
Twisp.
FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)
Has he hit you, Nick?
NICK
Not lately. But he's missed several
child support payments, and is not
looking for work. So now I'm going
to public school in Oakland.
FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)
Not the Oakland schools!
NICK
Yes. And he's had an offer from a
respectable publication in Ukiah.
FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)
Don't you worry, young man. I'll
get right on this. Don't worry.
We'll light a fire under that
deadbeat!
Nick hunches over his desk doing homework, headphones over
his ears. Estelle knocks and enters. Nick pulls the
headphones down around his neck.
ESTELLE
Lance and I are walking down to the
movie theater. There's TV dinners
in the freezer. Oh, and Nick - your
father got a job in Ukiah.
NICK
Mom? Do you think it might be a
good idea if I moved in with him?
ESTELLE
Nick, that just wouldn't work. I
depend on that child support money
to eat.
NICK
But shouldn't you depend on the
child support money for, you
know... child support?
53.
ESTELLE
Watch your smart mouth.
She slams the door.
Nick cruises along sedately. He plays with the radio and
settles on the Sex Pistols.
He looks up just in time to see the red light and slams on
the brakes, nearly jack-knifing the trailer.
The light turns green and the car lumbers up the long hill.
54.
WE FOLLOW Nick as he comes through the front door and is met
with the sight of his mother and Lance staring at him from
the kitchen table.
The Berkeley fire rages on the television.
NICK
Hey, Mom! How was the movie?
LANCE
You little shit. You stole your
mother's dead ex-boyfriend's
trailer and set a five million
dollar fire.
NICK/FRANCOIS
I refuse to stand for such
allegations!
ESTELLE
Nick! They have a description of
the arsonist!
Lance flips through his notebook and reads.
LANCE
A white teenage male, about five-
seven. A hundred and twenty five
pounds, dark hair, spotted
complexion...
NICK
That could be anyone.
56.
LANCE
He was also wearing a tee shirt
with the words: I'm single, let's
mingle.
Nick glances down at the lettering on his shirt. Oops.
Estelle bursts into tears.
ESTELLE
What am I going to do? My only son
will be sent to prison!
Lance takes Estelle in his arms and smirks at Nick.
ESTELLE
Oh, Lance, can't something be done?
LANCE
Tell you what, Estelle. I'll make
out that Nick reported the car and
trailer stolen before the fire.
It'll be less suspicious. But I
could take some serious heat for
this.
ESTELLE
Oh, Lance! You're wonderful! How
can I possibly repay you?
LANCE
I'll think of something, Estelle.
He gives her ass a playful squeeze. She lets out a giggle.
LANCE
Now the kid better not be here when
the detectives start coming around.
I'd send him away for a while. A
long while.
ESTELLE
He can go make his father's life
miserable!
Nick suddenly brightens.
NICK
But I like it here.
ESTELLE
You're going, buster!
She snatches up the phone and dials. George's groggy voice
can be heard answering. Estelle screams into the phone.
57.
ESTELLE
You're son just burned down half of
Berkeley! Come and get the little
brat!
LANCE
Wait a minute, Estelle, aren't you
going to punish him? I'd say he
deserves a good hiding.
ESTELLE
(cupping the squawking
PHONE)
He's too much for me anymore. Can
you do it, Lance, darling?
Lance gives Nick another smirk.
Nick let's out a yelp of pain as Lance brings a broken tree
limb against his bare bottom. WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!
NICK (V.O.)
I don't scream much. I am making a
painful sacrifice for The Woman Of
My Dreams. My suffering possesses a
beauty which elevates it above this
sordid scene.
With the final blow the tree limb cracks in half. Nick looks
over his shoulder.
NICK
Are you through?
Lance looks around the room. Picks up an umbrella and
considers it in his hand. Nick hangs his head.
The BMW pulls into the drive of the house - a plywood
rectangle perched on cement blocks. Aluminum windows. A swamp
cooler on the shallow-pitched roof. They all emerge from the
car.
GEORGE
Go ahead and bring your stuff
inside. Lacey and I need a nap.
C'mon, Sugar Puss.
Nick watches longingly as George leads Lacey into the home.
As he places his hand on Lacey's ass, he looks back over his
shoulder and throws a smug look in Nick's direction.
NICK (V.O.)
What a competitive asshole.
Two WRESTLERS slam down onto the mat below us.
NICK (V.O.)
I do not have a friend within a
hundred miles. This is a daunting
thought if you think about it.
WE TRACK down the row of other students, starting with a
THREE HUNDRED POUND BEHEMOTH. The row seems to descend in
weight class, until we reach Nick at the very end.
CUT TO:
Nick does his best to not be pinned by DWAYNE CRAMPTON, who
out-weighs him by at least 40 pounds.
63.
Nick rinses off. Dwayne steps up to the shower head next to
his. Nick glances his way and quickly recoils at the
repelling landscape of rolling pink flab.
DWAYNE
Sorry `bout wompin' ya. I'm Dwayne.
NICK
Nick. Nick Twisp.
DWAYNE
Say, Nick? Why do you suppose guys
got only two testicles when we got
ten fingers and toes?
NICK
I could not begin to speculate.
Nick turns off his shower and slinks away.
An empty hallway. PSYCHEDELIC SOUND plays.
Nick comes around the corner, literally floating down the
hall. He breaststrokes through the air toward us.
He passes just under the door frame and comes down, feet
touching carpet. He looks into the mirror and finds Franois
lounging on the bed behind him.
NICK
My God, Franois! What was Paul
smoking?
FRANCOIS
Shut up and go with it.
Nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing
Lacey's lingerie.
Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. WE PAN
AROUND the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing
nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs.
He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E.
He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic
straps to fasten the bra onto his head.
He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys
rendition of BRAZIL in his head. Waving arms. Bicycling leg
movements.
65.
As he backs up we can see that George is watching him from
the doorway, a Safeway bag in his arms. Lacey peers over his
shoulder. The MUSIC halts abruptly.
GEORGE
What the... What the hell?
Nick gives a startled jump.
LACEY
Is..? Is that my bra?
Nick sits at the table, considerably more clothed and sober.
George works on a jug of zin.
GEORGE
We're calling that fruitcake
display strike one. Two more
strikes and it's back to Oakland.
Nick nods. The front door opens and MRS. CRAMPTON enters with
Safeway bags of her own. Dwayne follows close behind her.
DWAYNE
Hey, Nick!
Albert barks and jumps at Dwayne's feet.
NICK
Uh... Hi, Dwayne. What are you
doing here?
DWAYNE
Ain't ya heard. We're gonna be
roommates! Ain't that zinky?
Nick looks to his father in horror as Dwayne goes chasing
after the dog.
MRS. CRAMPTON
Dwayne, get yer dumb ass back here
and take yer sleepin' pill. You
must be Nick. Wash yer hands, boy.
I don't serve two shifts.
NICK
Uh... Dad? What's going on?
GEORGE
Mrs. Crampton's our new
housekeeper. I'm renting out the
spare room to her seeing as her
camper has been deemed unfit for
human habitation.
66.
NICK
What about Dwayne?
GEORGE
He's bunking with you.
NICK
Dad!
GEORGE
You working on strike two?
Nick leans back and glares in silent protest as everyone
takes their seats at the table.
Nick tries to shut out the sound of Dwayne getting into the
creaky bed behind him.
DWAYNE
Say, Nick. You wanna sleep in bed
with me? It'll be tons warmer.
NICK
No thank you, Dwayne.
A knock at the door. Lacey enters.
LACEY
This came for you, Nick.
Nick sits up in bed to receive the letter. As Lacey leaves,
he tears through the wax seal and unfolds its contents.
DWAYNE
Is it a love letter, Nick?
NICK
I don't know, it's in French. Say,
why does your mother give you
sleeping pills?
DWAYNE
`Cuz otherwise I'd stay up all
night playin' Nintendo Wii. Say,
Nick, can I walk Albert?
NICK
I don't know. Dogs don't grow on
trees.
DWAYNE
Pleeease, Nick?
67.
NICK
Okay. But it will cost you one
sleeping pill per walk.
DWAYNE
Whatchu want them pills for, Nick?
NICK
You never know when sedatives will
come in handy.
A rowdy cafeteria. Lefty and Nick dine in the corner. Nick
has an open French textbook as he tries to decipher Sheeni's
letter. An Indian boy, VIJAY JOSHI, 16, makes his way to
them.
VIJAY
May I sit at your table?
LEFTY
Sure. I'm Lefty and this is Nick.
VIJAY
I am Vijay Joshi.
Vijay sits and shakes their hands.
VIJAY
I see you both have been rejected
by the socially elite of our
school. Ukiah is a cultural
wasteland compared to India. Though
some of the girls are very
attractive.
NICK
Do you have a girlfriend?
VIJAY
Not at the moment. But I am
optimistic. How about you?
69.
NICK
Yes, but she transferred.
VIJAY
You don't mean Sheeni Saunders. I
heard she was interested in some
brilliant fellow in the Bay Area.
LEFTY
Hey, that's you, Nick.
VIJAY
I'm surprised. You are not at all
what I imagined.
Nick narrows his eyes.
VIJAY
So how is Sheeni?
NICK
I don't know. She sent me this
letter. But it's in French.
VIJAY
Shall I translate it for you?
NICK
You speak French?
VIJAY
I speak French, English, Hindi,
Marathi, and Urdu.
LEFTY
That must come in handy.
Nick hands over the letter and Vijay starts reading it
silently. He chuckles as he reads and Nick squints his eyes
at him in annoyance.
Vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud.
VIJAY
Dear, Nick...
In Nick's imagination, Sheeni puts pen to paper at her desk
which affords a view of the sun setting on the ocean.
SHEENI (V.O.)
...I am writing you from my room in
Santa Cruz. Surprisingly, boarding
school has proven to be a welcome
liberation as well as...
70.
SHEENI (V.O.)
...a stimulating experience which I
am now not so quick to change.
Sheeni slips into a nightgown as other GIRLS walk around
scantily clad behind her.
SHEENI
Perhaps you should consider
learning French and enrolling. That
said...
Sheeni chats up a gathering of HANDSOME BOYS in the hall.
They regard her lustfully.
SHEENI (V.O.)
...English cannot be spoken on
campus even if you are hemorrhaging
from an accidental limb amputation.
SHEENI (V.O.)
I have made friends with the head
of the girls' basketball team. Her
name is Heather, and despite her
popularity, she is saving herself
for college boys.
HEATHER, a slender giantess, poses with the other members of
the BASKETBALL TEAM for a yearbook photo.
SHEENI (V.O.)
I have an interesting roommate from
New York named Taggarty...
TAGGARTY, short dark hair, intense green eyes, Manhattan
sophistication cloaked in fragile ripeness, snaps a Polaroid
of a sleepy BOY.
SHEENI (V.O.)
She has already slept with
seventeen boys and hopes to rack up
fifty before leaving here.
Taggarty tacks the picture to a wall covered with Polaroids.
She writes the boy's grade (C-) beneath his image.
VIJAY
(READING)
All in all, I'm happy and look
forward to further growth in this
rich, intellectual environment.
Vijay sets down the letter. Nick waits a beat, staring in
disbelief.
NICK
That's it? Nothing else about me?
Vijay picks up the letter again.
VIJAY
Oh yes... Love to you and Albert.
(setting down the letter)
Who's Albert?
NICK
Albert is our dog. This is a
disaster. What the hell does she
mean Trent wants to mend the
relationship?
VIJAY
I don't know, but this Taggarty
girl sounds very uninhibited. I
wonder if she's made it with a
Hindu yet.
LEFTY
Heather sounds like a babe. You
think if I grew a beard I'd pass
for college age?
NICK
I've got to get to Sheeni as soon
as possible. If I don't Trent
Preston is going to mindfuck her
into thinking she doesn't like me.
72.
LEFTY
And then he'll probably fuck her in
other ways. Did you know you're
supposed to put your pinkie in a
girl's bumhole, Vijay?
NICK
Will you shut up and help me out?
LEFTY
Sorry, Nick. What should we do?
NICK
I suggest we steal my father's BMW
and take a trip to Santa Cruz.
Vijay, you'll have to be our
translator.
VIJAY
But what will we tell our parents?
LEFTY
You can tell your father you are
staying at Nick's house for the
weekend. And visa versa.
NICK
Good thinking.
VIJAY
But what if we are caught?
NICK
To hell with it, Vijay. It's time
to take action!
THREE CUTS. The JINGLE as Nick removes his Dad's keys from
the bureau. The trunk SLAMMING closed with the sleeping bags
inside. The ROAR of the engine as Vijay's hand turns the key
in the ignition.
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
As Vijay drives, Lefty holds up a road map in the back seat.
Nick places a CD in the stereo and TAKE FIVE fills the car.
LEFTY
What is this music, Nick?
NICK
It's Dave Brubeck.
(to Vijay)
I thought a person as cultured as
yourself would appreciate it.
73.
VIJAY
You want culture? I will give you
culture.
Vijay puts in his own CD and Ravi Shankar's TARANA blasts
from the speakers.
Nick gives Vijay a grin of approval. MUSIC PLAYS OVER...
An empty hall. The SNEAKY STRINGS of NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN.
Sheeni rounds the corner at the far end. As she and Heather
sneak the boys down, the other OCCUPANTS of the floor giggle
in French and dart from door to door in near-undress.
A cement cubicle just big enough for a bunk bed, two small
desks, an army surplus dresser, and a stuffed armchair.
Sheeni pulls a nightgown from the dresser.
HEATHER
Lefty, should maybe sleep in my
room. It's pretty crowded in here.
LEFTY
Your roommate won't mind?
HEATHER
Oh, Darlene went home for the
weekend.
Lefty gulps and picks up his grip. He pauses in the hallway.
LEFTY
Well, see you guys in the morning.
The door closes and Vijay and Nick exchange a knowing glance.
SHEENI
Pardon me, everyone.
Sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change. Vijay and Nick
regard the...
WALL OF TAGGARTY'S CONQUESTS
a series of mug shots of sullen-looking TEENAGE BOYS. Most of
them have been given a grade of C- or below.
75.
NICK
There's your competition.
VIJAY
A distinguished group I would be
happy to join.
The two boys turn around and watch in hot-blooded bliss as
Taggarty searches for her misplaced nightie.
The two boys brush their pearlies over the grungy sink.
VIJAY
I am in a state of sexual frenzy.
What is your plan?
NICK
We drape a blanket over the lower
bunk for Sheeni and me. You tackle
Taggarty on the top bunk. Here's a
condom. I slipped two to Lefty,
leaving us with four.
VIJAY
What if they don't go for it?
NICK
They'll go for it. You can cut the
sexual tension in that room with a
knife.
SHEENI
Don't be silly, darling. Not with
others in the room.
(leaning in to whisper)
We must wait until everyone falls
asleep.
Nick tries to appear unconcerned. She gives him a kiss and
climbs into her narrow bed.
As Nick and Vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor,
they watch Taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky.
TAGGERTY
Goodnight boys. Do you need the
light on to take off your clothes?
NICK
No.
(flipping off the light)
We can find our zippers in the
dark.
76.
A beat of BLACKNESS. Then a light tap at the door.
There is the sound of Sheeni getting out of bed. She cracks
the door, letting in just enough light from the hall that a
MALE SHADOW gets cast across the two boys on the floor.
Nick squints and tries to hear what Sheeni and the male
shadow are whispering to each other.
After a beat, Sheeni closes the door and the room plunges
into BLACKNESS once again. Nick listens as Sheeni climbs back
into bed as if nothing happened.
NICK
Sheeni?
SHEENI
Yes, Nick?
NICK
Was that the matron?
SHEENI
No.
Beat.
NICK
Then who was it?
SHEENI
It was Trent.
Beat.
NICK
Did you say it was Trent?
SHEENI
Yes. He came to discuss our
friendship. I told him now was not
the time.
NICK
So where is Trent now?
SHEENI
I assume he went back to the boys'
dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are
keeping everyone awake with your
inquiries.
Though silence follows, we take a moment to allow Nick's mind
to race in the dark. He stands and looks at the mirror above
the dresser. Franois can be made out sitting by the window
in the moonlight, stroking the Thompson.
77.
FRANOIS
Now is our chance.
NICK
Chance for what?
FRANOIS
To confront our nemesis. We must go
to the boys' dorm and kill Trent
where he sleeps.
NICK
I suppose we should at least get a
look at him. To see what we're
dealing with.
FRANOIS
Very well.
(stubbing out his
CIGARETTE)
You see what we are dealing with...
and zen I wll deal wiz it.
And with that he cocks the Thompson for dramatic flare.
Nick emerges from the room in nothing but his underwear and a
whindbreaker. He creeps down the hall.
Nick makes his way down the hall, checking the names on the
colored paper cut-out shapes that adorn the doors.
He stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts
the names TRENT and ED.
Nick knocks on the door.
It opens inward to reveal a bare-chested, hulking athlete in
a pajama pants. This is ED SOLOMON.
NICK
Trent?
ED
No. Who the hell are you?
78.
NICK
I am Nick Twisp.
ED
Oh, so you're Nick.
NICK
Is Trent here?
ED
You just missed him, Nick. He just
grabbed a couple condoms and left.
NICK
Did he say where he was going?
ED
I think he said he was going to
Heather's room.
NICK
But that's where Lefty is. Who are
you?
ED
Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent's roommate.
NICK
Oh, so you're Ed.
ED
What's that supposed to mean?
NICK
Nothing. It's just that Sheeni
mentioned Trent has a thing for a
guy named Ed, and that he touches
the guy when he falls asleep. But
obviously if that were you, you'd
know about it. Must be a different
Ed Solomon. Take care now.
Nick takes off running and Ed stares after him.
Nick bangs on the door. Heather answers in little more than a
G-string and Nick seems to forget his mission just long
enough to appreciate her body.
HEATHER
What's up, Nick?
NICK
Is Trent in there?
HEATHER
Not anymore.
NICK
What happened to Lefty?
LEFTY (O.S.)
I'm right here, Nick.
Nick peers past Heather where he finds Lefty standing naked
in the moonlight.
HEATHER
Trent was here, but he left. He
only dropped by to lend us a couple
more condoms.
NICK
But I gave Lefty two already.
HEATHER
Yes, and that was very generous of
you, but the night is young.
NICK
So what is Trent, the fucking
condom faerie!?!
LEFTY
You can have one of ours, Nick. If
you need one.
The fact that Nick doesn't yet raises his temperament even
further.
NICK
So where did he say he was going?
HEATHER
He didn't say, but I'm pretty sure
I just saw him go into our bathroom
down the hall.
80.
NICK
Thanks. Oh, and I'd be careful with
those condoms. Trent's roommate Ed
said that Trent pokes holes in them
so that he can get Sheeni pregnant
and be with her forever.
And with that piece of disturbing info, he leaves them.
There is the CLAP of thunder outside as Nick throws open the
door to the girls' bathroom. He looks around with murderous
rage.
There comes the sound of someone vomiting.
Nick kicks in the stall and finds BERNICE LYNCH, 17, a thin
platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe. She hurls
into the toilet again and turns around to find Nick.
BERNICE
Who are you?
NICK
I'm Sheeni's friend, Nick. Sorry to
disturb you.
BERNICE
That's OK. It was something I ate.
So wait, are you Sheeni's
boyfriend?
NICK
Uh, yeah.
BERNICE
My name's Bernice. Bernice Lynch.
Not that you asked.
NICK
Nice to meet you Bernice. Actually,
I think Trent Preston mentioned
you. He said you were frumpy, but
now that I've met you, I can see
Trent is a lying bastard.
BERNICE
Thanks. And Trent can go to hell
for all I care. Sheeni too.
NICK
You don't like Sheeni?
81.
BERNICE
Personally, I hate her guts. Well,
pardon me, Nick. I feel like
throwing up some more now.
NICK
You didn't happen to see Trent
Preston did you?
She waves him away as she bends over the sink to hurl again.
Then lifts her face and smiles through the dripping bile.
BERNICE
I did actually. I think he was on
his way to Sheeni's room.
Nick's eyes widen in alarm.
Nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking.
Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk.
He watches the moon lit forms thumping together.
He turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom
bunk. He moves toward her.
She blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him.
NICK
Sheeni?
SHEENI
Yes, darling.
NICK
Was Trent here?
SHEENI
Yes, Nick.
Nick hangs his head.
SHEENI
But I sent him away again.
Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he
finds nothing but adoration.
SHEENI
Because I want you, darling. Not
even Trent can match the
industriousness and tenacity with
which you have pursued me.
82.
She smiles. Nick smiles too. She reaches out to pull him into
her bed as...
The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit
by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight.
MATRON
Q'est que c'est passer ici?!?
Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk.
He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... Trent
standing behind the matron. The blinding light makes his
features difficult to make out but his white teeth are
definitely smiling diabolically.
Wally and Estelle watch the three semi-clothed boys shovel in
fried liver with no complaint.
ESTELLE
Wally was a friend of Jerry's. He
came to help me in my time of
mourning.
85.
NICK
What happened to Lance?
Estelle's face registers "none of your business," but a kind
look from Wally and she softens.
ESTELLE
Lance is busy training to be a
detective. He isn't around as much
as he used to be.
Nick nods and goes back to eating.
ESTELLE
Mr. Rumpkin is very smart. Ask him
a question, Nick.
NICK
Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous
actress was married to Frank
Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey
Rooney?
LEFTY
Whoever she is, she sure gets
around.
WALLY
Ava Gardner.
Estelle smiles with pride. Nick and the other boys regard the
gentle giant with admiration. He bashfully averts his eyes.
ESTELLE
That's nothing. You should see what
he did with the living room.
Nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway.
Where once the Chevy occupied the space, the living room was
now fairly returned to it's normal uncluttered state with all
the furniture placed back in the original positions.
At some point Wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared
by the living and dining areas because the Chevy now occupies
that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it has
achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall.
Estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch.
ESTELLE
Go ahead, Wally. Show them.
Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights
come on, giving the living room a warm, flattering glow.
86.
NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY
Ooooooh.
Wally flips another switch and the car's radio turns on.
NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY
Aaaaaaah.
Wally makes a slightly embarrassed gesture of scratching his
head before lumbering over to the couch and taking a seat
next to Estelle.
Nick watches as Wally puts his arm around his mother and they
listen to the Chevy play them Elvis' LOVE ME TENDER.
The two adults snuggle in the glow of the tail lights and it
brings an unexpected rush of caring in his expression.
Lacey works up a sweat to Billy Blank. Nick comes through the
door. He's still in his underwear.
NICK
Where's Dad?
LACEY
In the bedroom. I wouldn't bother
him, Nick. He's in a foul mood.
He's on with the police. Apparently
someone broke in and stole his
Beamer.
Lacey gives Nick an amused smile.
GEORGE (O.S.)
Lacey! Get in here!
87.
Lacey rolls her eyes and heads for the bedroom. Nick sits
down with Dwayne at the breakfast table.
DWAYNE
Nick, you got a girlfriend?
NICK
Yes, I do.
DWAYNE
If you asked your girlfriend as a
favor, would she do it with me?
NICK
Guys don't share their girlfriends.
DWAYNE
I get ya. You're worried `cause
your girlfriend might get knocked
up. What if I pull out, Nick?
Nick seethes inwardly. There comes a ruckus from the back
bedroom and Lacey emerges.
LACEY
It's not my fault, you tight-assed,
critical, nonfeeling, sexist drunk.
GEORGE (O.S.)
Sticks and stones. It doesn't
bother me if you sleep on the couch
from now on.
LACEY
Does it bother you that you're a
selfish, uptight, boring lover?
NICK
You forgot lousy driver!
George appears in the doorway.
GEORGE
That's strike two, jerkoff!
Nick hangs his head. George moves about the kitchen chugging
from a jug of zin. Lacey picks up the ringing phone.
LACEY
Hello?
(PAUSE)
Thank you.
Lacey hangs up the phone.
88.
LACEY
They found your car in Davenport,
George. Go pick it up.
GEORGE
Look who's wearing the pants this
morning.
Lacey takes a seat next to Nick and sighs.
LACEY
Nick, I feel for you. It must be
tough being a teenager in this
house.
NICK
My mother wasn't any better.
LACEY
Your mom has had a difficult time.
She has had a great deal to put up
with. I'm starting to appreciate
that now.
GEORGE
Are you by any chance referring to
me?
LACEY
If the shoe fits, suck on it.
George swills some zin and mumbles ominously.
GEORGE
We'll see who's sucking on what
soon.
VIJAY
I spoke with Taggarty this morning.
She requested a wallet sized photo.
Nick looks up glumly from his lunch. Lefty has his feet up on
the table, his facial growth is almost respectable.
LEFTY
Congratulations, Vijay. That makes
it official. Welcome to the club.
Nick narrows his eyes at the two non-virgins.
NICK
What grade did you receive?
89.
VIJAY
A C+. Which I feel is perfectly
satisfactory given the conditions.
LEFTY
I guess this means they're not
being expelled.
VIJAY
No, apparently they convinced the
matron it was all quite innocent.
NICK
Are you kidding? She had her
flashlight trained on your Hindi
boner!
A beat. Lefty and Vijay seem taken aback by the outburst.
VIJAY
No need to be jealous, Nick.
Nick stands and collects his lunch tray.
NICK (V.O.)
If I'm to get Sheeni expelled and
sent back to me I will need a
partner in crime.
Nick enters the computer lab and finds an open machine.
NICK (V.O.)
Luckily, Franois has a girl on the
inside.
Nick begins typing and speaking out loud.
NICK
Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting
you this weekend in the bathroom.
Bernice reads the letter.
NICK (V.O.)
I just want you to know I now see
why you loath Sheeni Saunders so
strongly.
Sheeni, Taggarty, and Heather sit across from the HEADMASTER
as the matron describes the events.
90.
NICK (V.O.)
I too have come to despise the
snooty, pretentious brunette and in
all honesty you should probably get
her expelled. I am happy to help in
that regard.
NICK (V.O.)
I have included a number of
sleeping pills with this note.
Bernice dumps the pills from the envelope.
NICK (V.O.)
You must introduce one of these
into her breakfast beverage each
day.
Bernice sits next to Sheeni, despite the fact she's being
ignored. Bernice drops a pill into Sheeni's coffee
nonchalantly.
Sheeni watches the INSTRUCTOR.
NICK (V.O.)
She may be intelligent, but she is
not likely to pass her courses when
she's falling asleep in class.
Sheeni's head slips off her hand as she drifts off. We MOVE
across the classroom to where Bernice scribbles in her
notebook.
NICK (V.O.)
Since meeting you, I have come to
realize my interest in Sheeni was
only a transient adolescent
infatuation. I like you more than I
can say. Take courage. Together we
will outsmart these cake eaters.
A view of the notebook shows her to be scribbling Nick's name
with hearts. She flips through pages of obsession.
Nick's fingers fly across the keys. He looks pleased with
himself.
NICK (V.O.)
Affectionately yours, Nick.
91.
He looks around for observers, looks back at the screen
pensively, and resumes typing.
NICK (V.O.)
P.S. Please destroy this note
immediately.
ON A MAILBOX
As Nick deposits his letter.
...where he comes upon the sight of Paul giving Lacey a foot
message on the couch.
NICK
Where's Dad?
LACEY
(DREAMILY)
Daddy is in Davenport. Where you
left his car.
PAUL
We saved you some mushrooms, Nick.
Nick watches the sensual foot message. He picks up the bag
full of mushrooms and considers them.
Nick pukes his guts into the sink.
Nick's in bed reading Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.
He glances up at Dwayne playing Nintendo and scowls.
There comes the strange warbled sound of a TRUMPET from the
next room, and it is joined by other instruments until we
hear The Nutley Brass' rendition of I WANT TO BE SEDATED.
Nick furrows his eyebrows in confusion.
ON THE BOOK
as the nude figures suddenly BECOME ANIMATED, making
wonderful love.
Nick follows them with his eyes as they float off the page.
92.
WE FOLLOW Nick as he follows the nude figures who do
acrobatics down...
THE HALL
and into...
THE LIVING ROOM
where Lacey watches Paul blow on his trumpet.
Nick marvels. The phone rings.
LACEY
Nick? Get the phone?
Nick picks up the phone and Paul takes his place at Lacey's
feet.
NICK
(into phone)
Hello?
I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT
George cradles the cell phone. WE INTERCUT.
GEORGE
Nick? Is that you?
NICK
I am Nick Twisp. I am alive. I am a
breathing organism.
GEORGE
Quit fooling around, Nick. This is
your dad. Is everything okay there?
NICK
Don't be afraid, Dad. Everything
will be okay. You deserve to be
loved.
GEORGE
What the hell is that supposed to
mean? Is Lacey there?
NICK
Lacey is here. Paul is caressing
her toes.
GEORGE
Paul! Who the hell is Paul?
93.
NICK
Paul is our friend. He makes
beautiful music for the acrobats.
They're naked.
GEORGE
Who's naked? Is Lacey naked?
NICK
Don't be afraid, Dad. Goodbye.
He hangs up the phone and pulls out the cord.
He joins Paul in working Lacey's feet.
NICK
Dad is afraid.
LACEY
He is on the wrong path. I have
felt that for some time.
Nick watches the headlights from the arriving BMW travel
across the walls.
They go out. He listens to the front door being keyed
followed by his father bellowing.
Nick gets up and wanders into...
LIVING ROOM
where Paul stands between George and Lacey.
PAUL
Okay, George, just calm down.
George lunges and Paul socks him in the eye, dropping him to
the floor.
GEORGE
You are in serious trouble. You've
assaulted me and I know for a fact
that you two were having naked
orgies with my son. That child is
only twelve years old.
George gets to his feet.
NICK
I'm sixteen, Dad.
94.
GEORGE
Shut your pie hole!
(turning to Lacey and
PAUL)
That boy is an underaged minor. I'm
going to have you arrested and
charged with child molesting.
LACEY
Don't be an idiot, George. No one
was naked.
GEORGE
When you get out of prison, you
will both have to register as sex
offenders. You will never be able
to get a decent job again.
PAUL
I've never had a decent job. I
don't think I'd want one.
LACEY
Let's go, Paul. George, I'll pick
up the rest of my things tomorrow.
GEORGE
Not until you pay me the rest of
the money you owe.
LACEY
I paid you all your money!
GEORGE
Not the extra charges.
She gets up in his face.
LACEY
Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges.
As Lacey and Paul depart, Nick turns and dreamily wanders
back toward his room.
GEORGE (O.S.)
Using bad language in front of a
minor. The judge will hear about
that too.
Nick gets back into his room and closes the door behind him.
SWISH TO... Dwayne playing Nintendo naked. He looks over his
shoulder.
DWAYNE
What's all the ruckus about?
95.
NICK
Dwayne! Please cover yourself.
DWAYNE
You wanna play Nintendo all night?
NICK
Of course not. I'm tired. Let's go
to sleep.
Nick unplugs the Nintendo and climbs into bed. Dwayne just
sits there on the floor, naked as a clam.
NICK (V.O.)
A strange night. I dreamed of
wrestling for what seemed like
hours with an amorous walrus...
Nick squirms with an amorphous blob, they wrestle against the
red abstract background.
Nick's bleary eyes snap open and wander to the floor, where
his pajamas lie in a crumpled pile.
NICK (V.O.)
There is only one explanation: I
have been Dwayned.
A pillow whacks across a blubbery face.
NICK
Wake up! I know what you were doing
last night, you disgusting beast!
DWAYNE
Don't be mad, Nick. I like you.
Dwayne throws off his sheets. Nick shudders at the sight.
...which is when Mrs. Crampton barges in..
MRS. CRAMPTON
Boys, time to get-- AHH! Dwayne!
Where's yer pajamas?
DWAYNE
Nick made me take them off, Mom. He
took off his too.
MRS. CRAMPTON
You leave my son alone. Don't go
co'rupt him with yer nastiness!
96.
NICK
We weren't doing anything, Mrs.
Crampton. It was just hot last
night.
MRS. CRAMPTON
If you get hot, boys, open a
window. Don't go takin' off yer
pajamas. That's nasty.
Nick dials on the phone. Behind him, Dwayne eats breakfast,
cheerfully kicking his feet back and forth under the chair.
TAGGARTY (V.O.)
Bonjour.
NICK
Taggarty? It's Nick.
Taggarty's at her desk. Her thick rimmed glasses almost make
her look studious. WE INTERCUT.
TAGGARTY
Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to
talk to Sheeni.
NICK
If you please.
Taggarty crosses to the bunks, where Sheeni is curled up
among the sheets as if in some Renaissance portrait.
TAGGARTY
It's your would-be-lover.
Sheeni sleepily takes the phone.
SHEENI
Nick?
NICK
Hello, My Beloved. How are you?
SHEENI
Not so well. I have been afflicted
with some kind of chronic fatigue.
NICK
Perhaps you are home sick. You do
sound rather blue.
97.
SHEENI
I'm not home sick, Nick. In fact,
I'm not very happy with you.
NICK
Me? What did I do?
SHEENI
You know damn well, Nick. You've
been spreading rumors about Trent.
And he doesn't deserve it.
NICK
Doesn't deserve it!?! I'd have to
claim he has genital warts to sink
to his level.
SHEENI
Well, whatever you said to Ed
Solomon, it was enough to get him
to give Trent a black eye.
NICK
Sheeni, I just don't get it. This
guy has cock-blocked at every turn
and you're taking his side?!?
SHEENI
Cock-blocked?
(SIGHS)
We'll have to resume this another
time, Nick. It's been an
emotionally exhausting weekend. My
parents are in an uproar over Paul.
He's moved some floozie in with him
up in the studio over the garage.
NICK
Lacey's not a floozie.
SHEENI
Lacey? You know her?
NICK
Of course. She's my father's ex-
girlfriend. I think that might make
you my stepmother-in-law.
SHEENI
Nick. Don't be gross.
NICK
Sorry. At any rate, I'll let you
go. We'll have plenty of time to
settle this tomorrow.
98.
SHEENI
Tomorrow?
NICK
Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving. I'll be
coming for dinner, of course.
SHEENI
Don't even think it, Nick. You know
my parents don't approve of you.
NICK
I'm confident they will learn to
love me. After all, I'm practically
family.
SHEENI
Nick, you must dismiss this
Thanksgiving notion from your mind.
I remain firm on this issue.
Goodbye.
CLICK. Nick regards the phone defensively. He puts it down
and takes a seat at the table.
He glares at Dwayne as they eat breakfast. There comes a
knock at the front door.
NICK
Don't move, blubber boy, I'll get
it.
I/E. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY
A POLICE OFFICER stands on the steps. Nick goes wide eyed at
the sight of him and visibly slumps.
POLICE OFFICER
Is George Twisp in?
NICK
Uh, I'm pretty sure he's sleeping
off a hangover, Officer. Is he
under arrest?
POLICE OFFICER
Under arrest? No, I'm the officer
working the case of his stolen car.
NICK
Ah.
POLICE OFFICER
You can tell your pop that the CD
he found in his car is Ravi
Shankar.
99.
NICK
Excuse me?
POLICE OFFICER
Indian music. So we're a checkin'
the INS files, see if we can get
some prints that match. You
wouldn't know anyone who might have
stolen the car who listens to this
crap, would ya, son?
NICK
No, and I'm not sure I like the
implication. Ravi Shankar is
beloved by many Caucasian...
DWAYNE (O.S.)
What about Vijay Joshi?
Nick stands stiff as a board. The officer peers around him at
Dwayne sitting inside.
DWAYNE
I'm pretty sure he's Injun.
The officer makes a note.
POLICE OFFICER
(to himself)
Vijay Joshi. We'll look into it.
Thank you, boys.
Nick gives a weak smile and closes the door.
NICK (V.O.)
Mrs. Crampton complained to Dad
that I tried to corrupt the fat
pervert cohabitating with me.
A view of the thin birch walls. We come to rest on Nick,
shivering under an electric blanket. There's a blob of snot
on his upper-lip.
100.
NICK (V.O.)
No matter. Tomorrow I will be
reunited with My Everlasting Love.
And I will not be stopped. Not by
an outbreak of the plague, nor by a
cruel return of the ice-age. Not
even by the Gods themselves.
Nick showers.
Nick straightens his Garcia tie in the mirror. He applies
hair gel.
Nick examines the whitehead on his brow. He pinches and a
glob of puss smacks the mirror.
He emerges into the hall and dances with an invisible partner
into the...
LIVING ROOM
where the phone RINGS. He flips off the stereo with the
remote and snatches up the phone.
NICK
Twisp residence.
ESTELLE (V.O.)
Nick?
NICK
Oh. Hey, Mom. What's up?
ESTELLE (V.O.)
Nickie, I have some bad news!
Nick sighs.
NICK
Okay. I'm ready. What is it?
ESTELLE (V.O.)
I'm afraid Lance and Wally got into
a terrible row. He tried to arrest
Wally and Wally broke Lance's jaw.
101.
NICK
What's the bad news?
ESTELLE (V.O.)
The Berkeley police know you
started the fire. Lance told them
where you are.
Nick glances up and sees the black and white patrol car
pulling up outside.
ESTELLE (V.O.)
Nick, they're coming to arrest you!
He slams down the phone.
Lacey floats toward him and gives him a hug.
NICK
Happy Thanksgiving, Lacey.
She spots the sad flowers in his hand.
103.
LACEY
What interesting flowers, Nick. Who
are they for?
NICK
Uh, Mrs. Saunders.
Lacey leads him by the hand into the chintz-bedecked parlor.
Sheeni's larger-than-life father and 5,000 year old mother
sit cross-legged on the floor, running their hands over the
hooked rug.
LACEY
Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, you remember
Nick Twisp, don't you?
Mrs. Saunders coos and takes the flowers. Her husband squints
up at him.
MR. SAUNDERS
You are very, very tall.
PAUL
No he's not, Dad. He just appears
tall because you are on the floor.
MR. SAUNDERS
I can feel the floor pushing
against me. Can you feel it too,
tall youth?
Nick glances over at Mrs. Saunders who is now eating the
flowers.
LACEY
Paul served an appetizer earlier.
PAUL
Yes, it's a recipe I picked up in
the Southwest. Stuffed mushrooms.
Nick smiles with amusement.
TAGGERTY (O.S.)
Hello, Nick.
Taggarty makes her entrance down the stairs, cloaked in a
green cape.
TAGGERTY
How is the star-crossed persistent
lover?
She greets him with a casually intimate kiss.
104.
NICK
Okay, I guess. Where's Sheeni?
TAGGERTY
Upstairs, Nick. She saw you coming
and hid in her room.
Nick knocks and enters to find Sheeni sprawled on the bed
with a book.
NICK
Dinner is almost ready, My Love.
SHEENI
I do not intend to be party to my
brother's absurdities. He has
allowed you in and drugged my
parents.
NICK
I think they are deriving some good
from the experience.
Sheeni finally looks up from her book.
SHEENI
What are you doing here, Nick? I
expressly asked you not to come.
NICK
To hell with that. What do I have
to do to prove my love to you? My
friends have gotten laid and I'm
pretty sure neither one of them was
beaten with a tree trunk, raped by
a walrus, or had to contend with
the likes of Trent Preston!
SHEENI
You were raped by a walrus?
NICK
Sheeni, I have shown restraint, I
have committed crimes, I have
traveled to the lengths of the
state and still you won't give me
this one little thing.
SHEENI
Sex, Nick. Why don't you just say
it? That's what you want. You want
me to have sex with you.
105.
NICK
(BEAT)
Well... YEAH!
A beat as Nick's open admissions makes her consider his
point. She sighs and shakes her head.
SHEENI
How is my dog?
NICK
Excellent. He should be coming out
of the oven right about now.
She tosses the book at him, but he dodges it successfully.
SHEENI
I hate you, Nickie!
She stands up and tries to slap him. He grabs her wrists and
pulls her to him.
NICK
I hate you too.
They share a long, intense kiss.
They break away and she smiles in spite of herself.
The Saunders and extended family take their seats at the
polished mahogany table crammed with turkey, yams, mashed
potatoes, and cranberry sauce.
They all lower their heads and Lacey leads them in prayer.
LACEY
Dear Lord...
Mr. Saunders emits a long, low, fog horn of a fart that ends
badly.
The others exchange glances but he and his wife still have
their heads solemnly bowed.
LACEY
Dear Lord, thank you for this
bounty. Help us to be tolerant of
others - especially the boyfriends
and girlfriends of our immediate
relations. Amen.
EVERYONE
Amen.
106.
They begin eating. A helicopter passes by outside, search
light briefly coming through the windows.
Nick watches Mr. Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes
and apply it to his face like war paint.
MRS. SAUNDERS
Paul? Your father looks rather
strange.
PAUL
Well, mother, he is sitting in his
own bowel movement.
MRS. SAUNDERS
That's no excuse.
Another helicopter passes overhead.
TAGGARTY
The food is delicious, Paul.
PAUL
Thank you.
(BEAT)
Sister, darling, how long has it
been since we all observed the
rituals of Thanksgiving?
SHEENI
Not long enough, Paul.
NICK
I hope it's the first of many such
occasions for me.
Sheeni narrows her eyes at him.
A long beat as they all dine in silence. Then-
Mrs. Saunders croaks out in song.
MRS. SAUNDERS
Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/
Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright...
Paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others
accompany her as Mr. Saunders pretends to conduct them with a
drumstick.
EVERYONE
Round yon virgin Mother and Child/
Holy infant so tender and mild/
Sleep in heavenly peace... Sle-eep
in heavenly pee-eace.
107.
And with that, the doorbell rings. Taggarty gets up and opens
the door.
TAGGARTY
Oh, Trent, you made it.
Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his
entrance. He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but
rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous
features and a certain flamboyance. His black eye, courtesy
of Ed Solomon, still remains.
TRENT
Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone.
Mr. Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the
pitcher and pours water into his own lap.
SHEENI
Trent, darling, this is Nick.
Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes.
TRENT
Nick, at last we meet.
NICK
Hello, Trent.
TAGGARTY
Have a seat, Trent.
TRENT
I'm sorry, Taggarty, I can't stay.
I have bad news.
SHEENI
What is it?
TRENT
Bernice Lynch has tried to commit
suicide.
Sheeni and Taggarty gasp. Nick swallows hard.
TRENT
She swallowed a number of sleeping
pills, and is now in a coma.
SHEENI
The poor girl.
TRENT
There's more. Before I left school,
I searched her room.
108.
NICK
Did you obtain proper authorization
from the officials?
TRENT
No, Nick, I acted on my own
initiative. In Bernice's closet, I
found this letter.
He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket.
TRENT
In the letter, the writer
instructed Bernice to begin
sedating Sheeni with drugs he
himself supplied.
TAGGARTY
Nick, you didn't!
NICK
Well, you see...
SHEENI
Nick! You could have killed me!
MR. SAUNDERS
Who died?
TRENT
No one yet, Mr. Saunders.
Mrs. Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction.
MRS. SAUNDERS
ARREST HIM!
TRENT
I can't arrest him. But I have
called the Santa Cruz Police. They
are on their way here now.
Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands.
NICK
Well, I shall be going now. Please
continue without me.
TRENT
Nick, I suggest you remain here and
face the consequences like a man.
Nick stops in front of Trent.
109.
NICK
Thank you for that unsolicited
counsel, Trent. And please, do drop
dead.
The other guests murmur their shock. Nick stops in the
doorway.
NICK
Goodbye, Sheeni. I did it all for
you.
SHEENI
You are completely contemptible,
Nick Twisp. I never wish to see you
again.
With the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears, Nick
leaves.
Joanie opens the door and finds Nick on her doorstep.
NICK
Uh, Hi, Joanie. How's it going?
JOANIE
Nick?
110.
NICK (V.O.)
Since my sister can see through me,
I'm obliged to give a relatively
candid and thorough review of the
events.
Joanie listens gravely, shaking her head at the most gruesome
parts of the story. Nick finishes, flopping into a chair.
JOANIE
Nick, six months ago you were just
another brownnosing honor student.
What happened?
NICK
I'm not really sure. I fell in love
with Sheeni. All I want is to be
with her. The rest is all a big
misunderstanding.
JOANIE
Nick, you've stolen, vandalized,
trespassed, and burned down
Berkeley. All for one girl. If
there's a misunderstanding, it's
with your insight into females.
NICK
But... But where did I go wrong?
JOANIE
Nick, boys your age are always
looking for the path of least
resistance to becoming a man. A
boy's whole self-esteem rests on
how fast he can get a girl into
bed.
NICK
So far, I agree.
JOANIE
Sooner or later what those boys
realize, is that the girls you're
chasing base their self-esteem on
how many hoops they can get the boy
to jump through before going to bed
with him.
Nick furrows his brow. Clearly that had not occurred to him.
JOANIE
So I guess what you should ask
yourself is: How far are you
willing to go?
111.
Nick nods in understanding. An epiphanic smile.
NICK
All the way, Joanie. I'm willing to
go all the way.
Joanie nods in amusement.
JOANIE
You can stay here a couple days,
but eventually they'll come looking
for you. I don't have much money to
give you, but here.
Nick takes the wad of cash, clearly moved.
NICK
Thanks, Joanie. I... Uh... I love
you.
JOANIE
I love you too, you little brat.
Nick slaps the cash on the counter and slides it under the
window.
NICK
One ticket to Ukiah, please.
Lance squats on the toilet in a neck brace. He chuckles over
an issue of Penthouse. The phone rings. He picks it up
LANCE
Yeah.
NICK (V.O.)
Hey, bacon boy, it's Nick.
LANCE
Nick, ya little prick, where are
ya?
Nick sits beside Paul and Lacey on the couch as they watch
the infamous "chicken scene" in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.
NICK (V.O.)
Paul and Lacey are kind enough to
share some leftover fungi to help
calm my nerves. That, combined with
yet another viewing of James Dean's
performance is what gives me my
final burst of inspiration.
They all watch transfixed as JAMES DEAN leaps from his
automobile just in time to escape demise.
As the END CREDITS of REBEL play behind them, Lacey fits a
bombshell wig on Nick's head and finishes the last touches of
make-up that make him...
...who we will come to know as CARLOTTA ULANSKY. Nick regards
his female alter-ego in the mirror.
NICK (V.O.)
Franois of course wants no part of
this, and demands that we make a
run for the border. But I have
decided to veto him. It's time to
face the music.
Nick turns the key in the ignition and CHRISTMAS MUSIC rises
from the speakers. And the music plays over...
Lefty humping Heather in the grass ala the scene in which we
met him.
NICK (V.O.)
...and thus completely compatible
with Lefty's otherwise incongruent
penis.
HEATHER
A little to the right... a
little... RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE!
RIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERE!
NICK (V.O.)
...never would find her perfect A.
Taggarty at her wall. Ed Solomon lounges in the bed behind
her.
NICK (V.O.)
And would therefore start grading
on a curve.
With a quick stroke of her pen, she changes Ed's grade from a
B minus to a B plus.
117.
Joanie serves up a beverage in first class.
NICK
(V.O.)
...and she and
her breasts would
probably go on
to have the
wonderful life
that they deserve.
The CELEBRITY she is serving looks from her cleavage to her
eyes. She gives a little smile.
Estelle watches from the audience as Wally scribbles at his
podium while ALEX TREBECK hosts inaudibly.
NICK (V.O.)
...would go on Jeopardy and win,
ensuring my mother's blessed rise
to a higher economic status.
The answer on Wally's screen says WHO IS ALBERT CAMUS? Alex
Trebeck shakes his head, leaving Wally with only $1, but
enough to best his two competitors.
Carlotta hurriedly finishes tucking herself in while Sheeni
brushes in the bathroom.
Carlotta hastily switches out the light. Sheeni emerges in a
few small scraps of flimsy black lace.
NICK/CARLOTTA
Goodness. What an attractive
negligee.
SHEENI
Do you like it? I bought it in
Santa Rosa last fall. I had hoped
to wear it for Nick.
NICK/CARLOTTA
Oh, darling, I'm sure he would have
found it most... Appealing.
Sheeni crawls into bed. She cuddles close.
120.
SHEENI
I like lying here with you,
Carlotta.
NICK/CARLOTTA
You do?
SHEENI
I can't think of anyone I'd rather
lie here with.
Carlotta furrows her brow.
SHEENI
Except maybe Nick. If Nick were
here, what do you suppose he would
do to me?
NICK/CARLOTTA
Make love to you I would think.
SHEENI
Then why don't you?
NICK/CARLOTTA
Pardon?
SHEENI
Take off that silly wig and make
love to me!
Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room.
NICK
Sheeni! You knew!
SHEENI
Of course, Nick. Did you really
expect to fool your soul mate with
such a disguise?
Nick swoons, grasping her gauze-glazed nakedness.
SHEENI
Take me darling!
And as they engage in a feverish kiss, ROUSING HYMNS surge.
The church chorus' joyful song rings Hallelujah.
The two lovers are entwined before an abstract RED
BACKGROUND.
LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY
Into the NICK'S PENIS nightclub where champagne bottles POP
with the ringing in of a new era, and the Leopards ROAR, and
the stage erupts with fireworks.
121.
Nick sleeps with a grin on his face. He rouses at the touch
of Sheeni's lips on his cheek.
SHEENI
My parents are at services. They
won't be back for hours.
NICK
Shall we have breakfast, my love?
SHEENI
What a lovely notion, darling. You
go ahead downstairs and get things
started.
Sheeni hauls herself out of bed and grabs the phone off the
cradle.
NICK
What are you doing?
SHEENI
Calling Taggarty to report that you
are not completely incompetent in
the bedroom.
NICK
Do I get to stay and hear my grade?
SHEENI
Not a chance, Mr. Twisp. Such
things are reserved for girl talk
only. And for good reason.
She smiles at him and he smiles back.
NICK
Very well, Sheeni. Don't be long.
Nick prances into the living room in his underwear.
He starts to head into the kitchen when he catches sight of
the full length mirror out of the corner of his eye. He stops
in front of the mirror and flexes his biceps. Admires
himself.
Franois appears in the mirror behind Nick, Thompson slung
over his shoulder.
NICK
Well, good morning, Franois. What
do you think?
122.
FRANOIS
What do I sink? I sink now's are
chance to run for ze hills.
Nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow.
NICK
What do you mean?
FRANOIS
Nick, we are young, yes? Is the
world not our oyster? Beaucoup des
filles. Do you not want to know
what it is like to make love to
another girl?
NICK
I do, but... We've come so far.
What about Sheeni?
FRANOIS
Forget Sheeni. Yes, she will always
be ze first conquest, but all zis
time you saught zis was ze end, ze
one and only, when in fact it is
only ze beginning.
Nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany.
In the reflection we can see behind Nick as Albert leaps onto
the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens.
Nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law
enforcement vehicles pull up.
NICK
Sheeni, the police are here!
He ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead.
NICK
Quick! Maybe I can sneak out the
back!
MEGAPHONE (O.S.)
NICK TWISP! WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED!
NICK
I don't understand. How do they
even know I'm alive?
SHEENI (O.S.)
Well, I called them of course.
Nick spins to face her. She's standing in the doorway and
there's not a hint of wrong-doing in her face.
123.
NICK
Well, thanks a pantsful!
SHEENI
But, Nickie, it had to be done.
NICK
But... but why?
SHEENI
I can't very well marry a wanted
man, honey. Look at it this way, in
a few months you'll be a free man
and we can be together in Paris.
Nick looks to Franois in disbelief. But the Frenchman just
rolls his eyes.
FRANOIS
You might as well break it to her
now, Nick.
A long pensive beat as Nick contemplates telling her he may
never see her again. But behind Sheeni's air of control, Nick
finally sees the vulnerability he's had in his hands all
along.
NICK (V.O.)
Franois is right of course, but on
the other hand, why be cruel? After
all, Sheeni had managed to give me
hope every step of the way. And if
hope is what Sheeni would now need
to go on, well then...
NICK
As always, you are right, my love.
Sheeni beams. Franois smacks his forehead with hand.
FRANOIS
Merd.
The Frenchman in the mirror sticks the barrel of the Thompson
in his mouth and blows himself OUT OF FRAME just as...
...the front door bursts open and the FBI AGENTS surround
Nick.
Nick watches out the back window as the car pulls away. A
view of Sheeni waving in the road, Albert at her feet.
NICK (V.O.)
Besides, what jury would convict a
teenager who acted out of love?
And even if I do get to spend the
next few months of my youth getting
Dwayned by the inmates of the
California Juvenile Correctional
System, I did get my thirty two
minutes of lovemaking with one of
the most outstanding girls of this
or any other epoch.
Nick turns to face the front while behind him the waving
figure gets ever more distant. A pensive moment as he
actually questions...
NICK (V.O.)
But was it all worth it?
Nick revisits those thirty two minutes in his mind and it
brings a smirk to his face.
125.
NICK (V.O.)
You bet your left nut it was.
And as Tom Jones' SHE'S A LADY kicks in, we...
