OCEAN - DAY
A vast stretch of ocean.
It fills the screen.
Unbroken,
infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,
meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
and misty light.
FERNANDO (V.O.)
... The sun set in the west on an
ocean where no man had dared to
venture.
And beyond that,
infinity...
Pulling back, we discover:
A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
thirties, are riding a mule.
The MAN'S weather-beaten
face frames unusually bright eyes.
On the screen these words:
ANDALUSIA, 1491
COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
the top of the hill.
COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO
looks up at him in adoration.
FERNANDO (V.O.)
Once I asked my Father where he
wanted to go.
And he replied:
"I
want to travel all over the seas.
I
want to get behind the weather..."
FERNANDO laughs.
He then starts to hum along with his
FATHER.
CUT TO:
HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY
A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone
walls and thousands of sheep.
FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing
the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.
High-
spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.
COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching
his SON'S antics with amusement.
In the distance, the
solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.
COLUMBUS calls out to his son:
COLUMBUS
Fernando!
FERNANDO runs over.
COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.
As they move along the track we now see, perched on a
distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La
Rabida, their destination.
CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY
As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,
FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under
the ROMAN arches.
FERNANDO
Diego!
He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an
adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,
delicate face.
DIEGO'S response is constrained.
COLUMBUS
Diego!
Aren't you going to kiss
your brother?
DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,
hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.
The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-
haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.
MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
arms to greet COLUMBUS.
He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns
to DIEGO.
MARCHENA
Diego, take Fernando to the dining
hall.
He must be hungry.
DIEGO
Yes, Father.
Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.
COLUMBUS and
MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.
MARCHENA
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
to teach -- but so serious...
Brothers should be raised together,
Colon.
Even brothers from different
mothers...
COLUMBUS
Father, I am doing what I think is
the best for him.
And he has the
teacher I would have chosen for
myself.
MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.
MARCHENA
Just be careful you don't lose him.
They have crossed the cloister.
MARCHENA pushes open a
door.
COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING
DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.
COLUMBUS
appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.
DIEGO turns to
go.
COLUMBUS
Diego.
COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes
meet.
He looks at his SON for a moment.
COLUMBUS
Would you like to come and stay with
us?
Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an
answer.
COLUMBUS
I'll do whatever makes you happy.
DIEGO
I am happy, Father.
COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.
He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his
BROTHER as they ride off.
CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT
COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,
through narrow streets.
There's a clamorous noise in the
air.
Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with
excitement, run up the street and brush past them.
Then
more people.
FERNANDO sits up straight.
The noise grows,
rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.
Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
the cathedral.
Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS
tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens
in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:
in the
center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.
HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.
FERNANDO
Look, Father!
Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the
mule and into the crowd.
COLUMBUS
Fernando!
But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.
COLUMBUS tries to follow him.
Flames leap into the night
sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with
a lurid glow.
Prayers are being chanted somewhere.
FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.
A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
MAN bound to a post.
The heretic wears the "sambenito", a
robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,
indicating that the man is Jewish.
THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.
But he refuses to kiss
the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.
FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't
realize what is happening.
He is too close to the
platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.
COLUMBUS
Fernando!
He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him
away from the scene.
But FERNANDO looks back.
The
distance now allows him to see inside the flames.
A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a
silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the
head falls on one shoulder.
Then the whole body collapses
into the fire.
SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY
A medieval "campus".
Students-novices are playing
"pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.
They run
with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing
white legs.
Others are studying, reading, hurrying to
their class.
We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
the court.
Others are waiting with him.
A MONK comes
from a door, and looks around the group.
MONK
(hesitant)
Christopher Columbus?
TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY
The JURY is alone to deliberate.
Food and wine has been
laid out on tables.
In the distance, students' cries
carry over the conversation.
SANCHEZ approaches.
AROJAZ
The Treasurer of Spain honors us
with his presence.
SANCHEZ bows slightly.
SANCHEZ
The State has some reason to be
interested in this man's
proposition, Your Eminence...
AROJAZ
The Judgment is ours!
SANCHEZ
Naturally.
But I would really
deplore the loss of such a potential
opportunity for Spain for a...
dispute over a point of geography.
SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the
other members of the committee, who pretend not to be
listening.
AROJAZ
(interrupting)
He is a mercenary!
Did he not
already try to convince the King of
Portugal of his absurd notions?
SANCHEZ
Indeed.
The world is full of
mercenaries -- and states often make
use of them, when it benefits them.
(casually)
My only concern is the welfare and
prosperity of Spain.
AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.
AROJAZ
You would use your influence to
assist this... intriguer?
SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.
SANCHEZ
You know, Your Eminence, the
fascinating thing about power, is
that what can be given so
effortlessly...
He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts
his glass.
But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,
pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,
leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.
SANCHEZ
... can so easily be taken away.
And he drinks with a smile.
CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY
Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry
in the light breeze.
COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.
Another MONK works nearby, in silence.
PINZON (O.S.)
Senor Colon?
COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:
a
middle-class gentleman.
He nods.
PINZON
Ah, thank God!
I've been looking
all over Seville for you!
Never
expected to find a sailor in a
monastery, eh?
He laughs.
COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.
PINZON is clearly a little surprised.
PINZON
Name's Pinzon, by the way.
Martin
Alonzo Pinzon.
I'm a ship owner
from Palos...
COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way
down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for
PINZON to follow him.
PINZON is yet more surprised by
this strange behavior.
PINZON
(indicating the
monk)
Is he a spy?
COLUMBUS shakes his head.
PINZON stares at him,
perplexed.
PINZON
What is it?
Are you a Trappist?
COLUMBUS shakes his head again.
PINZON
Vow of silence...?
Penance?
COLUMBUS nods vigorously.
PINZON
Jesus!
Just my luck!
He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
cloth.
PINZON
Listen.
I'll do the talking for
both of us.
You just nod.
Agreed?
Just as I do with the wife.
COLUMBUS nods.
PINZON
I know that the Commission turned
you down, right?
What do you
expect?
You're a foreigner... But I
want to help you.
COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
the air.
PINZON
You wonder why I believe in you?
Hey, I am a seaman.
And we don't
like to be told where to go, and
where not to go.
COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.
The other
MONK looks round severely.
COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
PINZON following him.
PINZON lowers his voice.
PINZON
I don't look like it, but I have
friends at the Court.
The Treasurer
of Aragon, for example.
He finances
me.
His name's Santangel.
Ever
heard of him?
COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
interested by what he's hearing.
PINZON
He can get you an audience with the
Queen!
You know why...?
She owes
him money.
That's how it is.
You
-- me -- the Queen -- the world and
his mistress -- agreed?
COLUMBUS nods.
PINZON
So.
What do you say?
COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:
COLUMBUS
Where can I meet this man?
PINZON
(indicating with a
nod)
Immediately.
COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
examining the maps.
STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY
A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
of a mosque.
SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
foot of the tower.
To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a
Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,
COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
scene.
They push through an extraordinary scene.
The city of
Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
several years of siege.
All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS
are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,
bearing only a few possessions.
Ragged, half-starved men,
women and children.
SANTANGEL
These people built Granada...
Centuries ago!
It is a great
victory over the Moors, Don Colon --
and yet what a tragedy it is!
The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting
psalms and flagellating themselves.
At the head of the
procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
Mary swathed in silk and lace.
The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.
COLUMBUS
Is this a good time to meet her?
SANTANGEL
It couldn't be better.
Victors
can't say no.
Bells are pealing triumphantly.
The noise is tumultuous.
They ride towards the magnificent palace.
ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
Fabulous Moorish gardens:
ponds filled with golden carp;
exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant
sounds of victory.
SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted
by HALBERDIERS.
SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or
piles of documents.
As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are
fewer people.
They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where
several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.
SANCHEZ appears.
They bow.
SANTANGEL approaches to
murmur a compliment.
SANTANGEL
Your Excellency... truly grateful...
your help... as ever...
SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a
half-smile forming on his lips.
Then a DUENA appears, and
motions for COLUMBUS to follow.
SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY
A chalk white road, lined with trees.
Two liveried
SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large
silver tray, the other a smaller tray.
They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along
the road, with documents under his arm.
SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY
The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.
In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young
horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.
The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.
Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the
silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of
wine.
They begin to lay them out on a table.
SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER
SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,
while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a
frenzy, reads from a document.
ADMINISTRATOR
... and he demands... he DEMANDS to
be made a Knight, with the right to
bear the Golden Spurs!
He will
receive the title of Don Cristobal
Colon -- which will be extended to
his descendants for ever more...
The ADMINISTRATOR looks up.
He is reading the contract
that COLUMBUS has proposed.
SANCHEZ, his mouth full,
gestures for him to continue.
SANCHEZ
Go on!
ADMINISTRATOR
He will be named Great Admiral of
the Ocean Sea.
Viceroy of the West
Indies... Governor of all islands or
lands discovered or as will be
discovered with his help...
The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.
ADMINISTRATOR
The highest titles of nobility, Your
Excellency!
To an immigrant
sheltered by monks!
SANCHEZ gestures for the document.
Wipes his mouth.
Continues reading, calmly:
SANCHEZ
Furthermore he will receive one
eight of all wealth or monies,
precious gems, pearls, metals,
spices and other lucrative sources
conquered within the boundaries of
his admiralty...
He smiles, hands the document back.
SANCHEZ
It's very underdone.
ADMINISTRATOR
(exploding)
Underdone!
It's monstrous,
Excellency!
SANCHEZ
No, the pheasant.
It's almost raw.
And he carries on eating.
SANCHEZ
You worry too much, Carvajal... The
man will have to lower his demands.
Believe me, he WILL!
ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY
SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.
They see COLUMBUS
striding out and away.
STREET - EVENING
Teeming life.
COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds.
He is expressionless and distracted.
He looks around him, stops walking.
And then,
unexpectedly, shouts.
COLUMBUS
YEEEEEEES!
All heads turn as if he were totally insane.
He walks on
as if nothing happened.
HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN
A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,
down to the harbor.
We see the faces of the SAILORS and
their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We
sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure.
The
procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES
carrying the Madonna.
All hold long, burning tapers,
saying the rosary.
A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and
kisses the Madonna's feet.
PALOS HARBOR - DAWN
Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by
the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.
The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the
quayside.
Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller
fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally
witness this event.
MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN
MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself.
Behind a
curtain sits COLUMBUS.
MARCHENA
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et
Spiritus Sancti.
COLUMBUS
Forgive me, Father.
For I have
sinned.
MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.
MARCHENA
I am listening, my son.
COLUMBUS
Father, I have betrayed my family.
I betrayed my men.
And I betrayed
you.
MARCHENA
What are you saying?
COLUMBUS
I lied.
The journey will be longer
than I said.
MARCHENA
How long?
COLUMBUS
I am not sure... It could be twice
the distance.
A pause.
MARCHENA
May God forgive you...!
You must
tell them!
You must tell your men!
COLUMBUS
If I tell them, they won't follow
me.
You know that I am right,
Father.
You trust me...
MARCHENA
My son, my son...
(he shakes his head)
Your certitudes are sometimes
frightening...
(pause)
Christopher, you must speak to them.
And if you don't I will.
COLUMBUS
You are bound by an oath, Father.
A long silence.
MARCHENA
I believed in you...
COLUMBUS
Give me absolution.
No response.
COLUMBUS
Give me absolution, Father!
Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the
cross.
HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN
COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are
waiting.
He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.
MARCHENA (O.S.)
Ispo Te Absoluto.
May God forgive
you and have mercy on your soul,
Christopher Columbus.
Go in peace.
DISSOLVE TO:
HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER
The CROWDED QUAYSIDE.
COLUMBUS stands in front of
FERNANDO.
COLUMBUS
Be good to your mother, Fernando.
Do you promise?
FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.
Then COLUMBUS embraces
BEATRIX tightly.
She whispers into his ear.
BEATRIX
Speak to Diego.
But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and
instead they clumsily hug.
Someone taps COLUMBUS'
shoulder.
He turns around to see SANTANGEL.
Wordlessly,
they hug.
CUT TO:
Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes
fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now
the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.
The
CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.
WOMEN
holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying...
BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.
COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and
throws it at DIEGO.
COLUMBUS
Diego!
Here!
DIEGO catches it.
Opening his hand he looks at the
medallion.
Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.
THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY.
SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.
SANTANGEL
(casually)
Take care of my investment, wherever
you're going!
COLUMBUS
(ambiguous)
I have to tell you Santangel.
I
don't know where on earth I am
going!
They both laugh.
A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand
slide gently along the gigantic hull.
He stares up at the
SAILORS leaning on the rail.
SAILOR
Vaya con Dios!
(Go with God!)
They wave back.
CUT TO:
MARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.
He finally
turns, sad and distraught.
He sees:
CUT TO:
SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY
THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.
The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.
A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable
metamorphosis.
Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety
of the crew, the fear of the unknown...
ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging
majestically through the waves.
Sinking back,
disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.
DECK - DAY
A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.
A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.
A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of
the evening meal.
TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,
punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.
SANTA MARIA - NIGHT
The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
instrument.
COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the
prow.
Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.
SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.
One of them is
ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.
Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.
He
makes an entry in the log.
Then goes back to his
quadrant.
He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.
COLUMBUS
(softly)
Due west, Captain Mendez.
And may
God be with us...
MENDEZ
God be with us admiral.
MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.
COLUMBUS
What is it Mendez?
Speak!
MENDEZ is hesitant.
He nervously clears his throat.
MENDEZ
Well... It's the men, Sir.
They
wonder how you know our position.
We've lost sight from land days
ago...
COLUMBUS
(still taking
readings)
And what do you think Mendez?
MENDEZ
Well, I surely know what a quadrant
is!
But I've never seen it used at
night before.
COLUMBUS
Come over here.
MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS.
The SAILORS
are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.
COLUMBUS
Now, find the North Star.
Do you
have it?
CUT TO:
The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the
north star.
COLUMBUS (O.S.)
Steady yourself...!
Keep the plumb
line vertical...
The picture steadies.
CUT TO:
MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium.
The plumb line
swings.
COLUMBUS
Don't move!
A mistake of one degree
and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!
MENDEZ tries again.
COLUMBUS
What do you read?
MENDEZ
Twenty eight.
MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.
COLUMBUS
That's it.
The twenty eighth
parallel.
And we'll follow it until
we reach land.
ALONSO does not seem convinced.
ALONSO
How do you know land is on the
twenty eighth parallel?
SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
A blazing sun.
The ship is like a furnace, its brass
fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the
air shimmer over the decks.
Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the
sagging prow sail.
The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope
over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with
water.
As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair
lip.
He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO
watches him.
ALONSO
Chicken-ass face!
The others laugh.
The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them.
ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he
reacts like he was burnt.
ALONSO
Shit!
He sucks his blistered fingers.
ALONSO
I never seen heat like this!
Not
even in Las Minas!
SAILOR
The water's going putrid in the
barrels.
ALONSO
You'll be drinking your own piss...
For the glory of Spain... and
Admiral Colon...!
Bastard!
The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.
ALONSO
What are you listening to, chicken
ass?
SAILOR
Ah, leave him alone.
He's doing no
harm.
ALONSO
With a face like that?
(to boy)
I don't want you looking at me.
You
hear?
The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.
ALONSO
He's the devil's child...
SAILOR
We'll all go crazy...
The BOY throws more water over the deck.
A SAILOR takes
his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.
SAILOR
Culo de galina es el hijo del
demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the
devil's child... Born from the loins
of a stinky old goat etc...)
They all laugh.
The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the
crow's-nest like a monkey.
SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY
We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the
main mast, high above the rolling deck.
The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest,
exhausted by the heat, and scared.
His eyes are turning
white.
He begins to piss himself...
CUT TO:
SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
Piss is dripping on the deck.
THE SAILORS do not seem to
care.
THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.
He breaks
its neck, and starts plucking it.
The OTHERS continue
their bitter conversation.
ALONSO
We should have seen land.
SAILOR
We left three weeks ago, Alonso.
Can't be that near.
ALONSO
Can't be that far, I say.
Also, I
don't like the smell of the sea
around here.
Smells like a cunt.
Bad sign...
The COOK starts laughing.
They turn to him.
COOK
(shaking his head)
Of course it smells like it!
That's
why sailors take to the sea!
They all laugh.
Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on
the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the
land to appear.
ALONSO
And why does this one take to the
sea?
Nobody knows.
Never says a
word...
MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.
He
approaches them.
MENDEZ
To your post!
At once!
They split in silence.
SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT
The SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS
sleep on deck.
The SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.
Despite his hair
lip he has a pure, melancholy voice...
COLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears
it carry over the darkness.
SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.
The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board.
We
follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full
length of the hull.
As it reaches the poop deck, another
SAILOR shouts "MARK".
A very primitive system of
calculation for distance and speed.
Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in
a log-book, watching the hourglass.
SHIP'S BOY
Mark.
Twenty nine, Sir!
THE HOUR-GLASS runs out.
COLUMBUS converts the mark into
a daily average for distance and speed.
COLUMBUS
Six hundred and twenty nine.
THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.
CUT TO:
PINTA - DAY
PINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA
MARIA.
SHIP'S BOY
Six hundred and twenty nine!
AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.
OFFICER
Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!
PINZON does not seem too pleased.
PINZON
I heard.
THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.
OFFICER
Captain, I don't understand.
PINZON
I think I do.
He goes back to his cabin.
CUT TO:
SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY
ABSOLUTE STILLNESS.
A FURNACE.
The three ships like
dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed.
The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.
CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.
FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.
ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant
figure with hate and resentment.
ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat
into disarray.
Chaos.
Total silence.
MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.
MENDEZ
Continue rowing!
ALONSO
To where?
ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.
He then starts to beat
a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the
others.
In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow
suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.
MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.
ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his
mouth.
OFFICER
Captain Pinzon requests permission
to board.
CUT TO:
SANTA MARIA - DAY
COLUMBUS
Granted.
SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
Most of the men are now back on board.
They go silent as COLUMBUS appears.
He walks slowly over
to them.
All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...
COLUMBUS
Who gave you the order to come on
board?
He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.
They
stare at one another.
ALONSO
God doesn't want us to cross the
ocean...!
This voyage is cursed!
Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.
COLUMBUS
Cursed?
ALONSO
We set sail for greed.
God has
abandoned us.
The voyage is cursed.
There are signs...
ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.
The BOY lowers his eyes.
COLUMBUS moves towards him,
pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.
COLUMBUS
This boy has the voice of an angel.
What comes out of his mouth is
blessed, Alonso.
What comes out of
your is evil.
Some of the men laugh at this statement.
ALONSO is ill at
ease.
COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.
COLUMBUS
Listen to me!
Every man is afraid
who does something for the first
time.
But those who overcome their
fears, will find their rewards.
I
do not know if it is God's will that
we cross this ocean -- but I am
certain it is the devil who puts
fears into our hearts...
The MEN are listening.
We sense a subtle change of
mood...
COLUMBUS
This jacket to the first man who
sights land!
I want a man up that
mast day and night.
COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.
COLUMBUS
You start first.
The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.
As he climbs, the
mainsail starts to fill with wind.
The deck begins to
move under their feet.
This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
erase the fears and the angers.
MENDEZ
Alonso!
Jaime!
Don't let this wind
escape us.
CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut,
filling with wind.
MEN rush to their posts.
PINZON
stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.
PINZON
(murmuring)
You lucky bastard...
COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to
PINZON.
COLUMBUS
Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier
I get.
Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.
SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT
COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his
cape, struggling against the sleep.
MENDEZ approaches him
with a bowl of soup.
MENDEZ
Shall I take my turn?
COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the
bowl.
CUT TO:
COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest.
He is
asleep.
We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound.
It
becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face.
A mosquito lands on his temple.
COLUMBUS reflexively
slaps it.
He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot
of blood, a crushed mosquito.
He stares at it for a
moment.
Then slowly gets to his feet.
SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT
In the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring
up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast
lantern.
We hear the flutter of their wings and see the
bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy.
COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see
the land that must be close.
He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket.
He touches his
shoulder.
COLUMBUS
(murmuring)
Mendez!
Mendez!
MENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye.
COLUMBUS
Land...
CUT TO:
SHIP - DAWN
An opaque dawn.
COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if
to pierce the mist.
The entire crew are clinging to the
rail, and standing on the shrouds.
Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion.
SHIP'S BOY
TIERRA...!
TIERRA!
COLUMBUS strains his eyes; he still can not see anything.
The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their
breath.
As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly,
exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems
almost as though they could touch it.
Then a white slash
of beach.
Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into
tears.
Others laugh with joy.
COLUMBUS watches this
vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were
difficult for him to breathe.
Tears come to his eyes.
He
closes them.
Then opens them again.
The land is there --
a green paradise.
On screen the words:
OCTOBER 12, 1942.
GUANAHAN ISLAND
BOATS - DAY
Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the
beach.
COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat.
MENDEZ is in the second.
PINZON the third.
They stare
entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue
clarity of the water...
As the first boat beaches, COLUMBUS leaps out and wades
ashore.
Behind him the rest of the landing party splash
through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of
Castille and Aragon.
BEACH - DAY
They stand on the beach, almost in a dream.
There is
silence.
The ROYAL NOTARY, ludicrously overdressed, now
wet through, stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his
contract and a pen.
COLUMBUS scrawls his name.
The MEN stare at him, filled not only with new respect,
but with something amounting to awe.
COLUMBUS turns to them, tries to speak.
COLUMBUS
By the... by the Grace of... God...
He swallows.
Tears have sprung to his eyes.
He is so
moved he cannot continue.
Coming to his rescue -- THE
SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum.
He then stops.
COLUMBUS
(pulling himself
together)
In the name of their Gracious
Majesties of Castille and Aragon,
and by all the powers vested in me,
I claim this island and name it San
Salvador.
The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand,
flapping in the wind.
COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence
the rest follow.
JUNGLE - DAY
Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND!
The jungle is filled with NOISE.
The impossibly-loud
CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS, the CHATTERING of MONKEYS.
The
SPANIARDS are overwhelmed.
They move forward.
Rays of sunlight pierce through the
high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent
cathedral.
The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses.
They are filled with wonder.
Then PINZON stops.
He has seen something.
Another stops,
then a third, staring ahead of them...
MENDEZ
(whispering
urgently)
Arquebuses!
Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders,
pointing them into the jungle.
From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick
jungle ahead.
For a moment we don't see anything -- and
then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN.
Naked,
painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance.
As if they had materialized from nowhere:
the rest of the
HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears.
Silent.
Watchful.
They stare back at us.
The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons.
COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air:
a clear
signal not to fire.
Then, removing his sword, he drops it
on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze
upon the first INDIAN he saw.
PINZON
(warningly)
Colon!
COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have
raised their weapons.
He stops in the no-man's land
between them.
The INDIANS don't move -- but something
excites them.
The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and
the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to
him.
He is the cause of their interest.
COLUMBUS puts
his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection
seems to put the INDIANS at their ease.
They start
talking and pointing.
They come forward slowly, start to
tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket.
Then, now laughing,
they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard.
COLUMBUS
laughs too.
Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their
weapons.
Some of them laugh.
An apparition:
a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally
naked, walks out of the jungle.
She is pregnant and holds a child.
We begin to hear
Indian music, played on a flute.
CUT TO:
INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY
A large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS
pulling on ropes.
The post is fixed into position -- and
then we see that it is a large wooden cross... The INDIAN
VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and
amusement.
COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at the
INDIANS.
COLUMBUS
We have come here in peace, and we
will behave with honor.
They are
not savages and neither will you be.
Treat these people as you would your
own wives and your own children.
Neither are you free to take what
you will; for a seashell you give a
bandana.
You will respect their
beliefs.
Pillage will be punished
by the whip.
Rape by the sword.
VILLAGE - SUNSET
The smoke from fires.
Laughter.
Music playing.
The
INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS, who are
drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world.
COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ, PINZON, the INDIAN CHIEF,
ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE.
Other INDIANS stand around,
smiling, curious.
The INDIANS talk among themselves.
The ELDERS smoke
primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to
their guests.
The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first...
and laugh.
In return, they offer the INDIANS wine...
Dogs roam around the campfires.
The WOMEN openly suckle
their babies.
The MEN are entranced.
PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small
gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS.
He
points to it, indicates his interest in it.
PINZON
Gold...!
Gold!
The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing.
We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold
ornaments.
PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.
The INDIAN
removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON,
who indicates that he wants to have it.
The INDIAN nods
-- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants
it in return.
PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN
from taking it.
COLUMBUS
(to Pinzon)
Give it to him!
PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS
insists.
PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the
INDIAN.
PINZON
(irritated)
By God!
That's the worst trade of
my life!
His friends laugh.
Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by
the blade.
He yelps, looks down at the blood welling
up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his
clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN
laughs.
Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw,
squatting on his haunches, watching.
This is UTAPAN.
JUNGLE - MORNING
UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.
COLUMBUS
follows him.
UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.
COLUMBUS obeys.
UTAPAN
looks up at the tops of the trees.
The sun is rising, and
filters through the foliage.
As if the time had come,
UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.
A gap in the dense vegetation.
Something is glittering.
Gold.
A mass of gold.
As they approach, COLUMBUS
discovers --
A large pool of fresh water.
The morning sunlight has
turned the water into liquid gold.
The surface ripples
with the breeze.
UTAPAN smiles.
It the stranger
satisfied?
Isn't this what he came for?
COLUMBUS plunges into the pool.
As he emerges, he fills
his palms with liquid gold.
DISSOLVE TO:
RIVER - DAY
Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream.
INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the
canoes.
UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft.
THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we
notice that some other crew members are beardless, some
even wearing tribal patterns.
RIVERSIDE - DAY
INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks
to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON.
UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing
some artifacts.
The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no,
indicating another distant place.
OLD INDIAN
Cuba!
Cuba!
THE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away
to UTAPAN.
UTAPAN
Say not here!
Cuba!
COLUMBUS
What is it?
A tribe?
An island?
UTAPAN
Island.
Far.
SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY
Standing at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair
floating in the wind, UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed.
THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY
Led by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick
jungle.
It's hard work.
The MEN sweat.
This is
inhospitable terrain.
Even the noises of the jungle seem
somehow more sinister...
CUT TO:
RESTING PLACE - ALONSO is seated under a tree.
He takes
off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters
on his toes.
As he puts his foot back into the boot, he
jumps screaming in pain.
ALONSO yelps, grasping his ankle.
CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot.
While his COMPANIONS rush to him, a SAILOR spots the
snake, and decapitates it with his sword.
UTAPAN glances
at the dead snake.
He then goes and kneels -- he sees the
bite on ALONSO'S ankle.
COLUMBUS
Help him!
ALONSO is quiet and silent.
His eyes are looking around
at his companions.
UTAPAN shakes his head.
There is
nothing he can do.
ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his
friends.
He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR.
His
look is already far away.
His companion shouts at UTAPAN.
SAILOR
Do something!
Help him!
UTAPAN
He dead.
ALONSO starts convulsing.
HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate
in their helplessness.
Others simply move away,
horrified.
One of them cries.
RIVER - DAY
Standing in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a
gold expert) examines some stones.
He then looks up at
COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into
the water without a word.
The group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the
humidity.
Some are drinking from the river, others soak
bandanas, and tie them around their necks...
One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look
discouraged, tired, and beaten.
MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY
UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.
Fully
armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and
the vicious insect bites.
COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly
trots forward.
Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.
He
calls out to UTAPAN.
COLUMBUS
Utapan!
Wait!
UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with
comical energy.
On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning
against a tree.
He has removed his helmet.
His hair
sticking to his forehead.
As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another
SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around
PINZON.
Ashen, he burns with fever.
He attempts a smile.
PINZON
Well... You'll have to continue
without me...
COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees:
exhausted men
and jungle, as far as one can see.
COLUMBUS
No.
It's enough.
What would you
say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon?
PINZON grins.
PINZON
And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb!
I'd sell my soul for it.
(to his officer)
Help me up.
I've got to piss, gold.
They all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet.
PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to
urinate.
It is red.
Suddenly dizzy, he reels and
collapses.
JUNGLE - DAY
A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a
mountainside.
PINZON is being carried on a makeshift
stretcher.
His eyes are closed, his face thick with
sweat.
They enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS.
UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.
SHORE - DAY
Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty
of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull
out towards the two remaining ships.
PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat.
COLUMBUS,
UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat.
COLUMBUS (V.O.)
March 1493... Thirty nine of my men
volunteered to stay behind.
God
willing we will be back in less than
a year...
The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore
growing smaller.
CUT TO:
COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT
CLOSE ON:
a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings
violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if
the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty
in his log-book.
COLUMBUS (V.O.)
... Several men are ill.
We did not
find signs of civilization.
No
cities, no temples... Nothing that
resembles Marco Polo's descriptions.
My ships are not filled with the
spices and the gold that Spain was
hoping for.
But this land
intoxicates the senses like the
strongest of perfumes... And all I
can think of, is to return to these
untamed lands...
Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.
Things fall from
the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.
SEA - NIGHT
We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying
proportions.
The thunder is deafening.
Light irradiates
the darkness.
We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the
massive seas.
DECK - NIGHT
Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.
The deck
jumps and rolls.
It rises five meters into the air then
falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.
Waves sweep over the decks.
We hear desperate cries for
mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard
above the storm.
COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a
lifeline.
COLUMBUS
(screaming to the
sailors)
Get below!
All of you!
Go!
The MEN start to scramble below decks.
COLUMBUS
(to Mendez)
Stay with me!
The ship rolls again.
COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards
the mast.
Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons
of water falling like cement.
They reach the mast.
The
wood groans.
COLUMBUS
We may have to cut it!
MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.
The ship rises
into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing
beneath them for a moment.
COLUMBUS
(screaming out)
I'll stay here -- to decide if we
cut it.
Help me!
With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast:
one
rope under his arms, the other around his waist.
MENDEZ
hands him a horn.
COLUMBUS
(screaming)
Now go!
MENDEZ seems to hesitate.
COLUMBUS screams at him again.
COLUMBUS
I said -- below deck, Mendez!
MENDEZ crawls away.
Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS.
He emerges,
almost suffocated.
The storm rages, its eerie light
making it seem at times like bright daylight.
But as the
lightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:
COLUMBUS
One... two... three... four...
There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates
how close they are to the eye of the storm.
The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming
never to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens,
screams out:
COLUMBUS
Damn you!
As if in answer, another flash of lightning that
illuminates the sky and the sea.
COLUMBUS starts counting
again.
COLUMBUS
One... two... three... four...
five...
Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- COLUMBUS
starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on.
Then, in the strange light, something seems to move
through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of
projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor.
COLUMBUS stares up at it... amazed.
We start to hear the
"Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.
CUT TO:
GALLERY - DAY
The large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE --
applicants for the voyage.
As COLUMBUS appears, they all
press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his
attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint.
They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS.
COLUMBUS
nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there...
COLUMBUS
Of course... Of course... We'll see
to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon...
Soon...
Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way,
reaching the other side of the gallery.
We get glimpses
of the incredible activity down below.
ADMINISTRATORS,
MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered
with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second
expedition.
COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.
COLUMBUS
(indicating the
applicants)
Now -- you tell me.
Who can I
trust?
(almost amused)
We're brothers!
We must be a House.
A bloodline!
In this country one
can't exist alone!
I need you...!
Both of you!
He walks then to the balustrade.
The cries from the
courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants
begin to look up, aware of his presence.
SOLDIER
Where is the Admiral?
Has anyone
seen the Admiral?
Everybody laughs.
COLUMBUS
He is here!
What is it?
He leans over the balcony.
In the middle of the
overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is
brandishing a document.
MAN
Admiral!
The horses have arrived.
COLUMBUS
I know.
I saw them!
Who did we
hire today?
ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.
ASSISTANT
Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight
halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a
hundred farmers, twenty miners...
and Doctor Chanca, the royal
surgeon.
COLUMBUS
The royal surgeon?
Then we can
count on royal health!
The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.
ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAY
UTAPAN is lying in his hammock.
FERNANDO turns him over.
UTAPAN falls to the ground.
COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.
COLUMBUS
(looking at his son)
He's growing up!
BEATRIX smiles, nods.
They walk on.
COLUMBUS
Beatrix, I want to ask you
something.
BEATRIX
(with a smile)
You don't usually ask.
COLUMBUS
(after a pause)
I can arrange for the Queen to take
Fernando and Diego into her service.
BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.
COLUMBUS
It is a great honor.
We could not
hope for anything better.
BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at
FERNANDO.
BEATRIX
For once I wish you weren't right.
COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her
closer, they move away.
FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY
FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.
UTAPAN
is pushing him gently.
He slowly straightens up to watch
COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a
dilemma.
FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to
his parents.
The arbor is empty.
FERNANDO becomes
pensive.
We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY
FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking
towards the jungle.
COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS,
and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN.
MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back
and forth across the sand.
All are waiting.
A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.
Birds
scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence,
complete and ominous.
COLUMBUS stares into the jungle.
Nothing.
No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from
the MEN they left behind.
COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ.
MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer.
MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the
trees.
The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning
out as they do so, weapons at the ready.
CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY
Ruins.
The camp has been burned to ashes.
A strange
sight:
arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each
with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the
flight.
In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the
devastation.
The ground is littered with coconuts.
Kicking one over
with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is
actually a human skull.
The gaping mouth has been filled
to the brim with gold.
But of the living, there is no sign.
MOXICA
Is this your new world, Don Colon?
COLUMBUS looks around in dismay.
A YOUNG NOBLEMAN,
HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.
GUEVARA
These animals should be shown what
savagery can be!
Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.
NOBLEMAN
Three heads for every life taken.
No mercy before God!
GUEVARA
No mercy!
Let's find them.
COLUMBUS
No Guevara.
There will be no
revenge.
Silence.
Everyone looks at COLUMBUS.
MOXICA
We lost cousins, friends.
We will
wash this in blood.
COLUMBUS
If you want to keep your head on
your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
They are all listening.
COLUMBUS
Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty
nine brave men who trusted me.
He walks among them.
COLUMBUS
You want a war?
Fine.
We are a
thousand.
They outnumber us by ten!
Who will you kill?
Which tribe?
MOXICA
We don't need to know.
COLUMBUS
We came here to stay!
To build!
Not to start a crusade.
In this
forest, there is enough danger to
sweep us away in days!
So we will
be brave and swallow our grief.
And
in the name of those who died, we
will accomplish what we came for.
INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY
MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters
to the edge of the deserted village and enters the
village.
UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything
living.
All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.
The
animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously.
UTAPAN calls out in dialect.
UTAPAN
They here.
Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other --
materializing from the jungle.
Shy and scared.
They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN
seem to be one -- a God).
To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move
sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing
the air.
THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,
who stands his ground, brandishing his lance.
UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the
centaur.
He places his hand onto the shoulder of the
animal.
The muscles shudder.
THE INDIAN jumps back
comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.
Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.
More
INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.
Now
more have ventured from the jungle.
The bravest of them
approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse,
retreating then touching until they fill the compound.
At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all
around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows.
A moment of tension.
COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we
meet before.
COLUMBUS
Ask the Chief what happened to my
men?
The CHIEF answers.
UTAPAN
Another tribe made war on them...
came by sea... took them away...
BROTHER BUYL
God have mercy on their souls...
MOXICA
The monkey is lying.
A pause.
The SPANIARDS shifting, eager for blood.
MOXICA
We should kill them, Don Colon.
UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.
COLUMBUS
No...!
you'll do it my way.
(to Utapan)
Tell the Chief we will not harm his
people, even though we have the
power to do it.
UTAPAN translates.
The CHIEF listens in silence.
COLUMBUS
We will work with his people.
We
want peace.
Ask the Chief if he
understands?
UTAPAN
He understands.
COLUMBUS
Ask him if he will help.
CUT TO:
WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY
It is raining hard.
COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud,
supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS.
They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a
watermill.
Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the
wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep.
Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene.
COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit
and approaches him.
COLUMBUS
Don Moxica -- we need your horse.
MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.
COLUMBUS
We can't raise the wheel without it.
MOXICA
My horse doesn't work.
A beat.
COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes.
COLUMBUS
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
MOXICA
You did not hear me, Don Colon.
Not
my horse.
He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.
COLUMBUS
Forgive me, Don Moxica.
But it was
your horse I was talking about.
A beat.
MOXICA stares down at an equally determined
COLUMBUS.
Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to
dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.
COLUMBUS
Thank you, Don Moxica.
COLUMBUS leads the horse away.
CUT TO:
WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY
Harnessed, the horse pulls, with COLUMBUS and the MEN.
The wheel is raised into position.
CUT TO:
WATERMILL AND DAM - DAY
Water thundering into the new canal.
The huge wheel
begins to turn.
The MEN cheer and congratulate each
other.
MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming
horse, his eyes full of hatred.
CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT
A wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge
wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered
by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles
burning in the doorways.
A main square with the
Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church.
In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning,
dirty and tired.
VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the
MEN return.
MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.
MOXICA
To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!
They laugh.
We see the smoke and flames from a fire.
Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby,
cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language.
MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked
YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more
wine.
GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.
MOXICA,
letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles
at him.
MOXICA
Do you want her?
He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her
properly.
GUEVARA nods.
MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a
peremptory order, and she disappears back inside.
GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping
his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:
GUEVARA
To the new world, my friend!
To the
new world!
BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
They are drinking and smoking cigars.
From the balcony
they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away.
GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair.
BARTOLOME sees
it, and elbows COLUMBUS.
They both smile at their younger
brother's exhaustion.
Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on
the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle
beyond.
COLUMBUS
How much gold have we found?
BARTOLOME
Not enough to justify a single
shipment.
COLUMBUS
Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere
but in my imagination.
BARTOLOME
Then let's hope not...
(pause)
What will happen if we can't find
enough gold?
They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy
sound.
COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a
mosquito by slapping his arm.
COLUMBUS
(jokingly)
Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.
CUT TO:
ROYAL HOSPITAL - COURTYARD - SPAIN - DAY
A MAN covered with sores is screaming, thrashing in his
agony.
He is held down, his voice muffled.
ISABEL turns
away, shocked.
She is in a ward full of patients, attended by a DOCTOR,
SANCHEZ and other members of her court.
The patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered
with virulent sores.
NUNS move between the beds.
DOCTOR
It seems to be caused by intimacy
with the native women, Your Majesty.
ISABEL
Will he survive?
DOCTOR
No, Your Majesty.
They go mad --
then they die.
There is nothing we
can do.
ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ, appalled.
SANCHEZ
Every ship returns with a cargo of
sick and dying.
But with no gold!
The new world proves expensive, Your
Majesty.
ISABEL
We weren't expecting immediate
profits, were we?
We must have
faith.
We must give time for time.
SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement.
But ISABEL, despite her
words, looks distressed.
MINE - NEW WORLD - DAY
Excavations carved into a hillside.
It is a blisteringly hot day.
At the foot of the hill,
GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and
several CLERKS.
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in
line at the table.
In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold.
The
CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each
contribution.
MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster
with a thonged crop.
An INDIAN approaches the table.
He
is nervous.
He doesn't produce anything.
The INDIAN
shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.
TRANSLATOR
He says he has not found any!
MOXICA
He's lying!
Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates.
MOXICA hits him
across the face with the thonged crop.
The INDIAN tries
to run away -- but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER.
MOXICA
Bring him here!
The frightened INDIAN is brought back to the table.
One
of the CLERKS slips away.
MOXICA
Tell him to put his hands on the
table.
Like this!
CUT TO:
OTHER SIDE OF THE SITE - DAY
At the other end of the site, the CLERK sprinting to
GIACOMO, who was talking to a FOREMASTER.
CLERK
Don Giacomo, you'd better come at
once!
MINE - DAY
MOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS,
still passively waiting.
MOXICA
Tell them I want them to watch this!
The terrified TRANSLATOR speaks to the INDIANS.
CLERK
Don't Moxica!
You can't...
CUT TO:
GIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene.
CUT TO:
MOXICA
(to the clerk)
I can't?
I can't?
With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and
cuts off the INDIAN'S hands.
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
The INDIANS flee, disappearing
into the jungle.
GIACOMO arrives at this moment.
He
stares at the dismembered hands in horror.
BARRACKS - NIGHT
Everything is quiet on the mine site.
On the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and
cracking jokes.
One of them leans against the wooden
wall.
He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him.
CUT TO:
BARRACKS - NIGHT
On the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage
his efforts.
A whooshing sound.
An arrow embeds itself in the chest of
the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall.
He is
nailed to the wood behind him.
THE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an
arrow pierces his throat.
He collapses, unable to cry
out for help.
MINE - DAY
PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air.
Pulling back, we discover:
A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding
of the excavations.
Some hands and noses have been
removed.
UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS.
A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.
One of
the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.
He is
still alive -- not for long.
COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage.
BARTOLOME
(aggressively)
Moxica is right.
Our ways don't
work!
BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.
BARTOLOME
(aggressively)
Can you find them?
UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is
being asked to do something against his own people.
He
looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.
COLUMBUS
You have to find them, Utapan.
Look
what they did!
UTAPAN
You did the same to your God!
COLUMBUS is caught short.
COLUMBUS
We have to stop this war.
UTAPAN nods.
He walks and takes an arrow.
He examines
it.
COLUMBUS
Do you know them?
UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable.
CUT TO:
HILL AND VALLEY - DAY
Around a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting.
They
are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole
from the mine.
CLICK!
CLICK!
The INDIANS raise their
heads.
All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed
at them.
Two INDIANS try to run away.
They are shot.
This sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.
They start
shooting at random.
UTAPAN is horrified.
COLUMBUS stands
up shouting.
COLUMBUS
Stop!
Stop this!
CUT TO:
GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT
MOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them),
silently approach the entrance of the mansion.
A GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry.
SQUARE OF ISABEL - NIGHT
The half-burnt remains of the Mansion.
COLUMBUS stands in
the square, looking up at it.
Behind him, his SOLDIERS,
his BROTHERS and about thirty captured INDIANS.
GIACOMO walks slowly across the square.
COLUMBUS looks at
him in disbelief.
GIACOMO
(through cracked
lips)
Moxica...
RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN
COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle,
looking for the MUTINEERS.
They reach the river -- scan the far bank.
Nothing.
COLUMBUS nods.
His MEN start to enter the river, led by a
HALBERDIER.
Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above
their heads.
A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.
Without a cry he
falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the
current.
Two more MEN are hit.
One cries out, thrashes around in
the water, an arrow protruding from his side.
The river
stained with blood.
Still no sign of the enemy.
COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless
start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield...
others continue to wade across the river.
A MUTINEER is
shot down from the branches of a tree...
The first MEN come ashore.
Musket fire.
An exchange of
arrows.
COLUMBUS is now wading across.
The MAN next to
him is killed, and carried away by the current.
Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves.
There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other
weapons.
MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own
are outnumbered and outmatched.
Already, some are
beginning to surrender.
In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls
himself out of the river:
A MUTINEER lunges at him.
COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks
forward into the jungle.
He spots MOXICA at the foot of a
cliff.
JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY
MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with
COLUMBUS following.
The climb through the dense
undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing
in slow motion.
TOP OF CLIFF - DAY
MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth.
He is at the edge
of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind.
He turns
frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him.
Knowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance.
He steps backwards towards the edge.
MOXICA
You know what they will say in Spain
about my death -- don't you?
He takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards
him.
MOXICA
You are nothing!
You bastards will
never inherit your titles.
We are
everything.
We are immortal!
He smiles, and steps back into space.
ROCKS BELOW CLIFF TOP - DAY
His body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into
the water.
TOP OF CLIFF - DAY
COLUMBUS stares down as his body is swept away.
CUT TO:
SQUARE OF ISABEL - DAY
CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face.
CUT TO:
A MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and
trembling.
His arms are tied behind his back.
He is held
fast, a rope is put around his neck.
COLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives
a signal.
Drums begin to beat.
BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive.
A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face.
He is
being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope.
The
YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly.
We hear the choking.
The drums cease.
BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs
a prayer, deeply distraught.
GIACOMO has covered his
eyes.
A wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS
from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole,
their heads straight, the rope still tight around their
necks.
Justice has been done.
The members of the COUNCIL rise in
silence, COLUMBUS stands up.
CUT TO:
ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY
CLOSE ON several large wooden cages.
Inside we see the
INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured.
They are packed together.
They stare out with vacant eyes.
SOLDIERS guard them.
A
ship against the pier.
BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares
at the INDIANS.
BROTHER BUYL
I wish to go back with them, Don
Colon.
I have no desire to remain
in this godless place.
COLUMBUS
You may do as you please, Brother
Buyl -- though your departure will
not help me to make it more Godly.
BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment.
BROTHER BUYL
You treat Christians equally with
heathen savages.
You execute
members of the nobility.
And what
do you offer in return?
COLUMBUS
(quietly)
A new world, Brother Buyl.
BROTHER BUYL
Nobody wants one...!
Only you!
And he walks away.
ISLAND - EVENING
Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join
the sky to the sea.
A gust of wind disturbs the roof of
the jungle.
JUNGLE - NEAR ISABEL - NIGHT
UTAPAN begins to shave his head...
BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAWN
The sky is dark and threatening, the wind even stronger.
We find COLUMBUS where we left him, but now alone.
He has
sat here all night.
Shutters bang violently.
He looks up -- and sees a few yards from him:
the naked
FIGURE OF AN INDIAN, his face and body painted, staring at
him.
COLUMBUS realizes who it is...
COLUMBUS
Utapan!
UTAPAN is still and silent.
A strange and mysterious
figure now.
COLUMBUS
Utapan, won't you speak to me?
You
used to know how to speak to me.
UTAPAN
(sadly, in his own
language)
You never learned how to speak my
language.
UTAPAN is gone.
SQUARE - DAWN
The wind is whipping the trees now, stronger and stronger.
Groups of INDIANS look up at the sky.
Then, above the
sound of the wind, they hear another noise.
Like a
collective murmur, almost in one voice, the INDIANS
repeat, over and over.
INDIANS
Urracan... Urracan... Urracan...
Urracan...
(the wrath of God)
With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks.
In a
few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the
landscape is drenched in torrential rain.
The wind
doubles its strength... and all hell breaks loose...
CITY OF ISABEL - DAY
The hurricane is full force.
Trees are being ripped up by
their roots.
Rivers of mud are washed down from the
hills, carrying everything away in their paths:
houses,
carts, equipment, horses...
MINE - ISABEL - DAY
The mine workings flooded with mud...
APPROACH TO DAM AND WATERFALL - DAY
COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME and MENDEZ struggle through the teeth
of the hurricane towards the dam.
DAM - DAY
Timbers creak and strain.
COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME, MENDEZ and
a DOZEN other MEN are trying to save the dam.
Suddenly, frighteningly, the dam begins to crash.
COLUMBUS
(screaming)
Let it go!
Let it go!
The MEN scramble away as the dam wall buckles, and burst
open.
Water floods over them; a roaring torrent.
From
the bank, MENDEZ, BARTOLOME and COLUMBUS survey the ruins
of their dreams.
CUT TO:
QUAYSIDE - ISABEL - DAY
We see a buckled shoe -- as it rises, it slips into a
stirrup.
The horse is mounted.
The shoe digs into its
flank.
The sound of hoofbeats...
SANCHEZ (V.O.)
I am thinking of a man.
A devotee
to Your Majesties.
A man extremely
motivated...
DISSOLVE TO:
STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY
FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes,
canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel.
Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the
hurricane are still visible...
People look at them curiously.
We see them stop near the
Governor's mansion.
The MEN dismount and walk into the
Palace.
COLUMBUS' MANOR HOUSE - DAY
COLUMBUS dismounts in the courtyard.
Everything seems
deserted.
There's no one about, no sign of life...
SHIP'S DECK - FERNANDO'S POV - NIGHT
Night on the open sea -- the moon shines on the waves and
we hear the creaking of ropes and timbers -- the
loneliness and mystery of the night passage.
SAILOR'S VOICE
West... southwest, Captain Mendez...
MENDEZ (O.S.)
Steady as she goes...
COLUMBUS walks over to FERNANDO, who is leaning against
the rail.
He is smoking a cigar... as the smoke blows
over FERNANDO'S face, FERNANDO wretches... It's clear he's
feeling seasick, trying to control it.
COLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out
at the darkness.
Then looks at his SON again.
FERNANDO
won't give in to the sickness, but COLUMBUS knows he'd
feel better if he did.
COLUMBUS
How are you feeling, Fernando?
FERNANDO
(in a strangled
voice)
Not bad.
COLUMBUS nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke.
FERNANDO winces, gags slightly.
COLUMBUS
(almost casually)
You know what I always used to do?
FERNANDO shakes his head.
COLUMBUS
Swallow a piece of pork fat on a
string.
It always worked.
At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head
over the side, and vomits copiously.
COLUMBUS smiles,
pats him on the back.
SHIP'S DECK - DAY
As it plows through heavy seas.
COLUMBUS, a coat wrapped
around him, is sitting on a chair topside, directing
operations despite an obvious fever.
Suddenly a cry from the mast head:
SAILOR (O.S.)
Tierra...!
Tierra!
SAILORS and FERNANDO rush to the side of the ship, peering
through the spray.
FERNANDO wipes his eyes, and then he
sees it:
there in the distance, a speck of land.
FERNANDO and his FATHER stand together, watching the low
cloud formation sitting on the horizon.
COLUMBUS
The mainland...
FERNANDO looks excited.
Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his
SON, enjoying his happiness.
PANAMA (SURREAL IMAGES) - DAY
A most wonderful and surreal image.
A heavy mist lies
over the forest.
We move above it slowly.
A FIGURE emerges from the mist.
At first only a
silhouette -- then, slowly, a golden figure... an INDIAN,
covered in gold... gold artifacts, golden paste on his
body.
The GOLDEN FIGURE turns, and points, into an unknown
distance.
TREEHOUSE - DAY
From the INDIAN treehouse, COLUMBUS, FERNANDO, MENDEZ and
several INDIANS are gazing west over a necklace of
magnificent lakes.
The INDIANS point and talk gently.
FERNANDO has never
seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.
CAMP - SUNSET
A magnificent sunset.
A fire is burning, food cooking.
COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where
they are.
We see the outline of the continent of Asia.
An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at
the map.
Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a
piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the
map.
Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the
Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus.
MENDEZ and FERNANDO
gather round.
COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with
initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.
MENDEZ
What's he doing?
COLUMBUS
He's drawing an isthmus... He's
saying we're on an isthmus.
MENDEZ
We can't be.
FERNANDO is still confused.
The OLD INDIAN continues to
sketch, talking quietly all the time.
An INDIAN
TRANSLATOR listens.
COLUMBUS
Tell me what he's saying.
TRANSLATOR
He says -- water on the other side.
COLUMBUS
Ask him if he means a lake.
A big
lake.
The TRANSLATOR asks.
The OLD INDIAN shakes his head,
laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes,
emphatically.
TRANSLATOR
No.
Says those are lakes.
Water on
other side big -- as wide as here.
Above and below, much land.
COLUMBUS
(stunned)
An ocean...?
He's says it's an
ocean?
FERNANDO
I don't understand.
COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain.
The
INDIANS laugh.
Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on
the map, for his son.
COLUMBUS
Here is Europe... and over here, the
continent of Asia.
But there's
something in between!
Another
continent!
We've found... another
continent!
FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.
COLUMBUS
looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.
FERNANDO
Father...
COLUMBUS
There must be a passage to that
other ocean.
CUT TO:
MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT
We see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination.
We are
plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating,
giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer
and closer...
COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt.
Everything is silent.
COLUMBUS walks outside.
DECK - NIGHT
COLUMBUS' fever has subsided.
He raises his head and
stares at the mainland passing in the night.
He smiles.
CUT TO:
JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY
The roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at
anchor.
CUT TO:
RIVER - DAY
Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the
jungle.
JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY
Smoke rises lazily above the trees.
CUT TO:
The boats reaching the bank.
THE FIRST HUTS of a village.
THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village.
FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED
SOLDIERS enter one of the huts.
The remains of a meal is
still warm in bowls on the matted floor.
A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and
devours its contents:
some kind of stew.
Stepping back
accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar
behind him.
It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains
of meat marinating in liquid.
There is something
disturbing about the appearance of the content.
FERNANDO
Oh my God...
The remains of human beings.
COLUMBUS
(approaching)
What is...?
He stares at the remains, stunned.
THE SOLDIER stops
chewing.
He drops the half-empty bowl he was still
holding.
He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep
in the back of his throat, and vomits.
SOLDIER
Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de
Dios...
(Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of
God...)
But as he vomits and cries, he notices:
A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass.
Disturbed flies rise in clouds.
SOLDIER
Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...
(Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...)
CUT TO:
COLUMBUS and the SPANIARDS meet in the center of the
village.
All have made the same horrific discovery.
COLUMBUS
(urgently)
Out!
Get out!
THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed
at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.
They are running through the dense forest for the river
bank.
The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running
alongside.
Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their
brutal faces painted in black.
They release arrows at the
running SOLDIERS.
A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground,
fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but
he is pierced by a spear.
TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut
his throat to finish him.
ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDS
and CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.
A CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his
lance.
COLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his
abdomen.
Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who
collapses.
Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.
He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood.
Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at
it.
A GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody
fingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating
wings.
FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to
his feet.
They run...
CUT TO:
THE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running
hard to the boat.
ARROWS whistle around them as they leap
into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them
into the current.
SOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank.
But
the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.
SHIP AT SEA - DAY
Endless seascape, the caravel plowing.
SHIP'S DECK - DAY
FERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a
blanket.
He seems in a state of shock:
he is pale and
shaking.
As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands
him a flask of alcohol.
COLUMBUS
(kindly)
Take it.
Come on.
Drink.
As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO
notices that his hands are shaking too.
His FATHER'S
forehead is dripping with sweat.
FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces.
He drinks again and
hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same.
FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers.
COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.
COLUMBUS
I... I have to see Mendez.
Then, with sudden anger.
COLUMBUS
Your brother was right.
I should
have never taken you with me.
I'll
never forgive myself.
Never!
He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the
rail.
He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain,
as if they were burning.
FERNANDO scrambles to his feet
and rushes to him.
COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed
somewhere -- fever is eating him up.
COLUMBUS
Will you ever forgive me?
FERNANDO turns around for help.
COLUMBUS
Captain Mendez!
UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY
Around the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS,
a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS.
AROJAZ is mounting his
horse.
SANCHEZ is waiting for him.
COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the
CROWD.
CUT TO:
AROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ.
AROJAZ suddenly spots
COLUMBUS in the crowd, as they move off.
AROJAZ
My God...!
I thought he was dead.
They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS.
But he does not
see them.
SANCHEZ
You can see for yourself.
AROJAZ
What a tragedy... what a waste of a
life...
SANCHEZ
A waste...?
Let me tell you
something, Arojaz.
If your name, or
mine, is ever remembered -- it will
only be because of his.
AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his
neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN
THE CROWD.
LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY
ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a
siesta next to his grapes.
He is sitting in a simple
armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.
The presence of someone wakes him.
After a moment, he
recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.
Both MEN are very moved.
MARCHENA
I suppose we're both old men now.
COLUMBUS
You'll always be older than me,
Father.
They laugh.
COLUMBUS sits down.
Bees drone lazily in the
sunlight.
COLUMBUS
Have you ever forgiven me?
MARCHENA nods his head.
MARCHENA
Yes.
I forgave you a long time ago.
You see, I was proud of you.
You
were like a willful child.
You
wouldn't accept what others told
you.
You had to find things out for
yourself, hurting yourself -- and
others -- in the process.
MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.
MARCHENA
Do you remember when you said that
people talk about the world, but
never leave their gardens.
COLUMBUS nods.
MARCHENA
More than ever I wonder what it is
we do achieve by leaving our
gardens... The world changes -- and
yet it seems the same.
We find new
worlds, but fill them with the same
people...
He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently.
MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up
towards the sun.
COLUMBUS
I have to disagree.
MARCHENA
I knew you would.
COLUMBUS
New worlds create new people.
MARCHENA
Oh?
So you are a new man?
COLUMBUS
I don't know... I have the
impression that I didn't change that
much.
I still can't accept the
world as it is!
MARCHENA starts laughing.
MARCHENA
God bless you, and those like you!
They both laugh.
BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING
FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining
documents and letters.
COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl
around his legs.
He looks even older now, with his mass
of pure white hair.
BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a
decanter of water.
She places it on a small table near
COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.
As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her
back.
COLUMBUS
Can't you stay with us a little?
BEATRIX
I am busy inside.
He smiles.
She looks at him smiling, intrigued.
BEATRIX
What is it, now?
Tell me...
COLUMBUS
I can't keep my eyes off you.
I
would like to catch up with all the
moments I didn't spend with you.
FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and
slightly embarrassed.
COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake
air of reproach.
COLUMBUS
What are you listening to?
FERNANDO
I am not listening, Father.
But I
can't help hearing.
FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.
FERNANDO
It's Diego... He is at the Court,
with Santangel... He says they hope
to get your privileges restored...
And maybe the house.
COLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very
little importance to him now.
COLUMBUS
But how is he?
And Dona Maria?
FERNANDO continues to read.
FERNANDO
Fine, it seems.
Diego is thinking
of starting a pearl trade, in Santo
Domingo... He says he received many
letters for you.
Some of your men,
mostly.
He opens one of them, glances at it.
FERNANDO
This one is from Mendez!
COLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy.
COLUMBUS
What does he say?
FERNANDO
He asks when he can come to visit
you.
He left his address.
COLUMBUS
(smiling)
He never had one... except aboard my
ships!
FERNANDO laughs -- then, suddenly serious.
FERNANDO
I want you to tell me everything you
remember, Father.
From the
beginning.
Everything.
COLUMBUS
Really?
(pause)
God... I wouldn't know where to
start... and yet...
FERNANDO
Tell me the first thing that comes
to your mind.
COLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair.
His eyes are
fixed somewhere, searching.
Then, almost in a murmur.
COLUMBUS
I remember...
We see the page.
FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER...
A drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the
words.
FERNANDO is waiting.
CUT TO:
COLUMBUS' eyes.
CUT TO:
BEACH AND JUNGLE - FIRST LANDING - DAY
A MOVING IMAGE, as seen from the rolling deck of a ship.
We see:
A majestic forest, resting on a slash of white sand, and
deep blue sea...
MUSIC BEGINS:
THE LONE SILHOUETTE of an INDIAN emerges from the dense
foliage.
He runs down the beach towards the surf.
He
stops and seems to be staring at us.
These words appear on the screen:
THE BIOGRAPHY FERNANDO WROTE ABOUT
