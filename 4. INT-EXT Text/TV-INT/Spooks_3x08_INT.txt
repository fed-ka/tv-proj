        photographs: there is a young woman in a hotel room, 
      laughing; she is taking off her blouse, poking out her tongue 
      at the camera, she is naked in the bed sheets twirled around 
      her.  

      The man holding the mobile is JOHN SYLVESTER.  He is a middle-
      aged man, raddled but handsome.  He is weeping.  He puts the 
      mobile down beside a piece of House Of Commons writing paper 
      and a pen.  

      CLOSE UP:  He picks up the pen and writes  Dear Prime 
      Minister  ...

      The Security Guard - trouser-less - stands.  The Young Woman 
      tries to keep him on the floor but he looks at the monitors

      One shows the nursery.  The window has been opened.  The cot 
      is empty.  He stares.  He hits an alarm.

      He is shaking with fear.  The Young Woman is behind him.  She 
      looks at him with loathing and runs from the room.

      B advances towards the cot and sinks to her knees.  Her face

      Heavy curtains are still drawn.  A desk lamp is on.

      John Sylvester is in shirt sleeves.  The bottle of whisky is 
      almost empty.  He is asleep at his desk, head on the blotter.  

      He starts and wakes.  He gets to his feet.  He goes to the 
      curtains and pulls them.  Daylight floods into the room.  He 
      squints.

      Adam arrives.  It is a small, discreet restaurant with all 
      the indications of a very pricey menu.

      MICHELLE MOLBY is sitting in a corner at a table for two.  
      She is thirty-something, very well dressed, long hair, sun 
      tanned, carefully make up.  There is a golden hue about her.

      She sees Adam and smiles.  He joins her.

      On a bench there is a magnificent rectangular case in white 
      leather and chrome.

      There is a wonderful array of make up products and devices in

      Harry pulls him up violently and drags him across the room to 
      the desk.  Sylvester sits.  Harry sets House of Commons 
      notepaper and the pen before him.

      Sylvester has written a paragraph.  He signs it.  Harry gives 
      him an envelope.  He puts the letter in it.  Harry takes the 
      envelope.

                                  HARRY 
                    I will put this in the internal 
                    mail for you.


      He lifts the desk telephone phone and sets it before 
      Sylvester.

                    And now perhaps you d like to help

      Harry leaves without a sound.  Sylvester, shaking with fear, 
      looks at the telephone.  He slumps forward, puts his head on 
      the table and blacks out.

      Sylvester wakes with a start.  Oliver Mace is standing behind 
      him.

                    Do you Spooks walk through doors or 
                    what?

      Mace puts the letter of resignation, opened, on the desk.

      Fiona closes the door and locks it.  Fiona is speedy.  Her 
      nose starts to bleed.

      She does so.  He pulls out tissues for her.  She throws her 
      head back.

                                  FIONA
                    She did it, not him.  He s

                    The way she reacts, everything s

                    kid down in a bag.  Then when they 
                    get the kid back the nation will 
                    rejoice.

                                  FIONA 
                    It s the only way to stay with her.

                    I m taking an antidote.

                    I can handle it.

      Fiona lets Adam into the house.  A very hurried conversation.  
      Adam has his back to the staircase.  


                                  ADAM
                    The obbo van s in the street, back

      Adam gives her miniature electronic equipment.  She puts it

                            him.)
                    Get your hands off!

      Out of the blue Fiona hits him in the face.  He turns away.  
      She kicks him in the stomach.  Fiona had seen B appear on the 
      stair.

                                  FIONA (cont d)
                    Bastard.

      B is coming down the stairs at speed on very high heels.

                                  B
                     Pawed ?  I ll give him  pawed. 

      B reaches him and gives him a kick with her pointed shoe.

      Fiona has fixed the wire to her waist.  She checks the
