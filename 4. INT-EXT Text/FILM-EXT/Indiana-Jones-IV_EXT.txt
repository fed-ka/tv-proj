The Mastiff FALLS. Flying hundreds of feet into the ROCKY WATERS
BELOW. The hound's vicious howl FADES. CAMERA PANS from the water and
STOPS ON INDIANA JONES! Indy has OUTSMARTED the Mastiff. Be HANGS onto
the swinging WINDOW FRAME. SAFE. He LEAPS back inside the room.
The villagers SURROUND the castle. Their BRIGHT TORCHES are raised
high in the air. Baron Seagrove is LED out of the castle by Indiana
and the Police. The crowd begins to WHISPER. ANXIOUS. EXCITED. As the
Baron is led to the POLICE VEHICLE, he turns and LOOKS at Indy. The
Baron speaks in a TREMBLING, RASPY voice. His eyes are WILD.
BARON SEAGROVE
No...jail...can...hold...me.
A CHILL rushes through Indiana. The Baron turns, CONTINUING to the
Police wagon. One of the villagers SHOUTS.
VILLAGER
'E's done it! Indiana Jones has
captured the killer!
The crowd CHEERS. Indiana gives a HUMBLE NOD and WAVE. MacGowan SHAKES
Indy's hand. Indy glances to the POLICE VEHICLE.
INDY'S POV
Baron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle.
Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through
the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the
MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a
GHOST!
Indiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious
that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE
expression on Indy's face.
MACGOWAN
What is it, man? You look as if
you've seen a screamin' banshee!
Indy POINTS back to the police vehicle. But it has already DEPARTED.
It drives over a far hill, DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT. Indy SIGHS,
turning back to MacGowan.
INDIANA
Ah... It was nothing, Mac. Nothing
at all.
CAMERA DOLLIES INTO INDIANA'S TROUBLED, UNCERTAIN FACE. THE BARON'S
LAUGH FILLS THE SOUND TRACK.
SLOW DISSOLVE:
Early AFTERNOON. A RAINY Spring day. Students RUN to the University
doors, protecting themselves with textbooks.
Chief PORT on the coast. Gateway to the ZAMBESI RIVER. SUPPLY SHIPS,
SAILBOATS and RAFTS line the marina. The docks are crowded with
various MERCHANTS and SAILORS, unloading their goods. Small SHOPS and
RESTAURANTS clutter the waterfront. Behind them are rows of one story,
low square HOMES. Tall, healthy PALM TREES surround the Area.
An OCEAN LINER has anchored along the shore. Several PASSENGERS exit
from the ship. INDIANA steps onto the ocean liner's exit ramp. He is
UNSHAVEN, wearing his traditional LEATHER JACKET and HAT. Indy LOOKS
AROUND, expecting to MEET someone.
INDY'S POV - THE DOCK
There is a a LOUD CAR HORN. Crowds of pedestrians LEAP out of the way.
A rusted, yellow MODEL-T barrels along the rickety dock. The word
"TAXI" is crudely painted on the car's trembling doors. The car's
tires are WOBBLING. LOOSE. Thick, black SMOKE pours from the cracked
EXHAUST PIPE. The ancient car RATTLES and GRINDS.
Upon seeing the car, Indiana SMILES.
At the foot of the ocean liner's ramp, the car SCREECHES TO A STOP!
SCRAGGY BRIER
Indiana's friend and guide, JUMPS out of the taxi. Scraggy is a rough,
unkempt AFRICAN MAN. An elderly fellow, with the ENERGY and VITALITY
of a youth. His snow white hair and beard are WILD. SPIKED. He wears
TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY
body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet.
Scraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy
SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy
stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before
him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS
into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with
a Portugese accent, Scraggy EXCLAIMS...
SCRAGGY
Indy! At last we are reunited!
(looks to sky)
Oh, Keechingo, God Of Friendship...I
thank you for granting my wish!
Indy RESTS Scraggy back onto the ramp. Scraggy MOVES to assist Indiana
with his luggage. Before picking it up, Scraggy RAISES his arms over
the baggage. Again, he BLESSES the suitcases. Scraggy then PICKS UP
the bags. Indy CHUCKLES.
INDIANA
I see you haven't changed, Scraggy.
SCRAGGY
Mahootmek, God Of Goodness, say...
"Before body make contact with
foreign object...one must cast out
bad spirits, or -- "
INDIANA
" -- or bad spirits will enter your
body!"
SCRAGGY
Yes! You have excellent memory,
Indy.
INDIANA
I should! Last time we saw each
other...you made me wear the same
clothes for 3 weeks straight.
SCRAGGY
Never separate body from clothes, or
bad spirits will hide in pockets!
INDIANA
In other words... If people never
changed clothes...there would be no
evil in the world.
SCRAGGY
Exactly!
INDIANA
(chuckles, puts his arm
around Scraggy)
I missed all a' your crazy
philosophies, Scraggy.
SCRAGGY
They not so crazy, Indy.
(serious, eyes wide with
fear)
These days... There is much evil in
the air. I feel it. Everywhere.
Indy and Scraggy CONTINUE to walk down the ramp, moving OFF SCREEN.
CAMERA PANS TO A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM. CAMERA STOPS, as the SCREEN IS
FILLED WITH A LARGE, BLAZING RED SWASTIKA! CAMERA PANS UPWARD. We see
that this is the SLEEVE OF A GERMAN SOLDIER. CAMERA STOPS on the face
of
SGT. HELMUT GUTTERBUHG
A thin, skeletal NAZI. He resembles the ANGEL OF DEATH. Gutterbuhg's
face is NARROW and SUNKEN. His deep set eyes are a frightening LIGHT
BLUE. His complexion is PALE. EMOTIONLESS. His hair is BLONDE.
STRINGY. His right arm appears RIGID. It rests STIFFLY at his side.
Gutterbuhg FOLLOWS Indy and Scraggy through the crowd. The Nazi
REMOVES something from his pocket. It is a tiny, MECHANICAL ITEM. It
resembles a COCKROACH. We see that it is a mini RADIO TRANSMITTER.
Gutterbuhg WHISPERS into it.
GUTTERBUHG
(German, English
subtitles)
Are we making contact?
The mechanical roach's eyes BLINK RED. Gutterbuhg gives a CHILLING
SMILE.
Meanwhile, Indiana and Scraggy ARRIVE at the Taxi. Scraggy begins to
SECURE Indy's baggage to the roof. Indy OPENS the rear door of the
cab. He begins to CLIMB into the back seat. He is met with a SWIFT
KICK TO THE STOMACH! He FALLS to the ground. The wind KNOCKED out of
him. Scraggy RUNS to the open door, scolding the person INSIDE.
SCRAGGY
Dr. Clarke! Why you kick Dr.
Jones?...
DR. CLARE CLARKE
STEPS OUT of the shadows of the car. We RECOGNIZE her from Marcus'
film, but she is even MORE BEAUTIFUL in person. She is the SAME AGE as
Indy. Her hair is BRIGHT RED. She removes her glasses, revealing
sparkling GREEN EYES. She is very PRIM. Very PROPER. But extremely
INTELLIGENT and QUICK WITTED. She is dressed in KHAKI SLACKS and
SHIRT. She speaks in a slight BRITISH ACCENT. She hurriedly ASSISTS
Indiana to his feet.
CLARE
Dr. Jones! Forgive me.
INDIANA
No sweat.
CLARE
Thought I was being attacked by a
degenerate sailor.
INDIANA
No. Just a degenerate archeologist.
CLARE
Your appearance is deceiving.
INDIANA
Likewise.
They exchange a handshake and a SMILE. Immediately ATTRACTED to each
other.
PORTER (O.S.)
Indiana Jones! Calling passenger
Indiana Jones!
Indiana TURNS. A ship PORTER walks through the crowd, pushing a LARGE
BARREL on a dolly. Indy WAVES to the Porter. The Porter STOPS in front
of him.
PORTER
You left this aboard ship.
INDIANA
(puzzled)
There must be some mistake... I
didn't --
The Porter POINTS to a section of the barrel that reads: DELIVER TO:
DR. INDIANA JONES.
PORTER
That's you, ain't it?
INDIANA
Well, yeah...but...
The Porter DROPS the barrel in front of Indiana and hurriedly WALKS
back to the ship.
SGT. GUTTERBUHG continues to SPY on Indiana. The Nazi HIDES a few feet
away. In a DARK alleyway.
A puzzled Indiana begins to OPEN the barrel. Scraggy SHOUTS a warning.
SCRAGGY
Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of
Goodness! "Before body make contact
with foreign object -- "
Indiana IGNORES Scraggy and begins to PRY OPEN the barrel.
SCRAGGY
"...you must cast out bad spirits!"
Indiana still IGNORES Scraggy. He STRUGGLES with the barrel top,
FLIRTING with Clare.
INDIANA
May I call you "Clare"?
CLARE
Please.
INDIANA
Well, Clare... We've obviously got a
lot of notes to compare... Let's get
started tonight...over dinner.
CLARE
I'd like that very much.
INDIANA
Friend of mine owns a Cafe... He'll
get us a nice quiet table. No
disturbances. Just the two of us --
At that moment, the barrel lid FLIES OFF! The inside if FILLED with
old, brown BANANA PEELS. Suddenly, BETSY'S HEAD POKES THROUGH the
peels! Indiana is SHOCKED. Scraggy SIGHS.
SCRAGGY
I warn you, Indy! You must always
cast out bad spirits!
A dirty, unkempt Betsy LEAPS OUT OF THE BARREL! She THROWS her arms
around Indy.
BETSY
My precious!
CLARE
(puzzled, to Indy)
Your daughter?
INDIANA
My assistant.
BETSY
His girlfriend.
CLARE
(revolted)
A child!
INDIANA
(to Clare)
It's nothing. Really.
(to Betsy)
What the hell are you doing here'?
BETSY
Proving my love for you.
CLARE
How terribly sordid.
INDIANA
(to Clare)
Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She'll
get over it.
BETSY
Never. This proves that nothing can
come between us. Not an ocean. Not
two separate Continents.
CLARE
Think I'm going to be ill.
INDIANA
(puzzled, to Betsy)
How...I mean... How could you stay
alive?
BETSY
Hey... I'm from Brooklyn.
INDIANA
But we'ye been sailing for three
weeks!
BETSY
Stowed away in the banana barrel.
Ate my way to the bottom.
CLARE
(nauseous)
Charming.
BETSY
(pointing to Clare)
Hey, Indy... Who's the babe?
CLARE
Your intellectual and emotional
superior.
BETSY
Yeah...well you're gettin' on my
nerves, Miss... Miss...
CLARE
(extends her hand)
"Doctor" Clare Clarke.
BETSY
(reluctantly shaking
Clare's hand)
Betsy Tuffet...
CLARE
As in curds and whey?
BETSY
(getting tough)
Listen, sister... You better stay
away from Indy...
CLARE
My dear, he has no interest in me.
I've already celebrated my tenth
Birthday.
Indiana SHOOTS Clare an angry glance. Indy removes a wad of BILLS from
his pocket. He GIVES them to Betsy.
INDIANA
Look, Betsy... Why don't you get
back on the boat... This time, as a
passenger.
SCRAGGY
Too late, Indy.
Scraggy points toward the OCEAN LINER. The boat is SEVERAL FEET from
shore. It SAILS back out to sea. Indiana STEAMS.
INDIANA
When's the next one out?
SCRAGGY
Two weeks.
Indiana GRUMBLES. An amused Dr. Clarke gets back into the car. Indy
SHOVES Betsy inside. He is FURIOUS.
Before Indiana gets into the car, GUTTERBUHG steps out from the
alleyway. He TOSSES the tiny mechanical COCKROACH at Indiana. The
roach ATTACHES itself to Indy's TROUSER LEG. The tiny transmittor is
very LIGHT. Indiana can feel NOTHING. He gets INTO the car. Scraggy
BLESSES the Taxi and gets into the driver's seat.
Gutterbuhg WATCHES as the battered Model-T DRIVES OFF. The NAZI turns,
walking in an opposite direction. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Gutterbuhg, as he
enters a SEEDY WATERFRONT HOTEL.
A miniature ZOO. The PEACEFUL compound is surrounded with small man
made lakes and palm trees. There are countless METAL CAGES, filled
with various ANIMALS. The TIGERS, LIONS, GORILLAS and other violent
creatures, are kept BEHIND BARS. But the LLAMAS, GIRAFFES, DEER and
various tame animals are FREE to roam the compound grounds.
Indiana ENTERS with Clare, Betsy and Scraggy. The persistant Betsy is
ANNOYING Indy. She attempts to SNUGGLE closer to him. Indiana PUSHES
her away. Betsy TRIES to hold his hand. Indy SHAKES her loose. Scraggy
WATCHES all of this, GIGGLING to himself.
We hear SINGING. A high, pitched BEAUTIFUL VOICE. Clare walks to the
far end of the compound, toward the SINGING. The others FOLLOW. Betsy
walks by BONZO, A LARGE CHIMPANZEE. As Betsy PASSES, the chimp catches
a FAMILIAR SMELL. Bonzo begins to FOLLOW Betsy.
Clare OPENS the door of a large metal cage. Here, the singing is
LOUDER. Clare ENTERS the cage. Indiana FOLLOWS. Scraggy BLESSES the
cage, then enters. Betsy MOVES to go inside, but Bonzo's LARGE HAIRY
HAND REACHES OUT and GRABS BETSY! PULLING the girl OFF SCREEN!
Bonzo is being extremely AFFECTIONATE toward Betsy. The chimpanzee
PULLS and GRABS at Betsy. It is all VERY SIMILIAR to what Betsy has
been doing to Indiana. Betsy WRESTLES with Bonzo, CALLING Indy for
help.
DARK. SILENT. Many of the animals are ASLEEP in their cages. A
SECURITY GUARD keeps watch on the compound. He STANDS outside of the
METAL GATES. There is a SUDDEN SOUND. The guard TURNS.
THE FIGURES OF THREE MEN stand before him. In the SHADOWS. The NERVOUS
Guard places a hand on his holster.
GUARD
Who's there?...
We hear a MECHANICAL CREAK. A MAN'S LEATHER GLOVED HAND extends from
the shadows. The hand's FINGER is POINTED at the Security GUARD.
CLOSE UP: VARIOUS ANIMALS
The sound of RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE echoes throughout the camp! CAMERA
RECORDS the animal's SHOCKED REACTIONS!
THE SECURITY GUARD
lies on the GROUND. DEAD. His body riddled with BULLETS. The SHINY,
BLACK BOOTS of the three men PASS his body. We notice that one of the
boot's SHOELACES are untied.
TYKI
STARES into the dark night. FEAR covers his face. He is SEATED inside
of his cage. A CANDLE flickers beside him. Tyki's hands REST on the
beautiful tapestry. Tyki LISTENS. He hears FOOTSTEPS. COMING toward
his cage. Tyki REACHES to his side. He grabs a STONE DAGGER.
Suddenly, a LOOD GONSHOT! The SPLINTERED LOCK from Tyki's cage goes
spinning across the floor. The cage door CREAKS OPEN.
GUTTERBUHG stands in the doorway. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS, HELMUT and KLACE
(who we met earlier), are beside him. Gutterbuhg SMILES. His stiff
right arm EXTENDS from his side. His leather gloved INDEX FINGER is
POINTING ahead.
Tyki GROWLS at the Nazis. He STANDS. RAISING the stone dagger OVER HIS
HEAD.
Gutterbuhg's FINGER BEGINS TO RAPIDLY FIRE BULLETS! His MECHANICAL ARM
is actually a A MACEINE GUN!
The bullets TEAR through Tyki's tapestry. They make a crooked,
tattered line through the BEAUTIFOL WORK. DESTROYING it. A terrified
Tyki WATCHES.
Gutterbuhg STOPS shooting. He REMOVES the empty cartridge from a SLOT
in his mechanical arm, and REPLACES it with another. He points the
DEADLY FINGER at Tyki. A trembling Tyki DROPS the dagger. The three
NAZIS walk toward the helpless pygmy.
CUT TO:
Located on the WATERFRONT. Countless rows of LONG, WOODEN DOCKS line
the marina. The Nazis run to below a ROTTED, ANCIENT DOCK. Here, one
of their SPEEDBOATS waits. Motor RUNNING. RUDOLPH, a pudgy Nazi, is at
the wheel. The Nazis hurriedly CLIMB into the speedboat, PUSHING Tyki
inside with them.
Indy RUNS to Scraggy's Model-T. Scraggy SITS in the driver's seat.
Betsy and Clare SIT in the rear. A drunk Betsy still sings "Night and
Day". Indy leaps onto the SIDEBOARD. He SEES the Nazis ahead, CLIMBING
into the speedboat. Indy motions for Scraggy to DRIVE. FAST. TOWARD
the dock.
The Nazi speedboat SHOOTS FORWARD. Moving BENEATH the dock.
Scraggy's Model-T FOLLOWS ABOVE, along the SHAKY dock. Indiana RIDES
the car's rusted sideboard. He SEES the speedboat below, through the
WIDE OPENINGS in the dock's slated boards. Indy begins to SHOOT at the
Nazis. Gutterbuhg raises his mechanical arm, FIRING SHOTS back at
Indiana.
Machine gun fire SPLINTERS the dock boards, SLICING through the
Model-T. The side mirror is BLASTED to pieces. The floor beneath Betsy
and Clare erupts with FLYING BULLETS. JUST MISSING the girls. Clare is
HORRIFIED. Betsy laughs HYSTERICALLY.
The Model-T is less than TWENTY FEET from the end of the dock. If they
continue ahead, the car will PLUNGE SEVERAL FEET INTO THE WATER! But
Scraggy doesn't take his FOOT from the gas.
GUTTERBUHG smiles, seeing the vast ocean ahead. Knowing he's almost
FREE.
As he DODGES bullets, Indiana SEES the end of the dock ahead. He
SHOUTS to Scraggy.
INDIANA
When I tell you... Hit the brakes!
Scraggy NODS. The end of the dock is only a FEW FEET ahead. Getting
CLOSER... CLOSER... Clare COVERS her eyes. Between hiccups, Betsy
laughingly SINGS. Indy LOOKS to the speedboat... BACK to the
approaching dock edge... He PAUSES... WAITING for the right moment...
He SCREAMS!
INDIANA
Now, Scraggy!
Scraggy's foot SLAMS ON THE BRAKES! The sudden jolt sends Indy FLYING
INTO THE AIR!
The speedboat SHOOTS OUT from beneath the dock! Indiana LANDS DIRECTLY
ON TOP OF THE SPEEDBOAT! A SPECTACULAR STUNT!
Helmut POINTS his gun at Indy. Indy reacts with a SWIFT KICK to
Helmut's jaw. The Nazi HITS the deck. OUT COLD. Klaus COMES for Indy.
They begin to FIGHT. An angry Gutterbuhg tries to SHOOT... But Indy
and Klaus move TOO QUICKLY! Gutterbuhg CAN'T get a clear shot.
The Model-T has COME TO A STOP. SAFE. Its front wheels TEETER over the
dock's edge. Scraggy, Betsy and Clare GET OUT. Clare CATCHES her
breath. Knees SHAKING. Betsy is still LAUGHING.
BETSY
About time we had some fun!
A WORRIED Scraggy sees Indiana, FIGHTING with the Nazis.
SCRAGGY
Bad spirits have Indy! He in
trouble! Big trouble!
Scraggy RUNS OFF SCREEN.
The Nazi speedboat is HEADED TOWARD THE SIDE OF AN ENORMOUS OCEAN
LINER! Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to
FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki
watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS.
The speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the
Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER!
UNDERWATER
Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet
from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers
create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER...
toward a SPINNING DEATH.
Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their
bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a
switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with
the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the
propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana...
But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace
CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE
PROPELLERS!
Indiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD
surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to
safety.
ABOVE WATER
Indiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front
of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES
GOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY.
Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A
SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES.
GUTTERBUHG
Goodnight, Doctor Jones.
There is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A
BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound.
Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS.
DASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a
sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell
points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT...
With a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF
DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat.
DASHIELL
Scraggy said you might be needing
some help, sport.
Dashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis.
A FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the
ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE
around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK
SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths
are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the
darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD
of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and
SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.)
Throughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange
GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine
gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO
Nazi headquarters for help.
Dashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY
SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut
AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two
FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN
the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING.
Up ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the
speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS.
DASHIELL
Indy! Rollout!
Indy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat.
Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut
tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into
the pole! CRUSHED!
Dashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana.
DASHIELL
You okay, sport?
Indiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING. AHEAD. He SCREAMS.
INDIANA
Dash!...
Dashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID
WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE.
The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the
warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck.
The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat
BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air.
Early MORNING. The sparkling waters of the Zambesi are lined by thick
JUNGLE. Sounds of screeching GIBBONS, exotic BIRDS, chattering
INSECTS, and various other WILDLIFE echo from the jungle. BRIGHT RAYS
of HOT sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm
trees.
A 55 foot, tattered, wooden RIVER BOAT, the "ADOBO", travels along the
Zambesi. The boat is filled with various crates and barrels of
SUPPLIES. And there are several men, CREW MEMBERS, all natives of
Mozambique. They are a MOTLEY crew, all armed with SWORDS and DAGGERS.
They are DIRTY. TATTERED. UNKEMPT. The boat pulls a long, WOODEN RAFT
behind it. Scraggy's MODEL-T is attached to the raft. One of the crew
members, a YOUNG MAN, sits on the raft. He strums a BEATEN GUITAR,
singing a FOLK SONG.
INDIANA stands at the ship's steering wheel. Forehead COVERED with
sweat. He GUIDES the ship along the twisting waters. CLARE exits from
a cabin, carrying a stenographer's NOTEBOOK. She looks RADIANT. Her
red hair SHIMMERS in the morning sun. Clare walks up BESIDE Indy. She
CRINKLES her nose.
CLARE
What is that awful aroma?
INDIANA
Scraggy's takin' a shower.
Indy points OFF SCREEN. Scraggy, fully clothed, STANDS here. He rubs a
large, FRESH ONION over his FACE, ARMS and LEGS. SQUEEZING the onion
JUICE over his body. Indiana EXPLAINS to a befuddled Clare.
INDIANA
He believes that onions keep bad
spirits from entering his body.
CLARE
(writing in her
notebook)
In all my years of anthropology...
I've never run across anyone or
anything quite like Scraggy.
INDIANA
(chuckles)
He's a rare breed.
(turns, looks at Clare
for the first time)
You're looking very lovely.
CLARE
You're looking very lecherous.
INDIANA
(turns away, angry)
Just tryin' to be friendly.
CLARE
Save it for the schoolgirls.
INDIANA
Look, Clare... Betsy's just an
anxious archeology student...she
admires my work...
(egotistical shrug)
Who can blame her?...
(back to his point)
But it's just some kinda' hero
worship thing...
There was never any romance.
BETSY
(pops in from OFF
SCREEN, kisses Indiana)
I dreamed about our first night
together!
Indy SIGHS. Clare DISGUSTINGLY shakes her head. She continues to
scrawl more into her notebook. Indiana gives her a STARTLED look.
INDIANA
You're writin' this down?...
CLARE
(nods)
I'm keeping an accurate record of
our journey.
INDIANA
What's that got to do with my
personal life?
CLARE
Evidence. I plan on testifying at
your child molestation trial.
Indiana SHAKES his head. STARING into the distance. He SIGHS.
INDIANA
Why do I do this to myself?
Holding her head in PAIN, Betsy turns to Clare.
BETSY
(holds her head in pain,
to Clare)
Hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a
Doctor...you got any cures for a
hangover?...
CLARE
The best I've heard was used by a
New Zealand Tribe...
(pauses, thinking)
One part crushed owl skull...two
parts rhino saliva...one part zebra
dandruff.
Betsy's face becomes PALE. Indy INTERRUPTS.
INDIANA
No, No... Get a cup of donkey sweat
...two spoons of skunk hair...and
one pint of shredded lizard tongue.
Betsy turns a light shade of GREEN. Scraggy ARGUES.
SCRAGGY
I always use family cure! Two spoons
chopped leeches... Half cup horse
mucous...two quarts crocodile urine!
BETSY
(ready to throw up)
Ex...cuse...me...!
Betsy runs OFF SCREEN. The others exchange a SHRUG. Scraggy LOOKS at
the river ahead.
SCRAGGY
How far we travel, Indy?...
INDIANA
Almost 20 miles.
CLARE
Any sign of the Nazis?
INDIANA
(shakes his head,
confident)
Long as we keep up this pace...
they'll have trouble tracking us.
CAMERA PANS from the hopeful faces of Indiana, Scraggy and Clare, to
the CABIN behind them. Here, a CREW MEMBER HIDES in the shadows. His
face HIDDEN. He HOLDS a small radio receiver. He WHISPERS into the
receiver. Speaking in perfect GERMAN.
CUT TO:
GUTTERBUBG.
He is seated in NAZI HEADQUARTERS. He repairs his detached, MACHINE
GUN ARM, which sits on the table before him. Behind Gutterbuhg, a
GROUP OF NAZIS listen to the radio transmission of Scraggy's
treacherous Crew Member, who discloses the LOCATION of the River Boat.
The Nazis CHART out the boat's exact location on a large, WALL MAP.
LIEUT. MEPHISTO supervises the project. Tyki, BOUND, GAGGED and
BRUISED, watches from a corner. MEPHISTO looks at all the Nazis.
MEPHISTO
(German, English
subtitles)
We must leave. Immediately.
DISSOLVE TO:
NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE.
VARIOUS SHOTS of exotic animals. A creeping PANTHER. A sleeping WHITE
BAT. A tense SCORPION. A family of CROCODILES.
ABOARD SHIP
Indiana, Scraggy, Clare and Betsy are GATHERED on the deck. Seated in
a CIRCLE. They are surrounded by the CREW MEMBERS. Everyone eats their
DINNER from tin cans. The surrounding lanterns cast an EERIE LIGHT on
the area. The young crew member plays a soft, SPOOKY tune on his
guitar. Betsy is RESTLESS. She GLARES at the guitar player.
BETSY
Don't you know somethin' else?
Somethin' upbeat?...
The guitar player IGNORES Betsy, continuing to play. Betsy SIGHS.
UPSET. BORED.
BETSY
It's so hot... Stuffy... Do we have
to stay on this stupid boat all
night?...
INDIANA
(nods)
We have to keep moving.
BETSY
Can we at least jump in the
water?... Go for a swim?...
CLARE
There's an old legend about the
Zambesi... In ancient times,
criminals were given their choice of
execution...or swimming across the
Zambesi. Most chose execution.
INDIANA
Clare's right. We'll be safer on the
boat.
(annoyed, to Betsy)
Now quit moanin' and eat your food.
An angry Betsy TOSSES her tin can overboard. She STANDS. FURIOUS with
Indiana.
BETSY
You are so rude! I travel thousands
of miles just to be with you...and
everybody treats me like dirt!
(to Clare)
Nobody even talks to me without
making some condescending remark
they think I'm too stupid to
understand!
(very upset)
So maybe I don't know a lot about
weird tribal dances... I'm still
pretty good with anthropology and
archeology... Maybe I could even
help you out...if somebody gave me a
chance...clued me in to what it is
we're doin' here...
(to Indy)
'Cause whether you like it or not,
Indiana Jones... I'm part of this
expedition, too!
Clare RAISES an eyebrow. IMPRESSED. Indiana says NOTHING. He can't
ARGUE. Scraggy INTERJECTS.
SCRAGGY
(motions to crew
members)
My friends also curious about where
we journey to, Indy.
The crew members NOD. STARING at Indiana. Indiana turns to Clare. She
SMILES.
CLARE
Tell us all a bedtime story, Doctor
Jones.
Indiana SIGHS. The crew member's GUITAR PLAYING COMBINES with the
SOUND TRACK, backing up Indiana's story with an EERIE TUNE.
INDIANA
Long ago...a place known as the
Flower Fruit Mountain, in the
Chinese province of Ao-Lai...was
struck by lightning. A Stone Monkey,
"Sun Wu-Kung", was born.
SCRAGGY
This monkey?... He could walk?...
Talk?... Like human?...
INDIANA
More than human. He was blessed with
countless heavenly powers... But it
wasn't enough. Sun Wu-Kung wanted to
learn the secret of Eternal Life...
of Immortality...
(pause)
Equipped with his Golden Hooped Rod
to protect him, Sun Wu Kung
travelled the world for many years
...learning the secret philosophies
and teachings of Eternal Youth.
Eventually, he was granted entrance
to heaven...where the Jade Emperor
gave Sun Wu Kung the title of "Great
Sage of the Heavens"...and permitted
him to oversee the Garden of
Immortal Peaches.
(pause)
After several years, the stone
monkey returned to somewhere on
earth. Here, he ruled an empire...a
Civilization of Monkeys and humans
who had life spans of many hundred
years...
(shrugs)
The exact whereabouts of that Lost
City has been a mystery for hundreds
of years...until Doctor Clarke
discovered the pygmy.
The crew members, Scraggy, Betsy and Clare, listen with FASCINATION.
INDIANA
It's uncertain just how much of this
legend is based in reality...
Nevertheless, we're hoping to find
some sign of the Lost Civilization.
BETSY
What about Sun Wu Kung?...
INDIANA
Whatever he was...a stone idol...an
actual monkey...a human being...is
unknown. But he is one of the most
influentual religious figures in
History, and his remains are most
likely somewhere in the Lost City.
Suddenly, they are INTERRUPTED BY A DISTANT SOUND. A LOW, RUMBLING
SOUND. BIZARRE. UNEARTHLY. UNLIKE anything we've heard before. Indiana
TURNS to Scraggy.
INDIANA
Sound familiar?
SCRAGGY
(shakes his head)
It is far, far away...many miles...
BETSY
(frightened)
What is it?... Some kinda' weird
animal?...
CLARE
No animal sounds like that.
SCRAGGY
Could be "Banseebaba".
CLARE
Banseebaba?
SCRAGGY
Banseebaba is giant demon from hell.
He is 50 feet tall. Breathes fire.
Make sound like human never hear
before. He is made up of all evil in
the world!
CLARE
Cheery thought.
The sound suddenly STOPS. Everyone exchanges a FRIGHTENED, TERRIFIED
GLANCE. Indiana STANDS.
INDIANA
Whatever the hell it is... It went
to sleep for the night. Which is
what we should do.
CUT TO:
LATER THAT NIGHT - LONG SHOT - THE BOAT
The boat sails along the RIVER. Beneath the MOONLIGHT. A lone CREW
MEMBER stays awake. At the STEERING WHEEL. Other CREW MEMBERS sleep
along the deck. Scraggy SLEEPS in a hanging cot.
INDIANA
is ASLEEP in his CABIN. Suddenly, the door SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN. A
SHADOW appears on the cabin wall. COMING TOWARD Indiana. The shadow
EXTENDS a hand. The hand GRABS Indy's blanket. Indy WAKES. He LEAPS
out of bed and TACKLES the mysterious person. Indy FLIPS on the cabin
lamp. The intruder is none other than...BETSY. Indiana PULLS Betsy to
her feet. She gives a flirtatious SMILE.
BETSY
Couldn't sleep. The heat. I'm in the
mood for passion.
INDIANA
I'm in the mood for isolation.
Indiana LEADS Betsy to the open door. He begins to PUSH her back
outside. Betsy STOPS him.
BETSY
I'm not leaving. Not till I get a
kiss.
INDIANA
Betsy...
BETSY
(serious)
One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear.
I'll wake the whole boat.
Indiana has NO CHOICE. He SIGHS.
INDIANA
OKay. Just one.
(leans toward her,
pauses)
Keep your mouth closed.
They KISS. Betsy WRAPS her arms around Indiana, turning it into a
PASSIONATE KISS.
At that moment, ACROSS THE HALL, Clare exits the bathroom, TOOTHBRUSH
in hand. She SEES the kissing Indiana and Betty. Clare STARES. OPEN
MOUTHED. SHOCKED. Indiana OPENS his eyes. He SEES Clare WATCHING HIM.
An ANGRY Clare MARCHES into her room. She SLAMS the door. WE HEAR
Clare LOCKING the door behind her, and moving a piece of furniture in
front of the door. Indiana PUSHES Betsy away. ANGRY. He quickly CLOSES
his door. Betsy WALKS back to her room. A huge, SATISFIED SMILE covers
her face.
THE FOLLOWING MORNING
SUNRISE. PEACEFUL. CALM. Birds SING. The River Boat has travelled
countless miles, into the heart of the ZAMBESI. A tired CREW MEMBER
mans the boat's steering wheel. CAMERA PANS DOWN, moving along the
side of the boat. WE STOP AT WATER LEVEL. A HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE
WATER. GRIPPING a rusted, sharp KNIFE. Followed by ANOTHER HAND. And
ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Until there are COUNTLESS HANDS, REACHING FOR
THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BOAT. The hands GRAB HOLD of the boat. SEVERAL
DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their
bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP
the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY.
Indiana stands on the REAR DECK, shirt WRAPPED around his waist. He is
SHAVING. CLARE sits a few feet away. WRITING in her journal. Indy
GLANCES to her. CURIOUS.
INDIANA
What's that you're writing?...
CLARE
"The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana
Jones, Professor Of Perversity".
INDIANA
(back to shaving)
Very funny.
CAMERA PANS TO THE FRONT DECK. STOPPING on the DRIVER. He STARES
ahead. STEERING the ship. SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS. BEHIND the
driver. The figure GRABS the driver. AROUND THE NECK. Before the
driver can SCREAM...the figure SLICES HIS THROAT.
Scraggy WITNESSES this. Through an OPEN PORTHOLE. His face covered
with SHOCK. FEAR.
KEZURE, the Pirate King, stands at the edge of the boat. He still
HOLDS the screaming Clare over his shoulder. From the Pirate ship, the
Pirates toss a GRAPNEL ROPE to Kezure. The Pirate King GRABS BOLD of
the rope. Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat,
to the Pirate Ship.
INDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an
effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river
boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in
hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER.
Indiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water
surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS
and FLYING ARROWS.
The swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many Pirates AT BAY.
Scraggy EXCHANGES swordplay with a Pirate. The sword is KNOCKED from
Scraggy's hand. He is DEFENSELESS. The Pirate COMES in for the kill.
He RAISES HIS SWORD...ready to PLUNGE it into Scraggy's heart... The
Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a
SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword
SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the
deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy
gives her a THANKFUL NOD.
Indiana has MADE IT ACROSS the Zambesi. He CLIMBS UP the side of the
Pirate Ship. The Pirates begin to SHOOT at Indy. Indy is HIT. An
ARROW. In the ARM. He dives to safety in a nearby CANNON COMPARTMENT.
Clare has been TIED to a mast pole. Kezure STANDS in front of her. As
his men BATTLE around him, Kezure leans forward. The drooling Pirate
King sloppily KISSES Clare. Along her NECK. Clare is NAUSEOUS.
Kezure kisses the bare shoulder of the STRUGGLING, HELPLESS Clare.
Indy EMERGES from the cannon compartment. Upon seeing the Pirate King
ATTACK Clare, Indiana SHOUTS.
INDIANA
You son of a bitch.
Kezure TURNS. He emits a gravelly laugh and scratches his neck,
curiously STUDYING Indiana. Indy EXTENDS his sword. The Pirate King
removes a long, sharp GOLDEN SWORD. They begin to FIGHT. Moving ALONG
the deck. A FAST PACED, HEATED swordfight.
A PIRATE has taken over the boat's WHEEL. He STEERS the river boat OFF
THE REGULAR PATH. It SPEEDS toward the base of a LARGE, THRASHING
WATERFALL. The Pirate ship moves ALONGSIDE of the river boat, also
HEADED for the waterfall. SCRAGGY and BETSY sees the waterfall ahead.
PANIC fills their eyes. They DASH to the steering wheel. Betsy
DISTRACTS the Pirate. They begin to SWORDFIGHT. Scraggy TAKES the
steering wheel. He attaempts to steer the ship AWAY from the
waterfall.
Indiana and the Pirate King have climbed to the top of the SHIP'S
MAST. They battle AMIDST the tangled ropes. SWORDS CLASHING. As the
two men fight, Indy notices that the Pirate ship is HEADED FOR THE
WATERFALL. Indiana has a sudden REALIZATION. He sees Scraggy, trying
to STEER THE RIVER BOAT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Indy SCREAMS above
the cannon fire.
INDIANA
(still fighting)
Scraggy!... No!... Keep goin'
straight!... Full steam ahead!...
SCRAGGY
is CONFUSED by Indy's orders. He SCREAMS back to Indiana.
SCRAGGY
What?... You crazy Indy?... We be
crushed!... We smash into rock
wall!...
INDIANA
still SWORDFIGHTING the Pirate King, SCREAMS to Scraggy.
INDIANA
No!... Trust me!... Full steam
ahead!... Full steam ahead !...
SCRAGGY
BLESSES himself. His face is STRONG. CONFIDENT. He REVS the engine.
FULL SPEED. He TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the wheel. AIMING the river boat
toward the waterfall.
INDIANA AND KEZURE
SWING from sail to sail, continuing their SPECTACULAR swordfight.
CLARE helplessly watches from the deck.
THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP
continue to move SIDE BY SIDE. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the
shattering waterfall.
SCRAGGY
continues to rev the RIVER BOAT'S engine. CHANTING various prayers
under his breath. In the background, a FEISTY Betsy continues to
swordfight.
THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP
PENETRATE the waterfall. The two boats are met with an exploding
shower of POWERFUL WATER! Crew members and Pirates are TOSSED ABOUT
the deck. Indiana and the Pirate King hold TIGHTLY to the sails, to
AVOID being thrown into the waters below.
The aged boat TOSSES. TILTS. SPINS. Nearly CAPSIZING. Boards CREAK and
MOAN. Ready to BURST. But Scraggy holds TIGHTLY to the steering wheel.
Keeping the boat AFLOAT.
The powerful water sends Betsy SOMERSAULTING along the deck. She tries
to GRAB HOLD of something...anything...that will PREVENT her from
falling off the boat. Betsy finally CLUTCHES onto something. The ARM
OF A DEAD PIRATE.
THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP
are IMMERSED into the waterfall. They DISAPPEAR behind the thrashing
curtain of water.
Scraggy's decrepid MODEL-T TAXI putters across the flat, jungle
terrain. The HOT SUN shines in the background. The car is completely
PACKED with people. Ready to BURST. Scraggy DRIVES. Indiana, Clare and
Betsy are CROWDED in the front seat. Kezure and four Pirates ride in
the REAR COMPARTMENT. Everyone is UNCOMFORTABLE. CRAMPED. SWEATING.
Two of Scraggy's crew members STRADDLE the sideboard. Three men sit on
the ROOF, including the GUITAR PLAYER, who plays a delightful melody.
Various rusted POTS, PANS and other UTENSILS dangle from the car. This
creates a CHARMING, JINGLING sound.
The taxi passes a HERD OF GIRAFFE. The beautiful animals stare in
BEWILDERMENT at the passing taxi. Suddenly, there is a DISTANT SOUND.
The same LOW, RUMBLING we heard earlier. The giraffes SCATTER. AFRAID
of the unnatural sound.
Several GRASS HUTS are scattered throughout this large village.
Indiana and the others are LED into the village. They PASS the
penetrating, unfriendly glares of the villagers. Kezure EXPLAINS to
Indiana.
KEZURE
This is a different tribe. New. They
have taken over the village.
INDIANA
What happened to the other tribe?
Kezure SHRUGS. Indiana TURNS to Scraggy.
INDIANA
You recognize their language?
PAGE 73 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
Suddenly, a VOICE echoes from inside of the oven. The natives LISTEN.
Again, the voice SHOUTS from inside. It's SCRAGGY. The natives
RECOGNIZE the language. They quickly OPEN the oven door. Scraggy is
SCREAMING in the tribe's tongue. The grille is PULLED out of the oven.
The natives hurriedly UNTIE the slightly smoked Indiana, Kezure and
Scraggy.
Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. FURIOUS. He begins to SHOUT at the tribal
CHIEF. The Chief and the villagers are AWESTRUCK by Scraggy's words.
The nervous Chief ORDERS Clare, Betsy and the others UNTIED. Scraggy
WHISPERS to Indiana.
SCRAGGY
I tell him we divine messengers of
Sun Wu-Kung. If he interfere with
our mission... Jade Emperor come
down from heavens and destroy his
village.
Indy SMILES. Scraggy TURNS and again SHOUTS to the chief. The chief
OBEYS Scraggy's every word. He LEADS Indy and Scraggy to another area
of the village. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana.
SCRAGGY
I tell him we lose path to city... I
ask if he have something to help us.
The chief leads Indy and Scraggy into a LARGE GRASS HUT.
The village SLEEPS. QUIET. PEACEFUL. Scraggy's Model-T is PARKED here.
Several of the crew members and Pirates are SLEEPING in and around the
car. KEZURE is sprawled on the car's roof. SNORING. It is obvious that
they have CAMPED here for the evening.
Suddenly, a SLIGHT TREMOR surges through the village. A soft
VIBRATION. Cooking utensils RATTLE. Grass huts SHAKE.
The vibrating INTENSIFIES. The ground begins to RUMBLE. The
surrounding trees SHAKE. The villagers POUR out of their huts,
gathering in the middle of town. FRIGHTENED. Indiana and Betsy JOIN
Scraggy, Clare, Kezure and the others. Betsy is PUZZLED by the
tremors.
BETSY
An earthquake?
The Tribal Chief STEPS FORWARD. He says ONE WORD in his language.
Scraggy TRANSLATES for the others.
SCRAGGY
Wildebeest.
CUT TO:
A HERD OF STAMPEDING WILDEBEEST
Hundreds of the RAGING animals plow through the jungle. Moving FAST.
They CRUSH everything in their path.
The vibrating is LOUDER. HARDER. The villagers PANIC. They RUN AWAY.
SCATTERING into the jungle. Indiana and his party are CLUSTERED
together. Clare EXCLAIMS.
CLARE
We have to get out... Or we'll be
crushed to death.
INDIANA
Scraggy... How close?
Scraggy puts his EAR to the trembling ground. He LISTENS.
SCRAGGY
Two miles.
Indy dashes to the Model-T SUPPLY RACK. He tosses SHOVELS to each of
the group. He LOOKS around.
INDIANA
Where's the softest ground?...
Scraggy asks a PASSING VILLAGER. The villager SHOUTS some gibberish
and continues running. Scraggy POINTS OFF SCREEN. Toward a COMMUNAL
GRAVEYARD.
CUT TO:
THE WILDEBEEST.
SNORTING. STOMPING. CARVING a wide path through the thick jungle.
Small animals RUN for their lives. Bunnies DASH ahead of the herd.
Monkeys SWING to other trees. The ANGRY Wildebeest continue ahead.
Indiana and the others stand in the LARGE GRAVEYARD. SHOVELS in hand.
They have DUG A LARGE HOLE. Pieces of DECAYED BODIES and SKELETONS
protrude from the surrounding hole. Scraggy STARES at the ghastly
sight. Eyes WIDE. FEARFUL. He begins to BABBLE. HYSTERICAL.
SCRAGGY
Oh, no! Many dead spirits! Bad
spirits... We must stay away...
Indy interrupts by PUSHING SCRAGGY INTO THE OPEN GRAVE. Scraggy falls
into the ARMS OF A SKELETON. He SCREAMS.
CUT TO:
THE HERD OF WILDEBEEST
BURSTING through a section of jungle. They arrive on the VAST JUNGLE
PLAIN. Directly ahead of them, several feet in the distance, is the
MONGOOBOO VILLAGE. The Wildebeest head STRAIGHT for the village.
DESERTED. NO SIGN of human life. Everything TREMBLES with the force of
a major earthquake. The wildebeest ARRIVE. DESTROYING the village.
Grass Huts are FLATTENED. The enormous stone oven COLLAPSES. CRUMBLING
to pieces. Scraggy's Model-T is OVERTURNED.
With nothing left standing, the wildebeest MOVE ON. The village has
been completely DEVASTATED. Surrounded with a heavy CLOUD OF DUST.
CAMERA PANS TO THE GRAVEYARD. Grave markers and tombstones lie BROKEN
and CRUSHED. Countless HOOFPRINTS cover the flat ground. The dust
begins to SETTLE. The graveyard ground suddenly BUCKLES. MOVING. A
HAND shoots out. Indiana CLIMBS OUT of the dirt. He is FOLLOWED by the
others, who also CLIMB OUT from underground. Everyone is UNHURT. SAFE.
PROTECTED by the ground above. A skeleton has ATTACHED itself to
Betsy. REFUSING to let go.
Scraggy, Indy and a few of the men RUN to the overturned Model-T Taxi.
They GRAB hold of the car and TURN it back upright.
Clare LOOKS at the devastated village. Betsy stands beside her,
STRUGGLING TO ESCAPE from the clutches of the skeleton. Clare looks
into the DISTANCE. Watching the DEPARTING Wildebeest. She is TROUBLED.
WORRIED.
CLARE
That's odd... Wildebeests will not
stampede unless provoked...
Suddenly, the same LOW, RUMBLING SOUND from earlier, ECHOES through
the area. But this time it is LOUD. Nearly DEAFENING. Scraggy LOOKS at
Indy.
SCRAGGY
This time, it is very close, Indy.
Very close!
At that moment, directly behind Scraggy and Indy, the jungle ERUPTS!
The trees SEPARATE. CRASHING to the ground. Making way for some GIANT
BEHEMOTH. Scraggy and the others LEAP IN ONE DIRECTION. Indiana LEAPS
IN ANOTHER.
A GIANT TANK
SHOOTS out of the jungle. A METAL MONSTROSITY. ONE of a kind. The tank
is over TEN TIMES the size of a normal tank. Nearly 100 FEET LONG.
Over 25 FEET HIGH. It is equipped with THREE LEVELS. On the TOP LEVEL,
is the tank's swivelling GUN BARREL. ENORMOUS. The size of a CANNON.
Two giant, BLAZING RED SWASTIKAS adorn both sides of the tank's SECOND
LEVEL.
The tank RUNS OVER Scraggy's Model-T. The car is FLATTENED. A THICK
CLOUD OF DUST erupts from the ground.
The tank FIRES. The blast is LOW. The ground in front of Indy and the
rhino EXPLODES. A cloud of dust ERUPTS.
The tank is UPON Indy and the rhino. The rhino SCREECHES to a stop.
FRIGHTENED by the blast. Indiana LEAPS ONTO THE TANK. GRIPPING the
front section. HOLDING ON for dear life. Moments before he is crushed
beneath the tank's giant treads, the RHINO TURNS and RUNS OFF.
Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot
of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE.
Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged
rocks. Scraggy begins to CLIMB the tree.
SCRAGGY
Safest place from bad spirits...is
in branches of tree.
The others SHRUG. They have NO CHOICE but to FOLLOW Scraggy up into
the branches of the tree.
Indiana CLIMBS along the side of the monstrous tank. He searches for a
PASSAGEWAY inside of the tank.
Indy CANNOT FIND a passageway into the tank. He SEES the GUN BARREL.
OVERHEAD. It SWIVELS. AIMING toward the tree filled with Indy's
friends. Indy GRABS one of the tank's LARGE HEADLIGHTS. He PULLS HARD.
SNAPPING OFF the headlight. Indy LEAPS upward. He quickly STUFFS the
headlight inside of the barrel opening.
COUNTLESS ROWS OF MACHINE GUNS eject from secret slots. All AROUND the
tank's FIRST LEVEL. The machine guns begin to FIRE. RAPIDLY. WILDLY.
Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the guns. He CLIMBS to the SECOND LEVEL. But
the large SWASTIKAS begin to move. OPENING. They are actually HIDDEN
DOORS. SECRET COMPARTMENTS. Several NAZI SOLDIERS exit the
compartments. They COME FOR Indiana. He FIGHTS the onslaught of
soldiers. PUNCHING. WRESTLING.
The tank, without a driver, begins to wildly SPIN. Going in CIRCLES.
From the tree, SCRAGGY sees Indy's dillemma. He SHOUTS to the others.
SCRAGGY
Indy in trouble! We must help!
Scraggy begins to CLIMB OUT of the tree. A GUN suddenly MOVES INTO
FRAME. POINTED at Scraggy's head. Scraggy TURNS. One of his CREW
MEMBERS holds the gun.
CREW MEMBER
(German accent)
Don't move.
(to the others)
All of you. Stay where you are.
Scraggy and the others FREEZE. Clare makes a REALIZATION. She GLARES
at the Crew Member.
CLARE
It was you. You're the reason the
Nazis found us.
The crew member gives an evil SMILE.
Indiana continues to FIGHT the Nazis, along the SECOND LEVEL of the
frenzied tank. Indy has DEFEATED most of the soldiers. Only TWO NAZIS
remain. They OVERCOME Indy. They push him DOWNWARD. Toward the tank's
FIRST LEVEL. Toward the rows of FIRING MACHINE GUNS. Indiana STRUGGLES
to break free. But the powerful Nazis push him CLOSER...CLOSER...to
the machine guns.
In the TREE, the crew member keeps his pistol AIMED at Scraggy's head.
CAMERA PANS UPWARD. Kezure is PERCHED on the top branch. ABOVE
Scraggy. At the right moment, Kezure LEAPS DOWN. ON TOP of the
treacherous crew member. Kezure KNOCKS the gun from the crew member's
hand. BLAM! The gun GOES OFF. A stray bullet STRIKES the tree trunk.
Kezure PUNCHES the crew member, who LOSES HIS BALANCE and FALLS from
the tree. Going OVER THE EDGE of the ravine. His body DROPS hundreds
of feet. CRASHING to the rocks below.
Kezure SMILES. VICTORIOUS. But the tree suddenly CREAKS. GROANS. A
CRACK has formed around the trunk, where the bullet STRUCK. The tree
begins to TILT. Slowly TEETERING over the ravine's edge. Everyone
PANICS. Betsy SHOUTS.
BETSY
Nobody move. Or we'll go over.
Everyone FREEZES. Scared to DEATH. They TIGHTLY GRIP their branches.
The tree SWAYS. SLOWLY.
Indiana still FIGHTS the two Nazis. STRUGGLING to keep his body from
the tank's deadly machine guns. Indy FLIPS one of the Nazis over his
head. The Nazi falls DIRECTLY IN FRONT of an entire row of machine
guns. His body does a GROTESQUE DANCE OF DEATH. RIDDLED with bullets.
Indiana and the other Nazi exchange PUNCHES. Their bodies TUMBLE over
the rear of the tank. They fall onto a SMALL LEDGE. Above the
enormous, rotating TANK TREADS. Indy and the Nazi battle to push the
other OFF THE LEDGE. Indiana PREVAILS. He pushes the Nazi ON TOP of
the giant treads. The Nazi tries to CLIMB BACK...but his body is
DRAGGED BENEATH THE TANK. CRUSHED.
Indiana turns, seeing Gutterbuhg climb out of a SECRET HATCH. On the
tank's TOP LEVEL. Gutterbuhg POINTS HIS FINGER at Indy. It rapidly
FIRES BULLETS. Indy DODGES around the side of the tank. Bullets BOUNCE
off the metal beside him.
Meanwhile, Indy's friends sit BREATHLESSLY on the swaying tree.
Everyone is SILENT. STILL. Kezure suddenly SNEEZES. The tree CREAKS.
It WAVERS over the ravine's edge. Nearly GOING OVER. But it DOESN'T.
Everyone CATCHES THEIR BREATH. The tree continues to TEETER.
Gutterbuhg PURSUES Indiana. Playing CAT AND MOUSE along the top level
of the tank. Indiana PEERS around a corner. Seeing Gutterbuhg AHEAD.
Indy grabs hold of the large ROTATING GUN BARREL. Indy LIFTS his feet.
He SWINGS FORWAFD. RIDING the gun barrel. He SPINS around the tank's
side and comes up BEHIND the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. Indy JUMPS the
Nazi. They begin to FIGHT. Gutterbuhg tries to move his Mechanical arm
INTO POSITION. To SHOOT Indy.
The tank continues to LOSE CONTROL. It no longer SPINS in CIRCLES. It
is headed STRAIGHT TOWARD the tree filled with Indy's friends.
Gutterbuhg and Indiana continue to FIGHT. Suddenly, there is a BUZZING
SOUND. An AIRPLANE ENGINE. Indiana LOOKS TO THE SKY. A NAZI BIPLANE
FLIES TOWARD HIM. The biplane DIVES. Moving LOWER. LOWER. Gutterbuhg
ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Indy is TRAPPED. A SITTING DUCK. The biplane
SWOOPS DOWN. Trying to HIT Indy. He DIVES onto the tank top. Lying
FLAT. The plane flies DIRECTLY OVER Indy. JUST MISSING him by a FEW
FEET.
Meanwhile, the tank still DRIVES DIRECTLY TOWARD the swaying tree and
ravine. Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others remain FROZEN.
STILL. WATCHING the tank come for them. They are FRIGHTENED. HELPLESS.
Indy and Gutterbuhg have RESUMED their fighting. STANDING on the
tank's top. The biplane LOOPS in the air. Coming back for ANOTHER
SHOT. Gutterbuhg LEAPS out of its path. The plane HEADS STRAIGHT for
Indy. He again DIVES to the tank's top. The biplane SWOOPS DOWN. This
time AIMING LOWER. As it PASSES Indy, its wheels GRAZE his back. Indy
CRIES OUT.
The tank continues to SPEED TOWD the tree of trapped people. Getting
CLOSER...CLOSER...
His back ACHING, Indy struggles to keep Gutterbuhg's machine gun arm
from shooting him. The biplane does another midair LOOP. It TURNS and
HEADS straight for Indy. This time, the plane WON'T MISS. As the
biplane gets CLOSE... Indy grabs a tight HOLD of Gutterbuhg's
Mechanical arm. Indy RAISES the arm. AIMING at the biplane. Indy pulls
the arm's TRIGGER. FIRING a round of shots. The rapid bullets STRIKE
the plane's belly. The biplane LOSES CONTROL. Its engine COUGHS. DIES.
The biplane SPINS. Flipping into a NOSEDIVE. Leaving a trail of BLACK
SMOKE. The biplane HITS the ground. A FLAMING CRASH! SEVERAL FEET from
the tank.
Indiana OVERPOWERS Gutterbuhg. With TWO HARD PUNCHES, Indy FLOORS the
Nazi. Gutterbuhg lies SPRAWLED on the tank's top. UNCONSCIOUS. Indy
TURNS. He sees that the speeding tank is going to CRASH into the
treefull of his friends. Indiana LEAPS into the open tank compartment.
The tank SCREECHES. SPINNING TO A STOP. INCHES from the swaying tree.
Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others, emit a UNIFIED SIGH OF
RELIEF. But the tree suddenly CRACKS. It TILTS. FALLING OVER THE
RAVINE EDGE! Everyone SCREAMS!
There is the sudden CRACK OF A WHIP! The whip WRAPS ITSELF around the
trunk of the tree. Indiana HOLDS the opposite end. He PULLS with all
of his strength. HOLDING the tree in place. He PREVENTS the tree from
FALLING into the ravine. Indy SHOUTS to his friends. Through GRITTED
TEETH.
INDIANA
Jump!... Jump!...
Everyone begins to LEAP from the tree. To the GROUND. Indy CONTINUES
to hold the tree in place. Muscles BULGING. Sweat POURING. Veins
POPPING. Soon, everyone is back on the GROUND. SAFE. Indy RETRIEVES
his whip. The tree TILTS. FALLING over the ravine edge. The tree
CRASHES to the rocks below. SPLINTERING into a million pieces.
On the top level of the tank, Gutterbuhg STIRS. WAKES. But Indiana is
UPON HIM. Using a rope, Indy TIES UP Gutterbuhg. He removes the AMMO
CARTRIDGE from the Nazi's mechanical arm. EMPTYING the bullets onto
the ground. Indiana PUSHES Gutterbuhg INSIDE THE TANK.
Tyki CRAWLS out of the tank. He SEES Clare. TEARS of happiness fill
his eyes. He RUNS to Clare. The two exchange a WARM EMBRACE. Tyki SEES
Scraggy. They shake hands and begin an EXCITED CONVERSATION. Like two
OLD FRIENDS.
Indiana HURRIES to Tyki and the others. Indy shoots an IMPATIENT
glance to Scraggy.
INDIANA
We've got to move. Fast.
(points to Tyki)
Ask him if he knows the way to the
City from here.
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy ANSWERS, pointing OFF SCREEN. Scraggy
TRANSLATES for Indiana.
SCRAGGY
He do not know exact place... But it
is somewhere over there.
Indy TURNs to the direction where Scraggy points. Several miles away,
we see COUNTLESS ROWS OF MOUNTAINS. Thick layers of CLOUDS surround
the mountains. Indiana SIGHS.
INDIANA
A lotta' good that does us... It
could take us months...years...to
search everyone of those.
Betsy has an IDEA. She removes the STONE MIRROR from Indiana's pocket.
BETSY
Maybe he knows what to do with
this...
Betsy GIVES the mirror to Tyki. His eyes WIDEN. In AWE. Tyki
RECOGNIZES the mirror. He excitedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who
TRANSLATES for Indiana.
SCRAGGY
It is "Magical Mirror of Sun Wu
Kung"...
INDIANA
But whattayou do with it?
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an
upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant
mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror.
Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.
The mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one
SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS!
Indiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN.
But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR! Clare SMILES at
Indy, quoting Tyki from earlier.
CLARE
"I come from Land Of City On
Clouds".
Indiana NODS. HOPEFUL. ANXIOUS. He looks back to the magical
REFLECTION.
CUT TO:
THE TANK
travelling a NARROW PATH. Along the side of a STEEP MOUNTAIN. The tank
moves UPWARD. Toward the mountain TOP. The tank JERKS. WOBBLES. It's
as if the driver were having TROUBLE with the controls.
The tank, without a driver, begins to SWERVE OFF THE MOUNTAIN ROAD.
The tank has nearly made it to the TOP of the mountain. Trekking
through a NARROW, ROCKY RAVINE. The tank rolls to a STOP. The top
hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indiana, Scraggy and Tyki POP OUT. Tyki suddenly
points to the MOUNTAIN TOP, which is cloaked in thick LAYERS OF
CLOUDS. Tyki's eyes fill with JOYOUS TEARS. He begins to SHOUT. His
voice SQUEALS with EXCITEMENT. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indy.
SCRAGGY
He say that two miles ahead...we
will find his home.
Indiana SMILES. EXCITED by the prospects. TOUCHED by Tyki's reaction.
Indy looks to the FOOT of the mountain. Several miles BELOW.
THE NAZI FORCES
have ARRIVED! They are still at least TWO HOURS from reaching Indiana
and the others. The massive army MOVES FAST. They begin to DRIVE along
the mountain path. FOLLOWING Indiana. In HOT PURSUIT.
Indy PAUSES. WORRIED. THINKING. He LOOKS at the surrounding ROCKY
WALLS, then to the tank's enormous GUN BARREL. An IDEA. He HURRIES
back inside of the tank. Scraggy and Tyki FOLLOW. CLOSING the hatch
above them.
CLOSE-UP: The tank's large gun barrel SWIVELS. Pointing UPWARD. To the
ROCKS above. The gun FIRES A SHOT. It swivels a FEW FEET. Then FIRES
ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. A RUMBLING SOUND echoes through the area.
The tank SHOOTS forward. SPEEDING ahead. An AVALANCHE BEGINS! JUST
MISSING the tank. Several pounds of ROCKS and DEBRIS fall from above.
The rocks create A THICK WALL. BLOCKING the mountain path.
The tank CONTINUES along the twisting, narrow mountain path. Moving
further and further UPWARD. The tank DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK CLOUDS
that surround the mountain.
The tank is a LARGE, GREY BLUR through the clouds. Several DARK,
BULKING FIGURES APPEAR! They CLIMB along the ravine sides and tops.
The mysterious figures SURROUND the tank. All are holding ENORMOUS
BOULDERS over their heads. AIMED at the tank.
The dark figures SHOWER the tank with heavy boulders. The tank's gun
barrel SNAPS IN TWO. Headlights SMASH. Its body becomes DENTED.
CRACKED.
The injured, wobbling tank moves OUT OF THE CLOUDS. Arriving around
the corner from the MOUNTAIN TOP. The countless dark figures continue
to FOLLOW the tank. SCURRYING along the ravine sides and tops. The
figures EMERGE from the clouds. For the first time, they are VISIBLE.
And we see that the figures are TALL... HAIRY... MUSCULAR... GORILLAS!
They CONTINUE to assault the tank with boulders.
The tank COMES TO A SUDDEN STOP. One of the Gorillas emits a BIGS
PITCHED SHRIEK. COMMUNICATING with the others. The others PAUSE. They
STOP the attack. The Gorillas APPROACH the tank. SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY.
The apes REACH OUT. TOUCHING the tank's wrecked body. A few of the
apes begin to CLIMB onto the tank.
The tank's top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indy's HEAD pops out. TWO HAIRY ARMS
REACH INTO FRAME AND GRAB INDIANA! An enormous Gorilla pulls Indy OUT
OF THE HATCH! The ape TOSSES INDY OFF SCREEN!
Indiana FLIES INTO THE AIR! He LANDS IN THE ARMS of another Gorilla.
The ape TAKES Indy's WHIP and THROWS him to another Gorilla, who takes
Indy's HAT. The Gorilla TOSSES Indy to another ape, who tears off
Indy's LEATHER JACKET. The helpless Indy is THROWN to yet another
Gorilla. The angry ape RAISES Indy over his head. The Gorilla prepares
to THROW INDIANA OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE!
Tyki's VOICE ERUPTS FROM OFF SCREEN. The Gorilla PAUSES, suspending
Indiana HIGH IN THE AIR. The Gorilla TURNS to Tyki. The pygmy STANDS
on the tank. He SHOUTS AN ORDER to the Gorilla. The ape NODS.
UNDERSTANDING. He KNOWS Tyki. The Gorilla gently PLACES Indy back on
the ground. Indiana ADJUSTS what remains of his clothing. He turns,
seeing A GROUP OF GORILLAS. HUDDLED together. The Gorillas SEPARATE.
They have DRESSED one of the apes in INDIANA'S HAT, LEATHER JACKET AND
WHIP! The ape begins to SNAP THE WHIP, almost as if he were IMITATING
Indy.
Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the others have CLIMBED OUT of the tank.
Upon seeing the Gorilla DRESSED as Indy, they BURST INTO LAUGHTER. A
very ANGRY Indiana growls at Tyki.
INDIANA
(pointing to Gorilla)
Tell him to take off my stuff!
Through laughter, Scraggy TRANSLATES for Tyki. The pygmy SHOUTS an
order to the Gorilla. The ape REMOVES the hat and leather jacket,
RELUCTANTLY giving them back to a grumbling Indiana.
Tyki continues to SHOOT orders to the other Gorillas. The pygmy
suddenly appears STRONG. AUTHORITATIVE. He obviously has POWER over
the beasts. The Gorillas GATHER together. They MOVE TOWARD the people.
The apes GENTLY take the hands of the various humans. It is a WARM,
ENCHANTING sight, as the friendly Gorillas LEAD the humans forward.
Clare, using her Gorilla MOTIONS and SOUNDS, communicates with the
beasts. The group moves AROUND A TWISTING CORNER OF THE PATH. Toward
the MOUNTAIN TOP.
AROUND THE CORNER
Indiana and the others are met with an AWESOME SIGHT! Indy STOPS. His
mouth DROPS OPEN. Clare is equally ASTOUNDED. Betsy and the others
STARE AHEAD. In total WONDERMENT. Even Gutterbuhg is AMAZED. The SOUND
TRACK MUSIC EXPLODES INTO A THUNDERING CRESCENDO!
THE LOST CITY OF SUN WU-KUNG
LIES AHEAD of the group. A SPECTACULAR SIGHT! A city whose every
building and tower is cast in SOLID GOLD! SPARKLING! GLISTENING! A
HEAVENLY place. The City is protected by a deep MOAT. The fins of
several SHARKS move through the moat waters. A THICK STONE WALL
surrounds the city. A large, golden DRAWBRIDGE is built into the wall.
PASSAGEWAY into the city.
A tremendous TOWER stretches above the city walls. The GUARD, a pygmy
similiar to Tyki, is POSTED in the tower. The guard SPOTS Tyki,
approaching the city walls. The guard's EYES LIGHT. He SMILES. The
guard CRIES OUT! SHOUTING to everyone inside of the City. He continues
to REPEAT a certain phrase.
Scraggy TRANSLATES the guard's words for Indiana.
SCRAGGY
He say... "Our Prince has returned
home".
Indiana SMILES. Soon, the beautiful sound of COUNTLESS RINGING BELLS
is heard, welcoming Tyki home. Eyes WATERING, a proud Tyki and the
Gorillas LEAD everyone to the foot of the City Walls. The enormous
drawbridge begins to LOWER. A STUNNING SHAFT OF GOLDEN LIGHT escapes
from the opening. As the drawbridge continues to lower, the shaft of
light becomes WIDER. BRIGHTER. It ILLUMINATES the faces of Indy and
the others. When the drawbridge is completely LOWERED, everyone is LED
INTO THE CITY. Their bodies SILHOUETTED against the warm glowing
light.
Gutterbuhg DASHES OUT! A CROWD OF VILLAGERS follow him. In HOT
PURSUIT. Gutterbuhg RUNS toward the city gates. He RUNS through.
ESCAPING the City. The crowd PAUSES. STOPPING. They'll go NO FURTHER.
They SCREAM and SHOUT at the departing Gutterbuhg, who disappears INTO
THE MOUNTAINS.
The arm flies THROUGH the air... It lands into the MOAT! The arm is
ATTACKED by a horde of hungry sharks. They TEAR it to pieces.
CUT TO:
The Nazis have arrived at the section of path that is BLOCKED by the
AVALANCHE. Their other VEHICLES and TROOPS have pulled back. A FEW
HUNDRED FEET from the AVALANCHE. SEVERAL STICKS OF DYNAMITE have been
placed beneath the avalanche. The T.N.T. is connected to a LONG FUSE,
that extends along the path. LIEUT. MEPHISTO stands at the fuse's end.
He STRIKES a match. Preparing to LIGHT THE FUSE. The match flare is
INCHES from the fuse... Mephisto is INTERRUPTED by a FAMILIAR VOICE.
It is GUTTERBUHG. Mephisto BLOWS OUT the match.
A SOAKING WET Sgt. Gutterbuhg SLIDES down the edge of the ravine. He
still wears the COLORFUL, ELABORATE ROBES of Bohbala. Mephisto is
PUZZLED by Gutterbuhg's BIZARRE APPEARANCE. Gutterbuhg STOPS in front
of Mephisto. Gutterbuhg ATTEMPTS a "Heil, Hitler"... but suddenly
realizes that his mechanical arm is GONE. Gutterbuhg DRIPS WATER all
over Mephisto, who is DISGUSTED by the appearance of his officer. He
SLAPS Gutterbuhg.
MEPHISTO
(German; English
subtitles)
Idiot!... Why are you dressed like
that!... Where is your uniform?...
Before he can answer, Gutterbuhg is SHOVED AWAY by the disgusted
Mephisto, who ATTEMPTS to LIGHT the fuse. But his matches are USELESS.
Soaked with WATER. Furious, Mephisto SLAPS Gutterbuhg, ordering him to
fetch something. The snivelling Gutterbuhg nods and bows, SCURRYING
away. He RUNS into the rear of A CANVAS TRUCK.
Gutterbuhg REJOINS Mephisto and EXTENDS his new mechanical arm TOWARD
THE FUSE. Gutterbuhg POINTS his finger. He SQUEEZES A LEVER, located
on the palm of the mechanical arm. A BRIGHT, JAGGED LINE OF ELECTRICAL
CURRENT shoots from the arm's finger! The electricity LIGHTS the fuse.
It BURNS. Moving TOWARD the dynamite. Gutterbuhg and Mephisto HIDE
behind a rock. There is a LOUD EXPLOSION. Rocks and debris FLY THROUGH
THE AIR. The path is CLEARED.
Indiana, armed with a shield, sword and pistol, LEADS his troops
forward. The Nazis are APPROACHING. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the front
jeep, which is mounted with a large RECOILIST MACHINE GUN. The entire
Nazi army is BEHIND HIM. Mephisto's jeep begins to CROSS the
drawbridge. Moving TOWARD Indiana and the others. The recoilist
machine gunner OPENS FIRE on Indy and the troops.
Bullets BOUNCE from Indy's shield. Several of the pygmies are HIT.
FALLING to the drawbridge. An angry pygmy THROWS his spear. It HITS
the machine gunner. THROUGH the heart.
The jeep continues to DRIVE FORWARD. HEADED straight for Indiana, who
LEAPS ONTO the jeep's hood. Indy's troops SPLIT INTO GROUPS. Dashing
around the speeding jeep to BATTLE the oncoming Nazis.
Indiana CRAWLS along the jeep hood. TOWARD the Nazis. Mephisto
attempts to SHOOT Indy. The bullets ZIP through the windshield.
WHIZZING by Indy's head. Indiana GRABS Mephisto. He PULLS the Nazi
over the windshield. Indiana and Mephisto TUMBLE along the jeep's
hood. FIGHTING. STRUGGLING for the gun.
The jeep DIRECTLY BEHIND Mephisto is filled with several CRATES OF
DYNAMITE. GUTTERBUHG, back in uniform, rides here with THREE NAZI
SOLDIERS. As the pygmy troops come forward, Gutterbuhg EXTENDS HIS
MECHANICAL ARM. He ZAPS several of the pygmies. KILLING them with
deadly JOLTS OF ELECTRICITY.
As the jeep PASSES through the City gates, Indiana and Mephisto
continue to BATTLE along the hood.
As the Gorillas climb inside of the tank, Betsy SWINGS across the
passageway to Clare. She EXCHANGES a congratulatory handshake with
Clare. Betsy's face suddenly goes WHITE. A SHOCKING SIGHT.
A GROUP OF NAZIS have climbed to the mountain top. The soldiers SPOT
Clare and Betsy. They RUN TOWARD the women. Betsy and Clare DASH OFF.
Into the THICK of the jungle. The Nazis FOLLOW. In HOT PURSUIT.
CUT TO:
TWO LARGE CANVAS TRUCKS
BARRELLING along the mountain path. KEZURE, the Pirate King, LEAPS
from the side of the path, between the two trucks. Kezure climbs onto
the REAR BUMPER of the FIRST TRUCK. The DRIVER of the SECOND TRUCK
spots Kezure. He begins to FIRE SHOTS at the Pirate King. As bullets
whiz by him, Kezure hurriedly removes a thick METAL CHAIN from around
his neck. He securely CONNECTS the two truck BUMPERS with the chain.
Gutterbuhg ARRIVES at the top. He LOOKS around. There is NO SIGN of
Indy. But the fuse RESTS at the roof's edge. UNLIT. Gutterbuhg
RESTARTS the fuse. At that moment, Indiana LEAPS OUT from inside of
the stone smokestack. He JUMPS the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. They
TUMBLE and FALL OFF the rooftop edge.
Indiana and Gutterbuhg HIT the ground. They continue to STRUGGLE...
FIGHT...as the fuse BURNS in front of them. It SPEEDS toward the pile
of dynamite. Less than FIFTY FEET AHEAD. Still wrestling with
Gutterbuhg, Indy ROLLS toward the fuse. Indy reaches out and STOPS THE
FUSE with his hand. But Gutterbuhg MOVES FAST. Again, the Nazi
RELIGHTS the fuse.
Indy suddenly LEAPS to his feet. He RUNS OFF SCREEN. Gutterbuhg
FOLLOWS. The fuse continues to BURN. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the
dynamite.
Indiana runs to a CLUSTER OF TREES. He comes to an abrupt stop,
between TWO TREES. Gutterbuhg is UPON HIM. The Nazi PAUSES. Only a FEW
FEET from Indy. Gutterbuhg POINTS his arm at Indy. A CLEAR SHOT.
Gutterbuhg SMILES. Indiana is TRAPPED.
THE FUSE is now only a FEW FEET from the dynamite. It will BLOW at any
second!
Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY,
revealing a LARGE LAKE behind him. It's TOO LATE for Gutterbubg. The
electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with
electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the
powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows
from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's
charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.
Indiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now
INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his
whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining
fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy
SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS.
MEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL
FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER
SHOT. Indy removes his REVOLVER. He FIRES at Mephisto. The Nazi DASHES
into the COLISEUM. Indiana FOLLOWS.
CUT TO:
TYKI
BATTLING the oncoming Nazis with his sword. Tyki fights HARD. FAST. He
manages to DEFEAT many Nazis. But the sword is suddenly KNOCKED from
Tyki's hand. A TROOP OF NAZIS come toward him. Their eyes MURDEROUS.
Tyki is TRAPPED. HELPLESS.
As the battle RAGES around them, the Gorilla's tank makes a sudden
U-TURN. It heads straight for the SECOND NAZI TANK.
The Gorilla's tank FIRES A DIRECT SHOT at the other Nazi tank. BLAM!
The Nazis' tank is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS.
The tank SPEEDS TOWARD THE ROWS OF CHARGING NAZI TROOPS. The Nazis
STOP. SHOCKED to see their own tank coming at them. But the tank
continues to BARREL AHEAD. Many of the Nazis are CRUSHED beneath the
heavy tank treads. Others DROP their weapons and RUN. FRIGHTENED.
Indiana, Clare, Betsy, Scraggy, Kezure, the Pirates and Crew members,
have GATHERED outside of the city walls for the journey home. They are
saying "Goodbye" to TYKI, BOHBALA And the other PYGMIES.
Clare and Tyki exchange a TEARFUL FAREWELL, communicating in hand
signals. They share a final EMBRACE. Bohbala again THANKS Indiana for
his help. Betsy says "Goodbye" to the many GORILLAS. Betsy
COMMUNICATES in Gorilla hand motions and growls.
Indiana, holding the Golden Hooped Rod, TURNS and moves across the
drawbridge. The others FOLLOW. The entire city of pygmies and Gorillas
CHEER for their departing friends. Indy and the others DISAPPEAR into
the clouds, walking down the MOUNTAIN PATH. The Lost city GLISTENS in
the background. The drawbridge CLOSES...until the next visitor
ARRIVES.
DISSOLVE T0:
Early AFTERNOON. The sun is HOT. SCORCHING. Indy and his party REST.
They NAP in a shady section of the path. CAMERA PANS THE SNOOZING
BODIES of everyone, coming to a STOP at Indiana. The Golden Hooped Rod
RESTS beside Indy. A HAND COMES INTO FRAME and GRABS the staff. OTHER
HANDS MOVE INTO FRAME. They STEAL Indy's WHIP and REVOLVER. They TAKE
all weapons from Scraggy and his crew members.
Indiana is awakened by a SWORD. At his THROAT. Indy REACHES for his
gun and whip...GONE. He LOOKS UP. KEZURE stands over him, holding the
sword in one hand, the GOLDEN ROD in another. Indy TURNS. The other
Pirates hold SWORDS and DAGGERS at the throats of Clare, Betsy,
Scraggy and the crew members. Kezure TWIRLS the golden hooped rod in
front of him. He SMILES at Indiana.
KEZURE
She is a wonderful treasure...
Eh?...
INDIANA
We had a deal.
KEZURE
(moves sword closer to
Indy's throat)
I have no deals with dead men.
INDIANA
Son of a bitch.
Kezure LAUGHS. He has REMOVED a peach from his pocket. He SHINES the
peach on his cloak, and gives a SHRUG to Indiana.
KEZURE
(shrugs, laughs)
I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do
you suddenly expect me to treat you
with kindness and fairness?... It is
not my way of life!
Indy is DISGUSTED. Kezure TAKES A LARGE BITE from the peach. As he
chews and swallows, Kezure NODS to his men, motioning toward Indy and
the others.
KEZURE
Kill them...
(takes another bite of
the peach)
But save their hair. I will make a
coat out of it.
The men MOVE to kill Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the crew members.
Suddenly, Kezure emits a LOUD SCREAM. He GRABS his stomach in pain. He
FALLS to his knees. The HALF EATEN PEACH rolls from his hand. Onto the
GROUND.
Indy and Clare RUSH TOWARD Kezure. Something very STRANGE is happening
to the Pirate King... His hair begins to FALL OUT. His teeth ROT. His
skin SHRIVELS. His body becomes THINNER. SPINDLY. Kezure has begun to
RAPIDLY AGE. He continues to SCREAM. In horrible PAIN.
The Pirates STEP AWAY. FRIGHTENED. The others WATCH IN HORROR.
Kezure's body CONTORTS. His skin WITHERS... FLAKES... It begins to
PEEL from his bones. His screams FADE... His eyeballs ROLL OUT of
their sockets. Only his skeleton REMAINS. It turns BLACK and CRUMBLES
TO DUST. Only his elaborate clothing REMAINS. The many stolen peaches
ROLL OUT of his cloak, onto the ground.
The remaining Pirates DROP THEIR WEAPONS. They RUN OFF down the
mountain. SCARED to death!
Indiana HOLDS the half eaten peach in his hand. Betsy is PUZZLED.
BETSY
I thought the peaches promised
immortality...eternal youth?...
INDIANA
The garden of immortal peaches
promises life only to those who are
pure in heart.
(pause)
Kezure was evil. His heart was
filled with greed.
Indiana DROPS the peach to the ground. He grabs his WHIP, REVOLVER and
GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Scraggy and his crew members RETRIEVE their
weapons. Everyone TURNS, CONTINUING down the mountain path. LEAVING
Kezure's clothes and the several peaches behind.
CUT TO:
Passengers board a large OCEAN LINER, bound for the United States.
INDIANA JONES is here. Bags PACKED. He holds a rectangular wooden
crate, covered with the words "FRAGILE". The Golden Hooped Rod is
obviously STORED inside. Indy is WAITING for someone. He impatiently
CHECKS his wristwach. LOOKING around. He GRUMBLES to himself.
INDIANA
Where's Betsy?... The boat leaves in
five minutes...
Suddenly, a HORN interrupts. Indy turns to the DIRECTION OF THE SOUND.
It is SCRAGGY. He is wearing DRIVING GOGGLES. He rides a battered,
bruised MOTORCYCLE, attached to a ricketty SIDECAR. The word "TAXI" is
painted on the sidecar's exterior. Scraggy PULLS UP beside Indiana.
Scraggy JUMPS OFF the motorcycle. Excitedly, he RUNS toward Indy.
SCRAGGY
Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you
something for your journey!
Scraggy FUMBLES through his pockets. He removes a small bottle of
PURPLE LIQUID. He HOLDS it out to Indy.
SCRAGGY
Take one drink before bed. It keep
out all bad spirits.
Indy DECLINES. He flashes a FLASK OF WHISKEY from inside of his coat
pocket.
INDIANA
Thanks, Scraggy...
But this'll keep out all the bad spirits. Scraggy SHRUGS. They are
suddenly INTERRUPTED.
BETSY (O.S.)
Indy!...
Indiana TURNS. BETSY and CLARE walk toward him. Indy LOOKS at Betsy.
PUZZLED.
INDIANA
Where're your bags?
BETSY
I'm not leaving.
INDIANA
Huh?... But, you... You have to
finish school.
BETSY
I'm staying on as Clare's assistant.
Indy shoots a JEALOUS GLANCE to Clare, then back to Betsy.
INDIANA
But you're MY assistant.
BETSY
Not any more. I'm having my credits
transfered.
INDIANA
Why?...
BETSY
Clare is a brilliant teacher.
INDIANA
(jealous)
So am I.
CLARE
Yes, but I don't offer a course in
seduction.
INDIANA
You stay out of this.
BETSY
Indy... I thought you wanted me out
of your life...
INDIANA
That was before I realized how
gifted...how talented you are... I
mean... I could really use you...
CLARE
Especially aboard ship for three
weeks. It gets terribly lonely.
INDIANA
I warned you...
BETSY
Indy, I've learned a lot from you.
But it's time I started
concentrating on a career in
anthropology...instead of romance.
INDIANA
(sighs, to Betsy)
You've certainly developed a mature
attitude.
BETSY
(hugs him)
Thanks to you.
(pauses, looking into
Indy's eyes)
You know... I always thought of you
as my knight in shining armor...
INDIANA
(flattered)
Really?
BETSY
But now, I'll think of you as the
Father I never had.
INDIANA
(rolls his eyes)
Terrific.
Clare WALKS up to him. She EXTENDS her hand.
CLARE
Doctor Jones...although your libido
is questionable, your bravery and
intelligence are exceptional.
(a smile)
It has been an honor working with
you.
INDIANA
(taken aback)
Why... Thanks.
Indy LEANS toward Clare, as if he is going to KISS HER. He RAISES an
eyebrow. SPEAKING in his smoothest...most suave...
INDIANA
You know, Clare...there's
something...
CLARE
Yes...
INDIANA
(moving closer)
...something I've been wanting to
do...
CLARE
Yes...
INDIANA
(closer)
...since we first met...
LEANING forward, Indy closes his eyes to KISS Clare. But Clare MOVES
AWAY. BONZO THE GORILLA enters the FRAME. BONZO KISSES Indy on the
lips. Indy OPENS his eyes. He tries to MOVE AWAY. But the Gorilla will
not move, WRAPPING HER ARMS around Indy. The Gorilla WRESTLES Indy to
the ground.
By using Gorilla HAND MOTIONS and GRUNTS, Clare manages to persuade
BONZO to MOVE AWAY from Indiana. Indy WIPES his mouth. Clare, Betsy
and Scraggy are LAUGHING. Betsy EXPLAINS to Clare.
BETSY
Sorry. Guess I left her cage open...
she followed us.
The ocean liner's horn SOUNDS! It begins to DRIFT away from the dock.
Indiana TURNS and RUNS up the stairs, leading to the boat. The boat is
a FEW FEET from the dock. Indy LEAPS onto the boat. He MAKES IT. JUST
IN TIME.
Indiana pauses... Suddenly UPSET. He realizes that he's FORGOTTEN the
Golden Hooped Rod! It SITS on the dock. At Scraggy's FEET. As the
Ocean Liner PULLS AWAY, Indy is about to SCREAM to his friends... But
Clare PICKS UP the crate. She SHRUGS to Indy. The ocean liner pulls
FURTHER...FURTHER...from the dock. Indiana is HELPLESS. He CAN'T GO
BACK.
DISSOLVE TO:
The full moon ILLUMINATES the night sky. SHIMMERING across the ocean
waters. Countless BRIGHT STARS sparkle in the night sky. Indy's OCEAN
LINER sails across the water. The image of an EAGLE appears in the
night sky. SILHOUETTED against the moon.
