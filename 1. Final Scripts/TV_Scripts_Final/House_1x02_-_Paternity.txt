                                            TEASER

      FADE IN:

11EXT. HIGH SCHOOL LACROSSE FIELD -- DAY (DAY 1)

      CLOSE ON a standard lacrosse stick pocket as it catches a
      ball.

      DAN

      16, who just caught the ball, runs behind the back side of
      the goal, directing the offense, taunting a HUGE DEFENSEMAN 
      who cruelly poke-checks his outstretched arm.

      DAN'S POV - As he looks at the field, he sees double.  Dan
      shakes his head to clear the webs.  Field comes back into
      correct view.

      DAN'S PARENTS, PAULA and ANDY, happy, loving, All-American,
      mid 40's, cheer their son from the PACKED STANDS.

      The DEFENSEMAN covering Dan lunges.  Dan takes advantage of
      the defenseman being off balance and darts to his left.  The
      offense is now in motion.

                                      DEFENSEMAN
                    Ball back right, ball back right!

      Dan rockets the ball to his MIDDIE #1, JAKE, who's cutting
      from the top of the key.  Jake catches the ball, then quick-
      sticks it back to Dan.  A bullet.

      DAN'S POV - SLOW MOTION: Two balls come right at him.  He
      tries to focus, but there are definitely two balls.  Which
      ball to catch?  He picks the left ball.

      As he catches the phantom ball, it vaporizes in his stick.

      SAME TIME

      The real ball hits Dan in the cage of his helmet and drops
      to the ground. 

      The crowd roars: "Oh!!!" 

      Dan, still on his feet, looks on the ground for the ball...

      Time slows way down.  We hear Dan's labored breathing and
      heartbeat as crowd noise and sounds of his teammates calling
      for Dan to get the ball all morph into one loud roaring sound.

      VFX: ZOOM right into Dan's eye and into his brain, where we
      see a synaptic lightning storm of activity.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                  HOUSE - Ep04 - YELLOW - 8/24/04  2.

1CONTINUED:1

      As lightning flickers across the gray matter of his brain, a
      powerful and nasty-looking lightning bolt fires right through
      the core. 

      WE ZOOM OUT of his brain just in time for:

      As time speeds back up to real time:

                                    JAKE
                    Dan!  On your left!

      But he doesn't react and a huge defenseman lays Dan out with
        a bone-crushing, illegal crosscheck to the head.  Dan's
      knocked back five yards.  On his back -- helmet knocked off
      his head.

      Another "Oh!"  From the crowd.  Dan's parents gasp. 

      The Referee quickly whistles the play dead.  Motions for
      Dan's coach to come out.

      The TRAINER rushes to Dan's side, quickly assesses the
      situation.

                                      TRAINER
                    You okay?  Dan...  Talk to me.*

      DAN'S POV - the trainer standing over him is barely visible
      or audible.

                                    DAN (O.S.)
                    I... can't see you.

                                      TRAINER
                    Get a doctor.*

      As a sickening rushing sound gets louder and louder...

                                                              SMASH TO MAIN TITLES:

                                      END OF TEASER                                                    HOUSE - Ep04 - BLUE - 8/17/04  3.



                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

22INT. CLINIC -- DAY (DAY 2)

      Dan and his parents wait in the waiting area, anxious.  The
      gash over his eye has almost healed, indicating it's been a
      few weeks since the game.  Paula looks at her watch; they've
      been here for a while.

      HOUSE approaches the reception desk and speaks to a nurse.

                                      HOUSE
                    Z-pak.  Exam room 2.  4:01 p.m., Dr.
                    House checks out.  Please write that
                    down.

      House is about to exit when Andy catches him at the door,
      carrying an oversized file that contains X-Rays, CT scans.

                                    ANDY
                    Dr. House?

                                      HOUSE
                    Sorry, done for the day.  Plenty of
                    docs here to take care of you.

                                    ANDY
                    But we had an appointment.

                                      HOUSE
                    Nice try, but this is a walk-in
                    clinic, which means there are no
                      appointments.  You walk in, sign the
                    chart, and a doctor sees you.  Just
                    not me.

                                    ANDY
                    Your letter says we'd see you.

      This stops House.

                                      HOUSE
                    Not a big letter writer...

      Andy reaches into his file and hands House the letter.

                                    ANDY
                    Here.

      House looks at the letter.  CLOSE ON - House's signature.




                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                  HOUSE - Ep04 - YELLOW - 8/24/04  4.

                                      HOUSE (V.O.)
                    When did my signature get so girly?

33INT. HOUSE'S OFFICE -- DAY

      CLOSE ON - the signature.  CAMERON puts the letter down.

                                      CAMERON
                    I can explain.

      House points at the letter G in his signature.

                                      HOUSE
                    See the G?  See how it makes a big
                    loop on top?  Doesn't even look like*
                    my handwriting.  Do you think I have*
                      something?  What's the differential
                    diagnosis for writing G's like a
                    junior high school girl?

                                      CAMERON
                    It's impossible for anyone to get to
                    you through normal channels; they've
                    written, e-mailed, called -- 

                                      HOUSE
                    -- Perseverance doesn't equal
                      worthiness.  Next time you want my
                      attention, wear something fun.  Low
                    rider jeans are hot.

      Frustrated, Cameron gives the facts:

                                      CAMERON
                    Sixteen year old male, sudden onset
                    of double vision and night terrors
                    without any apparent cause.  The
                    kid's been to two neurologists, an
                    E.N.T. --

                                      HOUSE
                    -- Night terrors.  As in big, scary
                    monsters?

                                      CAMERON
                    Yes.

      House starts to exit.

                                      CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    Where are you going?




                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                    HOUSE - Ep04 - PINK - 8/23/04  5.

                                      HOUSE
                    To talk to the family.

                                      CAMERON
                    You're going to examine him?

                                      HOUSE
                    Nine times out of ten, there's no
                    reason to talk to the patient.  But
                    night terrors in a sixteen year old
                    is a very good reason to talk to
                    this family.  Good work.

      Cameron is touched by the compliment -- perhaps more than
      she'd like to admit.

                                      CAMERON
                    Thank you.

44INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM #2 -- DAY

      EXTREME CLOSE UP -- DAN'S EYE

      A pinlight slides across the surface of the eye, side to
      side.

                                      HOUSE (O.S.)
                    Margins are fine, no lesions, color's
                    good.

      PULL OUT TO REVEAL House shining a light in Dan's left eye. 
      A fundus exam.  Cameron's also present, observing closely. 
      Dan's parents watch nervously.

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    How long have you been having the
                    night terrors?

                                    DAN
                    Three weeks.

                                    ANDY
                    He's afraid to go to bed.  He's
                      exhausted, can barely function.

      House flicks his finger at Dan's eye -- a threat test.  Dan
      blinks.  Flicks again.  Dan recoils.

                                      PAULA
                    What does that tell you?

                                      HOUSE
                    Nothing.

                    I just do that because it's fun to
                    watch him blink.
                          (to Dan)
                    Name as many animals as you can that
                    begin with the letter B.  Go.

      Dan's stumped.  Five very long seconds pass.  The parents
      are worried.  Finally, Dan's got one:

                                    DAN
                    ...baby elephant?

                                      HOUSE
                    Baby elephant... is actually a good
                    answer.  B's a bear of a letter.

                                    ANDY
                    What does that tell you?

                                      HOUSE
                    Proves two things - no neurological
                    damage; and your son's never gonna
                    make chief fry cook.

      The parents are beginning to wonder what's up with this
      doctor.

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    In teens, there are two likely causes
                    of night terrors: post traumatic
                    stress... any recent shootouts at
                    your high school? 

                                    DAN
                    No.

                                      HOUSE
                    Well, Dave --

                    Dan.

                                      HOUSE
                    -- if there's no trauma, the other
                    cause is sexual abuse.

      House quickly searches their faces.

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    So.  Who's molesting you?

      Dan and his parents look shocked.  This line of questioning*
      wasn't what Cameron was expecting either.

                          (to Dan)
                    This lack of response is consistent
                    with abuse.

                                    DAN
                    No one.  I swear.  There was trauma;
                    I got hit in the head during a
                    lacrosse game.

                                      HOUSE
                    Lacrosse game?
                          (to Cameron)
                    Did you know he got hit in the head?

                    They didn't mention it, no.

      And he heads for the exit. 

55INT. CLINIC -- DAY

      House exits Exam Room #2.  But Andy stubbornly, and
        desperately, follows House.  Paula, Dan and Cameron are close
      behind.

                                    ANDY
                    No.  We went to the ER after the
                    game.  They scanned him and tested
                    him; they said he was fine; no
                      concussion.  It's gotta be something
                    else.

                                      HOUSE

                    Cool.  The E.R. obviously screwed
                    up; kid's got a concussion.

                                    DAN
                    I had double vision before I was
                    hit.

                          (stops)
                    Well that changes everything.  You
                    need glasses.  That's why you had
                    double vision, which is why you got
                    hit, which is why you have a
                      concussion which is why you have
                    night terrors.  You need to see an
                      ophthalmologist; which I am not.

      House hurries away.  Cameron chases after House as he exits. 

66INT. HOSPITAL - MAIN LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

      Cameron stops him just outside the doors to the clinic. 
      They're pretty much alone.

                                      CAMERON
                    You enjoyed that.

      House and Cameron are positioned so that we see Dan in the
      background, leaning against the desk in the clinic, next to
      his mom, while his dad talks to a nurse at reception.

                                      CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    I brought a reasonable case to your
                    attention which you shoved in my
                    face to humiliate me.

      House realizes something.

                    You're an only child aren't you.

      This question hits Cameron far more than it should have.

                                      CAMERON
                    Why did you say that?

                                      HOUSE
                    Because everything is about you. 
                    This may seem incredibly
                      controversial, but I think sexual
                    abuse is bad.  I wanted to make sure
                    he wasn't getting diddled by daddy.

                      Interesting.

      ANGLE ON - DAN - SLOW MOTION

      Suddenly Dan's leg quickly tenses, shoots out.  It's a very
      subtle move.  No one would notice it even if they were looking
      for it.  Except House.

      PUSH IN on House, watching Dan through the window.  He blows
      past Cameron and quickly re-enters the clinic.

      House approaches Dan.

                    It's called a myoclonic jerk.  Very
                    common when you're falling asleep. 
                      Respiration rate slows down and
                    sometimes the brain interprets this
                    as the body dying -- so it sends a
                    pulse to wake it up.

                                    ANDY

                    Admit him.

      House walks away.  Off the family, shocked and scared, none
      of this is what they were expecting.  Andy puts his arm
        reassuringly around his son's shoulders.

                    terrors, I want to see it.

99INT. DAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

      Dan is strapped down in his hospital bed wearing a SIX-POINT
      RESTRAINT SYSTEM.  There are twelve wires with metal leads
      attached to his head -- the EEG.  There are also leads
      attached above and below his eyes and chin; strap around his
      chest; a respirator in his nose; a neck microphone; a digital
      camera recording his every move all hooked up to an EDENTRACE
        polysomnograph.

      House enters.  Tightens the straps on Dan's chest, thighs,
      ankles and wrists.

                                    DAN
                    I usually don't move during night
                    terrors.

                                      HOUSE
                    I'm not restraining you for them.

      House wheels a surgical tray to Dan's feet.

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    EEG revealed abnormalities in your
                    brain which caused some nerve damage
                    in your toes.

      House pricks Dan's big toe with his pen.

                                    DAN
                    Ow.

      House gives him a look: see?

      betadyne.  Uses a surgical marker and draws a circle around
      the big toe.

                    What are you doing?

      House picks up a pair of bone cutters.

                                      HOUSE
                    Fixing it.

                                    DAN
                    Can I talk to my parents?

                                      HOUSE
                    They know all about this...

      House encircles the big toe with the cutters.  Gets a good
      grip.  A tracing of blood appears around the big toe.  House
      has a really menacing look in his face.

                                    DAN
                    Please -- I'd really like them here.

                    This might sting a little, Dan.*

      With all House's might, House snaps the bone cutters closed. 
      Crunch.  Dan screams. 

                                                                                SMASH TO:

      Everything we just saw was a night terror.  Dan is in his
      hospital bed, awake, his eyes open, peaceful, breathing
      normally -- but not blinking.  He's in the exact same bed,
      in the exact same room, with the exact same equipment - except
      for the restraint system.  The EEG is now making horrible
      scratching noises as it moves.

                      Hallervorden-Spatz is a beautiful
                    name.  Lyrical.  Evocative of
                      springtime in the cerebellum.

                                      CAMERON
                    Dr. Hallervorden gassed almost a
                    hundred thousand mentally ill patients
                    during World War Two.

                    Might have.  What difference does it
                    make?  It's a name, not a prize. 
                    And it's not the name of a puppy;
                    it's the name of a disease - that
                    kills people.  Naming it after a
                    murderer seems like a good idea
                    actually.  Who sees something on the
                    MRI?

                    a small clue that there's a
                      neurological problem and wasn't afraid
                    to run with it.

                                      FOREMAN
                    There's no evidence of meningitis on

                    He knew I saw something on the MRI,
                    so he figured there must be something
                    there and he took a guess.

                    There's some bowing.

      Foreman injects 2 cc's of xylocaine from a very short needle

                    That was the anesthetic, right?

      Foreman picks up a big nasty-looking needle -- very long.

                    Yup.  Now I've got to use my driver
                    to get into the spine.  You set?

      Dan sets himself.  Foreman presses the needle into the skin. 
      Foreman finds what he's looking for in his spine.  Tight
      space; big needle.  He exerts quite a bit of muscle to advance
      the needle.  It hurts.

      Foreman removes the stylet and begins to inject a
      radioisotope.

      Foreman looks at Dan's face.  Then Andy's.

                    the symptoms, but as the disease
                      progresses the problems will become
                    more severe: bowel and bladder
                      dysfunction, cognitive function,
                    pain -- not much to do about those.

                    The brain's like a big jumble of
                    wires; M.S. strips them of their
                      insulation and the nerves die --
                    brain interprets it as pain.

      Andy holds Paula who can't hold her emotion in check anymore.

                    But by starting treatment we're going
                    to prevent that for as long as
                    possible.  We're looking into a couple
                    of specialists and until we get you
                    squared away you'll stay here, okay?

      Dan is obviously and understandably frightened.

      Chase fades and disappears...

      The parents fade and disappear...

      Day dissolves to night...

      Time has passed.  Dan is alone, in bed, unable to sleep,
      just staring up at the camera...

1818INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR/PATIENT ROOMS -- NIGHT

      Contrary to the way we saw the hospital during the day, at
      night, it's very different.  It's almost empty.  Only
      essential personnel are there.

      At the Nurses' Station, instead of the normal buzz of
      activity, there's only one night nurse who's responsible for
      the entire floor.  The phone doesn't ring.  Bells don't go
      off.  Elevator doors don't open.  It's quiet. 

      An ORDERLY exits a patient room with a cart laden with
      finished dinner trays, she heads for Dan's room.

1919INT. DAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

      She enters and stops.

      REVEAL the bed we just saw, where Dan couldn't sleep, is now
      empty...

      The Orderly runs to the bed and presses a red button on the
      bed.  An alarm sounds through the quiet...

2020INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - NURSES' STATION -- NIGHT

      Foreman runs up to Cameron, who hangs up the phone.

                                      CAMERON
                    Security reviewed videotape from all
                    perimeter cameras.  He's gotta still*
                    be inside the hospital.*

                    Where's Chase?

2121INT. 4TH FLOOR/ADMINISTRATION -- NIGHT

      Cameron pokes her head in and out of rooms as she hurries
      down the empty hallway. 

      She hears something.  Pauses.  Nothing.  She looks over her
      shoulder.  Looks left, right.  Nothing.  She continues on...

2222INT. CLINIC -- NIGHT

      Chase has a Security Guard unlock the closed clinic. 

      Chase checks the pharmacy and the exam rooms.  It's eerie
      when no one's around. 

2323INT. HOSPITAL - MORGUE -- NIGHT

      Cameron enters to see a female body under a white sheet on
      the surgical table.  This place freaks her out. 

      No Dan anywhere...

2424INT. HOUSE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      House is watching TV: Fox's Best Damned Sports Show.  The
      phone rings.  Rings.  House's eyes pivot to the phone.

2525INT. HOSPITAL - FRONT ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

      House is on his way in, just as CUDDY, wearing a tennis outfit
      and carrying a tennis racquet, exits.

                                      HOUSE

                    What are you doing back here? 
                    Patient?

                    No, hooker went to my office instead
                    of my home.

      House hobbles away.  Cuddy watches him go.

2626INT. HOUSE'S OUTER OFFICE -- NIGHT

      Foreman enters House's office.  Sees House, waiting.

                                      FOREMAN
                    Dan's missing.

                    You said I was needed immediately.

                                      FOREMAN
                    He shouldn't move after a lumbar
                    puncture.

                                      HOUSE
                    I agree, he's going to have a nasty
                    headache.  That would also be my
                    opinion if consulted tomorrow morning.

                                      FOREMAN
                    We wanted to keep you informed.  He
                    heard some pretty heavy news.

                                      HOUSE
                    This isn't a toddler wandering around*
                    a scary hospital.  He's sixteen. 
                    You'll find him.  I'm going home.

                                      FOREMAN
                    So when you say call me if we need
                    anything, that means don't call me.

                                      HOUSE
                    No.  It means call me if I can do*
                    anything.  I'm bad at search parties*
                    and I'm bad at sitting around, doing*
                    nothing, looking nervous.*

      He heads for the door.

                                      FOREMAN
                    What about his parents?  Should we
                    call them?

                                      HOUSE
                    Why?  Do you think they're hiding him?

      As he walks away... Foreman: what an asshole.

2727INT. STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

      Foreman and Cameron take two at a time up the staircase. 
      CLOSE ON their feet going up.  Rhythmic.  Both are obviously
      in great shape.  Up, up, up, they don't stop until they reach
      a landing where a DOOR is kept propped open a few inches by
      a piece of wood.

      They explode through the door which leads onto the roof. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:

2828EXT. HIGH SCHOOL LACROSSE FIELD -- NIGHT

      In his hospital gown, Dan stands behind the goal, eyeing the
      empty field.  He takes another step onto the back line.

      But all is not as it seems... in fact, it's a whole lot worse:

2929EXT. HOSPITAL - ROOF - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

      Everything we just saw was a hallucination.  Dan and Chase
      are in the exact same positions we just saw - relative to
      each other - but they're actually on the roof.  They're just
      a few feet apart but Dan is one step from stepping off the
      ledge and falling twenty floors to his death. 

                                      CHASE
                    Who knows what they'll discover in
                    the next year or two?

                          (to Chase)
                    This is where I dropped the ball.

                    He doesn't know where he is.

      Foreman takes a step closer to Dan -- but Chase subtly waves
      him off.  Chase advances... tries to get through to him.

                                      CHASE
                    Dan?  I'm right here.  Dan, we're
                    standing on the roof of the hospital.

      Dan begins to pretend to cradle the ball (lacrosse style),
      pivoting, like he's going to throw, he's in the game, moving
      around...

                                      CHASE (CONT'D)
                    Dan.  You're not on the field.

      Dan steps forward - straight toward the edge of the roof;
      just inches from the edge.  Pump fakes.  Another step forward
      and --

                                      CAMERON
                    Dan --!*

      Chase is in a dead sprint from the side to save him.  Dives. 
      Just as Dan starts off the ledge he's blindsided by Chase --
      knocking him back, tackling him.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

3030INT. HOSPITAL - MAIN LOBBY / ELEVATOR -- DAY (DAY 5)

      A new day.  House approaches the elevator, pushes the button
      and waits.  Foreman, haggard, comes down the stairs.  House
      notices Foreman before Foreman notices House.

                    They're not suing; I think because
                    Chase asked them --

                    was in an acute confusional state.

                    story, she was going to be a hospital
                      administrator, but just hated having
                    to screw people like that.

                    In due course, of course.

3535INT. DAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY (DAY 6)

      Chase stands behind Dan as he finishes inserting the long
      needle into Dan's back.  Dan's a little groggy from
      medication, but not exhibiting any dementia like before.

      Cameron holds Dan's hands tightly.

                                      CHASE
                    You know the drill, huh Dan?

      Dan looks at her eyes.  Cameron smiles.  Chase starts to
      inject Penicillin into Dan's spine.

                                      CHASE (CONT'D)
                    The treatment should start helping
                    soon.  Let us know if it's easier to
                    focus on things, remember stuff...

      Cameron holds his hands tightly -- she feels for this kid
      and as we come around, we see that his eyes are watering
      from the pain.

      Chase reads Cameron's look -- knows Dan is suffering.  Chase
      whispers in Dan's ear.

                                      CHASE (CONT'D)
                    Isn't Dr. Cameron's necklace
                      beautiful?

      With a free hand, she reaches down and instinctively touches
      her necklace.

      DAN'S POV

      Cameron's necklace; and her cleavage...

      Cameron looks down at her necklace and sees why Chase
      suggested this: so Dan could look down her shirt.

                                      CAMERON

                    The kid's in pain...

      DAN'S POV

      He looks away from her cleavage as a low roaring increases
      in volume.  The room starts to vibrate.

                                      VOICE
                    I control you.

      BACK TO SCENE

      There is nothing vibrating in this room.  No earthquake. 
      Everything is normal.

                                    DAN
                    -- No.

      The roaring sound blasts.

      Dan convulses violently on the table.  If his head could
      spin around it would.  Blood drips on his pillow around his
      eyes.  Drip.  Drip.  Faster.

                                      VOICE
                    I am going to eat your brain.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Contrary to Dan's POV, Dan's body is not convulsing.  There
      is no blood on his pillow.  And there is no roaring sound. 
      Just Chase injecting him in the back and Cameron holding his
      hands.

      Dan's staring off into space -- not connecting to Cameron.

                                    DAN
                    Leave me alone.

                    Dan was vaccinated.  At six months.

                    You know why kids get vaccinated at
                    six months?  Because they're protected

                    mother's immune system.  So, was she*

      House is with Foreman, Chase and Cameron. 

                                      HOUSE
                    A kid picks up a regular old measles
                    virus, he gets a rash.*

      CUT TO VFX: A magnified view of a VIRUS.  We get closer and
      closer until it looks like DARTH VADER'S DEATH-STAR, EXCEPT
      WITH TEETH.

                    He's extremely uncomfortable and has
                    a wicked fever, but he lives.  But
                    here's the kicker.  Once every million
                    or so times, the virus mutates.

      VFX: We go in EVEN CLOSER on the virus - down to the molecular
      level.  The familiar double-helix DNA structure -- this DNA
      is measles.  But the outside of one of the rungs viciously
      snaps.

                    Suppose you could make an argument
                    the kid's still in Stage One.  But
                    once SSPE moves into Stage Two --

                    ...There is one other way.

4545INT. OPERATING ROOM -- DAY

      EXTREME CLOSE-UP -- DAN'S EYE

      The pupil is dilated.  A long, thin needle attached to a
      surgical arm is poised to go into Dan's eye.

                                      FOREMAN (O.S.)
                    The retinal nerve at the back of the
                    eye.  It will contain measles
                      antibodies too.

      PULL OUT TO REVEAL Dan is on a surgical gurney.  His head
      has been bolted into place.  A very thin needle is about to
      go into his eye.

      Dan's parents are beside themselves with anxiety.

                                    DAN
                          (petrified)
                    You sure this isn't going to hurt?

                                      FOREMAN
                    Yes.  It's just scary as hell.

      Cameron thumbs her necklace.  There's nothing for Dan to
      look at this time.  Foreman nods to a retinal surgeon who
      uses a computer to help guide the needle into Dan's eye.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                HOUSE - Ep04 - YELLOW - 8/24/04  55.

                    Ready?

      The retinal surgeon taps out some commands on his keyboard.

                                      FOREMAN (CONT'D)
                    Here we go.

      Foreman nods to the surgeon, the parents turn away, can't
      watch and...

      VFX: NEEDLE POV.  We dive into Dan's eye.  Pierce the thin
      clear bubble of the cornea -- watch the colored iris come
      rushing up at us as we dive through the pupil which is black. 
      We burst through the other side to the lens.  Push through
      the clear, jelly-like vitreous humor to the retina.  Here we
      start to magnify -- there are 120 million rods and 7 million
      cones.  We blast through a forest of black and red cones and
      rods to the base of the retina where we find what we saw
      earlier: Darth Vader's death-star with teeth; the measles
      virus magnified 10,000 times.  The needle sucks it up.

4646INT. DAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

      CLOSE ON - Parental Consent Form.  Pages upon pages.  Foreman

                    We've confirmed that the problem is
                    this mutated virus.

                    Look, I'm sorry, I'll explain it as
                    best I can but the notion that you're
                    going to fully understand your son's
                    treatment and make an informed
                    decision is kind of insane.
                          (then)
                    Here's what you need to know: it's
                      dangerous; it could kill him; you
                    should do it. 
                          (off their looks)
                    What it really boils down to is: do
                    you trust Dr. House?

      Beat.  Do they?  He's abrupt and insane and rude but do they
      trust him?  They look to each other...  Then Andy picks up
      the paperwork...

      CLOSE ON - A DRILL

      Boring into Dan's head.  Surgical nurses sponge the blood.

      REVEAL

      Dan on the operating table.  There is a steel cage around
      his head, securing it.  Surgeons insert a ventricular catheter
      into Dan's brain.  This'll look weird and cool: the surgeon
      pushes the catheter deeper and deeper into Dan's brain.

      Beat.  Well that sucks.  Finally, House takes out his wallet. 
      Takes out a huge wad of cash.  Starts organizing it by
      hundreds and fifties.

                                      HOUSE

4949INT. DAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY (DAY 7)

      Foreman checks Dan's EEG tracings from a recent
        polysomnograph.  No crazy-looking spikes, etc.  He nods
      confidently at Cameron.  Dan wakes up -- smiles at Cameron.

                    What?  How's that?

                                    DAN
                    Cleft chin.  I have one, my dad
                    doesn't.  Looked it up on the
                    Internet.  It's one of those trait
                    things. 

      Foreman feels dirty, abused and stupid.  And a little poorer.

                                      FOREMAN
                    That's right.  It's autosomal
                    dominant.  Since neither of your
                    parents have cleft chins, it's highly
                    unlikely you're biologically related.

      [Note: neither Andy and Paula have cleft chins, but Dan does.]

                    Of course, the fact that he's not
                    your biological father...

      Dan has thought about this for years...

                                    DAN
                    I've got no problem with being
                    adopted.

      The alternative on the other hand, he does have a problem
      with.

                                    DAN (CONT'D)
                    I love my parents. 

      Cameron understands the significance of this and respects
      his choice. 

      Paula and Andy enter.  Give a hopeful look to the doctors.

                                      CAMERON
                    He's a smart kid.  And he's going to
                    be fine.

      Paula and Andy rush to Dan -- hugging their son.

5050EXT. UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC FIELD -- DAY

      Two great lacrosse teams battle it out.  Music up: something
      thoughtful like Bill Evans "Peace Piece."

      SLOW MOTION.  At the midline, two defenseman race up the
      sideline passing the ball back and forth, finally clearing
      it over the line to a MIDDIE who dekes outside, then beats
      his man and charges inside towards the goal with the ball.

      REVEAL HOUSE -- off to the side of the stands... not in the
      crowd, but not a casual bystander.

      ON THE MIDDIE, #26, his legs churning.  Clumps of dirt being
      kicked up by his spikes into the air.  This guy has serious
      speed as he pulls away from his defender.

      HOUSE

                          (watching #26 run)
                    Wheels, two-six, wheels!

      ON THE FIELD.  Midstride, the middie brings back his stick
      to shoot: sidearm.

      HOUSE holds his cane below the top -- like a lacrosse stick. 
      He mimics the middie EVER SO SUBTLY. 

      SLOW MOTION: The middie winds up.  House grips his cane. 
      Middie shoots. 


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                  HOUSE - Ep04 - BLUE - 8/17/04  60.

      HOUSE makes the tiniest of movements.  Did House just shoot?

      FOLLOW THE BALL as it rockets over the right shoulder of the
      goalie into the top left corner of the goal.  The ball makes
      a loud SMACK as it hits the tape.  Goal!  The middie leaps
      into the arms of his teammates to celebrate.

      HOUSE shows no reaction -- looks at the stands going crazy --
      a great goal.  No one for House to celebrate with.  PUSH IN
      on House.  We see this game was once very dear to him.  Thumbs
      the top of his cane.  This is his lacrosse stick now. 

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL - the game ended a long time ago.  Stands
      are empty.  It's just House, standing there, watching an
      empty field. 

      And then there's House.  Alone.  Who hobbles away.  With his
      stick.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
