A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on
Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries
a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight
years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and
hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were
spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language
is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very
good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your
problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's
no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps
it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
flat.
ANGLE
Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white
intern's coat from his paper bag.
CUT TO:
CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement
with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat
over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless
sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,
Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction
worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.
He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline
pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.
Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley
were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to
1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and
spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and
the Clerk exit to the sales counter.
CUT TO:
As they approach, the Clerk goes behind it.
CLERK
What you working on?
CHRIS
Drillin' some post holes into

CHRIS
Cash. Put "Jack's Fencing" on

Neil handles the two Guards.
NEIL

CUT TO:
Planes ROAR overhead in landings or takeoffs. Yellow vapor
lamps glare. It's gaudy with lights. Neil and a man named
NATE are parked next to each other facing opposite
directions. Nate's 50 - an ex-prize fighter with his nose
all over his face in a silver Mercedes. His big muscles
have gone to flab. He wears a yellow rayon shirt. He's
deeply tanned and pock-narked.
Nate functions as a middleman and fence for Neil. All
calls from people who want to contact Neil come to Nate.
Right now he examines the manila envelope from the armored
truck. Neil's in a Lincoln Town car, gray suit, white
shirt, no tie.

HEINZ
You recognize their m.o.?
HANNA
Yeah. Their m.o. is that they
are good. Once it escalated
into a Murder One beef for all
of them after they killed the
first two, they popped guard
number three 'cause it didn't
rake any difference anymore, so
why leave a living witness?
Drop of a hat? They'll rock and
roll. Also: the way they went
into the side indicates they are
equipped to go in on the prowl.
So also start looking for recent
highline burgularies that have
'mystified' us.

Run the "slick" bit to the FBI
and see what it kicks out.
DRUCKER

EADY
Are you married?

Why?
EADY

NEIL
I deal with state officials.

NEIL
I know enough.
EADY
My father wanted me to marry
someone in Taipei. It was like
I was a piece of furniture: "Go
be his wife." After I left he
won't talk to me. Because I
went on my own. I can't let
people tell roe what to do again.
And that trust comes from knowing
someone over time.
(avoids Neil)
This is hard between us for me.
Because I like you very much.
Neil looks right into Eady's face.
NEIL
I have to leave. Come away with
me.

No one will ever tell you what
to do... You'll never lose
yourself with me.
She believes him.
So do we.

It's later. Breedan's been sick. Now he's sober. They

fishing nets and blue lights.
BREEDAN
I got any left?
LILLIAN
There's other paychecks. You

CUT TO:
Nothing. Hold. Then the Pontiac work car cruises
the
alley. It's dark, but we recognize Cerrito driving
with
Neil in the passenger seat. Pontiac does not slow
down at
ERA, keeps going to the end of the block and turns
left.
CUT TO:
Cruises the alley a second time.
Again, it doesn't stop.
CUT TO:
And a ten man
SWAT Team are spread out across roofs. The
men wear flack
vests and carry an array of shotguns and
assault rifles
and shotguns. Everybody Is still. CAPT.
JACKSON uses a
periscope to see over the edge:
JACKSON'S POV: ALLEY
Abandoned.
Nothing. Then the Pontiac with its lights off rolls
forward. Chris gets out with a salesman's sample case and
pads down the five steps to the rear entry of the jewelry
store. Chris is in a black suit and sneakers. There are
surgical gloves on his hands. The others stay in the car.
TIGHTER: CHRIS
assembles a heavy lock punch from the black case.
It's
formidable. He nods.
CERRITO
in lineman's gear
is out of the car and he quickly climbs
the telephone pole
like an experienced lineman. The
telephone pole is
next to the roof upon which Jackson and
the SWAT Team are
staked-out.
TOP OF POLE - CERRITO
arrives. He's 18 inches away from 11 cops.
Team nor
Cerrito are aware of each other.
Maneuvers past P.G.E. gear and opens the GTE junction box.

alarm circuits.
Doesn't know Cerrito is there. He hears BREATHING. He's
curious. He raises his head over the edge and his eyes go
wide. WIDEN. He's inches from the back of Cerrito's head.
Cerrito twists and turns and jerks back in effort - almost
touching Jackson. Cerrito's too absorbed to sense Jackson's
presence. Jackson carefully closes his eyes and sinks
down.
He gets a nod from Cerrito.
He slams the lock punch with
a cut down sledge hammer.
ECU: DOOR
A I" circle is punched into the steel lock mechanism next
to the cylinder, exposing electrical wiring and magnetic
tumblers and "gates."
ECU: CHRIS' FINGERS
like a cardiac surgeon's, have
a balletic grace as they
manipulate the tumblers so the
groove cut in each one lines
up. As they do, a bar of metal
called the "fence" falls
into the channel created by the
lined-up gates, unlocking
the mechanism.
WIDE: CHRIS
touches the door. It swings - soundlessly - open on its
hinges.
Surprisingly, they now pack up. Neil, Chris and
Cerrito climb into the Pontiac and drive away. The door
was left wide open.
JACKSON
(into walkie-talkie)
Where'd...they...go?
JACKSON
(into radio;

They're leaving. Why are they
leaving?!

HANNA

And I am not settling for some
chicken shit misdemeanor!
Cerrito pulls away. At the end he turns on his headlights,
signals like a good driver, and turns right.
A "Las Vegas Police Department" car pulls to the curb.
Hanna and Schwartz get out and cross the crabgrass, dirt,

WIDEN. It's a desolate area - empty space. Off in the
distance is a manufacturing plant and a billboard. PAN
LEFT and HOLD on Cerrito's Coupe de Ville. It pulls down
the dirt access road, lurching up and down on its soft
shocks, and raising billows of tan dust. It stops. Neil -
in a gray chamois jacket over a black T-shirt - gets out.
He hasn't shaved in a couple of days. Chris and Michael
Cerrito get out the left side. They walk TO CAMERA and:
CERRITO

The two men run back from their observation position to an

It's later. The CAMERA PANS the empty, desolate landscape

HANNA (O.S.)
What are they taking down out

PULL BACK to REVEAL Hanna, Schwartz, Casals and Bosko.
Hanna looks through binoculars.
CASALS
They were looking at something
southwest...
HANNA
What's's that down there?
CASALS
An auto parts company. They're
going to knock over a payroll?
SCHWARTZ
The company only pays by check.

Hanna turns his back on the rest of the detectives and a
big smile dawns upon his face. He raises his arms out
wide. Hanna turns in one direction, then another. Schwartz
doesn't understand.
HANNA

We HEAR a CAMERA SHUTTER CLICK. The IMAGE FOCUSES and
DEFOCUSES. Another CLICK.
HANNA
Us. The L.A.P.D. The Police
Department. We just got made...
Hanna laughs.
Pull back to reveal he's being surveilled by Neil. He's
been photographing Hanna with a black Nikon on a tripod
with a 1300Mm Questar Reflector lens. Neil's made his
tail. The recce in the blue Cadillac was bait. Neil half
returns Hanna's smile. He climbs into the Caprice. Cerrito

business people, families going on vacations, people living
normal lives who have never used guns to kill people, never
experienced physical violence, some who have never been
stolen from and never steal. Surrounded on all sides by
this flow of normalcy:
HANNA
Seven years in San Quentin. In

NEIL
Yeah.
HANNA
Was McNeil as tough as they say?
NEIL
You looking to become a

HANNA
No. My wife spends half her

her real father's a world class
asshole. And every moment I
got, I'm chasing guys like you.
NEIL
A man told me once: you want to
make moves? Don't keep anything
in your life you're not willing
to walk out on in 30 seconds
flat if you feel the heat around
the corner.

So if you're chasing me and you

Both of these guys look at each other and recognize the
mutuality of their condition. Hanna's light laughter:

NEIL
How soon?
NATE
Twenty-four hours.
NEIL
Make it twelve.
NATE
You're going for an important
ride. If they say twenty-four
for it to be right, then it's
twenty-four!
NEIL
You checked all around?
NATE
All around.
(beat)
You and I go way back, kiddo, I
bought you the best.
Neil says nothing.
Then:
NEIL
Where's the pick-up?
NATE

legit operation. I won't have
details until tomorrow morning.
He hands over a small briefcase.
NATE
(Continuing)
What is it?
NEIL
Kelso's share. Ten per cent.
$400,000. That's less the 50
advance. The other bag was with
Cerrito.
CUT TO:
Farina gets out of an unmarked car with
Charlene Shiherlis
and a sleeping Dominick and they cross
into the building.
It's a rough cedar, two-story studio.
A second car empties
four cops - including Cop $4 and Cop #5
- carrying flack
vests and M-16's. As they confer about
positioning...
CUT TO:
Eady - in her black and red kimono - tears up the steep
hillside of golden fountain grass TO CAMERA from her house
on the side of the hill. We HEAR her BREATHING.

grass.
CLOSE - TWO SHOT
EADY
(explosively
hysterical)
Why you do this to me!
What I

NEIL
Shut up!
She does.
She goes totally blank.
Neil picks her up.
CUT TO:
Basset Hounds BAY. Nate, Neil and Chris walk between the
cages of parked pets - all of whom make a RACKET. The
talk loudly over it. Chris' left arm is in a canvas sling.
His hair has been cut short. He looks different. Dogs
BARK throughout.
NATE
I got Cerrito's share deposited
in the Delaware Trust for Elaine.
She's pretty bad...
(pause)
Passports. Traveler's checks.

Nate leaves.
NEIL + CHRIS

So long, brother.
They embrace.

Green vapor lights have ignited on the freeway behind them.
Neil drops the quarter and dials. Eady sits in the Mercedes -
waiting. Behind them streams of cars and headlights pass
by. We HEAR a PHONE RING.
NATE (V.O.)
(phone filter)
Yeah?
NEIL
(into phone)
Hi ya.
NATE (V. 0.)
(phone filter)
You okay?
NEIL
(into phone)

NATE (V. 0.)

By the by: I heard your pal is
checked into the Airport Hyatt
under "Jamieson"...if you still
care...
Neil doesn't answer.
NATE (V.O.)
(continuing; phone
filter)
I figured you wouldn't waste the
time.
In the background Eady turns on the radio and watches Neil
in the phone booth and rests her chin on her hand on the
door.
NEIL
(into phone)
You figured right.
(smiles)
Take it easy, old man.
NATE
(phone filter; laughs)
You take it easy. Be careful,
huh?
Neil hangs up and turns to Eady.
He stands there.
He
nods.
NEIL
(to Eady)
That was the last bridge.
Eady looks away.
NEIL
gets in and hugs her desperately. It's the most emotional
we've ever seen him. Eady responds not at all. Neil lets
her loose.

The sun is setting beyond Point Dume. Neil and Eady are
at the edge of the sea cliff. He checks his watch. He
looks cut at the sky. He wears clothes Eady bought.
POV: SANTA MONICA BAY
The swells rock a few small boats near the reef: PAN RIGHT.
The sun is gone. The sky To the LEFT the bulk of a 747
rises over the ocean slowly, as if gravity didn't exist.
NEIL
Look over there.
EADY
watches screaming gulls swirling below against the water.
NEIL
(talks to the back
of her)
I don't even know how to think
like this...cause this has
happened to me late in my life.
But I got some expectations.
For us. You can walk right now
if you want. Walk away. Or
you...on your own...you choose
to come with me. I got enough
in there to take care of us for
forever.
There's no response.
NEIL
(continuing)
Eady.
She turns and looks into his eyes.
He touches the side of
her face.
NEIL

She folds into his arms and they stand there against the
darkening sky and red cirrus.
CUT TO:
Neil's Lincoln driven by Chris enters and parks near six
guys playing shirts and skins under two spotlights. He
winces from the pain. His arm is in the sling. He looks
at the piece of paper Nate gave him and looks up TOWARDS

She struggles, but bent double in his arms, she's

with restraining belts. Hanna shoulders them aside and
races into emergency.
CUT TO:
A lot of traffic and lights. Neil drives the Mercedes
past the front and turns left at the corner into a dark

Neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. Hanna still
grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at
the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. The two of
