  Older sister ERICA (17, rebellious and bananas hot) SCREAMS 
  at BEVERLY -- the ultimate smother with frizzy  80s hair.

                                  ERICA
                    You don t know anything!  He s not 
                    too old for me!

                                    BEVERLY
                    He s in college!

                                  ERICA
                    Wrong!  He flunked out to start a 
                    band!  Don t you feel stupid now!

                                    BEVERLY

  The CAMERA hustles through the door into the LIVING ROOM where 
  we find DAD reclining in his La-Z-Boy, clad in TIGHT tightie-
    whities.  Meet hot-tempered, gruff MURRAY (40s).  The pre-
    pubescent CAMERA MAN blocks his view and zooms in and out.

                                  CAMERA MAN (O.S.)
                    Hi, Dad.  You watching TV?  You 
                    watching TV you watching TV you 
                    watching TV youwatchingTVyouwatch--

                    Stop filming me!  You re 
                      aggravating me, you little bastard!  

  The CAMERA pans over to the mirror, REVEALING a reflection of 
  our 11 year-old cameraman, ADAM.  Geeky yet loveable.  He 
    smiles with pure glee, pumping his fist.

                                  ADAM
                    Boom!  Got it on film!

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    The grinning geek is me.  Adam 
                    Silver.  We were the first on our 
                    block to get a video camera -- it 
                    was my only friend.  And I used it 
                    to capture all the crazy.

                                    BEVERLY (O.S.)
                    Murray!  For once in your life, get 
                    off your ass and do something!

                                  MURRAY
                    I m married to you.  That s plenty!

    There s SCREAMING from the DINING ROOM.  Something CRASHES.    
  Adam hustles back in to find Erica FULL NELSON-ING middle 
  child BARRY.  He s a highly-emotional mess of a 16 year-old.  

                                  ERICA
                    He hit me first!  

                                  BARRY
                    Yeah, cause you pulled my hair!

                                    BEVERLY
                    What are you pulling his hair for?  
                    He needs it, it s already thinning!  
                    Now sit down and eat Thanksgiving!

  Barry storms over and roughly GRABS the camera from Adam.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      3.

                    This is how I remember the  80s.  
                    There were no parenting blogs or 
                      participation trophies or peanut 
                      allergies.  Just a ton of yelling 
                    and flip-flops to the head. 

    Beverly kicks off her flip-flop, catches it like a bad-ass in 
    mid-air, and bats her fighting kids with it.  

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    Crazy thing is, each of us became 
                      well-adjusted, successful adults.  
                    But whenever I pop in an old video, 
                    people always ask the same thing...

                                        ACT ONE


  The morning rush.  Erica chugs coffee as Adam tries on high-
    waisted female Jordache jeans.  Beverly fidgets with the zipper.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    October 15th, 1985.  It began as a 
                    typical morning in the Silver house...

                                    BEVERLY
                    See?  Why go shopping when your 
                    sister s jeans fit you perfectly?

                                  ADAM
                    Fit me perfectly?!  They re roomy 
                    in the hips and tight in front!  I 
                    look like Brooke Shields!

                                    BEVERLY
                    Murray!  Go tell Barry to get a 
                    move on!

  We REVEAL Murray in his La-Z-Boy, eating a jelly donut in his 
    tightie-whities.  Shirtless.  Classic dad style.

                                  MURRAY
                    You know the rule!  When I m on the 
                    throne, leave me alone.

                                    BEVERLY (O.S.)
                    That s the toilet!

                                  MURRAY
                    It applies to all thrones!
                          (then, drops a blop of 
                            jelly on his chest hair)
                    Ah, nuts.  


    Beverly barges into the bathroom and casually whips the 
    shower curtain aside.  We REVEAL Barry, shampoo in hair.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Morning, Birthday Boy!  Whattya 
                    want for breakfast?

                                  BARRY
                    I want you to get outta here!  Gah!   How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      5.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    As always, my mom began the day by 
                    dressing us, feeding us and ignoring 
                    any sense of human boundaries.  


    Beverly tapes a giant DOT MATRIX PRINTED BANNER to the wall.  
  It reads  HAPPY 16TH B-DAY, MY BABY .

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    That crispy-haired, overbearing 
                    woman gave everything to her 
                    family.  We didn t want it, but she 
                    gave it anyway. 

                                    BEVERLY
                    There he is!  The big one-six!

    Beverly hands Barry a box of cereal with a bow on it.

                                  BARRY
                    Aw, Honey Comb!  Score!

                                    BEVERLY
                    You know the drill, everyone!  
                    Present time!  

  Adam hands Barry a VHS tape shoddily wrapped in a bow. 

                                  ADAM
                    Here.  It s that tape of you doing 
                    that thing.  You can burn it now.

                                  BARRY
                          (sincere)
                    Thanks.

  Barry turns to Erica as she digs into her pocket.

                                  ERICA
                    Okay, here s my gift.  I saw it at 
                    the mall and thought of you --

  BOOM!  Erica pulls out her FIST and DRILLS Barry in the arm.  
  Adam grins -- until Erica spins on him.  

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    And your birthday s gonna come 
                    early this year if you don t stay 
                    out of my room, little weenie.

  Erica CRACKS her neck.  Adam GULPS in pure terror.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      6.

                    My beautiful, terrifying big sister 
                    Erica.  She gave us that same gift 
                    for the next twenty years.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Okay!  Mom s turn!  This is for 
                    you, my little baby.

    Beverly hands Barry a little wrapped box.  It jingles.

                                  BARRY
                    It s jingling.  It s keys!  Keys 
                    means car!  Car means freedom from 
                    all you monsters!  I love you, Mom!

  Barry rips it open and pulls out -- a locket.  A beat.

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                    The hell is this?

                                    BEVERLY
                    A locket.  It s got my picture 
                    inside.  Now you can always have 
                    your mother near your heart.

                                  BARRY
                    I don t want to be near you!  That s 
                    why I asked for a fucking car!

                                    BEVERLY
                    Oh, sweetie.  You re just not ready 
                    to drive.  You re still too immature 
                    and... a little high-strung.

                                  BARRY
                    I am not!  You are!

  Barry chops the air in a fit.  Adam watches on, delighted.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    My brother Barry.  A grade-A spaz 
                    with major middle child syndrome.  
                    The guy needed some serious meds.  
                    Too bad they weren t invented yet.

                    And finally -- my dad.  A simple man 
                    with simple pleasures.  The kind of 
                    guy who believed pants were the 
                    corporate oppressors of his balls.  

    Murray struggles his way out of his La-Z-Boy.  As a result, 
  Adam catches a good glimpse.  He WINCES.

                    As a result, his balls were the

    Murray tosses Barry a sloppily wrapped birthday gift.

                                  MURRAY
                    Here.  Got this for you.  I think  
                    you re really gonna like it.

    A hopeful Barry tears open a... Mister Mister cassette tape?

                    Mister Mister?!  You don t know me   
                    at all!  I m into new wave synth pop!

                    I went to Sam Goody.  The man there 
                    said it was a hip track.

                                  BARRY
                    The man is wrong.  He knows nothing!

                                  MURRAY
                    You didn t see him!  He had an 
                    earring and wore a jean jacket 
                    covered in buttons!  Covered!

                                    BEVERLY
                    Don t get your father worked up.

                    Too late!  I m all worked up!

                                    BEVERLY
                    Murray, your heart!  Doctor Hong 
                    said you gotta relax.  Breathe!
                          (then, casually to Barry)
                    You re killing your father.  I hope 
                    you re happy.

    Murray takes some deep, soothing breaths.  It doesn t work.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      8.

                    Last year, dad had his third heart 
                    attack.  Doctor s orders were 
                    clear.  No more stress, no more 
                    yelling.  Just one problem.  
                    Yelling was the only way my dad 
                    parented.  It s all the man knew...

                                  MURRAY
                    It s not working!  What does Doctor 
                    Hong know anyway?  No yelling?  I 
                    have kids!

    Suddenly -- someone outside HONKS a CAR HORN.  Over and over.


  Adam and Pops sit in a booth, chowing down on Monte Cristos.  
    A serious convo is going down.  Damn serious.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    Old people water dancing was just

                    the schooling really began.

                    And you can t go in and honk  em.  
                    It s all about cuppage.  Be gentle.  
                    Those puppies are sensitive.

                          (sincere)
                    I just wanna... bury my face in  em.

                                  POPS
                    I know.  We all do.  But you have to 
                    romance  em first.  Speaking of, where 
                    are we on Operation Waffle Girl?

  Adam glances over to ZOE the waitress (15, cute, bubbly).  In 
    dramatic SLOW MO, she scrapes baked beans off a plate into a 
    sludgy trough.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    Her name was Zoe Feldstein.  She 
                    was an older woman.  A freshman.  

                                  ADAM
                    Well, like you said, I m laying the 
                      groundwork.  It s the long con.  

                                  POPS
                    Damn right.  Last week, we told her 
                    your name.  Let s see if it stuck. 
                          (calling to Zoe)
                    Miss?  Can you top me off?

                                  ADAM
                    No!  It s too ballsy!  Pops, pull 
                    the rip cord!  

  Zoe approaches and pours Pops a cup of coffee. 

                                  POPS
                    Thanks.  Really appreciate it. 

  Pops nods to Adam.  He swallows his terror.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      12. 
  2nd Rev. Network Draft 11.27.12                                                                       

                                  ADAM
                    Also... the check please?

                                  ZOE
                    You got it, Alan.

  Zoe heads off.  Adam stares Pops down for a beat.

                                  ADAM
                    That was... rad!  She said my name!

                                  POPS
                    She called you Alan.

                                  ADAM
                    Close enough!  You re a genius, Pops.  

                                  POPS
                    Eh, so the long con will take a 
                    little longer than usual.


  Pops speeds home in his Firebird.  Silent.  Deep in thought.  
  Adam and Barry sit in back, eagerly awaiting his next thought.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    It looked like Pops was cooking up 
                    an epic plan.  That old man had 
                    schemes within schemes.  No one 
                    could compete with his big brain.

                                  BARRY
                    Spill it, Pops.  So, what s the 
                    master plan?  

                                  ADAM
                          (uneasy)
                    Pops?  You okay?

  Pops blinks -- confused and disoriented.  He overshoots the 
  left turn -- totally lost.  BOOM!  HE DRIVES HIS CAR THROUGH 
  THE LIVING ROOM OF A HOUSE!

    A beat as the dust and debris clears, we REVEAL a horrified 
    AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILY sitting in their destroyed living 
  room.  Silence as they gawk at the car.  

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                      Unfortunately, that big brain was 
                    being ravaged by dementia.

  Then -- CLICK!  POPS REACHES OVER AND LOCKS THE DOORS. Barry 
    watches on in horror as Adam slinks low in his seat.  

                                    END OF ACT ONE  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      14. 
  2nd Rev. Network Draft 11.27.12                                                                       

                                        ACT TWO


  Pops, Adam and Barry sit on a bench, heads hung low.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    Pops was booked with reckless 
                      endangerment and we were all thrown 
                    behind bars.  It was ugly alright...

  We PULL BACK through the bars to find Beverly chewing out 
    OFFICER PUCHINSKI (30s), a massive hulk of a cop.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    ... Not for us.  For the poor 
                    officer who had to face my mom.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Are you proud of yourself?  Locking 
                    up an old man and two little boys?  
                    You see the one with the girl 
                    pants?  He s gonna be a big 
                    Hollywood director -- the next 
                    Steven Spielbaum and you treat him 
                    like a common criminal!  I mean, 
                    did you even offer them a sandwich? 

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                    It s not really policy, but I guess 
                    I could whip up a -- 

                                    BEVERLY
                    No!  We don t want your crappy 
                      sandwiches!  I want you to unlock 
                    that door and apologize!

  The officer unlocks the door and nods to Pops and the boys.

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                          (sheepish)
                    I m, uh, sorry.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    As much as we complained, having an 
                      overbearing smother did have its 
                    benefits.

    Beverly wheels on Pops, Adam and Barry.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Car.  NOW.  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      15.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    But they were short-lived.


    Beverly heads inside to find Murray dragging the La-Z-Boy out 
  back to the garbage. 

                                    BEVERLY
                    Oh God.  What are you doing now?  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      18. 
  2nd Rev. Network Draft 11.27.12                                                                       

                                  MURRAY
                    Gonna be damn hard for you to tell 
                    me to go sit in my damn chair when 
                    I burn it in the damn yard!

                                    BEVERLY
                    It s not gonna fit through the 
                    door, Murray.

                                  MURRAY
                    Oh, so now you re also an expert on 
                    spatial relations?  

    FWUMP.  The chair gets completely wedged in the back door.  
  He pushes it with all his might, wedging it further.  

                                    BEVERLY
                    Sweetie, the vein in your head is 
                    popping out.  You need to calm down 
                    or I m calling Doctor Hong.

                                  MURRAY
                    You wouldn t.

    Beverly grabs the phone mounted on the wall and dials!  But 
  it s a rotary phone.  Spin.  Click-click-click.  Spin.  Click-
    click-click.  It s taking forever.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    Fine.  Call Hong.  I ll just tell 
                    him you re using my crappy heart as 
                    an excuse to control this family.

    Beverly hangs up the phone.  It s on.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Excuse me?

                                  MURRAY
                    That s right.  You want me in this 
                    chair -- out of your way -- so you 
                    can run the show around here.  

                                    BEVERLY
                      Riiiiight, it s been a real joy 
                    doing everything in this house.  I 
                    clean, I cook, I carpool, I scrub 
                    all your tire-tracked underpants.

                                  MURRAY
                    Yeah --  cause that s the way you 
                    want it.   How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      19.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Oh, so you think I like scrubbing 
                    your freckled shorts? 

                                  MURRAY
                    I think you love it.  It means you 
                    have all the control!

                                    BEVERLY
                    And apparently, you have none. 

                                  MURRAY
                    Fine.  If you re not calling all 
                    the shots, then let me take Barry 
                    driving.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Are you crazy?  We decided he s not 
                    ready.

                                  MURRAY
                    No.  You decided.  

                                    BEVERLY
                    Yeah,  cause you can t get involved 
                    without blowing your top.  I m just 
                    looking out for you, honey.

                                  MURRAY
                    No, this isn t about me. !Face it, 
                    your whole world s caving in.  
                    Erica s talking about college, 
                    Barry s driving and your little baby 
                    boy s got Playboys under his bed.

                                    BEVERLY
                          (gasps)
                    Not my Adam.

                                  MURRAY
                    There s one thing you can t control 
                    and that s them growing up, Bevy.

    Beverly looks caught -- but won t back down.

                                    BEVERLY
                    You think you can keep your cool 
                    all of a sudden?  Fine.  Good luck 
                    teaching Barry how to drive.

                                  MURRAY
                    Oh, I will.  I ll teach him good.

    Murray storms into the LIVING ROOM where Adam plays Nintendo.  
    Upstairs, we can hear Morrissey playing from Barry s room.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    You.  Erica-Barry-what syourname!  

                                  ADAM
                    Adam?

                                  MURRAY
                    Get me my pants.  

  Adam runs off, a man on a mission.  Murray SCREAMS upstairs:

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    Barry!  Turn off the cry-baby 
                    song and get down here!  We re 
                    going driving.

  Barry pokes his head downstairs, eyes wide.

                                  BARRY
                    Really?
                          (to Beverly)
                    Really?

                                  MURRAY
                    Don t look at her!  Look at me.  
                    Circle of driving, kid.  Let s go 
                    get your license.

  Barry gives a determined nod.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    Just don t be a stupid moron and 
                    make me regret this.

    SUBTITLES: Just don t be a stupid moron and make me regret 
    this... please.


    A trembling Barry is at the wheel, driving TEN MPH.  Cars 
  HONK and ZOOM BY.  Adam sits in back, scared shitless.

                                  MURRAY
                    Brake brake brake!  Let him pass!  
                    LET HIM PASS!  Let the moped pass!

                                  ADAM
                    God, you re awful!  Let me out of 
                    this car!  I can t die before I cup

  As he drives, Barry reaches back and tries to punch Adam.  
    Murray slaps Barry s hands down.

                                  MURRAY
                    No!  Slapping the kids in the back 
                    seat is way too advanced for you!

                                  BARRY
                    Stop screaming!  Mom said you re 
                    not allowed to be screaming!

                                  MURRAY
                    I am not screaming!  MY VOICE IS 
                    RAISED FOR EMPHASIS!  Now pull a   
                    U-ey!  We re going home!

                                  BARRY
                    Home?  No.  This was my one chance 
                    to get my license.

                                  MURRAY
                    And you blew it.  Pull over.

                                  BARRY
                          (freaking out)
                    I can t!  There s too much cars!  
                    It s too much!  It s all too much!

                                  MURRAY
                    Just put it in park!

                                  ADAM
                    Dad, we re in the middle of an 
                      intersection!

    Murray reaches over and throws it in park.  He steps out of 
  the car, calling to passing traffic.

                                  MURRAY
                    Go around!  My son s a moron!

                                  ADAM
                    Know what?  I ll take a bus to the 
                    diner.

  Adam hops out as Murray rounds the front of the car.

                                  MURRAY
                    Get out!  I m taking the wheel!

                                  BARRY
                    No!  You said it was my turn!

    Murray reaches for the driver s side door handle and --

    CLUNK.  Barry locks him out.  He ain't moving.  EVER. 

                      MURRAYBARRY
      Open the door, Barry.  Open No, no, NO!
      the damn door!  Stop saying 
       no  and open it!

                                  ADAM
                    GUYS!  Please!  Stop fighting!

    A beat.  Adam quickly turns on his video camera. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Okay, we re rolling.  Go go go!


    Traffic has slowed to a crawl.  Barry is still locked in the 
    car... as a POLICE CAR rolls up next to Murray.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    It would come to be known as the 
                    great lockout of  85.  My brother 
                    sat stone-faced and silent in that 
                    station wagon with no food and no 
                    water.  Only stubborn teenage angst 
                    to sustain him.

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                    There a problem here?

                                  MURRAY
                    Just out for a nice drive with my 
                    son, Officer.  You know how it is.  
                    You got kids?  Married?  What s 
                    your situation?

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                    The situation is move the car or 
                    I ll impound it.

                                  MURRAY
                    No!  No impounding.  I m handling it.  
                          (breathes deep)
                    Like a Zen master.

    Murray walks calmly to the car and POUNDS on the window.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    I will DESTROY you and all you hold 
                    dear if you don t open the door!  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      23.

                                  BARRY
                    Fine!  Then I ll never get out!  I ll 
                    live here!  This is my home now!

    Murray wheels on Adam, eyes flashing fire.

                                  MURRAY
                        Erica-Beverly-what syourname!  Get 
                    me the crowbar! 

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                    Sir.  I can t let you break a window. 

                                  MURRAY
                    Window?  I m gonna beat his ass 
                    with it.  

    EEEEEERTTT.  Pops  Cadillac pulls up.  A FUMING Beverly is at 
  the wheel, Pops rides shotgun and Erica is in the back.  
    Officer Puchinski and Murray GULP in fear.

                                    OFFICER PUCHINSKI
                    It s the sandwich lady.  This is 
                    bad.

                                  MURRAY
                    How did she -- who called her?

                                  ADAM
                          (grinning)
                    Not me from that pay phone over 
                    there.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    Yup, there were pay phones back then.

    Murray wheels on the car, madly KNOCKING on the window.

                                  MURRAY
                    Barry.  Get out of the car.  Please 
                    get out of the damn car!
                          (glances over at Beverly)
                    In!  Let me in!  We ll both live in 
                    there!  We ll make a wonderful life 
                    for ourselves!  Open up!

  No go.  Beverly is upon him.

                                    BEVERLY
                    So this is what happens when you re 
                    in charge?  A city-wide traffic jam?

                                  MURRAY
                    You can gloat later.  Just do your 
                    mothering thing and get him out of 
                    the car.

                                    BEVERLY
                    Oh no, Mr. Zen Master Man.  You 
                    clean up this mess.  I m going to 
                    the salon to get my hair poofed.  

                                  ADAM
                    Can you drop me and Pops off at 
                    swim class?  It s on the way --

                                  MURRAY
                    Wait!  Don t go.  Albert, help me 
                    out here.  Barry listens to you.  
                    Talk some sense into the boy.

  Pops gives an understanding nod, then screams to Barry:

                                  POPS
                    Fight the power, kiddo!  Don t let 
                    anyone say you can t drive!  It s a 
                    God given right!

  The station wagon suddenly RISES.  We REVEAL it s been hooked 
  up to a tow truck!  It drives off, Barry still inside the car.

                                  BARRY
                    I regret nothiiiiiiing!

    A beat.  Erica leans over to Beverly.

                                  ERICA
                    Since you re already mad -- I m on 
                    the pill.

                                      ACT THREE


  Pops and Adam are back in their booth ordering from Zoe.

                                  ZOE
                    Welcome back, boys.  What ll it be?

                                  POPS
                    I dunno.  What do you think, Alan?

                    Cristos, extra jam.

    Someone pipes in from the next booth -- it s BEVERLY.

                                    BEVERLY
                    He ll have the Mickey Mouse 
                    pancakes.  They re his favorite.

                                  ADAM

                    Can you give us a second?

  Zoe smiles and walks off.  

                                  POPS (CONT D)
                    Bev, we appreciate the ride.  But 
                    we re kinda doing our thing here.

  Adam looks at Pops in a panic.  He covers like a pro.

                                  POPS
                    We re just grabbing a bite before

                    Eating before you go in the pool? 
                    What do you have, a death wish?

                                  ADAM
                    Mom, please.  I can t have you 
                    here.  It s too important.

                                    BEVERLY
                    For what?  Since when did this 
                    waffle hut become a den of secrets?

  Adam nervously glances over at Zoe.  Beverly notices.

                      Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh.  I get it.

                    No.  That s -- crazy.  I don t want 
                    to go out with her.

                                    BEVERLY

                    Yeah!  I m a man now!  A man with

                                  ZOE
                    I ll... come back.

  Zoe hustles off.  A speechless Adam stares Napalm at Beverly.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    Until now, I was always the one 
                    behind the camera.  Wasn t as fun 
                    when I was in the cross-fire of 
                    crazy.  I only had one choice -- 
                    take it like a man.

    A beat.  Adam BURSTS INTO TEARS and runs out.

                                  POPS
                    Well.  There goes the long con.  
                    Months in the making.  Months.

                    This is your fault, you know.  If I 
                    knew this was why you drove him 
                    here, I never would ve allowed it.

  Pops takes a moment, then looks at Beverly.

                                  POPS
                    You wanna know why I won t give up

                                    BEVERLY
                    Dad, I had no idea...

                                  POPS
                    Looks like you got what wanted.  
                    Again.

  Pops heads out.  Beverly watches through the window as Pops 
    comforts Adam with a hug.  She swallows hard, feeling horrible.


  Barry and Murray sit in silence, waiting for their car.  It's 
  tense as hell.  Barry finally snaps, breaking the silence:

                                  BARRY
                    I m sorry, okay?  I spazzed out.  I 
                    always spaz out.  It s what I do!  
                    I m doing it right now!  As always, 
                    it s all my fault!

                                  MURRAY
                    No.  I mean, yes.  But... I didn t 
                    help much.  I shouldn t have yelled 
                    at you, okay? 

                                  BARRY
                    Well, it is your thing.

                                  MURRAY
                    It really is.  Guess your mom was 
                    right. 

                                  BARRY
                    About everything.  I ll never drive. 

                                  MURRAY
                    Any dumb-ass can drive.  Even you.

                                  BARRY
                    Come on, Dad.  You gave me a Mister 
                    Mister tape.  You don t know 
                    anything about me.

                                  MURRAY
                    Trust me.  I do.
                          (exhales deeply, then)
                    I know you go through life feeling 
                    like no one listens... and nothing 
                    goes your way... and you wanna 
                    scream at the world  cause you feel 
                    so damn burned and let down...  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      29.

  Barry looks at his dad, freaked by his insight.

                                  BARRY
                    Maybe.  How did you...

                                  MURRAY
                    When I was your age, all I wanted 
                    to do was shoot hoops.  I even went 
                    to Villanova to play ball.  Figured 
                    it was only a matter of time before 
                    I went pro.

                                  BARRY
                          (looks his dad up and down)
                    What happened?

                                  MURRAY
                    I gave it my all, practiced around 
                    the clock, poured my soul into being 
                    the best -- and turns out -- I suck.  
                    Hard.  I didn t even make the team.

                                  BARRY
                    Wow.  That s a horrible story.

                                  MURRAY
                    I m not finished.  Same week I got 
                    cut, I met your mom.  Fell in love.   
                    Had Erica and you and what s-his-
                    face.  Point is, good things do 
                    happen to guys like us.  You just 
                    can t give up.

  Barry takes this in, Murray s words landing hard.

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    Turns out, our dad did have a good 
                    heart after all.  He just had to 
                    open it up once in a while.

                                  MURRAY
                    I know I don t say it a lot, but... 
                    you re not a total idiot all the time.

    SUBTITLES: I LOVE YOU.

  Barry smiles, touched to the core.  And Murray smiles, proud 
  of his victory.  Just then, the IMPOUND LOT EMPLOYEE pulls up 
  the station wagon.  Murray tosses the car keys to Barry.

                                  MURRAY (CONT D)
                    You wanna drive home?  How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      30.

                                  BARRY
                    Are you gonna scream at me?

                                  MURRAY
                          (tender)
                    You bet I am. 

  As they get in the car, Barry grabs something -- the Mr. Mister 
    casette.  He pops it in.  The epic  80s song  Kyrie  BLASTS.


    Beverly hands Barry a piece of mail.  He opens to finds... 
  his driver s license.  

  Barry celebrates with wild karate kicks as Murray looks on 
    proudly... and Beverly looks on, worried.


  Pops sits alone at the kitchen table.  After a moment, he 
  grabs a pair of scissors and snips his driver s license in 
  two.  He heads over to Erica, asleep on the couch, and gently 
  tucks his car keys into her jacket pocket. 

                                  ADULT ADAM (V.O.)
                    And with that... the circle of 
                    driving was finally complete.  No 
                    matter how hard my mother tried to 
                    pump the brakes.   How the Hell Am I Normal? "Pilot"      32.
