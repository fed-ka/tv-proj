        Brackleykeeps moving, looking down 5 floors to a concrete

      quietly, back-up officers slipping out in eerie silence.

        Brackleyreaches a flat door signed 56 -- he takes up a 
      position on the far side while the rest of the team form up.            "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    7.


      A couple of the squad apply plastic explosive to the door and 
      set up to detonate.

      At the same time, Brackleysnatches a glimpse through a 
      window into the flat.


        BRACKLEY SPOV:

      In a bedroom doorway a young Muslim man (KARIM ALI, 20s) 
      stands with his back to Brackley spov, tightening thick 
      black straps that run over his shoulders and loop round his 
      back and waist.

                                    BRACKLEY
                      Christ -- he s already armed the 
                    bomb.

      They look very wary but all it takes is a nod from Brackley. 

      They detonate the plastic explosive. The door blows off its 
      hinges.

        Brackleyleads the squad through a curtain of smoke. The 
      smoke shows us the red laser target beams from their weapons.

      Red laser dots mottle Karim s head. The squad squeeze their 
      triggers just as Karim turns in terror --

      -- revealing a baby strapped to his front -- 

      -- the straps are a baby sling. 

      But it s too late for Brackley-- he s already pulled the 
      trigger. Karim drops, blood spatters against the back window 
      and the glass shatters. Karim s wife screams and she appears 
      from out of view -- AALIYAH, Asian, 20s-- but the police 
      start to cable-tie her hands behind her back.

      The squad are stunned, paralyzed. Aaliyah is screaming. The 
      baby -- unhurt but splattered with its father s blood -- is 
      crying. And Karim is dead, blood leaking from what s left of 
      his head all over the cheap carpet. There are shouts from 
      outside -- alarmed residents panicking.

        Brackleyshakes, hyperventilating while other members of the 
      squad release the baby from the sling. They pat down Karim.

      Arnott reaches the door of the flat - it s hanging off its 
      hinges. Something about the number doesn t look right to him, 
      which deflects him momentarily, before he plunges into the 
      flat. Through the unit of paramedics fighting vainly to save 
      Karim s life, Arnott sees Karim s widow and the baby.             "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    9.


                                    ARNOTT
                    Oh, my God.

        Brackleyjust shakes his head numbly.

      Arnott moves to the door and reaches for the 6 of the 56. 
      Close-up we can see the faint mark of slightly different 
      weathering above the 6 and a tiny screw hole. 

      Arnott rotates the number upright. It sits next to the 5 --

      -- 59. 

      This is Flat 59.


      ON ARNOTT:

      Arnott shakes. He looks like he ll puke. In b/g the 
        helicopters approach fast (VFX). 

        Brackleysees what Arnott has done. He turns pale like he ll 
      faint. Both men are speechless with horror as the young widow 
      cries, cradling her crying baby next to her husband as 
      paramedics declare him dead.

      Arnott turns and runs.

      EXT. TOWER BLOCK. WALKWAY. CONTINUOUS. DAY 1.1/271/27

      Arnott sprints to the real Flat 56. By now there are loads of 
      cops on the scene, telling panicked residents to stay in 
      their homes. 

      Arnott doesn t wait. He kicks open the door. The flat is 
      empty, stripped of furniture, just a few packing boxes left 
      behind. 

      On a wall is daubed Arabic Jihadistscript.

      Arnott looks like he doesn t know whether to scream or to 
      cry.

      EXT. TOWER BLOCK. LATER THAT DAY. DAY 1.1/281/28

      With a face like thunder, CHIEF INSPECTOR OSBORNE marches 
      through the aftermath:

      -- residents and press being held back by a police cordon

      -- Forensics heading up to the flats

      -- a body bag being taken to an ambulance

      -- Aaliyah, clutching her baby, being led to a police car by 
      two WPCs

      -- Brackleyand his squad clambering numbly into the back of 
      a police van

      Osborne catches the van doors as they re closing, and jumps 
      in.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. POLICE VAN. CONTINUOUS. DAY 1.1/291/29

      The van speeds out of the estate. Brackleyand his squad sit 
      in mortified silence. Osborne doesn t skip a beat.

                                    OSBORNE
                    You got to the flat. You shouted, 
                       Armed police.  You heard something 
                    going on inside, a struggle or a

                    got no choice.

                    I ve got kids of my own, sir. If

                      plated by noon.

      Eyes down, the squad nod to a man. Brackleyhesitates under 
      Osborne s glare, then does the same.

                                                                              CUT TO:          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    11.


      EXT. BACKSTREET. SOME DAYS LATER. DAY 2.1/301/30

      An identical van is let through a police cordon and speeds to 
      a halt outside the rear entrance of a large building.

      The van doors fly open. Brackleyand his squad leap out.

      But they re wearing smart suits, clean shaven, hair combed.

      They straighten their ties and are guided quickly and 
        unobtrusively into the rear entrance of:

      EXT. CORONER S COURT. CONTINUOUS. DAY 2.1/311/31

      The building s imposing public facade. Photographers snap 
      pictures openly. Osborne gives a short statement to the 
      Press.

                                    OSBORNE
                      I take pride in the courage and 
                      professionalism of my 
                        counterterrorism officers. To say 
                    any more risks prejudicing the 
                      inquest.

      Officials, solicitors and witnesses make their way into the 
      building. Police officers, some in suits, some in uniform, 
      march up the steps in groups.

      Alone, hanging back, Arnott doesn t march to the same tune.

      He sees a sorrowful, bent figure, protected by family 
      friends:

      -- Aaliyah.

      Her SOLICITOR speaks to the press on her behalf.

                                    AALIYAH S SOLICITOR

                    it s different. The police don t 
                    break into your house and hurt 
                      innocent people. He told her the

      Arnott moves on quickly, riven by guilt.

      Arnott trudges inside. Osborne hooks his arm and pulls him 
      into an alcove. He waves a statement in his face.

                                    OSBORNE
                    What the bloody hell s this?

                    door. They mistook a baby sling for 
                      a bomb harness.

                                    OSBORNE

      Arnott steps out of the lift onto a high walkway. Glass

      key positions suggest this is a Headquarters Building.

      Coming out of a security door ahead of him is SUPERINTENDANT

                      I don t.

      Hastings doesn t tell him. He studies him.

                                    HASTINGS
                    The bad news, as always with a

      She laughs and shoves him in mock offence. He laughs. 

      She reaches into her purse to settle the bill.

                    I ll call you if I get back before 
                    it s too late ...

      He beats her to paying the bill. She reacts subtly -- his 
      paying is a statement, given their respective wealth.

                                    GATES
                    Maybe we should just dash over to

      at the moment. 

      Nadzia returns to pick up the payment.

      Then out of the window Gates sees a young woman pushing a 
      toddler in a buggy. A couple of youths leap out at her, 
      trying to steal her bag. The woman screams.

      Gates reacts.

      For a  suit , Gates is very handy. He takes a swing at one 
      youth, knocking him to the ground. The second youth pulls a 
      knife. 

      The woman screams. 

      Gates advances, grabbing the knife arm and using his free arm 
      to batter the kid with heavy blows. Meanwhile the first 
      mugger legs it.

      In Gates s eyes dark aggression flashes.          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    18.

      The woman is shocked and tearful but she nods that they re 
      both OK. 

      Nadzia hurries out.

                                    NADZIA
                    The police are coming.

      Gates responds with a wry smile. He shows his police ID.

                      They re already here.

      At a formal event, guests rise from their seats in applause 
      of Gates as he takes to the stage. The Chief Constable puts a 
      medal round his neck and shakes his hand, whispering 
        congratulations. Also on stage applauding is the Mayor. 

      In the audience one man pointedly doesn t applaud -- 
      Hastings, in uniform. He observes coolly, flanked by Arnott.

                    Being a police officer isn t a job.

      we ll meet properly later -- Chief Superintendant Hilton, 
      plus Cottan, Morton and Kapoor. They re laughing at each

                    I m sorry, I m sorry, I panicked.

      She sobs. Backed into a corner, he runs through the options. 
      Tense beats. Her despair works on him. He snatches the keys 
      off her and moves into the hallway. He assesses the layout of 
      the hall, the distance to the door etc.

      He pockets the keys. But he remains visibly alarmed by the 
      hugely dangerous course ahead.

                                    FLEMING
                    Mr. Butterfield, I m Detective 
                      Constable Kate Fleming, Central 
                    CID.

                                  ALF
                      Pleased to meet you.

                                    FLEMING
                            (Sitting.)
                    First let me say how bad I feel for 
                      what s happened to you. It must 
                    have been a very frightening 
                      experience. How are you feeling?

                                  ALF
                            (Shrugs.)
                      I just want summatdone.

                                    LARKIN
                    It d really help us envision your 
                      experience, sir, if we could hear 
                    it at first hand.

                                  ALF
                    What? I came in today because I 
                      thought you d made some progress.

                                    FLEMING
                    I m sorry, Mr. Butterfield, unless 
                    we have hard physical evidence that 
                    leads us to an offender, it s very 
                      difficult --

                                  ALF
                    I ve been burgled three times this 
                    year already. Every time, it s 
                      someone new, who s been given the 
                    file, who wants to  empathise  all 
                    over again. 

        Distraught, Alf gets up to go. He uses a stick. Larkin 
      ignores his slow, painful movements -- Fleming doesn t.

                                    FLEMING
                    Mr. Butterfield, wait. This is my 
                    phone number.
                          (Passes card.)

                    see what we can do to get them this 
                    time.

      Fleming s got through to him. He takes the card. He lingers 
      awkwardly.

      DAY 4.

      CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT DEREK Hilton (spineless, opportunist), a 
      senior uniformed officer, lets Fleming in, shutting the door 
      behind them.

                                    FLEMING
                    You wanted to see me, sir?

                                    HILTON
                      You ve been here, what, 6 weeks, 
                    Kate?

                                    FLEMING
                      A month, sir.

                                    HILTON
                      There s a crime number, DCIGates s 
                      double-arrest outside a cafe in 
                      Kingsgate.

                                    FLEMING
                      I processed the arrests, sir.

                      prohibited weapon, resisting 
                      arrest, all times-two.

                                    FLEMING
                    Yes, sir.

                                    HILTON
                    Two offenders, but only one knife -- 
                    you see my point, Kate? -- they 
                      didn t both use a knife.

                                    HILTON (cont'd)
                    There was an opportunity here with 
                    one of the offenders to miss out 
                    the knife altogether. 

                                    FLEMING
                      I took the view they were both 
                      involved, sir.

                                    HILTON
                      Divisional commanders are on notice 
                    to reduce knife crime. They say 
                      Hillside Lane have already achieved 
                    5 per cent.

                    You want me to recrimeit, sir?

                                    HILTON
                    It s not my policy to intercede in 
                      individual offences.
                          (Passes her the file with

                    Are you ordering me to put it on

      He holds his look on her. She looks bitter.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      Fleming slumps down at her desk in CID. A shoestring budget s 
      been stretched to the limit to provide scuzzy desks, cheap 
      phones, out-of-date IT etc.           "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    27.


      DC  DEEPAKKapoor (late 20s, Asian) strolls past her carrying 
      a tray of posh takeaway coffee. He enters an area divided off 
      by a glass partition signed TO-20. It s like another world -- 
      gleaming new kit, detectives in designer suits. 

      Inside are Gates, DETECTIVE SERGEANT MATTHEW  Dot  Cottan 
      (early 30s) and DETECTIVE CONSTABLE NIGEL MORTON (late 40s, 
      uses walking stick), shuffling through case files.

                                    MORTON
                      Officer of the Year isn t enough 
                    for the boss. He s after the 
                      middleweight title.

      Laughter. Gates throws a combination. Laughter.

                                    COTTAN
                      I heard they gave you more than a 
                    free breakfast. 

      Cottan gestures a hand-job/blow-job. Laughter, while Kapoor 
        distributes the coffees.

                                    MORTON
                    Ta, Deepak.

                      Cheers, mate.

      Fleming watches. Gates sees her and turns away aloofly. 
      Cottan takes the next case file off the top of the pile

      EXT. EDGE PARK. LATER THAT MORNING. DAY 4.1/531/53

      A back road in the vicinity of a well-to-do area. 

      Gates gazes at the body of the middle-aged Asian man lying 
      crumpled against the foot of the hedge. Gates looks like his 
      whole world has caved in.

      A police traffic patrol vehicle blocks the road, engine off, 
      lights flashing. A uniformed Traffic officer takes a 
      statement from a distressed late-middle-aged middle-class 
      woman holding a dog on a lead; a female Traffic Officer, PC 
      Powers, approaches Gates.

                      stolen last night. Signs at the

                    Yes you bloody can, Jackie! A man 
                    is dead. That s one problem - 
                      covering it up is a whole bigger 
                    one. You understand me?

      Gates makes another hard left, accelerating on quickly. She s 
      anguished, conflicted.

                                    GATES
                    YOU UNDERSTAND ME?          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    31.


                                    JACKIE
                    Yes, Tony, yes!

                                    GATES
                    You tell the fewest lies possible  
                    but you say you panicked and now 
                    you want to come clean. Got it?

                                    JACKIE
                    Tony --

                                    GATES
                    GOT IT?

                                    JACKIE
                    Okay, Tony, okay.

      He makes a third hard left, completing a tour round the block 
      back into the high street where he picked her up.

                                    GATES
                    Don t call me, and don t bottle it -
                      - I ve put the case right where I 
                    can keep an eye on it. 

      He brakes hard alongside her roadster. She gets out and he 
      speeds on, his face a grim mask.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. CID/T0-20. LATER THAT DAY. DAY 4.1/551/55

      Kapoor dumps the big pile of cases on a desk. 

                                    KAPOOR
                      Sorry.

      Exit Kapoor.

      DETECTIVE SERGEANT LEAH Janson (early 30s) and Fleming stare 
      at the pile. Various others -- mostly civilians, mostly with 
      hang-dog appearances -- look gloomy.

      Fleming lifts the first file -- the hit-and-run.

                                    FLEMING
                      Hit-and-run? Why us?

                                    JANSON
                      Because we ve got a big sign over

                            (Sighs.)
                    Fine.

                                    JANSON

      The civilian investigator -- RITA BENNETT, middle-aged, 
        overweight, jobsworth-- shuffles from her desk with a bit of 
      paper and all the vigourof a trained slug.

                                    JANSON

                      Anyway, I m out of here.

      Janson turns to look through the glass partition towards TO-
      20. Fleming follows her gaze: Cottan and Morton larking 
      about.

                                    JANSON
                      Gates s had a written warning about 
                    his team s gender balance. I m a 
                      shoe-in.

      Janson looks smug. Envy plays on Fleming s face. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. GATES S OFFICE/CID. LATER THAT DAY. DAY 4.1/561/56

      From his office, Gates watches Jackie being escorted into the 
      CID office by Rita Bennett. Jackie looks very, very nervous. 
      Which makes Gates nervous too. He struggles to keep his eyes 
      on his computer screen.

                                    RITA
                    Have a seat please, Ms. Laverty.

      Jackie sits at the corner of Rita s desk while Rita takes a 
      little too long to track down Jackie s statement on her 
      computer. She hits wrong keys and gets warning bleeps.

                                    RITA
                    There we are. Sorry about that.

                                    JACKIE
                    Yes.

                                    RITA

      Rita enters it on the screen without question.

                                    JACKIE
                    I m sorry, are you one of the 
                      detectives looking into the theft 
                    of my car?

                                    RITA
                      I carry out some forms of police

                    10.06 pmthe night before it was 
                    found abandoned ... ?

      Jackie trembles with nerves. Gates makes brief eye contact 
      with her, nervous as hell too.

                                    JACKIE
                      That s right. I returned home from 
                      a business trip around nine, but 
                    later I remembered I d left 
                      something in the car. When I went 
                    to pick up the keys, they were 
                    gone, and they d broken part of the 
                      window in my front door.

      Rita clacks the keyboards.

                                    RITA
                    They hooked the keys off the hall 
                      table. You didn t hear anything?

      Jackie hesitates. Gates s eyes are all over her.

                                    JACKIE
                    I was in a back room of the house, 
                    with music playing.           "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    34.


      Satisfied, Rita clacks her keyboard while Jackie tries to 
      maintain her composure. 

      Gates can tell there hasn t been a shock confession. He looks 
      mortified.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. KINGSGATE. LAY-BY. DAY 4.1/571/57

      Traffic whips by on a busy dual carriageway. Gates s car 
      pulls up behind Jackie s parked roadster. She gets out as he 
      does. He pulls her quickly away from the road, into the 
      shadows.

                                    GATES
                    What the hell are you playing at?

                                    JACKIE
                    The woman seemed so convinced. She 
                    made it impossible to change the 
                      story.

                                    GATES
                    You don t change, do you? Look 
                    after number one. Wreck my life and 
                    leave me to pick up the pieces. 
                    Same old Jackie, played me for a 
                    mug.

                                    JACKIE
                    No, Tony, no. I ll fix it. I ll 
                    find a way. 

                                    GATES
                    What, like today?

      He pushes her off and heads back towards his car.

                                    JACKIE
                    I ll take the blame. I ll go to 
                      prison if that s what you want.

      The last line hits him, makes him pull up.

      We keep looking at them on a long lens from the other side of 
      the road, as traffic speeds in between, two people who care 
      about each other but caught up in a terrible dilemma. They 
      want to move towards each other, then apart, their conflicts 
      playing out.

                                                                              CUT TO:          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    35.

      Arnott and Hastings stroll into reception. Straight ahead is 
      public access to a secure desk; to the right is police access 
      to a security entrance.

      Hastings  phone rings.

                        Superintendent Hastings.

      Hastings steps back out to take the call. A fraction of a 
      second later, Fleming comes out of the police door. 

      Arnott checks her out.

                                    ARNOTT

                    Okay. 

      Fleming leads him towards the police access door.

      She tries her fob but it doesn t work first time.

                                    FLEMING
                    They said they were getting this 
                      fixed.

                    I m fine, thanks, Fleming.

      Arnott tries to catch Fleming s eye with a mollifying smile. 
      She pointedly ignores him and exits.

      Gates shakes hands. He sits down, smiles, adopts a friendly 
      and confident posture.

                                    GATES
                      I recognise and respect the 
                      importance of your mission. I m 
                    very happy to help in any way I 
                    can.

                                    HASTINGS
                      That s very reassuring, ... Can I 
                    call you Tony?

      Gates laughs along with the joke but doesn t like it.

      Arnott starts looking embarrassed and awkward.

                                    HASTINGS
                    May I start?

                                    GATES
                    Of course, sir.

      Hasting starts the tape recorder. Gates starts looking 
      properly nervous.

      Hastings passes Gates the charge in writing.

                    Yes.

      Gates grins from ear to ear before returning to professional 
      autopilot. He takes the document.

                      Sorry, Tony, we have to go through 
                    the motions.

                    Not your fault, sir.

      Gates shakes hands and exits briskly.

      Hastings gathers his materials. He glances at Arnott. Arnott 
      remains seated in the same mood of sulky embarrassment.

                      A player like Gates knows it s 
                      against regs not to declare a 
                      gratuity. So what does it tell us 
                    that Gates didn t bother to fill in 
                    the form?

      INT. CID CORRIDOR/GATES S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS. DAY 5.1/631/63

      Gates strolls along the corridor. A couple of detectives hold 
      out their hands and he gives them high/low-fives. He returns 
      to his office calmly.

      Fleming taps away at her keyboard, updating the unsolved 
      burglaries with lines like  no further information available  
       offender undetected   IPunwilling to assist . The 
      undetected cases have big red markings on them.

      She waits expecting more from him, such as an invitation to 
      get involved, but nothing is forthcoming. So she comes right 
      out with it.

      Gates gives nothing more away. She exits. He watches her go, 
      but his desire is dark.

      Fleming retakes her position at CID. Janson slaps a hand down 
      on her desk, standing right over her.

      As soon as other officers clock them, they move out of their

                      Lager. Pint. Thanks, sir.

      Hastings moves to the bar to order. 

      Arnott feels Janson s eyes on him. He sees her whisper 
      something to one of the other women, while looking his way, 
      and they chuckle.

      He can t work out if she fancies him or is taking the piss.

      Fleming joins Janson s group. She follows her gaze to Arnott, 
      and then she sees Hastings.

                    This place has gone downhill.

      Fleming takes the last gulp of her drink and heads out.

      Arnott watches her go.

      Hastings turns from the bar with a pint in each hand.          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    45.


      Arnott has vanished.

      left alone to reflect.

      EXT. POLICE STATION. CAR PARK. NEXT DAY. DAY 6.1/661/66

      From his parked car, Arnott watches Gates pull up. Arnott 
      gets out. Gates wants nothing to do with him. He walks 
      briskly through the car park with Arnott in pursuit.

                                    ARNOTT
                    Wait, sir, listen.

                    I can throw down a harassment

                                    ARNOTT
                      A minute of your time. Please, sir.

                                    GATES
                    Some of us have got proper work to 
                    do.

                                    ARNOTT
                      I can t believe you re stuck-on for 
                    this. 

      That makes Gates pause.

                      Hastings gives a toss about you 
                      having a free egg and bacon. I 
                      don t. I just want to make the 
                      yellow notice go away so we can 
                    both get on with investigating real 
                      crime. 

                                    GATES
                      Hastings has got you playing mind-
                      games. 

                                    ARNOTT
                    A few weeks ago I was running 
                        counter-terror ops. I m a proper

                    You can make Hastings back off?

                                    ARNOTT
                    I can certainly try, sir. Off the

                    Don t I bloody know it!

      The lighter touch convinces Gates. He warms up. 

                                    ARNOTT
                    Why didn t you log the gratuity, 
                    sir?

                                    GATES
                      I forgot. Crapexcuse, I know, 
                    mate. But it s the truth.

      Arnott nods. 

      Gates nods briskly in return then hurries into the station. 
      Arnott contemplates his bargain with some trepidation.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      Arnott enters the office, wearing the same look of 
        trepidation. Hastings spots him immediately and comes out of 
      his office.

                                    HASTINGS
                      Perfect timing, Steve. What d you
                    have to tell me about Tony Gates?

                                    ARNOTT
                    Uh ...

                                    HASTINGS
                      Nothing? Steve, what can I say? I m 
                      disappointed.

      Hastings leads Arnott back out.

                                    ARNOTT

                    Are you? That s what I need to 
                    know, Steve.

      Arnott's pcunease simmers, but Hastings maintains a neutral 
      silence as they exit.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. AC-12. WALKWAY. CONTINUOUS. DAY 6.1/681/68

      Hastings leads Arnott onto the walkway. He watches a lift 
      ascend from the ground floor. A few uniformed officers are 
      visible in the lobby, to maintain the impression of a 
        headquarters building.

                                    ARNOTT
                      Frankly, sir, so what if Gates had 
                      a free breakfast?

                                    HASTINGS
                    We should cut him some slack, you 
                    mean? Turn a blind eye because he s 
                    one of ours?

      Arnott glowers.

      The lift door opens.

      Out steps Gates, flanked by his Police Federation rep, DCI
      ALICE PRIOR (40s).

                                    HASTINGS
                      Alice, what a lovely surprise. I ll 
                    have to be on my toes today.

                      You ve always been a lovely mover, 
                    sir.

      Laughter. Hastings shakes hands with Gates.

                                    HASTINGS
                    Come along, Tony, make yourself at

                                    GATES
                    Thank you, sir.

      Hastings leads Gates and Prior towards the entrance to AC-12. 
      Arnott is nonplussed. 

                                    GATES
                    I was surprised to be called in

      As Gates passes, he gives Arnott an expectant look -- he 
      thinks they have a deal. 

      Arnott isn t so sure any more.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      Gates s shocked and angry. He turns his glare on Arnott. 
      Arnott shifts uncomfortably.

                    We don t recognise DCIGates as a 
                      threat to the public or his fellow 
                      officers. Why should our citizens

                    My best mate, we went through

      Loyal and professional, both Cottan and Morton give nods of 
      assurance.

      Kapoor points away from the bar and Fleming follows his 
      finger to Gates, Morton and Cottan. They make room for her 
      and she sits down.

      She takes one half, and the boys make a noise of being 
        underwhelmed. She takes the second, one in each fist, and the 
      boys give her due acknowledgement.

      Meanwhile Gates sticks a yellow Post-it note on his forehead. 
      Raucous laughter.

      The facade has dropped from his face as Gates lets himself in 
      via the front door. His daughters -- Natalie, 9, and Chloe, 7 
      -- run downstairs to hug him. The dog sniffs round his 
      ankles. Jools is in the kitchen.

      Natalie skips away excitedly. Jools studies Gates. He puts on 
      a brave face.

      impossible to suppress.

      Arnott shuts it all down, scoops a few personal items into 
      his pockets, and exits.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                    Come with me.

      They get into the lift. Arnott is suddenly very curious. The 
      lift goes up.

                    All this just to bring down Gates? 
                      Instead of spending all this time 
                    and money policing the police, it d

      station;

      -- Edge Park -- leafy, well-to-do;

      Gates indicates a particular sink estate in Moss Heath -- the

                    No, I m Spartacus.

      Gates laughs with them.

      Fleming shows a flash of concern for Arnott as she watches 
      him walk away.

      The screen fills with matches.

      The cases are listed by most recent first: top of the list is 
      the car-jacking, followed by the double arrest for the 
      mugging outside the cafe.

      He opens the first entry.

      Arnott opens a notepad, writes a heading:

      A drug dealer we ll meet again later -- WESLEY DUKE (20s) -- 
      slips one of the street-walkers a wrap of crack in exchange

      In an unmarked car, Cottan snaps a photo on a very long lens, 
      Morton at his side watching through binoculars.

                                    MORTON
                    Our old friend Wesley Duke, with a 
                    big fat rucksack full of crack 
                      cocaine. While you were all tucked 
                    up in your warm beds --

                                    GATES
                    You were tucked up with Dot.

      Laughter.

                    -- Dot and me traced the source 
                    back to this address --

      Further pictures repeat the images of Wesley at the semi; in 
      the doorway are two figures who are almost impossible to make 
      out except they re dark-skinned and wear hoodies.

                                    MORTON
                    - 161 Green Lane. Wesley s been 
                      small-time but this appears to be a 
                    new, large-scale supply he s tapped 
                    into. Next stage would be to pick 
                    up Wesley and turn him.

                                    FLEMING
                    What if he blabs? We don t want to 
                    alert the Green Lane mob to us 
                      watching them.

                                    GATES
                      I agree. Keep up the surveillance 
                    for now. Let s see who else comes 
                    and goes from this address.
                          (To Morton.)
                    Tah, Nige.

      Morton starts to turn off the visual aids.

                                    GATES
                    Leave them, Nige.

      The team disperses but Gates remains in the room, troubled, 
      pensive. He keys the remote control and goes back to the only 
      image that shows the shadowy figures in the doorway of the 
      semi. Fleming is last to exit.

                                    GATES

      Exit Fleming. Gates glances at the photos again, intrigued by 
      these new kids on the block.

      Gates slips covers over his shoes and then walks in through 
      the front door of No. 161.

      In the hallway, well back from the living room, are Morton, 
      Cottan and Fleming, covers over their clothes.

                      Morning, boss.

      Gates doesn t answer, peers into the living room grimly -- 
      two dead Asian men, tied to chairs, dead from multiple stab 
      wounds. There s a lot of blood. Both men have had all their 
      fingers cut off, which lie on the carpet round them, being 
      bagged one by one by FSI sin white suits.

      Cottan looks very, very sheepish.

                                    COTTAN
                    Tone, I don t know what to say,

                      Later, Dot, alright.

      Cottan nods, hangs his head sheepishly.

                                    FLEMING
                    From the blood spatter both men 
                    were alive when the fingers were 
                      amputated. Looks like whoever 
                      killed them wanted to know 
                      something, and didn t find out.

                                    GATES
                    The finger amputations are clean. 
                    Each one done with a single stroke. 
                    Most likely with a bolt-cutter. 
                    Dot, go through the files back at

                    The lads in that house were new

      He exits. Fleming watches him go, even more fascinated by 
      Gates than she was.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                    What goes around comes around.

      Janson exits with a sneer. Fleming goes in. Alf Butterfield 
      is inside, being comforted by Larkin. Alf has a black eye and 
      a cut lip.

                    Mr. Butterfield, I m very sorry --

      Enter Hilton, at the door, beckoning Fleming out. They talk

                    Sir, with respect, you told me to

                      I told you to prioritize. 

      Butter wouldn t melt in Hilton s mouth. He exits. Fleming 
      looks very bitter.

      INT. CID. SAME TIME. DAY 9.1/891/89

      Rita clicks open the image for Gates. Gates looks very 
      uneasy. 

                                    RITA
                    This missing persons report came 
                      through from County CID.

      She opens a missing persons file on someone called GURJIT
      PATEL. Switching between the morgue images of the dead man 
      and GurjitPatelwe see they re one and the same.

                                    RITA(cont d)
                      GurjitPatelwent missing the day 
                      before the hit and run. MrPatel
                    was an accountant for Laverty
                      Holdings.

      Gates turns from uneasy to ashen.

      Rita calls up the file image for Jackie Laverty.

                                    RITA(cont d)
                      LavertyHoldings is owned by

                                    GATES
                      Thanks, Rita. My squad s taking 
                    over this case from now on. Leave 
                    it to me to inform County we ve got 
                    an ID. 

                                    RITA
                    Yes -- of course --

                                    GATES
                    It s a sensitive case. I need to 
                    shoot these files to my computer. 
                    May I?          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    66A.


                                    RITA
                    Yes, sir -- of course.          "Line of Duty" Episode 1 Shooting Script 18.08.11    67.


      He takes her seat.

                    Milk, no sugar.

      Rita complies, happy to do so and not one bit suspicious. As 
      soon as Rita reaches the kitchen, Gates highlights the 
      section relating to GurjitPatel.

      The enormous dilemma plays on Gates s face. He looks like his 
      world is about to cave in.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      Arnott exits the previous case, back to the main list of 
      Gates s cases. There s a new one at the top, the most recent:

      -- HIT AND RUN

      Arnott is curious and a little puzzled.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      Arnott's finger hovers over the mouse, ready to open the 
      file.

                                                                              CUT TO:
