IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down
the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road
and through a massive field of emptiness.
The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of
the car.
Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
General scans his surroundings with concern.
TITLE CARD UP: THE PAST
Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL
HATCH in the ground. Both men walk down the hatch and
into the earth.
Dale, wearing a name tag that reads "Garth", holding a
clip board and wearing a greenpeace hat, knocks
repeatedly on the door. A woman cautiously answers the
door.
WOMAN
Um, I didn't order a pizza.
DALE
Excuse me, miss? Are you Sandra Danby
5
WOMAN
Uh...yea-
Dale shoves an envelope into her hand.
DALE
Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up
to your divorce proceedings 4 times under
court order. You've been served.
WOMAN
Oh great! Thanks a lot asshole! Real
clever! Go fuck yourself!
Dale dashes back to his car as the upset woman starts to
open the envelope.
Dale gets out of his car, followed by some plumes of
smoke, and goes to his trunk. He chuckles as he takes out
a lab coat and walks towards the hospital.
Dale, wearing a chauffeur hat, stands by the main
entrance holding a sign that reads: JOSH CORBER. A man
walks out of the hotel and, seeing the sign, approaches
Dale.
CORBER
My name's Corber.
DALE
You're Joshua Aaron Corber?
CORBER
(overjoyed)
Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't
she? I was just telling her before I left
how I've never been in a limo. Can you
believe it? 35 and I've never been in a
limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?
Dale hands him a BLUE ENVELOPE.
DALE
Sorry, but you've been served.
Dale walks away. CORBER opens the envelope and reads it.
CORBER
Ah fuck!
(reads more)
Fuck! You fucking asshole!!! FUCK!
9
Dale completely ignores Corber as he dumps the sign and
walks out of the airport. Then, a huge smile comes across
his face. He has noticed a nearby Burger King.
DALE
(excited)
Hey! Nice. New chicken fries.
He happily walks toward the food.
INT - DALE'S CAR - DAY
Dale sits in his car
outside a high school. An array of
Burger King wrappers
surrounds him as he rolls a joint
with the last of his
weed on top of a Batman comic. He
lights the joint and
turns on the radio.
RADIO DJ
...3:09 in the PM and we-
Dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then
snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather
kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand
sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash
and breath mints.
Dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet
naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in
his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all
over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes.
He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some
cologne, and then gets out of the car.
Dale walks towards the school.
ANGIE
Dale!
Dale turns to see his attractive 19 year old girlfriend,
ANGIE ANDERSON, walking towards him with her group of
friends. She kisses him.
ANGIE (CONT'D)
Mmm. Minty.
ANGIE'S MALE FRIEND
Yo Dale. `sup.
10
DALE
Hey Kyle.
(to Angie)
So, should we head back to my place and
finish up the trilogy? Matrix:
Revolution. Whose it gonna be, Angie? Man
or machine?
ANGIE
Of course. But can we just head to my
locker first? I left some stuff by
mistake.
DALE
Sure.
The car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit
woods. Dale paces back and forth as Saul walks over.
DALE
So what do we know? Nothing. We may or
may not be followed because we don't even
know if he found the roach or not. And,
we could just be completely crazy. But,
the question is this: even if he found
the roach, how could he know where you
were?
SAUL
(thrilled)
He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's
impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on
the bottom of the car or some shit, but I
mean-
30
DALE
No, what I mean is, if Ted found the
roach and identified the weed, how could
he connect it to you?
SAUL
There's no way. He could only find out
from Red.
DALE
Who is this Red guy?
SAUL
Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted
and guys like me. And we're mad fucking
tight. One time he convinced some girl he
knew to give me a hand-job within, like,
five minutes of me meeting her.
DALE
But let's say someone calls asking who he
sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say
you, because...why wouldn't he?
SAUL
Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have
called me if that happened. A hand-job,
Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand
job by now!
DALE
Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug
dealer.
SAUL
So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you
don't trust me then?
Saul stares at Dale, who doesn't know how to respond.
DALE
Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him.
SAUL
Thank you!
Pleased, Saul pats Dale on the back.
DALE
You're right. You are. I'm just being
paranoid. Sorry, dude.
31
Saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. We
hear someone pick up.
RED (O.S.)
(through phone)
Ow! Hello?
SAUL
Yo, Red. You okay man?
RED (O.S.)
Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe.
Red sounds nervous.
SAUL
Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the
house. But Red, I gotta get straight to
brass tacs, I need a favor.
RED (O.S.)
Sure man, anything. I'm Red.
SAUL
You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know
how you gave me some of that pineapple
express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave
it to me.
RED (O.S.)
Sure man, no problem. Red swears it,
hombre.
SAUL
So, can I come on over now?
Dale waves his hands in front of Saul's face.
DALE
(louldy whispering)
No! We should do it tomorrow!
SAUL
(covering phone, talks to
Dale)
I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's
just go and get this shit over with.
DALE
Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared
shitless. I want to think things through
before I do anything. Let's go in the
morning. Please.
32
Saul looks around the dark forest.
SAUL
Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in
the day.
Dale nods.
SAUL (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Red?
RED (O.S.)
(talking to someone else)
-I can hear him talking to someone, so-
Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the
morning?
SAUL
Yeah, right after I see my grandma.
RED (O.S.)
Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow!
Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is
that the one on Granville and 41st.
SAUL
Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be
chillin' by noon.
Saul gives Dale the thumbs up.
RED (O.S.)
Well, cool brother. Noon it is.
SAUL
We should definitely hit up the casino
again sometime.
RED (O.S.)
For sure. We should definitely hit up the
casino.
Saul hangs up the cell.
SAUL
Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone
cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the
house.
33
SAUL
I always liked smoking weed in the
forest.
Saul lights a joint and starts smoking. He passes it to
Dale. Dale puffs. They look around at their expansive,
dark surroundings and immediately become overwhelmed with
paranoia. Saul notices a shooting star zip across the sky
as Dale takes out his cell phone.
DALE
I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some
bull shit.
As Dale dials, Saul, paranoid from the pot, looks at his
cell phone. He takes another hit, and then looks up to
the sky again. He looks back at Dale's phone. Dale starts
to walk off.
34
SAUL
Dale...wait!
Saul snubs out the joint and runs over to Dale.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know
how this shit works, but...can cops...
you said they might be cops...could they
triangulate our phones or trace `em or
some shit like that? I don't know. I feel
like I've seen that.
Dale stares at Saul, then flips open his phone -
beep
SAUL (CONT'D)
I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace
them when we're not even on them!
Dale takes a hit as he looks up to the sky. Just then, a
loud rumbling noise is heard.
DALE
What the fuck is that?!
The rumbling gets louder.
DALE (CONT'D)
Are we on fucking "Lost"?! What the hell
is that?!
SAUL
It's them!!!
The noise builds to a deafening crescendo as the guys
dive behind a tree stump. A moment later, a JUMBO JET
buzzes overhead, heading towards the nearby airport. Dale
and Saul pop up.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Holy fuck. That was close.
DALE
(clutching cell phone)
You know what? You're right. We should
just get rid of them. We should just
smash `em.
Dale looks at his phone, which is a new, expensive Razor.
DALE (CONT'D)
Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I
can just take the batteries out?
35
SAUL
No! Smash it!
Dale sighs, then SMASHES his phone on a rock. Saul looks
at Dale, then HURLS his phone into the woods as hard as
he can, sending it SAILING into the FOREST.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Shit!
DALE
What the fuck was that?!
Dale tosses the joint aside.
SAUL
Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that
tree!
DALE
What tree?
SAUL
That one.
Saul points out a group of trees about 30 feet away.
SAUL (CONT'D)
It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free
with the plan. It must've smashed when it
landed.
DALE
Who the fuck knows?!? I don't know!! Why
couldn't you have just smashed it on a
rock like a normal person?
SAUL
I was trying to smash it! How often does
a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck.
DALE
Did you at least see where it landed?
SAUL
Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could
call it!
DALE
With what? I just smashed my phone!
They look into the scary dark depths of the woods. Both
of them are clearly terrified.
36
SAUL
Man, it's not like they got McGuyver
workin' on the case. I bet they can't
even triangulate it.
DALE
Well, then you shouldn't have said
anything, cause now you've convinced me
that they can!
SAUL
Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid
thing and get back to doing what we were
doin'.
Horrified, they cautiously inch into the forest.
DALE
Do you see it?
SAUL
Dude, this is the scariest place I've
ever been in my life.
They nervously walk on.
SAUL (CONT'D)
You ever see that movie where all the
people are in the woods and they slowly
get killed?
DALE
The "Blair Witch Project."
SAUL
No...Shit. That one's way scarier than
the one I was thinking of. Mine had
Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm
thinking of the fucking Blair Witch.
They inch forward, nervous.
DALE
(whispering)
Stop!
They both freeze.
SAUL
(whispering)
What-
37
DALE
(whispering)
Sshh!
SAUL
(whispering)
What is-
DALE
(whispering)
Sshh! Can you hear that?
SAUL
(whispering)
What?
DALE
(whispering)
Just listen.
Saul listens.
SAUL
(whispering)
I literally hear nothing.
(gasp)
Wait...
SUDDENLY, Saul SPRINTS off into the darkness!
DALE
SAUL!!!
Dale looks in horror as Saul vanishes amongst the trees.
SAUL(O.S.)
(screaming in pain)
ARGHHH!!!
Dale hears a loud THUD.
Scared for his life, he SPRINTS in the opposite
direction! He weaves in between the trees, avoids some
rocks and tree roots, stumbles on some loose dirt, then
SLAMS half his body against a tree and FALLS HARD.
ANGLE ON: SAUL
Saul gets up, covered in dirt. Panting, he looks around
the forest and sees no one. He thinks he hears something
and SPRINTS off! WHAM! He trips on a tree root and SLAMS
into the ground.
38
ANGLE ON: DALE
Dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe
the dirt off his suit.
DALE
Shit.
Saul hears Dale and whips around, breaking a twig -
CRACK
Dale looks towards the noise, then SPRINTS off.
Saul hears someone and BOLTS in the opposite direction.
Like chickens with their heads cut off, they both
scramble through the woods trying to evade their
imaginary enemies.
Dale spots his car! He jumps in and SLAMS the door shut.
He's about to turn the ignition, but stops. Panting and
wheezing, he sinks into his seat.
BAM! Something slams into the car.
DALE (CONT'D)
AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
Dale sees Saul BANGING against the passenger side door.
SAUL
(muffled through the window)
Let me in! Let me in!
Dale unlocks the car and Saul JUMPS in.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Let's go! Go!
DALE
Is there anyone even out there?!?
SAUL
I don't know!
DALE
If you don't know then why the hell did
you run like that?!?
SAUL
I don't know! I'm freaking out, man!
Let's just go!
39
DALE
No! We're not going anywhere!
SAUL
But there could be something out there!
DALE
There's nothing out there, that's why
we're here. God, man, you scared the
fucking shit out of me.
SAUL
Well, I'm not getting out of the car. I'm
staying in the car.
A moment of silence. They both look around. There is
clearly nothing out there. Dale turns on the car. Talk
radio comes on.
RADIO DJ
-white accent walls would go nice with a
dark colored room, say a burnt sienna,
but don't forget...
SAUL
Talk radio? You fuckin' joshin' me? Why
don't we just shoot ourselves in the
nuts?
DALE
Shut up, okay? It's my car.
SAUL
Fine. Well, I'm going to smoke a joint
before I go to sleep, and don't worry
about it, even though you're being a
dick, it's on the house.
DALE
Don't do me any fucking favors. I got my
own.
SAUL
Thanks to me!
DALE
Shut up.
Dale and Saul start rolling separate joints.
40
Dale slowly wakes up. He stretches, and then shakes Saul.
DALE
Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.
Saul opens his eyes and realizes where he is.
SAUL
Fuck me.
DALE
What's the time?
SAUL
(groggy)
It's too early.
Saul brings his wrist up close to his eyes.
SAUL (CONT'D)
It's...
Saul stares at his watch, confused.
SAUL (CONT'D)
This can't be right.
DALE
What does it say?
SAUL
It says, uh...
Saul looks outside towards the sun.
SAUL (CONT'D)
It couldn't be three in the morning,
could it?
DALE
It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to
be there at noon!
SAUL
(excited)
Wait! My grandma's clocks! It's daylight
savings!
(beat)
Fuck! No! They go forwards an hour!
Dammit-
41
DALE
It's four o'fucking clock?!
SAUL
-I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And
we've gotta call Red.
DALE
(angry)
How?
Dale digs in his pockets for the keys.
SAUL
We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number
was in my phone!
Dale notices the keys are in the ignition.
DALE
You remember where he lives, right?
SAUL
Yes, I remember. What the hell is that
supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm
forgetful? That's right, I know the word
insinuating.
DALE
Let's just get out of here.
He turns the keys. NOTHING. He tries again. NOTHING.
DALE (CONT'D)
What the fuck? Come on.
He tries twice more, but nothing happens.
DALE (CONT'D)
(pissed off)
I think the battery's dead.
SAUL
Are you fucking serious?
He tries again.
DALE
It's dead.
SAUL
It's dead?
42
Dale shoots Saul an angry look.
SAUL (CONT'D)
What the fuck happened? How did this
happen?
DALE
How? We fell asleep!
SAUL
Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No
surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put
people to sleep.
Frustrated, Dale tries to gather his thoughts.
DALE
We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll
walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's.
SAUL
For real?
Dale opens his door and hops out.
DALE
Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but
we'll get there. Then we can fix this
insane situation.
MONTAGE:
- Dale and Saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road,
each smoking their own joint.
- Saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf.
Dale is grossed out. Saul pokes the caterpillar and then
blows weed smoke onto it.
DALE (CONT'D)
Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave
that thing alone.
- They emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride.
- Dale notices Saul has his thumb sticking out of his
zipper.
SAUL
It's like, my thumb is my cock!
Dale doesn't laugh.
43
- Bored and tired, they wait.
Saul lights a joint. Dale
notices. Saul shifts his body
away from Dale. Just then,
an eighteen wheeler slows for
them. Saul snubs out the
freshly lit joint and puts it
in his pocket.
Dale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler.
SAUL
(to the driver)
Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid.
Saul shuts the door and he and Dale run towards Red's
house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of
town. Exhausted, Dale and Saul reach Red's door. Saul
knocks.
DALE
So, what's this guy like?
SAUL
I don't know. He's short...and stout. So
he's like a tea pot. Hehe.
DALE
Well, do you think he'll be there?
SAUL
I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight
hours late.
(beat)
That's actually pretty late.
RED (O.S.)
(through door)
Who is it?
SAUL
Red! It's Saul. Open up.
Red opens the door. He has a SPLIT LIP and has clearly
been CRYING. He tries to act normal. Dale immediately
suspects something is up.
RED
(sniffling)
Who's this guy?
DALE
Dale. Nice to meet you.
44
Red ushers them in and shuts the door.
RED
Dale who?
DALE
I think it's
better if you don't know my
last-
SAUL
(oblivious)
Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.
Red notices their dirty clothes.
RED
(to Saul)
What happened to your clothes? Where'd
you call me from, man?
Dale notices Red quivering as he lights a cigarette and
becomes increasingly suspicious.
SAUL
We were in the forest laying low.
Thinking.
DALE
Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?
Saul finally notices Red's dishevelled appearance.
SAUL
Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?
RED
What? Oh, I uh...
(feeling his split lip)
...I got a cold sore, I've never got one
before. I started crying.
SAUL
A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?
RED
...uh, yeah, man.
SAUL
Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how
many joints we've shared? I told you,
man. This is from that time you ate the
lollypop straight from the strippers sna-
45
DALE
Saul. Ask him.
SAUL
(to Dale)
Okay, Captain Demando. Can you just chill
out, maybe? So, Red. I gotta ask-
RED
Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all
about? That's what I want to know.
SAUL
Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for
protest lawyers, and-
DALE
Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well,
Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't
think we should tell you any more than
you need to know.
RED
Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I
deserve to know.
SAUL
Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his
house.
DALE
Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you
into the shit we're in. It's just
trouble.
SAUL
Don't be weird about this. If he wants
trouble, it's his right to have it.
RED
Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble.
DALE
That's why we only need to clarify one
thing - nobody's called about Saul or the
pineapple express or anything like that?
RED
No one. Nada.
46
SAUL
Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine.
We had a crazy night in the woods, which
I assume we can both put behind us like
grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant
bong to get super-duper high.
Dale doesn't seem convinced. Saul picks up Red's huge
bong and starts to pack a bit of Red's weed into it.
RED
Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at
home. I'm just going to use the ol'
telephone-o.
Saul sits down and picks up a lighter as Red walks
towards the phone. Dale watches Red, suspicious of his
odd behavior. Red begins to dial...
SMACK! Dale knocks the phone out of Red's hand.
RED (CONT'D)
What the fuck!
Saul jumps up. Dale SNATCHES the phone and backs up.
DALE
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
SAUL
Dale!
What the fuck are you doing?
DALE
(to Saul)
We can't let him call anyone! He's acting
weird!
RED
Fuck you man - this is my house!
DALE
I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-
SAUL
Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and
paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy!
(to Red)
I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought
this guy over here, he's a total lunatic.
Without warning, Red grabs a LARGE ASHTRAY filled with
cigarette butts and WHIPS it at Dale. BAM! It smashes him
in the head!!!
47
DALE
(in pain)
AAAHHH!
Ash EXPLODES everywhere as Dale drops the phone and
clutches his head.
SAUL
Holy cock!
Red approaches the cowering Dale. Saul intercedes.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Dude! He's sorry! Wait!
Red PUNCHES Saul in the face! Saul SCREAMS and drops to
the ground.
SAUL (CONT'D)
WHY!?!?!
Dale snatches the phone and scurries into the bathroom,
slamming the door behind him.
Dale and Saul run like hell. Saul spots a dumpster.
SAUL
In here!
Saul jumps into the dumpster.
DALE
No. I've got to get to a phone!
SAUL
We should hide!
DALE
But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name,
then they'll go to my apartment and find
out about Angie!
SAUL
I think we should stay!
DALE
Why?!
SAUL
Because I'm in the dumpster already!
Shit! Fine!
Saul hops out of the dumpster and follows Dale.
Inside an Escalade with tinted
windows sit two
frightening looking Asian men.
They have earphones on and
an eavesdropping tool aimed at
Ted's house. They hear
every word. One of them writes
down info in Korean.
57
CAROL (O.S.)
(through one of the Asian
mens ear piece)
I'll be back in an hour with everything
there is on Dale Denton. He'll be dead by
the time we make our pick-up tomorrow.
Dale and Saul are still running and are unbelievably
exhausted.
SAUL
(gasping and
wheezing)
But my parents live
in Canada. You don't
think they're going
to go to Canada, do
you? How would they
get a Canadian phone
book even?
DALE
(gasping and wheezing)
All I know is Angie's new number is on my
fridge and they could see that, so I have
to get to her.
SAUL
My Grandma lives here. They wouldn't go
after her, would they? She's got a
different last name. Belogus.
Dale hails a cab.
Dale and Saul get out of the cab in a pleasant
neighborhood. Saul begrudgingly pays the driver. They
walk towards Angie's house.
DALE
Dude, stay here. I'll be back in a
minute.
SAUL
Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I
want to go with you!
DALE
Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally
be five minutes. Please.
SAUL
Fine. But hurry.
Dale runs up to the front door and frantically knocks.
Angie answers the door.
Saul sees a car nearing. He sees Budlofsky and Matheson
are in it.
SAUL
No fucking way.
He runs like hell towards Angie's.
Budlofsky and Matheson are walking towards the front door
when they hear the gunshot and dive behind some bushes.
BUDLOFSKY
Fuck! What the hell?
MATHESON
Get out your fucking gun!
BUDLOFSKY
What the fuck is going on?
BANG! Blasts through the front door and almost hits them!
Budlofsky and Matheson are now at the front door. They've
each got a gun drawn and are preparing to burst in.
Budlofsky is loading his bullet cartridge.
64
MATHESON
Ready?
BUDLOFSKY
No. One sec.
Budlofsky puts in the last few bullets.
MATHESON
Hurry the fuck up.
BUDLOFSKY
Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't
helping.
Budlofsky cocks his gun and nods at Matheson.
Dale and Saul are sitting in the branches of a tree. Fast
food wrappers lie scattered. Saul is rolling a joint.
SAUL
Victory joint complete. Here ya go.
Saul passes it to Dale, who lights it. Dale takes another
puff and starts to seriously relax. A smile creeps across
his face as he passes the joint to Saul.
DALE
"Tell us what you know!" How fuckin'
balls was that?
Saul takes a puff.
SAUL
Like, really balls.
DALE
And I think I fought pretty well, don't
you? You know, for my first time. We were
like Tango and Cash, man.
SAUL
Or Scarface!
DALE
BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's
hinges!
Saul passes the joint to Dale.
SAUL
And you probably saved Angie, which is
fucking pimp.
69
DALE
I probably couldn't have done it without
you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp.
SAUL
We're in this together, right? So, ya
know.
Saul passes the joint to Dale.
DALE
Thanks, man.
(beat)
You know, my last dealer was a total
dick. You're by far the coolest dealer
I've ever had.
SAUL
(sincerely)
Wow. Thanks, man. I seriously appreciate
that.
DALE
Yeah...like, the time before last time, I
totally had weed. I just kind of wanted
to chill with you.
SAUL
(over-joyed)
Really? That's awesome, man. That means a
lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes
come in to buy and pretend to be all
buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm
always, like, "you don't like me, you
like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" You
know? And just so you know, I totally
could have lit that cross-joint on my
own. I'd just have to use candles, but,
like, I've never smoked one of those with
anyone before.
Dale passes Saul the joint.
DALE
So, do you think we should leave town? We
could just get on a bus and go, right?
SAUL
We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't
think that could even pay for one ticket.
Saul rubs the roach out in the dirt.
70
DALE
What about your sack?
Saul rubs his balls again.
SAUL
Oh man. It's still fucking killing me.
DALE
(laughing)
No dude, your sack of weed. Can't we sell
some?
SAUL
Of course. That's my bread and butter. We
just have to go to a highschool. It's the
easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is
like, a block a way.
DALE
No way, man. I'm not going to sell to
kids.
SAUL
Why? They're gonna get it from somewhere.
I mean, we got it from guys like us.
DALE
Well, then not kids at that school.
SAUL
Well, there's a bunch of private ones
nearby, but they're into way crazier shit
than weed-
DALE
I can't do it, man. I'm not going to a
high school is there anywhere else we
could go?
SAUL
(thinks, then-)
We could go to Crackhead Park.
DALE
What's that?
SAUL
It's a park. Really close, actually. Full
of crackheads. They smoke weed too,
though.
71
There are several tarp-houses set up, garbage all over,
and crazy/dangerous homeless people milling about the
park. A deranged looking homeless man walks over to
another one and starts pissing on his leg. They begin
fist fighting. Suddenly, a half eaten hamburger hits Dale
in the face and a bag lady comes up to Saul and starts
poking him.
SAUL
Hey, stop it. Stop it. You wanna buy some
weed, or, like, what?
The bag lady runs off.
SAUL (CONT'D)
See, that's the problem around here.
Target demographic has a real, uh, fickle
attention span. You gotta wow `em.
(beat)
Hey! Who wants some weed!?!
DALE
Fuck this place.
CUT TO:
At the same high school Angie goes to, Dale and Saul walk
up to four thirteen year old students. (DESMOND, WALT,
ACK and BLAKE)
SAUL
Yo. `sup. You guys want some chronic?
Dale and the four kids all laugh hysterically as Saul
marches around pretending to be Godzilla, blasting weed
smoke out of his nose and mouth as though it was fire.
Saul passes Ack the joint. He takes a puff and starts
coughing.
DALE
(very stoned)
Man, this is great.
72
ACK
Cough
Cough
What's it called again?
WALT
Pineapple express. They said it, like,
eight times, you fucking `tard.
ACK
Oh, so sorry if I-
BLAKE
Come on, man. Puff, puff, pass.
SAUL
You know, I went here for a year. Kicked
me out for having a swiss army knife.
Everyone has a swiss army knife!
DALE
I got like, thirty for my Bar Mitzvah.
DESMOND
My Bar Mitzvah sucked.
ACK
I touched Jessica Lubell's tit at your
Bar Mitzvah.
DALE
You touched a tit when you were twelve?
WALT
Lubell? Are you joking? Those are the
finest tats in the grade!
ACK
Fuck that, dude. Angie in 12th grade has,
like, the sweetest tits ever.
DALE
Hey!
WALT
What? You know her?
DALE
Yeah. She's my girlfriend.
DESMOND
Whoa. You're that dude. You lucky fucker.
73
DALE
(proud)
Yeah. She's pretty sweet.
SAUL
And we're all high, that's hilarious.
Blake passes the joint to Dale.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Alright gentlemen, it's time for me to
teach you some business. Brass tacs -
this is the best weed you've ever smoked,
agreed?
The kids all nod in agreement.
SAUL (CONT'D)
So I'm gonna make this simple. How much
did you get between you?
BLAKE
A hundred and seventy eight.
Saul pulls out his impressive bag of weed. The kids GASP.
SAUL
Alright. You gimme all your money, you
can each take two handfuls of weed. That
treat ya right?
The kids cheer as Desmond takes two BIG handfuls.
DESMOND
That's fucking awesome!
SAUL
I know. Keep it on the down low.
They pay Dale and take their weed. Happy as hell, they
run off, stuffing HANDFULS OF WEED into their pockets.
ACK
(to Walt)
Jason'll never believe this...until I
show him all this weed!
Dale holds the un-lit joint as Saul takes the pot and the
money.
SAUL
And we, my good man, are officially scott
fuckin' free.
74
DALE
There are still people trying to kill us.
SAUL
But at least now we can afford to run.
I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks.
Let's have us a little mardi-gras
fiesta.
Saul laughs as he puts on his backpack and walks around
the corner. Dale re-lights the remaining roach and
casually smokes. He blows some smoke rings, coughs a bit,
stretches; for a few moments, looking completely relaxed,
but then-
A COP CAR screeches to a halt right in front of Dale! A
female POLICE LIAISON OFFICER (who is not Carol) gets out
of the car. Dale freezes in horror.
POLICE LIAISON
Don't move!
She walks towards Dale. He seems prepared to run, but she
places her hand on a can of pepper spray.
POLICE LIAISON (CONT'D)
Don't move! This stuff hurts. What's in
your hand?
DALE.
I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid
of it right away, I was just smoking
this. I...I thought it was
decriminalized. Or something. For medical
purposes. I have epilepsy.
POLICE LIAISON
Selling pot to my students isn't
"decriminalized." I'm the liaison officer
for this school and I just caught four
students showing off handfuls of
marijuana to their friends. They told me
they got it back here. Put your hands up.
She cuffs Dale's hands behind him!
DALE
Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I
have is this little joint.
Police Liaison takes the large joint out of Dale's hand.
75
POLICE LIAISON
You call this little?
She throws it on the ground and smears it around with her
foot.
DALE
I don't even have any money! How did I
sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I
was just smoking it. I swear. Please.
She pats him down, finding only his wallet. The Police
Liaison sees he only has nine dollars. She pulls out his
DRIVER'S LICENSE.
POLICE LIAISON
It's possible you're telling the truth.
I'm going to run a check and if it turns
out you don't have any priors and all
you've got is this small amount of
marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine.
Take a seat.
She walks towards her car as Dale sits on the ground.
ANGLE ON: Saul
Saul merrily turns into the alley holding TWO RED
SLURPEES, when he jumps back in terror! He sees the cop
car up the alley. He ducks back behind the corner.
SAUL
They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh
fuck...
ANGLE ON: Dale and the Police Liaison
She looks at her car computer. The screen reads:
DALE DENTON: OUTSTANDING WARRANT - DOUBLE HIT AND RUN.
She looks back at Dale and types into her computer.
The Police Liaison stuffs Dale in the back of her squad
car.
DALE
What is this for? What did that thing
tell you? What did I do?
POLICE LIAISON
Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double,
actually. You hit two parked cars two
nights ago.
A look of crippling horror comes across Dale's face as
she throws him in the back seat and slams his door shut.
ANGLE ON: Saul
He peaks down the alley and sees Dale in the back of the
car and the FEMALE Police Liaison getting in the front.
SAUL
The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.
The car slowly makes a three point turn.
Saul peeks out and sees the approaching cop car. He looks
at the two red slurpees and thinks, then suddenly jumps
out and THROWS himself onto the hood of the cop car!
The Police Liaison and Dale see a body SLAM against the
car and RED LIQUID SPLATTER everywhere, covering the
windshield. They SCREAM.
WHAM! In the impact, we clearly see Saul's BALLS getting
ROCKED on the car! The Police Liaison slams on the
brakes, causing Dale to SMASH into the metal cage.
POLICE LIAISON
Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!
She puts the car in park. As the Police Liaison gets out
of her car, Saul can be seen crawling around the back of
the vehicle, clutching his testicles. The frightened
Police Liaison looks at the windshield.
She notices the two slurpee cups on the ground and
quickly turns around. She sees Saul jumping into the
drivers seat.
Saul sees a SHOTGUN beside the passenger seat. The Police
Liaison reaches for her GUN!
DALE
NO! What are you doing!?!
78
SAUL
Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and
Cash!
POLICE LIAISON
Freeze mister! Don't even...
Saul slams the car into reverse! He speeds backwards up
the alley as the Police Liaison runs after them - GUN
DRAWN!
DALE
No! She was going to help us!
SAUL
(in pain)
Oh...my balls...I seriously think I
popped one...
Suddenly, Carol (the cop from Ted's house) whips her COP
CAR into the alley! WHAM!!! It smashes into the rear of
their car! Dale turns around and establishes eye contact
with the stunned Carol.
DALE
(horrified)
IT'S HER! The lady cop!
Saul slams down the gas! Through the slurpee covered
window Saul sees the Police Liaison rushing towards them.
SAUL
(motion at the Police
Liaison)
Then who's that?
The Police Liaison raises her gun.
SAUL (CONT'D)
DALE
NOOOO!!!
AAAAH!!!
BLAM! She fires and the bullet punches through the
windshield! The Police Liaison dives to the side as they
zoom past her! They burst out of the alley. A moment
later, Carol follows, in hot pursuit.
I/E. DALE AN SAUL'S STOLEN COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
The car weaves through traffic.
SAUL
The slurpee! I can't see!
79
DALE
Turn on the wipers!
Saul mindlessly starts grasping at switches in the car.
He finally turns on the wipers, which wipe away the
slurpee and reveal that the window is so badly cracked he
still can't see through it. Carol's car emerges right
behind them.
SAUL
Dude, I seriously can't see!
DALE
Kick out the window! Isn't that what they
do?
SAUL
I don't know. Okay.
Saul, with great effort, keeps one foot on the pedals
and, with all his might, kicks his other leg through the
front window. His leg PUNCHES straight through the glass,
but he can't pull it back in!
SAUL (CONT'D)
Oh fuck! Shit!
DALE
Get it out of there!
Suddenly, their car gets jerked to the side.
SAUL
Ah! Ah! My leg!
Carol is ramming them from behind.
DALE
(hysterical)
She's following us! She's gaining on us!
SAUL
Her car's better!
Saul yanks at his leg and manages to wriggle it out of
the hole. He begins to accelerate and realizes he can see
where he's going through the hole.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole!
Saul bumps over the curb and cuts through a LARGE PARK.
Carol is right behind them.
80
DALE
Do something!
Saul thinks hard, then buckles his seat belt.
SAUL
Hold on. I've got an idea.
Dale does what little he can to brace himself. Saul SLAMS
on the breaks. Carol sees Saul screeching to a halt and
slams on her breaks. She grunts and whips out her GUN.
Both cars come to a full stop beside one another.
She opens fire - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! - Bullets
rip through the stolen cruiser. Shattered glass flies
everywhere. Dale and Saul desperately duck for cover.
Saul hits the gas and the bullet riddled car takes off.
Carol follows.
DALE
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?
Saul pops back up and begins steering again.
SAUL
Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd
keep going.
The car bumps back on to a main road. Carol follows,
sirens blaring.
DALE
Turn on the sirens!
Saul's hand flails around, grasping everything. He feels
the SHOTGUN and accidentally pulls the trigger-
BOOM! The blast blows through the roof of the car and
hits an overhead TRAFFIC LIGHT - shredding it to pieces!
SAUL
DALE
JESUS!!!
SHIT!
Carol flies into the intersection on a collision course
with Saul and Dale.
CRUNCH! A car smashes into the side of the Carol's
cruiser.
As Dale and Saul speed off, Carol emerges from the
smoking wreckage, a look of hate in her eyes.
81
The stolen cruiser screeches to a halt and Saul hops out.
SAUL
Run!
He starts running up the block at top speed.
Dale, still handcuffed in the back of the cruiser, starts
thrashing and screaming.
DALE
Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!
Dale continues to scream as Saul obliviously bolts to the
end of the block and just keeps going.
DALE (CONT'D)
You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!!
Dale sits in the car, helpless. He has a look of utter
disbelief on his face. After a moment of silence he
starts wildly kicking the door window. He soon gives up.
Just then, Dale notices Saul, over a block away, running
back towards the stolen car. Saul soon arrives,
completely out of breath, and opens the door.
SAUL
So... huff ... huff ...fuckin'
sorry... huff ...forgot...
Dale flops out of the car and onto the grass. Saul tries
to help him to his feet, but Dale pulls away.
DALE
Don't touch me, you asshole!
Dale wiggles to his feet runs for it. Saul follows.
Dale stretches his arms. The handcuffs are still on his
hands, but no longer attached.
DALE
(relieved)
Okay, I'm going to go call Angie. Be
right back.
SAUL
A thank you would be nice!
Dale is on the phone.
DALE
Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room,
please?
INTERCUT WITH:
83
As Dale walks out of his phone booth, we see that Saul is
on the phone in the next booth and is also smoking from a
pipe.
SAUL
Alrghit, I'll see you soon. And I'm sorry
again about the clocks.
(beat)
Ha! What a douche bag.
(beat)
Yeah, love you too.
Saul hangs up and exits the phone booth.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta
go see my grandma, okay? She was worried
`cause I didn't show up to help with the
locks. But before that I've got to smoke
another bowl.
DALE
Are you joking? You're actually gonna
smoke marijuana?
SAUL
Why not?
DALE
How can you smoke marijuana after what we
just went through? That clearly happened
because we were smoking marijuana.
SAUL
No. It happened because those fucking
kids didn't keep that shit on the down
low. Which is weird, `cause they really
seemed like cool kids.
85
DALE
If you haven't noticed, we're not very
functional when we're stoned, Saul.
SAUL
When I saved you with those Slurpees I
was stoned. What do you gotta say to
that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the
creative capacity to come up with such a
great plan! The Beatles were high!
DALE
You didn't save me! She was going to
protect us, and now we're wanted for all
sorts of crazy shit!
Saul lights his bowl.
DALE (CONT'D)
Fine. Smoke marijuana. But you know how
"Scarface" ends. Face down, dead, in your
own fuckin' water fountain.
SAUL
For one thing, I'm done dealing pot.
Mostly, because I don't know where I
would get it now, but still. And "b",
fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're
exactly the same, and this whole thing's
your fucking fault. You're the one who
dropped the roach!
DALE
It's not my fault!
Dale points at Saul's bowl.
DALE (CONT'D)
It's marijuana's fault!
SAUL
Stop calling it marijuana!
DALE
Grow up, you fucking two year old.
SAUL
See! This is why you're a douche bag,
Denton. Because you think you're better
than others, but you're just a dumb
pothead burnout, same as me.
86
DALE
Maybe I am a pothead burnout, but at
least I'm not the dumbest most annoying
guy in the world. The only reason I ever
bought weed from you was because you're
shit is so good, not because you're cool.
SAUL
But you said you bought when you already
had a few times, just to hang out?
DALE
Bullshit! I just like...liked having lots
of different kinds of weed at once.
Saul takes out his wad of cash and throws half of it at
Dale.
SAUL
Here. Buy yourself a good last meal.
He throws fifty more cents at the shocked Dale.
SAUL (CONT'D)
Super size it, bitch.
Saul walks off.
DALE
Saul! I'm sorry, man! I didn't mean all
that! Saul!
A sad Dale starts picking up the money.
Dale hustles towards the entrance of the building when he
sees several police cars parked outside, their lights
flashing.
He sees a bunch of old people gathered on the front lawn.
Doing his best to avoid the cops, he joins the cluster of
elderly.
OLD WOMAN
Oh, god this is terrible. Poor Faye.
Poor, poor Faye.
DALE
Hey, uh, what's going on here?
OLD MAN
It just happened.
DALE
What did?
OLD WOMAN
Faye Belogus' grandson was kidnapped from
right inside the building. We all saw it.
They fought in the majong room and hurt
the new nurse, Stefan.
Dale is terrified.
DALE
Uh...thanks.
OLD MAN
If I was there, I would've kicked an ass.
90
Dale looks, circle of people comforting a crying old
woman, clearly Faye Belogus. He walks over.
DALE
Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's
going to be fine.
Dale walks off, determined.
Dale and Red are in Red's car, a FORD FIESTA, driving
through the countryside. Dale stops the car 100 yards
from the barn.
94
RED
This is awesome! We're so gonna show
those motherfuckers. Think they can kill
me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll.
Red gets out and walks to the drivers side. Dale gets
out, gun in hand. Red gets in the drivers seat.
DALE
What are you doing?
RED
So, this is the backside of the farm. If
you stay low in the grass you should be
fine. If someone is shooting at you with
an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes
you harder to hit.
DALE
You're not coming to help?
RED
Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I
was in shock before, but the air on the
drive cleared my mind, I should get to
the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs,
right? I got shot in the best spot
possible. I could have a long and
fruitful life ahead of me. Full of
possibilities. Go get `em, slugger.
DALE
But how do I get out of here if I rescue
Saul?
RED
I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that
hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or
just take it or whatever. Good luck,
amigo!
Red drives off. Dale takes a deep breath, clenches his
gun, and starts cautiously moving towards the barn. He
checks to make sure his safety is off and he's ready to
fight. Dale sneaks up on the building and pears in
between two boards. He sees Budlofsky supervising as the
thugs load the van.
95
Five Asian men lay on their stomachs in the tree line
dressed in black and armed with machine guns. One of them
stares through a pair of night-vision binoculars while
utilizing a listening device. We see his view of Ted and
hear what he hears.
TED
Well, we'll torture these two bastards
and find out everything they know. What
about the shipment? Ready to move out?
BUDLOFSKY
We'll be good to in 10 minutes or so.
The Asian leader nods and does some hand signals to his
men. The acknowledge they understand. He holds up a
flashlight and flashes three times. From the opposing
side of the barn two other flashlights blink back. They
all get up and start to slowly move towards the barn.
99
Thirty feet from the barn there is an air vent sticking
out of the ground. The top flies off and Saul emerges. He
flops onto the ground, then immediately scampers to his
and pulls out his gun. Saul looks to the open road to
freedom, then back at the barn.
SAUL
Fuck...
106
Saul inches towards the barn, hearing a melee of gunfire
and screams as he nears it. He cautiously peers in and
watches as Carol shoots an assassin in the chest then
spins around and shoots at another assassin who
desperately runs with a METAL BRIEFCASE handcuffed to his
wrist. Carol hits him several times; he lurches over and
falls through the trap door. She smiles and drops her
empty gun.
Saul watches Carol as she heads towards the trap door. He
takes a deep breath and CHARGES into the barn, unleashing
a barrage of bullets at her! BLAM BLAM BLAM! CLICK.
107
CLICK. CLICK. None of the bullets hit her. She turns and
sees Saul, who drops his empty gun.
SAUL
Fuck tha po-lice.
They both SCREAM in rage and CHARGE, fists flying as they
collide. Carol whips Saul around by his collar and hurls
him to the ground. She runs up and kicks him in the gut,
time and time again.
CAROL
I'm a fucking cop, you moron.
SAUL
AAAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHH!!!
Saul leaps to his feet and PUNCHES Carol in the face. He
PUNCHES her again. She reaches for her mace, so Saul
kicks her in the groin and grabs it for himself, then
sprays her in the face.
SLAM! He punches her in the face.
