    Dexter glances up to see Debra, looking a little shaky, 
    making her way toward him.

                        I talked to the guests in Room 105.  
                        They didn t see anyone go in or out.

                        mixing margaritas or -- oh my God.

    Over LaGuerta sshoulder, Debra sees her blood-soaked 
    brother flounder out of the hotel.  She rushes to him.  
    Dexter sucks in the fresh air like a Hoover upright.

                                        DEBRA

                      All I need is a little proof of his 
                        inner monster.  Harry would have 
                        insisted on that.

    As Dexter approaches Paul s room, hehearsINFANT CRIES from 
    one of the units.Dexterignores the  DO NOT DISTURB  sign 
    on the door, makes sure no one is watching, then picks the 
    lock.


    The door to Paul s room bursts open and Dexter stumbles out, 
    freaked, panting, soaked in sweat.  He fights for breath, 
    looking around desperately.  What the hell is happening?


    Dark.  Forboding.  The moon hides in the black sky.  Dexter 
    trudges along his exterior balcony, rattled from his latest 
    memory.  He freezes at the sight of a SHADOWED FIGURE 
    outside his door.  The person steps into the light.  It s 
    Rudy waiting with a brown paper bag in hand.

                                        RUDY
                        Hey.

                                        DEXTER
                        Hey.

                                        RUDY
                        Deb s pissed at me.  I need advice. 

                                        DEXTER
                      So you came here?

                                        RUDY
                      You know her better than anyone.  
                        C mon, I got two porterhouses and a 
                        sixerof microbrew.

    Rudy holds up the bag.  Off Dexter, without an excuse...


    Two porterhouse steaks sizzle in a pan.  Rudy, holding a 
    beer, rummages through drawers, searching through various 
    sharp utensils.  Dexter painfully watches.

                                        RUDY
                        Well... one minute we re talking about 
                      her day, y knowthat whole bloodbath 
                        thing.

                        Right, right.

    Rudy slams closed one drawer and opens another to search.

                                        RUDY
                      The next, she wants to jump my bones.  
                        I mean, Deb s hot and all but sprinkle 
                      in some conversation once in awhile,

                        I don t know.  She s my sister.

                      Can I help you find something?      DEXTER 110        "Seeing Red"     Final Draft -- 9/20/06       32.

                      You wouldn t happen to have a good 
                        meat knife? 

    Dexter opens a drawer, pulls out a MEAT KNIFE, and hands it 
    to Rudy.  As he talks, Rudy casually waves the knife for 
    emphasis.

                                        RUDY 
                        Anyway, the other part of the argument 
                      was about you.

                                        DEXTER
                      Me?

                                        RUDY
                        Yeah, it was already tense, but when I 
                        brought your name up, she lost it.

    Dexter considers this for a moment.

                                        DEXTER
                      Deb doesn t like to feel left out.  
                        It s kindaher issue.

                                        RUDY
                      So what do I do?

                                        DEXTER 
                        Tell her it was all your fault.

                                        RUDY
                        Seriously?

                                        DEXTER
                      You will eventually.  Deb has a way of 
                        wearing you down.  So just start from 
                        that place.  It saves time.

    Rudy s cell phone RINGS.  He looks at the caller ID.

                                        RUDY
                        Sorry, gotta take this.

    Rudy puts down the knife and steps outside to take the call.


                                        RUDY

    Several hours and beers later, Dexter and Rudy say goodbye.

                                        RUDY
                        Thanks for the hospitality.

                                        DEXTER
                        Thanks for the steaks.

    Rudy sticks out his hand.  As Dexter awkwardly shakes --

                                        RUDY
                        Hey, I never even got a chance to ask.  
                        Debra mentioned that you had a little 
                        incident at the crime scene.

                                        DEXTER
                      Did she?

                                        RUDY
                        Most of my prosthetics clients are 
                        pretty traumatized by the time they 
                      get to me.  Anyway, I m a good 
                        listener.  If you ever need to talk.

    Feeling oddly comfortable, Dexter speaks before he thinks.

                                        DEXTER 
                        Thanks, but unless you know an expert 
                      in repressed memories...

    Rudy stares at him.      DEXTER 110        "Seeing Red"     Final Draft -- 9/20/06       38.

                      You know something about it?

                                (beat)
                        When I was in high school I started

                      No idea.  Till one day I stopped by a 
                        mail box -- and it all came crashing 
                        back.  My Mom... getting out to mail a 
                        letter... me in the car.  I watched 
                      her die.

                      How old were you?

                                        RUDY
                        Four.  But I didn t remember it till I 
                        mailed a letter.  Walked right into 
                      the belly of the beastwithout

                        They re still a little vague.

                        Right.  Well, you gotta face  em 
                        eventually.  Maybe next time.

    Dexter appreciates the advice -- and Rudy not prying.

                        When you talk to Deb, go with white

    Rudy walks away.  After a beat, Dexter turns back into --


    -- still a little unsettled.  He automatically starts 
    clearing beer bottles.

                        Rudy misunderstands my problem.  I 
                        want the boy in blood to go away, not 
                        come crashing back.  Fortunately, I

    Dexter grabs Rudy s CELL PHONE and runs outside --


    -- just in time to hear a CAR ENGINE drive away.  Rudy s 
    gone.  Oh well.  As Dexter heads back inside --


    Masuka looks through a microscope when Batista enters.

    Dexter runs across the grass, with Paul hoisted over his

                        own.  They were wrong.


    In a SERIES OF CUTS, Dexter fishes Paul s car keys from his 
    pocket, pops Paul s trunk, and dumps Paul inside.  Climbing 
    into the car, he puts the gear in neutral and lets it roll 
    into the street.  Next, Dexter starts the engine and 
    screeches around the corner.


    Dexter runs back the opposite way across the yard.
