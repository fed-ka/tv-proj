          Everything is CONSUMED BY BLOOD-ORANGE NUCLEAR FIRE.  

          It's Armageddon, just as Johnny as seen before...

          Only this is a new angle on a familiar old terror.  The
          FIRE comes at him in a WAVE, RUSHING OVER HIM, and taking
          Alex with it.  Johnny raises his arms to shield from the
            ALL-CONSUMING FIRE, only to FLASH....


  77BACK TO JOHNNY

          He gets his bearings.  Alex raises a cup of beer.

                                        ALEX
                          A toast.  To Mr. Smith!  For giving
                        each of us the key to the brightest
                        future we could ever imagine! 

          As the group APPLAUDS and CHEERS, Johnny forces a smile.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          Johnny takes apart the morning paper.  Bruce is here.

                          Stillson, in a tuxedo.  Then,
                        nuclear hellfire.

                        And flashbulbs.

                        This is why I'll never buy a ticket
                        to the theater of your mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        These advanced polymers Alex is
                        working on, they seem harmless. 
                        Some of them could be used as
                        artificial skin grafts.  If
                          anything, they're gonna save lives.

                        But when you touch him...
                                (makes explosion sound)
                        KABOOM!

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something strange about that,
                        too.  Before D.C. explodes, Alex
                        gets consumed by fire. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe he's not the cause of the
                        blast.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's the flashpoint.

                                        BRUCE
                        My money's on the original Dark
                        Prince. 

          Bruce shows Johnny something he's found in the paper: A
          PHOTO of Greg Stillson waving through a group of reporters. 
          Off Johnny as he studies the photo...



            Stillson, on his cell phone, walks to a waiting LIMO.  He
          is pissed about something.

                                        STILLSON
                        You spoke with him?  And?

                                                                                INTERCUT:



          A STABLE WORKER walks a HORSE past an incongruous black
          SUV, where DARK-SUITED MAN and SIDEKICK stand watch. 
          Malcolm Janus is on his cell phone.

                                        JANUS
                        I reminded the Reverend that there
                        is a higher power than God as it
                        relates to his newfound celebrity.

                                        STILLSON
                        The main thing is he's going to
                        keep an open pipeline to the Faith
                          Heritage cash register.  Where
                        are you?

                                        JANUS
                        Setting up the next leg of the
                        Greg Stillson march to the White
                        House.

                                        STILLSON
                        Nice.  I'm at Portland Chemical. 
                        They've been talking up one of
                        their researchers.  Prodigy I'm
                        told.

                                (caught off guard)
                        You know him?

                                        JANUS
                        I know his work.

                                        STILLSON
                        The CEO says young Alex is onto
                          something big.  They could announce
                          something within the month.  That
                        means the stock price could
                        skyrocket.  There's just one
                          problem.

                                        JANUS
                        What's that?

                                        STILLSON
                          Conners' old science teacher's
                        been visiting the lab.  Johnny
                        Smith.

          Janus darkens.

                                        STILLSON
                        Did you hear me?

                                        JANUS
                        Let me get into it.

          Janus closes his cell phone, considers his next move...



          Stillson gets in his limo.  Janus is here.

                                        STILLSON
                        I want Smith kept away from here.

                                        JANUS
                        My sources tell me he was thrown
                        out yesterday.

                                        STILLSON
                        If Smith derails that kid's work,
                        he derails the money train. 

                                        JANUS
                        I've got it under control.

                                        STILLSON
                        Do you?  That freak is up to
                        something.  What if Smith's meeting
                        this kid outside the lab?  Follow
                        Conners and find out.

                                        JANUS
                                (unfazed)
                        It's under control.



          Johnny and Bruce pull up alongside a wall in Bruce's
          Murano.  They get out and move alongside the building.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure this is a good idea? 
                        They're just gonna toss you again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I'm right, my vision came true
                        and he's already met Stillson.

                                        BRUCE
                        So now what?

          Johnny motions to Alex's motorcycle.  Parked near the
          door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm gonna wait for Alex.  Find a
                        way to convince him that what
                        he's doing is going to be very
                        bad for everyone.

                                        BRUCE
                        How you plan to do that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  Maybe you're right,
                        maybe I just need to lay it all
                        out.

          Johnny stops at the motorcycle, touches it. 


    4949WHOOOSH! 

          Alex is there.  Leaving work.

          Vision Johnny observes.  Alex walks past him...

          And Alex DOES NOT see the Dark-suited Man near the side
          of the building.  Just... watching.  Alex gets on his
          bike and leaves.  Dark-suited Man goes to a car, gets in. 
          He and his accomplice (Sidekick) follow.

          When Alex pulls out, the sedan cuts him off.  Alex
          innocently wonders who these guys are.  But when they get
          out, they move toward him, menacingly...


  5050BACK ON JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          Johnny flashes out of the vision.

                                        BRUCE
                        What'd you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're coming for Alex.



          Alex walks to his motorcycle.










                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT THREE - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   41.

    51CONTINUED:51

          We notice a BLACK SEDAN in the corner of the parking lot. 
          Sitting there.  Dark-suited Man watches. 

          Alex rides off.  He does not notice the CAR follow him.



          Alex stops, where Bruce's Murano is near the exit.  Bruce
          drives, Johnny rides shotgun. 

          Johnny rolls down the window, calls to Alex, who still
          has his helmet on.

                                        ALEX
                        Mr. Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're being followed.  Don't
                        look back!  Just keep going.

                                        ALEX
                        Where?

                                        JOHNNY
                        'Field trip.'  Twelfth grade.

          Alex gives a slight nod, takes off.  Johnny sits back in
          the passenger seat, hiding from the car behind them.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hold on!

          When the BLACK SEDAN goes to follow, Bruce pulls into the
          middle of the street, cutting it off -- as if he were
          trying to make a wide right.  The Men HONK at Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                                (plays innocent)
                        Sorry!  My fault!  Just learned
                        to drive a stick!

          The diversion is enough to let Alex get away to...



          Johnny and Bruce pull up and get out in front of the
          striking structure.  A sign reads: "Maine Museum of Science
          & Nature."  There's no one around.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe he misunderstood you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or maybe he just didn't trust me.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT THREE - 4/20/05 - GREEN    42.

            Suddenly, Alex steps out from the darkness. 

                                        ALEX
                                (to Johnny)
                        It happened.  I had the
                          breakthrough, the beakers fell. 
                        Then Peck came in with that
                          Stillson guy.  Just like you said.

                                        BRUCE
                        Funny how that works, ain't it?

                                        ALEX
                        I'm a man of science, but I can't
                        find a rational explanation for
                        it.

                                        BRUCE
                        There's no explanation.  It's...
                        cosmic. 

                                        ALEX
                        You wanna tell me what my local
                          Congressman's got to do with it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Greg Stillson can't be allowed to
                        exploit your work. 

                                        ALEX
                        It's going to be converted, isn't
                        it?  Used in some kind of weapon. 
                          A W.M.D.

                                        BRUCE
                        Guess there's a reason you're the
                        star pupil.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (you knew)
                        You knew?

          Alex pulls a POLYMER SAMPLE from his pocket (the one he
          tossed at Johnny earlier).

                                        ALEX
                        It's always been in the back of
                        my mind.  I knew my research could
                        exploited.  But there's more,
                        isn't there?

          Johnny hesitates, but his eyes give him away.

                                        ALEX
                        When you touch me, what do you
                        see?

          Johnny hesitates...

                        I see fire.  I see the end of the
                        world.

          Alex tries to take it all in, but how?

                                        ALEX
                        What do you want me to do?

                                        BRUCE
                        That'a boy.

                                (to Alex)
                        It's too dangerous.

                                        ALEX
                                (re: the polymer)
                          I created this.  My mind, my hands
                        brought it to life.  Somebody's
                        gotta be the vanguard against
                        these bastards, right?  Might as
                        well be us, Teach.

          The mentor finds surprising inspiration from his student. 
          Johnny takes the sample from Alex, and-- WHOOOSH!



          Bruce sleeps near the wooden buildings on the side. 
          There's a fire in embers.  Johnny, looking tired, stares
          out past the building, Alex joins him.

                                        ALEX
                        I've been thinking about it and 
                        it seems to me, we need to trash
                        the hard drive and burn the
                          samples.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  But I should go.

                                        ALEX
                        You?  After the other day, you
                        won't get anywhere near that lab.

          Johnny knows he's right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't let you destroy your life's
                        work.

                                        ALEX
                        First of all, I'm only 27.  Second,
                        you aren't my teacher anymore. 
                        You aren't 'letting' me do
                          anything.  We have to stop this.

          Johnny understands his former student's determination.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (thinking it through)
                        Go back to the lab.  Keep doing
                        what you're doing.  Tell them
                        it's just not working.  That'll
                        buy me some time.

          Where we saw Janus setting up a Stillson event earlier. 
          A black limo has just pulled up near a sign reading:
          "UNITED MAINE CHARITIES, ANNUAL SHOWJUMPING EVENT."



          Stillson moves through the stable with Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        I'm heartened by the fact that we
                        could work out our differences.

                                        STILLSON
                        Never doubted your enthusiasm for
                        the cause.

                                        PURDY
                                (sees someone O.S.)
                        Ah, here he is now.

          Purdy leads Stillson to senior SENATOR HARLAN ELLIS.

                          Congressman Stillson, I'd like
                        you to meet--

                                        STILLSON
                        Senator Harlan Ellis.  Sir, it is
                        an honor.  You're a legend in
                        Maine politics.

                                        SEN. ELLIS
                        Christ almighty, am I that old?
                                (then)
                        Sorry, Reverend.

                                        PURDY
                        You're absolved, Senator.

          An ND PURDY AIDE comes up, whispers in his ear.  He peels
          off as we linger on Stillson and Ellis.

                                        STILLSON
                        I've been wanting to meet you for
                        years, sir.

                                        SEN. ELLIS
                        We share the same constituents,
                        son.  It's a good thing for us to
                        meet outside the beltway, get
                        back to our people -- touch the
                        natives as it were.

          As Ellis goes on, Stillson spots a CAPTIVATING YOUNG WOMAN
          dismount from a beautiful horse.  She wears riding
            (showjumping) attire. 

          Sen.  Ellis catches Stillson watching the YOUNG WOMAN.

                                        STILLSON
                        Now that's a constituent worth
                        wooing.

                                        SEN. ELLIS
                                (with a smile)
                        That's my daughter, Miranda.

                          Senator--

                                (laughs)
                        It's alright.  I was young once.
                                (to Young Woman)
                          Miranda!  Come here darling, I'd
                        like you to meet a friend of the
                        family.

                        This is Greg Stillson.  Greg is a
                          Congressman.  A young man with a
                        very bright future.

                        My pleasure.

          They shake hands.  Stillson is clearly taken by her.

                                        STILLSON
                        You look like you were born in
                        the saddle.

                        Are you a rider?

                                        STILLSON
                        No, but I'm a lethally quick study.

          Oh, yeah.  He likes her.



          Stillson is led to his limo door by the Driver.  Before
          he gets in, he tosses one last look toward the house.

          Miranda, headed inside, glances back.  A traded smile. 
          Greg gets in the limo, brimming with bravado, only to
          find...



          Bruce's Murano pulls up, Johnny gets out.  But as he
          approaches, he sees no one.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex?

          He sees Alex's tipped over motorcycle and helmet.  Then
          he spots Bruce.  Beaten bloody.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce!

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm sorry, John...

          Johnny finds Alex's HELMET, picks it up and--


  6565VISION - MOMENTS BEFORE

          Alex puts the HELMET on and gets on his bike.  Headed
          back to the lab.  He waves so long to Bruce -- who is
          suddenly accosted by Dark-suited Man!  Bruce puts up a
          fight.  It takes the two of them to knock him out.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   51.

          Alex runs toward his motorcycle.  He gets on.  Races away --
          but the second Man (Sidekick) is still in the car.

          He pulls it forward and cuts Alex off.

          Alex SPINS the bike around -- rooster-tailing sand and
          gravel behind him -- as he races the other way --

          But by then, the first Dark-Suited Man KNOCKS HIM OFF THE
          BIKE!  It slides to where Johnny just found it.

          Dark-suited Man reaches into his jacket... 

          Alex, on the ground, has nowhere to run.  Ready to die.

          But the Man only removes a MANILA ENVELOPE and tosses it
          at Alex.  Alex opens it.  Looks at something inside.

                                        ALEX
                        What do you want?

                        You. 

          Alex drops the envelope. 

          Filled with resignation, Alex goes with the two Men. 
          Willingly.  Gets in the car.  Drives away.  We FIND the
          manila envelope on the ground and FLASH BACK TO...


  6666JOHNNY IN THE PRESENT

          Bruce, conscious now, follows him, as they search the
          area.  Johnny finds the manila envelope half-buried in
          sand.  He flips it over to REVEAL...

          A PHOTO -- the picture of Alex and his FATHER (seen on
          the screensaver).

                        What is it?

          Johnny's heart sinks as he hands the envelope to Bruce. 

                                        BRUCE
                        They threatened his family.

                        Alex and I used to talk about

                        you.

          Alex's Father shakes Johnny's hand.  He and his wife go.

          Johnny's about to go, when he reaches into his pocket and
          places something on the coffin.

          TILT DOWN to the coffin and REVEAL...

          His lucky INDIAN-HEAD NICKEL.  And...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
