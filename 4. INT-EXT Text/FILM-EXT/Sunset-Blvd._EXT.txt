I had to be

fun on the cuff.
Gillis walks to the
street, which is dark
and empty.
He starts
down Sunset in an
Easterly direction.
A car passes.
He
tries to thumb a
ride, without success.
However, the second
car, a florist's
delivery wagon, stops.
Gillis jumps in and the
car drives off.

ARTIE GREEN'S APARTMENT
It is the most modest one-room affair, jam packed
with young people flowing over into the miniature
bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette.
The only
drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass
bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time.
Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only
a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests
party dress.
Abe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano
and sings Tokio Rose.
By the door, a group of young
men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso
White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar,
in the manner of a Bach choral.
Artie Green, a dark
haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties,
is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl.
The door behind some of the singers is pushed open,
jostling them out of their places.
In comes Gillis,
his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat
turned up.
Artie stops conducting, but the commer-
cial goes right on.
ARTIE
Well, what do you know ! Joe
Gillis !
GILLIS
Hi, Artie.
ARTIE
Where have you been keeping that
gorgeous face of yours?
GILLIS
In a deep freeze.
ARTIE
I almost reported you to the Bureau
of Missing Persons.
(To the company)
Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the
well-known screen writer, opium
smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
Gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and
Artie push their way into the room.
ARTIE
Give me your coat.
GILLIS
Let it ride for a while.
ARTIE
You're going to stay, aren't you?
GILLIS
That was the general idea.
ARTIE
Come on.
Artie starts peeling the coat off Gillis.
Its
texture takes his breath away.
ARTIE
What is this - mink?
He has taken the coat.
He looks at Gillis standing
there in tails.
ARTIE
Judas E. Priest, who did you
borrow that from? Adolphe
Menjou?
GILLIS
Close, but no cigar.
Gillis stands embarrassed While Artie rolls up the
Vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book-
shelf.
ARTIE
Say, you're not really smuggling
opium these days,
are you?
GILLIS
Where's the bar?
The two make their way toward the punch bowl.
It's
a little like running the gauntlet for Gillis.
There
are whistles and 'stares of astonishlnent at his tails.
When they reach the punch bowl, Artie picks up a
half-filled glass and fills it.
GILLIS
Good party.
ARTIE
The greatest.
They call me the Elsa
Maxwell of the assistant directors.
(To some guests who are
dipping their empty cups
into the punch bowl)
Hey, easy on the punch bowl.
Budget
only calls for three drinks per extra.
Fake the rest.
GILLIS
Listen, Artie, can I stick around
here for a while?
ARTIE
Sure, this'll go on all night.
GILLIS
I mean, could you put me up for
a couple of weeks?
ARTIE
It just so happens we have a
vacancy on the couch.
GILLIS
I'll take it.
ARTIE
I'll have the bell-hop take care
of your luggage.
He runs his finger across the decollete back of a
girl standing in a group next them.
ARTIE
Just register here.
The girl turns around.
She is Betty Schaefer.
BETTY
Hello, Mr.
Gillis.
ARTIE
You know each other?
Gillis looks at her a little puzzled.
BETTY
Let me help you.
Betty Schaeter,
Sheldrake's office.
GILLIS
Sure.
Bases Loaded.
ARTIE
Wait a minute.
This is the woman
I love.
What's going on? Who
was loaded?
GILLIS
Don't worry.
She's just a fan
for my literary output.
BETTY
(to Artie)
Hurt feelings department.
GILLIS
About that luggage.
Where's
the phone?
ARTIE
Over by the Rainbow Room.
Gillis squeezes his way through groups of people
to the telephone, which is next to an open door
leading to the bathroom.
The phone is busy.
A
girl sits listening to it, giggling wildly.
Another
girl beside her is laughing too.
They are apparently
sharing a conversation with some man on the other end
of the wire.
The telephone passes from hand to hand.
Gillis watches impatiently, then
GILLIS
When youlre through with that
thing, can I have it?
The girl just nods, going on with her chattering.
Gillis stands waiting, and Betty Schaefer comes up
with his glass.
BETTY
You forgot this.
GILLIS
Thanks.
BETTY
I've been hoping to run into you.
GILLIS
What for? To recover that knife
you stuck in my back?
BETTY
I felt a little guilty, so I got
out some of your old stories.
GILLIS
Why, you sweet kid.
BETTY
There's one called....Window...
something with a window.
GILLIS
Dark Windows.
How did you
like it?
BETTY
I didn't.
GILLIS
Thank you.
BETTY
Except for about six pages.
You've got a flashback there ...
There is too much racket for her.
BETTY
Is there someplace we can talk?
GILLIS
How about the Rainbow Room?
They squeeze their way towards the bathroom, past
Artie.
ARTIE
I said you could have my couch.
I didn't say you could have my
girl.
BETTY
This is shop talk.
She and Gillis go through the open door into
C-20
ARTIE'S BATHROOM
It's a little less noisy, although there are some
guests there, chatting and having fun.
Betty and
Gillis sit down on the edge of the tub.
GILLIS
Now if I got you correctly, there
was a short stretch of my fiction
you found worthy of notice.
BETTY
The flashback in the courtroom,
when she tells about being a
school teacher.
GILLIS
I had a teacher like that once.
BETTY
Maybe that's why it's good.
It's true, it's moving.
Now
why don't you use that character...
GILLIS
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
BETTY
Drop that attitude.
Here's some-
thing really worth while.
GILLIS
Want me to start right now?
Maybe there's some paper around.
BETTY
I'm serious.
I've got a few ideas.
GILLIS
I've got some ideas myself.
One
of them being this is New Year's
Eve.
How about living it up a
little?
BETTY
As for instance?
GILLIS
Well....
BETTY
We could make some paper boats
and have a regatta.
Or should
we just turn on the shower?
GILLIS
How about capturing the kitchen
and barricading the door?
BETTY
Are you hungry?
GILLIS
Hungry? After twelve years in
the Burmese jungle.
I am starving,
Lady Agatha -- starving for a
white shoulder --
BETTY
Phillip, you're mad!
One of the girls who was on the phone comes to
the door.
GIRL
You can have the phone now.
GILLIS
(Paying no attention)
Thirsting for the coolness of
your lips -
BETTY
No, Phillip, no.
We must be
strong.
You're still wearing
the uniform of the Coldstream
Guards!
Furthermore, you can
have the phone now.
GILLIS
O.K.
(He gets up, starts
out, turns)
I find I'm terribly afraid of
losing you.
BETTY
You won't.
(She takes the glass
out of his hand)
I'll get us a refill of
this awful stuff.
GILLIS
You'll be waiting for me?
BETTY
With a wildly beating heart.
GILLIS
Life can be beautiful!
He leaves.

THE MAIN ROOM
Gillis squeezes himself through some guests to

He has to stand in a cramped position,

GILLIS AT THE PHONE
GILLIS

He hangs up the dead receiver, stands numb
with
shock.
Betty elbows her way up to him, carrying
the two punch glasses filled again.
BETTY
I just got the recipe: take
two packages of cough drops,
dissolve in one gallon of
lukewarm grape juice --
Gillis looks up at her.
Without a word he pushes
her aside so that she spills the drink.
He makes
his way through the guests to the Vicuna coat, pulls
it from the shelf, some books tumbling with it, and
rushes towards the door and out.
Betty stands look-
ing after him, completely bewildered.

Max is opening the door to let out the doctor, a
professional looking man carrying a black bag.
Gillis runs into the SHOT.
GILLIS
How is she?
MAX
She is upstairs.
Gillis starts to push past Max.
Max grabs his arm.

The car drives down Bronson and stops smack in front

A young policeman is talking to
an extra; an old policeman sits reading a newspaper.
Max sounds the horn impatiently.
YOUNG POLICEMAN
Hold that noise!
MAX
To see Mr. de Mille.
Open the gate.
YOUNG POLICEMAN
Mr. deMille is shooting.
You
got an appointment?
MAX
No appointment is necessary.
I
am bringing Norma Desmond.
YOUNG POLICEMAN
Norma Who?
Norma has rolled down the window on her side.
She
calls to the old policeman.
NORMA
Jonesy! Come here, Jonesy!
OLD POLICEMAN
Yeah?
(He comes forward slowly)
Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond!
How have you been, Miss Desmond?
NORMA
Fine, Jonesy.
Now open that gate.
OLD POLICEMAN
Sure, Miss Desmond.
(To the young policeman}
Come on, Mac.
YOUNG POLICEMAN
They can't drive on the lot
without a pass.
OLD POLICEMAN
Miss Desmond can.
Come on.
They fling open the gate.
OLD POLICEMAN
(As the car drives through)
Stage eighteen, Miss Desmond.
NORMA
Thank you, Jonesy.
And teach
your friend some manners.
Tell
him without me he wouldn't have
any job, because without me there
wouldn't be any Paramount Studio.

Go on.
They drive through the gates.
The old policeman
goes to wall phone beside the gate, dials a number.

STAGE 18
A scene from SAMPSON AND DELILAH is being rehearsed
in the background.
The usual turbulent activity
surrounds it: extras.
makeup men, grips,
assistants, etc., etc.
In the dim foreground a
stage hand is answering a stand telephone.
He
puts down the phone and moves (CAMERA WITH HIM)
to a second assistant.
STAGE HAND
Norma Desmond is coming to see
Mr. deMille.
The second assistant walks (CAMERA WITH HIM)
to the first assistant.
2nd ASSISTANT
Norma Desmond coming in to
see Mr. deMille.
The first assistant (CAMERA WITH HIM) hurries
to the set.
Sitting with his back toward us
is C.B. himself.
He is rehearsing a scene with
Hedy Lamarr.
1ST ASSISTANT
Norma Desmond is coming in to
see you, Mr. deMille.
C. B. turns his head.
DEMILLE
Norma Desmond?
lst ASSISTANT
She must be a million years old.
DEMILLE
I hate to think where that puts
me.
I could be her father.
1ST ASSISTANT
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
By this time de Mille is on his feet.
DEMILLE
It must be about that appalling
script of hers.
What can I say
to her? What can I say?
1ST ASSISTANT
I can tell her you're all tied
up in the projection room.
I
can give her the brush ...
DEMILLE
Listen, thirty million fans
have given her the brush.
Isn't that enough?
1ST ASSISTANT
I didn't mean to --
DEMILLE
Of course you didn't.
You didn't
know Norma Desmond as a plucky
little girl of seventeen, with
more courage and wit and heart
than ever came together in one
youngster.
1ST ASSISTANT
I hear she was a terror to
work with.
DEMILLE
She got to be.
A dozen press
agents working overtime can
do terrible things to the human
spirit.

He leaves, accompanied by his entourage.

Norma's limousine drives up.
Max dismounts

NORMA

Don't you want to come along,
darling?
GILLIS
I don't think so.
It's your
script.
It's your show.
Good luck.

Thank you, darling.
She presses his hand against her cheek, descends
from the car and walks toward -

THE DOOR OF STAGE 18
The first assistant is holding it open.
In the door-
way stands Mr. deMille.
Seeing Norma, he stretches
out his arms.
DE MILLE
Hello, young fellow.
NORMA
Hello, Mr. deMille.
She has reached him.
They embrace.
NORMA
Last time I saw you was someplace
very gay.
I remember waving to you.
I was dancing on a table.
DE MILLE
Lots of people were.
Lindbergh had
just landed in Paris.
Come on in.
He leads her into
D-13
STAGE 18
During the ensuing dialogue, Mr. deMille walks Norma
towards the set.
DE MILLE
Norma, I want to apologize for
not calling you.
NORMA
You'd better.
I'm very angry.
DE MILLE
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
NORMA
That's no excuse.
You read the
script, didn't you?
DE MILLE
Yes, I did.
NORMA
Then you could have picked up the
phone yourself instead of leaving
it to one of your assistants.
DE MILLE
What assistant?
NORMA
Don't play innocent.
Somebody
named Gordon Cole.
DE MILLE
Gordon Cole?
NORMA
And if you hadn't been pretty
darned interested in that script,
he wouldn't have tried to get
me on the phone ten times.
DE MILLE
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma,
I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.
(Indicating his
own chair)
Make yourself comfortable.
He walks onto the set, accompanied by his assistants.
DE MILLE
(Sotto voce, to his
first assistant)
Get me Gordon Cole on the phone.
Meanwhile, Norma starts to sit, sees the name
MISS LAMARR on the chair and with a look of
distaste changes and sits on the one marked
C.B. DE MILLE.
From somewhere comes
A VOICE
Hey, Miss Desmond! Miss Desmond!
She looks around her.
VOICE
Up here!
Norma looks up at the scaffolding.
On the scaffold stands one of the electricians,
next to his light.
ELECTRICIAN
It's met It's Hog-eyel
Norma waves at him.
NORMA
Hello.
Hog-eye points his light at her.
HOG-EYE
Let's get a look at you.
The beam of the lamp moves toward Norma.
It hits
her.
She sits bathed in light.
A couple of old
costume extras recognize her.
EXTRAS
Say, it's Norma! Norma Desmond!
They rush over and start wringing her hand.
Into
the shot comes a middle-aged hairdresser.
HAIRDRESSER
Hello, Miss Desmond.
It's Bessie.
Some elderly electricians and stagehands move in.

GORDON COLE, ON THE PHONE
COLE
It's that car of hers -- an old

It looks just right for the Crosby

We want to rent it for a
couple of weeks.
D-18
DE MILLE ON THE PHONE
DE MILLE
(Troubled)
Oh.
Well, thank you.
He hangs up, walks back towards Norma.
(CAMERA
WITH HIM).
Norma stills sits in the shaft of light, surrounded
by about a dozen people who have come up to pay court.
DeMille gestures up to Hog-eye and the light shifts
away.
The people about Norma disperse slowly with
various ad-libs.
DE MILLE
Well, Norma ...
(He sits down next to her)
I got hold of Gordon Cole.
Norma hasn't heard a word.
NORMA
Did you see them? Did you see
how they came?
DE MILLE
You know, crazy things happen in
this business.
I hope you haven't
lost your sense of humor ...
Suddenly he realizes that she is crying.
She takes
the handkerchief from his pocket and puts it over her
eyes.
DEMILLE
What's the matter, Norma?
NORMA
Nothing.
I just didn't realize
what it would be like to come back
to the old studio.
I had no idea
how I'd missed it.
DEMILLE
We've missed you too, dear.
NORMA
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief?
We'll make our greatest picture.
DEMILLE
That's what I want to talk to you about.
NORMA
It's a good script, isn't it?
DEMILLE
It's got a lot of good things.
Of
course, it would be an expensive picture...
NORMA
I don't care about the money.
I just want to work again.
You
don't know what it means to know
that you want me.
DEMILLE
Nothing would thrill me more --
if it were possible.
NORMA
But remember, darling -- I don't
work before ten in the morning,
and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
The first assistant comes up.
1ST ASSISTANT
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
DEMILLE
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why
don't you just sit and watch?

car.
MAX

building opposite)
You see those offices there, Mr.
Gillis? They used to be her
dressing room, The whole row.
GILLIS
That didn't leave much for Wallace
Reid.
MAX
He had a great big bungalow on
wheels.
I had the upstairs.
See
where it says 'Readers' Department'?
I remember my walls were covered
with black patent leather...
The words "Readers' Department" have registered on
Gillis' mind.
He gets out of the car.
GILLIS
I'll be with you in a minute.
He crosses the street towards the green staircase
leading to the second floor.
Meanwhile, two prop men walking down the street
come into the SHOT.

Hey, that's the comic car Cole
was talking about!

Do you mind if we look inside?
MAX
Go away.
Go away.

CUBICLE IN THE READERS' DEPARTMENT
Behind the desk sits Betty, typing the synopsis of
a novel, a half-eaten apple marking her place.
The
door behind her opens and Gillis enters.
GILLIS
Just so you don't think I'm a
complete swine -- if there's
anything in Dark Windows you
can use, take it.
It's all
yours.
BETTY
Well, for heaven's sake!
She moves the book and the apple aside and points at
the free space on the desk.
BETTY
Have a chair.
Gillis sits on the desk.
GILLIS
I mean it.
It's no good to me
anyway.
Help yourself.
BETTY
Why should you do that?
GILLIS
If you get a hundred thousand for
it, you buy me a box of chocolate
creams.
If you get an Oscar, I
get the left foot.
BETTY
You know, I'd take you up on that
in a minute.
I'm just not good
enough to do it all by myself.
GILLIS
What about all those ideas you had?
BETTY
See if they make sense.
To begin
with, I think you should throw out
all that psychological stuff --
exploring a killer's sick mind.
GILLIS
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
BETTY
This story is about teachers --
their threadbare lives, their
struggles.
Here are people doing
the most important job in the
world, and they have to wprry
about getting enough money to
re-sole their shoes.
To me it
can be as exciting as any chase,
any gunplay.
GILLIS
Check.
BETTY
Now I see her teaching day classes
while he teaches night school.
The
first time they meet ...
From below comes the SOUND of the Isotta's horn.
GILLIS
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't
got time to listen to the whole
plot ...
BETTY
I'll make it short.
GILLIS
Sorry.
It's your baby now.
BETTY
I'm not good enough to write it
alone.
We'll have to do it together.
GILLIS
I'm all tied up.
I can't.
BETTY
Couldn't we work in the evenings?
Six o'clock in the morning? This
next month I'm completely at your
disposal.
Artie is out of town.
GILLIS
What has Artie to do with it.
BETTY
We're engaged.
GILLIS
Good for you.
You've got yourself
the best guy in town.
BETTY
I think so.
They're on location
in Arizona, shooting a Western.
I'm free every evening, every week-
end.
If you want, we could work at
your place.
GILLIS
It's just impossible.
BETTY
Nobody can be that busy.
There is another honk: from down below.
GILLIS
Look, Betty, It can't be done.
It's out.
BETTY
You're tough, all right.
GILLIS
You're on your own.
Stop being
chicken-hearted and write that story.
BETTY
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
GILLIS
(Turning 1n the open door)
And don't make it too dreary.
How
about this for a situation: she
teaches daytimes.
He teaches at
night.
Right?
They don't even know
each other, but they share the same
room.
It's cheaper that way.
As a
matter of fact, they sleep in the
same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
BETTY
Are you kidding? Because I think
it's good.
GILLIS
So do I.
BETTY
Came
on back.
Let me show you
where it fits in.
She reaches in a drawer for her notes on Dark
Windows.
GILLIS
(At the door)
So long.
Betty picks up the apple and is about to throw it
after him.
BETTY
Oh, you --
GILLIS
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR
THE TEACHER.
He ducks out quiokly, slamming the door behind him.
Betty looks after him, then angrlly hurls the
apple into the wastebasket.

I'm not worried.
Everything will
be fine.
The old team together.
Nothing can stop us.
She turns and walks out of the shot.
De Mille
stands for a second watching her, then turns to
his assistant.
DE MILLE
Get Gordon Cole.
Tell him to forget

He can find another
old car.
I'll buy him five old cars,
if necessary.

Gillis seated in the rear.
Max is helping Norma
in and putting the robe over her.
GILLIS
(Apprehensively)
How did it go?
NORMA
It couldn't have gone better.
It's practically set.
Of course,
he has to finish this picture
first, but mine will be his next.
There is an exchange of looks between Max and Gillis.
GILLIS
He must be quite a guy.
NORMA
He'a a shrewd old fox.
He can
smell box office.
Only I'm going
to outfox him a litt1e.
This isn't
going to be C. B. deMille's Salome.
It's going to be Norma Desmond's
Salome, a Norma Desmond Production,
starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
MAX
Yes, Miss Desmond.
As he says the words, he and Gillis exchange a glance

She gets up and crosses to the door of Gillis' room

GILLIS' ROOM
It is dark except for a lamp over the chaise longue.
Gillis lies on it, fully clothed, reading a book.
GILLIS
Yes, Norma.
Through the slit in the door there is a suggestion
of Norma.
NORMA
Don't turn around.
Keep your
eyes on the book.
GILLIS
Yes, Norma.
Norma pushes the door open and comes in.
NORMA
I just came to say good night.
I don't want you to see me --
I'm not very attractive.
GILLIS
Good night.
NORMA
I've lost half a pound since
Tuesday.
GILLIS
Good.
NORMA
I was a little worried about the
line of my throat.
This woman
has done wonders with it.
GILLIS
Good.
NORMA
You'd better get to bed yourself.
GILLIS
I think I'll read a little.
NORMA
You went out last night, didn't
you, Joe?
GILLIS
Why do you say that?
NORMA
I just happen to know it.
I had
a nightmare and I screamed for
you.
You weren't here.
Where
were you?
GILLIS
I went for a walk.
NORMA
No you didn't.
You took the
car.
GILLIS
All right, I drove to the beach.
Norma, you don't want me to feel
I'm locked up in this house?
NORMA
Of course not, Joe.
It's just
that I don't want to be left alone.
Not now, while I'm under this
terrible strain.
My nerves are
being torn apart.
All I ask is
for you to be a little patient and a
little kind.
GILLIS
I haven't done anything, Norma.
NORMA
Of course you haven't.
I wouldn't
let you.
She bends and kisses the top of his head.
NORMA
Good night, my darling.
She goes into her room, shutting the door behind her.
Gillis puts his book down and looks at her door.

Oh, that.

GILLIS
I gave her some advice on an

BETTY
Look at this street.
All card-

All done with mirrors.
I like
it better than any street in the
world.
Maybe because I used to
play here when I was a kid.
GILLIS
What were you -- a child actress?
BETTY
I was born just two blocks from
this studio.
Right on Lemon Grove
Avenue.
Father was head elec-
trician here till he died.
Mother
still works in Wardrobe.
GILLIS
Second generation, huh?
BETTY
Third.
Grandma did stunt work
for Pearl White.
I come from a
picture family.
Naturally they
took it for granted I was to become
a great star.
So I had ten years of
dramatic lessons, diction, dancing.
Then the studio made a test.
Well,
they didn't like my nose -- it slanted
this way a little.
I went to a doctor
and had it fixed.
They made more
tests, and they were crazy about my
nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
GILLIS
(Examining her nose
by the flame of his
lighter)
Nice job.
BETTY
Should be.
It cost three hundred
dollars.
GILLIS
Saddest thing I ever heard.
BETTY
Not at all.
It taught me a little
sense.
I got me a job in the mail
room, worked up to the Stenographic.
Now I'm a reader...
GILLIS
Come clean, Betty.
At night you
weep for those lost closeups, those
gala openings...
BETTY
Not once.
What's wrong with being
on the other side of the cameras?
It's really more fun.
GILLIS
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer!
I will now kiss that nose of yours.
BETTY
If you please.
Gillis kisses her nose.
As he stands there, his
face close to hers -
GILLIS
May I say you smell real special.
BETTY
It must be my new shampoo.
GILLIS
That's no shampoo.
It'smore like
a pile of freehly laundred hand-
kerchiefs, like a brand new auto-
mobile.
How old are you anyway?
BETTY
Twenty-two.
GILLIS
That's it -- there's nothing like
being twenty-two.
Now may I suggest
that if we're ever to finish this
story you keep at least two feet
away from me ...

Gillis gets out.
From the seat next him he takes a
batch of script, folds it and puts it in his pocket.
He suddenly becomes aware that he is watched, turns.
Max stands in the moonlight, evidently waiting for
him.
GILLIS
What is it, Max? Want to wash
the car, or are you doing a little
spying in your off hours?
MAX
You must be very careful as you
cross the patio.
Madame may be
watching.
GILLIS
How about my going up the kitchen
stairs and undressing in the dark.
Will that do it?
MAX
I'm not inquiring where Mr.
Gillis goes every night...
GILLIS
Why don't you? I'm writing a
script and I'm dying to finish
it, no matter what.
MAX
It's just that I'm very worried
about Madame.
GILLIS
Sure you are.
And we're not help-
ing her any, feeding her lies and
more lies.
Getting herself ready
for a pioture ...
What happens when
she finds out?
MAX
She never will.
That is my job.
It has been for a long time.
You
must understand I discovered her
when she was eighteen.
I made her
a star.
I cannot let her be destroyed.
GILLIS
You made her a star?
MAX
I directed all her early pictures.
There were three young directors
who showed promise in those days:
D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and
Max von Mayerling.
GILLIS
And she's turned you into a
servant.
MAX
It was I who asked to come back,
humiliating as it may seem.
I
could have gone on witn my career,
only I found everything unendur-
able arter she divorced me.
You

Her eyes fall on Gillis' coat, which hangs over a
chair.
In a pocket is part of the script.
Norma

She can't see it in the

She hurries with it into:

Betty, wake up!

catches her attention)
Why are you staring at me like that?
BETTY

I'm sorry.

Something came up.
I don't want

It's nothing.
I got a telegram

GILLIS
From Artie.
What's wrong?
BETTY
He wants me to come on to Arizona.
He says it only oosts two dollars
to get married there.
It would
kind of save us a honeymoon.

Why don't you? We can finish the
script by Thursday.
Betty stands crying silently.
GILLIS
Stop crying.
You're getting
married.
That's what you've
always wanted.
BETTY
I don't want it now.
GILLIS
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
BETTY
Of course I love him.
I always
will.
I'm just not in love
