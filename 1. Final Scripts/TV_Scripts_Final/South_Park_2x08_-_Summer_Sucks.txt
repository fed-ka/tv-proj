               Establishing.

               INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

               Mr. Garrison stands in front of the students.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay children, I know that today is 
                         the last day of school, and that the 
                         last day of school involves pranks... 
                         But this is GOING TOO FAR!!

               The kids all stare blankly.

               Mr. Garrison is holding is right arm up, but nothing is on 
               it.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Now what have you done with Mr. Hat?!

               The kids don't move.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         CHILDREN! I WANT MR. HAT BACK RIGHT 
                         NOW! THE PRANK IS OVER!!

               The kids don't move.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You think I can't get along without 
                         Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't 
                         live without him?! Well I can! He's 
                         just a puppet! I don't need him! You 
                         see? Watch...

               Mr. Garrison folds his hands on his desk and tries to look 
               normal. But he's obviously shaking.

               The kids just stare on.

               Finally, Garrison breaks.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         GOD DAMMIT WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU 
                         PUT MR. HAT?!?

               The school bell rings.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, no you don't! The school year is 
                         over, but Summer vacation doesn't 
                         start for you little bastards until 
                         Mr. Hat is BACK ON MY DESK! Now I'm 
                         going to turn around, and when I 
                         turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat 
                         lying right here!

               Garrison turns around. He sits with his back to us for several 
               seconds, then:

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay... I'm going to turn around 
                         now.

               Garrison turns back around to see that everybody is gone. 
               Except for Pip.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         SHIT!

                                     PIP
                         Where did everybody go?

               EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

               As the children race out of the building, the snow on the 
               ground melts away -- it's the last day of school and the 
               first day of summer in South Park.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET - DAY

               A huge mound of snow melts and out emerges KEVIN, the same 
               little boy we saw earlier on the poster. Kevin's MOTHER and 
               FATHER run up to him.

                                     KEVIN'S MOTHER
                         Oh golly Kevin, honey.

                                     KEVIN'S FATHER
                         Good to see you again, son.

               All three hug.

               A MAN steps out of his house and breathes in the warm summer 
               air and then...

                                     THE MAN
                         Looks like winter's right around the 
                         corner. Better get some fire wood 
                         ready!

               The man pulls out a chainsaw and cuts down a tree.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               All the trees in the forest start dropping.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

               The boys continue on, as school children run and play and 
               squeal with delight. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny walk past 
               Pip.

                                     PIP
                         Oh, happy Summer, gentlemen!

                                     STAN
                         Shut up, Pip.

                                     PIP
                         Right-o. Uh, enjoy some of the summer 
                         for me, would you?

                                     KYLE
                         What do you mean?

                                     PIP
                         Well, I have to spend my summer in 
                         summer school, because I can't be 
                         left alone. You see, my parents are 
                         dead.

               The boys just stand there, blinking, with nothing to say. 
               Finally, Cartman speaks up.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Your parents are dead? God damn you 
                         suck, Pip!

               The boys walk off laughing.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET - DAY

               The boys walk down the street, passing a sign for 'Stu's 
               fireworks'.

                                     STAN
                         Oh yeah, dude! It's summer, that 
                         means we gotta buy fireworks!

                                     KYLE
                         I saved up enough money to buy m-
                         80's this year.

                                     STAN
                         I saw in this movie once where this 
                         guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's 
                         butt.

                                     KYLE
                         Cool! Maybe we can do that to 
                         Cartman's cat.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AY! IF YOU SO MUCH AS TOUCH KITTY'S 
                         ASS I'LL PUT FIRECRACKERS IN YOUR 
                         NUTSACK AND BLOW YOUR BALLS ALL OVER 
                         YOUR PANTS!!

                                     STAN
                         Jesus, Cartman...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, I'm just sayin' na, don't mess 
                         with kitty, na.

               INT. STU'S GIFTS/SOUVENIRS/FIREWORKS - DAY

               Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny enter the store.

               STU, a big fat guy who breathes heavy and wears a shirt that 
               doesn't fully cover his belly, stands behind the counter.

                                     STU
                         Hi, fellas.

                                     THE BOYS
                         Hi, Stu.

                                     STU
                         What can I do you for?

                                     KYLE
                         We wanna buy m-80's.

                                     STAN
                         The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's 
                         ass.

               Stan, Kyle and Kenny laugh.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay! That does it! Screw you guys! 
                         I'm going home!

               Cartman walks away.

                                     KYLE
                         What a baby.

                                     STAN
                         So, we'll have ten m-80's please.

                                     STU
                         I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?

                                     STAN
                         Heard what?

                                     STU
                         All fireworks have been banned in 
                         Colorado.

                                     KYLE
                         What'dya mean?

                                     STU
                         It was in the paper this morning.

               Stu shows them the paper. On the front page is a picture of 
               a LITTLE BOY who has no hands. Under the picture, the caption 
               reads, "NORTH PARK BOY LOSES HANDS IN FIRECRACKER ACCIDENT."

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, just cuz some stupid North 
                         Park kid blew his hands off, we don't 
                         get to buy m-80's?!

                                     STU
                         Right.

                                     STAN
                         How can they do this to us? Doesn't 
                         anyone believe in tradition anymore?

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, we've been playing with 
                         firecrackers our whole lives.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET - DAY

               Circa 1991. The boys are playing with firecrackers. They 
               look exactly the same, except they are tiny one-year olds.

               Suddenly, a firecracker explodes and kills little baby Kenny.

                                     BABY STAN
                         Goo, goo goo! killed Kenny!!

                                     BABY KYLE
                              (shaking his fists)
                         Ooo bastards!

                                                          DISSOLVE BACK TO:

               INT. STU'S GIFTS/SOUVENIRS/FIREWORKS - DAY

               Back to the present.

                                     STAN
                         A summer without firecrackers is 
                         like... I don't know what it's like, 
                         but it sucks ass.

                                     KYLE
                         Yea, now what are we suppose to do?

               Stu pulls out a bunch of lame Fourth of July paraphernalia.

                                     STU
                         I can still sell snakes!

               Stu lights the little black disc, and the short, stupid 
               uneventful ash snake comes out.

                                     BOYS
                         Aww!!

               INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               The mayor is sitting behind her desk, yelling into the phone.

                                     MAYOR
                              (into the phone)
                         This is absurd! We need fireworks 
                         for our Fourth of July celebration 
                         at the lake.
                              (pause)
                         I don't care that some twerp blew 
                         his hands off. We've got to have 
                         fireworks for our picnic -- Hold on 
                         I've got another call...

               She switches over.

                                     MAYOR
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         No I don't know where Mr. Hat is! 
                         Jesus, Garrison I've got bigger 
                         problems!!

               She switches back.

                                     MAYOR
                         Hello? Yes, now what am I supposed 
                         to do about our Fourth of July Show 
                         at the Lake?
                              (pause)
                         No, I don't want snakes! This is an 
                         outrage! Get me the mayor!
                              (beat)
                         I know that, smart ass, I was being 
                         ironic!

               She slams down the phone.

               Suddenly, Barbrady comes out from under the desk.

                                     BARBRADY
                         I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't 
                         find the little man in the boat.

                                     MAYOR
                         Well, keep looking.

               He disappears back under the desk.

                                     MAYOR
                              (to herself)
                         This is ridiculous. We can't have a 
                         celebration without fireworks. Who 
                         ever heard of a Fourth of July picnic 
                         with snakes?

                                     BARBRADY
                              (From under the desk)
                         Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and 
                         they grow and grow...

                                     MAYOR
                         Wait a minute. That's it! I've got 
                         it! This Fourth of July, South Park 
                         will make history by having the 
                         largest snake in the world! The press 
                         will love it. I'll be on the front 
                         page... Oooh.

                                     BARBRADY
                         I found him.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET - NIGHT

               Kyle, Cartman, Stan and Kenny are standing at the busstop. 
               There is no snow around them.

               They just stand there, blinking.

                                     STAN
                         Man, it's hot out here.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What do you guys wanna do? We have 
                         the whole summer to play!

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, what are we supposed to do? We 
                         always just played with fireworks.

                                     STAN
                         I know! Let's go sledding!

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah!

               EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET - DAY

               Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are sitting on a sled at the top of a 
               grassy hill. Cartman stands behind them.

                                     STAN
                         Come on, Cartman, get on.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Stan?

                                     KYLE
                         Let's go, dude. We're ready.

                                     STAN
                         What the hell are you waiting for, 
                         Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong 
                         with this picture?

                                     KYLE
                         Yea, your fat ass isn't on the sled!

               Cartman reluctantly gets on the back of the sled.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Whatever.

               The sled slides down the grassy hill about an inch and then 
               stops.

               The boys blink.

                                     STAN
                         What the hell is going on?

               Just then Jimbo and Ned drive up in Jimbo's hummer.

                                     JIMBO
                         Hey there, boys!

                                     STAN
                         Hi, Uncle Jimbo.

                                     JIMBO
                         How come you're not out blowing things 
                         up? It's summer?

                                     KYLE
                         Didn't you hear? That outlawed 
                         fireworks cuz a little boy blew off 
                         his hands.

                                     JIMBO
                         WHAT?!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, they're not even having them 
                         at the lake this year.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh my God! Well, don't worry boys, 
                         Uncle Jimbo is on the case!

               Jimbo speeds away.

               EXT./INT. JIMBO'S VAN - DAY

               Jimbo and Ned are in the van heading South.

                                     JIMBO
                         Buckle your seatbelt, Ned.

                                     NED
                         Where are we going?

                                     JIMBO
                         Mexico, my amigo.

                                     NED
                         Why are we going to Mexico?

                                     JIMBO
                         To buy fireworks. Just cuz some kid 
                         blew off his hands, doesn't mean the 
                         rest of us have to suffer, now does 
                         it?

                                     NED
                         Are fireworks legal in Mexico?

                                     JIMBO
                         Hell, everything's legal in Mexico. 
                         It's the American way.

               INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Mayor and her aides are listening to a presentation by 
               the DYNO-MIGHT firework company. The Mayor is sitting at her 
               desk with her fingers on her chin, as CHARLIE, the DYNO-MIGHT 
               owner talks with diagrams and a pointer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         At the Dyno-might firework company, 
                         we have a commitment to excellence. 
                         Our focus is on safety while --

                                     MAYOR
                         Just cut to the chase and tell us 
                         about the snake!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, okay...

               Charlie flips through a few of his presentation boards, past 
               the ones that say 'Introduction' and 'Safety Features' and 
               'We Value the Customer', and finally settling on one that is 
               a diagram of the huge disc itself.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now, the disc that we're making is 
                         approximately 5,000 times bigger 
                         than an average snake.

                                     MAYOR
                         Ooh!

                                     CHARLIE
                         We'll have to fly it in with three 
                         Comanche Helicopters, and lower on 
                         to the ground at the lake.

                                     MAYOR
                              (scribbling)
                         Comanche helicopters...

               Now Charlie flips the diagram to another one.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then, we'll need 57 flamethrowers, 
                         all set up around the perimeter of 
                         the disc, that are triggered to all 
                         fire at the same time.

                                     MAYOR
                         Flamethrowers... Triggered at the 
                         same time.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Once lit, the snake will grow...

               He flips to yet another diagram. This one a drawing of the 
               snake emerging happily from the disc.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And good times will be had by all.

               The aide flips to a photo of Abe Vigoda tipping his hat and 
               smiling. The Mayor and her aides applaud.

                                     AIDE #2
                         Wonderful.

                                     AIDE #1
                         Spectacular.

                                     MAYOR
                         Well, you see? The fireworks at the 
                         lake will not only go on, but perhaps 
                         be the best ever!
                              (suddenly)
                         Wait a minute! We're gonna need an 
                         orchestra to play the Stars and 
                         Stripes!

                                     AIDE #2
                         Hey! How about the elementary school 
                         orchestra! They did a great version 
                         of 'Mary Had A Little Lamb' at their 
                         last concert.

                                     MAYOR
                         Yes! Get the school Principal on the 
                         phone! And we need somebody to dress 
                         up like Uncle Remus!

                                     AIDE #1
                         Uh, mayor, I think you mean Uncle 
                         Sam?

                                     MAYOR
                         OF COURSE I DO, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!

               EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET - DAY

               The boys are building a "snowman" out of rocks, sticks and 
               dirt.

                                     KYLE
                              (singing)
                         Dusty the dirtball...

                                     STAN
                         Why does everything have to suck so 
                         bad in summer?

               Mr. Garrison walks up. He looks like total shit. He is 
               unshaven and shaking.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey look, it's Mr. Garrison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Hello children. How is your summer 
                         going.

                                     STAN
                         Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, oh, that old thing? Why, I almost 
                         forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. 
                         Hat.

                                     STAN
                         That's good.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Mr. Hat is just a puppet.

                                     KYLE
                         Yup.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Mr. Hat isn't real.

                                     STAN
                         Right.

               Mr. Garrison just stands there and blinks for a long time.

               Finally, he just walks away.

               The boys go back to their snowman.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey you guys, my mom signed me up 
                         for swimming lessons at the community 
                         pool. You wanna come?

               Stan, Kyle and Kenny crack up laughing.

                                     STAN
                         Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the 
                         lamest thing I've ever heard.

                                     CARTMAN
                         It is not!

                                     STAN
                         Everyone knows that the first graders 
                         pee in the community pool.

                                     KYLE
                         Yea, Cartman, you're swimming around 
                         in first grader pee.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AY! I am not swimming around in pee!

                                     STAN
                         Whatever, dude.

                                     CARTMAN
                         My mom says that if I take swimming

                         bad situation! I don't need to hear 
                         crap from a bunch of hippie freaks 
                         living in denial!!

                         Uh. Screw you guys... home.

               Cartman storms off.

                         What does he mean 'living in denial'?

               EXT. COMMUNITY POOL - DAY

               A few children play and frolic in the pool.

               Cartman is standing outside the pool in his swimming trunks, 
               but still wearing his little blue hat.

               Cartman walks up slowly to the edge of the pool and sticks a 
               toe in.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AGH!

               He runs further away.

               The LIFEGUARD, dressed in a red swimsuit, blows her whistle.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Okay kids, everyone in the pool!

               A few more kids jump in. Cartman is left alone at the other 
               end.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Come on, Eric we're gonna start now!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Nuh-uh.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Just jump in.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't wanna.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         It's not going to hurt you, hon, 
                         just do it.

               Cartman takes a deep breath, then jumps into the water.

                                     CARTMAN
                         BLAH! UGH!!

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         There you go! Now just let the first 
                         graders swim by you, and then head 
                         towards us.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Huh? First Graders???

               Just then, three little FIRST GRADERS merrily swim by. They 
               pause in front of Cartman, and some of the water turns yellow.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY!! AW!!!! WEAK!! WEAK!!

               The first graders swim on by.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, you sons a bitches!!

               EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY

               South Park residents are hanging balloons, setting up food 
               tents and building bleachers for the big event.

                                     MAYOR
                              (checking her watch)
                         Where the hell is our firework?! We 
                         only have 24 hours!

                         I'm sure it will be here any second.

                                     MAYOR
                         Shut up!

                                     AIDE
                         Copy that.

               Meanwhile, the boys are all on a small stage with the rest 
               of their classmates. They are all with musical instruments.

               The music teacher steps up with a little baton.

                                     MR. ROMERO
                         Okay, children, I'm sure we're a 
                         little rusty -- Where is Eric Cartman?

                                     STAN
                         He's taking swimming lessons.

                                     MR. ROMERO
                         Oh dear, how are we supposed to sound 
                         good without our French Horn section? 
                         Well, let's try some scales first -- 
                         C scale first. And --

               Mr. Romero conducts his arms, and the kids start playing the 
               most God awful mix of noises you've ever heard.

               Finally, they stop.

                                     MR. ROMERO
                         Okay, that was pretty good. Let's 
                         play Mozart's symphony number 5...

               Mr. Romero lowers his hands. The kids play the same God awful 
               sound.

                                     MAYOR
                         Oh, we're doomed. Our fourth of July 
                         celebration is going to have no 
                         fireworks and a bunch of tone deaf 
                         little shits playing -- wait a minute --

               Just then, a distant chopping sound is heard. The Mayor looks 
               up.

                                     MAYOR
                         It's the snake!

               Three Comanche helicopters fly over South Park. It's got the 
               gigantic snake attached to it.

               South Park residents hoot and holler as they watch the 
               helicopter fly overhead.

               Jimbo and Ned walk into the crappy little Mexican store.

               The Owner hands them a large box with whatever the Spanish

               Jimbo opens the box.

                                     JIMBO
                         Would you look at that, Ned? That's 
                         a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies

               INT. MR. GARRISON'S HOUSE

               Mr. Garrison is just sitting in his chair, doing nothing. 
               Mr. Hat is still nowhere to be seen.

               Finally, the phone rings. Garrison reaches over and answers 
               it immediately.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         HELLO?!

                                     VOICE
                              (sounds suspiciously 
                              like Mr. Mackey)
                         Hello, is Mr. Hat there?

               Mr. Garrison thinks.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Is this some kind of joke?!

                                     VOICE
                              (laughing)
                         Yes.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You go to hell! You go to hell and 
                         you DIE!!

               The voice just keeps laughing.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I'm gonna find out who you are!

                                     VOICE
                         I don't think you can, mmkay...

               The line goes dead.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         God Dammit!

               Garrison grabs the remote and turns on the television. He 
               flips through the channels.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               The title reads 'Shari Lewis and Friends!'

               Shari Lewis appears wearing her hand puppet, Lambchop.

                                     SHARI LEWIS
                         So, Lambchomp, what would you like 
                         to do today?

                                     LAMBCHOMP
                         Well, I'd like to sing you a song!

                                     SHARI LEWIS
                         Hey, let's sing one TOGETHER!

               Music begins.

               ANGLE - GARRISON

               He's resting his head on his hand and looking really pissed 
               off.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               Shari and Lambchop sing.

                                     SHARI AND LAMBCHOP
                              (singing)
                         As long as we're together we can do 
                         anything! We can take on the whole 
                         darn world!

               ANGLE - GARRISON

               Just sitting there, pissed.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

                                     SHARI AND LAMBCHOP
                         We're happy as clams! With plenty of 
                         pearls! Through thick and thin, we've 
                         always been to-geth-er!

               ANGLE - GARRISON

               ZOOM IN on Garrison's face -- into his thoughts...

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               Now, as Shari and Lambchop continue to sing, Garrison appears 
               next to them.

               He grins an evil grin, then pulls out a hatchet.

               He chops off Shari's arm with the hatchet. She screams. He 
               takes lambchomp from the severed hand, and throws it on a 
               nearby grill.

                                     SHARI LEWIS
                         NOO!! LAMBCHOP NOOO!!!

               Lambchop lies dying on the hot grill.

                                     LAMBCHOP
                         Shari... Help me...

                                     LAMBCHOMP
                         It burns!!! It burns!!!!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GARRISON'S HOUSE

               Garrison is back sitting in his chair, with a huge smile on 
               his face, as the stupid singing continues from the television.

               EXT. COMMUNITY POOL - DAY

               Cartman is standing in the shallow end of the pool, looking 
               at all the other kids and the lifeguard at the deep end of 
               the pool.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Eric, you have to get in the deep 
                         end sooner or later.

                         Later's fine.

                         I only know how to do it doggie style.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         That's doggie-PADDLE, Eric. Now come 
                         over here!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Can I do it doggie style?

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Okay.

               Cartman starts to waddle towards the deep end.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         That's it! That's it! You can do it!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Sweet...

               But again, just then, the first graders come giggling and 
               swimming by.

               They swim by and turn the water around Eric yellow again.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AW! DAMMIT!! AAGHAGH NOT AGAIN!!

               Cartman scrambles around back to the shallow end.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Come on, Eric!

                                     CARTMAN
                         NO WAY!! THOSE SONS OF BITCHES!... 
                         I'M GOING HOME

               INT. SOUTH PARK NEWS ROOM - DAY

               CHET, a newscaster, sits behind a desk.

                                     TOM
                         Fourth of July is finally here, and 
                         with a Statewide ban on fireworks, 
                         people from all over Colorado are 
                         flocking to South Park. Here with a 
                         special report is a normal looking 
                         guy with a funny name.

               EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY

               People are partying and celebrating.

               A newscaster is standing among the partying people. His name, 
               CREAMY GOODNESS, is printed at the bottom of the screen.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         Thanks, Tom. It looks like the 
                         firework ban won't be putting a damper 
                         on one town's festivities tonight...

               Creamy walks through scores of people who are having fun and 
               mugging for the camera.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         I'm here at Stark's Pond in South 
                         Park, where the crowd of residents 
                         and scores of tourists anxiously 
                         await the lighting of the largest 
                         snake in human history.

               Chet pulls out a package of traditional snakes.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         Now as most of you will probably 
                         remember, snakes are these little 
                         round discs that you light, and they 
                         spew out a little 'snake' of black 
                         ash. Well, the South Park's snake is 
                         over half a mile in diameter and 
                         twenty stories high...

               The camera cuts to the massive disc, as final preparations 
               are being made to it.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         I'm told that this event won't begin 
                         until the sun goes down and night is 
                         upon us.

               The sun quickly goes down. It's now dark.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         Alrighty then, looks like we're ready.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK LAKE - NIGHT

               The boys are assembled with the band. They're all wearing 
               tuxedos.

                                     STAN
                         How are your swimming lessons going, 
                         Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Fine...

                                     KYLE
                         I heard you won't even get in the 
                         deep end.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, you heard WRONG, hippie!!

               ANGLE ON THE MAYOR:

               She stands before the townspeople.

                                     MAYOR
                         Ladies and gentlemen. Good citizens 
                         of Colorado. It is my pleasure to be 
                         the first person to wish you all a 
                         Happy Fourth of July. Let's start 
                         with our school band playing the 
                         Stars and Stripes!!

                                     MR. ROMERO
                              (nervous)
                         This is it... And a one and a two 
                         and a --

               The kids all start playing The Stars and Stripes. It is barely 
               recognizable.

               The large crowd holds their hands over their ears.

               Mr. Romero continues to conduct as if he's in front of the 
               Boston Symphony Orchestra.

               The Mayor is terrified.

                                     MAYOR
                         What the fuck is that?

                                     MAYOR'S ASSISTANT
                         I think it's the Stars and Stripes.

                                     MAYOR
                         Oh hell. LIGHT THE SNAKE!!

               The crowd goes wild.

               Four men with big torches light the snake as the crowd cheers.

               ANGLE ON THE BOYS:

               They try to get a glimpse of the snake and play at the same 
               time.

               ANGLE ON THE SNAKE:

               As it continues burning, a pillar of hard black ash emerges 
               from the top, and starts to grow!

                                     TOWNSFOLK
                         Ooh!

               The column of ash grows up towards the sky.

                                     TOWNSFOLK
                         Ahh!

               EXT. MEXICO - NIGHT

               Jimbo's hummer drives down the highway towards some lights.

               INT. JIMBO'S HUMMER - MOVING

                                     JIMBO
                         Alright, Ned, now we're coming up to 
                         the American border. They can't know 
                         that we have fireworks in the trunk. 
                         Just let me do the talking.

               Jimbo thinks about what he just said a laughs a little.

                                     JIMBO
                         I guess that goes without saying, 
                         doesn't it...

               Jimbo laughs. Ned doesn't.

               A uniformed American Border Patrol officer holds his hand 
               out Jimbo stops his Hummer.

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Good evening, gentlemen.

                                     JIMBO
                         Hello there, fellow American. We're 
                         just anxious to get back to our 
                         homeland.

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Alright, I just need to ask you a 
                         few questions.

                                     JIMBO
                         Fire away, we have nothing to hide.

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Is anyone other than the two of you 
                         traveling in this vehicle?

                                     JIMBO
                         No sir.

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Do you have any firearms or explosives 
                         in the car.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yes.

               Ned looks at Jimbo, horrified.

                                     JIMBO
                         I mean NO!! NO!!

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Open your trunk please sir.

               The border patrol guy heads to the back. Jimbo snacks his 
               head repeatedly against the steering wheel.

                                     JIMBO
                         DAMN DAMN!! I ALWAYS GET THAT QUESTION 
                         WRONG!!

               EXT. STARK'S POND - SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

               The tourists are in still in awe, basking in the brilliant 
               glow of the continually growing snake. It is reaching epic 
               size.

               The kids are now in the second movement of the Stars and 
               Stripes. Romero still conducts happily, and Cartman turns 
               pages of sheet music as if he's reading it.

               The Mayor stands next to Charlie with a huge smile on her 
               face.

                                     MAYOR
                         My God, it's beautiful. It never 
                         fails to amaze me how I manage to 
                         overcome adversity!

               The Mayor watches as the huge column of hardened, black ash 
               continues to belch forth from the black disc.

               After QUITE A WHILE, the Mayor finally starts to lose her 
               smile.

                                     MAYOR
                         Say, uh, Charlie, when does that 
                         thing die out?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Die out?

                                     MAYOR
                         Yes, you know, expire, end.

               Charlie looks at her for a long time.

               A REALLY LONG TIME. He just sits there, staring at her, 
               thinking.

               Finally, the Mayor gets impatient.

                                     MAYOR
                         Hello? I'm asking you when it stops.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Uh... I'm not sure, I never made one 
                         this big.

               The snake is growing and growing to monstrous proportions.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I guess we didn't quite think this 
                         through, did we...

                                     MAYOR
                         WHAT?!

               The boys continue to play, but their eyes are fixed on the 
               their growing snake.

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, that thing is huge!!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, they need to shut it off.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY! YOU GUYS ARE SCREWING UP THE 
                         SONG!!

               Now all the tourists and residents start to look concerned. 
               As the snake spirals up to the sky, and finally collapses 
               under its weight!

               Everybody runs screaming as the huge pillar of ash heads for 
               the ground.

                                     TOWNSFOLK
                              (screaming)
                         Somebody stop it! It's out of control!

                                     THE BOYS
                         Aaaaah!!

               Stan, Kyle and Cartman dive out of the way. Kenny isn't as 
               quick.

                                     KYLE
                         Kenny! Watch out!

               Right in the nick of time, however, Kenny jumps out of the 
               way and ducks under the bleachers. Everyone is relieved.

               But the bleachers collapse and kill him.

                                     STAN
                         Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!

                                     KYLE
                              (shaking his fists at 
                              the bleachers)
                         You bastards!

               The boys immediately go back to playing.

               ANGLE ON THE ROGUE SNAKE:

               The growing snake continues to grow and spew.

                                     MAYOR

                         YOU TELL ME HOW MUCH LONGER THIS 
                         THING IS GONNA LAST!!

                         Uh... Let's see... a normal size 
                         snake lasts three minutes...

               The huge, massive snake slithers its way through Downtown, 
               knocking over each building slowly, as it goes

               The Snake continues to grow. The lake area is all but

                         Well, we're coming up on nine hours 
                         and the giant snake of South Park 
                         shows no signs of stopping. Residents 
                         have tried everything from firehoses 
                         to yelling at it, to make the snake 
                         stop, but nothing seems to work.

               EXT. BAHAMAS - DAY

               Chef is lying on a nice lounger, surrounded by beautiful, 
               busty women, drinking a Mai Tai One is massaging his 
               shoulders.

                                     CHEF

               One woman pours Chef a drink. Another takes his towel and 
               replaces it with a new.

               Just then the phone rings.

               Chef picks the phone up and puts it to his ear, and the women 
               continue doing what they were doing.

                                     CHEF
                         Hello? ... What? ...Oh, hello, 
                         children.

               Chef smiles at the ladies.

                                     CHEF
                         It's a what?... A giant snake?... 
                         Killing everybody?... Growing bigger?!

               Chef looks again at the ladies.

                         but... Well, futch ya.

               A title tell us we are In UTAH.

               Several white clothed white people are dipping a young man 
               in a large pool of water.

               Just then, the large black snake oozes itself through the 
               congregation. They all scream and die like the worthless 
               mother fuckers they are.

                         would he have gone? Why would he 
                         leave?

               Sitting across from Mr. Garrison is DR. KATZburg with his 
               fingers on his chin, and shaking.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Well... let me ask you this. Why... 
                         Where... Where do you think Mr. Hat... 
                         went?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         How the fuck should I know, if I 
                         knew that I wouldn't be seeing a 
                         fucking psychiatrist would I?!

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Well, I... guess I see what you're 
                         saying. Yeah.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         At first I was sure one of the 
                         children took him, but then I 
                         remembered that Mr. Hat and I had 
                         actually had a fight that morning --

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Um, are you gay?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         WHAT?!?!

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         It's... It's just a question.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Are you propositioning me?!

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         No.

                         percent NOT gay!

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Well, I believe you. I absolutely 
                         believe you.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Mr. Hat was gay?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Sometimes he fantasies about same 
                         sex relations.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         I see.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend 
                         he was in a Sauna with Brett Farvre 
                         and a bottle of Thousand Island 
                         dressing.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         That I did not need to know.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well, I'm just sayin'.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat 
                         was actually YOUR gay side trying to 
                         come out... You see it's, it's you 
                         that's gay, but, but you're in denial, 
                         so you act out your gay persona with 
                         a homosexual puppet.

               Mr. Garrison just sits there and thinks.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         What do you think about that?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I think YOU'RE the loony one in this 
                         room.

               The giant snake bursts through the glass, killing Katzburg 
               instantly.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Serves you right you gay bashing 
                         homo.

               Jimbo thinks.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yes?

               Ned shakes his head.

                                     JIMBO
                         DAMMIT I GOT IT WRONG AGAIN?! What's 
                         the answer again?

               But just then, another branch of the giant snake blasts 
               through the cell wall.

               sits down next to Mr. Hat.

                                     BRETT FARVRE
                         Hi. I haven't seen you in here before.

               CLOSE UP on Mr. Hat, he glances at Farvre.

               INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               A new reporter, this one more professional and sophisticated 
               stands out front of the blackened Mayor's office.

                                     REPORTER
                         As more and more cities are affected 
                         by the growing ash, and the death 
                         toll rises to three thousand, People 
                         from all over the country are looking 
                         to the Mayor of South Park for 
                         answers.

               People start bustling. The Mayor's aides walk down the steps.

                                     REPORTER
                         And it appears as if the Mayor is 
                         going to explain matters now!

               The Mayor's assistants take their places at a podium.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Uh... Ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor 
                         of South Park regrets that she cannot 
                         be here herself, but she is... sick.

               The reporters are outraged. Everybody SHOUTS AND JEERS.

                                     NEWSGUY
                         SICK?! WHAT KIND OF LAME EXCUSE IS 
                         THAT?!

                                     NEWSGUY #2
                         YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!

                                     NEWSGUY
                         Oh this is ridiculous!

                                     NEWSGUY #2
                         We want answers.

                                     ASSISTANT #2
                         She's having her period.

               Suddenly, everyone gets quiet.

                                     NEWSGUY
                         Oh.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         We do, however, have an official 
                         statement for all the concerned cities 
                         about the matter with the giant snake 
                         that we can't seem to put out.

               The assistant nudges the other assistant, who takes out a 
               piece of paper and reads it.

                                     ASSISTANT #2
                         We're sorry. Our bad.

               He folds the paper back up.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Thank you, that is all.

               The assistants quickly run back upstairs.

               Again the reporters burst out into shouts and Jeers.

               EXT. COMMUNITY POOL - DAY

                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay, no first graders around. I can 
                         swim to the deep end... I can do 
                         it... I can do it... I can, I'm gonna 
                         make it...

               EXT. EARTH - DAY

               From space, we can actually see the giant snake, in it's 
               branching out state taking over the U.S.

               EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY

               The boys are sitting by the giant disc watching it continue 
               to grow with bored expressions.

               One SOLITARY GUY stands next to them, holding a sign that 
               says 'This is it! repent your sins! The end is upon us!'

               The guy with the sign looks just as bored as the boys do.

                                     STAN
                         How many days left in summer?

                         I don't think it matters, dude. This 
                         giant snake is gonna kill everyone 
                         soon.

               Jimbo's big ass hummer screeches to a halt in front of the 
               boys.

                                     JIMBO
                         BUENOS GRACIAS, BOYS!!

                              (bored)
                         Hi uncle Jimbo.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh now, why the long faces?

                                     KYLE
                         We're bored!

                         There's nothing to do.

               Jimbo looks at the twisting, burning snake.

                                     JIMBO
                         Well... I don't think those are 
                         problems that some TIJUANA BOTTLE 
                         ROCKETS CAN'T SOLVE!!!

               Jimbo holds out the box.

                                     BOYS
                         HOORAY!!!!

               Jimbo and Ned hand out the large bottle rockets to the boys.

                                     JIMBO
                         Careful with those, now, those are 
                         dangerous.

               Everybody holds a Tijuana Bottle Rocket. Jimbo takes out a 
               lighter and lights the ends.

                                     JIMBO
                         Point 'em away from your eyes, now.

                                     KYLE
                         Wow! These are HUGE!

               As the fuses burn, Jimbo walks over to Ned and puts one arm 
               around him.

                                     JIMBO
                         Aw, look at them Ned. Look how much 
                         happiness a little firepower can 
                         bring to a child...

               Suddenly, the bottle rockets all FLY OUT!! Into the SKY!!

               BLAM!!!! The rockets explode on the snake, blasting it into 
               flakes of ash.

               The ash falls all around the base of the snake and puts out 
               the fire!!

                                     STAN
                         HEY, LOOK! WE BLEW UP THE SNAKE!!

               Suddenly, a small crowd of townspeople gather around.

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         All the ash from the snake is putting 
                         the flame out!

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, how do you like that? Bottle 
                         rockets SAVED the Fourth of July!

                         it to the deep end. I did it!!! I 
                         did it!!! I made it to the deep end.

                         open.

               A hand reaches in and yanks off the sign. The first graders 
               all jump into the empty pool and it turns yellow with their 
               pee.

                                     CARTMAN

               EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

               The black ash continues to fall all around. Everything is 
               slowly turning black.

               the sky.

                         what the hell!

               All the children in the area cheer.

               Within seconds it becomes a festive, wintery scene. As 
               Christmas music plays, the kids all play in the black "snow" 
               having snowball fights, building snowmen and making snow 
               angles.

               Just then Mr. Garrison appears. He has a new, strange puppet 
               attached to his hand. It's just a stick with a shirt on it.

                                     MR. GARRISON

               Mr. Garrison holds up a twig with a purple shirt on that has 
               a pink triangle on in.

               EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

               Chef's car pulls up from over the hill. Chef gets out of his 
               car and looks around. He can't believe what he's seeing.

               From Chef's POV, we see the all black town of South Park. 
               Kids are still playing in the black ash as if it was snow.

               Chef looks over and sees the boys building a black snow man. 
               They are absolutely black themselves. In fact, their faces 
               look like they're in black-face.

                                     CHEF

               Chef looks to his left and sees a group of townspeople, also 
               all in blackface, cleaning up the streets.

               Chef's jaw is dropped wide open.
