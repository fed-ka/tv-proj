      Breanne slides the flimsy metal door shut, fumbling with the 
      tiny lock while, behind her, Billy grabs at her shirt.

                                  BILLY
                    He s gonna  get in--he s gonna  get 
                    inside--

                    Shut up--shut up.

      Breathless, she pulls him back and away from the door. They 
      hear FOOTSTEPS. Low, animal breaths.

      Breanne holds her hand over her brother s mouth, trying to 
      keep him quiet while listening to Boyd circle the shed.

      Their heads turn at CLAWS ticking against the metal walls. 
      They follow the sounds down to where MOONLIGHT spills in 
      through the rusted and bent space between the shed s side and 
      floor. 

      CLAWS slip in through the space, feeling about for a hold.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/133.

      Backing further away, Breanne and Billy watch helplessly as 
      the claws grasp around the wall and begin to pull at it.

      METAL TEARS as Boyd wrenches the wall up, separating the 
      entire exterior of the shed from its floor. With a furious 
      GROWL, he hurls the collapsing steel frame into the air, 
      exposing the two SCREAMING children.

      But just as Boyd takes a step forward to attack, SOMETHING 
      ROLLS RIGHT IN FRONT HIS FEET.

      Breanne s JAR. 

      Lid removed, the FIREFLIES soar out of the opening, bursting 
      up in a cloud around Boyd s head. Enraged, he waves his claws 
      at the flickering lights.

      When the fireflies finally scatter, Boyd focuses his yellow 
      eyes forward to see the two children--are gone.


      Pushing aside her homework, Lydia gets up from bed to shake 
      off the nightmare. When her feet hit the floor, though, she 
      puts a hand to her head with a pained GASP.

      At her dresser, she finds the bottle for the IBUPROFEN empty.

      Grabbing a jacket, she pauses to notice the FULL MOON outside 
      the window. With a sigh, she shakes her head at herself.

      Engine off, Allison sits in the darkened car, hands gripping 
      the wheel. She stares out the windshield, gazing not at the 
      landscape in front of her, but at a memory--


      Still clutching the bloody wounds on his chest, Scott can t 
      seem to look Allison in the eyes.

                                    ALLISON
                    She tried to kill you?

                    How is that anywhere close to being

                                  SCOTT
                    I mean it doesn t matter now.

                      I couldn t. All I saw was it making

                    last memory of her... I couldn t do 
                    it...

      He trails off, looking past her. She turns to see Derek 
      standing behind them. Erica s body held in his arms.


      Allison blinks away the memory, trying to shake it off. Her 
      gaze drifts to the GLOVE COMPARTMENT. After a moment, she 
      reaches over and clicks it open to grab something inside.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/138.

      Slowly, she raises a small object between her fingers, 
      moonlight catching its razor-sharp edges... an ARROWHEAD.


      AN ELECTRIC CANDLE clicks on inside a tent. One-by-one, over 
      a dozen light up, an amber glow flickering around a young 
      woman named CAITLIN. She looks out the open tent flap.

                                    CAITLIN
                    You coming?

                                  EMILY (O.S.)
                    There s a snake out here the size 
                    of a train.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Kick it.

                                  EMILY (O.S.)
                    If I kick it, I swear it could 
                    swallow my foot and drag me back to 
                    Mordor.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Just step over it.

      Caitlin hears a shuffle of feet and then EMILY bursts through 
      the flap of the tent, scrambling inside. They both laugh as 
      she falls back into Caitlin s arms. Then Emily notices the 
      candles.

                                  EMILY
                    Nice touch.

      Caitlin threads her fingers through Emily s. Then slowly  
      lowers her lips to Emily s for a gentle kiss.

                                    CAITLIN
                    You re nervous.

                                  EMILY
                    You make me nervous.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Is that good or bad?

                                  EMILY
                    All good.

      She brushes Caitlin s hair from her cheek, a thumb against 
      her soft skin. Caitlin leans forward to kiss her again, but 
      Emily sits up.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/139.

                    Okay, that s a mood killer.

      She nods to the silhouette of a large BEETLE crawling up the 
      outside of the tent, a Pine Sawyer at almost two inches long.

      Caitlin thumps her hand against the beetle. The silhouette 
      disappears. But another beetle begins crawling up. Caitlin 
      thumps that one as well.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Okay?

                                  EMILY
                    Better.

      They kiss. More intense this time, bodies pressing closer. 
      Emily s nervousness subsides as she lets Caitlin kiss her 
      chin, her neck and--

      SHE SCREAMS.

      Caitlin lurches back in shock. Then glances up to see what 
      Emily s looking at. HUNDREDS of BEETLES crawling over the 
      tent, dark silhouettes pressing down on it.

      One BEETLE pushes in through a hole in the tent. Others pour 
      in after it, a dozen of them inside the tent.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)

                    Sorry. Bad timing. I ll ask later.

                    Or never. I m good with never.


      Derek and Isaac watch Scott get into the passenger side of 
      Argent s SUV. They share a look, both equally confused.

      When the SUV pulls out of its parking space, Derek starts the 
      engine to do the only thing he can. He follows them.*


      Scott shifts nervously in his seat while Argent drives.

                                  SCOTT
                    Thanks again. I ve been running for

                    Just a little further up. A little 
                    closer if you can.

      Letting the vehicle drift forward, Argent now sees what Scott 
      wants him to see...

      The POLICE CRIME SCENE where two devastated PARENTS identify 
      the body of their eighteen year-old son. 

      When the MEDICAL EXAMINER zips up the body bag, the MOTHER S 
      legs give out. The FATHER grabs her, trying to keep her on 
      her feet as she collapses under the weight of grief.

      Argent watches the scene, barely breathing.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Thanks again for the ride.

                    Where s the last place you saw 
                    them?


      Stepping toward the edge of the cliffside, Argent and the

                      difference to recognize. Wolves 
                    hunt for food. At a certain point 
                    they get full. Boyd and Cora are 
                    hunting for the pleasure of the

      spike into the ground. At its tip a soft light FLASHES on and

                    These are Ultrasonic Emitters. It s

      are off and running.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1326.

                      expression is getting on my nerves.

                    Stiles, look. This kid was hit in 
                    the back of the head. Hard enough

      The HOWL echoes its way inside, sending Derek into his 
      position just beyond the lobby of the school where the 
      corridors intersect.


      Hands opening to reveal his claws unsheathed, Derek stands 
      ready, poised to defend his ground.

      Through the open doors, he sees the two werewolves turning 
      away from Argent s SUV. Coming fast and right for him. But 
      just as they reach the steps--

      Both Cora and Boyd veer off to the sides, disappearing out of 
      his sight.

      Still blinking furiously, Boyd and Cora stagger into the 
      darkened corridor where--

      Derek grabs Cora. He shoves her back with brutal force, 
      sending the snarling werewolf tumbling across the tile floor.

      Boyd whirls to attack but Argent moves in, brandishing the 
      STUN BATON. BOLTS of ELECTRICITY ripple up the side with a 
      threatening CRACKLE.

      Boyd lashes out, but Argent whips the baton around like a 
      trained swordsman. He presses forward, turning the furious 
      werewolf around to face Scott who surges out of the darkness 
      with fangs bared.

      Derek holds his hands out, gesturing for Boyd and Cora to 
      approach. Scott inches over to Derek to help.

      Back on his feet and almost shaking with rage, Boyd steps to 
      Cora s side. Fangs bared, the two of them slowly approach.

      TWO FIRE EXTINGUISHERS blast WHITE FUMES at them. 

      Hands rising to shield their faces, Boyd and Cora howl in 
      response. But Derek and Scott use the extinguishers to force 
      them back, pushing them all the way into the Boiler Room. 

      Dropping the extinguisher, Scott SLAMS the DOOR shut as Derek 
      shoves a steel desk in front of it. They turn to each other, 
      breathless.

      A FRENETIC POUNDING jolts them back. From the other side, 
      Boyd and Cora hammer on the door uselessly. 

      After a moment, the pounding ceases.

      Under the ominous silence, Derek and Scott lean closer to 
      listen. They glance to each other, both of them noticing the 
      odd quiet. Cautiously, Scott presses his ear to the surface 
      of the door.

                    I have three roommates. Not exactly

                    How long have you two been 
                    together?

                                  STILES
                    You wanted to make it romantic?

                                    CAITLIN
                    Yeah, you know. Because...

                                  STILES
                    Because it was her first time.

      Eyes tearing up, Caitlin nods. Melissa looks to Stiles, 
      surprised by his intuitive response.

                                    CAITLIN
                    They re going to find her, right? 
                    Aren t they?

      She glances to both of them. But neither Stiles or Melissa 
      have an answer.


      Derek shoves the desk aside and reaches to open the door. 
      Scott grabs him, trying to stop him.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1339.

                    What are you doing?

                                  DEREK
                    Shut the door behind me. Keep it 
                    shut.

                                  SCOTT
                    You go in there alone and you re 
                    either going to kill them or 
                    they re going to kill you.

                                  DEREK
                    That s why I m going alone.

      He yanks the door open as--


      Ms. Blake slowly pushes the storage room door open to look 
      out. Past an array of pipes, air handlers and water pumps, 
      she sees something that takes the breath out of her...

      Two feral looking teenagers with glowing eyes and shockingly 
      large teeth, approaching her with murder in their eyes.

      As Blake draws in a breath for a terrified scream--

      Derek drags Boyd and Cora to the ground. Bodies rolling 
      across the floor, the attack is sudden and vicious.

      Blake YANKS the door closed and stumbles back in the closet.


      Scott leans against the boiler room door, listening to the 
      CRASHING, the CRIES of pain, a veritable symphony of 
      destruction happening inside.


      Down a corridor, Argent steps out of the shadows as the 
      GROWLS and SNARLS echo up from the basement.


      Inside, Derek desperately tries to fight off Cora and Boyd 
      without actually fighting them.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1340.

      And then, finally, he stops fighting.

      Arms outstretched, hands wrapped around their necks, Derek 
      holds off Boyd and Cora even as they slash at his body, 
      forcing him to his knees while he struggles to outlast, 
      trying simply to endure...

      Blood flying from every claw slash, their savage attack only 
        intensifies. Gritting his teeth, Derek closes his eyes.

      And endures.


      Now inside the school, Isaac spots the tiniest sliver of dawn 
      beginning to spill through the windows.

                                  ISAAC
                    Scott! Scott!


      Isaac races down the stairs to find Scott already pulling the 
      boiler room door open. They both stop in shock when they see 
      the bloody mess inside.

      Breathing hard--but still breathing--a brutally beaten Derek 
      slowly raises his eyes. 

      Cora and Boyd lie before him. Both alive and transformed back 
      to their human selves.

                                  DEREK
                          (with difficulty)
                      There s... a teacher... back there. 
                    I ll take care of her.

      Rising, he falters. Scott starts forward to catch him, but 
      Derek steadies on his own.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Get these two out of here.
                          (off their hesitation)
                    Go.

      Scott and Isaac hurry over to pick Cora and Boyd up while 
      Derek turns to the closed door of the storage closet.


      Cowering in the corner, an utterly terrified Ms. Blake tenses 
      as the door CLICKS OPEN. She grabs for something to defend 
      herself. Finds a stapler.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1341.

      Derek steps inside. With the light streaming in about him, he 
      looks like a Greek God come down from Olympus to save her.

      The stapler slips from Blake s grasp as he gently extends a 
      hand to help her up.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      In the dimly lit morgue, an exhausted Scott and Stiles look 
      over the body of Heather in front of them.

                                  SCOTT
                    So Boyd and Cora might not have 
                    killed anyone?

                                  STILES
                    You re going to wish they did.

                    Why?

                    I m not totally sure yet, but that 
                    other girl who was out in the 
                    woods, Emily? They re eventually 
                    going to find her...


      Stiles covers Heather s body and looks up to Scott.

                    It s called the Threefold Death.

                    So if they re not random killings, 
                    what are they?
