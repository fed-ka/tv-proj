      In a stunned daze, Scott stares out to the now empty road in *
      front of the school. Having just said goodbye to Allison. *
      Having recognized her father as the leader of the hunters. 
      And having realized his entire life is now an unmitigated 
      disaster.


      Players slam into each other during practice.*                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/113.

      Coach Finstock tosses the ball to the first player, a kid *
      named GREENBERG. But Jackson is on him in seconds, smashing 
      his stick down on the poor kid s gloves, sending the ball 
      flying out of the pocket.

                                  COACH
                    Nicely done, Jackson. Greenberg, 
                    that was a pathetic display of 
                    amateur ability. Do a lap.                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/114.

      As Greenberg takes off into a run, the next Player charges. A 
      moment later he lands on the ground with a sickening THUD.

      Scott, gazing off with far too many thoughts swirling in his 
      head, doesn t notice the other players backing up behind him.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    McCall, let s go!

      He snaps to attention, realizing he s at the head of the 
      line. Coach tosses the ball. Scott goes for the shot. But 
      Jackson comes at him with a volley of SLAP CHECKS.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Watch the slashing, Jackson!

      As the ball is knocked out of his grasp, Scott winces in 
      pain. He cradles his forearm where Jackson s stick came down 
      especially hard between glove and elbow pad.

                                    JACKSON
                    Still want to be first line, 
                    McCall?

      Gritting his teeth in anger, Scott looks up to reveal his 
      brown eyes are rapidly brightening to YELLOW.

                                  COACH
                    McCall, my grandmother can move 
                    faster than that and she s dead! 
                    Can you move faster than the 
                    lifeless corpse of my dead 
                      grandmother, McCall?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yes, Coach!

                                  COACH
                    Then do it again!

      The WHISTLE BLOWS and Scott shoots forward again as Coach 
      tosses the ball to him.

      Stiles steps away from the rest of the team, noticing the 
      change in Scott. His speed, the extraordinary agility with 
      which he moves.

      An oblivious Jackson goes for a CROSS CHECK, heading for 
      Scott with his stick horizontal even as the smaller boy 
      hurtles toward him with ferocious speed.

      They COLLIDE like two goats locking horns. Both go down,

      The sickening SOUND of bone dislodging from socket sends a 
      cringe through Coach. 

      While everyone else runs over to check on Jackson, Stiles 
      hurries to Scott s side.

                                  STILES
                    Are you okay?

      But Scott won t lift his head, won t reveal his face to 
      Stiles underneath the helmet.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Scott?

      His head tilts up to reveal the sharpened teeth jutting out 
      from his lower jaw.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s happening. I can t control it. 
                    It s happening.

      Grabbing him by the shoulder pads, Stiles pulls him up.

                                  STILES
                    Come on. Before anyone sees. Come, 
                    on, come on!

      As Stiles drags him off the field and toward the lockers, 
      neither of them notice someone watching from the sidelines...

      Derek Hale.


      On his bike and pedaling at top speed, Scott charges down the 
      road. Finally, he whips onto a driveway leading to the 
      rundown Hale house.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek!

      He lets his bike clatter to the ground, school bag with it. 
      In a flash he s on the porch, looking in each window. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Derek!

      Still no response. Scott slips around the side of the house 
      and to the back. Then something catches his attention--

      At the edge of the woods, he sees FRESH DIRT covering the 
      ground. As if something had been dug up. Or buried.

      But before he can approach, a sound stops him in his 
      tracks... A HEARTBEAT. At first it s a tiny rhythm in the 
      distance. But then it rapidly gets louder, stronger. Scott 
      starts to back away, moving for the front of the house again 
      and for his bike when--

      Derek steps out of the woods. No sudden appearance, no 
      theatrics. He just calmly walks out of the shadows.

      Scott tries to stand strong.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Stay away from her. She doesn t 
                    know anything.

                                  DEREK
                    What if she does?

      Derek keeps coming, backing Scott away from the house.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1120.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    You think your little buddy Stiles 
                    can Google werewolves and now 
                    you ve got all the answers?

      Reaching down to Scott s school bag, Derek picks up the 
      LACROSSE STICK, playfully turning it over in his hands.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    You don t get it yet, but I m 
                    looking out for you. Think about 
                    what could happen. You re on the 
                    field. The aggression takes over. 
                    And you shift in front of everyone. 
                    Allison, your mother, your 
                      friends...

      Derek s hand comes up and the CLAWS are out. Scott flinches 
      back, both in fear and surprise at his display of mastery 
      over his abilities.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    And when they see you--

      He rakes his claws over the net.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                      Everything falls apart.

      The slashed threads flutter away from the head of the 
      lacrosse stick, the net now in tatters. Derek tosses the 
      ruined stick. Scott catches it. When he looks up--

      He s alone, Derek having vanished yet again.


      Derek s black Dodge Challenger roars out from the long 
      driveway leading to the dilapidated house. In its wake, 
      Stile s Jeep slowly pulls forward.


      Now carrying a shovel and pick, Scott and Stiles head for the 
      house. But Scott pauses, glancing around.

                                  SCOTT
                      Something s different.

                                  STILES
                    Different how?                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1127.

      But Scott shakes his head. He looks back to the road, 
      listening for any sounds.

                                  SCOTT
                    Let s get this over with.

      Unnerved now as well, Stiles follows him around the house to 
      the edge of the woods. Waving him over, Scott kicks at the 
      dirt on the ground. It s loose, gravelly.

      They start digging. Piles of dirt landing on the grass 
      nearby. They work fast, Scott pulling up his sleeves as sweat 
      starts to drip down his forehead.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    This is taking too long.

                                  STILES
                    Just keep going.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if he comes back?

                                  STILES
                    Then we get the hell out of here.

                                  SCOTT
                    What if he catches us?

                                  STILES
                    I have a plan for that.

                                  SCOTT
                    Which is?

                                  STILES
                    You run one way. I run the other. 
                    Whoever he catches first? Too bad.

                                  SCOTT
                    I hate that plan.

      They dig faster, harder. Muscles burning, Scott keeps 
      throwing nervous glances to the driveway.

                                  STILES
                    Stop, stop, stop!

      Dropping the shovel, Stiles clambers down into the hole. He 
      feels around and finds a dark FABRIC in the dirt. Both of 
      them now digging with their hands they finally uncover--                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1128.

      A BLACK BAG, DRAWSTRING tied in tight knots. Stiles digs at 
      the knot with his fingers.

                                  SCOTT
                    Hurry.

                                  STILES
                    I m trying. Did he have to tie the 
                    thing in nine hundred knots?

                                  SCOTT
                    I ll do it.

      Both of them claw at the drawstring, almost frantically 
      trying to get the knot to come undone. And then finally it 
      loosens. The black bag flutters open to reveal the body 
      inside--

      Except it s not a dead girl. It s the body of a WOLF. Stiles 
      and Scott both HOLLER, jumping back.

                                  STILES
                    What the hell is that?

                                  SCOTT
                    It s a wolf.

                                  STILES
                    I can see that. I thought you said 
                    you smelled blood? As in human 
                    blood?

                                  SCOTT
                    I told you something was different.

      Scott pulls back the edge of the bag to get a better look. 
      The remains of the wolf peer through, a tangle of legs and 
      blood-crusted fur.

                                  STILES

                    Help me cover this up.

      Stiles reaches for the shovel when he notices A PURPLE FLOWER 
      in the ground. It sticks out of the dirt as if it had only 
      recently been planted there.

                                  SCOTT
                    What s wrong?

                                  STILES

                                  STILES
                    I think it s Wolfsbane.

                    You are so unprepared for this.

      Stiles kneels next to the flower, gently feeling around the 
      stem. He pulls it up, revealing that the flower has sprouted 
      out of what appears to be a very thin but strong twine 
      interlaced from its stem and root.

                                  SCOTT

      While Scott takes several cautious steps back, Stiles 
      continues unearthing the purple-flowered rope. Soil falling 
      around his shoes, he walks in circles around the grave.

      LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE - As Stiles continues, the Wolfsbane 
      rope leads back to the grave in an almost perfect spiral.

      Finally, at about ten yards out, Stiles reaches the end of 
      the rope. With a pile gathered into his arms, he turns to 
      Scott who is staring back at the grave.

      FADE IN:


      Morning. The Hale property is now a crime scene. Handcuffed, 
      Derek is led into a police car by a Deputy while Scott looks 
      on by Stiles s jeep.

      Scott quickly types a TEXT into his phone: Ok, go.


      Stiles is yanked out of the car by the back of his jacket. 
      Sheriff Stilinski drags him over to Scott.

                      Absolutely.


      The Jeep skids to a halt. Stiles jumps out with his school 
      bag and tosses it as far as he can into the woods.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1134.

                    Okay, okay, it s gone.

      But when he turns back to the Jeep, Scott s door is also 
      open. The passenger seat empty. Stiles stands very still. 
      Listening to the silence around him.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Scott?

      He snaps his head around when he hears MOVEMENT. Now very 
      aware of his shortened breath, Stiles tries to peer around 
      the corner of his Jeep. But then he sees--

      THROUGH THE JEEP S WINDOWS - Scott on the other side. His 
      body a silhouette except for his EYES. Yellow and bright 
      through the dirty windows.

      Slowly, but purposefully, Scott moves left. Stiles takes a 
      step right, trying to keep the Jeep between them.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Don t do this, Scott.

      Another step left. Stiles moves again. Scott angrily slams 
      his hands into the Jeep. It ROCKS toward Stiles, tipping up.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Scott!

      He hits the Jeep again and again to the point where it almost 
      seems like it s going to flip right over and crush Stiles.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Stop!

      Clawed hands latching onto the side of the Jeep, Scott 
      himself launches up and--

      ONTO THE ROOF.

      Stiles stumbles back, falling onto his butt. He gazes up, now 
      seeing his friend for the first time as a complete werewolf. 
      And it scares the hell out of him.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1135.

      Arms outstretched, Scott lets loose an ANGUISHED ROAR, 
      howling up at the sky.

      Stiles twists forward across the pavement and scrambles back 
      into the Jeep through the passenger side. He knocks the gear 
      shift into DRIVE and manages to get a foot on the GAS PEDAL.

      As Scott s footsteps pound across the roof, Stiles FLOORS IT. 
      Spinning around to look out the window, he sees--

      THE SILHOUETTE OF SCOTT landing in the middle of the road. 

      Stiles hits the BRAKES, skidding to a halt at a safe 
      distance. When he looks back again--

      A shadow disappears into the woods, Scott racing for the 
      cover of darkness.

      FADE IN:


      Through the open second-floor bedroom window, Allison can be 
      seen sitting down at her desk with an open box. She pulls out 
      a simple UNFRAMED PHOTO, looking at the words on the back:

      Philly Girls 4eva. We ll miss you!

      She turns the photo back around, smiling at the picture of 
      her with her friends from her last home. Then she slips it 
      into the corner of her mirror while never noticing--

      THE FIGURE perched in the tree just a few feet from her 
      window... Scott, still a werewolf.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1137.

      In the shadows under the setting sun, his breathing becomes 
      more hollow and ragged as Allison comes to the window.

      Scott moves forward, creeping out of the darkness as if in 
      another second he could leap into her room and--

      Allison pulls the window shut, the glass revealing a sudden 
      REFLECTION to Scott.

      Himself. The face of a monster staring back at him. 

      Scott retreats back into the shadows, frightened by his own 
      appearance. He jumps down from his perch on the tree, darting 
      away from the house and into the street just as--

      HEADLIGHTS appear. A car SCREECHES to a halt. Scott SLAMS 
      into the hood, rolling over it and toppling to the pavement. 
      Argent hops out of the driver s side.

                                  ARGENT
                    Oh my God...

      He has his phone out, already dialing 9-1-1 as he crouches 
      over Scott. But the boy s hand comes up, gripping the man s 
      arm. When Argent looks down at him, he's back to normal.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m okay.

                    Dad? What the hell are you doing?

      Allison comes rushing out the front door to Scott.

                                  ARGENT
                    He came out of nowhere--

                    Are you trying to kill him?

      Scott glances up at the ironic question.

                                  ARGENT
                    Of course not. He ran out into the 
                    street--

      She kneels over him, tenderly brushing dirt from the road off 
      his brow. Argent looks on, a different kind of concern on his 
      face now as Scott and Allison gaze into each other s eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m fine. I swear.
                          (to Argent)
                    I m sorry I hit your car. I was 
                    just coming to say hi.

      Allison helps him to his feet.

                                  ARGENT
                    You re sure you re okay?

                    Of course, I m coming.

      Her hands linger on him as Argent peers in between them.

                                  ARGENT
                    We both are.

      Scott and Allison turn to him, each with a look of surprise. 
      This is news to both of them. And neither seems to like it.

      Scott walks out onto the field, Stiles following. With an 
      anxious breath, he turns to--

      THE BLEACHERS - where Melissa McCall stands up waving. She 
      made it. Then Allison and her father, Mr. Argent, appear, 
      walking up to find a good seat.

      charging off the bench and on to the field. 

      Stiles remains with the other bench warmers, nervously 
      chewing the fingers of his gloves.

      ON THE LACROSSE FIELD - Scott walks out to take his position. 
      He pulls his helmet down and briefly closes his eyes.

                    Please, let this go okay.

      Glaring at him from underneath his own helmet, Jackson walks 
      confidently on to the field. Then turns his back to Scott.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1144.

                    Action? Definite possibility.

      ON THE FIELD - Jackson moves to face the opposing team member 
      at the draw. The Ref places the ball on the grass. Sound 
      drops out around Scott. Just his uneasy breath and his always 
      POUNDING HEART.

                                  SCOTT
                    Please... please...

      The Ref slowly brings the whistle to his lips. Jackson 
      tightens his grip on his stick, teeth clenched down on his 
      mouth guard as--

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS.

      Jackson scoops up the ball before the opposing player even 
      has a chance to blink. 

      Scott moves fast, darting around the others, getting open for 
      a pass as quickly as he can but--

      Jackson tosses the ball to another teammate. 

      SLAP CHECKS come down hard on Beacon Hills and the ball rolls 
      across the grass, loose for anyone to grab.

      Scott hurries forward to take it, but Jackson is there first. 
      It s almost like he s stealing the ball from Scott.

      Whipping his stick around, Jackson hurls a shot toward the 
      opposing goal. The ball hits the net.

      The crowd on the bleachers CHEERS, shouts for Jackson 
      erupting among them.

                    This is not going to be good.

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS AGAIN - But as fast as Scott moves, the 
      ball never seems to find its way into his pocket. He keeps 
      trying, one play after another.

      FROM THE BLEACHERS - The disappointment on Melissa McCall s 
      face comes like a punctuation mark to every missed pass, 
      every missed opportunity.

      But then as Scott adjusts his helmet, he hears something, 
      VOICES coming into his head. Jackson talks to DANNY, the 
      goalie.

                                    JACKSON

                    But what if he s open?

      Scott holds still, head cocked while finally hearing what 
      Jackson has been whispering to the other players.

      Scott. Standing with his gloves twisting around the stick, he 
      looks like he s about to snap it into little pieces.

      At the start of the next quarter, the Ref comes walking past

      Scott s body seems to rise with each breath, as if he s about

      Unnerved, the other players take tentative steps back.

      Lydia pulls up the sign again and flips it over.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Allison? Little help here?

      She reluctantly helps Lydia hold up the sign. The backside 
      reads: JACKSON IS #1!!

      Head turned to the stands, Scott sees it. And that does it. 
      He breathes a furious SNARL between his teeth as--A CRACK 
      snakes its way up the side of his helmet.

                                    JACKSON
                    What the hell we waiting for?

      The Ref blows the WHISTLE. The sound tears across the field, 
      going off like a FIRE ALARM in Scott s head.

      Jackson and the Opposing Player grapple for the BALL, sending 
      it flying up into the air where--

      Scott leaps up, snatching it with uncanny precision. The 
      crowd issues a WHOA in response as he lands and charges back 
      down the field right past--

      Jackson, whose uniform billows up in Scott s wake.

      With a sudden WOOSH, the ball goes flying. Right past the 
      goalie and into the net.

      ON THE BLEACHERS - both Melissa and Allison jump up, 
      HOLLERING. Lydia is knocked in the shoulder. Only mildly, but 
      her look is one of pure annoyance.

      ON THE SIDELINES - Stiles follows Coach, clutching one of his 
      gloves in his hand, chewing the index finger.

      A furious Jackson turns to his teammates. One of them shrugs, 
      pointing to the scoreboard. Beacon is down by one now, a mere 
      minute left on the clock.

                                  REF
                    Set!

      SCOTT S POV - shaky, wavering. Like that of a killer. The 
      other team takes a few frightened steps back as if sensing 
      they're on the field with something very, very dangerous.

      The WHISTLE BLOWS and Scott's off again.

      He moves for the ball but it s captured by the other team. 
      Scott goes for a slap check. The opposing player is so 
      freaked out he just tosses the ball to Scott.

                                  COACH
                    Did the opposing team just 
                      deliberately pass the ball to us?

                                  STILES
                    I believe so, Coach.

                                  COACH
                      Interesting. Helpful, but 
                      interesting.

      Charging past the other players like a lightning bolt, Scott 
      FIRES ON THE NET. The Goalie twists, lacrosse stick coming up 
      to make the catch. But--

      THE BALL TEARS RIGHT THROUGH THE POCKET OF HIS STICK.

      Fans in the bleachers CHEER as the ball hits the net. The 
      Goalie lowers his stick to see the busted pocket.

      Scott backs away as both Coaches surround the REF, shouting 
      and arguing with TWENTY SECONDS left on the clock.

                                  REF
                    Goal!

      The Beacon Hills crowd cheers, the game now tied. While the 
      opposing team changes up goalie sticks, Jackson looks back to 
      Scott who keeps his head down.

      CLOSE ON - Scott breathing hard, mouth full of fangs, eyes 
      yellow. Trying desperately not to let anyone see him.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1150.

                    Set!

      Jackson reluctantly takes his position for the draw.

                                  OPPOSING PLAYER
                    What the hell s up with your 
                    teammate, dude? What s he on?

                                    JACKSON
                    I don t know. Yet.

      THE WHISTLE blows and both Jackson and the Opposing Player go 
      for the ball which tumbles out of their grasp. Jackson SLAPS 
      down trying to grab it.

      The ball spins into the air as--

      Scott WHIPS past, grabbing it right in the middle of its 
      flight again. He charges for the goal and something happens--

      His eyes BURN brighter, yellow tint turning to a YELLOW GLOW, 
      the pure animal taking over. With the other players closing 
      in on him, he falters, as if not knowing where to go.

                                  STILES
                    Scott, no...

      And for a moment it s almost as if Scott is no longer 
      charging at the goal, but charging toward the closest player, 
      charging toward prey. 

      Until out of the chaos of sound, one VOICE comes through--

                                    ALLISON
                    Come on, Scott. You can do it.

      He blinks, the glow in his eyes simmering back down, 
      Allison s voice pulling him from the brink of animal fury.

      Then, as the opposing team advances, Scott shoots on the 
      goal. And despite the Goalie s desperate dive--

      THE BALL HITS THE NET.

      CHEERING THUNDERS around him. Breathing hard, Scott takes a 
      few steps back.                         TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1151.

      CONTINUED:3232

      Everyone is coming toward him, people jumping off the bench 
      to congratulate him. His mother, Allison and Lydia stepping 
      down as well. And worst of all... Argent. 

      Retreating back, Scott yanks one of his gloves off to reveal 
      the CLAWS at the tips of his fingers.

                                  SCOTT
                    No, no...

      Allison hurries onto the field. All she can see is a swarm of 
      lacrosse players in the same uniform. They each pull their 
      helmets off but none of them is Scott.

      Stiles collapses onto the bench, still a nervous wreck. 
      Behind him, his Dad gets off his cell phone. Stiles notices.

                                  STILES
                    Dad? What s wrong?


      Alone on the field, and still fuming, Jackson s eyes focus on 
      something left in the grass...

      Scott s LACROSSE GLOVE.

      Slowly, he picks it up, noticing odd tears at the fingertips. 
      They re perforations. Like holes were poked through with 
      something sharp and jagged.

      Jackson turns to find someone watching him from the 
        sidelines...

      Derek.

      With a strange smile, he gives the mystified boy a nod as if 
      to say hello. And then Derek turns, walking away from the 
      field, striding right into camera--

      INTO BLACK.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
