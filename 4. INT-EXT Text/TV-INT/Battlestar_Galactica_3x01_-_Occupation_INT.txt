  Tigh jumps slightly as the door to the cell OPENS and BROTHER 
  CAVIL ENTERS, carrying a small chair with him.  He sets the 
  chair down in the middle of the cell and regards Tigh evenly.

                                BROTHER CAVIL 
                You know... every time you leave 
                the cell... we change the hashmarks 
                on your little  calendar  over 
                  there... 

    Tigh s one eye can t help glancing over at the hashmarks he s 
    laboriously scratched on the wall.

                                BROTHER CAVIL (cont d)
                  Guess how long you ve really been 
                  here.

  Tigh doesn t respond.  In fact, he s taken non-communication 
  to a fine art throughout the course of his incarceration, and 
    Cavil s used to it by now.


    D Anna ENTERS the darkened space, lit by guttering CANDLES 
  and filled with INCENSE.  Lying on a cot at the end of the 
  tent, raised slightly as if on an altar, is an old woman -- 
    SELLOI DODONA.  Her breathing is labored and shallow.

                                SELLOI
                  Don t be afraid.  I know who you 
                  are.  What you are.  Poor thing... 
                you must be terrified...

    D Anna hesitates, then moves toward the cot...


  The windows are shuttered, the sun STREAMING across the room 
    through the slats, painting Ellen s naked back with slashes 
  of light as she writhes on top of someone on the couch.  Her 
  voice is angry, charged:

                                ELLEN
                  Yes!  C mon!  Don t stop!  Frak me 
                you sonovabitch!  FRAK ME!


  Laura still scribbling away on her pad of paper.  Tory has a 
  small stack of CANDID SNAPSHOTS featuring a variety of 
    humans, each of which seems to have been taken quickly, most 
    blurry or poorly framed.

                                TORY
                  I think we can match names to 
                  about... fifty of these photos.  
                But our best guess puts the total 
                  police force at around... 200.

                  That s tough.  Cylons are afraid 
                the population will go after any 
                  human who joins the New Caprica 
                  Police.

                                LAURA
                As well they should...

  She writes furiously, with passion, flips over to the next 
    page...


  Kara sits at the dining table, a thick and juicy STEAK now on 
  the plate before her, but she makes no move to eat it, her 
    blood-shot eyes staring down at the food without seeing it.  
  Her hair is still long, but unkempt.  Dark circles emphasize 
  puffy eyelids and a haggard countenance.  Gods know when she 
  slept last.  

    LEOBEN ENTERS from the (unseen) kitchen, carrying more bowls 
  of food.

                                LEOBEN
                  Okay... mashed potatoes, gravy, and 
                  even some carrots.  

    Leoben fills her plate with food, then sits down.  He reaches 
  out to her and she puts her hand in his after beat.

  Cavil and Tigh.

                                BROTHER CAVIL 
                We reviewed your case today. 
                        (beat)
                  I can tell you, there was great 
                  disappointment on the review 
                  committee.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 6.

  Tigh says nothing.  Won t even look at him.  Cavil reaches 
  into a pocket and takes out a TOOTHBRUSH, a WASHCLOTH, and a 
  BAR of SOAP.

                                BROTHER CAVIL (cont d)
                  Brought you some things.  Might as 
                  well be comfortable as long as 
                  you re here, right?

  Tigh closes his eye, trying not to slide into hopelessness as 
  he realizes this means he s going to be here a long time.


    D Anna stands above the frail form of Selloi, not sure what 
  she should be doing here or even why she s come exactly.  
    Selloi isn t well.  

                                SELLOI
                Did you bring any candy?

                                D ANNA
                        (surprised)
                  Candy...?  No.  

  She grabs a VIAL, shakes out CHAMALLA LEAVES -- the raw form 
  of the drug that Laura once took -- and begins chewing them.

                                SELLOI
                  Chamalla s so... bitter.

                  Zeus sees all.  He sees you, Number 
                  Three... sees your pain.  Your 
                  destiny.  The gods all weep for 
                  you.

                                D ANNA
                  There is no Zeus.  No other gods 
                but God.

                                SELLOI
                You don t believe that anymore.  
                You don t know what to believe.  
                  That s why you re here.

                        (quick)
                  That s not true.  And I don t even

                        (shocked)

                  I have a message for you... from

                you through me... just as He speaks 
                in your dreams...


  Ellen and the man both climax with shuddering YELLS... then 
  she collapses on top of her lover.


  Laura is still writing.

                                LAURA
                  Someday Adama s coming back.  And 
                  when that happens, the story of what 
                  went on here has to be told.  Our 
                  children need to know some people 
                  fought back.  Some people did

    Leoben is eating with a hearty appetite.  Kara is not.

                        (small)
                  I need a knife.

    Leoben reaches over and begins to cut her steak for her.


  Ellen is putting on her shirt.  Her face a mask of self-
    loathing and tightly-controlled anger.  The MAN on the couch 
  is sitting up -- but we still can t see his face.

                                MAN (O.S.)
                  I quite enjoyed that.

                                ELLEN
                I m so glad.  And when do I get 
                  what I want?

  The Man moves into the light to pick up his pants and we see 
  for the first time that he s a Brother Cavil Cylon.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  I believe it s happening right now.


  Cavil stands up, goes to the door and KNOCKS, signalling his 
    imminent departure.  Tigh sits hunched against the wall, 
    struggling to fight off the hopelessness engulfing him.  The 
  door OPENS and Cavil looks down at Tigh with just the hint of 
    a smile.

                                BROTHER CAVIL
                  Let s go.  Processing will take a 
                few hours -- bureaucracy must be 
                  served.  But with a little luck you 
                  should be home by dinnertime.

  Tigh looks up in shock.  Is this a trick?

                                BROTHER CAVIL (cont d)
                  I won t hold the door open forever, 
                  Colonel.

  Tigh gets painfully to his feet, draws himself fully erect 
  and heads for the door.  He limps on his left side.      'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 9.




    Selloi and D Anna.

                                SELLOI
                The message is... the fruit borne 
                of two peoples is alive... the 
                  child named for the wife and sister 
                of the all-knowing Zeus.

                  Hera lives.  

    D Anna reacts in shock.

                  That s not true.  The child s dead.  

    Selloi stares at her for a beat, then closes her eyes again. 

                                SELLOI
                You will hold her in your arms... and 
                you will know at last what it is to 
                  feel true love... but you will lose all 
                  that you have done here... wish I 
                  had... chocolate caramels...

  But Selloi seems to have fallen asleep.  D Anna stands there, 
    uncertain what to do or think.   


  Laura and Tory react to the BOOMS that rattle the furniture.  
  They both rush to the windows.  Laura smiles tightly.


    D Anna hears the explosion too -- she moves to the window and 
  looks out to see the SMOKE rising above the city.  


    Leoben and Kara hear the last of the distant BOOMS fade away.  

                                LEOBEN 
                  Frakking insurgents.  
                        (finishes cutting steak)
                  There you go.

                                KARA
                  Thank you.

  She looks up at him and her expression softens just a little.  
  It catches Leoben short, he puts a hand to her face.

                                LEOBEN
                You look... so lovely tonight.

  She gives him a small smile -- and in an instant, Kara s 
  hands fly up from her lap with a homemade SHIV from where 
  she d hidden it and PLUNGES IT INTO HIS NECK.  Leoben gasps 
  and gurgles, clutching at her with his hands, but she spins 
  out of the chair and away from him as he crashes to the 
    floor, blood pouring out of his wound.  The look on Leoben s 
  face is more disappointed than angry.

                                LEOBEN (cont d)
                  I ll... see you... soon... Kara...

  Kara grabs the steak knife from his plate and leans over him.

                                KARA
                  Take your time.

  She stabs him viciously and repeatedly in the chest until his 
  body stops convulsing and he lies there dead.  Then she sits 
  down at the table and begins to eat with relish...

                                                                        FADE OUT.

  Not really interested in another round of who s afraid of 
    Virginia Woolf, Caprica Six gets up and starts getting 
    dressed.  Not that it deters Baltar in the slightest.

                is really the key to gaining the

                  thought, actually.

  The viciousness and contempt in his eyes are all too plain to 
  see.  She gathers up her remaining clothes and heads for the 
  door.   At the last second -- 

                                BALTAR (cont d)
                  Don t go.

  edge of the bed...

  Tyrol gives her a kiss, then grabs his jacket.  

                                TYROL
                  Back in three hours.

                                CALLY 
                One of these days you re just not 
                  going to come back are you?  You ll 
                  just vanish.  And that ll be it.  
                  We ll never see you again.  Nick 
                  will never know his father...

  Tyrol stops.  Cally is still looking down at Nick.

                                TYROL
                  I ll be back.  Couple hours, tops.

  Tyrol EXITS, and Cally watches her baby.


  Tigh shakes off the memory as he sits at a small table and 
    someone pours him a drink, which he takes gratefully.  REVEAL 
  Tyrol & Anders here with him.

                                TYROL 
                  Good to see you, Colonel.

                  They popped it right out onto the 
                  floor, picked it up and showed it 
                to me.  Looked like a hard-boiled 
                  egg.

  Tyrol and Anders exchange a look -- what do you say to that? 
  They start to mumble their Sorry, Colonels but Tigh takes 
    another drink, changes the subject.

    Leoben arrives at the door to the apartment, pauses just 
    before going inside.  He looks exhausted.  Presses his 
    forehead to the door for a beat... then rallies himself, 
    shakes off his fatigue and goes inside.


  Kara is sitting on the living room floor, nonchalantly 
    braiding a lock of her long hair -- the corpse of Leoben 
  lying where it fell, a short distance away.  Kara ignores the 
    Leoben who enters, continues to braid the lock of hair as he 
    crosses the room and sits in one of the dining room chairs, 
  his former body at his feet in a pool of dried blood.

                  That s why He wants us to be

  Kara suddenly looks to be on the verge of tears.

  Kara stops before she reaches him, then allows herself a 
  small smile before tossing the SHIV at his feet before moving 
  away.  He picks it up and examines it.

                                LEOBEN (cont d)

  Kara goes to a wall, presses her head against it -- 
    inadvertently echoing the same gesture Leoben made outside -- 
  she seems on the edge emotionally, physically, mentally.

    Leoben EXITS to the bedroom -- the instant he s gone, Kara 
  bolts for the door, yanks it open and is confronted with a 
  METAL CELL DOOR leading to a darkened hallway.  She throws 
    herself against the bars in crazed fury -- and not for the 
  first time.

                  Admiral, considering how long our 
                  pilots have been in the air, I 
                  suggest we recall the birds and 
                  scrub the training exercise.

                                                                        INTERCUT:


    Adama s fuse is short -- much shorter than we re used to, but 
  this has become par for the course at this point.

                        (builds)
                If we can t do this in a training 
                  scenario, then how the hell are we 
                  gonna pull this off with Cylon 
                  raiders on our asses?  Huh?  Tell 
                me!

                                LEE
                        (right back at him)
                  What the frak do you want from me?  
                  I don t know how the hell we re 
                  supposed to do any of this crap at 
                  half-strength!

                                KAT (WIRELESS)
                  Collision!  We ve had a collision 
                out here!


  On Galactica and Pegasus, Adama and Lee react with grim 
    frustration...


  Lee angrily confronting Adama, who refuses to even look at 
  him.

                                LEE
                  This whole thing is insane!  We ve 
                got two ships at half-strength -- 
                  crews that haven t seen action in 
                  almost a year and a half -- and 
                  you re acting like the only problem 
                is they aren t working hard enough!

                                ADAMA
                  Have you looked at yourself in the 
                  mirror lately?

                                LEE
                  Excuse me?

                                ADAMA
                You heard me.  You re soft.  Weak.  
                  Mentally.  Physically.  

                                LEE
                        (stung)
                  This isn t about me--

                                ADAMA
                  You ve had four months to get your 
                act together and so far you haven t 
                  done a frakking thing except whine 
                and complain about how hard it is.  
                  Well, guess what?  It s gonna get a 
                lot harder before it gets easier.  
                So turn around and march your fat 
                ass out that hatch, go back to your 
                  ship and get your men ready or I ll 
                  find someone who can.

  Adama turns away from him and starts going over some

  took something out of Adama as well...


    Anders and Laura are watching MAYA sitting and rocking BABY 
  ISIS somewhere in the recesses of the hideout.

                  Sam, I want you to really hear me 
                on this.  There s no one -- no one 
                  with a higher-value than Maya and 
                her baby.  They cannot fall into 
                  Cylon hands.

                                ANDERS
                  I get it.  How far you want me to

                If it looks like the Cylons are 
                  going to capture them...?

  The implication is clear -- and Laura looks at Maya and her 
  child as a chill goes through her heart.

                No.

  FADE IN:


    D Anna, TWO Brother Cavils, and TWO DORALS, Caprica Six, and 
    BOOMER are meeting with Baltar.  D Anna is distracted 
    throughout, her thoughts still back on her meeting with 
    Laura.  

                                BROTHER CAVIL #1
                  Let s review why we re here, shall 
                we?  We re supposed to bring the 
                  word of  God  to these people, 
                  right?  

                                BROTHER CAVIL #2
                To save humanity from damnation by 
                  bringing  His  love to these poor 
                  benighted people?

                                CAPRICA SIX
                  We re here because a majority of 
                the Cylon felt that the slaughter 
                of mankind had been a mistake.

                                BOOMER
                  We re here to find a new way to 
                  live in peace.  As God wants us to 
                  live.






















                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 34.

                                BROTHER CAVIL #2
                And it s been a fun ride so far. 
                But I m still trying to clarify our 
                  objectives.  Now, if we re here to 
                  spread  God s word  then it follows 
                  that we must employ any means 
                  necessary to do so -- any means. 

                                BROTHER CAVIL #1
                  Fear of the Lord is a key article 
                of faith as I understand it.  So 
                  perhaps it s time to instill more 
                  fear in people s hearts and minds.
                        (beat)
                  Let s execute Baltar.

                                BALTAR
                  WHAT!

                                CAPRICA SIX
                  That s not going to happen.

                                BROTHER CAVIL #2
                  Just because he s your favorite toy, 
                  that shouldn t be allowed to interfere 
                  with the larger issues involved.

                                BALTAR
                  I ve done nothing but try to help 
                you people and this is how I m--

                                CAPRICA SIX
                  Gaius is with me.
                        (beat)
                  Anyone who wants to challenge that 
                  will have to deal... with me.

  She lets that hang in the air for a beat.  No one -- not even 
  Cavil takes up that challenge.

                                DORAL #1
                  Doesn t matter.  If we d killed him 
                at the beginning, it might ve 
                  worked.

                                DORAL #2
                By now, most humans think of him as 
                  a traitor and would actually cheer 
                his death.

                                BALTAR
                  Hello?  I m sitting right here!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 35.

                  Fine.  Don t kill Baltar.  Round up 
                the suspected leaders of the 
                  insurgency and execute them.  
                  Publicly.  Then round up random 
                  groups off the streets.  Execute 
                  them.  Publicly.  

                                BROTHER CAVIL #2
                  Send a message that the gloves are 
                  coming off, that the insurgency 
                  stops now or we start reducing the 
                  human population to a more 
                  manageable size -- say, less than a 
                  thousand.

                We need to stop acting like 
                  butchers.

                                CAPRICA SIX
                The entire point of coming here was 
                to start a new way of life.  To 
                  push past the conflict that s 
                  separated us from humans for so 
                  long.

                                BROTHER CAVIL #1
                And what has it gotten us?  They re 
                not exactly welcoming us with -- 
                oh, why bother?

                  that.  Delusional machines.  What 
                  will the universe think of next?

  Cavil EXITS and the meeting breaks up with most of them 
    heading for the door.  D Anna stays where she is.

    Caprica Six is one of the last to go.

                                D ANNA 
                Is it worth it, Caprica?  Is the 
                  love of that man really worth 
                  possibly losing all this?

    Caprica Six looks at her for a long moment.

                                CAPRICA SIX
                If you ever experienced love... you 
                  wouldn t have to ask.

  She EXITS.


  Kara ENTERS the bathroom, closes the door behind her.  Turns 
  on the WATER in the SINK.  Then quietly takes the TOP off the 
    toilet, reaches down inside the toilet TANK and quietly 
    disassembles part of the mechanism, removing TWO PIECES OF 
    METAL.  She wedges one piece of metal into the door JAM, 
    effectively wedging it closed.  She then goes to the sink, 
  which is filling with water... looks up at her reflection in 
  the mirror for a long beat... then takes the other piece of 
  metal and begins to DIG into her wrist with the sharp tip.  
  She draws BLOOD... pulls back... struggles for a beat... 
    grimaces, tries to force herself to do it... starts cutting 
  her wrist again... but can t do it.

  Water begins to flow over the rim of the sink and onto the 
    floor.    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 37.




    Leoben is standing there, sees the water coming under the 
  door.

                                LEOBEN
                  Kara...

  She starts inside the bathroom.

                                LEOBEN (cont d)
                  I know what you re trying to do.
                        (beat)
                And I know you won t do it.

  Kara begins to crack.  She steps back from the basin, slides 
  down the wall and collapses on the watery floor.

                                LEOBEN (cont d)
                  Kara...?

  On the other side of the door, Leoben suddenly wonders if 
  maybe he s wrong.  He tries the door -- it doesn t budge, but 
  then he uses his strength to PUSH THE DOOR forward anyway and 
  the doorjamb itself SPLINTERS and BREAKS.  He looks in and 
  sees Kara in a heap on the floor -- her wrist bloodied, but 
    clearly alive.  Leoben kneels down next to her, takes her 
  face in his hand -- but her eyes are far away, all the fight 
  and all the life gone out of her.

  Lee is fuming as he unbuttons his jacket and tosses it on a 
    chair.  Dualla is on the couch, with a stack of paperwork 
    spread out in front of her.

                  That s one of the reasons I married

  Lee looks at her for a beat, stunned.  She goes back to doing 
    paperwork and he stands there in the middle of his quarters, 
    wondering just how the hell he got to this place...    'Occupation' - FULL COLLATED 5/11/06 39.

                on the ground.  Until we make 
                  contact with them, it s all just...

    REVEAL that we re in SHARON S CELL as she sits down across 
  from Adama in a chair.  The cell itself is far more 
    comfortable and homey than the last time we saw it.  
    Furniture, artwork, some books, drawings, photos of her and 
  Helo together -- the feeling of a lifer s cell who s been 
  given special privileges by the warden.  

    A quiet beat as they both sip their tea.

                                SHARON
                  Helo tells me you and Lee are... 
                  having problems.

  Adama takes a deep breath, thinks it over -- and we realize 
  that their relationship has changed over the last year.  
    There s an intimacy here, a trust that hasn t been there in a 
  long time.

                                ADAMA
                  Seems like... don t know my own son

                  A year s a long time.  

  Beat.

                                SHARON
                Can I ask you something very 
                  personal?  Do you feel... guilty 
                  about leaving people behind on New 
                  Caprica?

                                ADAMA
                  I don t do guilt.

  It s a transparent lie and they both know it.

                                SHARON
                You know, when you put me in this 
                  cell a year ago, I was at a 
                  crossroads.  I sat in here for 
                  weeks, just... consumed with rage 
                at the things that had happened to 
                me.  
                        (beat)
                But at some point, I realized it 
                was all just... guilt.  I was angry 
                at myself for the choices I d made.  
                  Betraying my people.  Losing the 
                  baby.  
                        (beat)
                So I had a choice.  I could move 
                  forward or stay in the past.  But 
                the only way to move forward was to 
                  forgive myself.

  Adama isn t looking at her, but he s listening.  Sharon 
    reaches out, puts her hand on his -- a very intimate gesture.

                                SHARON (cont d)
                  I don t think we can survive -- I 
                  don t think the fleet or Galactica 
                or the people on New Caprica can 
                  survive -- unless the man at the 
                top finds a way to forgive himself.

  On Adama as he considers her words...

  FADE IN:


  Duck is kneeling at a small ALTAR in his tent, praying to 
  ICONS of the gods.

                                DUCK
                ... I know I haven t lived the 
                  model life.  Made a lot of 
                  mistakes.  But I m asking for your 
                  protection today...

    A PHOTO of Duck and a lovely girl (NORA) --  both in their 
    flightsuits aboard Galactica -- sits next to the altar.


    Baltar and Caprica Six lying in bed.  Baltar is staring at 
  the ceiling.  Caprica Six wakes up.

                                CAPRICA SIX
                  You re up?

                  last listening bird almost got 
                  popped by a pair yesterday.


    Tyrol, Anders, and Tigh in the insurgent hideout once more.  
  Tyrol is fiddling with a portable WIRELESS SET.

                                TYROL
                  It s working... I think.

                                TIGH
                Is it working or isn t it?

                                TYROL
                  They re still jamming us...

                So much for our  source  on the 
                  inside...


  Duck is buttoning up a civilian SHIRT, beneath which we catch 
    a glimpse of EXPLOSIVES.  He puts a jacket on over it, then 
    checks his reflection in a small MIRROR.  He stares at 
    himself for a long beat... then stuffs his NCP UNIFORM into a 
    backpack.


    Caprica Six is helping Baltar get dressed.

                                CAPRICA SIX
                  You re a good man, making the best 
                of a bad situation and you have 
                  nothing to be ashamed of.

                                BALTAR
                  That s what I keep telling 
                  myself...


  Tigh, Tyrol and Anders as before.

                                ANDERS
                  Okay -- sun s up.  We gotta get 
                  going.

    Racetrack checks the time.

                  Time s up.  Spin up the FTL and get

                and let s get the hell back to 
                  Galactica.


    Suddenly the wireless begins BEEPING -- it s so loud and 
    startling that they all jump back.

                                ANDERS
                  Frak!  Turn that thing down!

  Tyrol quickly works and the BEEPING gets much quieter.

                                TYROL
                  It s working!  We got a signal!  A 
                  Raptor s made contact with us!

  The three men look at one another in astonishment.

                                TIGH
                  What s it say?

  The words mean everything to the three men standing in the 
  dark.  Tyrol puts a hand to his face, on the verge of tears 
  and there s a long quiet beat as each man begins to realize 
  for the first time that maybe the long nightmare will end.  


  Duck is buttoning up his uniform jacket in an out of the way 
  place in the large Hall.  Other PEOPLE wearing similar 
    uniforms to Duck are milling about in the b.g. and starting 
  to fall into ranks.


    Baltar and Caprica Six.

                                BALTAR
                  I thank you for that.  I do believe 
                in what I m doing.

  Gaeta ENTERS.

                  ceremony.

                                BALTAR
                I m not going.  Security concerns.  
                  It s all right.  There ll be other 
                  graduations.

  Gaeta hesitates for just a second.

                        (calm)
                  Right.  Okay.  I should... let 
                  the... staff know.

  Gaeta EXITS.


    A large open space within the Academy compound.  POLICE 
    CADETS are lining up in ranks before a REVIEWING STAND, 
    flanked by Colonial FLAGS.  Duck is in the crowd.  On the 
    reviewing stand are Leoben, Doral, Six and Brother Cavil.  
    D Anna climbs up the stairs and joins the others.


    D Anna is addressing the crowd of cadets.

                                D ANNA
                You are the hope, the dream of a

  Adama and Helo are on the handsets, listening to Racetrack.

                We made contact, I say again -- we

  Adama and Helo exchange a look and Adama allows himself just 
  the smallest of smiles.

                  Colonel Tigh has formed an

                  instructions on how to coordinate 
                the rescue effort.

  The cadets are walking in a line to receive their diplomas 
  from D Anna and Leoben.  As Duck approaches the podium, he 
  takes a deep breath and reaches out to shake Leoben s hand, 
  and at the same time, reaches inside his uniform tunic with 
  the other hand...
