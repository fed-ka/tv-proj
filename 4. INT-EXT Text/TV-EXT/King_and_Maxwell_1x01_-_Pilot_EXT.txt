Early morning. The Capitol Building framed at the end of a 
downtown street.  And we're moving, gathering speed, looking 
behind our direction of travel, so that what we see is only 
revealed once we've passed...

A loud SMASH! as we pass through an intersection and the 
aftermath of an auto crash, dazed drivers getting out of 
their cars... And we're still gathering speed... 

More carnage on both sides of the street, parked cars side-
swiped, signposts, trashcans and a mailbox crushed... Water 
rocketing skyward from a shattered fire hydrant...  

And now we're passing a speeding sedan, skillfully driven by 
a woman who we ll come to know as MICHELLE MAXWELL, 30s.  
Leaving the sedan behind as we draw up alongside the vehicle 
she is pursuing... An empty Greyhound Bus, the driver a 
middle-aged man named EDDIE FINCH, who s wearing a furry 
animal costume.

A moment more to establish the chase, then the bus swerves, 
Finch over-corrects and the Greyhound flips onto its side and 
slides down the road, showering sparks and shedding sheet 
metal before grinding to a stop, blocking the street.

Finch scrambles out as the sedan brakes violently behind the 
bus. Michelle leaps out, gives chase, giving us our first 
good look at her. Tall. Athletic. Dangerously beautiful.


Finch runs up a flight of steps to a Government building.  
The sign on the door reads: Senator J. Patrick Brady. He 
rattles the door. Closed. He spins back to face Michelle, 
pulls a handgun. Michelle stops in her tracks, eyes him 
steadily.  

MICHELLE
You shoot better than you drive, 
Eddie?

FINCH
Don t come any closer!

He tightens his grip on the gun, clearly nervous.  A beat, 
then a cell-phone rings.  Finch s cellphone.  King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         2


MICHELLE
You going to answer that?

Finch, flustered, pulls out his cell-phone. 

FINCH
Yeah?

MAN S VOICE
(phone filter)
Put the gun down.

FINCH
(looks around nervously)
Who says?

MAN S VOICE
The guy behind the laser sight.

FINCH
What laser?

MAN S VOICE
The one on your furry little chest.

Finch glances down, sees a RED LASER DOT centered on his 
chest.  He sucks in a breath. Slowly puts the gun down.

MAN S VOICE (CONT D)
Now tell the nice lady she owes me ten 
bucks.

FINCH
He says you owe him ten dollars.

Michelle sighs, moves forward, kicks Finch s gun clear as 
SEAN KING, 30s, steps from the shadows at the top of the 
steps.  Tall, handsome and armed with a disarming smile, a 
cell phone and a combo PEN-LASER-POINTER.  Finch realizes 
he's been duped.  

SEAN
Didn t I tell you this is where he d 
end up?

MICHELLE
You were so confident, why didn t you 
make it a hundred?

SEAN
Because you don t have a hundred.

MICHELLE
He could have gone anywhere. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         3


SEAN
Yet here we are. And here s Eddie, 
trying to reach the senator to 
blackmail him because he knows the 
game s up.
(beat)
How many cars did he hit?  

MICHELLE
A couple.

SEAN
Sounded more like a coupla dozen. 

Michelle deftly spins Finch around, zip tie his wrists.

FINCH
I d like to see you do better wearing 
a suit like this, smart-ass.

SEAN
Tail s kinda flat for a rabbit.

FINCH
Beaver.
(off Sean s look)
These look like floppy ears to you?

At the same time, Michelle pulls an envelope from Finch s 
Beaver suit, opens it, reacts. Several photos. She holds them 
up for Sean. We glimpse Finch in his Beaver suit in a 
compromising position with a WOMAN.

MICHELLE
Nothing floppy here, Eddie. Senator s 
wife really liked the whole fur thing, 
huh?

FINCH
(pissed)
Just read me my rights.

Sean and Michelle exchange a look. Michelle shrugs.

SEAN
Ah...You ve got the right to remain 
silent. You have the right to speak to 
an attorney -

MICHELLE
You missed a bit.
(off his look)
Anything you say being used against 
you -

SEAN
I was coming to that - King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         4


MICHELLE
That bit comes before the attorney.

SEAN
I thought it came after -

MICHELLE
Before.

SEAN
So, you ve got the  right to remain 
silent  bit - 

MICHELLE
- then  anything you say can be used 
against you  -

SEAN
Anything you say  or do  can be used 
against you -

MICHELLESEAN
-  in a court of law. -  in a court of law...  Then 
you ve got the whole attorney 
thing.  And then the bit 
about the court appointing 
one if you re broke.
(looks to Finch)
That sound right to you?

A bemused Finch looks from one to the other.

FINCH
What kind of cops are you?

MICHELLE
We re not cops, Eddie.

The SQUEAL of CAR BRAKES.  She and Sean both react.

MICHELLE (CONT D)
They re the cops.

Finch turns as half a dozen Metro Police cars squeal to a 
stop and D.C.'s finest leap out, guns drawn. 

And off Michelle and Sean raising their hands...


They exit, Sean pausing to lace his shoes.

MICHELLE
What was plan  B  if he didn t put the 
gun down?  

SEAN
But he did.

MICHELLE
You didn t have a plan  B , did you, 
Sean?

SEAN
You were plan  B .  You had the gun.

MICHELLE
And yours was...?

SEAN
In the glove compartment.  
(off her look)
We were chasing an overweight guy in a 
Beaver suit.

MICHELLE
An armed Beaver.

SEAN
Who didn t even know the safety was on.

She watches him tie his laces.

MICHELLE
Ever heard of slip-ons?

SEAN
First slips-ons.  Then pants with 
elastic tops.  And before you know it 
you re wearing a hoodie and people 
think you re from L.A. 

MURDOCK S VOICE
Sean King? King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         7


Sean and Michelle both look up as two men step up, flashing 
FBI BADGES. Agent BRANDON MURDOCK, 40s, by the book and his 
junior partner Agent CARTER, late 20s.

MURDOCK
Agent Murdock, Agent Carter.  FBI. 

King finishes tying his shoes.  

SEAN
If this is about Eddie Finch, you ll 
have to talk to Metro.

MURDOCK
Do you know a man named Ted Bergin?

Not what Sean was expecting.

SEAN
He s a friend. Why?

MURDOCK
When did you last speak with him?

SEAN
A week ago.

MURDOCK
He called you last night.

SEAN
No he didn t.

MURDOCK
Yes he did.

SEAN
Hope you ve got a warrant if you re 
digging around in my phone records.

CARTER
According to Bergin s records, he  
logged a thirty second call to your 
cell last night at nine-forty-two.

As Sean pulls out his cellphone to check...

MICHELLE
What s this about?

MURDOCK
And you are?

MICHELLE
Michelle Maxwell. But I m guessing you 
already know that, don t you Agent 
Murdock? King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         8


Murdock eyes her steadily, no need to answer.

SEAN
Nine-forty-two, missed call. Went to 
voice-mail.

MURDOCK
On speaker if you don t mind.

Sean hesitates, looks at Michelle, then holds up the phone so 
they can all hear it.

BERGIN S VOICE
(phone filter)
Sean, it s Ted. I ve got new 
information about Edgar Roy. Call me 
back as soon as you get this, it s 
urgent.  

And the call ends.

MURDOCK
You know who Edgar Roy is?

SEAN
Yeah. Serial killer.  Ted s his 
attorney.

MICHELLE
You going to tell us what this is 
about now?

A moment, then...

MURDOCK
He s dead.

SEAN
Edgar Roy?

MURDOCK
Ted Bergin.  
(beat)
Murdered.

And off Sean s shock...

ACT ONE

FADE IN:


Late afternoon. Sean and Michelle pull up outside Bergin s 
law office in Michelle s LANDCRUISER.  As they get out, a 
couple of FBI AGENTS leave the office carrying archive boxes 
and add them to other boxes, files and computers in the trunk 
of their sedan. 

MICHELLE
Murdock s not wasting any time.  

The Agents clock Sean and Michelle as they enter the office.


An ugly concrete building wrapped in razor wire and bristling 
with cameras. A sedan slows to a stop at the main gate. A 
PRISON GUARD steps out to the car. Sean lowers the window.

SEAN
I m here to see an inmate.

PRISON GUARD
His name?

SEAN
Edgar Roy.

PRISON GUARD
And who are you?

SEAN
His lawyer.


Headlights sweep across the darkened house on the outskirts 
of the city. Michelle parks her Landcruiser in the driveway, 
gets out with her flashlight, heads for the house. 


FBI CRIME SCENE TAPE criss-crosses the front door, sealing 
it.  

MICHELLE
Crap.


Michelle crashes through the window, hits the ground, rolls 
clear of the sofa cushion and comes up in a crouched position 
- as a car engine roars into life. 

She sprints towards the street in time to see a SEDAN 
speeding away.  She unloads the rest of her clip,  hits the 
release.  The clip drops clear and she slams home a 
replacement.  

The car speeds into the night.

Michelle releases a steady, calming breath, turns back 
towards the house - and stops in her tracks as she sees a 
BODY slumped in the driveway.

She pulls out her flashlight, flicks it on to reveal...

...the lifeless body of Hilary Cunningham.

And off Michelle s stunned reaction...

ACT TWO

FADE IN:


Now a brightly lit crime scene. Sean drives up, surveys the 
scene. Police tape, squad cars, a forensic van and a dozen 
Cops and Forensic Technicians. And Hilary s body, a Cop 
holding back the shroud for a FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER to take 
photos.

With a heavy heart, Sean turns away, crosses to the 
Landcruiser, where Agent Murdock is talking to Michelle.  

MURDOCK
You entered a house sealed by the FBI 
as part of an ongoing murder 
investigation.

MICHELLE
Only the door was sealed.  And it 
still is...

Murdock glances across at the house - smashed windows, bullet 
riddled walls - and miraculously intact, the front door still 
criss-crossed with FBI crime scene tape.

Sean joins them, looks the question at Michelle, who answers 
with a discreet nod - she s fine.  She turns back to Murdock.

MICHELLE (CONT D)
I got in through an open window.

MURDOCK
Illegal entry.

MICHELLE
(holds up a key)
Not if you ve got one of these. I just 
chose to go in through the window.

Murdock pulls out a latex glove, takes the key.

MURDOCK
Where did you get it?

MICHELLE
Hilary gave it to me.

MURDOCK
Before or after you shot her?

Michelle fixes him with a cool look. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         21


MICHELLE
If I d shot her, she d be lying in a 
pool of blood.  She s not. She was 
shot earlier, her body dumped here.

MURDOCK
By you?

MICHELLE
Why would I do that?

Murdock holds her gaze.

MICHELLE (CONT D)
Ballistics will clear my gun as the 
murder weapon.

She opens the back door of her Landcruiser.

MICHELLE (CONT D)
You want to test for blood, be my 
guest.

Murdock peers in the back of the Landcruiser - it s a pigsty - 
empty water bottles, fast food wrappers, running shoes, an 
overflowing gym bag and assorted empty coffee cups.

MURDOCK
This your boyfriend s car?

Michelle s eyes narrow. 

MURDOCK (CONT D)
My mistake.
(beat)
Why would someone take a shot at you 
and dump a body?

MICHELLE
Warning me off the case maybe.

MURDOCK
Which is what I m doing right now. 

He looks from her to Sean.

MURDOCK (CONT'D)
I don t like private investigators.
They re usually cashed-out cops or 
enthusiastic amateurs -

MICHELLE
We re neither.

MURDOCK
No - you both worked together for the 
Secret Service - King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         22


MICHELLE
(correcting him)
Sean had already left when I joined.

MURDOCK
- and now you re both washed up bullet 
catchers who got  retired  because you 
screwed up.

Michelle fumes, Sean takes it a little better.  But not much.

MURDOCK (CONT D)
(to Michelle)
At least the guy you were supposed to be 
protecting didn t get killed.

And he looks pointedly at Sean who stares back unflinching.

MURDOCK (CONT D)
Stick to lost dogs and jealous 
husbands.  Leave this one to us.

He turns away.

MICHELLE
Aren t you going to ask me if I found 
anything in the house?

Murdock looks back at her, shakes his head - as if she could 
possibly have found something that the FBI s finest had 
missed. He keeps walking. Sean steps up alongside Michelle.

SEAN
Did you?

MICHELLE
Yeah. I just don t know what it means.
(beat)
What the hell have we stumbled into?

And off their shared concern...


Dawn. Oars break the glassy water. A two oared skulling-boat 
punches into frame, Michelle skillfully working the oars. She 
angles the boat towards a HOUSEBOAT moored on the river bank.


As Michelle glides alongside, Sean comes out, coffee in hand.  

SEAN
How was the commute?

MICHELLE
Better than yours.   King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         23


SEAN
Ever had a river-rage incident?  Been 
cut off by a tug boat captain?  Had 
words with a passenger ferry guy?  
Sprayed by a speeding jet-ski jock?

MICHELLE
Sean, I hate you in the mornings.

She ships the oars, climbs from the boat with a day pack.

SEAN
You do know normal people don t row to 
work, don t you?

MICHELLE
You should try it.

SEAN
I don t have an apartment near the 
river, like you do. 

MICHELLE
You could ride a bicycle.

SEAN
You mean the whole funny helmet skin 
tight lycra thing? Where would I put 
my gun? And my morning cup of joe? Do 
bicycles have cup-holders?

She ties off the skulling-boat, takes his coffee as she 
passes.

SEAN (CONT D)
You re welcome.

As she heads into the houseboat, he sneaks a peek into the 
skulling-boat.  Week old orange peels, half a banana, empty 
water bottles, assorted food wrappers, socks and a sweat-top.

SEAN (CONT D)
(with a wry smile)
Right there. That s why we could never 
get married. 

He follows her into the houseboat, calling after her...

SEAN (CONT D)
Hey, if I lived on the river we could 
boat-pool. You could row and I could 
sit in the back and read the Times all 
the way here to the office. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         24



Sean and Michelle pull up outside a house in a leafy suburb. 

Sean knocks some rubbish from the footwell as he gets out.  
He picks it up, looks for somewhere to put it, gives up, 
tosses it back into the Landcruiser. 

Michelle knocks as Sean joins her.  The door is opened by a 
woman in her late-30s. KELLY PAUL is tall, athletic and 
reserved.

KELLY
Yes?

SEAN
We re looking for Kelly Paul...

KELLY
You ve found her.  And you are?

SEAN
Sean King -

MICHELLE
Michelle Maxwell.

KELLY
Ted told me about you - 

Sean and Michelle exchange a quick look.

KELLY (CONT D)
I only just heard what happened... I 
was going to call...

MICHELLE
You know a man named Edgar Roy? King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         26


KELLY
He s my brother.

And off Sean and Michelle reacting...


Michelle is by the Landcruiser, watching Sean and Kelly as 
they step onto the porch.

KELLY
When he s stressed he shuts down, 
doesn t talk. But it doesn t mean he s 
not watching. Listening. Thinking.
(beat)
I don t care if you re doing this for 
Ted and not Edgar, Mister King.  Just 
get him out of there.... please.

Sean pulls out the coded whiteboard page. Shows her.

SEAN
Mean anything to you?

KELLY
(studies the page)
No, I m sorry.  Is it important?

SEAN
Maybe.

BACK AT THE LANDCRUISER

Michelle watches as Sean shakes Kelly s hand, crosses to the 
Landcruiser. 

MICHELLE
Any luck with the white board?

SEAN
No.

MICHELLE
Do you believe her?

SEAN
Every word.

MICHELLE
Then either someone s lying or not in 
the loop.
(off Sean s look)
Edgar Roy hasn t worked for the IRS 
for more than a year.

And off Sean s reaction...  King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         29



A modern office building sheathed in mirrored glass. Sean and 
Michelle park across the street in the Landcruiser.

MICHELLE
Money.

SEAN
That big black sucking hole called 
defense appropriations.

MICHELLE
Looks like Bunting s appropriated his 
fair share.
(frowns, seeing something)
See them?

SEAN
Three by the door, one curbside.

From their POV, FOUR MEN in suits, discreetly watching the 
passing traffic.  A stretched LIMO is parked at the curb.

MICHELLE
Protection detail.

SEAN
Government plates.  

MICHELLE
I know one of the agents. Tom Taylor. 

Sean takes two high-tech miniature EARWIGS from the console. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         36


MICHELLE (CONT D)
Used to work with State. Quick. Light 
on his feet.

SEAN
(hands her an earwig)
You saw him in action?

MICHELLE
Ballroom dancing.

As Sean reacts, Michelle gets out of the Landcruiser.

SEAN
Assignment?

MICHELLE
Date.

And she s angling across the street towards Bunting 
Industries.  She pulls out her cellphone.

Sean slips in his earwig, then digs through the crap behind 
the driver s seat and pulls out a camera with a telephoto 
lens. He raises the camera, checks out Taylor, snaps a couple 
of shots.

SEAN
Looks more like a Dick than a Tom.

INTERCUT WITH:


Michelle walks towards the limo, cellphone to her ear.

MICHELLE
Heard that.

SEAN S VOICE
(earwig distortion)
Comms check out A-OK.

TOM TAYLOR, early 40s, glances her way, reacts.  

MICHELLE
(faking a phone call)
That s great.  Mine too.  Ciao.

She turns off the cellphone, feigns surprise at seeing 
Taylor.

MICHELLE (CONT D)
Tom!

TAYLOR
Michelle... Hi... King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         37


He glances selfconsciously at the other Agents.

MICHELLE
Funny, I was just thinking about you - 
isn t that crazy?

SEAN S VOICE
Try insane.

TAYLOR
Really?

SEAN S VOICE
No.

MICHELLE
Yes. Really. 
(beat)
You working?

TAYLOR
Yeah...

MICHELLE
Still with State?

TAYLOR
Homeland Security.

SEAN S VOICE
No one else would have me.

MICHELLE
Who s your protectee?

TAYLOR
You know I can t tell you that.

MICHELLE
Professional curiosity. Sorry.
(turning on the charm)
Anyone I know?

TAYLOR
Er...maybe...

The faint garbled distortion of a voice from Taylor s earwig.  
He glances quickly towards the entrance.

SEAN S VOICE
Looks like we re about to find out.

TAYLOR
You should call me...

SEAN S VOICE
Dick. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         38


MICHELLE
Tom -

SEAN S VOICE
Or Harry.

MICHELLE
- that would be very -

SEAN S VOICE
Unlikely.

MICHELLE
- very -

SEAN S VOICE
Stupid of me.

MICHELLE
- cool.

SEAN S VOICE
Not.

Taylor smiles, pleased with himself, then he s on the move.

Sean begins taking photos as a WOMAN, late 40s, exits the 
building with PETER BUNTING and two other Agents. 

Michelle discreetly pulls out her phone, times her approach 
so she ll pass as the Woman and Bunting get in the limo. 
Bunting suddenly stops as he sees someone inside.

MAN S VOICE
Peter, so good to see you.

The Woman puts a firm hand on his back and Bunting 
reluctantly gets into the limo. The Woman follows.

MICHELLE
Recognize the protectee?

SEAN S VOICE
Ellen Foster. Assistant Director of 
Homeland Security.

Michelle slides in behind the wheel of the Landcruiser.

MICHELLE
There was someone in the limo. Bunting 
was definitely not happy to see him.

She starts the Landcruiser, pulls into the traffic. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         39



Sean and Michelle follow the limo, which is escorted by a 
second SUV containing Taylor and the security detail. 

MICHELLE
Ever been this side of the river? 

SEAN
Not without back-up.


The limo swings into the curb and Bunting gets out.  The limo 
and escort car speed off. Sean and Michelle pull over, get 
out as Bunting takes out his cellphone.

SEAN
Your friends mustn t like you to drop 
you off in this part of town. Need a 
ride?

BUNTING
I m good.  Thanks.
(into his phone)
Third Street. GPS is activated.

MICHELLE
Cavalry on their way, Mister Bunting?

BUNTING
Do I know you?

MICHELLE
Michelle Maxwell.  

SEAN
Sean King.  Our client s Edgar Roy.

BUNTING
I ve got nothing to say to you.

He turns, walks away.  Sean and Michelle go after him.

SEAN
Funny. Neither does he. That s why 
we d like you to fill in the gaps. 
(beat)
Starting with what kind of work Edgar 
Roy did...

BUNTING
I ll have my attorney call you. Make 
sure you ve got your own when he does. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         40


MICHELLE
Edgar Roy has a thing with numbers. 
What exactly did he do? Development? 
Research? Analyst?

Bunting reacts.

SEAN
And I think we have a winner.

Suddenly two SUVs swing into the curb. FOUR BIG GUYS get out. 

LEAD BODYGUARD
You okay Mister Bunting?

BUNTING
I m fine.

He glares from Sean to Michelle, heads for the nearest SUV as 
the Bodyguards quickly move forward to protect him.

SEAN
You know he s escaped from prison?

Bunting doesn t look back. 

MICHELLE
Who was the guy in the limo?

Bunting shoots her a look, clearly rattled. One of the 
Bodyguards grabs Michelle by the arm, blocks her from 
following.  She stops, looks from his hand to his face.

SEAN
Bad manners to grab a lady like that, 
pal. You might wanna reconsider.

BODYGUARD
You going to make me?

SEAN
No. She s a big girl.

The Bodyguard looks back at Michelle.

With blurring speed, Michelle pounds her foot into his knee. 
The Bodyguard goes down. The other Bodyguards react. So does 
Sean. 

In a fast-actioned fight sequence, Michelle puts down the 
second and third Bodyguards while Sean dispatches the fourth. 

But not before Bunting has sped off in one of the SUVs.

SEAN (CONT D)
Well, that was fun. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         41


MICHELLE
Hard way to get answers.   

They head back to the Landcruiser. Michelle pulls out her 
phone, plays back the video she shot at the limo.  

For a brief moment we glimpse the face of a man in the back 
of the limo as Foster firmly shoves Bunting in to join him.

SEAN
Don t recognize him.  

MICHELLE
Me neither.
(beat)
But I know someone who might.


Larry quickly exits the building, walks down the street.  
Michelle steps out in front of him, blocking his way. 

MICHELLE
Hi Larry. Same old habit, same old 
haunt.  
(beat)
Hope I didn t scare you.

LARRY
No FBI?

MICHELLE
Not that I m aware of.

LARRY
What do you want, Michelle?

MICHELLE
Cup of coffee.

And off Larry s resigned look...


The Landcruiser rolls to a stop outside an ugly three storey 
building. A SECURITY GUARD snoozes behind the desk in the 
foyer.

SEAN
Really? You sure this is the right 
address?

MICHELLE
What?  You think they d advertise?

Megan leans forward between the two front seats.  Sean won.

MEGAN
It looks deserted.

MICHELLE
Hasn t operated since Edgar Roy was 
arrested.  He s the only one who knows 
how to access The Wall.

MEGAN
You re going to try to break-in?

SEAN
Not break-in.  Walk-in.  Edgar Roy
left my business card where it could 
be found. He knew the FBI would show 
me because of the number on the back.
(beat)
He wanted me to see it.

MEGAN
So what is it?

SEAN
Our key in. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         49



CLOSE on Sean entering a seven digit number into a KEYPAD at 
a side entrance. He hesitates as he gets to the last digit.

SEAN
Was the last number a one or a seven?

MICHELLE
A seven...?

Sean s finger hovers over the seven, then he hits the one.  A 
red light on the keypad flicks to green and the door buzzes. 

SEAN
I win.

Michelle rolls her eyes, pulls the door open.

MICHELLE
(to Megan)
Stay behind us.

Megan nods and they enter the building. 


WIDE on a funeral service. Ted Bergin s funeral. Among the 
crowd of mourners, Sean, Michelle, Kelly Paul, Agent Murdock 
and standing head and shoulders over them all, Edgar. The 
services ends. The mourners begin to disperse. 

EDGAR
Who were the men in my barn?

SEAN
They were homeless, Edgar.  Flown in 
from a half a dozen different cities.  
They haven t been identified.

EDGAR
I m going to pull down the barn and 
plant an orchard.

MICHELLE
We could always use some help with our 
book-keeping if you re interested... 

EDGAR
Maybe.

KELLY
Thank you for what you ve done.

And she holds out a single dollar note to Sean.  A beat, then 
he takes it, smiles. Edgar and Kelly move away.

MICHELLE
A dollar?

SEAN
Our retainer.

MICHELLE
Fifty cents each? That s it?

SEAN
Closer to thirty cents after taxes.

Michelle shakes her head, turns away.  Sean falls in beside 
her. King & Maxwell  Revised Network 01-10-12                                         57


SEAN (CONT D)
The Agency is burying it, but Megan 
Riley was one of theirs. Briefly. They 
scrubbed her out. Psychologically 
unsuitable.

MICHELLE
Foster didn t seem to care.

SEAN
She was good. Still haven t figured 
out how she loaded my SIG...

MICHELLE
She didn t.  I did.

SEAN
You - what?

MICHELLE
I checked it before we left.  It was 
unloaded, so I put in a new clip. What 
good is an unloaded gun to anyone?

SEAN
You could have got us killed!  It was 
part of my plan!

MICHELLE
That was a plan?

SEAN
Well at least I had a plan!  Did you 
have a plan?

MICHELLE
No plan.

SEAN
Exactly.

MICHELLE
I like to improvise.

SEAN
How about improvising that ten bucks 
you owe me?

And off their banter we...
