GENERAL PUTKIN (O.S.)
I have been having ideas,
gentlemen. Challenging ideas. And
when I thought about these ideas I
thought about who in the U.S Army
would be most receptive to my
challenging ideas.
The Jeep pulls up at the SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE.
The General gets out, a brief case in his hand and
surveys the centre.

Don't shoot, I'm a reporter.
He walks off. Bob sighs, continues DOODLING in his

Well...we're real cheap.
Bob waits for more, but that's it. He holds out his hand.

BOB
Could I bum a smoke, Skip?
Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down
across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances
over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking
with some Marines. Bob watches them jealously.
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I sat there watching those
reporters and realized I didn't
want to be me anymore. I wanted to
be them. I wanted to face peril
and stand witness to the fall and
rise of nations.
Suddenly the TERRACE LIGHT above them flickers and goes
out. Lyn and Bob sit in the dark.

Everyone gets everything he wants.

A LIGHTER ignites in Lyn's hand, eerily lighting the

Bill hits the ground, which is luckily mainly composed of
MUD. He lies stunned as MORE HELICOPTERS lower around him
and his PLATOON begin to debark. The Helicopters barely
touch the ground before they take off again. SUPERED
TITLES read: Vietnam, January, 1973.
Bill gets up onto his knees and examines his M-16 - the
barrel clogged with earth. He pokes his finger into the
muzzle trying to clean it, then finds he can't get it
back out again.
BILL DJANGO
Oh, man...
He tries to pull his finger free, glances up and FREEZES.
Ahead of Bill and his Platoon is a WALL OF DEAD AMERICAN
TROOPS - rotting in the sun.
His men stand staring at the wall aghast. A PRIVATE
beside Bill snaps and opens FIRE, yelling wildly.
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)

another SOLDIER DROPS. The others flinch, scan the tree-

His men stare back at him, frightened.
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
TAKE HER OUT!
The Soldiers open fire - a deafening roar. The Woman
keeps on running as the foliage above her head is
shredded by bullets. NO SHOT COMES CLOSE. Bill watches
amazed.
BOB (V.O.)
Every single one of Bill's men
fired high. They instinctively
hadn't wanted to shoot another
person. Later Bill would come
across a study by General S.L.A
Marshall, which revealed that only
15-20 percent of fresh soldiers
shot to kill. The rest
aimed high, didn't fire at all, or
pretended to be busy doing
something else.
Bullets still flying above her head, the Woman stops
running, crouches down and RETURNS FIRE.
Bill is SHOT, stumbles backwards and falls into the mud,
his finger still stuck in his M-16. He lies there,
staring up at the sky, his expression one of puzzlement,
as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest.
BILL'S P.O.V - the edges of our vision darken down as the
sound FADES OUT. The darkness flows inwards, as if an
IRIS IS CLOSING DOWN - until only a PIN-POINT OF WHITE

What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon

vision. How could his men's

could this be turned into a

Terrified Bob, dives across the sand. The Young Iraqi
behind him also scrambles for cover.
Still firing, the Insurgent is suddenly aware of Lyn
sprinting towards him. Before he can turn to aim at him,
Lyn LEAPS into the air, spinning around, face contorted
as he emits a bizarre SHRIEK.
We FREEZE-FRAME ON HIM, HUNG IN MID-AIR.
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Now at the time I thought Lyn was
having some kind of fit here.
Later I discovered what he was
actually doing was performing the
Echmeyer technique.

91
OVER-HEAD SHOT - Ben lies on the ground staring up at us.
We hear the sound of an approaching engine.
BOB (V.O.)
Another demonstration involved
letting a recruit drive a jeep
over him. This, in the end, was to
be his undoing.
Next second a JEEP roars straight over Ben, going at
sixty miles an hour.
We FREEZE FRAME on the JEEP.
BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Before his untimely death Ben
caused quite a stir by advocating
his controversial "shock and awe"
knife attack method.
92
93
We UN-FREEZE ON LYN - as he whirls and shrieks towards
the Insurgent. Bob watches amazed from where he lies on
the sand.
BOB (V.O.)
Of course, Lyn didn't actually
have a knife with him at this
particular time...so I still think
what he did was kinda...reckless.
The Insurgent, understandably startled, flinches
backwards, trips over the water bottle and falls on his
ass.
Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to
POUND the fallen man with it. The Young Iraqi moves to
intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle.
The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the
door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races
away over the sand.
The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his
victim's flight. When he turns back Lyn has scooped up
the Insurgent's GUN and is aiming it at him.
Beat. Nobody moves.
94

The sun is rising as the PICK-UP TRUCK roars over the
sand and swerves onto the road.
INSIDE THE TRUCK
Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of the window, staring at
the road behind them.
BOB
(pulling his head
back in)
They're not coming! We're okay! Oh
God, we're gonna be okay!
The Truck crests a hill and we see the IRAQI MAN running
desperately down the road ahead of us, his hands tied.
LYN CASSADY
There he is.
He puts his foot down and the truck roars after the
running man.

TRACKING SHOT - pulling the IRAQI MAN, running for all
he's worth.
Lyn leans out of the truck window as he drives up behind
him.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
(yelling over the
ENGINE)
Sir? You're okay! We're Americans.
We're here to help you!
Terrified the Man sprints faster. Lyn tries to pass him,
but the Man veers at the same time and the truck CLIPS
him, sending him flying.
IN THE TRUCK
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
Oh crap!
BOB
What happened?
LYN CASSADY
(BRAKING)
I think I just ran him over.
95
95
Lyn runs over to where the MAN lies moaning on the road,
his head bleeding.
LYN CASSADY
Sir? Are you okay? (Beat) Bob,
give me a hand here will you?
Bob gets out and the two lift the Iraqi Man and begin to
carry him back towards the truck.
They stop listening to an approaching rumble.
BOB
Oh shit! Oh shit, they're coming!
They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man
dangling between them.
Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and
roar towards them. Seeing the road blocked by the truck,
the SUVs screech to a halt and several MEN IN FLAK
JACKETS AND SUNGLASSES tumble out in formation, aiming
their M-16's at Lyn and Bob.
ARMED MEN'S P.O.V - Lyn and Bob stare at them before
dropping the bound Iraqi on the ground. Bob waves
nervously.

We hear the opening of a period song as we...

A LONG line of cars are waiting for gas - Iraqi men,
women and children, suffering in the heat. Many of them
have been there for hours. The SUVs approach.
98
INSIDE THE SUV

The driver of the first SUV radios Nixon's car.
FIRST DRIVER (O.S.)
(Over radio)
We've got a line for the gas
station here. Are we waiting?
NIXON'S DRIVER
(into radio)
Negative. We'd be way too exposed.
We're taking the station. Go in
fangs out.
He accelerates.
99
99
...as the two SUV's roar up, horns blaring, M-16's
bristling from the windows. The lead SUV rams the car at
the head of the line and sweeps it out of its path.
Nixon's SUV barrels through the gap and screeches to a
halt by the pumps. The THREE SECURITY MEN roll out
showily, machine guns ready.
TEXAN SECURITY MAN
Secure the perimeter!
The men fan out to the corners of the station, while the
first SUV blocks the road and more SECURITY pile out,
guns raised to cover the line of cars. There are howls of
protest from the waiting Iraqis.
Inside the SUV Bob, Lyn and Mahmud watch in astonishment.
TEXAN SECURITY MAN (CONT'D)
Give her the go-juice, Eddy!
CHILEAN SECURITY MAN
I filled her up last time.
TEXAN SECURITY MAN
Bullshit.
NIXON
(cheerfully, out of
the window)
He did fill her up last time Gary.

TEXAN SECURITY MAN
With respect sir, bull-fucking-

THIRD SECURITY MAN
Every time! Can we get some sort
of fucking system so we don't...
We hear a sudden, sharp POPPING sound. Immediately the
Men drop into CROUCHES, scanning the area.
TEXAN SECURITY MAN
(YELLING)
Contact! We've got contact!
He opens FIRE - IMMEDIATE CHAOS: people scream, duck
down, some cars reverse desperately and collide with the
cars behind. The other Security Men join in the shooting.
THIRD SECURITY MAN
(SHOOTING)
Where? Where's the shooter?
100
ACROSS THE STREET
100
Another SUV - identical, but black, is passing, hemmed in
by traffic. A stray BULLET from the gas-station pings off
it's armor plating. Immediately it screeches to a halt
and a NEW DETACHMENT OF SECURITY MEN roll from the car -
same flak-jackets and Oakley sunglasses but different
color uniforms.
NEW SECURITY MAN
(into radio)
Contact! We're under fire!
The New Detachment open FIRE blindly in the general
direction of the Station.
101
GAS STATION

THIRD SECURITY MAN
Two o'clock! Two o'clock!
All the Security Men turns and begin spraying bullets
across the road. Car windshields and windows explode.

A scowling Nixon has slid low in his seat.

Bob flinches as another bullet ricochets off the SUV.
BOB
Sounds good Muhammad.
MAHMUD DAASH

As machine-gun fire from across the street strafes the
station and Nixon's Security men return fire blindly.
FIRST SECURITY MAN
(yelling into Radio)
Krom One this is Freedom Frontier.
We are under attack. This is a
FUBAR situation. Requesting Kiowa!
Behind him Lyn, Bob and Mahmud crawl across the station
on their hands and knees, bullets zipping past them.
103
103
Mahmud leads Bob and Lyn at a crouching run down the
street, amongst the crowd of Iraqis fleeing the gunfire
behind them. We hear the whup-whup of a helicopter as a
Kiowa Warrior passes over head.
Moments later we hear an EXPLOSION as the helicopter
opens fire with a MISSILE...
104
111
Larry and Norm are jogging together, deep in
conversation.
BOB (V.O.)
Larry Hooper wasted no time
befriending the newcomer.
Desperate to compete with Lyn,
Larry had been doing research into
the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA
experiments which he believed
could enhance his own psychic
powers.
112
115
A NAKED AND DEMENTED NORM walks through the base, firing
random shots at scattering soldiers with his Beretta. He
finds Bill blocking his way.
BILL DJANGO
(GENTLY)
Norm? Give me the gun, Norm.
Norm starts to cry. Then he puts the gun into his
mouth...
116
119
Bill, a broken man, is walking off the base. He reaches
the gates and sees Lyn waiting for him.
BILL DJANGO
Continue the work, Lyn. The World
needs the Jedis, now more than
ever.
Lyn can't speak. Bill hugs him and walks off, the gates
closing after him.

122
Lyn and Bob are waiting on the quiet road which is
studded with burnt out CARS.
Mahmud drives an old Renault out of a warehouse and over
to them. He gets out the car and hands Lyn the keys.
LYN CASSADY
I really appreciate this sir.

The car has pulled over at a junction.

Lyn sits staring out at the emptiness, looking, perhaps
for the first time, worried.
BOB
(PEEVISH)
Jesus Christ. We could'a bought a
map if you'd said.
LYN CASSADY
Bedouins have been navigating this
desert for centuries without maps.
You can use a wrist-watch in
conjunction with the sun.
BOB
Well?
LYN CASSADY
What?
BOB
(EXASPERATED)
Well...use your watch.
LYN CASSADY
I haven't got a watch.
BOB
Oh for the love of...Here...
He gives Lyn his watch. Lyn looks at the watch and turns
to stare at Bob.
BOB (CONT'D)
What?
LYN CASSADY
This is a digital watch, Bob.
BOB
So? That's...
LYN CASSADY
So you need a watch with hands for
Christ's sake!

Well how the hell am I supposed to
know?

BOB
Turns out you haven't even got a
watch! Now what the hell are we...
LYN CASSADY
Will you shut up? I don't need a
watch. I'm using Level Two.
BOB
(BEAT)
What?
LYN CASSADY
Level Two. Intuition. We were
trained to make correct decisions.
Somebody runs up to you and says
"There's a fork in the road. Do we
turn left or do we turn right? And
you go...(snapping his fingers)
"We go right!"
Bob stares at him.
BOB
Just...instant?
LYN CASSADY
Instant. (Snapping his fingers)
Just like that.
BOB
WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR HALF
AN HOUR! HOW'S THAT "INSTANT?"
Lyn abruptly starts the engine and takes the right turn.
BOB (CONT'D)
Oh, it's that way?
LYN CASSADY
(GRIMLY)
Yes. It's this way.

Right. Now you know.

Below us the car drives off into the empty landscape,
getting smaller and smaller. Then...
BOOM. We see the flash of the explosion and the Renault
is flipped like a toy car. A ribbon of black smoke rises
into the blue sky. Silence.
128
128
BOB's P.O.V - We are stumbling forward towards a sand
berm. We hear the sound of heavy breathing.
BOB (O.S.)
(CROAKING)
What...what happened?
Lyn is staggering over the sand with Bob on his back. He
is holding his backpack. Bob has a gash on his forehead
which is bleeding. Under the blood his face is white. In
the distance, behind them, we can see the column of black
smoke rising.
LYN CASSADY
IED.
BOB
(BEAT)
What?
LYN CASSADY
Improvised Explosive Device.
BOB
Oh Jesus.
LYN CASSADY
You're okay Bob. It's gonna be
okay.
BOB
I can't believe this. Great
fucking intuition Lyn. I
can't...put me down. I can walk.
Put me down.
Lyn puts Bob down. Bob keels sideways onto the sand and
lies there, wheezing.
BOB (CONT'D)
Oh, Jeez. Oh, Jeez.
LYN CASSADY
Alright, c'mon...
He hauls Bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him
and pulls him onto his back. Bob hangs there limply as
Lyn sets off again.
(CONTINUED)
78.

Lyn reaches up and gropes at Bob's face, removing his
spectacles. Bob doesn't notice.
BOB
Where are we going? We should stay
with the car so the army can find
us.
LYN CASSADY
Fedayeen will find us first.
BOB
Well, I disagree. I totally
disagree.(Beat) The Federal what?
LYN CASSADY
Fedayeen Saddam. Paramilitary.
Fellas who probably laid the IED.
They could be on their way now.
Hold this Bob.
He passes Bob his backpack. They stagger on in silence
for a moment, Bob jogging up and down on Lyn's back. Lyn
snaps the legs off Bob's glasses, uses them as improvised
divining rods to scan the sand ahead.
BOB
What are you doing?
LYN CASSADY
Could be IED's or mines around
here. I'm checking for
disturbances in the telluric
current.
BOB
(still dazed)
Are they my glasses?
Lyn doesn't answer, keeps on walking, struggling a little
under the weight. Beat.
BOB (CONT'D)
Jesus, it's hot. I'm so hot.
(Beat) Aren't you hot?
LYN CASSADY
(not unkindly)
Bob? It's pretty important you
keep your mouth closed, okay? You
can lose a lot of water through an
open mouth.
He staggers on with him.
79.
129
129
Bob trails after Lyn, his shirt tied around his head,
breathing hard. Lyn is still scanning the sand.
BOB
I can't breathe properly. I
can't...Oh boy...
He staggers, manages not to fall.
LYN CASSADY
You're okay.
BOB
I think I'm bleeding to death.
LYN CASSADY
You're not bleeding to death, Bob.
It's shock, okay? It's just the
shock. It'll pass. You're gonna be
okay.
BOB
If we'd stayed at the road we
would be safe now! Now we've got
no water, no food or, or...
(noticing Lyn's scanning) Will you
forget about the fucking tantric
currents?
LYN CASSADY
(PATIENTLY)
You're going to be okay.
BOB
Stop saying that! I just got blown
up! I'm in the middle of a desert!
I'M NOT GONNA BE OKAY!
LYN CASSADY
Bob, you're suffering from shock.
If you start panicking now your
heart's gonna stop.
Bob stares after him incredulously.
BOB
(losing it)
Is that...is that supposed to calm
me down?! (hurrying after him) You
know what color the seats were in
the frigging hotel but you
can't...you wanna observe
something Lyn? Observe the fucking
bomb in the middle of the road!

Lyn walks on without answering. Bob notices the sun is
sinking.
BOB (CONT'D)
Wait a minute. That's west. Al
Qaim's in that direction. We're
going the wrong way.
LYN CASSADY
The mission isn't in Al Qaim. It's
somewhere near Al Qaim.
BOB
Where?
LYN CASSADY
(BEAT)
I don't know.
BOB
Is that...is that...is that a
joke? We've come six hundred miles
and you don't know where we're
going?
LYN CASSADY
If the exact whereabouts of the
Target was known it wouldn't take
a Jedi to find them, would it?
Bob watches Lyn stare around him, looking pale and drawn
and, for the first time, afraid.
BOB
Who gave you the mission Lyn?
(Beat) Lyn?
LYN CASSADY
Bill did.
BOB
What?
LYN CASSADY
Bill did. He appeared in my
trailer two months ago. A psychic
projection. I could hear him
calling my name.
Bob is so staggered by this for a moment he can't speak.
BOB
(SOFTLY)
Oh...Oh Jesus.
LYN CASSADY
He needed me.

There's no-one fucking here.
Lyn starts to walk off but staggers and falls.
BOB (CONT'D)
Lyn!
Bob rushes to him, kneels beside him. Lyn clutches his
stomach, grimaces.
BOB (CONT'D)
Is it the Crohns?
LYN CASSADY
I don't have Crohns.
BOB
What's the matter with you?
LYN CASSADY
I'm dying.
Bob stares at him, stunned.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
I've been murdered.

Lyn sits staring up at the immense MOON above them.
Bob sits watching, huddled against the cold, in the
shelter of some rocks. Lyn gets up, stumbles back over to
him and lies down, struggling for breath, white with
pain.
LYN CASSADY
It's gone Bob. I can't find him.
I've lost my power. It's the
curse.
BOB
What curse?
LYN CASSADY
(With profound
SADNESS)
They took this... beautiful thing
we'd been building and they
corrupted it. They destroyed the
New Earth Army.

A Goat stands tethered in the desert. TITLES read "Nevada
Test Site, Frenchman Flat, 1951."
BOB (V.O.)
...whereas the army had long felt
fine about doing stuff to goats -
even testing atomic weapons on
them.
We hear the drone of an AEROPLANE high, high above. The
goat looks up...
136
137
Bob listens transfixed.
LYN CASSADY
This was the real deal, Bob. I was
at the Gateway. Afterwards I
realized I'd got injured.
BOB
Huh?
LYN CASSADY
Sympathetic injury I guess. I was
bruised all over.
BOB
So, it's not that the goat fought
back?
LYN CASSADY
(SADLY)
Goat didn't have a chance.
BOB
But...that was it?

I wish it was. Hooper told Holtz
we should try the experiment
again. Only this time they
said...kill the goat.

140
Lyn flushes with indignation at the memory.
LYN CASSADY
There was no way! What had the
goat ever done to me? It was
totally against the way of the
Jedi. I was just going to pretend
to try so they would say, "okay -
it can't be done" and forget about
it. But then, as I sat there, I
felt this, this pulse start inside
of me and...I couldn't stop it.
He turns to look at Bob, haunted.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
You know what I keep thinking?
141
144
Bob stares at Lyn aghast.
BOB
Collateral damage?
LYN CASSADY
(eyes glistening)
Collateral damage. (Beat) That was
it. I'd used my powers for evil
and it was like I brought a curse
upon us all. Like that poem where
the guy kills the seagull and they
make him wear it round his neck.
Every night
I'd dream of that goat in its
little bib, it's mouth opening and
closing but nothing coming out...
Bob shakes his head, stares out into the darkness.

Lyn, wearing civilian clothes and holding a suitcase, is
walking off the base. He reaches the gates and turns for
one last look at the place that has been his home.
BOB (V.O.)
But before he could leave Larry
arranged one last parting gift.
Lyn tuns back to the gates and finds Larry Hooper
standing in front of him, looking WIRED.
LYN CASSADY
What do you wan...?
Before he can finish Larry CHOPS his hand down in an odd
blow onto Lyn's forehead. Lyn staggers back a little,
holding his head.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
What the hell?
Larry has already darted around him with a crazy laugh
and is running madly back into the base. Lyn stares after
him, stunned.
LYN CASSADY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It was the Dim Mak.
146
146
Bob looks at Lyn, puzzled.
BOB
The Dim Mak?
LYN CASSADY
The Dim Mak. The Quivering Palm.
The Death Touch. It's like this
legendary, martial arts move. It
was forbidden in the New Earth
Army. Larry had got it from a mail-
order book.

It kills you Bob. With one touch.
BOB
Jesus.
LYN CASSADY
There's a story that Wong Wifu,
great Chinese martial artist, had
a fight with some guy and had him
beat when the guy gave him this
light tap, and Wong looked at him
and the guy just nodded. That was
it. He'd given him the death touch
and Wong died.
BOB
Then and there?
LYN CASSADY
No. Eighteen years later. That's
the weird thing with Dim Mak - you
never know when it's going to take
effect.
He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him
as he falls asleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
147

The same horizon, the dunes now burning under the sun. We
TRACK back and find Bob and Lyn lying asleep, lips
cracked, dehydrated, exhausted. Faintly we hear a sound -
a tinny BELL. It gets closer. Groggily Bob opens his eyes
just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him,
the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it
pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination. He
struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm he's been
lying at the foot of.
The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the
berm and disappears from sight.
Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying,
staring down at something.
CLOSE ON BOB'S FACE - stunned.
89.
148

Bob is dragging a barely conscious Lyn up the berm,
following the goat. He staggers, barely able to put one
foot in front of the other.
At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves
looking down on a WATER-HOLE, fringed with palms. The
goat stands drinking. It stops to look up at us.
149
149
Bob and Lyn collapse into the wet mud of the hole. Bob
manages to cup some water into Lyn's mouth and then his
own. He rolls onto his back, stares up at the burning
sky.
We hear a dull roaring, muffled, growing in volume. A
HELICOPTER is approaching...
FADE OUT.
In the BLACK we hear a VOICE.
ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.)

SUBTITLED)
In America if I do not like my
cell-phone company I change them.
I am in charge. This is consumer
power.

Lyn emerges blinking into the light. He stares around
him. The song is playing over speakers, echoing eerily
around the base.
A door slides shut with a clang nearby and Lyn turns to
locate the sound.
A trail of FOOTPRINTS leads across the sand to a HANGAR
nearby.
Lyn heads off across the sand, dragging the IV. Bob
emerges behind him.

Lyn reaches the sliding doors of the building and drags
them open and stands staring into the gloomy interior.
Bob catches him up.

INSIDE THE BUILDING
The place is full of GOATS.
Lyn and Bob stare at the animals. Slowly Lyn advances
into the darkness, peering around him.
In the shadows at the back of the building a figure
STIRS. Lyn walks slowly forward until he can make out the
man - old, bearded, worn and wasted by years of heavy
drinking. It's BILL DJANGO.
Lyn stares at him.
LYN CASSADY
(CHOKED)
Hello Bill.
Bill smiles hesitantly.
BILL DJANGO
Hello Lyn.
Lyn is too choked with emotion for a moment to answer.
LYN CASSADY
This is Bob.
BILL DJANGO
Hello Bob.
Bob is too amazed to reply.
LARRY HOOPER (O.S.)
Oh good...
Bob and Lyn turn to find Larry Hooper standing in the
doorway behind them.
LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D)

Lyn stares at Larry - shocked.

Bill Django sits cross-legged in the sand, drinking from

You know, he told me all these
stories about Bill Django, and I
was pretty excited to meet you,
but I've gotta tell you...you're
one big disappointment.
Bill doesn't react. Bob starts to walk away then turns
back, and throws the FEATHER down at Bill's feet.
BOB (CONT'D)
He told me to give you that back.
I don't know why. Its supposed to
be a mark of honour isn't it? I
don't see how you deserve that.
Beat. Bill turns to look at Bob for the first time. He
takes a long drink.
BILL DJANGO
(BEAT)
It isn't real.
BOB
What isn't?
BILL DJANGO
The feather. Twenty thousand
dollar fine for taking an eagle
feather. This one's off a turkey.
You just die the tip black. (Beat)
Don't tell Lyn.
Bill stares at the feather.
BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
None of it was real.
BOB
(ANGRILY)
That isn't true. That isn't true.
He looks around for inspiration - notices a LONE CLOUD
floating in the sky.
Bob places his fingers on his temples and STARES at the
cloud, focuses, desperate, hopeful...
Bill notices and watches, curious.
Slowly, the cloud fades and DISAPPEARS.

your face and my footsteps match
your heartbeat.

162
Bill and Bob both stand in a difficult position -
balanced on one leg.
LARRY AND LYN (V.O.)
...and all that comes after. I am
yours and you are mine.
As we watch Bill slowly topples forward off the table and
crashes out of sight below.
163
164
Bob is holding a concussed Bill who has a cut on his
head.
BOB
Bill? Bill are you okay?
Bill opens his eyes suddenly.
BILL DJANGO
I just saw Timothy Leary.
BOB
(BEAT)
Timothy Leary's dead.
BILL DJANGO
I know. He's had an idea.

CLOSE on a LOUDSPEAKER - blasting a period song out over
the base. We BOOM down to where two SOLDIERS are dancing,
tripping.
ALL OVER THE BASE
Soldiers are wandering around, talking, some falling to
their knees, weak with laughter. Some stand alone,
staring with a beatific smile at the sky.

As the music plays on a STRYKER ARMORED VEHICLE drives
around the corner of a building, a SOLDIER standing up,
arms raised, in the gun turret.
The Stryker screeches into a clumsy skid, the Soldier
having to hang on. The Stryker roars off again, heading
straight for the GATES of the base.
SOLDIER
(calling down into
the vehicle)
You're going to hit the gates.
You're going to hit the gates.
The Stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter
fence and out into the desert.
SOLDIER (CONT'D)
(CALMLY)
It's okay. You missed them.
169
173
As the music continues Bob, Lyn and Bill appear leading a
column of nervous IRAQI PRISONERS out of the building,
towards the gates. Lyn and Bill are holding BABY GOATS in
their ARMS. A tripping Bob is holding bunches of flowers -
it's as close as they can get to the illustration from
the New Earth Army Manual. Lyn holds up a hand to stop
the procession.
Larry stands in front of them, a GUN in his hand, his
face blank.
Lyn and Larry stare at each other. Then, unexpectedly,
Larry starts to cry.
LYN CASSADY
(SOFTLY)
Give me the gun Larry.
Larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth. Pauses.
Scratches his head.
LARRY HOOPER
Wow. I'm hungry.
He wanders off.
ARMY DJ (O.S.)
(Over loudspeaker,
LAUGHING)
Hey! More music! (muffled) Get
off, will ya?
Over the loud-speakers we hear the opening of a period
song.
LYN CASSADY
(Beat, relieved)
Okay, let's go.
174
FLATTENED SECTION OF FENCE
174
Bob and Lyn stand at one side, Bill at the other,
beckoning the prisoners through, hugging the prisoners as
they pass through.
LYN CASSADY
We're very sorry. Ma'assalama.
(CONTINUED)
105.

CONTINUED:

One by one the Iraqis walk out through the broken fence,
staring around them suspiciously, expecting a trap.
Nothing happens, no one shoots them.
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
(WAVING)
That's it. Keep going.
Ma'assalama.
The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand.
Beyond them we can the Stryker, driving in circles in the
desert, a NAKED SOLDIER stands whooping on top.
175
175
Bob, tripping heavily, is staring with fascination at the
sand trickling through his fingers. Suddenly we hear the
building whine of the HELICOPTER engine starting up. Bob
looks up, puzzled.
176
HELICOPTER
176
Bill and Lyn sit in the chopper, Bill at the controls.
Lyn is holding the flowers.
Bob appears, hurrying over.
BOB
(CALLING)
Wait! Wait for me! Where are you
going...what about the mission?
LYN CASSADY
(Over the sound of
the engine)
You are the mission Bob! You are
the mission! Tell them what
happened!
The helicopter begins to rise. Bob stands swaying,
staring up. Lyn smiles sadly through the window, raises
his hand.
The Helicopter RISES - HIGHER AND HIGHER. Bob waves
goodbye.
BOB (V.O.)
At the time I was hurt that Lyn
hadn't taken me with him. But now
I know it was because he and Bill
had already seen what was to come.
106.
177
177
As the helicopter flies off into the blue.
BOB (V.O.)
Nobody knows exactly what
happened. The official
story is that their helicopter
must have crashed, either because
they were hit by an RPG or
because...well, that's what
happens when you fly a helicopter
while you're tripping on acid. All
I know is they've never been seen
since. Like all Shaman they
returned to the sky.
The helicopter disappears altogether.
DISSOLVE TO:

179
Bob sits in his car staring at his old home, across the
road. Through the window we can see Bob's ex-wife Debora,
eating dinner with Bob's ex-Editor - Dave.
BOB (V.O.)
I sent it to the newspapers, the
radio stations, the TV stations,
because that was what Lyn wanted
me to do. The people needed to
know.
