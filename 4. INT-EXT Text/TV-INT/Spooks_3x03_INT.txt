      Saturday, Present.

      Zoe is dressing for a wedding.  Will lies on the bed.  She 
      walks past him in her underwear holding a Grace Kelly dress 
      in front of herself.

                                  ZOE
                     Preview of forthcoming attraction 
                    ... 


                                  WILL
                    Grace Kelly in ... Rear Window.

                                  ZOE
                    Know-all.

      She stops a moment.

                                  ZOE
                    You know what?  I ve been looking 
                    forward to this ... all week.

                                  WILL
                    That long?

      She smiles. 

                                  ZOE
                    It s been a long week, alright?

      Will and Zoe, now dressed, come out of her room and go to 
      leave the flat.  They have overnight bags with them.  Zoe 
                                                                                              *
      stops when she sees Danny, lying awake on the sofa. Still in 
      his clothes from last night.  A empty wine bottle and an old 
      book next to him. (Later we will know the book is The Wisden)

      He never made it to his bed.

                                  WILL
                    I ll see you outside.
                                                                                              *

      Zoe nods, he heads off and she goes over to Danny.  She 
      stands for a moment.  Then he looks up and sees her.

                                  ZOE
                    Danny... it s me... you should get 
                    some sleep...

      He looks at her taking moment to focus. 

                                  ZOE
                    ... in a bed.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                  ZOE

                          (a beat)
                    Will you be OK?

                                  DANNY
                    Yeah. Zoe, I ve been thinking about 
                    Tom, what he did ...
                                                                                              *

      He looks at her.

                                  DANNY
                    He was right.  You have to seize

                    the day.  I guess he thought that 
                    he had to act: he had to get out 
                    while the going was good. 

                                  ZOE
                    You re not thinking about ...

                                  DANNY
                    No, not at all, it s ... you know 
                    how our job, what we go through, 
                    can really only be understood by 
                    someone who lives this life?

                                  ZOE
                    They have a particular 
                      understanding, sure ...

                                  DANNY
                    ... No, there s more to it than 
                    that. And we ve been ignoring it, 
                                                                                              **

      He takes her hand.

                                  ZOE
                    Danny, there isn t anything going 
                    on.

      Only here Zoe heads off.  Get to the hall.  Stops.  Thinks 
      about it a moment.  Then comes back again.  She has to deal 
      with this.

                                  ZOE

      Danny slumps back on the sofa, the week just gone still in 
      his head.

      Monday, the beginning of that week.

      Kevlar vest under his jacket, earpiece, Sig 9mm in a shoulder 
      holster, DANNY stands with his back to a wall shelved with 
      books.

      ZULI: late forties, half-moon glasses, expensive suit. 
      Writer, intellectual, brought up in Pakistan, educated at 
      Yale and Cambridge.  And now, under a fatwa, the most wanted 
      man in the West.

      He argues in Urdu with his friend HARAKAT who runs the 
      bookshop and who is older, balder and wears traditional 
      Islamic robes.  They sit on large cushions, drinking coffee 
      and smoking foul-smelling Turkish cigarettes. 

      Danny watches them.  Guesses they re arguing about politics 
      or women or both.



                                  ZULI
                    What do you think Danny? 

      He looks at them.

                                  DANNY
                    My Urdu s a little rusty.

                                  ZULI
                    Harakat thinks I should consider 
                      renouncing what I wrote and then 
                    the fatwa would be lifted.

                                  DANNY
                    But what about me? What will I do 
                    then?

      The others laugh.

                                  ZULI
                    Go back to breaking into foreign 
                    embassies or stitching up 
                      Greenpeace or whatever it was you 
                    were doing before ...

      Danny shakes his head.

                                  DANNY
                    Trainee stuff.

      Danny smiles as they go back to talking in Urdu.

      Danny sees the faintest of movements on the back door.  Wind 
      or an outer door opening fractionally.

      His comms are voice activated.  He looks at his watch.

                                  DANNY
                    Zoe, is that ... ?

      Only he never finishes the sentence because the door SLAMS 
      OPEN TO REVEAL:

      A man with body armour, balaclava and a short stock assault 
      rifle already up in the shoulder.  Just enough like a 
      policemen to make you think twice.

      The room freezes.  Zuli and Harakat s argument cut off in mid-
      air.

      ANGLE ON: Zuli s eyes.  He s been imagining this moment 
      forever and here it is.

      ANGLE ON: Danny.  In one movement his gun is out, safety 
      catch off and he fires two rounds as he piles across the room 
      into Zuli.  Bringing him down hard.  

      Just as the first burst of fire sprays from the intruder s 
      gun, chewing up the packed bookcase behind them.

                    Red! Red! Zoe!

      Danny fires again.  Two shots ricochet off the wall and 
      around the room like pin ball.  The intruder is down, 
      crouched for an instant.

      But then he s back up.  Unhurt.

      GUNMAN S POV: he has a clear shot of Danny trying to drag 
      Zuli behind a table.


      Nothing can stop him this time: 

      He fires his second burst which would kill them both except 
      for ...

      Danny and Zoe are crouched beside an injured Harakat.  A

      heavily guarded Zuli is being taken out of the front of the 
      building.  Sirens can be heard getting closer.

1818

      Adam s catching up with Zoe and Danny as they walk through 
      the pods and onto the grid.  Danny coming down.  The shooting 
      still ringing in his ear. 

      Zoe holds out the clear plastic forensic bag for Danny s 9mm 
      and spare magazine.

      Danny unplugs his earpiece and transmitter.  Drops them in a 
      separate bag.

1919

      Danny has a book in front of him.  Malcolm sits with him 
      turning the pages.  Photographs and silhouettes of weapons. 
      While it s still fresh.  Weapon Identification. 

      Danny goes back on one of them.  His hand shaking slightly on 
      the page.

                                  DANNY
                    That s it.

                    No, it s not.  There s something 
                    missing.

      He concentrates hard a minute, goes back there.

                                  DANNY
                    Only the barrel had ... some sort 
                    of silencer.  The sound was 
                    muffled.

      Malcolm looks at him sceptically.  There s nothing in the 
      book to indicate this.

                                  DANNY
                          (slower)
                    It had some sort of silencer.

                    I very much doubt ...

      Danny looks at him.

                    I mean I ll look into it but ...

      Zoe comes in just in time to save Malcolm being decked.

                    Yes, it is our job.  It was because

                    I ve always thought it a shame that  
                    the service has to be the first to 
                    know when we re serious about

      Ruth looks at Zoe a moment ... so she s serious about this 
      guy.  Adam comes over.

                                  ADAM
                    Ruth ... ?

      They move away.

                    I need some research done on one of 
                    the people involved ...

      Ruth looks up at him.

                                  RUTH
                    Zuli?

                                  ADAM
                    He s being covered.  And Zoe and 
                    Danny will be on the hitman.  No, I 
                    want you to check out our friend - 
                    the bookseller Harakat. 

      She looks at him.

                                  ADAM
                      I sometimes think it s useful to 
                    look at an operation from a less 
                    obvious viewpoint.  Cover all 
                    bases.

      And before she can ask.

                                  ADAM
                    Harry tells me you re the soul of 
                      discretion?

      She pauses a moment, flattered.

                                  RUTH
                    Did he?  Well ... I try ... 

                                  ADAM
                    Good.  Thought so. 

      He starts to walk away to his desk when Ruth calls to him.

                                  RUTH
                    Oh and Tom ... !  Sorry ... oh God 
                    ... so sorry ... Adam ... I assume 
                    that means that you don t want me 
                    to distribute my research to the 
                    rest of the office as normal? 

                                  ADAM
                    That s right.  Ruth.

      A table with neatly arranged photographs, drawings, maps 
      cartridges, replica weapons.

      Zoe and Danny heading up the operation, doing research into 
      who the hitman might be.  Zoe is writing suspects on the 
      board.  None yet.

      Malcolm puts a plastic forensic bag on the table.  In it is a 
      metal box the size of a packet of cigarette.

                                    MALCOLM
                    The forensic boys found this under 
                    our wagon.  It s a jamming device 
                    that can be triggered up to 500 
                    metres away.  It s what brought 
                    down the comms.

                                  DANNY
                    Thanks Malcolm.

                                  ZOE
                    Look at this: the list of everyone 
                    who had access to Zuli s schedule.
                                                                                              *

      It runs to 3 pages.  Single spaced.  Great.


                                  DANNY
                    Scotland Yard, M.I.6, Home Office, 
                    Number 10, the Cabinet Office ... 
                    most of the rest of Whitehall by 
                    the looks of it.

      She hands him the list.

                                  ZOE
                    And there s a ton of CCTV footage 
                    from the security camera inside the 
                    book shop.

      She indicates the boxes in the corner.

                                  ZOE
                    I guess the hitman would have

                    That s fine. Just do as he says.  I 
                    brought Adam to resolve the Tom 
                    problem ...

                    ... And now you intend to keep him 
                    on?

      Harry looks at her.  He ll share stuff with her that he won t 
      share with anyone else.

                                  HARRY 
                    I haven t decided.  But whatever I 
                    decide, whoever joins the team, I 
                    still very much see you as one of 
                    the senior pros - to use an old 
                    cricket expression.

                                  RUTH
                    And Adam s what?  Our new Captain?

                                  HARRY
                    I don t know yet.  I only know that 
                    I want someone from outside.

      She turns to go.  Pauses a moment.

                                  RUTH
                    So all that makes someone like 
                    Malcolm - what?  Head Groundsman?

                                  HARRY
                    I think we can probably take the 
                    analogy too far.  Don t you?

      Ruth reporting to Adam.

      He s looking at a piece of paper she s handed him.

      He looks at it briefly.

                    Well, I think it reads like ... 
                    like a not very good legend ... 
                    something an M.I.6 case officer

      A moment between them.  A smile.

                    I tell you if there d been anywhere 
                    to run I d have been the first out.

      Danny laughs.  Maybe this isn t so bad.

                                  DANNY
                    And I d have been close behind.

      He looks at Danny.

                                    HARAKAT
                    That s where you re wrong.  The 
                    world is divided into two types: 
                    people like you who go looking for 
                    trouble and sensible people who 
                    avoid it.  In a moment of insanity 
                    I stepped over the line and look 
                    what happened.  I should have stuck 
                    to my books.

                                  DANNY
                    Well, Zuli and I are still around 
                    because of it.

      A pause.

                                    HARAKAT
                    Why do they think I need 
                      protection?

      He shakes his head - it s no big deal.

                                  DANNY
                    I guess it s because you were the 
                    only one who saw the hitman and he 
                    may come after you.  Probably  
                    someone s heard some chatter on the 
                    wire somewhere.

                                    HARAKAT
                    You saw him, too.

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe I need protection as well

      Danny looks at him.

                                    HARAKAT
                     But who guards the guards?  

                                  DANNY
                    I think they expect us to be able 
                    to look after ourselves.

      Ruth and Malcolm still matching the cctv and the suspects. 
      The forgery suite is dark and quiet.

      Ruth slumps back bored.

      Silence.  It s a terrible joke.  Ruth laughs despite herself.

                    This is our main hitman suspect. 
                    His name is Sharaf Al-Youm.  He 
                    came through Heathrow on a tourist 
                    visa a few weeks ago.

      Then back to the screen.  Another CCTV image of him in the

      FLASH TO: Another black and white photo.  Here s Al Youm in 
      uniform, stands with a group of heavily armed soldiers in

                    Oliver, this was the man who was 
                    hit when someone had a pop at our 
                    esteemed novelist Zuli.

                                  HARRY
                    Well, to me this application reads 
                    like something written by an 
                    analyst.  One of those spotty M.I.6 
                    mutants they keep in the dungeons 
                    at Vauxhall Bridge Road, beside 
                    where  C  grows his magic 
                      mushrooms. 

      Mace sighs.

                                  MACE
                    Harry, we may not be able to see 
                    the massed, red-coated ranks of 
                    England s finest piling across the 
                    field at Waterloo, but to all 
                    intents and purposes, we re at war 
                    ...

      He picks up the piece of paper and waves it around.

                                  MACE
                    And you re asking me to check up on 
                    whether twenty years ago some Mr 
                    Harakat really was a trainee shelf-
                    stacker at the Karachi Pic n  Mix 
                    ... ?

                                  HARRY
                    OK.  I ll keep it simple: you 
                    monitor both Five and Six.  So all 
                    I m asking is do you know anything 
                    about this person Harakat?

      He knows that he won t tell him. 

                                  MACE
                    Of course not.  Harry, we re on the 
                    same side. Don t you think that 
                    instead of wasting your time on 
                    this childish inter-agency rivalry 
                    you should concentrate your 
                    energies on trying to plug some of 
                    the gaps in your own security ... ?

                                  HARRY
                    Meaning what?

                                  MACE
                    As I hear it, the reason this poor 
                    chap was shot was that half of 
                    London knew Zuli s schedule. 

      Harry nods.  Fair point.

                                  HARRY
                    So there s nothing on Harakat 
                    that s not being shared.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      Danny watches out of the window while Harakat watches him.  
      Harakat carefully stands and joins Danny at the window.  He 
      hands him a package with the book in it.

                                    HARAKAT
                    Danny ... I want you to have this.

      Danny takes the package from him.

                    I m sorry for what Zuli said at the 
                    meeting.  He certainly wasn t 
                    speaking for me.  Gratitude isn t 
                    really one of his things.

                    Please open it.  If you don t like 
                    it then you can give it back to me 
                    or sell it.

      Danny slides out a book.  Old faded and yellow ...

      CLOSE ON: Danny s eyes widen as he looks at the title. 

      It s a copy of the annual Cricket almanac: The Wisden.  But 
      not just any old Wisden.  It s the 1913 edition, the rarest

                    Pakistani Terrorist Group - the 
                    Path of Light.  Originated in 
                    Kashmir but now extended their 
                      operations to the whole of South 
                    East Asia, certainly one of the 
                    most vicious and bloody groups 
                    we ve dealt with.

      Colin has his magnifying glass out.

                    I think it was taken by an American 
                    spy plane.  Probably a Predator 
                    from about 25,000ft over the Middle 
                    East somewhere.  Apparently, even 
                    from that height the cameras can 
                    read the letters on the side of a 
                    can of Coke.

      Danny looks at him.

                    That it says Coke on the side?  
                    They already know that.

                    I m not saying that s what they use 
                    it for.  I m saying they could. 
                    That s its capability.

      Danny, Zoe and Colin are watching the image enhancer.

      On the SCREEN: the image of the two figures is focused and 
      enhanced.

      We can actually track round the faces in 3D.

      We see Khordad and then the other face from a few black and 
      white dots.  It turns into something recognisably human and 
      then in and out of focus until ...

      We realise that it s Oliver Mace s face looking out at us.

                    A deep throat?

                                  HARRY
                    It s not a term I much care for, 
                    but yes.  You ll understand she s 
                                                                                              *
                    not someone I can be seen anywhere 
                    near but here s where and when you 
                    can meet her. None of it is 
                      negotiable I m afraid.  This woman 
                    is taking a tremendous risk in 
                    helping us.  If she s identified 
                    ... even suspected ...

      Adam understands the seriousness of this.

                                  ADAM
                    Who is she?

                                  HARRY
                    Let s just call her a very senior 
                      government official.  We were at 
                    Cambridge together, Trinity. 

      Adam smiles.

                                  HARRY
                    Don t let me down on this one Adam. 
                    Because afterwards I think we 
                    should talk about the future.  You 
                    and M.I.5.

      Adam knows that for him in all ways this is a big test.

                                                                                              *64A64A

      In their midst we see the LSE GRAD coming through to his
