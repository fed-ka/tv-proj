      Late afternoon practice.  The Hellcats jam through their 
      paces.  Vanessa barks orders from the sidelines. 

                                  VANESSA
                    Sierra!  Squeeze tighter -- you re 
                    making Darwin work too hard!  

      ANGLE ON:  A SMALL GROUP OF TOWNIES, 

      hanging out under the bleachers with nothing better to do 
      than drink beer and watch the cheerleaders practice. 

                                  VANESSA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    You wanna make the castle, you 
                    gotta get your head in it!

    The only girl in the group is MARTY BERGER (21).  She s a 
      townie too, but the pile of textbooks beside her tell us 
      she s also a student.  Marty is wicked smart, an acerbic 
      outsider.            "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           4.


      She s also athletic, but covers it with a punky, Gwen Stefani
      vibe-- light years from the conventionally pretty 
      cheerleaders across the field.  She s shooting the shitwith 
    DAN PATCH (24), a shambling charmer.  

                                  DAN 
                    What makes a person decide to 
                    become a cheerleader?

                                  MARTY 
                    Science.  Over time, all that pep 
                    builds up pressure.  If they don t 
                    vent, their heads explode. 

      Vanessa blows her whistle.  The Hellcats form a human pyramid 
      with flyers being thrown into position by the bases.

                                  MARTY (CONT D (CONT D)
                    I don t trust any culture that 
                    builds pyramids, human or 
                    otherwise.  Egyptians enslaved the 
                    Jews, Aztecs did human 
                      sacrifices... 

                                  DAN
                    Freemasons put pyramids on money.  
                    And gave Dan Brown something to 
                    write a lame book about.  

                                  MARTY
                    They ve earned their spot in 
                    hell...  

      Marty eyes Sierra doing a  shoulderstand,  a difficult stunt 
    in which her base tosses her into the air and catches her on 
    his shoulders to form the next level of the pyramid.  

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    ...Right next to the cheerleaders. 

      Marty aims an imaginary bow and arrow at the pyramid, which 
    is three cheerleaders high.  It s pretty damn impressive.  

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Okay, Patch.  Call it.

                                  DAN
                    Mmmm... Ponytail chick.  I want her 
                    head above my mantel.

                                  MARTY
                    You want her head in your lap.           "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           5.


                                  DAN
                          (mock shock)
                    Marty.  My delicate sensibilities.

                                  MARTY
                    Do not actually exist.

      Marty lets fly with her imaginary arrow.

    The pony-tailed cheerleader, Alice, shoulderstands, 
      completing the pyramid.  Suddenly, she SLIPS --  

    -- creating the illusion that Marty s  arrow  has just 
      toppled the pyramid.  Which has just happened. 

      Marty gasps.  Dan and the slacker dudes bust a gut laughing 
    as the surprised Hellcats extricate themselves from an 
      unseemly tangle of well-toned arms and legs.

                                  DAN
                    Marty shot the cheerleaders!  
                    Outstanding!  Who s next?  The 
                    mayor?  Can t shoot the president 
                    anymore, he s cool.

                                  MARTY
                    Knock it off.  That girl is hurt.

      Marty points.  Alice rolls on the ground, holding her arm, in 
      pain.  Dan shoves her playfully.

                                  DAN
                    Smile.  They re only cheerleaders.



    A modest row home, adjacent to campus.  Marty zips up on a 
      bike, chains it to the mailbox and grabs the mail.  She wears 
      ear-buds.  Ludacris s How Low  pounds from Marty s iPod.



      Marty bikes along the path, weaving expertly around 
      pedestrians.  She s a girl on a mission.  She pulls up to the 
      University Center, drops her bike and runs inside.



      Marty stands outside a video store with her bike, 
      deliberating, agonizing.  Making a decision, she enters...

      TIME CUT -- Marty emerges from the store, DVD in a bag.



    Big cross and a banner  HOME OF THE CYCLONES.  The CYCLONES, 
    a group of perfect white Christian cheerleaders in perfect 
      white uniforms practice routines.  They re more 
      conservatively dressed, way less sexy than the Hellcats, and 
      show zero ethnic diversity.  It s like watching the Osmonds 
    in their heyday.  Their guys are huge, way more powerful than 
    the Luis, Wedge and the Hellcat bases we ve seen in action.     

      REVEAL THE WEDGE

      She s on the sidelines, surreptitiously videotaping the 
      rehearsal.  A SECURITY GUARD hurries up.

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    What are you doing?  

    He grabs her camera, takes out the tape.

                                  WEDGE
                    I m sorry, sir.  Is there a policy?

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Cheerleaders come from other 
                    schools, steal routines.

                                  WEDGE
                    Are you making fun of me? Does this 
                    look like a cheerleader s body?  

    She slaps her butt, making the guard uncomfortable.

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Oh, I didn t mean anything by it.

                                  WEDGE
                    I just wanted to get some footage 
                    of the Cyclones to show at our 
                    potluck this Sunday.  All the girls 
                    at my church are huge fans. 
                          (pointsto cheerleaders)
                    See Donny?  One there at the end?  
                    He s so cute.  I would totally
                    abstain from having sex with him.

    She eyes the tape hopefully.  The guard sighs and returns it.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           19.


                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Go on.  Get out of here.

                                  WEDGE
                    Thank you, sir!

      Wedge runs off, smiling to herself.  Sucker.



    A sign:  HELLCAT TRYOUTS TODAY.   

      Nervous HOPEFULS sit in the bleachers, waiting for their turn 
    to try out.  Each has a big numbered sticker on their back so 
    the judges can take notes.

      Alice and Sierra are seated, the judges.  Luis, Wedge and 
      some ND HELLCATS are in position.  Vanessa addresses the 
      hopefuls.

                                  VANESSA
                    I am Coach Vanessa Hodge.  At the 
                    table is cheer captain Sierra Sloan 
                    and her secondary Alice Vandemark. 
                    We need flyers for airborne stunts, 
                    so I hope you brought your A-game.  
                    You ve had a chance to run the 
                    routine, so let s see who among you 
                    has what it takes to be a Hellcat!

    The hopefuls jump up, cheering and whooping, lousy with 
      ersatz spirit.  More laid back is

      MARTY -- at the top of the bleachers with Dan.  She s dressed 
    in Converse sneaks, sweats and a  HOME TAPING IS KILLING 
      MUSIC  T-shirt.  She wears a sign identifying her as  #26. 

      Marty rises to join the other hopefuls.

                                  DAN
                    You realize this is insane.  

                                  MARTY
                    Painfully aware, thank you.  

      Luis calls up to Marty.  

                                  LUIS
                    Move, #26! Stragglers will be shot!

      He s smiling, so it s okay.  Marty heads down.          "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           21.


                                  DAN
                    Don t trip, #26!

      Marty ignores him.  Dan laughs.

      ANGLE ON JUDGE TABLE

      Marty passes Sierra.  Both girls recognize one another.

                                  MARTY
                    Oh God, you re a judge.

                                  SIERRA
                          (cold)
                    Captain, actually.  Good luck.

      Luis ushers the stunned Marty.  

                                  LUIS
                    C mon, 26, take your place.

      Marty takes her position, presumably doomed.  

                                  ALICE
                    You know that one? 

                                  SIERRA
                    I tried to slap her yesterday.  She 
                    has fast hands.

    As the girls gather on the mat and space themselves out, 
      Vanessa flips on Lady Gaga s JUST DANCE.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Five, six, seven, eight!

    The hopeful cheerleaders move in unison to the music.  

      Girls HANDSPRING backwards across the mats, flashing blinding 
      white teeth, smiling like their lives depended on it.  

      Heads bob mechanically, arms SHOOT up in V-formation.  They 
      bound off the mat and straddle their legs in a TOE TOUCH 
      JUMP, then land in a tucked position.

      TIGHTER SHOTS on individual girls.  Some are good, some not.  
    One looks like a stripper.  One is great but appears to be 
    12.  One has a great body, hideous face.  More than one girl 
      falls on her ass.  One aspiring flyer appears to be a dude.  
      Sierra, Vanessa and Alice react like  American Idol  judges.  

                                  ALICE
                    Someone put 11 out of my misery.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           22.


                                  VANESSA
                    Oh, I can t watch this.  

                                  SIERRA
                    Is that... an adam sapple?

      While the group shake their hips and glide two steps to the 
      RIGHT, Marty glides to the LEFT and COLLIDES with another 
      girl.  Shit.She struggles to regain her footing.    

    The girls take two steps forward for another TOE TOUCH.  But 
      Marty is a half step late.  Her rhythm thrown off.  

                                  ALICE 
                    Don t worry about 26.  She s toast. 

    But Vanessa s had her eye on Marty, too.  She s not so quick 
    to dismiss her potential.  She shouts -- 

                                  VANESSA
                    26!  Relax!  Count it out.  

      Marty picks the steps up and is back in the line with the 
      others.  But three counts later, she steps RIGHT, when she 
      should step LEFT.  Alice and Sierra exchange scornful looks.

                                  ALICE
                    Hopeless.  

    IN THE BLEACHERS -- Dan buries his head in his hands.  Yikes.

                                  VANESSA
                    Chill, 26!  Just have fun!

      Marty pauses for a beat.  A deep breath, then...

      Suddenly, she s doing her own thing.  A mash-up of styles: 
    she ISOLATES and POPS her chest and shoulders in the style of 
      krumping, she LEAPS into the air, legs aloft, graceful as 
      anything George Balanchineever staged. 

                                  ALICE 
                    What the hell is she doing?

                                  VANESSA
                    She s dancing.

                                  SIERRA
                    That is not what we do.

                                  VANESSA
                    No.  It is not.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           23.


      Marty does a PERFECT PIROUETTE, then CRASHES into a gutsy 
      break-dance move: a one ARMED PIKE FREEZE - both legs 
      suspended in air, parallel to the ground.  One hand supports 
    her body weight, free hand reaching out toward her toes.   

      Marty s body is FROZEN for a few beats as she waits for the 
      judges to pick their jaws off the floor.  Marty bends her 
      knees and KICKS OUT, propels herself upright to standing.  

                                  ALICE
                    She doesn t know the choreography.  

    But Vanessa is riveted.  Marty s dangerous, sexy performance 
    is intense -- more  top model  than zippy cheerleader.

                                  SIERRA
                    And what s with the facials?  She s 
                    not smiling, she doesn t look 
                    happy.  A cheerleader never pouts.

    A switch has flipped inside Marty.  She executes a perfect 
      tumbling pass: ROUND OFF, BACK HANDSPRING, BACK FLIP.  

      Luis leaps out of his seat and cheers -- that rocked!

                                  LUIS
                    Yeah!

      Propelled by her body s momentum, Marty finishes off with a 
    360 DEGREE TWISTING ROTATION (known as a  full  in cheer 
      parlance) in the air, legs straight as a metal rod.  She 
      lands effortlessly.     

                                  SIERRA
                    Oh my god.  Did she just do a Full?  
                    It took me six months to hit that.  

      Alice purses her lips, unimpressed.  

                                  ALICE
                    Well, that s you.

    The routine wraps up and the girls jump in the air, land on 
    the mat with a loud THUD in SPLITS.  Marty looks around, 
      realizes she s behind, JUMPS and also lands in line, in 
      perfect splits.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Nice work.  Take a breather.  

    The group dissipates.  Marty passes Luis.  

                                  LUIS
                    Where dyou pick up those moves?        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           24.


                                  MARTY
                    Townie bars.  Been going since I 
                    was sixteen.  We close down 
                    Republic every Saturday night.

      Marty shoots a look at Vanessa, Sierra and Alice conferring.  
    She looks like she s gonnabe sick. 

                                  MARTY (CONT'D)
                    So, Captain Blondieover there --?

                                  LUIS
                    Sierra.

                                  MARTY
                    Can the other two outvote her?

                                  LUIS
                    I guess.  Why?  

                                  MARTY
                    No reason.  

                                  LUIS
                    I know she nearly crappedherself 
                    when you landed the Full.  

                                  MARTY
                    Landed the what?  

                                  LUIS
                    Mami, you are green. 

      From high above, Dan watches the muscle-bound cheer-jock 
      flirt with Marty.  He s not thrilled.

      JUDGE S TABLE

      They go through the list and compare notes.

                                  VANESSA
                    Next is #26.  

                                  ALICE
                    No way.   

                                  VANESSA
                    I like the crazy dancing thing.  

                                  ALICE
                    It s weird.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           25.


                                  VANESSA
                    It s different.  We need to mix it 
                    up or Southern kills us at 
                      qualifiers.  Sierra?

      Sierra doesn t answer.

                                  ALICE
                    Hello, Sierra?

    Off Sierra s indecision...



      Fraternity row.  A hopping scene, good-looking young people 
      socializing, looking to hook up and avoid their studies.

      Wanda s car is parked by one of the houses.  Marty pulls bags 
      from the trunk.  A sign identifies the building as  BARKER 
      HOUSE,  but someone (maybe Sierra) has neatly painted the 
      nickname  CHEERTOWN  above the official name.  

                                  WANDA
                     Cheertown?   

                                  MARTY
                    They force all the cheerleaders to 
                    live here.  It supposedly promotes 
                    spirit.  Rah.

                                  WANDA
                    Well, it seems a waste when our 
                    house is barely off-campus.  

                                  MARTY
                    It keeps me in school.  Do you 
                    understand how close I came to 
                    having to drop out?  The position 
                    you put me in?        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           28.


      Wanda ignores the confrontational tone.  We re starting to 
    get the sense she does this willfully.

                                  WANDA
                    What s important is it all worked 
                    out.  I told you there was no 
                    reason to worry.   

      Marty bites her tongue.  Why start a fight?

                                  WANDA (CONT D)
                    What do you say we celebrate?  
                    We ll drop off your stuff, go out 
                    for ribs, find some guys to buy us 
                    drinks...?  

                                  MARTY
                    After we drop off this stuff, I 
                    have to actually unpack it.  And 
                    get sleep.  Because I have three 
                    hours of classes and three hours of 
                        cheerleadingrehearsal tomorrow.  

                                  WANDA
                    I think they call it practice.

                                  MARTY
                    Whatever they call it, it s going 
                    to kick my ass.  I m still sore 
                    from the audition.  
                          (beforeMom corrects her)
                    Tryout.

                                  WANDA
                    I miss you already.  

    Now Mom s getting weepy.  Perfect. 

                                  MARTY
                    You work on campus.  I see you 
                    every day.  Whereas I am facing a 
                    house full of alien cheerleaders. 
                    If they don t accept me, I ll get 
                    cut from the squad, lose my new 
                      scholarship and end up working the 
                    grease gun at Jiffy Lube. 

                                  WANDA
                    Marty the martyr...

                                  MARTY
                    Yes, I love it when you call me 
                    that.

                                  MARTY (CONT'D)
                    Now if you ll excuse me I have to 
                    go bond or instigate a pillow fight 
                    or something.  I love you, good 
                    night.

      Marty picks up her bags.

                                  WANDA
                    Can I come meet your new friends?

                                  MARTY
                    Good night!

      Marty heads up to the front porch.



      Marty eats takeout with Dan under the bleachers.

                                  DAN
                    So we gonnahit Republic tonight?

                                  MARTY
                    Practice, exam, second exam, more 
                    practice.  You re gonnahave to 
                    seduce Rosalie without me.  

                                  DAN
                    Rosalie s not my type. 

                                  MARTY
                    Your type is a girl who says, 
                     Sure, Dan, I ll sleep with you.   

                                  DAN
                          (shrugs sheepishly)
                    Okay, that s a little true.

                                  MARTY
                    More than a little.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           36.


      Across the field, the Hellcats assemble.  Time for practice.  
      Marty doffs her bomber jacket to reveal a workout sports bra 
    and shorts.  Dan mock-recoils from Marty s exposed rack.  

                                  DAN
                    Jeez, come on, put those things 
                    away.  Are we cheering or hooking?  

                                  MARTY
                    A little of both, actually.  Time 
                    to start earning that scholarship.

    She shoves her jacket into her bag.  

                                  DAN
                    You sure college is worth all this? 

                                  MARTY
                    I m going to graduate, pass the bar 
                    up North and work in a DA s office 
                    where everybody talks in flat 
                    Yankee vowels.

                                  DAN
                    C mon, how can you leave Memphis?

                                  MARTY
                    Mom.  Lives.  Here.  

                                  DAN
                    I live here too.  That s gotta 
                    count for something, right?

    He says it very casually, but we see him search her for a 
      reaction.  She doesn t give up anything.  

                                  MARTY
                    If I were gonnastay for something, 
                    I d stay for the ribs.

                                  DAN
                    Oh, you did not.

      They both laugh.  Clearly, banter is safer.  Marty fist bumps 
    Dan and runs off to join the Hellcats.  Dan watches 
      thoughtfully, bitter-sweetly.  

      FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT THREE        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           37.


                                          ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:



    The guys (and the Wedge) work on tossing the flyers into the 
    air and catching them in a cradle hold.  

      Marty hustles up to Sierra and Vanessa.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Marty.  With Alice out, you and 
                    Sierra are my first-string fliers.

                                  MARTY
                    What does that mean?

                                  VANESSA
                    It means you ve got a ton of work 
                    to do between now and qualifiers 
                    this weekend.  It ll be hard, but 
                    we ll get you there.  Sierra will 
                    show you the fight song, which is a 
                    basic 16 count combo.  You ll do it 
                    thirty times in any given event, so 
                    memorize it.  

      Marty nods.  Sierra locks her body into place.  

                                  SIERRA
                    Start legs hip width apart.  
                          (shouting)
                    And GO BIG GREEN!  EVERYBODY SAY GO 
                    BIG GREEN!

                                  VANESSA
                    So it s: arms low V. Clap.  Arms 
                    high V.  Touch left, hip, hip.

      Marty follows the basic foot and armwork. 

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    Good.  Now step it up, put some 
                    real energy into it.  Power!    

      Marty moves with Sierra.  Arms snapping, hips popping. 

                                  SIERRA
                    GO BIG GREEN.  EVERYBODY SAY GO BIG 
                    GREEN!        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           38.


                                  VANESSA
                    POWER!  I wanna hear you, Marty!  

                                  MARTY
                    Go big green. Everybody say go big 
                    green!  

                                  VANESSA
                    Like you mean it!  You love this!

                                  MARTY
                          (a mighty bellow)
                    GO BIG GREEN!!!  

                                  VANESSA 
                    You ll get it.  Practice in the 
                    mirror, in your car.  LOUD.    
                          (a beat, then)
                    Moving on.  Hit your hip one, tuck 
                    two, kick three... 

      Vanessa and Sierra do a HIGH KICK that ruffles hair.   

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    ...touch four, wind it up five, toe 
                    touch six... 

    A JUMP that seems to defy gravity.

                                  VANESSA (CONT D)
                    ...land seven, clean it up eight.  

      Bodies rigid, stiff and flawless.  

      Marty follows along, does the combo once.  She gets it, but 
    her body flows a more naturally to the steps, less rigid.    

      Shakira s Give It Up to Me  kicks in.  QUICK MONTAGE CUTS:  
      Marty and Sierra go through the 16 counts dozens of times...  

    -  Marty s style rears away from stiff cheer-style and into 
      funkier, more stylistic dance.  Sierra reacts, appalled.  

    -  Vanessa is getting into it, joins them.  After a half-
      dozen or so times running through the routine, she starts to 
    put a little more GROOVE into her hips, more SHAKE into her 
      booty.  She and Marty smile at one another, this is fun.     

    -  Sierra executes the routine precisely the same each and 
      every time, not one errant hip or flick of her hair.  Vanessa 
      stops Sierra.  Way too white.  She motions for Marty to show 
      Sierra the move.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           39.


    -  Marty puts her hand on Sierra s hips to show her the new 
      moves.  Vanessa joins.  Sierra, Marty, and Vanessa do the 
      combo.  Sierra smiles, starting to get into it.Now all 
      three are pretty funkified.

    -  Now the other Hellcats have joined in.  We re seeing the 
    two styles mesh -- Marty s odd moves with the vocabulary of 
      traditional cheer.  It s awesome, hot and sexy.  Feels almost 
      like a dance production number.  As the song wraps up, Marty 
      punctuates the combination with an impressive BACK FLIP.  

                                  MARTY
                    WOO!

                                  VANESSA
                    Nice work.  Very nice.  

      Marty glances to see if Dan saw how cool that was.  She s 
      disappointed to see he s no longer there.  In his place, 

      COACH RED IRVINE

    Now watches practice.  He grumbles to a nearby Bill Curran.  

                                  RED
                    What the hell is Vanessa teaching 
                    these girls?  She s got  em dancing 
                    like goddamnstrippers.  

                                  CURRAN
                          (appreciative)
                    She sure does.  



    A HELLCAT FALLS THROUGH FRAME IN SLOW-MO to eerie beautiful 
      music like SigurRos  Festival.   Graceful, hair and skirt 
      billowing as she executes a perfect PRETTY GIRL DISMOUNT. 
      After a beat, she flies back into frame and pulls her leg 
      behind her to a standing SCORPION.

      Normal speed resumes and we CUT WIDE.  

      This is a fear-busting exercise.  A line of Hellcats are 
      positioned at the very top of the bleachers, about thirty 
      feet in the air.  One by one, they take a leap of faith into 
    the waiting arms of a team of bases waiting below with a 
      trampoline (Wedge, Luis, Darwin, ND-base).   

    The Hellcat hits the trampoline a second time, flips 
      elegantly into the air and lands gracefully on the grass.         "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           42.


      SERIES OF SHOTS:  All the girls take a turn jumping, twisting 
    and spinning.  It looks scary and fun at the same time. 

    TOP OF BLEACHERS

    Now it s Marty s turn.  She stands atop the bleachers, alone 
      with Sierra.  Marty hesitates, afraid to jump.

      ANGLE ON VANESSA

    She calls up with a bullhorn.  

                                  VANESSA
                    Remember, positive outcomes only, 
                    so smile!  Your team will never let 
                    you hit ground! 
                          (sotto to bases)
                    Drop her and I ll kill you slow.

    But Luis exudes easy rock star confidence...

                                  LUIS
                    I got her.

      BACK TO MARTY AND SIERRA

      Marty is poised to jump, but can t bring herself to do it.

                                  MARTY
                    Sierra, I can t.   

                                  SIERRA
                    You heard Vanessa.  Trust your 
                    team.  Can you do that, Marty?  Can 
                    you trust us?

      Marty bites her lip, turns back to look at the drop.

                                  MARTY
                    This was a mistake.  Alice was 
                    right -- 

                                  SIERRA
                    Oh, screw Alice.

      Without warning, Sierra gives Marty a little push.  Marty 
      teeters a beat -- 

                                  MARTY
                    Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

    And goes falling into space!

      DOWN BELOW -- The guys hustle to catch the flailing Marty.        "CHEER" - MURPHY  - NETWORK REV 3 - 12/23/09           43.


      WHAM!Marty hits the trampoline feet first and bounces high 
    and off-center.  Luis catches Marty in his powerful arms.  

    A moment.  The two lock eyes.  There s real chemistry here.

                                  LUIS
                    You okay?

      Marty s face goes from utter shock to a wide grin.

                                  MARTY
                    That... was FREAKING AWESOME!!!

    The Hellcats celebrate this small milestone.  All, except 
      Alice, watching Marty in the arms of her ex.
