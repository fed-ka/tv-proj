      Kalinda starts toward her car.  Sees Muller leaning against 
    it.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Hey, Muller, what s up?

    But Muller just passes her, starts off.  That s odd.  Kalinda 
      considers it, sees her driver-side window open just an inch.  

      Uh-oh.  She carefully opens her car door, finds...

      ...a manila folder there.  Oh.  She opens it.  A xeroxed SIX-
      PACK PHOTO ARRAY.  Clarence and five other black men.  
      Kalinda studies it, and immediately swears under her breath.  


      --Will, Alicia, Cary, Bree, all on cellphones, talk over each 
      other on the courthouse steps, all phoning witnesses: just 
      glimpses of conversations here and there  I know we said 
      tomorrow, sir--    How long will you be in Baltimore--?   
       Can you please give us call with an ETA--?   But-- Bree 
      raises a hand, yells out:

                                  BREE
                    Got one!  
                          (but...)
                    Two hours away. 

      Damn.  Meanwhile, Kalinda comes up to Alicia...

                                  KALINDA
                    We need to talk.

                                  ALICIA
                    We re short a witness.

      Kalinda pulls Alicia aside.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Remember what I said about visiting 
                    your husband?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

                                  KALINDA
                    Well, I know you like obsessing 
                    over the ethical niceties...
                    Illinois Court ruling 1.6 
                    subsection c.An attorney may use 
                    leaked information, just not-- 

                                  ALICIA
                    Kalinda, there s no need.  Peter *
                    has nothing on this case.

                                  KALINDA
                    He does.

                                  ALICIA
                    How do you know?

      Kalinda pauses only a second: some part of her screaming 
       this is a bad idea,  but...

                                  KALINDA
                    I saw him.

      Alicia stares at her.  She might as well have said she saw a 
      martian.

                                  ALICIA
                    You saw him?  You saw Peter?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes.

                                  ALICIA
                    You saw my husband in prison?

                                  KALINDA
                    I used to work for him.  I told 
                    you.

                                  ALICIA
                    How often do you visit my husband 
                    in prison?

                                  KALINDA
                    Come on.  Don t go there.*

                                  ALICIA
                    Why not?

                                  KALINDA
                    Because... it s not pertinent.  And 
                    it s not true!

      Alicia considers it.  Angry now.  She turns to Kalinda.  With 
      quiet venom...

                                  ALICIA
                    Don t... visit my husband in prison.

      Kalinda stares at her, starts to respond.  Hesitates.  Then:

                                  KALINDA
                    Then youvisit him.  You want to 
                    help Clarence, go visit him.

    But Alicia walks away, disgusted.  Everywhere she fuckin  
      turns is her husband.


      A small cottage in the shade of the prison.

                    ...There is no outside 
                    intervention... However... 


    The police sketch we saw earlier of the robber.  An older 
      ASIAN OWNER of a liquor store shakes her head, studying it.

                                  KALINDA
                    You re sure?

    The woman now nods.  Kalinda and Cary stand with her on the 
      front door of her liquor store... 

                                  CARY
                    The thing is, Mrs...

    He waits for her to add her name.  She doesn t.  Kalinda 
      smiles.

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    ...you phoned the cops about an 
                    armed robbery a week after the one 
                    we re investigating.  And we thought 
                    it might be the same suspect because 
                    you re only two blocks away... 
                          (finishing)
                    ...from the other.

    The Owner looks toward Kalinda who smiles apologetically...

                                  KALINDA
                    The suspect, was he possibly 
                    wearing a Bulls sweatshirt?
                          (the owner shakes her 
                          head)
                    Well, thank you.

      Cary and Kalinda start away...

                                  CARY
                    So this is kind of cool.  Kind of

      Kalinda laughs despite herself.  Takes out a map, covered 
      with red dots.

                                  KALINDA
                    Okay, so here s the plan.  We look 
                    for armed robberies afterClarence 
                    Wilcox was arrested, and see if any 
                    match this sketch.
                          (the police sketch)
                      That llgive us another suspect in 
                    court, okay?  We ll split up the 
                      interviews.  

    She rips the map down the middle, hands one half to Cary.

                                  CARY
                    How long you been working at Stern,

                    Ask them about the MO, the Bulls 
                      sweatshirt.  Any description that s 
                    remotely similar to Clarence.

                    What dI do?

                                  KALINDA
                      Uninterested.

                    How much would you imagine we have

      Kalinda studies him.

                    Okay.  You just saved Clarence 
                    Wilcox s life.

      Kalinda laughs.  Cary starts off.  Kalinda calls after him:

                                  KALINDA
                    Cary.  

    He smiles, comes back, takes the artist sketch too.  Starts 
    off again.
