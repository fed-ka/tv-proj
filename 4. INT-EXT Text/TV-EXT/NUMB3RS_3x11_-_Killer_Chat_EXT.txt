  FROM POV OF A HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA from inside the house... 
  A car pulls up.  JOHN SANTOS, 30, Latino, dress shirt (no 
  tie), slacks, cellphone on belt (think Radio Shack manager), 
  gets out, a six-pack of beer under his arm.  He walks across 
  the lawn, circles around to the back door... 

  NOW FROM POV OF  DATELINE -style fixed surveillance video 
    cameras... we see Santos enter.  HEAVY METAL ON THE STEREO.  
  Santos moves through the house, looking around.

                              JOHN SANTOS
                Hey.  It s John.  You here...?

  No answer.  He spies a note on the fridge tacked up by a 
  magnet:   Chill out.  I m in the shower.   Santos smiles.  He 
  notices steam coming from under the bathroom door down the 
  hall, hears the shower.  He pops a beer, calls toward the 
  bathroom:

                              JOHN SANTOS (cont'd)
                You want some company?

  He starts to unbutton his shirt, move toward the bathroom.  A 
  SHADOW falls across the floor.  He turns.  TRANSITIONING NOW 
  TO OBJECTIVE FILM POV... A BASEBALL BAT comes at him.  It 
  clocks him, sends him to the carpet, unconscious...  HANDS IN 
  HEAVY GLOVES duct-tape his legs, drag him to a CHAIR. CUT TO: 


  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER: FIND Don, David, Colby on the move.

                              COLBY
                This guy s definitely got his own 
                  playbook.  Most serial killers 
                stalk their victims or take them 
                home to do the deed.

                              DAVID
                But he s doing neither.  He lures 
                them to these houses. 

                              DON
                Which means our killer doesn t just 
                have access to houses for sale.  He 
                has access to information.

                              COLBY
                ...He knows which houses are empty.  
                And when.

                              DAVID
                Sounds like we re looking for a real 
                estate agent, maybe a contractor.

                Bank records show right before the 
                murders all three victims withdrew 
                money from an ATM.

                              DAVID
                Maybe he s baiting them -- drugs?

                              CHARLIE
                You said you wanted to see me 
                safely launched into the academic 
                  firmament.  Now it s my turn.

                              LARRY
                      (beat; emotional)
                Just so you know...  Letting go is 
                always harder on the mentor than it 
                is on the student.


  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER: Don, Megan and David...

                              DAVID
                We checked Elaine Tillman s e-mail.  
                Over the past three months she s 
                  contacted a half-dozen real estate 
                  agencies.

                              MEGAN
                She said she and her husband were 
                looking to buy a bigger house...

                              DAVID
                She used different names to contact 
                the real estate agents, make the 
                  appointments.

                              DON 
                Where is she now?

                              DAVID 
                Two hours ago, she left her kids at a 
                  neighbor s.  Said her mom was sick, 
                she had to take her to the hospital.

                              MEGAN
                ...She s lined up her next victim.

                              DON
                      (beat, working the facts)
                These listings you found in her e-
                mail... how many houses were there?

                              DAVID
                Almost a hundred.

                              DON
                Let s get the list to Charlie.


  TWO SUV s pull up behind an ND STATION WAGON.  Megan and 
  David jump out, checking out the ND STATION WAGON --

                              DAVID
                LAPD spotted Elaine Tillman s car.  
                House is around the corner -- 2152 
                  Floresta...

                              MEGAN
                LAPD has the perimeter?
                      (off David s nod)
                Alright.  We go in quiet.


  Larry and Megan at the door.  A pregnant pause, then...

                              MEGAN
                Well, I guess the next time I see 
                you, you ll be in a space suit--

  Larry puts his fingers to her lips, hushing her...

                              LARRY
                Shhhh...
                      (beat)
                Newton had his apple.  But it took  *
                you falling into my life to make me  *
                see the world anew.  In your eyes,  *
                I become new.  How we see ourselves  *
                changes how we see the world.  Even 
                from space.  *

  He leans in and kisses her.  Megan fights back tears...

                              MEGAN
                Just be careful.

                              LARRY
                      (nods, then)
                I have to go.  Someone s waiting.

  Larry looks toward a FIGURE standing on the Bridge...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)NUMB3RS   #311/48   "Killer Chat"  BUFF REV  11-08-06     58.

                              MEGAN
                Is that Buzz Aldrin?

                              LARRY
                I think NASA s afraid I d get lost.

  Megan smiles.  Larry turns and crosses to BUZZ ALDRIN. CLOSE 
  ON LARRY AND BUZZ ALDRIN walking TO CAMERA IN SLO-MO.  Think 
   The Right Stuff.   WE HEAR A VOICE:

                                COUNTDOWN VOICE
                T-minus one minute to launch...
