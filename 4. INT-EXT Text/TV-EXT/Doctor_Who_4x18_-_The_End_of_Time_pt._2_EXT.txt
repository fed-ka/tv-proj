                    Well then.  You shouldn't have
                    married me.

      And Martha Smith-Jones moves round, next to Mickey.

      CUT TO POV from high-up inside the factory.  SONTARAN POV,
      the hairlines of a gun.  Targeting:

      Martha & Mickey together, down below.  They're not looking
      this way, talking, in hiding, reckoning that the Sontaran
      is in a completely different direction.

      REVERSE on the Sontaran, with his gun.  COMMANDER JASK.

      He readies his weapon.

      Rifle POV.  Target zooming in on Martha. 

      Her forehead.

                  The 
      Jask licking his lips.  About to fire...

      Bonk!

      Jask blinks.  Then falls down out of frame, unconscious.

      Behind him, THE DOCTOR.  With a mallet.

      CUT BACK TO Mickey and Martha, consulting a blueprint.

                                      MICKEY
                    Cos I think, if we go in here, get
                    to the factory floor, down that
                    corridor, he won't know we're there -

      She's looking up, he follows her eyeline.

      Far above, full-length, the Doctor is looking down at them.

      Hold the moment.  They look at him.  He looks at them.

      Then the Doctor walks back into darkness, gone.

      They stay staring up.  The noise of the Tardis fills the
      air.  And somehow, they just know he was saying goodbye.

                                      MICKEY
                    Hey.

      Pulling Martha to him.  Together.  Both so sad.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Mr Smith to put out this story,
                    saying that wi-fi went mad, all
                    across the world, giving everyone
                      hallucinations!  I mean, how else
                    are you going to explain it? 
                    Everyone with a different face!

      He's laughing away, crossing the road - not looking -

                    But it's you!  You're..!

      But the Doctor just walks away.  Fast.

      Luke goes belting towards 13 Bannerman Road -

                    Mum!  Mum - !

      SARAH JANE comes running round the corner, almost colliding -

      And she looks down the street.

      The TARDIS a long way off.  The Doctor a distant figure. 
      But he stops at the door. 

      Looks at her.  Gives a single wave.  Then steps inside.

      On Sarah Jane & Luke; sound of the Tardis fills the air.

      And Sarah Jane is crying. 

      Because she knows.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      confetti as the Bride and Groom, DONNA and SHAUN TEMPLE-
      NOBLE come out of a perfect springtime picture-book church.

      She's never been so happy.  The biggest smile!

      CUT TO WILF & SYLVIA, standing a distance back, in all
      their finery, smiling.  MINNIE's there too, all saucy.

                    Dad.

      Wilf looks.

      Far away, outside the church: THE DOCTOR, and the TARDIS.

      JUMP CUT TO Wilf & Sylvia, hurrying up to the Doctor.

                                    WILF
                    There now, same old face.  Didn't

                    There's one thing you never told
                    me.  That woman.  Who was she?

      The Doctor just looks.  At Wilf.  At Sylvia.  At Donna, in
      the distance.  Friends, mothers, brides. 

      He's not saying.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just wanted to give you this.
                                  Writer's 

      He hands Wilf an envelope.

                    back in time, borrowed a quid off
                    a really lovely man.  Geoffrey
                    Noble, his name was.  Have it, he
                    said.  Have that on me.

      On Wilf and Sylvia.  Overwhelmed.

      JUMP CUT TO Wilf, a little shaken, back inside the
      churchyard with Donna & guests, handing her the envelope -

                                      DONNA

      But stay on Wilf, with Sylvia.  Both knowing what this
      means.  Both overjoyed.  And staring to cry.

      They look across.

      The Doctor, and the Tardis.   

      He turns and goes.

      Wilfred, crying, with confetti in the air, salutes him.

      Snow.  Falling through the air.  Against black.

      Coming down to find the ground-floor courtyard, covered in
      snow.  A bell is tolling in the distance.  Midnight.
                                                          Tale

      No one around except a girl and her mother, walking along

                    I'm late now, I missed it, it's

                    me everything.  That's your fault!

                    Oh, don't be like that.  You never

      And Rose walks on, alone.

      A good distance away, watching, from the shadows.  THE
      DOCTOR.  Silent.  In the snow.  His face in darkness.

      She doesn't even see him, just walking on by...

      But then he winces.  Pain.  Can't help gasping, ow!

      She stops.  Looks across.  A bit wary, keeps her distance.

                                    ROSE
                    You all right, mate?

                    Something like that.

                                    ROSE
                    Maybe it's time you went home.

                    Anyway.  Happy new year.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And you.

      She's about to turn and go, but -

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    What year is this?

                                    ROSE
                    Blimey, how much did you have? 
                    It's 2005.  January the first.

                    See ya.

      And Rose Tyler walks away, to the future.

      The Doctor is left alone.

      He turns, starts to walk.

      In the distance: the TARDIS.

      As he walks, he loses the pretence.  He's in so much pain. 
      Dragging his feet.  Every step.

      He winces, sharp pain, ow!

      Tries to keep going.  The longest walk.

      Walking through the snow.

      Then it really hits him.  Agony.  He falls to his knees. 
                                                          Tale
      desperate.  And so alone.

      He heaves for breath.  Can't find the strength.

      He could die, right here.

      But then...

      A song.

      A familiar song.  Drifting in through the night.
                                  Writer's 

      The Song of the Ood.

      The Doctor looks up.

                  The 
      Standing far away, in the snow.  OOD SIGMA.

      The song is rising, now, soaring.

      The Doctor gaining strength from it.

                                    OOD SIGMA
                    We will sing to you, Doctor.  The
                    universe will sing you to your
                    sleep.

      And the Doctor...

      Stands.

      The song all around him.  Inspiring him.

                    This song is ending.  But the story
                    never ends.

      And the Doctor keeps walking. 

      To the Tardis.

                                                                            CUT TO:
