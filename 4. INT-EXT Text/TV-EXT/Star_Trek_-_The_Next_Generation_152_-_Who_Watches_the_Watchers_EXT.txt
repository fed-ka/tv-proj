   We are en route to Mintaka Three, 
   where a three-man Federation 
   anthropological field team has 
   been studying the inhabitants. 
 
 
 A hillside with sheer rock walls and outcroppings. 
 About three meters up a nearly sheer rockface is a 
 narrow path. A large section of the rockface above the 
 path SHIMMERS and FADES AWAY -- revealing the exterior 
 ported wall of the "duck blind" (the interior of which 
 is built inside the rockface). BLUE SPARKS dance 
 about the metal structure of the duck blind. 
 
 
 Palmer has fallen clear of the duck blind. Dazed and 
 disoriented, he makes his way down the path and EXITS 
 the area.

 FADE IN: 
 
 
 in orbit around Mintaka Three. 
 
 
 Two Mintakans -- middle-aged LIKO and his teenaged 
 daughter OJI -- are walking. Mintakans look very 
 similar to Vulcans -- they have the same pointed ears 
 and arched eyebrows. Note: Though Mintakans are a 
 cool-headed, rational people, they are not as stoic and 
 emotionless as Vulcans. 
 
     LIKO 
   Why did we have to come so early? 
 
     OJI 
   When the sun reaches its zenith, 
   I have to be ready to take the 
   measurements. 
 
     LIKO 
    (amused) 
   You'll be ready. You've read 
   the sundial hundreds of times.

     OJI 
   Yes, father -- but never as the 
   appointed recordkeeper. 
 
     LIKO 
    (smiles) 
   You're taking your duties quite 
   seriously. Your mother would have 
   been proud of you. 
 
 
 Liko and Oji ENTER the area, which is presently 
 unoccupied. Outside the "assembly hall" is a large 
 bronze sundial/astrolabe. Oji steps up to the 
 astrolabe, takes a preliminary sighting. In doing so, 
 she notices something o.s.: 
 
9    REVERSE ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 
 On a distant hillside, the exterior of the duck blind 
 is visible. Oji points it out to Liko: 
 
     OJI 
   What is that? 
 
     LIKO 
   I don't know... 
 
 Curious, they quickly head off toward the hillside. 
 
 
 Liko and Oji ENTER the area around the duck blind and 
 stop in amazement. Liko gestures for Oji to stay 
 hidden as he cautiously approaches the path leading to 
 the duck blind. 
 
10B  WIDER ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 
 The medic working on Warren nods to Beverly -- ready. 
 Beverly taps her communicator: 
 
     BEVERLY 
   Enterprise -- beam Martinez and 
   his patient directly to Sickbay. 
 
 Warren and the medic attending her DEMATERIALIZE. Data 
 looks up: 
 
     DATA 
   Doctor -- 
 
 Beverly also looks up -- 
 
11   ANGLE ON THE PORT (OPTICAL) 
 
 Peeking in one of the ports is Liko -- stunned at the 
 sight of these strangers magically disappearing. 
 Curious, Liko pokes his head further into the port, and 
 places a hand on the metal frame. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


                                                                                                                       Converted to .pdf for pdfscreenplays.net      STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/11/89 - ACT ONE     7. 
 
11   CONTINUED: 
 
 A furious ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE ZAPS Liko; dazed and 
 disoriented, he stumbles back. 
 
 
 Liko has fallen away from the duck blind. He slips 
 off the narrow path, falls three meters, and lands hard 
 on a section of jagged rock, severely gashing his head. 
 He GROANS. 
 
13   ANGLE ON OJI 
 
 Oji is at the bottom of the path. She's about to come 
 to her father's aid, but holds back as she sees: 
 
14   ON BEVERLY (OPTICAL) 
 
 Beverly has already emerged from the duck blind and is 
 heading down the path to Liko's side. 
 
15   ANGLE ON LIKO (OPTICAL) 
 
 in intense pain. Beverly approaches, administers a 
 hypo. A moment later, Liko is out cold. Beverly 
 examines him, then touches her communicator: 
 
     BEVERLY 
   Crusher to Enterprise. Medical 
   emergency. Two to beam directly 
   to Sickbay. 
 
 Beverly and Liko DEMATERIALIZE. 
 
15A  ANGLE ON OJI 
 
 emerging from her hiding place and moving toward the 
 spot where her father disappeared. 
 
 
 As the camouflage unit kicks in, the duck blind 
 DISAPPEARS; the rockface is now, to all appearances, 
 solid rock. 
 
18   ANGLE ON OJI 
 
 gazing bewildered at the wall of rock. She's 
 overwhelmed by the inexplicable wonders she has 
 witnessed. 
 
         CUT TO: 
 
 
 in orbit around Mintaka Three. 
 
 
 Oji is atop a bluff, finishing her reconnaissance. No 
 luck. She returns to the duck blind rockface, touches 
 it once more. Nothing happens. The hologram 
 generator's doing its job; the rockface looks and feels 
 authentic. 
 
 
 In a location not visible from the duck blind area, the 
 sleeping body of Liko MATERIALIZES. Slowly, Liko 
 awakens. 
 
 
 as Oji starts to walk back down the path.

 Startled, Oji turns, looks about, tries to place which 
 direction the voice came from -- 
 
     OJI 
   Father? 
 
 
 as Liko sits up, examines himself. 
 
     LIKO 
   Here... 
 
 After a beat, Oji ENTERS, rushes to her father's side 
 -- and is amazed to see that her father's wounds have 
 disappeared. 
 
     OJI 
   I thought I'd never see you again. 
   When you and the woman vanished, 
   I was sure you were dead. 
 
     LIKO 
   I think I was... but I was brought 
   back to life. I awoke in an 
   incredible place -- and my wounds 
   were gone. I had been healed. 
 
     OJI 
   How is that possible? 
 
 Liko ponders this gravely. 
 
     LIKO 
   Long ago, our people believed in 
   beings with great powers. These 
   beings made the rains come, told 
   the sun when to rise, and caused 
   all life to be born, to grow, 
   to die. 
 
     OJI 
   But those are just tales -- old 
   superstitions.

     LIKO 
   Perhaps the beliefs of our 
   ancestors are true. Nothing else 
   can explain what's happened. 
    (a beat) 
   Everything's changed now, Oji. 
   We must tell the others... 
 
 On Liko's resolute expression, we:

     RIKER (V.O.) 
   First officer's log, Stardate 
   43125.3. Counselor Troi and I 
   are beaming down to Mintaka Three 
   to locate Doctor Palmer and 
   determine the extent of the 
   cultural contamination. 
 
 
 The same spot where Liko was beamed down. Riker and 
 Troi MATERIALIZE, along with two bundles of woven 
 cloth. 
 
 Riker and Troi have been made up as Mintakans, 
 complete with angled eyebrows and pointed ears. 
 They're wearing typical Mintakan garb: austere, 
 mannerly outfits of woven cloth. 
 
     RIKER (V.O.) 
   Doctor Crusher has temporarily 
   altered our features and skin 
   color. She's also implanted 
   subcutaneous communicators so that 
   any transmissions we receive will 
   be inaudible to the Mintakans. 
 
 Riker and Troi look around. No one's in sight. 
 
     RIKER 
   Riker to Enterprise -- do you 
   read? 
 
 Riker hears Data's com voice via direct bone 
 conduction, so it sounds unusually thin and faint: 
 
     DATA'S COM VOICE 
    (filtered) 
   Perfectly, Commander. I will be 
   monitoring you continuously.

 Riker and Troi pick up their bundles of woven cloth. 
 
     TROI 
   Mintakan emotions are quite 
   interesting. Like the Vulcans, 
   they have highly ordered minds... 
   A very sensible people. 
 
 They start to walk. Riker automatically takes the 
 lead. Troi stops him, moves in front of him. MOVE 
 with them as they walk. 
 
     TROI (cont'd) 
    (enjoying this) 
   For example, Mintakan women 
   precede their mates. It's a 
   signal to other women. 
 
     RIKER 
   "This man's taken; get your own?" 
 
     TROI 
   Not precisely... More like, "if 
   you want his services, I'm the 
   one to negotiate with." 
 
     RIKER 
   What kinds of "services?" 
 
     TROI 
   All kinds. 
 
     RIKER 
    (amused) 
   Ah. They are a sensible race. 
 
 Riker and Troi come around a rock formation and find 
 themselves on a path leading to the assembly hall area. 
 
 
 A few MINTAKANS are entering the area. Riker and Troi 
 ENTER and follow the Mintakans toward the assembly 
 hall.

 Troi leads Nuria, Liko, Oji, Hali, and the others off 
 toward the hills. 
 
 
 Nuria, Liko, Oji, Hali, and the others are following 
 Troi. Oji suddenly notices the sun's position, stops: 
 
     OJI 
   Father -- the sun's reaching its 
   zenith. If I don't go to measure... 
 
     LIKO 
   Go. 
 
 Oji turns around, rushes back the way she came.

 Riker is about to reach a path through the rocks

 Picard, wearing a sling on his arm, stands before the 
 rockface. (His wounded shoulder has been healed in 
 Sickbay.) 
 
 Above and behind Picard is the (camouflaged) rockface. 
 Gathered are Nuria, Liko, Oji, Hali, Fento, and several 
 other Mintakans. One of the children hands Picard 
 some woven cloth. Picard nods his appreciation, then 
 taps his communicator.
