      FADE IN:

      EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT 

      We float over the town at it s glittering best.  From the air 
      it sparkles.  The strip is packed, the sidewalks bustle with 
      hopes, dreams, and excitement.  We PAN DOWN and find 
      ourselves at THE HILTON hotel.  We hear LIVE MUSIC playing.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HILTON SHOWROOM - SAME TIME 

      A packed room of people all dressed up for a night out on the 
      town.  WAITRESS S crisscross the room with drink trays 
      hoisted in the air.  On stage a line of glamorous DANCERS in 
      glittery bodysuits and feather head dresses are dancing their 
      hearts out with perfect smiles plastered on their faces.  We 
      PUSH IN on the dancer in the middle, MICHELLE SIMMS, late 
      thirties, mile long legs, and clearly the best kicker in the 
      bunch.  They finish their routine, pose and freeze.

      ANGLE ON: THE DANCERS POINT OF VIEW

      From the wings A line of TOPLESS SHOWGIRLS stroll out in even 
      larger feather headdresses.  They take their places right in 
      front of the dancers blocking them completely.  (The topless 
      girls will be shot from the back, Michelle s P.O.V., so no 
      tits will be seen)  The audience applauds enthusiastically.  

      Michelle turns to the dancer next to her, THALIA.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Sure.  We dance out asses off for 
                    two hours and then five minutes 
                    from the end they walk out and 
                    stand there, and bring the house 
                    down.

                                  TALIA
                    I know.

                                  MICHELLE
                    That s all they do.  Twice a show,  
                    walk out and stand there.

                                  TALIA
                    And they get paid more.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (sighs)
                    And they get paid more.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    Great message we re sending to the 
                    girls of America.   Hey girls, 
                    forget about actually learning to 
                    do something, just take your top 
                    off and stand there. 

                                  TALIA
                    And you ll get paid more.

                                  MICHELLE
                    And it s not even about the face.  
                    It s all about boobs.  I mean half 
                    of them aren t even pretty.  

                                  TALIA
                    No one looks at the face when they 
                    can look at the boobs.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I mean, Mara over there looks like 
                    Moammar Gadhafi but who cares? 

                                  TALIA
                    She still gets paid more.

                                  MICHELLE
                    So so wrong.

      The curtain comes down.  Everybody breaks their poses.  
      Stagehands hand the topless girls white bathrobes to put on.

                                  TALIA
                    I d take my top off if I could.  
                    But I m flat as a board.  Maybe I 
                    should buy some.  I mean, how much 
                    could they be?  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Five to seven grand.

                                  TALIA
                    What?  No!!  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Each.

                                  TALIA
                    You pay per boob?  If anything in 
                    the world should be sold in a pair, 
                    it should be boobs.

      They walk off stage and head toward the dressing area.  A 
      girl in a bathrobe walks past.                                                                                            3.


                                  MARA
                    I heard that Gadhafi comment by the 
                    way.

      She crosses off.

                                  TALIA
                    Well, I m depressed.  Where do you 
                    want to go get drunk tonight?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I can t.

                                  TALIA
                    Why not?  It s Tuesday.  We always 
                    get drunk on Tuesday.  And 
                      Wednesday, and Thursday...

                                  MICHELLE
                    Tonight I am going straight home 
                    and straight to bed.  I have to be 
                    in perfect shape tomorrow.

                                  TALIA
                    Why?

                                  MICHELLE
                      Because....
                          (a big smile breaks out)
                    I got it.

                                  TALIA
                    No!  The audition for  Love ?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Tomorrow at ten sharp.

                                  TALIA
                    I can t believe it.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I m finally going to get to really 
                    dance again.  With steps and 
                    pointed toes and everything.

                                  TALIA
                    God, I m so jealous.  How?

                                  MICHELLE
                    My buddy Jimmy Hewson s the new 
                    dance captain.  He arranged the 
                    whole thing.

      A make STAGEHAND walks up to Michelle.                                                                                          4.


                                  STAGEHAND
                    Hey Michelle, Prince Charming is 
                    here for you again.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (stops short)
                    What?  Oh no.  Where is he?

                                  STAGEHAND
                          (points)
                    By your dressing table.

      The stagehand heads off.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh crap.  Not tonight.

                                  TALIA
                    Come on he s sweet and harmless.  
                    Everytime he comes to town he 
                    brings you presents, he buys you 
                      dinners...

                                  MICHELLE
                    He s odd and weird and technically 
                      a stalker.

                                  TALIA
                    He s lonely.

                                  MICHELLE
                    He wears gym socks with a suit. 

                                  TALIA
                    Well, at least you have an admirer.  
                    I ve got nothing.  I buy my own 
                    dinners.    

                                  MICHELLE
                    Go distract him so I can get my 
                    stuff and slip out the back?

                                  TALIA
                    That s mean.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I know.  I am a mean girl.  The 
                    sooner he learns that the better.

                                  TALIA
                    He s been coming here once a month 
                    for a year.  I think he s a slow 
                    learner.                                                                                          5.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Please, Thalia, I have to be 
                    perfect tomorrow. Perfect, and 
                    glowing, and twenty-nine by 10 a.m. 
                    Sharp.

                                  TALIA
                      Twenty-nine?  Who s going to 
                    believe that?

                                  MICHELLE
                      Canadians. 

                                    HUBBELL (O.C.)
                    Michelle!  Hey!

                                  MICHELLE
                    Rats.

      Michelle turns to see Hubbell FALLS racing over to her.  
      Hubbell is in his forties, bad suit, hang dog face, kind 
      eyes, with just the slightest whiff of loser surrounding him.  
      He holds a giant bouquet of flowers and a shoebox. 

                                    HUBBELL
                    Wow.  You look great.  I thought I 
                    missed you but then I saw your 
                    purse on your chair.  Did not go 
                    through it, but I figured what lady 
                    leaves without her purse?  
                          (holds out the flowers and 
                          the box)
                    For you.  African roses and the new 
                    fall pumps.  Hot off the assembly 
                    line.

                                  MICHELLE
                    That s very sweet, Hubbell.  Thank 
                    you.

                                    HUBBELL
                    You are welcome.  Gosh, seeing you 
                    again, you just get prettier, you 
                    know that?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh, I don t think so.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Well, you do.  Listen, I took the 
                    liberty of making a reservation at 
                     Cut  tonight.  It s a steak 
                      restaurant, Wolfgang Puck.                                                                                           6.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh Hubbell...

                                    HUBBELL
                    I didn t get a chance to take you 
                    to dinner last time I was in town.  
                    You had that terrible sudden flu, 
                    remember?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I do.  That was a doozy.

                                    HUBBELL
                    So, this time, I wanted to make 
                    sure dinner was extra special.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Hubbell, I m afraid I can t go to 
                    dinner tonight.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Are you still sick?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No.  I actually have a really 
                    important appointment tomorrow and 
                    I have to go home and sleep.  But, 
                    I bet that Talia...

      Michelle grabs TWO MORE BUXOM SHOWGIRLS standing by.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    And Hillary and Lucy would love to 
                    go with you to  Cut .  Right girls?  
                    Dinner?  Steak?  Yum.  

                                    HILLARY
                      Uh...sure.

                                  LUCY
                    I ll eat.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Great.  
                          (to Hubbell)
                    Now, you have a harem.  Very Vegas.

      Michelle quickly gathers her stuff together.

                                    HUBBELL
                          (trying to hide his 
                              disappointment)
                    You sure you couldn t have one 
                    drink first?                                                                                          7.


                                  MICHELLE
                    I can t.  I m sorry.  I wish I had 
                    known you were going to be in 
                    town...

                                    HUBBELL
                    Well, I left three messages and 
                    sent a telegram...

                                  MICHELLE
                    But next time.  I promise.  Okay?
                          (tosses her coat over her 
                            costume)
                    Thanks for the gifts!  Super sweet!

      Michelle runs out.

                                    HUBBELL
                          (calling after her)
                    There are a pair of Dr. Scholl s in 
                    the box so open it carefully.

      Hubbell looks after her wistfully.

                                  TALIA
                          (pats his shoulder)
                    We re just going to change.

      Talia, Gin and Hillary head off.

                                  LUCY
                    So, what do we have to do for this 
                    dinner?

                                  TALIA
                    Nothing.

                                    HILLARY
                    Really?  Guys just get weirder and 
                    weirder.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. MICHELLE S BEDROOM - MORNING  

      The alarm blares.  We PAN OVER A RUMPLED EMPTY BED and onto 
      the floor where Michelle is doing sit-ups.  

                                  MICHELLE
                      ...Ninety-Seven, ninety-eight, 
                      ninety-nine, one-hundred.

      She lays down and pulls her right leg up over her head.  Then 
      her left leg up over her head.  She sits up and bends over 
      both legs grabbing her ankles.  She slowly rolls herself up 
      and lets out a deep breath and smiles satisfied.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    It s showtime.

      EXT. VEGAS STRIP - MORNING 

      A beat-up Volkswagon bug zips between cars and into the 
       Mirage  driveway.

      EXT. MIRAGE - MOMENTS LATER

      The bug screeches to a halt.  Michelle gets out.  She s 
      wearing tights and a sleek black leotard and a  Love  
      baseball jacket over it.  A young Valet stands there.  

                                  MICHELLE
                          (to valet)
                    So the jacket - sucking up or 
                    classy touch?

                                  OLDER VALET GUY
                    Uh...

                                  MICHELLE
                    Sucking up.  Right.  
                          (she throws the jacket 
                            back in the car)
                    Okay.  I m good.  I m ready.  How 
                    old am I?  I m twenty-nine.  You 
                    buy it?  Cause, I didn t get into 
                    sunscreen till the late nineties.  

                                  OLDER VALET GUY
                    Sure.  Why not.  It s Vegas.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Thanks!                                                                                          9.


      She tosses him the keys and runs into the hotel.

      INT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

      Michelle makes her way towards the  Love  theatre.  She stops 
      at the  Employees Only  door.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (whispers to herself)
                    You can do this.  You have to do 
                    this.  Please, just...do this.

      Deep breath.  She pushes the door open.

      INT. THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

      Michelle enters.  The room is filled with performers going 
      through their paces.  A couple of acrobats hang from the 
      rafters.  The place is organized chaos, energy, and talent.  
      Michelle looks around happily.  JIMMY HEWSON, dance captain 
      spots her and hurries over.  

                                  JIMMY
                    Michelle!  You re on time!

                                  MICHELLE
                    Jimmy!  Hi.  I m ignoring the 
                    surprise in your voice.  

                                  JIMMY
                    I m sorry.  It s just a little 
                    crazy here today.   

                                  MICHELLE
                    Hey, how do I look?  I picked this  
                    leotard cause it s simple from the 
                    front but it goes way up my ass so 
                    it s kind of Vegas family friendly.

                                  JIMMY
                    You look great.  

      They start walking.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    Now, the director is Dominic 
                      Champagne.  I ve told him all about 
                    you... 

                                  MICHELLE
                    Whoa!

                                  JIMMY
                    With editing.                                                                                          10.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Thank you.

                                  JIMMY
                    He likes you to act it, not just 
                    dance it.  Cover space, use the 
                    stage, and smile.
                          (calling out)
                    Dominic.

      They walk up to DOMINIC CHAMPAGNE.  He stars at the ceiling 
      and wears a  Love  baseball jacket. 

                                  MICHELLE
                          (to herself)
                    Should ve worn the jacket.  

      Jimmy walks up to Dominic.

                                  JIMMY
                    Dom, this is Michelle Simms.  I 
                    told you about her.  She s 
                      auditioning for the swing position.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I m so excited to dance for you.  

                                  JIMMY
                          (to Dominic)
                    I ve already run her through the 
                    routine so whenever you re ready...

      Dominic glances over at Michelle.  He stares a beat.  

                                    DOMINIC
                    No.

                                  JIMMY
                    What?

                                  MICHELLE
                    But...I m twenty-nine.

                                    DOMINIC
                    She s not right.

                                  JIMMY
                    She s really good.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Just let me show you the routine.  
                    I swear you won t be sorry.

      A cry is heard from above.                                                                                          11.


                                    HANGING GIRL (O.C.)
                      Dominic!!!!  I have been hanging 
                    here for ten minutes!  What the 
                    hell are they doing?

                                    DOMINIC
                          (calling up)
                    We re going as fast as we can!

      Michelle looks at Jimmy pleading.

                                  JIMMY
                    Dom, please.  For me.

                                    DOMINIC
                    I m sorry, Jimmy.  
                          (calling off)
                    Just cut her down if you have to!

      Jimmy looks over at a crushed Michelle.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (bitterly)
                    And that s showbiz.  Kid.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MICHELLE S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      A breeze blows through an open window.  We PAN AROUND the 
      dark apartment.  White walls, aluminum blinds, a smattering 
      of miss matched furniture.  No decoration or life evident 
      anywhere, like the occupant is just passing through.  
      Pictures are on the floor leaned up against the wall never 
      hung.  We linger on a picture of Michelle taken when she 
      first got to Vegas ten years ago.  A real showgirl glamour 
      shot.  Smiling, sexy - she looks like a movie star.

      The front door opens and Michelle walks in.  She tosses her 
      dance bag on the floor and grabs a beer out of the empty 
      fridge.  She pops the top, takes a swig, goes over to the 
      wall unit and flips it on.  It makes a sad, gurgling death 
      rattle and then nothing.  She gives it a kick.  Still 
      nothing.  She takes off her shoe and beats it till her arm 
      hurts then tosses her shoe aside and lopsidedly goes outside.

      EXT. MICHELLE S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      The two story complex looks an awful lot like  Leaving Los 
      Vegas  but not so cheery.  Michelle comes out and leans on 
      the railing overlooking the sad dirty pool and swigs her 
      beer.  DELILAH, a heavily made-up woman in a bad wig, super 
      silver glitter mini skirt, and ratty pink fuzzy slippers 
      passes by with a bucket of ice.                                                                                          12.


                                    DELILAH
                    Geez.  Who died?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Your fashion sense.

                                    DELILAH
                    Well, take that tragic face inside.  
                    I have guests coming over and that 
                    is going to spoil the party.

                                  MICHELLE
                    As long as my face doesn t look 
                    like Chris Hansen your guests will 
                    be fine.

      Delilah sniffs indignantly and goes inside.  Michelle takes 
      another swig of her beer.  We pull back high and wide 
      revealing the colorful lights of the strip blazing in the 
      distance behind the sad apartment complex.  The glamorous 
      life sure looks a long ways away. 

      INT. BACKSTAGE - THE NEXT NIGHT

      Michelle walks in, her coat over her costume.  The costumer 
      walks up to her furious.

                                  COSTUMER
                    I swear to God, the next time you 
                    leave this theatre in your costume 
                    you will be fined.  A lot.  I mean 
                    it!  I ll ruin you.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Too late.  I got there first.

      Michelle drops down in her chair.  Talia sits next to her.

                                  TALIA
                    Should I ask?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Nope.

                                  TALIA
                    So, where should we go get drunk 
                    tonight?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Someplace close.

      Off in the distance we hear:                                                                                          13.


                                    HUBBELL (O.C.)
                    Excuse me, I was wondering if 
                    Michelle was here yet?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Are you kidding me?  He s still 
                    here?

                                  TALIA
                    He talked about you all night long.
                          (as Hubbell)
                       Michelle s so beautiful, 
                      Michelle s so smart, usually tall 
                    girls are intimidating, Michelle s 
                    not intimidating, she s wonderful. 
                    Dinner was delicious though.  He s 
                    not cheap, this guy.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I can t deal with this now.
                          (gathering up her stuff)
                    Look, just tell him I died and I ll 
                    see him next month.  

      Michelle stands up and turns right into Hubbell.  He holds a 
      large bouquet of flowers and a fancy wrapped box.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                          (startled)
                    Ahhh!  Hubbell!  You scared me!

                                    HUBBELL
                    I m sorry.  I should ve walked up 
                    slower.  Gosh, you look wonderful.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Thank you.

                                    HUBBELL
                    How did your audition go?

                                  MICHELLE
                    It went fine.  Great.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I knew it.  I knew it would.  Here.

      He hands her the flowers and the box.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Thanks.  Look, I really need to get 
                    ready for the show, so...                                                                                          14.


                                    HUBBELL
                    Open your present first.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (no fight left in her)
                    Okay.  Sure.

      She opens the box and pulls out a beautiful black velvet 
      watch with diamonds around the face.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                          (stunned)
                    Oh Hubbell...

                                    HUBBELL
                    Do you like it?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Do I like it?  Who could not like 
                    this?  It s stunning.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I got it wholesale from my friend 
                    Drew who s in the diamond biz. 

                                  MICHELLE
                          (looks at the watch and 
                            tears up a little)
                    I ve never gotten anything this 
                    beautiful in my entire life. 
                          (beat, then sadly)
                    My audition did not go great.  It 
                    was a disaster.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    I can t believe that.

                                  MICHELLE
                    He didn t even let me dance.  He 
                    just looked at me and said  no .

      Hubbell studies her for a beat.

                                    HUBBELL
                          (gently)
                    Michelle, can I take you to dinner 
                    after the show?  If you like we can 
                    order nothing but dessert.

      Michelle looks at him.  He s awfully sweet.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (smiles a little)
                    Sure.  Dinner would be great.                                                                                          15.


      INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - LATER

      Michelle and Hubbell sit in front of giant steaks.  
      Michelle s halfway through a giant martini, and judging from 
      her slurring and half closed eyes, it s clearly not her 
      first. 

                                  MICHELLE
                     No .  That was it.   No .   Hey 
                      Dominique, this is Michelle .  
                     No.   Just like that.   No .
                          (she knocks back the rest 
                          of her drink)
                    It was so humiliating.  Everybody 
                    in that theatre just watching the 
                    over the hill loser get the big 
                    heave-ho.    
                          (she waves her empty glass 
                          at a waiter)
                    You know, I have been trying to get 
                    this audition for a million years.  
                    And then I get it and I don t even 
                    get to dance.

                                    HUBBELL
                    You are not over the hill.

                                  MICHELLE
                    If a director can just look at me 
                    and say  no  in like three seconds, 
                    it s not  no  cause I m so young 
                    and hot, it s  no  cause I m 
                    starting to look like an IHOP 
                    cashier.

      The waiter puts another drink in front of her.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                          (to waiter, annoyed)
                    Seriously dude,  keep  em coming  
                    was not a euphemism.

      The waiter takes her empty glass and goes.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Maybe you were too tall.

                                  MICHELLE
                    And old.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I have seen that show.  Everyone 
                    seems very tiny.                                                                                          16.


                                  MICHELLE
                    And not old.

                                    HUBBELL
                    You should eat something.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yes.  So I can be fat and old.
                          (her new watch s sparkle 
                            catches her eye)
                    Oh man, this is so pretty.  You are 
                    so nice to me.  Why are you so nice 
                    to me?  

                                    HUBBELL
                    Oh, I m not that nice to you.

                                  MICHELLE
                    What are you talking about?  You 
                    bring me shoes and flowers, and 
                    sparkly watches and you feed my 
                    friends and you keep coming back 
                    even though I blow you off like 
                    ninety per cent of the time.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    I don t think the percentage is 
                    that high. 

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh, it is.  I m awful to you.  I m 
                      just...awful.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    I don t think you re awful.

                                  MICHELLE
                    You don t?

                                    HUBBELL
                    I think you are the most 
                      spectacular girl in the world.  The 
                    first time I saw you on stage I 
                    thought  wow . 

                                  MICHELLE
                    Did I fall?  

                                    HUBBELL
                    You did not fall.  You smiled.  You 
                    were perfect.  And I thought, 
                     there s no way a girl like that 
                    will talk to me , but you did.                                                                                          17.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, you offered to take me to 
                    dinner.

                                    HUBBELL
                    That wasn t it.

                                  MICHELLE
                    It was the end of the month.  I was 
                    really hungry.

                                    HUBBELL
                    If you were my girl, I d make sure 
                    you d never be hungry ever again.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (taken aback by that 
                            statement)
                    Well, it s not like I was  Oliver  
                    or anything...

                                    HUBBELL
                    Have I ever told you about where I 
                    live?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I don t remember.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I live in this beautiful town 
                    called Paradise.  

                                  MICHELLE
                          (dreamy)
                    Paradise.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    It s on the coast.  Right near the 
                    ocean.  So, it s always breezy.  
                    And my house is the best house on 
                    the street.  It s up on a bluff 
                    with big trees in the back yard...

                                  MICHELLE
                    For the woodland creatures to play 
                    in.

                                    HUBBELL
                    And my favorite room in house is my 
                    bed room.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, yeah.  Cause of sex.                                                                                          18.


                                    HUBBELL
                    Well, no, I mean, yes, but in my 
                    bedroom the is this huge picture 
                    window the whole length of the room 
                    and all you see when you look out 
                    is the beautiful blue ocean. 

                                  MICHELLE
                          (entranced by his story)
                    Wow.
                          (beat)
                    I live next door to a hooker.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Michelle, I know you don t know me 
                    from Adam....

                                  MICHELLE
                    I ve never understood what that 
                    meant...

                                    HUBBELL
                    But, I want to take care of you.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    That s so nice.  
                          (to a passing couple)
                    Isn t that nice?
                          (to Hubbell)
                    Do we know them?

      Hubbell takes her hand.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Michelle, let me take care of you.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I don t understand what you...

                                    HUBBELL
                    Marry me.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (she finally gets it)
                    Oh.  Hubbell.  No.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I can make you happy.

                                  MICHELLE
                    You don t understand.  I suck at 
                      relationships.  I m like Godzilla.  
                    Men run from me.  They flee.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                          19.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    And not just Japanese men.  All 
                      nationalities flee.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    I won t flee.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Buy some comfortable shoes.

                                    HUBBELL
                          (firmly)
                    I promise you, I won t flee.  I ll 
                    be the one scientist who 
                      understands you.  The one who knows 
                    that you re not burning down Japan 
                    because you re evil, you re burning 
                    down Japan to protect the giant 
                    lizard eggs you just laid in a cave 
                    by the ocean.  A cave no one knows 
                    is there.  But me.  

                                  MICHELLE
                          (overwhelmed)
                    God, that s beautiful.

                                    HUBBELL
                    No.  You re beautiful.  And you 
                    deserve to be happy.  What do you 
                    say?

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. HUBBELL S CAR - MORNING 

      Michelle s head hang out of an open window.  Her hair blows 
      wildly and last nights make-up is smeared all over her face.  
      She slowly wakes, blinks in the sunlight, and tries to 
      remember where she is.  She glances over and sees Hubbell 
      happily driving.  She lifts her left hand.  A tiny diamond 
      ring glitters on her ring finger.  It s all coming back.  She 
      drops her head back down and stares out the window.

      WE CUT WIDE to see Hubbell s Volvo driving up the California 
      coast as we:  

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                          20.


                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

      EXT. FLOWER S DANCE ACADEMY - DAY 

      We push in on a converted barn surrounded by trees and 
      flowers.  Cheery and weathered, a sign outside reads  Falls 
      Dance Academy .  Piano music drifts out of the studio.

      INT. FLOWERS DANCE ACADAMY - CONTINUOUS

      A large well-worn room with mirrors and barres on every wall.  
      An older distinguished man plays piano as a roomful of girls, 
      ages thirteen to seventeen, go through their barre routine.      

                                  FANNY (O.C.)
                    Grand battements and other side.

      The whole room turns and begins the other side.   

      ANGLE ON: the feet of the dancers.  Some in Pointe shoes, 
      some in regular ballet shoes, as they point and work.  A pair 
      of bright red character shoes walk into frame, the person 
      wearing them has a cane that pounds out the beat of the 
      music.  We PAN UP the back of the teacher and see the faces 
      of the girls she s teaching.  

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    And posse, knees out, higher 
                      please...shoulders Melanie...

      She passes MELANIE SEGAL 15, super skinny, too tall for her 
      age, has some posture issues.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    ...Extend out...lovely, Sasha... 

      She passes SASHA TORRES, 17, perfect.  Perfect body, 
      extension, technique.  The only thing she doesn t have is the 
      soul of a dancer.  The spark.  The fire. 

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    ...Lift higher...po-po in, Boo!

      The cane raps BETTINA  BOO  JORDAN, 15, on the butt.  Boo is 
      a little tubby, not fat, but compared to the others, she 
      feels huge.  Plus she wears a leotard with a dancing  Snoopy  
      on the stomach which doesn t help matters much.  Boo idolizes 
      Sasha and would give anything to be able to do what she does.  
      She does not have the body, but she has the heart.                                                                                           21.


                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    ...Lift the knees...where are you 
                    looking Ginny?

      GINNY THOMPSON, 14, snaps her gaze back from the mirror.  She 
      used to be the best in the class until she stopped growing up 
      and her boobs started growing out.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    ... And grand battement...other 
                    side.  Hold.

      The room switches sides.  The teacher turns and we meet FANNY 
      FLOWERS.  A handsome, timeless woman, dressed in flowing 
      skirts and shawls, a scarf wrapped theatrically around her 
      head.  She looks like a high end gypsy.  She is imperious, 
      theatrical, a queen and this is her kingdom.  She holds up 
      her hand dramatically.  The music stops.  No one breathes.         

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    And - sixteen grand battements.  
                    One!  Two!  Three!

      The girls kick their legs up as high as they can.  All faces 
      red from effort except for Sasha who doesn t have to try.  
      Her perfect leg seems to float up to her ear.  She almost 
      looks like she s going to yawn.  

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                          (moving over the piano)
                      ...Fifteen, sixteen - hold...

      Legs are held in the air.  They shake, some drop, until...

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    And relax.  Everyone on the floor.

      A loud collective sigh of relief.  

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    Oh please.  Mr. Balanchine once 
                    made us do grande battements for 
                    two and a half hours until was 
                      satisfied.  He only stopped when 
                    three of the dancers fainted.  One 
                    never returned.  She went to work 
                    at Macy s.

      Fanny sits on the piano bench next to MICHAEL RIMBAUD, her 
      longtime friend, pianist and, the rumor is, one time lover.

                                    MICHAEL
                          (sotto to Fanny)
                    Is that true?                                                                                          22.


                                  FANNY
                    No.  It was Bloomingdales.  But 
                    Macy s sounds so much more 
                      depressing.
                          (to the class)
                    Alright.  Everyone stretch.

      The girls move to the middle of the room.  Sasha lays down 
      and casually pulls her leg up over her head.  Boo looks at 
      the leg jealously.

                                  BOO
                    I started stretching every night.
                    I ll be able to do that soon.

                                  SASHA
                    I ll alert the media.

      Sasha holds her foot and rolls over into the splits.  She 
      lays her head down on her knee like she could sleep there.

                                  BOO
                    Oh, now you re just showing off.

                                  SASHA
                    It s just a stretch, Boo.  So, you 
                    don t have extension.  You can 
                    jump.

                                  BOO
                    Boys jump.  

                                    MELANIE
                    So, be a boy.  Ballet always needs 
                    boys.

                                  BOO
                    Funny, Melanie.

                                  GINNY
                    At least you don t have to wear two 
                    bras under your leotard.

                                    MELANIE
                    You really wear two bras?

                                  GINNY
                    I don t want to talk about it.

                                    MELANIE
                    You brought it up.

      Sasha sits up in her split, bends her back knee, arches back 
      and touches her foot to her head.                                                                                          23.


                                  BOO
                          (sighs)
                    I m think I m going to be sick.

      EXT. PARADISE - SAME TIME 

      Hubbell s car drives through the streets.

      INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Michelle gazes out the window at her new home town.  Blue 
      collar is the polite way of putting it.  There s a hodgepodge 
      of houses with the occasional trailer and mobile home thrown 
      in.  An older woman in a straw hat and a pig on a leash 
      frowns as she watches the car drive past.  Michelle glances 
      over at Hubbell.  He looks at her and beams.  She turns back 
      to the window.  

                                  MICHELLE
                          (sotto)
                    And I ve moved to green acres.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    What was that sweetheart?

                                  MICHELLE
                          (a la Eva Gabor)
                    Nothing Dahling.

      INT. FLOWERS DANCE ACADAMY - A LITTLE LATER  

      The class is finishing up their floor combination.  Sasha is 
      front and center and Boo is hidden in the back.  They finish 
      the and immediately go into their reverence (the bows at the 
      end of class).  They all hold -

                                  FANNY
                    And, thank you ladies.

      The girls applaud.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    Now before you go, we still have 
                    not found the missing tutu.  If we 
                    do not find it by the 15th we will 
                    have to cut the Sugarplum Fairy out 
                    of the Nutcracker which will make 
                    us look ridiculous.  Check your 
                    brothers  closets.  That s how we 
                    found the black swan costume last 
                    year.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                          24.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    Also, next week Anna Cheselka, the 
                    head of the Joffrey school of 
                    ballet, will be coming here to hold 
                    auditions for their summer 
                      scholarship program.  This is a 
                      prestigious program and I want all 
                    of you who participate to be at 
                    your best.  Do not humiliate me.  I 
                    am old.  Any shock could kill me.  
                    The sign up sheet s on the wall.  

      The girls head off to the dressing room.  Boo goes up to 
      Ginny, Melanie, and Sasha.

                                  BOO
                    Ginny, are you going to sign up?

                                  GINNY
                    No.

                                  BOO
                    Why?

                                  GINNY
                    There s no way I ll get in.

                                  BOO
                    You re a really good dancer.

                                  GINNY
                    They want bodies like Sasha.  I m 
                    going to end up selling real estate 
                    like my mother.

      Boo looks over at Sasha.  Then back to Ginny.

                                  BOO
                    You think I should try out?

                                    MELANIE
                    Not in a Snoopy leotard.

                                  BOO
                    I m talking to Ginny.

                                  SASHA
                    Try out.  Don t try out.  Who 
                    cares?  It s school.  A whole 
                    summer of school.  That s fun.

                                  BOO
                    But, you re going to try out, 
                    right?                                                                                          25.


                                  SASHA
                    It s not like I ve got anything 
                    better to do.  

      Sasha heads off.  Melanie and Ginny follow. Boo hangs back 
      eyeing the sign up sheet.

      INT. HUBBELL S HOUSE - SAME TIME 

      The front door opens.  Hubbell and Michelle stand there.

                                    HUBBELL
                    This is it.  Our home.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Huh.  

      Beat.  She makes no move to go in.

                                    HUBBELL
                          (gently taking her arm)
                    Shall we?

      Hubbell walks Michelle into the room.  The place is homey, 
      too much furniture, a lot of color, and hundreds of little 
      statues, all with faces.  Frog faces, dog faces, glittery 
      saxophone playing clown faces - stuffed animals are big, too.  

                                    HUBBELL (CONT D)
                    It s a little eclectic, I know.  I 
                    let my mother decorate the place.

                                  MICHELLE
                    How very Graceland of you.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Well, she enjoys things being a bit 
                      theatrical.  Dramatic.  There s a 
                    lot of...well, you ll just have to 
                    meet her for yourself.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    I can not wait.

      She wanders into the kitchen.

      INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      Michelle peeks her head in.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Wow.  That s a lot of cookie jars.                                                                                          26.


                                    HUBBELL
                          (appearing in the doorway 
                            behind her)
                    They re from all over the world.  
                    Mother traveled.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Sure.

                                    HUBBELL
                    You hungry? 

                                  MICHELLE
                    Nope.  Not hungry.  Just a 
                    little...

      She knocks over a home made shrine set up on a side table.  
      Incense and statues go flying everywhere.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Mother s a Buhddist.
                          (takes her hand)
                    Come on.

      INT. HUBBELLS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Hubbell leads her down a hallway that has pictures covering 
      the walls literally from floor to ceiling.

                                  MICHELLE
                    The whole house is looking at me.

      Hubbell stops in front of a door.

                                    HUBBELL
                    This is our room.

      Michelle braces herself.  Hubbell opens the door.  

      INT. HUBBELL S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      It s like she walked into another dimension.  Open, airy, 
      tastefully decorated, and best of all, floor to ceiling 
      windows that have perfect unobstructed views of the ocean.  
      Michelle wanders over to the window and opens it.  The ocean 
      breeze feels amazing on her face.  She sinks down into the 
      window seat and stares at the water.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh Hubbell.

                                    HUBBELL
                    You like it?                                                                                          27.


                                  MICHELLE
                    I could sit here forever.

                                    HUBBELL
                    That s my plan.

      Michelle smiles at him.  A genuine smile.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    You didn t let your mother take a 
                    crack at this room, huh?

                                    HUBBELL
                    No.  She got the rest of the house. 
                    This is mine.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, I can see why you love it.

                                    HUBBELL
                    You re going to love it, also.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yeah.  If I never leave this chair.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Hey, this is your house now.  We 
                    can do whatever you want to make it 
                      comfortable.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Really?  Can we get rid of the -

                                  FANNY (O.C.)
                    What?

      Startled, Michelle and Hubbell turn to find Fanny standing in 
      the doorway.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    Mom!

                                  FANNY
                    Yes.  Mom.  I m here.  Who s this?

                                    HUBBELL
                    This is Michelle.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Namaste.

                                  FANNY
                    What?                                                                                          28.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Cause you re...Buddah.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Ist.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Ist.  Buddhist.

                                  FANNY
                    Well, hello Michelle.  I am Fanny.  
                    Hubbell s mother.  What was it in 
                    my house you wanted to get rid of?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Your house?
                          (to Hubbell)
                    Her house?

                                    HUBBELL
                    Our house actually.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Our house?  Like...
                          (motioning to herself, 
                            Hubbell, and Fanny)
                    ...our house?

                                  FANNY
                    No like...
                          (motions to herself and 
                            Hubbell)
                    ...Our house.

                                  MICHELLE
                    But...you live with your mother?  
                    Like a serial killer?

                                    HUBBELL
                    Michelle, could I just have a 
                    second with Mom please?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yes.  I ll just be...somewhere.

                                  FANNY
                    Don t throw anything out.

      Michelle leaves.  Fanny turns to face Hubbell.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    Something to tell me, dear?                                                                                          29.


      INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Michelle stands in the hall not sure where to go.  She 
      glances at the pictures.  Many of them are of a young 
      ballerina.  Publicity stills.  She looks closely for a beat.  

                                  FANNY (O.C.)
                    You what?!!!!!!!

      Michelle runs off down the hall.

      EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Michelle bolts out the back door.  The sounds of Fanny and 
      Hubbell arguing waft after her.  She looks around and notices 
      a structure behind the house.  She strolls past the sign 
      announcing  Flower s Dance Academy  and up to the open door 
      and peers in.  Inside she sees Boo working on her arabesque.  
      She s not having much luck.  She teeters and falls.  She 
      tries again.  Sasha and Melanie comes out of the dressing 
      room dressed in their street clothes.    

                                  SASHA
                    Class is over, Boo.

                                  BOO
                    Five minutes.

                                    MELANIE
                    Five minutes is not going to help.

                                  BOO
                          (does another arabesque)
                    How does it look?

                                  SASHA
                    I m starving.

                                  BOO
                    Is my line long?

                                    MELANIE
                    There s a mirror right there.

                                  BOO
                    If I look I ll fall.

                                  SASHA
                    Let s get pizza.  

                                  BOO
                    Just look first.

      The girls look. Sasha shrugs.                                                                                          30.


                                  BOO (CONT D)
                    I don t know what you did.  What 
                    did you do?

                                  MICHELLE
                    You have to square off your 
                      shoulders.

      Melanie and Sasha suddenly notice Michelle in the doorway.

                                  BOO
                    Who said that?  Who s talking?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Your right shoulder s pulled too 
                    far back.  Square it off.

      Boo shifts her shoulder forward.  Her arabesque steadies.

                                  BOO
                    Hey!  It s working!

                                    MELANIE
                          (whispers to Sasha)
                    Who s that?

      Sasha shrugs.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Now lift your leg a little higher, 
                    chin up, and walla.

                                  BOO
                          (whirls around happily)
                    That was so cool.  It was like, 
                    suddenly I could hold it!  

                                  MICHELLE
                    That s how it works. One day it 
                    just clicks.

                                  BOO
                    That was so satisfying.
                          (beat)
                    Who are you?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh, well I am...

      Fanny appears at the door.

                                  FANNY
                    She is my daughter-in-law.  Aren t 
                    you?                                                                                          31.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Uh...

                                  FANNY
                    Well, at least according to my son 
                    and my son never lies.  
                          (to the girls)
                    They got married in Las Vegas.  
                    Isn t that romantic?  
                          (to Michelle)
                    Did Elvis do the ceremony?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No.

                                  FANNY
                    Wayne Newton?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No.

                                  FANNY
                    Charo?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Just the guy who owned the drive-
                    through.

                                  FANNY

                    What s your name?         

                                  MICHELLE
                    Michelle.

                                  FANNY

                    my advanced class.  Sasha, Melanie, 
                    Ginny, and Boo.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Hey here.

                                  FANNY

                    Oh, that s not...

                    them to spread the word, you re 
                    welcome.  Of course, you girls are 
                    all invited too.

      The girls seem genuinely pleased.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh no.  You guys don t have to 
                    come.  You ll be so bored.

                                  GINNY
                    No, we won t.

                          (off Fanny s look)
                    Including me.  I m an oldie too.

                                  SASHA
                    Do you not want us to come?

                                  MICHELLE

                    No.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Really?

                                  BOO
                    Not since the movie theatre closed.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Wait.  There s no movie theatre in 
                    this town?

                                    MELANIE
                    It s not so bad.  They open the 
                    skating rink in November. 

                                  GINNY
                    And sometimes Mr. Feldstein forgets 
                    to lock the library door and we go 
                    in and read.                                                                                          33.


                                  BOO
                    Yeah, that s cool.

                                  TINA
                    Or we just hang here. 

                                  MICHELLE
                          (beat)
                    You re all screwing with me, right?

                                  FANNY
                    Paradise is a sleepy town.  But we 
                    love it.  And I m sure you will 
                    too.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Uh huh.  So, I m sorry, how far 
                    away is the nearest movie theatre?

                                  FANNY
                          (to the girls)
                    Okay, girls go home and get pretty 
                    we ll see you back here at six.

      The girls hurry off.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    Now, I have to see about some 
                      champagne.  Paradise is dry so I 
                    have to figure out who stockpiles.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Dry?

                                  FANNY
                    Don t worry.  I promise you ll have 
                    something bubbly at your party.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Fanny, I really don t need a party.

                                  FANNY
                    My son just got married. I didn t 
                    get to be at the ceremony so I d 
                    like to be at the party.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Sure.

                                  FANNY
                    You understand?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I do.                                                                                          34.


                                  FANNY
                    You approve?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Of course.

                                  FANNY
                    Because, God forbid I offend you.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I am not offended.

                                  FANNY
                    You re not offended that I want to 
                    throw you a wedding party after 
                    missing the wedding?  Oh thank 
                    goodness.  Now you go get changed 
                    and I will see to everything else.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh.  Uh, I don t really have 
                    anything else to wear.

                                  FANNY
                    You must ve packed something that 
                    works.
                          (beat)
                    You must ve packed.
                          (beat)
                    Goodness.  You re not pregnant are 
                    you?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No!  No, no, no.  Not pregnant.  We 
                    just got so carried away in the 
                    moment that I didn t think about 
                    clothes.  Is there someplace around 
                    here that I could buy something? 

                                  FANNY
                      Absolutely.  Just go down the 
                    street here and make a right and 
                    look for a store called Sparkles.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Okay.  Thanks.  I ll go now.

      She starts off down the street.  Fanny s smile fades as we:

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. PARADISE TOWN CENTER - A LITTLE LATER 

      Michelle wanders down the sidewalk staring at the various mom 
      and pop stores, interspersed with crap stores, and the  gone 
      out of business  stores.  Sleepy doesn t describe it.  
      Comatose is more like it.  Michelle sees the big  SPARKLES  
      sign which is actually missing most of its sparkles. 

      INT. SPARKLES - CONTINUOUS

      A room full of handmade clothing and trinkets.  Michelle 
      looks around.  TRULY STONE, small mousy perpetually depressed 
      and ironically owner of a place called  Sparkles  comes over.

                                  TRULY
                    I m Truly.  Can I help you?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh.  No.  I m just looking for 
                      something.  A dress.

      Truly holds up a dress.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Oh.  I m not a duck person but it s 
                    great.  Really.  

      Truly puts the dress back.

                                  TRULY
                    Is there something specific you re 
                    looking for?

                                  MICHELLE
                    A dress.  It s for a party.

                                  TRULY
                    Birthday party?  Graduation party?  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Wedding party, actually.  My 
                    wedding.  So something black, with 
                    a veil.

      Truly whirls around.

                                  TRULY
                    You re her.                                                                                          36.


                                  MICHELLE
                    I m...

                                  TRULY
                          (welling up)
                    You re the pole dancer from Reno.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I m not a pole dancer.  Who told 
                    you I was a pole dancer?

                                  TRULY
                    They said you weren t pretty.
                          (tears starting to slide 
                            down her cheeks)
                    You weren t supposed to be pretty.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Wait.  Don t cry.  Please.   

      A WOMAN, SAM, DRESSED COMPLETELY IN DUCKS comes out of the 
      back room.

                                  SAM
                    Truly?  Are you okay?  What s the 
                    matter?
                          (sees Michelle)
                    Oh God.  It s the stripper from 
                    Tahoe.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I m not a stripper.

                                  TRULY
                    She s pretty, Sam.  She wasn t 
                    supposed to be pretty.

                                  SAM
                    She s not pretty.

                                  TRULY
                    She is.

                                  SAM
                    Well, it s a manufactured pretty.  
                    It s a kit.  A pretty kit.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Okay.  I m going to go.  

                                  TRULY
                    You can t go.  You need something 
                    for your party.                                                                                          37.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Look, It s fine...

                                  TRULY
                    It s not fine.  This wedding party, 
                    it s for you and Hubbell, right?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Uh...yes.

                                  TRULY
                    This is the first time he s 
                      introducing you to the world as his 
                    wife, he can t see you in a tank 
                    top and shorts. 

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, he s already seen me pee 
                    behind a cactus in Pahrump so I 
                    don t think a little casualwear is 
                    gonna kill the deal now.

                                  TRULY
                    Wait here.

                                  MICHELLE
                    It s okay really -

                                  TRULY
                          (exploding)
                    You took the one man I ve ever 
                    loved in my life so the least you 
                    can do is wait!!!!  Here!!!!!

      Truly storms off to the back room.  Michelle stands there, 
      Sam staring at her with hate in her eyes.

                                  MICHELLE
                    It was Vegas, by the way.  Not 
                    Tahoe.

                                  SAM
                    No one cares.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Right.

      Truly comes back out holding a little black dress.

                                  TRULY
                    Here.                                                                                          38.


                                  MICHELLE
                          (genuine)
                    Oh wow.  This is, forgive the pun, 
                    truly beautiful.

                                  TRULY
                    I know.

                                  SAM
                    She knows.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Could I try it on?

                                  TRULY
                    It will fit.  I made it so I know.
                    It will fit and it s going to look 
                    really good on you cause you re 
                    tall and you have really long legs.
                    Do you need shoes?

      Michelle looks at her guiltily.  Truly s eyes well up again.

                                  TRULY (CONT D)
                    Follow me.

      Truly heads off.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (to Sam)
                    It was nice meeting you.

                                  SAM
                    I ll be at the party tonight.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Really.  Okay.  There s something 
                    very John Hughes-y about this 
                    situation don t you think?

      Truly comes back holding a pair of pumps.

                                  TRULY
                    How do want to pay for this?

                                  MICHELLE
                    In dollar bills and chlamydia.  
                          (off the horrified looks)
                    Visa.  Visa a good too.

      EXT. HUBBELL S HOUSE - EVENING

      The place looks festive.  A banner reading  Congratulations 
      Hubbell  hangs above the front door.                                                                                            39.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 

      The room is crowded.  People snack on Ritz crackers and white 
      wine.  Sasha, Boo, and Ginny sit on a couch.  Boo eyes the 
      crackers on the table.  Ginny eyes her own chest.

                                  GINNY
                    I swear they re bigger today then 
                      yesterday.

      Sasha grabs a handful of crackers and starts eating.  Boo 
      watches jealously.

                                  SASHA
                    I think you have an unhealthy 
                    obsession with your boobs.

                                  GINNY
                    I know.  Just like my mother.

      Sahsa notices Boo watching her eat.

                                  SASHA
                          (holds out a cracker)
                    You want?

                                  BOO
                    No.  I m on a diet.  The Joffrey 
                    auditions are next week.

                                  SASHA
                    How much thinner are you going to 
                    be in a week?

                                  BOO
                    I don t know.  Thinner.

      Sasha shrugs and stuffs the rest of the crackers in her 
      mouth.

                                  SASHA
                    I m bored.  I m going to find beer.

      Sasha gets up and heads off.  Boo looks after her.  

                                  GINNY
                          (sighs)
                      I couldn t have gotten my mother s 
                    nose.

      Melanie comes over.

                                    MELANIE
                    Sorry I m late.  Where s Sasha?                                                                                          40.


                                  BOO
                    She s looking for beer.

                                    MELANIE
                    Oh.  Cool.

      Melanie trots off.

      INT. DANCE STUDIO - SAME TIME 

      Fanny paces back and forth, clearly agitated.  Michael comes 
      in dressed in a suit complete with ascot.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You know the party and the people 
                    are in the house.

                                  FANNY
                    My darling Hubbell.  He goes out to 
                    work and brings home Heidi Fleiss.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You re his mother.  You re supposed 
                    to hate his wife.

                                  FANNY
                    I just don t understand why she s 
                    with him.  Any girl who wears her 
                    shorts that short usually wants a 
                    rapper.

      Fanny looks at herself in the mirror.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    God, I m old.

                                    MICHAEL
                    And on that note I am going to go 
                    get a glass of that cheap wine 
                    you re serving.  Are you coming?

                                  FANNY
                    In a minute.

      Michael exits off.  Fanny looks at herself in the mirror.  
      She does a little dance step.  She still looks good.  She 
      smiles a little to herself.

                                  BOO (O.C.)
                    Madame Fanny?

      Fanny turns to see Boo in the doorway.                                                                                          41.


                                  FANNY
                    Yes, Boo?

                                  BOO
                    Can I ask you something?

                                  FANNY
                    You can.

                                  BOO
                    Well, about the Joffrey auditions 
                    next week, I was thinking I was 
                    going to try out, so I wanted to 
                    ask you...should I?

                                  FANNY
                    Well, it certainly can t hurt.

                                  BOO
                    I know but, should I?  I mean, am I 
                    wasting my time?

      Fanny looks at her sympathetically.

                                  BOO (CONT D)
                    I mean, if I could dance like 
                    Sasha...I know I can turn and jump, 
                    but I m not a boy, so I just 
                    thought I d ask...I should I?  Try?

                                  FANNY
                          (beat)
                    Ballet is very hard, Boo.  And a 
                    lot of it does depend on how you re 
                    made.  You have to be realistic.  
                    You re not tall, you have a tummy, 
                    your feet are terrible... 

                                  BOO
                    Okay.  Thank you.

                                  FANNY
                    But none of that means you 
                    shouldn t try.  Right?

      Boo nods sadly.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    Now, if you ll excuse me I should 
                    probably make my appearance.  I ll 
                    see you inside?

      Fanny heads out.  Boo stares at herself in the mirror.                                                                                           42.


      INT. HUBBELL S ROOM - SAME TIME 

      Michelle stands in front of a mirror wearing the dress.  It s 
      perfect.

                                  MICHELLE
                    She was right, the little freak.  
                    Okay.  Here goes nothing.

      Michelle walks out of the room.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The room is lively.  Lots of chatter.  Michelle appears in 
      the doorway and looks for Hubbell.  She starts to make her 
      way into the room.  As she does the chatter subsides.  By the 
      time she hits the table with the wine the room is silent, 
      staring at her.  She smiles, pours herself a plastic cup of 
      wine.  She lifts her cup to the room then takes a sip and 
      almost chokes on it.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (coughing up wine)
                    Oh God, this is terrible.

                                    HUBBELL (O.C.)
                    There she is!

                                  MICHELLE
                    Hubbell!  Thank God.

      Hubbell comes up to her and she throws her arms around him.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    I ve never been so happy to see 
                    anyone in my entire life.  Where 
                    have you been? People are staring 
                    and pointing and this wine, have 
                    you had this wine?  

                                    HUBBELL
                    My mother is kind of known for her 
                    cheap booze.  It reminds her of her 
                    gypsy days touring with the Ballet 
                    Russe.  Wow.  That is some dress.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yeah?

                                    HUBBELL
                    You look so beautiful.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    You look nice too.                                                                                          43.


                                    HUBBELL
                    Okay, well, let me introduce you to 
                    everyone.  
                          (to the room)
                    Everyone, this is my wife.
                          (he laughs)
                    I can t believe I get to say that.  
                    My wife.  Anyhow, this is my wife, 
                    Michelle.  Michelle this is 
                    everyone.

      The room murmurs their  hello s .

                                  MICHELLE
                    Hey, there everybody.

      Sobbing is heard from the back of the room.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Hi Truly.

      A  hi  is sobbed back.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I m sure Michelle will make her way 
                    around the room eventually, we have 
                    all evening.  But I just want to 
                    say, thank you all for coming and 
                    some better wine is on the way.

      A chorus of  Thank God s  rumble through the room.  Fanny 
      sweeps in.

                                  FANNY
                    Well, I am insulted.  What is wrong 
                    with my wine?  It has a nun on the 
                    label and everything.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Hello mother.

      Fanny kisses Hubbell.

                                  FANNY
                    So?  How do you like your party?

                                    HUBBELL
                    It s a great party.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Good turnout.                                                                                          44.


                                  FANNY
                    Well, it s not everyday we have a 
                    Playboy playmate in our midst.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yeah, I m not a...

                                  FANNY
                    That is some dress.  Truly has 
                    outdone herself.  You met Truly?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I did.

                                  FANNY
                    You know she and Hubbell used to 
                    date.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Mother...

                                  FANNY
                    Oh honey, it was going to come out 
                      eventually.  Let s see, that man is 
                    my oldest friend and pianist 
                    Michael Rimbaud.  So handsome.  
                          (walks her to a couple)
                    And these my are my next door 
                    neighbors Mel and Sissy Gordon.  

                                  SISSY
                    Tell me, is Hugh Hefner nice?

                                  MICHELLE
                          (beat, then:)
                    Yes he is.

                                  FANNY
                          (pointing)
                    That s Joseph Roo, Nina Smalls, oh 
                    and that s Rene Lewis, she owns a 
                    lovely restaurant on Whipple if you 
                    like beets.  Now, over there is...

                                  MICHELLE
                    Uh, you know, I m sorry.  I think 
                    I...I need to get a little air.

      Michelle hurries off.  Hubbell follows after her.  

      INT. HUBBELL S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Michelle flies in and rushes to the picture window and 
      collapses down on the window seat.  Hubbell comes in.                                                                                          45.


                                    HUBBELL
                    Michelle?  Hey.  You alright?

                                  MICHELLE
                    This is a really beautiful view.  
                    You said it was a beautiful view 
                    and it is.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    I m glad you like it.

                                  MICHELLE
                    But you didn t tell me you lived 
                    with your mother.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I know.

                                  MICHELLE
                    And I mean, you really live with 
                    your mother.  She s everywhere.  
                    It s her house.

                                    HUBBELL
                    It s my house.  I paid for it.  I 
                    bought it.

                                  MICHELLE
                    She has a dance studio in the back.  
                    Her whole life is here.  You didn t 
                    tell me any of that.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I was so stunned when you said yes 
                    I didn t want to jinx it.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, that s a big thing to keep 
                    from someone.  And you have this 
                    whole town, and friends, and 
                    Truly s got some serious  I m 
                    driving cross country in diapers to 
                    kill you  potential.  And your 
                    mother just hates me. 

                                    HUBBELL
                    She s proud.  She s hurt.  She ll 
                    come around.  She just...  

                                  MICHELLE
                          (beat, softly)
                    I don t love you, Hubbell.  I m so 
                    sorry, but I don t.  I ve never 
                    loved anybody, really.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                          46.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    I m just not made that way.  And 
                    you are so wonderful.  You deserve 
                    to have someone love you.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    I know you don t love me.  I m not 
                    an idiot.  But I don t believe 
                    you re not made that way.  

                                  MICHELLE
                      Hubbell...

                                    HUBBELL
                    You want to love.  You just haven t 
                    found the right person yet.  Maybe 
                    you don t trust that anybody is 
                    going to understand you.  Well, I 
                    do.  I know exactly what you want.  
                    You want to laugh.  You want to 
                    travel.  You want to be surprised.  
                      Challenged.  You want to live an 
                      unexpected life.  And I intend to 
                    give you exactly that. 

                                  MICHELLE
                    Wow.  Good speech.

      Hubbell takes her in his arms and kisses her.  

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Wow.  Good kiss.

      Hubbell pulls her back in and they kiss again.  

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Where did you learn to kiss like 
                    that?  Oh God, don t say your 
                    mother...

      He kisses her again.  This time she kisses him back.  They 
      slide off the seat and sink to the ground as we:

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

      The party is still going strong.  Fanny has been cornered by 
      Truly.

                                  TRULY
                    You hire that girl to jump out of a 
                    cake.  You don t marry her.  

                                  FANNY
                    Well, Hubbell has some quirky ways.  

                                  TRULY
                    But, I make dresses, he sells 
                    shoes...I mean...

                                  FANNY
                    I know.

                                  TRULY
                    I just...

                                  FANNY
                    I know.

                                  TRULY
                    We re so...

                                  FANNY
                    Truly.  Listen to me.  This won t 
                    last.  I m telling you.  That girl 
                    is too fast for Hubbell.  He will 
                    bore her.  Mark my words.  

                                  TRULY
                    How do you know that?

                                  FANNY
                    Because, he s boring.  She s a 
                    Vegas girl.  Give it time. She ll 
                    be high tailing it out of here as 
                    fast as those freakishly long legs 
                    will take her.  And then you ll be 
                    here waiting I assume?

                                  TRULY
                    Of course.                                                                                          48.


                                  FANNY
                    Well then, dry your tears and get 
                    some more wine.

      Suddenly Michelle and Hubbell burst into the room.  They are 
      smiling, laughing, their hair s mussed up.  It s very clear 
      what they ve been doing.  The room erupts in whispers.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Wow, party s still happening huh?
                          (sotto to Hubbell)
                    Did the new wine show up yet?

                                    HUBBELL
                    Let s go check.

      ANGLE ON: FANNY FROWNING AT HER SON AND MICHELLE

                                  FANNY
                    Will you excuse me, Truly?

      Fanny heads over to the happy couple.

      ANGLE ON: MICHELLE AND Hubbell 

      They are at the wine table looking for the good stuff.

                                    HUBBELL
                    Yes.  Here we go.  No nuns.

                                  FANNY
                    Whoo-hoo.

      Fanny comes up.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                          (under her breath)
                    What do you two think you re doing?

                                    HUBBELL
                    We are about to toast our wedding.

                                  MICHELLE
                    And not do a spit take after.

                                  FANNY
                          (leans in, whispers angry)
                    Have you had sex?

                                  MICHELLE
                          (whispers back)
                    Ever?                                                                                          49.


                                  FANNY
                          (still whispering)
                    Don t be smart.  

                                    HUBBELL
                    Mom, that s none of your business.

                                  FANNY
                          (exploding)
                    This is my party!  I did not throw 
                    this party so the two of you could 
                    have sex during it!

                                  MICHELLE
                          (looking around 
                            uncomfortable as people 
                            stare)
                    Okay, so we ve clearly dropped the 
                      whispering...

                                  FANNY
                    Oh, are you embarrassed?  Am I 
                      embarrassing you by announcing to 
                    the room that you have just had sex 
                    with my son?  You think they don t 
                    know?  That they can t tell?  Your 
                    dress is on backwards!

                                    HUBBELL
                    Okay, you need to calm down...

                                  FANNY
                    I need to calm down?  Oh that s 
                    rich.  You go off on a -
                          (air quotes)
                     Business trip ...

                                  MICHELLE
                      Completely wrong use of air 
                    quotes...

                                  FANNY
                    And you come back and say to me, 
                     here s the cheese you asked me to 
                    pick up in Baker and oh, I got 
                    married !

                                    HUBBELL
                    I m sorry.

                                  FANNY
                    And then you bring her in here and 
                    she proceeds to parade around, in 
                      shorts....                                                                                          50.


                                  MICHELLE
                    What do you have against shorts?

                                  FANNY
                    No real lady wears shorts.

                                  MICHELLE
                    In what century are we having this 
                      conversation?

                                  FANNY
                    Oh, my god!  The quips.  The 
                    chatter.  Do you ever just shut up?

                                    HUBBELL
                    Mother!

      Michelle stares at her a beat then turns and storms out of 
      the house.

                                    HUBBELL (CONT D)
                    Now you listen to me, you can all 
                    listen to me, that woman is my 
                    wife.  I am sorry if I didn t break 
                    it to you the way you would ve 
                    liked, but this is my house and I 
                    will not have her talked to like 
                    that by you or by anyone in this 
                    town!  Got it?!

      Hubbell glares at the room and then heads off passing Truly.

                                  TRULY
                    God.  He s wonderful.

      INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      Hubbell angrily goes to the fridge.  Fanny enters.

                                  FANNY
                    Looking for the pie to throw in my 
                    face?

      Hubbell sighs.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    I mean, you ve done everything else 
                    to humiliate me today.

                                    HUBBELL
                          (slams the fridge shut)
                    Why is there never any food in this 
                    damn house?                                                                                          51.


                                  FANNY
                    Hubbell!

                                    HUBBELL
                          (whirls around on her)
                    I love her.  Do you hear me?

                                  FANNY
                    You don t know her.

                                    HUBBELL
                    I love her.

                                  FANNY
                    You just think --

                                    HUBBELL
                    I love her.

      Fanny realizes he s serious.

                                    HUBBELL (CONT D)
                    Nothing more to say.

      INT. DANCE STUDIO - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

      Sasha, Melanie, and Ginny sit in the middle of the room with 
      a six pack of beer that Sasha has snagged.  Boo is practicing 
      dance steps around them. 

                                  SASHA
                    I think my dad s gay. 

                                    MELANIE
                    Based on what?

                                  SASHA
                          (shrugs)
                    Just a feeling.  

                                  GINNY
                    More dads are these days.

                                    MELANIE
                    I d love to have a gay dad.

                                  GINNY
                    Why?

                                    MELANIE
                    Just seems fun.  Like there would 
                    be a lot of shopping and baking.                                                                                          52.


                                  GINNY
                    You have no idea what you re 
                    talking about.

                                  SASHA
                    Boo!  Beer!

                                  BOO
                    No thanks.

                                  SASHA
                    More for me.

                                  BOO
                    You re going to make yourself sick.

                                  SASHA
                    Am I?
                          (hands her beer to Ginny)
                    Hold please.

      Sasha gets up, faces Boo, takes fifth position, preps and 
      does a perfect triple pirouette, finishes and smiles.

                                  SASHA (CONT D)
                    Two beers I can still do that.  
                    What about you?

                                  BOO
                    You re a mean drunk.  

                                  SASHA
                    I m not drunk.  I m bored.  This 
                    town is -- 
                          (yells)
                    So boring!!

                                  GINNY
                    Maybe.  But the property values are 
                    going through the roof.

                                  SASHA
                          (sighs)
                    I have to get some new friends.

      EXT. DANCE STUDIO - SAME TIME 

      Michelle wanders up.  She hears the girls talking inside.

                                    MELANIE (O.C.)
                    Well, why don t you suck up to 
                    Hubbell s wife?  She can be your 
                    new friend.                                                                                          53.


                                  SASHA (O.C.)
                    God, I can t believe someone 
                    married Hubbell.  Talk about too 
                    many beers.

                                  GINNY (O.C.)
                    What s wrong with Hubbell?

      INT. DANCE STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

                                  SASHA
                    His hair looks like it s on 
                      backwards.

                                    MELANIE
                    Oh my god.  It totally does.

      The door swings open.  The girls jump.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Hiya gals!

      The girls look around guiltily.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Having a little private party?  Can 
                    I crash?

      Michelle takes the beer out of Sasha s hand and looks at it.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                          (feigning disappointment)
                    Domestic?  Really?  See, if you re 
                    going to consume totally empty and 
                    might I add illegal calories then 
                    at least it should be imported.  
                    Something Belgian perhaps.  

      Michelle grabs the rest of the six pack, takes a swig of 
      Sasha s beer and studies the room.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Cool pictures.  Hey, is this you 
                    guys?    

      The girls all look at each other.

                                  BOO
                    That s the Christmas recital.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Nice.  Are you dressed as...socks?                                                                                          54.


                                  GINNY
                    It was an original ballet based on 
                    really bad gifts.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Fanny s a little twisted.  You 
                    gotta give her that.

                                  GINNY
                    So, we heard you re a dancer.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (surprised)
                    You did?

                                    MELANIE
                    Are you?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I am.  

                                  BOO
                    Where do you dance?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, until yesterday, Vegas. 

                                  SASHA
                    You were a showgirl?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yep.  

                                  SASHA
                    So you walked around with feathers 
                    on your head?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Okay,  A  I did not walk, I danced, 
                    and  B , there were a lot of 
                    feathers on my head.  Like a flock 
                    full.  And you think a double 
                    pirouette is hard in point shoes...

                                  SASHA
                    You can do a double pirouette?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I trained at ABT.

      The girls look at her surprised.

                                  GINNY
                    You do ballet?                                                                                          55.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Ever since I was three.

                                    MELANIE
                    How did you end up in Vegas?

                                  MICHELLE
                    It paid better.

                                  SASHA
                    So, not in it for the art of it, 
                    huh?

                                  BOO
                          (softly)
                    Why are you being so mean?
                          (to Michelle)
                    I think Vegas sounds exciting.

                                  MICHELLE
                    It has a lot of Victoria s Secrets.

                                    MELANIE
                    You re the first professional 
                    dancer I ve ever met.  Except for 
                    Fanny.

                                  GINNY
                    Fanny danced with Ballet Russe de 
                    Monte Carlo.

                                  BOO
                          (points to a picture on 
                          the wall)
                    That s her in Copellia.
                          (fixated on the picture)
                    I think being a ballerina is the 
                    most wonderful thing in the world.

                                  MICHELLE
                    You want to be a bunhead, huh?

                                  BOO
                    Next week they re having auditions 
                    for the Joffrey summer program.

                                  SASHA
                    God, I m so tired of hearing about 
                    the Joffrey summer blah, blah, 
                    blah....                                                                                          56.


                                  BOO
                          (getting angry)
                    That s  cause you ll almost 
                      definitely get in.  I d give 
                    anything to get accepted but I 
                    won t.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Why not?

                                  BOO
                    Look at me.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, auditions are tricky.  Do you 
                    have a good audition outfit?

                                  BOO
                    A what?

                                  MICHELLE
                    You have to have a kick ass 
                    audition outfit, something that 
                    makes you feel really powerful.  My 
                    go-to outfit was a fire engine red 
                    unitard, with a thin gold belt that 
                    had a tiny rhinestone charm hanging 
                    from it.  Classy. 

                                  BOO
                    If I wore a red unitard I d look 
                    like a crime scene.

                                  MICHELLE
                      Everyone s outfit differs.  It just 
                    has to make you feel strong.  
                    That s the key to any audition, you 
                    know.  Attitude.

                                  SASHA
                    She s talking about a ballet 
                    audition not a Vegas audition.

                                  MICHELLE
                    An audition is an audition.  You 
                    have to show up confident and ready 
                    to do or be anything they want in 
                    an instant.  I once got a call to 
                    audition for a Broadway show.  
                    Totally last minute.  I grabbed my 
                    bag,ran thirty blocks, walked in 
                    the door - it was for  Dreamgirls .  
                    I was supposed to be black.                                                                                          57.


                                  GINNY
                    No way!

      The girls all laugh.

                                  BOO
                    What happened?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I got a callback.

                                    MELANIE
                    Shut up.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Attitude my friends.

                                  BOO
                    What exactly happens at an 
                    audition?  I mean, what s it like?

                                  MICHELLE
                      Well...it s...

      The girls look at her expectantly.  Even Sasha seems 
      interested.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Okay.  Up. Everybody up.  

      The girls look at each other.  Ginny and Melanie jump up.  
      Boo excitedly joins them.  Sasha stays seated.  

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    So, first we need...

      She spots a post-it pad over on the small check in desk.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Ah ha!

      Michelle goes to the table and quickly writes something on 
      four post-it s.  She heads over to the girls.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)

                    All right ladies, welcome to the 
                    audition for the sequel to  Cats  
                    working title  Dogs .  Sorry about 
                    the sixteen hour wait in the alley.  
                    Didn t know it would rain.  
                    Friggin  weather channel.                                                                                             58.


                                  GINNY
                    Sixteen hour wait?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Every audition makes you wait at 
                    least sixteen hours.

                                    MELANIE
                    That s terrible.

                                  MICHELLE
                    That s show biz.  Okay, here you 
                    go...
                          (she hands each girl a 
                            post-it.  Each post-it 
                          has a number on it)
                    ...That is your number.  Put it on.  
                    Your number is your name for the 
                    duration for the audition.  If we 
                    call number  6  and you don t 
                    answer because you are waiting to 
                    hear  Kathy  you are out of luck.  

                                  BOO
                    This is inhuman.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Okay, numbers on...
                          (holds the last post-it 
                          out to Sasha)
                    You auditioning?

                                  SASHA
                    This is stupid.

                                  MICHELLE
                    If you re not auditioning get your 
                    butt off my floor before someone 
                    jete s through your head.

      Sasha sighs and takes the post-it.  She gets up.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Okay, places on the floor please.  
                    Move, move, move.

      The girls stick their numbers on and spread out on the floor.  
      They assume the positions they usually take during ballet 
      class.  Sasha front and center, Melanie to her left, Ginny to 
      her right, and Boo in the back, hidden behind all of them.  

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                          (looking around)
                    Okay, music, music, music...ah!                                                                                          59.


      She spots an ancient boom box and a pile of cd s.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                          (off the boom box)
                    Wow.  Where s Shabba-doo when you 
                    need him?
                          (flips through the cd s)
                    Okay, what do we have here.  No, 
                    no, no, no, bye...  
                          (tosses a cd over her 
                            shoulder)
                    ...uch!
                          (throws a CD in the trash)
                    Oh!  This will work.  

      She puts a CD in the boom box and presses  play .  The 
      Beatles  I SAW HER STANDING THERE  starts to play.  Michelle 
      takes her place in front of the group.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    A five, six, seven, eight!

      Michelle dances out a few steps. She turns to them.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Got it?

      The girls just look at each other.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Wow.  Okay.  One more time.

      She does the steps again.

                                  SASHA
                    You have to slow it down.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Do I?  I have a job.  Okay, one 
                    time, half speed.

      Michelle works out the routine half speed.  The girls are 
      starting to pick it up.  Especially Boo.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    All right.  From the top!  A five, 
                    six, seven, eight!

      With Michelle in front, they do the routine full speed.  They 
      are fairly successful.  

      Fanny appears in the door.  They don t see her.                                                                                            60.


                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    That last turn is a double, and you 
                    have to give me an end.  A real 
                    clean end.  Got it?  Good.  This 
                    time by yourselves.  Ready?  Five, 
                    six, seven, eight!

      The girls try it without Michelle.  They are a little 
      hesitant and super sloppy.  Sasha especially seems to be 
      having trouble remembering the routine.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Oh my god.  Terrible.  Where s the 
                    attitude?

                                  SASHA
                    It s too fast.

                                  MICHELLE
                    It s as fast as it s supposed to 
                    be.  Last time half speed.  

      ANGLE ON: FANNY WATCHING MICHELLE TAKE THESE KIDS THROUGH THE 
      DANCE.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Okay, now this one s for the job.  
                    Impress me!  Five, six, seven, 
                    eight!

      The girls dance the routine.  This time with more confidence.  
      All except Sasha.  She s having trouble so she s pretending 
      not to care, not really trying.  

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Again!

      They do the routine again.  Fanny watches fascinated.  This 
      time Ginny forgets about her boob size.  Melanie almost 
      straightens up completely.  But the revelation is Boo.  She 
      is nailing this routine.  Michelle watches her.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Okay!  Better.  Number 6! 

      The girls look at her confused.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Yo!  6!  Who s number six?

      The girls remember to check their numbers.

                                  BOO
                    Oh, me.  I m 6!  I m 6!                                                                                          61.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Great.  6 up front, number 12, back 
                    where 6 was. 

      Boo looks around a beat.  Sasha realizes she s number 12.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Let s go girls. I have forty 
                    thousand people waiting outside in 
                      a tsunami.

                                  SASHA
                    But...I did the whole thing that 
                    time.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Just switching things up.  12 in 
                    back.  Let s move.

      A stunned Sasha moves to the back.  Ginny and Melanie look at 
      each other shocked.  Sasha in the back, Boo in the front?  
      What the hell is going on?

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Okay!  Everything you have!  Five, 
                    six, seven, eight.

      The girls dance their hearts out.  Sasha frowns, suddenly 
      dancing as hard as she can.  For once she s really trying.  
      And Boo beams.  She s front and center for the first time 
      ever and she earning every second of it.  

      The music ends and the girls hit their last poses.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Great.  Thank you, ladies.  Leave 
                    your numbers at the door.  We will 
                    call you.  Or not.  Yo, 6!

      Boo comes up to her.  Michelle grins at her.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Joffrey s gonna get rocked next 
                    week. 

      Boo looks so happy she might cry.  

                                  BOO
                          (whispers)
                    Thank you.

      Michelle notices Fanny standing at the door.                                                                                          62.


                                  MICHELLE
                    You guys, you should get going now.

                                  GINNY
                    That was fun!

      Melanie, Ginny and Boo rush out.

                                    MELANIE
                    Boo, you were so good!

                                  BOO
                    I know, right?

      Sasha grabs her shoes and turns to Michelle.

                                  SASHA
                    Next week s audition is ballet.  
                    With toe shoes.  Totally different.

      She storms out.  Michelle looks at Fanny.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I was just showing the girls what 
                    it was like to audition.

                                  FANNY
                    For what?

                                  MICHELLE
                     Dogs .  It s a sequel to  Cats .
                          (beat)
                    I made it up.

                                  FANNY
                          (beat)
                    Let s go.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Go?  Where?

      Fanny s gone. Michelle looks after her confused.

                                                                          FADE OUT:


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                          63.


                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN: 

      EXT. OYSTER SHACK BAR - NIGHT

      We PUSH IN on a creaky crumbly but apparently hugely popular 
      dive bar.  Fanny, with Michelle in tow, marches right up to 
      the enormous man perched on a stool outside the door.  He 
      opens it for her like she s the queen.  

      INT. OYSTER SHACK BAR - LATER

      It s sticky, darkly lit, and not the place to order a mojito, 
      but the jukebox is full and always on.  Fanny and Michelle 
      enter.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    What happened to this being a  dry  
                    town?

                                  FANNY
                    Who said that?

      Fanny sits at the bar.  Michelle sits next to her.  

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                          (to the bartender)
                    Sonya dear, two shots.  Jack 
                    Daniels.  And leave the bottle.
                          (to Michelle)
                    What s the matter?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Nothing.  This is just...weird.

                                  FANNY
                    What, sitting here?  You re used to 
                    dancing on top of the bar, is that 
                    it?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Okay, see I was not a stripper.  Or 
                    a hooker, or a Playmate.  

                                  FANNY
                    I know.  
                          (beat)
                    I googled you.

                                  MICHELLE
                    You did?                                                                                          64.


                                  FANNY
                    You re surprised?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, you have a boom box.

                                  FANNY
                    I am not one of those old women who 
                    can t use a computer.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    And that CD collection.

                                  FANNY
                    What s wrong with my CD collection?

                                  MICHELLE
                    So sad.  You have got to give those 
                    poor girls some better music or 
                    there s going to be an uprising.  

                                  FANNY
                    Oh please.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I m just saying, it s Arab Spring 
                    if you don t discover iTunes 
                    pronto.

                                  FANNY
                    I teach ballet.  Classical ballet.  
                    Those cd s are for fun.

      Sonja pours two shots and leaves the bottle.

                                  MICHELLE
                    What s fun about Rick Astly?

                                  FANNY
                    You should ve been a radio 
                      personality.  Or an auctioneer.  
                    Instead you decided to dance.

      She picks up her shot.  Michelle follows suit.  

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    To Hubbell.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I will drink to that.

      They knock them back.  Fanny pours them two more.                                                                                          65.


                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    You ve done this before.

                                  FANNY
                    Of course I have.  There s no movie 
                    theatre in this town.

      They knock back the shots.  Fanny pours them two more.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    ABT.  Full scholarship.  Accepted 
                    into the company at 17.  Very 
                      impressive.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Thank you.  

                                  FANNY
                    And then after a few years you left 
                    the company, did some chorus work 
                    on Broadway, and then...Vegas. 

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yep.

                                  FANNY
                    Did you get injured?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No.

                                  FANNY
                    Have a break-down?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No.

                                  FANNY
                    Double cross a bookie?

                                  MICHELLE
                      I just...needed a change.

                                  FANNY
                    So, you picked Vegas.  That was 
                      different.

      Fanny tosses back another shot.  She refills her glass.

                                  MICHELLE
                    A friend of mine got a job at 
                    Ceasers and asked if I wanted to 
                    come along and I did.  I thought it 
                    would be temporary.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                          66.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    It was fun for a while.  Dance, 
                    party all night, sleep all day.  
                    And then...
                          (she shrugs)
                    ...Time slips away, you know?

                                  FANNY
                    I do know.  I know very well.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I hear you danced with Ballet 
                    Russe.

                                  FANNY
                    I did.  I was a soloist.

                                  MICHELLE
                    That s amazing.  When did you 
                    retire?

                                  FANNY
                    When I got pregnant.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Oh.  How very  Turning Point .  

                                  FANNY
                    It was unplanned, and I thought 
                    well, I can go back after I have 
                    the baby, but the father did not 
                    decide to stay around and bills had 
                    to be paid, so I started teaching 
                    to make ends meet and...well, time 
                    slips away, you know?

      Michelle drinks her drink.  Fanny fills her glass back up.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    You squandered a lot of potential.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I know.

                                  FANNY
                    Are you sorry?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Every day of my life.  I was a 
                    really stupid twenty year old.

                                  FANNY
                      Everyone s stupid in their 
                    twenties.                                                                                          67.


                                  MICHELLE
                    No, I was really really stupid.  I 
                    had all the gifts, all the tools, I 
                    just had absolutely no focus.

                                  FANNY
                    Just like Sasha.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yeah, what s with that kid?  She 
                    doesn t seem to like dancing at 
                    all.

                                  FANNY
                    Sasha doesn t know what she likes.  
                    Her mother is, well, she travels a 
                    lot.  And her father is gay.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Really.

                                  FANNY
                    He won t come out.  He thinks it s 
                    a giant secret but everyone knows.  
                    It s too bad.  There are some 
                    lovely single gay men in this town 
                    and Sasha would be so much happier 
                    if he smiled once in a while.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, everyone in their own time, I 
                    guess.

                                  FANNY
                    That s crap.  Every moment you 
                    waste in life is a sin.  Nothing 
                    waits for you.  It all just moves 
                    on.  Then you turn around one day 
                    and your son is married.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Look how you brought that back 
                    around to me.  Nice moves.

                                  FANNY
                    Do you love him?

                                  MICHELLE
                    He knows I don t.  

                                  FANNY
                    He thinks love will come.                                                                                          68.


                                  MICHELLE
                    It could.  He s a terrific guy.

                                  FANNY
                    And what about you?  Are you a 
                    terrific girl?

                                  MICHELLE
                    I m super handy around the house.

                                  FANNY
                    That might be better then love, 
                    actually.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I know you think I m some flighty 
                    bimbo who s using your son and is 
                    going to break his heart.

                                  FANNY
                    Okay.

                                  MICHELLE
                    I didn t plan this.  He just caught 
                    me at a really bad time.  My career 
                    is pointless, my apartment is a 
                      nightmare, I m sick of partying, 
                    I m sick of Vegas.  I m sick of me, 
                    actually.  I don t know what I m 
                    doing, or where I m going and he s 
                    just so kind.  I ve never had 
                    someone so kind in my life.  I 
                    think I could fall in love with 
                    him.  I d sure like myself a lot 
                    more if I did.

                                  FANNY
                    Have you ever thought about 
                    teaching?  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Teaching what?

                                  FANNY
                    Dance?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Uh no.

                                  FANNY
                    I watched you with those kids.  
                    With Boo.  It was something to see.                                                                                          69.


                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, thanks but...

                                  FANNY
                    My studio does not make a lot of 
                    money.  Half the kids are on 
                      scholarship because their parents 
                    are out of work and I don t believe 
                    in turning anyone away who wants to 
                    dance.  But, if I could add some 
                    classes, jazz, modern, maybe I 
                    could build it up a bit.  I can t 
                    do that by myself.  And since you 
                    will now be living here I thought 
                    maybe you d like to contribute 
                      something.  Think about it.

      Fanny gets up, goes over to the jukebox, and picks a tune.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    I love my son.  I want him to be 
                    happy.  So...  

      JIM CROCE S  YOU DON T MESS AROUND WITH JIM  plays.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    ...let s see if you and I can dance 
                    together.

                                  MICHELLE
                    To this?

                                  FANNY
                          (starting to dance)
                    I love Jim Croce.  

                                  MICHELLE
                    Okay, seriously, iTunes.

                                  FANNY
                    Get over here right now.

      Fanny takes Michelle s hands and starts to jitterbug.

                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                    My God, you re terrible at this.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Well, you made me be the guy.

                                  FANNY
                    Just follow me.

      Michelle stares at Fanny s feet mimicking her.                                                                                          70.


                                  FANNY (CONT D)
                          (sings)
                     You don t tug on Superman s cape, 
                    you don t spit into the wind, you 
                    don t pull the mask off the ol  
                    lone ranger and you don t mess 
                    around with Jim ...

                                  MICHELLE
                    Hey, I think I m getting it.

      She is.  They are now dancing as a unit.  And they look 
      pretty damn good together.  Other people have joined them on 
      the dance floor.  The place is starting to feel like a party.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT D)
                    Maybe this is gonna work!

                                  FANNY
                    Maybe!

                                  MICHELLE
                    So tell me, that Michael guy, you 
                    two have some sort of creepy Sunset 
                    Boulevard thing going?

                                  FANNY
                    Just dance please!

      The door to the bar opens.  The local CHIEF OF POLICE comes 
      in followed by Michael.  Michael spots them on the floor.

                                    MICHAEL
                    There they are.

      He rushes over and grabs Fanny.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                          (clearly upset)
                    Fanny, I need you to come with me.

                                  FANNY
                    There s a bottle on the bar.  Pour 
                    yourself a shot and get out here.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yes.  There are some unanswered 
                    questions you can help us with.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Please.  We have to go.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Where?                                                                                          71.


      Fanny notices Michael s face.  She stops dancing.

                                  FANNY
                    Michael, what s the matter?

      Michael looks at Michelle, then back to Fanny.

                                    MICHAEL
                      Hubbell...

                                  MICHELLE
                          (getting concerned)
                    What about Hubbell?

                                    MICHAEL
                          (blurting it out)
                    He didn t know where you two had 
                    gone.  He went driving around 
                    looking for you.  And, you know 
                    that damn blind corner on Myrtle -  
                    how many times have we asked for a 
                    stop sign, or a flashing light 
                    or...  

                                  FANNY
                    Michael!  What s happened?

                                    MICHAEL
                          (he can t look at her)
                    It just came out of nowhere...

      Michael shakes his head.  Hubbell s gone.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, honey.

      Fanny and Michelle stand there frozen.  The music plays, the 
      bar patrons dance on as if nothing at all has changed.  But 
      everything has.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
