LONG, WIDE BEACH.
DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.
Unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears
to be playing on a television screen.
A sandy-haired, SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, runs towards a bluff on
the beach.
The boy's father, KIRK, late-thirties, beer bottle in hand,
flirts with two TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline.
Suddenly, the
father remembers his son.
He looks anxiously around.
The sight
of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his
bottle in the sand and run to him.
The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father
comes within earshot.
FATHER
(out of breath, clutching his side)
Truman!
Truman!
Stop!
Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his
father.
But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the
anger and distress on his father's face.
FATHER
Come down now!
His father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more
tantalizing.
The boy considers defying his father.
He puts
his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at
the other side.
One good stretch would do it.
FATHER
(reading Truman's mind, enraged)
No!
TRUMAN
(sensing his father is keeping
something from him)
Why?
What's there?
FATHER
(unconvincing)
Nothing's there.
It's the same as this.
(trace of desperation)
Come down, please!
Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other BEACHGOERS
have stopped their activities to stare at him.
Reluctantly
he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks.
When he finally
jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and
drags him away down the beach.
FATHER
I told you to stay close.
Don't ever leave
my sight again.
You gotta know your
limitations.
You could've been washed
away by the tide.
LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.
MORNING.
TRUMAN emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks
briskly down the bustling street.
A snarl of taxis, buses and
COMMUTER traffic.
A STREET VENDOR thrusts a pretzel under
Truman's nose, a CAREER WOMAN catches his eye.
Truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of
Cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy
pages.
Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and
finding him busy with another customer, Truman deftly tears a
portion of the open page and pockets the cutting.
He guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the
Newspaper Vendor standing close behind him.
TRUMAN
(quickly recovering)
Gimme a copy of "The Sydney Morning Herald".
VENDOR
We ran out.
TRUMAN
(hastily departing)
Thanks anyway.
As Truman hurries away, the Vendor picks up the copy of Cosmo
and instantly turns to the torn page.
It is a Lancome
advertisement with ISABELLA ROSSELLINI's nose missing.
Truman is still in view but the Vendor makes no effort to
confront him, almost as if he were expecting it.
Passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow
out of the pavement, Truman glimpses himself in the reflective
glass.
He doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his
gut, but quickly concedes defeat.
The image triggers another
childhood memory.
LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.
MORNING.
From TRUMAN'S POV we see that he is staring up at relief
letters that proclaim, "American Life & Accident Insurance,
Inc." above an office building's entrance.
A POLICE OFFICER walking his beat, wanders in Truman's
direction.
From another angle, we observe Truman from the
Police Officer's POV - shaky, handheld camera - on a television
screen.
Truman enters the building.
CITY PARK.
DAY.
TRUMAN eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park.
From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, "To The
Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration".
A TRANSIENT in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout.
Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders
and gives him it all, his appetite gone.
As the transient
wheels himself away, Truman loses himself in his book.
LONG ISLAND SOUND.
DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.
The flashback once again appearing an a television screen, the
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits alongside his father, KIRK, in a
small sailing dinghy.
TRUMAN
(shouting above the wind)
Let's go further, daddy!
Let's go further!
FATHER
(shouting back)
It's getting late, Truman.
TRUMAN
(entreating his father)
Please!...
Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading
towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon.
BAY STREET, STATEN ISLAND.
DAY.
TRUMAN finally reaches his destination at a well-to-do
condominium on Bay Street.
As he approaches the lobby, he
realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his
suit jacket.
TRUMAN'S HOUSE.
DUSK.
The backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home.
Beyond
the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy
Expressway.
TRUMAN wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, MERYL,
pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry.
She has a
sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new
knife-set in a wooden block.
She kisses Truman affectionately
on the cheek.
MERYL
(proudly referring to the knife-set)
I got it free with the tune-up.
Looking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch
of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes.
MERYL
You missed a section.
Meryl enters the house.
Truman restarts the lawnmower and
obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.
As
the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass,
Truman pulls back abruptly.
He checks the kitchen window for
Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut.
UNOPENED FREEWAY.
NIGHT.
An abandoned freeway project in Queens.
The four hundred yard
stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked.
At one end
is an off-ramp that abruptly ends in inid-air, reinforcing steel
protuding from the concrete.
TRUMAN stands at the end of the off-ramp with MARLON, thirty-
two, the kind of physique some descibe as fat, others big.
Marlon drinks beer from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up
golf ball with a number three wood.
Truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the
ball.
The ball arches away into the night sky, lit by the
adjacent operating roadway.
From a new angle we see the ball
take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and
continue down the asphalt.
Marlon tosses Truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred
golf balls - a ball initialed with the letter, "T".
Truman sets
the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into
his second shot.
With a slight fade, the second ball carries
even further than the first.
Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment.
Marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot.
MARLON
Ouch.
Whose nuts were those?
TRUMAN
(opening a beer from the six pack)
Mine.
Marlon tees up a ball of his own. initialed with the letter "M".
TRUMAN
I gotta get out, Marlon.
MARLON
(mild interest only)
Yeah?
Outta what?
TRUMAN
Outta my job, outta Queens...out!
Marlon takes a practise swing.
MARLON
Outta your job?
What the hell's wrong
with your job?
You gotta great job.
You gotta desk job.
I'd kill for a desk
job.
Marlon addresses the ball and swings.
A sweeping hook shot
that bounces off the freeway out of bounds.
MARLON
(annoyed by the errant tee shot)
Sonofabitch.
TRUMAN
It doesn't mean anything.
MARLON
(still looking in the
direction of his ball)
Nothing means anything.
Try stocking vending
machines for a living.
My biggest decision
of the day is whether the Almond Joys look
better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths.
Truman selects another "M" ball from the bucket and tosses it to
Marlon.
TRUMAN
(adamant)
I gotta get out.
Overcompensating with his second shot, Marlon slices the ball in
the other direction.
A lucky bounce keeps it on the cement
fairway.
MARLON
(skeptical, picking up his beer)
Sure and go where?
Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer.
TRUMAN
(unable to disguise his reverence)
Australia.
MARLON
(impressed)
No shit.
Where is Australia exactly?
Near England?
Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate.
He points to a
dimple on his make-shift globe.
TRUMAN
See here, this is Queens.
(sliding his finger around
the other side of the ball)
All the way round here, Australia.
You
can't get any further away before you start
coming back.
(tossing the world in his hand,
warming to his subject)
Y'know, there're still places in Australia
where no human being has ever set foot.
MARLON
(still dubious)
So when are you leaving?
TRUMAN
It's not that simple.
Takes money, planning.
You can't just up and go.
(heading off Marlon's skepticism)
Oh, I'm gonna do it, don't worry about
that.
I just gotta move slow.
Pick a
moment.
Bonus time's just around the
corner.
Soon as I get a retaining wall
built on the back of the house I can
start thinking about selling up...and I'll be
gone.
Up and away on that big steel bird.
(as if to convince himself)
I'm going, don't you worry about that.
Marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is beyond
his imagination.
MARLON
I never knew anybody who got out.
An awkward moment.
Truman, once again, not so sure of himself.
He masks his doubt by teeing up another ball.
DISSOLVE TO
FREEWAY.
LATER THAT NIGHT.
TRUMAN and MARLON wander down the empty freeway, retrieving
the golf balls.
As they return them to the bucket they check
the initial on each ball to determine the winner of their
long-drive competition.
TRUMAN
(slightly the worse for drink)
Tick-fucking-tock.
That's the fucking
problem, Marlon.
I'm thirty-four.
I'm
older than Jesus Christ.
Marlon looks sideways at Truman.
It sounds to him like the beer
talking.
TRUMAN
Where do the dreams go, Marlon?
MARLON
(picking up the last ball marked with an
initial "T", trying to ignore the question)
You win.
TRUMAN
I'm serious.
Where do the dreams go?
MARLON
(humoring his maudlin friend)
They're still there.
Just buried under what
we settled for.
They approach Truman's Oldsmobile.
Truman opens the trunk to
deposit their humble golfing equipment.
Inside are the remains
of the fallen light fixture.
TRUMAN
(referring to the light)
You really think it could've dropped off an
airliner?
MARLON
(unimpressed)
Sure.
It's halogen.
You oughta report it.
(quickly changing the subject)
You coming for a drink?
TRUMAN
I can't tonight.
EATON'S NECK POINT, LONG ISLAND.
NIGHT, PRESENT.
A smaller, more simple wreath lands on the calm, dark water
beyond the jetty twenty-seven years later.
TRUMAN stares at the
wreath for a long moment, turns and wanders back towards the
shoreline.
In his work suit minus his shoes and socks, he sits on the sand.
He has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and
points a corded microphone at the surf.
For a long while we
watch Truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the
lapping waves, staring up at the handful of stars visible
through the gloom.
We focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse.
From the
light's POV, through the green hue of a night vision camera, we
observe Truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water.
TRUMAN
(shouting at the surf)
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
A NIGHTWATCHMAN'S OFFICE SOMEWHERE.
NIGHT.
In a nightwatchman's office, two UNIFORMED GUARDS drink coffee.
GUARD 1
How can they have a child?
GUARD 2
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
GUARD 1
Why not?
GUARD 2
You think she'd go through with it?
(reassessing his own opinion)
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
LONG ISLAND SOUND.
DAWN, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.
As always the flashback appears to play on a television screen.
The SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits on the upturned hull of a small
dinghy in calm, deep water.
TRUMAN
(plaintively calling into the mist)
Daddy!!...Daddy!!...
His cries go unanswered.
LOWER MANHATTAN.
MORNING.
TRUMAN emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the
newspaper stand. He picks up a copy of Vogue and flips through
the glossy cosmetic ads, surreptitiously tearing CLAUDIA
SCHIFFER's nose from one of the pages.
He returns the magazine
to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the
rush hour pedestrian traffic.
Pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building, he
glimpses the reflection of a HOMELESS MAN standing directly
behind him.
Truman, spellbound by the man, suddenly wheels
around to face him.
The Homeless Han is in his late-sixties.
more well-groomed and well-fed than the average vagrant, with a
serene smile on his face.
From a new angle we see a two-shot of Truman and the Man on a
television screen.
The Homeless Man places his hand ever so
gently on Truman's cheek.
Truman makes no effort to withdraw.
He is transfixed by the the man's eyes.
He appears to recognize
him.
TRUMAN
(almost to himself, mouthing
the word)
Daddy...
Suddenly a distinguished OLD WOMAN walking a small dog and a
YOUNG MALE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE carrying a briefcase, walking in
opposite directions along the sidewalk, grab the Homeless Man,
one taking each arm.
A bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group,
doors already open, and before Truman can react, the Old Woman
and the Young Executive force the Homeless Man onto the bus.
Truman lurches after them, but he is met by the bus doors,
closing sharply in his face.
TRUMAN
(to BUS DRIVER)
Hey, stop!
Stop!!
Truman thumps against the doors, but the BUS DRIVER ignores his
cries and the bus roars away from the curb.
He starts to run
after the bus, colliding with several PEDESTRIANS who make no
attempt to avoid him.
Stepping blindly into the street, he tries to hail a taxi.
A vacant cab suddenly switches off its "FOR HIRE" light as he
reaches it.
Truman pleads with the TAXI DRIVER through the
closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is
apparently oblivious to Truman's shouts.
Frantic, Truman, dashes into a nearby parking structure and
grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised
parking attendant's kiosk.
Running along the rows of parked
cars, Truman desperately presses the car security buttons
attached to the key rings
A car alarm chirps and Truman turns in time to see the car's
winking sidelights.
He jumps inside a brand new BMW and guns
the car.
The PARKING ATTENDANT, alerted by the squealing tires,
appears from the Men's Room and attempts to wave Truman down.
ATTENDANT
(running after the car)
Hey!
Truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street
without looking, causing a taxi and a postal van to take
evasive action.
Catching sight of the bus in the distance, Truman leans on the
car's horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists.
He is
only a couple of car-lengths from the bus.
TRUMAN
(reading aloud, the
ID number of the bus)
Two, four, oh, six.
Suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to
slow for no apparent reason.
Truman looks for a way around
but the cars crab across the street, blocking any passage,
working together almost as if they are running interference.
TRUMAN
(shouting at the cars)
Outta the way!
Outta the way!
The bus is escaping.
Truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car, scattering
PEDESTRIANS.
The same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his
progress suddenly accelerate in unison, anticipating his move.
By the time Truman reaches the end of the sidewalk, the cars are
clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam.
Truman
spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and
disappear from view.
Fumbling with the gear stick. he finally finds reverse but turns
to find a hostile group of PEDESTRIANS herded tightly together
behind the car, leaving Truman with nowhere left to go.
The car door is suddenly jerked open and the out-of-breath
PARKING ATTENDANT yanks Truman from the driver's seat.
ATTENDANT
What the fuck are you trying to pull?!
TRUMAN
(cowering, the fight instantly
gone out of him)
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
No harm done!
No harm done!
ATTENDANT
(feverishly inspecting the
fenders for dents, he finds none)
I oughta fuck you up!
The Attendant looks into Truman's terrified eyes.
They get
the better of him.
ATTENDANT
Get the fuck outta here.
The Attendant shoves Truman's briefcase into his arms and
brushes him aside.
As he departs, Truman notices that the
traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of
pedestrians has dissolved.
BUS DEPOT.
DAY.
Row after row of parked buses.
TRUMAN and MARLON exit an
administration office.
Instead of heading for the exit, Truman
begins marching down the first row of buses, inspecting the
number painted on the rear of each one.
MARLON
What're you doing?
(gesturing to the office)
The man told you there's no such bus.
TRUMAN
He's lying.
Two, four, oh, six was
definitely the number.
Marlon stops walking.
Truman continues his inspection.
Seeing
there is no reasoning with him, Marlon hurries to catch him up.
TRUMAN
I never believed he was dead.
MARLON
(trying to be patient)
C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find
a body.
You know what the currents are like
in that water.
TRUMAN
(shudders, a memory
flashing in his head)
You had to see his face when that wave hit.
He wasn't scared Marion.
It was like he
was expecting it, waiting for it.
He
knew it was coming.
MARLON
Why would he fake it?
(trying to make light)
He's not Elvis Presley.
TRUMAN
(ignoring the joke, pondering
the morning's events)
You know what was really strange about today?
An old woman with a little dog and a
businessman, walking in opposite directions
on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork.
They force him onto a bus against his will,
a bus that doesn't normally stop outside
my building.
And when I'm giving chase, the
bus never makes another stop and I get the
feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians
are working together to make sure I never
catch up with it.
MARLON
(sarcastic)
Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and
the buses and the cars?
What are you
saying, the entire population of Lower
Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding
out that your father staged his death to
pursue a life as a street person?
Oh yeah,
that makes sense.
Truman has no answer.
We see an aerial shot of Truman and
Marlon on a television screen, continuing to check the rows of
buses, Marlon still marveling at Truman's obstinance.
They
have come to the last bus in the final row.
Truman hangs his
head.
The offending bus is not amongst them.
He makes towards
the exit without comment and Marlon follows.
Unseen by the pair, we focus on the ID number on one of the
buses they have previously checked - "2400".
A single drip of
black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit.
MANHATTAN STREET.
DAY.
TRUMAN and MARLON, drinking beer, sit in the rear doorway of
Marion's delivery van, wholesale-sized boxes of candy stacked
behind them.
TRUMAN
You think I imagined it, don't you?
MARLON
I think you're missing your dad.
(trying to be delicate)
The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?
Truman is surprised Marlon remembered.
Marlon nods to the
sidewalk.
MARLON
You got sand in your cuffs.
Truman looks down at his feet.
A small, tell-tale pile of sand
has poured out of his tight trouser cuff.
TRUMAN
Maybe you're right.
If only the old
woman hadn't left her dog behind.
We see a flashback in Truman's head of the earlier scene in the
Lower Manhattan street.
It confirms that the old woman's DOG
was abandoned on the sidewalk.
LONG ISLAND SOUND.
DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.
A younger-looking CHRISTOF sits in a motorboat in the calm
water of Long Island Sound.
Truman's father, KIRK, twenty-seven
years younger and a DARK HAIRED BOY, Truman's age at the time,
acting as a stand-in, sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy.
Two SCUBA DIVERS in the ocean.
YOUNG CHRISTOF
(barking instructions to Kirk)
...as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward...
Kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction.
YOUNG CHRISTOF
The freak wave will strike from the
starboard side.
Remember, you don't
go to the diver.
The diver goes to you.
To simulate the wave, one of the divers puts his full weight on
the side of the dinghy to capsize it.
Kirk and the boy are
tossed into the water.
While the boy immediately bobs to the
surface in his life jacket, Kirk fails to surface.
After a long
moment, he reappears with the second diver some distance away.
now wearing a spare aqualung.
YOUNG CHRISTOF
...Good!
Good!...of course, on the day you
only surface once you're safely beyond the
cove...Try it one more time...You okay?
Kirk is staring at Truman's stand-in, clinging to the upturned
boat.
Kirk's expression suggests he is not a totally willing
participant in the masquerade.
The present-day Christof freezes the monitor on Kirk's uncertain
face.
CAR WASH.
DUSK.
TRUMAN ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly
washed Oldsmobile.
In the background is the warning sign he
has just ignored, "CLOSE WINDOWS, LOWER AERIALS".
Truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender
cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the
severed aerial.
DRUG STORE.
DUSK.
Still shaken by his experience with the radio, TRUMAN exits
a Drug Store with a small, brown paper bag.
Out of the corner
of his eye he catches a MALE BYSTANDER still checking his right
ear with his finger.
He goes to say something to the by-stander
but thinks better of it.
REDLIGHT DISTRICT, QUEENS.
NIGHT.
HOOKERS in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares.
TRUMAN cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile, the expression of
the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each
is by-passed.
Suddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy,
prostitute, VERONICA, wearing a platinum blonde wig.
She is in
deep discussion with a fellow WORKING GIRL.
Veronica recognizes
the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window.
VERONICA
Hey, Truman!
Where you bin?
You bin
cheatin' on me?
Veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger
seat.
FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.
DUSK.
The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and LAUREN enter the park near the
Unisphere.
The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
We knew we were taking a risk.
She hadn't
been properly coached, but we were torn...
He'd summoned the courage to make the
approach...We wanted to reward that.
Of
course she took full advantage...
Truman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding
the steel sculpture.
LAUREN
I never knew this place existed.
They both stare down at the inviting water.
Lauren suddenly
throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another
thought.
She comes splashing to the surface.
Truman stares
down, transfixed hy the shimmering water.
LAUREN
Come on!
Come on!
It's wonderful!
TRUMAN
(nervous)
I...I can't.
Lauren suddenly stops splashing.
LAUREN
That's right.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
She quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet.
TRUMAN
(confused)
Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about.
Has someone been talking to you?
Lauren wrings out her dress.
LAUREN
(to the sky, upset)
Get me out of here.
I don't want to
be here.
Lauren starts walking away.
TRUMAN
(confused, calling after her)
What are you talking about?
Lauren!
Lauren!
Truman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing
her to face him.
LAUREN
(distraught)
My name's not Lauren!
It's Sylvia!
Truman looks into her eyes and believes her.
THE PICTURE FAST-FORWARDS AGAIN AT HIGH SPEED FOR A MOMENT AND
RETURNS TO NORMAL.
TRUMAN and SYLVIA (as she is now called throughout the remainder
of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as
Truman and the hooker, Veronica, seventeen years later.
As we
have just seen imitated, Sylvia and Truman kiss with great
delicacy.
Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips
with her finger.
SYLVIA
In a minute someone's going to come and
stop me talking to you.
TRUMAN
(looking around the deserted park)
Who?
There's no one around.
SYLVIA
(covering his lips once again)
You remember when you were a little boy,
you stood up in class and said you wanted
to be an explorer like Magellan.
And your
teacher, Sister Olivia said, "You're too
late, Truman.
There's nothing left to
explore."
And all the other kids laughed.
And you sat down.
TRUMAN
(incredulous)
How do you know about that?
SYLVIA
It doesn't matter.
You've forgotten about
that boy, Truman.
You got scared.
Just
because something happens, doesn't mean you
can't take another chance in your life.
TRUMAN
I don't understand.
SYLVIA
(looking over her shoulder nervously)
There isn't much time.
Just listen.
Everybody's pretending Truman.
Everybody
but you.
(pointing to the
buildings on the horizon)
Look at that project.
You think anybody
lives there?
It's all for you, Truman.
A show.
The eyes are everywhere.
TRUMAN
(protesting)
Eyes?
Where?
SYLVIA
(frustrated, raving)
Everywhere, disguised...Truman, they're
going to fill your head with lies.
You've got to make yourself deaf, you
understand?
When you're afraid the most, it
means you're on the right track.
Trust that
boy.
Promise me you'll do that?
Truman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making.
Suddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of
nowhere.
SYLVIA
(scared)
I told you, Truman!
The car skids to a stop and a large MAN, 40ish, with a shock of
dark hair jumps from the car.
The man yanks the frightened
Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground.
TRUMAN
(shocked)
Hey!
MAN
(to Sylvia)
Get in the car, Lauren!
Truman jumps up.
TRUMAN
(to the Man)
Who are you?!
MAN
I'm her father!
SYLVIA
No he's not!
He's just saying that!
Does he look anything like me?!
TRUMAN
Shut your mouth!
The man backhands Sylvia roughly across the face and bundles
her into his car.
Truman rushes at the man.
TRUMAN
Leave her alone!
The man easily fends Truman off, knocking him to the ground.
He slams shut the passenger door of the Plymouth.
MAN
(to Sylvia)
I told you not to come here anymore!
(to Truman, who is getting
to his feet)
Which one are you?
Truman is suddenly struck dumb, the doubts start crowding back
into his head.
SYLVIA
(calling out from the car)
Don't listen to him, Truman.
Make yourself
deaf.
Come find me.
MAN
(to Truman, getting into the car)
Don't bother!
We're moving to Australia.
New York's done something to her head.
The Plymouth roars away.
Truman stares after it and then
turns back to the cardigan left on the ground.
CHRISTOF (V.O.)
Why did he say Australia?
Why couldn't he
have said New Jersey?
FLUSHING MEADOW.
DUSK, PRESENT DAY.
VERONICA'S head suddenly appears back in frame beside TRUMAN.
VERONICA
You want me to do it again?
I think I
could do it better.
TRUMAN
(coming back to reality)
No...thank you.
Truman picks up the cardigan.
They return to the car.
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
DAY.
Close up on a nose.
We pull back to reveal that the nose
belongs to SYLVIA, seventeen years older than Truman's composite
picture - slimmer in the face, wearing her hair shorter.
She is standing at the water's edge on a long, deserted
windswept beach, several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the
high-water line.
In the background, a solitary, white
beachfront house - an other-worldliness to the idyllic scene.
Looking up into the sky, Sylvia's attention is drawn to a piece
of paper carried on the ocean breeze.
The paper catches on the
mast of one of the sailing dinghys.
A page from a newspaper,
carrying a photograph of TRUMAN in the street where he
encountered his father.
Sylvia retrieves the page.
The
article's headline reads, "TRUMAN'S FATE IN DOUBT".
Spying a MAN, late-thirties, kindly face, riding up to the beach
house on an old bicycle, Sylvia secrets the page under her
sweater.
The man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on
the sand.
Sylvia waves cheerfully back.
TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.
MORNING.
TRUMAN sits in his car, about to lace his coffee.
From inside
the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar
excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN.
Truman suddenly
throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across
the parking lot and into the school.
LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.
MORNING.
TRUMAN exits the subway, still lost in thought.
He stops at
the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his
ritual search but his heart is not in it.
He starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection
in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will
appear at his side once again.
But no one joins him.
However, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself
that takes his interest.
An imposing forty-story office
building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of
reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a
building Truman passes every day.
As usual, a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and
exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating
security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS.
Beyond security
are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and
delivery personnel to and from their floors of business.
Truman abruptly enters the building.
He strides confidently
past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs.
SECURITY GUARD 1
(to Truman)
Can I help?
TRUMAN
(sneaking a glance at the
building directory)
I have an appointment at, er...Diamond
Enterprises.
SECURITY GUARD 1
They went bust.
The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block
Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind
and makes a dash for it.
He slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing,
defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard.
A WOMAN
EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman.
The cause
of her concern becomes all too apparent.
Looking beyond the
woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator
car.
The elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building.
Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that
the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with
no floors above the ground floor.
The PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other
elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on
folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary
curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator
cars.
Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn
stares back, appalled.
The Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take
him by the arm.
SECURITY GUARD 1
You gotta leave.
TRUMAN
(riveted by the equally-stunned
building occupants)
What're they doing?
SECURITY GUARD 2
You gotta leave.
The Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an
Emergency Exit.
TRUMAN
(not going quietly)
Just tell me what the hell's going on?
SECURITY GUARD 1
We're re-modelling.
TRUMAN
Like fuck!
What're they doing?
LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.
DAY.
TRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the
street.
TRUMAN
You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!
SECURITY GUARD 2
Investigate what?
You're trespassing!
Truman sees there is no point in arguing further.
His
shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY.
A thought
occurs to him.
He starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another
building at random.
An office block with a bank on the ground
floor.
As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the BANK
STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him.
Is he so suspicious-looking or
were they expecting him?
Truman rushes to the elevators.
The lights above the doors
show all the elevators on upper floors.
Frantic pressing
of the elevator button gets no response.
Truman heads for the
stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way.
OFFICIAL
You can't--
TRUMAN
(anticipating his response)
--I know.
Truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down
the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district.
Every
building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD
anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED
FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door.
He feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS.
Is he simply drawing
attention to himself by his behavior?
Truman wheels around,
trying to make eye contact with passers-by.
They shy away.
Truman stops still, his head reeling.
A CHARRED APARTMENT BUILDING ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.
DAY.
TRUMAN exits his taxi and takes in the scene.
A partially
burnt building, waterlogged, still faintly smoldering.
Truman
checks the address on his file.
A small, serious-looking BOY
straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk.
TRUMAN
(to the boy)
When was the fire?
BOY
(shrug)
Week ago.
TRUMAN
How come it's still smoking?
BOY
Started up again.
(dismissive)
Kids.
TRUMAN
(referring to his claims report)
Says here it burnt to the ground.
BOY
Wishful thinking maybe?
The boy is wise well beyond his years.
Truman fixes him with a
glare.
TRUMAN
Someone send you to tell me all this?
BOY
(unfazed)
You the one askin' questions.
The boy casually rides away.
CITY PARK.
DAY.
TRUMAN wanders aimlessly through a city park, observing.
We
sense, truly observing for the first time.
A group of YOUTHS play a pick-up game of basketball.
A YOUNG
WOMAN walks a pair of AFGHAN HOUNDS.
An OLD MAN answers the
incessant questions of his GRANDCHILD.
Nothing appears amiss.
TIMES SQUARE.
DAY.
TRUMAN stands amidst a throng of TOURISTS and COMMUTERS marooned
on Times Square.
Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of
vehicles flowing through the intersection.
Truman stares down at the street, contemplating stepping out
into the traffic.
However as his foot is poised, the stream
of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier, now appear to
be giving him a wider berth.
He steps off the sidewalk and.
to an acompaniment of car horns, begins to wander back and forth
without fear through the traffic, confident that each vehicle
will take evasive action.
Safely on the other side of the street, he stands in front of
the window of an electronics store.
He watches a local TV
news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13.
However Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own
face on another TV taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the
store window.
He shudders at his video reflection.
STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.
DAY.
TRUMAN sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move.
A DELIVERY MAN unloads boxes from the back of his truck and
carries them into a Restaurant Supply store.
Further down the
street CONSTRUCTION WORKERS take their time tending to an
electrical repair in an exposed manhole.
A POSTAL WORKER does
his rounds.
An OLD WOMAN struggles with two heavy shopping
bags.
Everybody appears natural, places to go.
Truman turns his attention to a group of ITALIAN-LOOKING MEN
at the only other occupied table at the cafe.
We see extreme
close-ups as Truman scans the men's faces for any sign of
phoniness.
They are talking loudly, making suggestive comments
to the WAITRESS and generally showing off like schoolboys.
Their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine.
Truman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he
has been fidgeting.
STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.
DAY.
TRUMAN
(to the jogger with
the familiar sneakers)
Small world.
JOGGER 1
(attempting to sidestep Truman)
Excuse me.
Truman blocks the man a second time.
TRUMAN
You don't remember?
Two days ago I gave you
my meatball sandwich in the park.
You were
in a wheelchair.
Same sneakers.
An almost subliminal flashback appears in Truman's head
confirming that the JOGGER and the HOMELESS MAN in the
wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same.
TRUMAN
(commenting ironically on his
new-found mobility)
A miracle!
JOGGER 2
(coming to his companion's aid)
Get the hell outta here.
The second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table
causing him to stumble.
WAREHOUSE - MARLON'S WORK.
DAY.
MARLON is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van.
TRUMAN hurries up to him.
TRUMAN
Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.
MARLON
(surprised)
Truman!
Sorry, I'm up against it today.
TRUMAN
I've fallen over something, Marlon.
Something to do with my Dad. I think.
MARLON
(looking at him for the first time)
Are you okay? You look like shit.
TRUMAN
(ignoring the inquiries
about his health)
It's big, Marlon.
You wouldn't believe
who's in on it.
MARLON
(distracted)
In on what?
TRUMAN
There's no point trying to show you, they cover
their tracks too well.
But I've been going
into a lotta strange buildings, seeing a lotta
familiar faces, y'know what I mean?
MARLON
(still engrossed in his own problems)
Something's definitely in the air.
My last
delivery, a kid got crushed to death.
tilting a vending machine.
They won't even
let me take the rest of the day off.
TRUMAN
Do it, anyway.
Marlon scoffs at the suggestion then realizes Truman isn't
joking.
TRUMAN
I'm deadly serious. Marlon.
We can't talk
here.
I'm being followed.
MARLON
(suddenly concerned)
Who?
TRUMAN
I don't know.
They look just like regular
people.
(producing a notebook from
his jacket pocket)
But I've been writing down numbers - license
plates, taxi numbers, ID numbers - the same
ones keep cropping up over and over.
MARLON
Is someone leanin' on you, Tru?
Cos I got
some friends here, they owe me.
We can lean back.
(pointing out a taxi
parked outside the yard)
Is he one of them?
TRUMAN
(anxious)
I don't know.
Could be.
One thing's certain.
The key is spontoneity.
Be unpredictable.
They can't stand that.
That's why we've got
to get outta here.
Can you come with me?
MARLON
(weakening)
Christ, Truman.
You're gonna get both our
asses fired.
Marlon shuts his van and gets in.
Truman enters the
passenger side.
MARLON
Where're we going?
TRUMAN
The beach.
LONG ISLAND BEACH.
DAY.
TRUMAN runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to
scale as a seven-year-old boy.
CLIFFTOP.
DAY.
TRUMAN sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father
had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years
earlier.
However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his
father described - almost identical to its neighbor.
MARLON,
laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop.
MARLON
What're we doing here, Truman?
TRUMAN
This is where it started.
MARLON
Where what started?
TRUMAN
Things.
Things that don't fit.
Loose threads.
False steps.
Slips of the tongue.
MARLON
(irritated)
Make sense, Truman.
You going religious on me?
TRUMAN
(tears of bitterness welling in his eyes)
My father didn't want me to see what was over here.
Whatever it was, it's gone now.
I never shoulda
listened to him that day.
I knew it was wrong.
We see a quick flashback of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN on the cliff-
face twenty-seven years earlier.
TRUMAN
There were a hundred people on the beach that
day.
Everybody knew what was going on except me.
MARLON
I don't want to put you down but why would
anybody go to all this trouble over you?
TRUMAN
Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else.
(a memory triggered)
A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a
copy of Time Magazine.
The week before an ad said,
"Next Week:
Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation".
Marlon shrugs, unimpressed.
TRUMAN
A guy with the same name as me in Time
Magazine.
It ain't a common name so I
looked out for it.
But the day it came
out, every newstand was sold out.
No
library had it.
I even wrote off for a
back-issue.
Never seen a copy to this day.
Marlon remains unconvinced.
TRUMAN
Maybe I'm being set up for something.
You
ever feel like that, Marlon?
Like your
whole life has been building to something?
Marlon looks skeptically at Truman.
He hasn't had that feeling.
MARLON
(becoming testy)
A coincidence.
Haven't you ever heard
of a coincidence?
TRUMAN
I'm a walking coincidence.
I can't count 'em.
No something's happening, Marlon.
I've got
to get to the bottom of it.
MARLON
(shaking his head in exasperation)
Of what?!
Why're you doing this to yourself?
TRUMAN
I'm scared, Marlon.
I'm as scared as hell.
But I've never felt more alive.
It's just
like she said.
MARLON
(suddenly intrigued)
Who?
TRUMAN
It doesn't matter.
She was too beautiful for here.
Now Marlon is really confused.
TRUMAN
Can you lend me some money?
A hundred bucks.
MARLON
All I got on me is the takings from the machines.
Why do you need it?
TRUMAN
I'm going away for a while.
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.
DAY.
CHRISTOF stands with a PRODUCTION MANAGER, mid-thirties, on the
forecourt of the Sydney Opera House, its sail-like roofs soaring
above them.
Framing the background, the coathanger-shaped
Sydney Harbor Bridge.
PROD. MANAGER
(unable to conceal his pride)
Happy?
Christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod.
CHRISTOF
(staring out at the pleasure
craft littering the harbor)
Can we contain him long enough?
PROD. MANAGER
I think so.
Christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the
harbor.
PROD. MANAGER
(anticipating his next question)
He flies at night.
Thick cloud cover to
disorient him.
Hopefully we'll knock him
out with complimentary cocktails, pull the
shades down during the movies.
He'll never know.
Christof gives another grudging nod of approval.
The Production
Manager is beckoned by a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are
putting the finishing touches to a corner of the Opera House.
CHLOE drifts to Christof's side, a Watchman TV in her hand.
CHLOE
(referring to the surrounding scene)
Why go to all the trouble?
Christof glances at the TV screen in her hand, showing TRUMAN
sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of SYLVIA.
CHRISTOF
He believes she has the answer.
CHLOE
Why not just tell him she's dead?
CHRISTOF
It's too late for that.
That won't satisfy
him.
He's going to have to find out for himself.
See it with his own eyes.
Right now he needs
something genuine.
(rueful, all too aware
of the contradiction)
Even if we have to fake it.
MANHATTAN STREET.
DAY.
TRUMAN steps out of the office, suddenly able to breathe
again, pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead.
SUBURBAN STREET IN QUEENS.
DAY.
TRUMAN drives erratically down a quiet suburban street.
On the sidewalk up ahead, he spies a YOUNG MOTHER pushing an
INFANT in a baby carriage.
Truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front
of the mother and child, the car straddling the sidewalk.
He
has the driver's door open almost before the Oldsmobile has come
to a halt.
Truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant
from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot.
The startled infant immediately begins to wail as Truman holds
the crying bundle in both hands above his head.
TRUMAN
(to the Mother, motioning to the sidewalk)
Say my name or I'll smash its head open.
The young mother, frozen with fright, does not reply.
TRUMAN
(vehement)
Say my name!
YOUNG MOTHER
(composing herself,
reaching out for her child)
Please, give him to me...
TRUMAN
(screaming above the baby's cries)
Say my name!
You know my name!
Say it!
YOUNG MOTHER
(bewildered)
I don't know you.
The commotion has attracted the attention of an OLD MAN across
the street, watering his garden.
He drops his hose and hurries
towards the fracas.
Halfway across the street, the old man
stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in
the air.
TRUMAN
(hysterical)
I mean it!
I'm ready to do it!
What's my name?!!
Truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can,
his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent
to the concrete.
We see a view of the scene from the POV of a
streetlight.
The young mother, recognizing Truman's
seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes.
TRUMAN
(entreating the young
woman, tears in his eyes)
This is your last chance!
The anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on
the brink.
The young woman now has tears rolling down her
cheeks.
She is at a loss, powerless.
TRUMAN
(his entire body shaking)
What...is...my...name?!
The young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name.
Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go
through with it.
With everything he has, he gathers himself.
After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the
child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms.
YOUNG MOTHER
(clutching the baby to
her breast, without thinking)
Thank you, Truman.
Truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the
young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat.
He jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the
sidewalk and back onto the street.
The young woman and the old
man stare after Truman's car as it roars away.
TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.
DAY.
TRUMAN, staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden.
doesn't bother to look up as MERYL approaches.
TRUMAN
(referring to a distant
car on the expressway)
See that car way down there?
I bet it's a
Suburu station wagon.
Meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car.
Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by.
Meryl is unimpressed.
Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game.
TRUMAN
I predict the next four cars will be a
white Honda Civic, a blue and white
Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing,
a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender
and a motorcycle.
Meryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for
the house.
Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch.
He
turns to check his prediction.
A convoy of cars approaches.
TRUMAN
There's the Honda...the Dodge...here
comes the dented Beetle...
Meryl's attention wavers.
Truman tightens his grip.
TRUMAN
Look, damn you!
Following the VW is a school bus.
MERYL
(mocking)
Where's the motorcycle?
Truman is momentarily disappointed.
Meryl seizes her chance
and heads for the house.
Truman follows her inside.
TRUMAN
(yelling after her)
Don't you want to know how I did that?
Maybe you already know.
Is that it?
Behind Truman's back, a motorcycle putters by.
SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.
DUSK.
In the twilight sun, SYLVIA'S GUESTS wander up the gravel path,
leading away from the beach house, the younger children carried
in their parents' arms.
Hanging back from the rest of the
group, Sylvia's admirer, wheeling his bicycle, turns back
to the house.
As the MAN is about to lean his bicycle against
the side of the beach house, he looks in a window.
Lit by a blue-glow, SYLVIA sits transfixed by the television
playing in her antique bureau, the screen obscured from our
view.
She is unaware of the man's face at the window.
Recognizing what is playing on the screen, the man regards
Sylvia with a resigned smile.
He mounts the bicycle and rides
back up the path.
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.
DUSK.
Truman's car slides to a stop, blocked by Hazardous Waste
vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant,
the pursuing police car blocking his retreat.
TRUMAN flees the
car, leaving MERYL in the passenger seat.
MERYL
Truman!!
Come back!!
Truman bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKERS in
their protective suits carrying detection instruments.
The
workers give chase in their cumbersome suits, trying to cut off
his path to the power plant.
As he crests a slight rise beyond
the plant, he is finally tackled to the ground.
However,
peering through the long grass, Truman is able to make out the
lights of a cityscape in the distance.
ABANDONED FREEWAY.
NIGHT.
MARLON and TRUMAN, both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end
of their abandoned freeway off-ramp.
TRUMAN
People know who I am, my every move, complete
strangers know my name.
Even when there's
no one around, I feel the eyes on me.
MARLON
(reluctant admission)
I was in the bank today.
The Federal on
Lewis.
A clerk was talking about somebody
named Truman messing with her baby.
Is that
the stranger you're talking about?
Truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation.
TRUMAN
(half to himself, refusing to accept it)
No.
No.
I've never seen her before.
(registering Marlon's skepticism)
I know you already think I'm going out
of my mind but I genuinely believe the
world revolves around me somehow.
Everybody
seems to be in on it.
MARLON
It's a lot of world for one man.
You sure
that's not wishful thinking, you wishing
you'd made something more of yourself?
Christ,
Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had
an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters?
Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
TRUMAN
That's just it.
I think I am somebody.
MARLON
(sympathetizing)
I used to dream all my friends and family
got together in a hotel room, thinking of
ways to fuck me up.
TRUMAN
Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes
I think it's for real.
Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere
in the night.
MARLON
Tru, we've known each other since before
we could get a hard-on.
Truman half-smiles at the ribald remark.
MARLON
The only way we ever made it through
high school was cheating off each other's
test papers.
Jesus, they were identical.
I always liked that, because whatever the
answer was, we was right together and we
was wrong together.
Truman nods fondly at the memory.
MARLON
The only night either of us ever spent
in jail, we spent together and I wet
myself but you never told anyone.
I was best man at your wedding and my
brother was best man at my wedding and
you didn't talk to me for a month over
that and I didn't blame you because you've
been more of a brother to me than he's
ever been.
And I never shoulda let
my Goddam father talk me into that.
Truman is slowly coming around.
Marlon's speech from the heart
soothing away his pain.
MARLON
I know things haven't worked out for
either of us like we used to sit up on
Freemont Street all night and dream they
would.
We all let opportunities pass us
by, none of us asks for the dance as
often as we should.
I know that feeling
when it's like everything's slipping away
and you don't want to believe it so you
look for answers someplace else.
But,
well, the point is, I would gladly step
in front of traffic for you.
Truman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back.
We see
a close up of Marlon's ear.
From inside, unheard by Truman,
CHRISTOF dictates Marlon's heartfelt speech.
TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.
DUSK.
TRUMAN emerges from the garage, wheeling his lawnmower,
deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house.
Staring out of the kitchen window, a tall glass of iced tea in
her hand, MERYL has been anticipating her husband's appearance.
She wears a neckbrace, we sense more as a reminder to Truman
than for any benefit she might derive.
Feeling Meryl's eyes burning into his back, Truman fires up the
mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section
of grass.
We focus on the errant blades of grass as they are
severed by the mower.
The lawn is now uniformly trimmed.
From a mechanical platform above the Expressway, CHRISTOF and
CHLOE watch Truman's final act of defiance laid to rest.
LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.
MORNING.
In the street below, something is different about the rush-hour
traffic.
The PEDESTRIANS are all standing around, no one
walking.
Some are chatting with each other, others primping.
The cars, vans and taxis are also idling.
Camera locations are being checked.
A miniature camera
inserted into the head of a streetlamp, a CAMERA TECHNICIAN
waves his hand in front of an innocent-looking fire hydrant, the
eye of a MDDEL on a bus shelter's cosmetic ad is wiped clean,
the head of a parking meter is replaced, a buttonhole camera is
placed on a BUSINESSMAN's double-breasted jacket by a TECHNICIAN
- we see from the button's POV, a CONTACT LENS CAMERA is
carefully inserted into the eye of Truman's colleague, LAWRENCE,
another TECHNICIAN we observe from the contact's POV.
Finally a surveillance camera on the outside of a bank building
and a TOURIST'S camcorder are positioned.
LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.
MORNING
CHRISTOF (O.C.)
...and, action background...
At the command, the PEDESTRIANS and VEHICLES begin inoving
normally, TRUMAN exits the subway, suspecting nothing.
He
begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour
traffic.
CHRISTOF (O.C.)
...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog...
let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept
together...everybody look like you've got places
to go...
TRUMAN'S HOUSE.
NIGHT.
MARLON's car squeals to a halt outside Truman's house.
Hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest, he
dashes barefoot to the front door.
He tries the doorhandle,
pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously,
shouting Truman's name all the while.
MARLON
Tru!..Tru!..
Frustrated, Marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the
window. He can see the shape of Truman lying on the bed but
his shouts fail to rouse him.
Marlon picks up one of Meryl's
carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window.
MARLON
(shouting a warning)
I'm comin' in, Tru!
Marlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower
of glass over Truman's bed.
Still he doesn't move.
Marlon
reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the
window frame and unlatches the window.
NT. TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.
NIGHT.
MARLON clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands
in an awkward heap on the floor beside TRUMAN's bed.
He pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally
stands at his co-star's bedside.
There is a hissing sound.
Marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover.
Beneath the bedding is a
life-size inflatable female doll.
The doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly
deflating.
Lying beside the doll's chest is Truman's portable
tape recorder.
Marlon picks up the recorder and places it next
to his ear.
The cassette plays the sound of Truman breathing.
VACANT LOT.
DAY.
TRUMAN rolls in the dirt of a construction site, tearing at his
clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud.
He struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a
shopping cart awaits, loaded with soiled plastic bags.
Looking every inch a derelict, Truman begins to wheel his
shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn.
BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
DAY.
TRUMAN wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge.
Over his shoulder, in the far distance, we see a lone car
approaching.
As it nears, we recognize a police car.
Truman takes a look under the bridge, as if participating in
the search.
The car slowly draws alongside, the POLICE OFFICER
looking straight into Truman's blackened face.
POLICE OFFICER
Any sign of him?
TRUMAN
(deliberately gravelling his voice)
Not yet.
The Police Officer takes a second look at Truman.
After what
seems like an eternity, he motions his PARTNER to drive on.
POLICE OFFICER
(to Truman, as the car pulls away)
Take it easy.
LOWER MANHATTAN.
DAY.
We pan down one concrete canyon after another.
The usually
bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted.
Suddenly we see a line of PEOPLE fanned out across a street.
Then another and another.
PEOPLE of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching
down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted
at a crime scene.
The lines include PRINCIPALS and EXTRAS
linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as EXECUTIVES
and SECRETARIES, STORE CLERKS, TELEPHONISTS, MAINTENANCE and
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, WAITERS and WAITRESSES, COOKS, SHOPPERS,
HEALTH WORKERS, SECURITY GUARDS, POSTAL WORKERS, POLICE
OFFICERS, FIRE FIGHTERS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE.
On one occasion we
glimpse Truman's colleagues, LAWRENCE, ERROL and VIVIEN, amongst
the searchers.
A building-to-building, floor-to-floor, office-to-office search
is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the
searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such
as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and
shrubbery.
We focus on one of the waves of searchers.
TRUMAN has linked
arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up.
A swarm of helicopters fills the sky.
ELECTRONICS STORE.
DAY.
A crowd of PASSERS-BY hover around a display of televisions
in the window of an electronics store, awaiting developments.
LOWER MANHATTAN - PIER 13.
DAY.
TRUMAN has broken away from the line of searchers, on the
pretext of taking a leak.
He is standing on the edge of
Pier 13, facing the harbor, his back turned to those beginning
their next sweep.
Suddenly Truman ducks behind one of the green
and white inflatable canopies that enclose the Wall Street
Racquet Club.
We see a close up of Truman's terrified eyes in his blackened
face, staring down at the lapping water.
It triggers a montage
of flashbacks.
As usual the images all appear to play on a
television screen.
TRUMAN on the CLIFF FACE at seven years old, his second grade
teacher SISTER OLIVIA, a close-up of DROWNING STATISTICS at
his insurance company, mesmerized by the water in the FERRY
TERMINAL, seventeen-year old SYLVIA jumping in the fountain, his
WATERBED rocking, and seven-year old Truman sitting on the
UPTURNED BOAT in Long Island Sound crying into the darkness.
PIER 13.
DAY.
TRUMAN comes back to reality.
He steels himself, shuts out the
doubts and dives into the water.
NEW YORK HARBOR.
DAY.
Underwater we see TRUMAN panicking at the shock of the cold
sea, arms and legs flailing.
Suddenly he stops and sinks for a
moment in the weight of his clothes.
Then slowly he rises to
the surface and begins to swim.
Moored in the harbor is the scaled-down replica of Columbus'
flagship, The Santa Maria.
NEW YOUR HARBOR.
DAY.
TRUMAN is at the wheel of the Santa Maria, wind filling her
sails.
Covering the face of the ship's compass is Sylvia's
composite picture.
His is the only craft afloat in New York Harbor.
As the archaic
vessel passes under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridget, the bridge
appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight.
Truman steers
around Norton Point and sets a course for the open sea - the
horizon.
ATLANTIC OCEAN.
DAY.
TRUMAN is out of sight of land, the sea choppier now, rising
and falling beneath his boat.
He nears a large buoy bobbing
clumsily in the strong swell.
An official-looking sign is
attached - "DANGER.
NAVAL EXERCISES.
DO NOT ENTER."
We see an
extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised
miniature camera tracks Truman's progress.
ATLANTIC OCEAN.
DAY.
TRUMAN hears a helicopter overhead.
By now the ocean spray has
washed most of the dirt from his face, only a residue remains.
The rags he wears, including Sylvia's sweater under his open
coat, are soaked.
Her picture clings stubbornly to the compass.
As he steers, he occasionally refers to a "HOW TO SAIL" book
from his coat pocket.
He tacks against the wind, as he watches
the military chopper circle his boat.
CHOPPER PILOT
(over P.A.)
Alter course immediately.
You are
entering a restricted area.
Truman screams defiantly back to the chopper.
TRUMAN
Fuck you!
A STREET SOMEWHERE.
DAY.
Two YOUNG MEN on a street corner watch, transfixed, the image
of TRUMAN steering the Santa Maria on a portable Watchman TV.
YOUNG MAN 1
I knew he wasn't dead.
ATLANTIC OCEAN.
DAY.
A round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows
of Truman's boat, several rounds striking the deck.
TRUMAN
flinches.
In his eyes we see the ghosts return.
With great
effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare
gun from the storage cabinet in the boat's wheel house.
CHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.)
Alter course.
Drop your sails.
Truman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun.
The
distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter, narrowly
missing.
Truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads.
ATLANTIC OCEAN.
DAY.
Before the chopper can take evasive action TRUMAN takes aim a
second time and fires.
The distress flare fishtails into the
sky and to Truman's surprise and delight, finds its mark,
striking the rear rotor blade.
Truman lets out a whoop.
The helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards
the sea.
The CHOPPER PILOTS bail out of the cockpit, splashing
down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves
in a spectacular belly flop, sinking out of view in seconds like
a stone.
Watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in
their inflatable life jackets, thoughts of duty invade Truman's
head.
He shuts out the thoughts and turns his back, steering
away from the drifting pilots.
A look of resolve in his eyes we
have never witnessed before.
ATLANTIC OCEAN.
DAY.
Darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards Truman's
boat at an alarming speed.
High winds buffet the boat.
TRUMAN
fights the wheel.
Hurricane force winds shake the masts and
keel, ripping the sails to shreds.
The picture of Sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the
sea.
His "HOW TO SAIL" book skids off the deck.
Truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes
himself to the wheel to secure himself on board.
TRUMAN
(shouting above the storm)
I'm coming to find you Sylvia!
I'm making
myself deaf!
(screaming up to the sky)
You're going to have to kill me!
Come on!
Monstrous waves continually submerge the deck.
Truman continues
to head into the teeth of the gale.
ATLANTIC OCEAN.
DAY.
TRUMAN appears to be losing his fight against the storm,
each successive breaker taking its toll on his body, sapping
his strength, his bindings the only thing holding him upright,
his head slumps, the wheel goes loose in his grasp, spinning
out of control.
His will, draining away.
As he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his
arm into the handles of the spinning wheel.
He cries out in
pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the
wheel.
He braces for one last wave.
But the wave does not come.
A strange phenomenon is occurring
in the ocean.
A distinct division has appeared in the ocean
swell.
Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of
calmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane.
The wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting.
Truman steers his vessel down this "sea-lane".
After some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the
horizon.
Land?
Islands?
As Truman steers towards the nearest
shape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations.
It is certainly not the moon.
The dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is
exposed above the surface of the sea.
The ocean swell is being
caused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically-driven on
either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed.
In fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in
both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see,
the calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers.
Truman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines.
The exposed
half of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its
length equivalent to several football fields.
The massive arms
perpetually churn.
Truman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly
past the giant rotating drum.
The water beyond the rollers is
dead calm.
Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his
eyes.
But if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to
comprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that
greets him.
His boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow
collision course with the sky.
That infinitely receding horizon
line recedes no more.
The sea really does meet the sky.
The join is only too
apparent.
Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of
colossal dimensions.
The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop.
Truman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the
sky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight.
The bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping
gently into its latex surface.
Truman unties his bindings
and stumbles across the deck to the side rail.
Clinging to the
rail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the
painted cyclorama.
He touches the sky.
He feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it.
Hie eyes well up with tears.
He presses his distraught face
into it.
He screams at the top of his voice.
No words.
A
primal scream.
A pained, animal howl.
BARROOM/ELECTRONICS STORE/HOME.
DUSK.
TRUMAN's cry echos around bars, offices, shops, homes and
streets - wherever a television is to be found.
No VIEWER
speaks.
They are stunned to silence, many teary eyed.
CYCLORAMA.
DUSK.
As the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve
of the cyclorama, TRUMAN's attention is drawn to an outline in
the otherwise flawless backdrop.
He clambers to the prow of the
boat.
There, camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water
line, is a door.
Truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle
and halts the drifting boat.
He stands in front of the door and
closes his eyes in a silent prayer.
He opens the door in the sky and steps through.
VIEWERS.
DUSK.
Spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from VIEWERS in their
various locations - bars, homes and offices.
Strangers hug each
other and dance in celebration.
SOUNDSTAGE.
DUSK.
TRUMAN finds himself on the roof of the soundstage.
Outside.
Really outside for the first time in his life.
He looks frantically around him.
Nowhere to hide.
The
soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the
eye can see, an interminable expanse of roof.
Facing him, a colossal Burbank.
Several other soundstages
almost as gigantic as his own.
The palm trees lining the
streets, dwarfed by the mammoth barns.
The Hollywood Freeway in the distance, carrying its ribbons of
traffic, twenty lanes wide.
Gargantuan office buildings
eclipse any skyscraper Truman has ever known.
Directly below him, a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its
arched entranceway.
Above him, a large yellow moon in the twilight sky.
The real
moon, not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating
for the last thirty-four years.
Truman wheels around, suddenly realizing he is not alone.
A
GROUP has emerged on the rooftop, standing still and silent
in a semi-circle, cutting off any escape.
Along with the STUDIO GUARDS, keeping their distance in the
background, are CHLOE, SIMEON, and the two studio executives,
MOSES and ROMAN.
In front of them, the co-stars in his life -
MARLON, MERYL, sister RAQUEL, mother AUDREY and supposedly dead
father KIRK.
No one moves or speaks as Truman scans the
familiar faces.
Marlon, in particular, cannot look him in the
eye.
Truman's gaze finally falls on the white-haired old man standing
at the head of the group.
CHRISTOF.
He approaches Truman
alone, carrying a white envelope, calling his name the way a
father calls to a son.
CHRISTOF
Truman...
Truman seems to sense the significance Christof has had in his
life, drawn to and repelled by him at the same time.
As they
stand together looking into each other's eyes for the first
time, they seem to be the only two figures on the roof.
For a
moment Truman averts his gaze to the night sky.
TRUMAN
(quietly, half to himself,
half to Christof)
Even the stars I wished on...
As Truman turns his attention back to Christof, he suddenly
lunges at him, catching him off-guard, the envelope slipping
from Christof's hand.
With a strength he never knew he
possessed, Truman forces Christof to the edge of the soundstage
roof, threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world.
Christof clings desperately to Truman to save himself.
The
studio guards dare not move.
CHRISTOF
(staring into the chasm,
remaining eerily calm)
You won't do it, Truman.
I've watched you
your whole life.
TRUMAN
(meeting Christof's gaze)
You never had a camera in my head.
Suddenly the doubts flood into Christof's eyes, fearing he
has misjudged Truman, fearing for his life.
TRUMAN
(incensed)
Something was real!
(a terrifying anguish)
Something had to be real!
It takes all of Truman's will not to hurl the old man into the
abyss.
Christof, petrified, looks to the pristine, white
envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof, glinting in
the moonlight.
Truman follows Christof's gaze.
Contemptuously tossing Christof
aside, he retrieves the envelope.
Christof crawls to safety,
thankful to still be alive, suddenly appearing very small and
insignificant.
But Christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer
exist in Truman's mind.
Truman gazes at his name for a long
moment, handwritten on the envelope in blue ink, then carefully
breaks the seal.
Truman allows the sole item in the envelope to
be slowly revealed.
A photograph.
A close up of SYLVIA's face
including her eyes, mouth and that perfect, ever-elusive nose.
A serenity comes over Truman.
He lifts up his eyes to the
mountains on the far horizon.
As he stands on the very edge of
the soundstage roof without fear, clutching the photograph, we
commence a long, slow pull-back.
Truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall
of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic
picture of his face and proclaiming, "TRUMAN - Total Record of a
Human Life.
34TH GREAT YEAR!"
We continue to pull back until Truman is nothing but a speck on
top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame.
A MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS
The two OLD WOMEN in the living room, the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the
two YOUNG MEN with the Watchman TV, the PATRONS in the bar,
PASSERS-BY outside an electronics store are all captivated by
their television sets.
We focus on the screen of a television.
A small FEMALE BABY
sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of Truman's old
suburban home in Queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his
life.
The infant's doting parents, MARLON and the new actress
VIVIEN, enter frame and begin to fuss over the child.
A border
around the action on the screen announces, "ZOE - Total
Record Of a Human Life".
Suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen.
A BABY stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the
television set in Sylvia's house.
TRUMAN bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the
air, much to the child's delight.
Truman dwells for a moment
on the mirror-image scene on the television before very
deliberately shutting it off.
SYLVIA joins Truman and their daughter.
Together, they exit
the beach house.
We follow them as they make their way onto the
deserted sand and down towards the sea.
