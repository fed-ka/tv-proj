Jack and Maxine exchange a brief kiss and go their
separate ways.

18.
Jack is in the cockpit with his copilot, RON. The
ENGINES are REVVING. Jack is checking gauges. He looks
out the window idly and sees:
The crew of another plane walking across the tarmac.
Paul is one of the crew. Paul sees Jack and begins to
gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise
of the ENGINES.
Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his
package.
JACK
Damn! I forgot to tell them about
the package!
(to Ron)
I gotta make a quick phone call.
I'll be right back.
RON
(knowingly)
Jack, there'll be plenty of girls
where we're going.
JACK
Oh, c'mon, I've really got to
make a phone call! What do you
think I'm going to do, pick up
one of the New Jersey delegates
to the I.B.M. convention?
Jack walks back towards the phone. As he walks we see
that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen.

On the street two men drive by on a motorcycle looking at
the numbers on the apartment buildings. They stop a few
yards from the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's
building.
46.
They are being followed by the beige Chevy that pulls
ahead of them and parks just beyond them. In this car
we recognize Graton sitting with a partner.
The two men, who look like young tough guys (punks), get
off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the
building.
Graton gets out of his car
and heads for the building.
He glances into the lobby,
then goes in. He watches the
elevator floor indicator,
notes the floor it stops on,
then calmly returns to his
car.

59
Punk #1 is attempting to strap the basket onto the
motorcycle with a bungie cord. Punk #2 watches him
coolly.
PUNK #2
We'd be better off taking the
subway.
PUNK #1
You want to ride the subway with
a hundred grand in uncut dope,
go ahead.
PUNK #2
Well we can't ride around
carrying this baby basket.
We'll
get stopped by the cops.
PUNK #1
So go ahead, take the subway and
stop bothering me. I'm going to
hook this onto the back seat.
52.
PUNK #2
It'll never hold, man.
PUNK #1
(desperately going
at the hook and
the basket)
Goddamn hook! Christ, what a
stupid idea hiding the shit with
this kid. It's ridiculous!
Peter comes rushing out of the building.
PETER
(huffing and puffing)
Oh, thank God, you're still here!
There's been a terrible mistake.
That wasn't the package you
were s'posed to take. It was
another one. I have it right
here.
PUNK #1
What do you mean? What other
package?
PETER
I'll take the basket back and
give you the other package, here.
No mistake.
Peter takes the package from his pocket and is about
to grab the basket. Punk #1 pushes him back violently.
PUNK #1
You ain't takin' nothin' back,
man.
PETER
But I'm tellin you it was a
mistake...
PUNK #1
(in a low but very
aggressive tone)
You tryin' to double-cross us or
something? Beat it before I get
pissed, man.
PETER
(panic-stricken,
in an equally
low tone)
But I'm telling you, I've got
your package right here. There's
been a mistake...
53.
PUNK #1
A mistake my ass! Now get outa
here, man, or I'm gonna stick
this right in your gut.
He discreetly reveals a switchblade knife he's carrying.
PUNK #1
(to Punk #2)
Start the bike.
Punk #2 is about to get on the motorcycle.
Peter stops
him.
PETER
But I'm telling you, I've got
the real package in my pocket.
PUNK #2
(to Punk #1)
Watch it, the cops!
Peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. A
patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car
in which Graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the
action.
GRATON
(to his partner)
Terrific! I bet these morons
screw up everything.
One of the COPS gets out of his car and comes over to the
Punks and Peter. Peter is scared stiff.
PUNK #1
(whispering)
If you called the cops on us,
pal, you're a dead man.
COP #1
All right, what's that doing on
the back of the bike?
No one answers.
COP #1
You wouldn't by any chance be
intending to drive with a baby
basket on your motorcycle, would
you?
PUNK #1
Of course not, Officer. We'd
never do something like that.
54.
COP #1
So why did you strap it on in
the first place if you had no
intention of driving with it?
PUNK #2
So it wouldn't fall off.
COP #1
Very funny.
As he speaks, Peter undoes the bungie cord from around
the basket and takes it off the motorcycle.
PETER
No, really, Officer, they weren't
gonna drive off with it -- They
were just watching it for me while
I was doing a quick errand.
(to the Punks)
Thanks, guys.
Punk #1 gives him a dirty look.
COP #1
All right, let's see some
identification, everybody.
The punks exchange a glance.
Suddenly Punk #1 shouts:
PUNK #1
Go!
They take off running in different directions. Cop #1
charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's
still in the car:
COP #1
Watch the guy with the basket!
Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand.
Peter stiffens with fear.
COP #2
Freeze! All right, asshole, let's
see some I.D.
PETER
(urbanely)
Listen, Officer, let's stay calm
now. I haven't the slightest
intention of running. I am not
a criminal. I'm an architect.
COP #2
(calming down
55.
a little)
Your I.D., let's see it.
PETER
I'm terribly sorry, Officer, but
I don't have any identification
on me. I just came down with my
baby to run a quick errand. I
haven't committed any crime.
COP #2
All right, let's go, in the car.
I'm taking you down to the
station.
PETER
Oh, c'mon, that's impossible --
you see I have a baby. I have
to give her a bottle in fifteen
minutes, I can't go anywhere.
I live right in this building --
let me go up to my apartment
and I'll get you my license
immediately... You can even
come with me if you like...
COP #2
All right, lead the way.
They disappear inside the building. Peter is carrying
the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched
on the horrible package hidden in his pocket.
Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed.
Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show-
ing him his badge.
GRATON
(angry)
Inspector Graton, Narcotics. It
just so happens I was tailing
those two guys and now because
of you clowns I lost them,
probably forever. Thanks a lot!
COP #1
How could we know?
GRATON
Forget it. Listen, your partner
went in here with the guy and the
baby. He lives up on the tenth
floor. I can't go in because if
he sees me, my cover is blown. So
could you please try not to lose
this one, okay? He's someone who's
56.
gotta be watched very closely.
I've called for backup and it's on
its way.

Michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with
his back to us, he seems quite busy.
As we CLOSE IN, we discover that he has opened the box of
diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic
has been carefully cut out with scissors.
Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ-
ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves
them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket.
Then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and
flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be-
tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric.
Next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put
back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones.
Michael closes the box again and glues it together so
it looks as if it's never been opened. He throws all
the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of
his brand-new box of diapers. He walks away.
63
66
Hidden within a parked car, three men are keeping a close
watch on the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's build-
ing. The two uniformed cops emerge, get in their car,
and pull away.
67
69
The three men, slumped in their car, are watching the
door of the apartment building.
The three narcotics Agents emerge from the building and
walk away. A short time goes by. Peter and Michael
emerge from the building and quickly walk away. The three
men get out of their car, cross the street and enter the
building.
70
76
Michael is peeking out at the street from the window
above. Peter comes out of the building and turns left,
walking very quickly.
Suddenly, Peter stops, turns
around and retraces his
steps. We can clearly see a
man, who was walking about
six yards behind Peter on the
opposite side of the
street, also turn around and
retrace his steps.
It is Graton.
77
78
Michael is walking on the street carrying two bags of
groceries. Suddenly, a guy walks up to him and elbows
him sharply.
PUNK
Hi! Doin' a little shopping, huh?
How's your place -- not too much
damage, I hope.
MICHAEL
What do you guys want?
PUNK
We want the dope. Tomorrow.
MICHAEL
And we want to give it to you.
But the cops are tailing us
nonstop. Matter of fact, there's
one right behind us now...
PUNK
That's your problem, man. Figure
out a way to shake 'em. Either we
safely get the dope tomorrow, or
you, your friend and the kid'll
get this.
(he quickly stabs
the grocery bags
three times)
We'll call you tonight.
He runs off, disappearing into the darkness. From the
slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk.
Michael is shaking all over. Standing about twenty yards
away, Graton hasn't missed a thing.
79
80A
Graton is speaking into the microphone of his radio.
Next to him sits a cop with phone-tapping equipment.
GRATON
(very excited)
We got 'em, Chief. Five o'clock
75.
tomorrow at the fountain near the
merry-go-round! I'll arrange for
back-up... Hold it, someone's going
into their building...
We see Jack getting out of a taxi with his luggage
and going into the building.
81
87
Michael exits the building. Mary, wrapped in a little
woolen blanket, is in his arms. Michael is also carry-
ing his plastic bag.
Graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike.
GRATON
Okay, he's coming out alone.
I'll follow him. Someone else
stay here to keep an eye on the
other guys.
88
88
Michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with
Mary on her blanket near him.
Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass,
watching them out of the corner of his eye.
Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby.
The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around
a girl. He strolls by casually. He spots Michael and
their eyes meet. The couple sit down on a bench a few
yards away and they begin "making out."
80.
Michael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti-
tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside
him. He puts the clean diaper on her.
Graton, nervous and wary,
watches Michael and the
passersby. Just then, two
punks (Peter and Jack) come
running up to Michael. He
ostensibly takes the brown
package out of his plastic
bag and gives it to them.
The two punks immediately take off with the package.
Graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off
after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes
detectives, who'd been hiding all around.
Michael quickly gets up,
picks Mary up and discreetly
deposits the dope-filled
diaper in a trash can, giving
the punk on the bench an
intent look. Then he goes off
in the direction of the
cops.
The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the
diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and
goes off in the opposite direction.
The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put
up no resistance whatsoever. Michael now joins them.
MICHAEL
What's going on?
GRATON
Inspector Graton, Narcotics. Do
you admit you gave these men this
package?
MICHAEL
Sure. I gave it to them, just a
moment ago.
GRATON
(to one of the cops)
Officer, will you please open this
package in front of these witnesses?
The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate
Easter bunnies. Graton is mortified. He crushes all
the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate
inside them.
MICHAEL
Is it against the law to give a
box of candy to my friends?
Peter and Jack take off their glasses.
GRATON
Oh, it's you guys!
81.
PETER
What's the problem?
GRATON
You guys must think you're pretty
smart, don't ya?
(suddenly freezes)
Holy shit! The diaper!
Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain.
He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where
Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the
trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the
garbage around like a lunatic.
GRATON
The goddam diaper! What a jerk,
what a goddam schmuck I am!
Peter, Michael, Jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives
watch Graton going bananas.
MICHAEL
(to the cops)
I think that guy needs a vacation.
JACK
He should try South America.
PETER
Yeah, I hear it's nice there this
time of year.
89
91
A broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside. Paul
is sitting on a bench. When he sees Jack, he gets up
and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand.
Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and
sends him
with a forceful shove flying into the water.
Paul lands
on his back with a big splash, and comes back
up to the
surface totally dumbfounded. Jack leans over
the water
and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit
drunk.
JACK
That was for your 'little' package,
and consider yourself lucky I
didn't turn you in to the cops!
And get one thing into your thick
skull: I have never touched dope,
83.
and I never will. You and your
shit-dealing, you can go straight
to hell, and you can take the
money you make from it and stick
it up your ass! So long.
Jack turns his back on Paul and staggers off.
PAUL
Hey, come back! -- how'm I gonna
get out of here?
JACK
Crawl.
92
96
A cab slowly pulls up in front of Jack's mother's house.
There is a big red convertible filled with four jovial
senior citizens. Jack comes out of the cab with the basket
and stares at his mother, MARGIE, who's just locking her
door. Next to her, holding her luggage is Steve (a man in
his sixties). They head toward the trunk of the car.
JACK
Hey, Mom!
MARGIE
(hits Steve)
Hey, he finally made it!
MARGIE (CONT'D)
(to Jack)
Do you have any idea what time it
is? It's four. You said two.
JACK
But, Mom, I missed the plane.
MARGIE
Yeah, but now I have to go.
JACK
Where are you going?
MARGIE
On a cruise around the world.
JACK
But why didn't you say so on the phone?
MARGIE
Because you never would've come.
Now let me see her.
(she grabs Mary and
covers her with kisses)
Oh, my little strudle!
STEVE
89.
Hey, Margie.
We're a little late...
MARGIE
Bye-bye, sweetie love... I'll
bring you back presents from all
over the world.
(to Jack, giving
back Mary)
Four o'clock.
She runs into the car and they pull away.
Everyone
waving goodbye.
JACK
(holding Mary)
'Bye!
97
118
A taxi is there. Behind the
wheel the driver sits
waiting. Sylvia is sitting
in the back, on the side
nearest the sidewalk, and on
her lap is Mary, whom
she's gently fondling.
On the sidewalk, beside the
open trunk of the cab,
are all Mary's belongings:
some bags, the playpen, a
stroller, the baby bathtub,
the changing table, etc.
Peter is attempting to pack it all in the trunk.
Michael
is handing the things to him.
PETER
(tense)
Give me the playpen first...
MICHAEL
(equally tense)
Then where are you gonna put the
tub?
PETER
(annoyed)
Just give me the playpen.
CAB DRIVER
Need some help?
PETER
No, no thanks... I'd rather do it
myself...
Jack is standing beside the back door of the cab, leaning
over toward Sylvia, who is holding Mary. He is trying
unsuccessfully to sound angry.
JACK
You really screwed us over but
good -- you know that...
SYLVIA
I know, I'm sorry.
JACK
Really. Our lives have been out
of control for the past six
months.
121.
SYLVIA
Yeah, I bet... Actually, that was
kind of the point... But I'm the
one who really got screwed...
She starts to cry again.
JACK
Don't cry, c'mon... you're taking
her back now, it's great...
SYLVIA
(wiping her eyes)
Yeah, it's great...
JACK
D'you have enough money?
Can you
manage all right?
SYLVIA
Yeah, sure... I'm not loaded, but
it's okay -- I'm working, I've
got modeling jobs lined up...
JACK
Do you have a boyfriend?
SYLVIA
No. That's the last thing I need.
I've got my work. And now I've
got her.
She rubs noses with Mary.
Peter and Michael approach.
PETER
That's it, we fit it all in...
JACK
Okay, then... well, 'bye...
The three men are lined up on the sidewalk. Mary stares
at them, looking a little lost. They wave their hands
and:
PETER, MICHAEL AND JACK
'Bye, Mary!
MARY LAUGHS and waves.
SYLVIA
(with a big, sad
smile)
Okay, well, thanks again -- 'Bye!
PETER, MICHAEL AND JACK
122.
'Bye!
The CAR STARTS up, pulls away, and disappears FROM VIEW.
JACK
(playfully)
Well, that's that!
MICHAEL
Yeah...
PETER
Right... That's that.
They head back to their apartment building.
PETER
Oh shit -- I forgot to explain
about the cereal!
JACK
She'll figure it out by herself...
MICHAEL
Yeah, she'll manage...
JACK
Now it's back to the good life
for us!
MICHAEL
Sleeping late! Different women
every night! I can't wait!
JACK
Forget about the New York-Washington
shuttle! I'm off to Caracas!
PETER
And I'm gonna be able to get back
to work, so Carl better watch it
-- I'm gonna slaughter that
son-of-a-bitch! First with this
goddam competition... and then
with Natalie.
MICHAEL
And I've got six months' worth
of sex to catch up on with Cathy,
Nora, Frances, Susan, Barbra...
They have entered the elevator. The doors close. They
come out of the elevator, in front of their apartment.
MICHAEL
...Christie, Paula, Sheila, Lisa,
Kimberly, Rhonda, Rebecca, Louisa...
123.
But not necessarily in that order!
They enter the apartment and Peter walks on something
that lets out a TERRIBLE SQUEAK.
PETER
Oh, she forgot her squeaky
giraffe.
He picks it up and throws it onto an armchair.
119
119
Jack takes a running jump and does a cannonball into
the pool of a luxury hotel somewhere in the world. He
splashes two girls who find it very funny...
120
120
Peter, with a bouquet of flowers, runs like mad down a
street.
121
123
Jack is running on the tarmac; he quickly mounts the
stairs to his plane as he waves a heartrending goodbye
to a young woman he's left behind in the airport. At
the top step, he bumps into another young woman: it's
124.
love at first sight.
124
133
Graton and Jack are sitting on a bench beside the East
River. Jack, still pregnant, has brought along his
bottle of scotch, and he takes a swig from it occasion-
ally. Graton has brought along his rabbit.
GRATON
There's something I have to know...
JACK
Wouldn't you like to be pregnant?
GRATON
What? Oh sure... maybe... no...
I dunno... Look, there's been
something bothering me for a long
time.
JACK
You see, if I was God, and I could
create the world all over again,
here's what I would do: I would
create Adam from Eve's rib, not
the other way around.
GRATON
(having trouble
following)
Really?
GRATON (CONT'D)
That's an interesting idea...
Actually, I just wanted to ask
you...
JACK
At least that way things would
have been clearer to begin with,
y'see. They wouldn't have made
us believe that somebody could
come out of our rib, y'know?
'Cause nothing ever comes out
of our rib, y'know? Ever. Only
out of our prick, and even then
... Everything still has to be
done after that.
GRATON
(very unsure)
That's for sure...
JACK
What we men know how to make is
planes, buildings, cars, and all
that stuff... It's useful, mind
130.
you...
GRATON
It's driving me crazy! This thing
keeps going around and around in
my head...
JACK
And you know what, it's not even
like they wanted us to believe
it -- it might have been us who
wanted to believe it... But let's
face it, nobody comes out of our
rib...
GRATON
(dives right in)
Was the dope in the diaper, yes
or no?
JACK
Still, that's hard to take, goddam
it!
GRATON
Was it in the diaper, or not?
JACK
The dope?
It was in the diaper,
why?
GRATON
(getting up)
Oh, thanks a lot. I feel so much
better now. Here, this is a rabbit
for your baby.
(shakes both Jack's
hands)
Thanks again, 'bye, I'm so happy.
Graton goes off, floating on cloud nine.
JACK
(reaching out
toward him
with the rabbit)
But wait -- the baby's gone...
