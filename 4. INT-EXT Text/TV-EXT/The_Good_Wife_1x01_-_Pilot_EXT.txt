      ...a backstage green room where two political ops sweep up: 

                                  POLITICAL OPS
                    We need to do the Tribune first--
                    Channel Four wants a sit down.  We--

      But Alicia still eyes the lint on David s sleeve.  David looks 
      toward her, sees how strangely removed she is.  

                                  DAVID FOLLICK
                    Are you alright?

      Alicia looks up at him, and... 

      ...SLAP!  She slaps him so hard David falls to one knee, 
      looks up at her stunned.  But Alicia, very controlled, very 
      proper, straightens her blouse, reaches for her purse, calmly 
      and coolly exits into... BLACK.  And a title appears... 

                                   Six months later.  


                                  ALICIA
                    The weapon?

      Alicia and Kalinda cross toward the criminal courthouse: 

                                    KALINDA
                    Never recovered.  The cops 
                    theorized she threw it into Lake 
                    Michigan.  They dragged the lake, 
                    never found it.  Gunpowder residue 
                    was inconclusive.


      An electronic monitor.  It blinks away on Jennifer s ankle as   
      Kalinda and Alicia take notes, listening:

                                  JENNIFER COMBS
                    We had a nice time.  Michael talked 
                    about missing his daughter, and about 
                    the life we had together.  He wanted 
                    to drive along the lake, but we got a 
                    flat.  He was getting out to fix it 
                    when I saw...  a red pick-up truck.  
                          (pained)
                    Do we need to do this again? 

                                    KALINDA
                    Mrs. Combs, we re looking for 
                      inconsistencies in your testimony.  
                    So yes.

      Jennifer swallows.  Alicia eyes her, sees how hard this is.  

                                  JENNIFER COMBS (O.S.)
                    The driver came up to Michael s 
                    window.  He was wearing a ski mask, 
                    and I... I didn t see the gun until 
                    Michael grabbed it.  There was this 
                    shot, and I saw... Michael s face...  
                          (pauses, unbearable)

                                  ALICIA
                    Do you want to pause for a minute?

      Kalinda shoots an irritated look toward Alicia.

                                  JENNIFER COMBS
                    No.  Just if there were some water.


      A worried Alicia talks with Kalinda on her cell:                                                                                     23.


                                  ALICIA
                    I m checking her out now.   She s 
                    the only reason Jennifer isn t 
                    facing 30 to life.  

                                    KALINDA (O.S.)
                    Get her details: age, employment, 
                    college level.  We can gear jury 
                    selection to her type.

      Alicia nods and...


      A prison.  Trees.  Grass.  More Club Fed than Folsom.  


      Alicia.  A new side to her.  Passion.  Arguing with Kalinda: 

                                  ALICIA
                    Look, the cops focused on Jennifer 
                    even before they did a chemical 
                    analysis of the trace evidence; so 
                    what if they only did an analysis 
                    of what fit their theory? 

      Kalinda snaps photos of the crime scene: a windswept 
      industrial road beside Lake Michigan. 

                                    KALINDA
                    And what if they didn t?  What if-- 
                          (Alicia holds up a paper)
                    Okay, what s that?

                                  ALICIA
                    Page one of the crime lab summary.  
                    I was digging through the 
                      discovery.  Look at the top corner.

      Kalinda leans in, sees a Xeroxed slanted line.  

                                    KALINDA
                    Looks like a staple.

                                  ALICIA
                    It is a staple.  

                                    KALINDA
                    And that s odd because?

                                  ALICIA
                    There was no page two.  
                          (Kalinda looks at her)
                    Why did they need a staple if there 
                    was no page two?

                                    KALINDA
                          (takes a second)
                    You think they kept page two out of 
                    the discovery because there was 
                    something incriminating? 

                                  ALICIA
                    I think either they did, or it 
                    would be helpful in court to imply 
                    they did.                                                                                     31.


      Kalinda eyes Alicia.  A new Alicia.  Liking this version.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Look, Jennifer s innocent, but if 
                    we can get her off on a process 
                    question, that s still justice.    

                                    KALINDA
                    So just so I m clear: we re a day 
                    away from trial and you re thinking 
                    of dropping the old strategy? 

                                  ALICIA
                    Dawna barely convinced a cat lady 
                    to acquit.  So, yes.  

                                    KALINDA
                          (takes the lab report)
                    Okay.  I ll check into it.

      Alicia nods: good.  They turn to the Walmart parking lot.

                                    KALINDA (CONT D)
                    So a pick-up truck is crossing a well-
                    lit, empty parking lot and for some 
                    reason Jennifer s disorientated, and 
                    thinks it s coming not from that 
                      direction, but that direction. 

      They compare the views.  Nothing alike.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t believe it.

                                    KALINDA
                    Me neither.  So how is a truck 
                    missed by that surveillance camera?  

      A camera on the side of the Walmart.  Alicia shrugs:

                                  ALICIA
                    Mismarked surveillance tape?

      Kalinda looks at her, considers it.  Interesting.  She 
      crosses to her car, takes off her jacket, drops it inside, 
      unbuttons the two top buttons of her blouse.  Preparing.  

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

                                    KALINDA
                    Working.  These are better than 
                      subpoenas.                                                                                    32.


      Alicia smiles.


      A downtown apartment building.  Middle class nice.  Doorman.  
      Surrounded by a sea of traffic, sirens.  On the 7th floor...


      A sunny day.  Leaves falling from the trees.  And...


      Morning.  Bright and beautiful.
