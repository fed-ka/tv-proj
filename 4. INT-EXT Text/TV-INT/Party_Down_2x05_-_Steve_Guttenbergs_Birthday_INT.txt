      shirts unbuttoned. Roman huddles with KENT, a blobby 20-*
      something geek. Kyle checks the house with COLETTE, a wispy-
      hot actress. Lydia and MRS. GOMEZ -- 40 s, Latina -- sip wine *

                    I can t believe I m really talking 
                    to you. My daughter s an actress, 
                    so I m going to pester you for 
                    secrets on making it as an actor.

                    No secret. It s like the joke. Guy 
                    gets into a cab and says,  you know 
                    how to get to Carnegie Hall?  and 
                    the driver says  Practice! 

      Lydia laughs. Mrs. Gomez looks to Lydia blankly. Explaining--

      AT THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER, Casey stands at a shelf filled 
      with DVD s. Henry approaches.

                    These are things you need to know. 
                    Success is a lifestyle you prepare 
                    for. In the tabloids every day, 
                    some schmuck hits it big, goes to 
                    pieces  cause they aren t ready for 
                    success. You re going to make *
                    millions. What re you going to do?*

      A nice office space.  At the TV, Casey pops the DVD into the 
      player, grabs the remote and starts fast forwarding.


      A room devoted to his art collection. Steve walks Henry, 
      Lydia and Mrs. Gomez through the room, offering insights.

                    Started collecting art twenty years

                    A man in a field--

                    But look at the man. Exhausted from 
                    work. An interesting dichotomy.

      Henry has gotten ahead. Stares at something, kinda baffled.

                    It s like a picture of a feeling.

      They pause at a large photorealistic canvas, which depicts a 
      nude, grimacing body builder, erect, penis thrust into the 
      back of a porcupine. The quills have drawn blood. A beat.

      Casey sits watching the DVD on a TV set. Rapt. Impressed.  We 
      can hear Henry s voice, acting the scene.

      Steve pops his head in, and Ron moves to block his view of

      Ron grabs a tray of appetizers and the St. Emilion. Travis

                    I had to know if the coordinates 
                    worked. That you were safe--

                                  HENRY
                    If they work, you ve saved us all.

                    Her face s ruined, she s of no use--

      Henry angrily slaps Kyle.

                                  HENRY
                    Is that all she is to you? A face?

                                  KYLE
                          (breaking character)

                                  HENRY
                    Sorry, it s acting--

                                  KYLE
                    Oh, cool. Okay, I m back in--

                    Sir, chance of survival is point--

                                  HENRY
                    She risked all. So can we. Engage--*

      A MAN IN SHIRT AND TIE -- CARLOS -- eases into the room.

                                  CARLOS
                    Sorry, door was open. Is Travis--?

      Steve waves him to the kitchen. Carlos hustles through--

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    So Borp-7 fires the tachyon cannon, 
                    there s a space warp thing, and...

                                    COLETTE
                    We re clear.

                                  CASEY
                    Thank you for saving my people.

      She  dies.   Henry picks her up in his arms.

                                  HENRY
                    No! No, no, no--

                                    COLETTE
                    Sir, her life readings--

                                  HENRY
                    What do you know about life?

      Henry kisses Casey s  lifeless  body.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              Party Down - Ep.205 - BLUE DRAFT- 10/12/09        23.

                    I m learning, sir.

      Henry drops Casey, puts his head in his hands--

                                  HENRY
                    We saved the galaxy--

      --he looks up, tears run down his face. A long beat--

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                      And...scene!


      Everyone clusters around Kent and Roman. Steve is thrilled.

                                  LYDIA*
                    It was a thrill ride! And it was so *
                    sad when the slave girl dies--*

                                  MRS. GOMEZ*
                    He loved her.*

                                  STEVE GUTTENBERG
                    Humanity. Heart. Drama. God, great, 
                    this is what I love about theater! *
                    See? You put yourself out there, 
                    braved the response, and voila!

      Roman stews, while Kent smiles--

                                    COLETTE
                    I liked the line,  I m learning.  
                    It s like she s learning to learn--

                                  KYLE
                    Yeah, it made me think of Ayn Rand--

                                  KENT
                    You seen his art collection? He s 
                    got a Spankler--

                                  KYLE
                          (laughing)
                    Oh, shit, where the dude s fucking 
                      a porcupine--

                                  KENT
                    It s intense, isn t it?*

      They head off. Kyle watches her go, baffled. Turns to Roman.

                                  KYLE
                    It s a dude fucking a porcupine.


      Ron enters to see Carlos with Travis, who is tipsy--*

                                  TRAVIS
                    This St. Emilion with this St. 
                    Andre and the almonds, it s just--

                                    CARLOS*
                    Man, it s a bad environment. *
                    What re you doing here--?*

                                  RON*
                    He s my sponsor, he s helping me. *
                    Who are you?*

                                    CARLOS*
                    Carlos. I m AA, too, I m here to *
                    help Travis.*

                                  RON*
                    Oh. Didn t you fix the pump?*

                                  TRAVIS
                    I got the shrimp out, but I m too 
                    wasted to reattach the intake--

                                  RON*
                    So they sent you to attach it--?*

                                    CARLOS*
                    You called your sponsor here to fix *

                    I thought I did.*

      Carlos just stares at Ron. WTF?*            Party Down - Ep.205 - BLUE DRAFT- 10/12/09        24A.




      Travis checks the label on a bottle, while Carlos puts the 
      pump on the tank. Ron watches. Carlos grabs the bottle.

                                  RON
                    So, in the future, if I have issues *
                    like this, who should I call?*

      Carlos just glares at Ron. ON THE SOFA, Kyle and Roman slump.

                                  KYLE
                    I liked the first draft. Krond and 
                    DuKlark, that s the story. They re, *
                    like, Jungian shadow figures--

                                  ROMAN
                    I know. That s why you should never 
                    show your stuff. People are stupid.

      CASEY, looking rattled, stomps through the room. She pauses 
      at the sideboard, scribbles on Henry s clipboard--

                                  KYLE
                    You leaving?

      -- she just nods, terse, and she exits.
