      THWACK!  A boxing glove CRACKS into a Heavyweight s jaw.  The 
      mouthpiece goes FLYING.  The fighter staggers. It is a lop-
      sided match. Fans ROAR...

      IN THE SEATS

        Well-dressed clientele thirsty for the blood.  MAYOR BENNETT
      (45, a nervous mien) sits ringside, paying little attention 
      to the fight, focused instead on the empty seat to his left, 
      scanning the crowd for the occupant. He turns to his right, 
      facing D.A. REYNOLDS (42) and shouts over the crowd...

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      Something s wrong.  Clyde would 
                    never miss this.  Where the hell is 
                    he? 

      A BLONDE passes in front of them on her way to her seat. 
      Reynolds  eyes TWINKLE at the Blonde. She SMILESback, sexy.                                                                                      7.


                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                            (winking)
                      Sheriff s in Reno with his 
                      paramour, Mr. Mayor.  That s French 
                    for girlfriend.  You need one.  

                                    MAYOR BENNET
                      I need a Sheriff. That s what I 
                    need. I got ten years comping high 
                      rollers and pension managers, ten 
                    years fighting blue laws, Indians, 
                      permits for this goddamn arena. All 
                      that s left is presenting the new 
                    plan for the Strip Monday night.  
                    Is it too much to expect that my 
                      Sheriff doesn t go AWOL again?! 

      The bell rings and Reynolds finally looks at Bennett.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    Ted. I understand you ve got a lot 
                    on the line.  We all do.

      He stops short -- as a woman approaches, KATHERINE 
        O CONNELL(29). Assistant District Attorney. Pretty, whip 
      smart. A woman playing a man s game.  Dressed more Eastern 
      than Western, partly because she can afford to, partly to 
      hide her ranching roots.

                                    KATHERINE
                    Mr. Mayor, District Attorney.  
                    Sorry to interrupt --

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                      -- We re off the clock, Katherine.

                                    KATHERINE
                      There s something you need to see.  
                    They found a girl, murdered, out on 
                    the N.T.S. 

      This gets their attention.  

                                    KATHERINE (CONT D)
                    The Governor s niece.

      Mayor Bennett meets eyes with Reynolds. Dread.


      Rows of SLOT MACHINES are stacked along the sides.  Metal 
      working tables are empty -- the workers have been cleared 
      out.  Tuna and Savino round a corner...

      A DEALER (20s), sits on the floor, tied around the chest with 
      a metal chain to a slot machine.   The man bleeds from the 
      mouth and lip. Cota and Borelli stand off to the side. 

                                    COTA
                    Says he doesn t know nothing.

                                    TUNA
                          (to dealer, reasonable)
                    All we want to know is where we can 
                    find that miserable Sheriff.  
                      Thinks he can take our money and 
                    then turn on us. 

                                    DEALER
                      I don t know where he is. Honest. 

                                    TUNA
                            (okay...)
                    You deal cards. Don t make us do 
                    this. 

      Cota steps up with a pair of METAL SHEARS.  The Dealer looks 
      up in terror. Cota puts the shears  blades around his thumb --

                                    DEALER
                      Noooo!

                                    TUNA
                    He s not worth it.  Where is he?

                                    DEALER
                    -- His sister s house!  In 
                      Henderson.  On Edna Street.  

                                    TUNA
                    You sure?

                                    DEALER
                            (panicked)
                    I saw him this morning.  

                                    TUNA
                    See, that was easy.  

      Cota SNAPS the chain.  It falls to the floor.  Cota and 
      Borelli help the man to his feet.                                                                                      10.


      Savino reaches inside his jacket, pulls out a gun and FIRES 
      at the man s forehead.    He drops to the floor, dead.

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                    Go dig a hole.

                                    BORELLI
                    We already did.

      As they leave, HOLD on the slot machine behind the fallen 
      man, as blood trickles down a jackpot.


      Lamb sits in the back, quiet.  Cuffed.  His face scratched.  
      A Deputy drives.                                                                                    12.


      A call comes on the Deputy s radio.  He reaches over, 
      ANSWERS.  Lamb can t hear what s being said.  After a moment, 
      the Deputy cradles the mic.  His expression changed -- now 
      tight, disturbed.  He flips on his ROOF LIGHTS and pulls a U-
      turn.  

      Off Lamb, not sure where they re heading --


      The Mayor reads the morning paper while Reynolds stands over 
      his desk, pressing his point.  Katherine stands a safe 
      distance away, observing the men go at it.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    We don t tie this up fast, the 
                      Governor s gonna aim that shiny new 
                      gaming Commission at us like a 
                      goddamn bazooka.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT 
                      That s why I want Lamb to handle 
                    it.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    Why?  The Deputies can report to 
                    me.  I m a bit more qualified than 
                      a cattle rancher.

      The Mayor looks up at Reynolds a beat, hangs on his last 
      words.  He stands and walks over to his window: a view of the 
      casinos, the lights sparkling even though it s 8 in the 
      morning.  As he looks out...

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Back in Korea, Lamb and I were 
                      assigned to a unit based in 
                      Ryongkang, a little village ten 
                      clicks from the DMZ.  We were out 
                    on maneuvers and found a girl in 
                    the woods with her throat slit.  
                    Then more dead girls turn up, seven 
                    in all.  Lamb took over the 
                        investigation.  Didn t sleep for a 
                    week.  The locals had fingered a 
                      village kid for the killings and 
                    they were about to put a bullet in 
                    his head when Lamb finds an order 
                    of morphine coming into the 
                        Quartermaster.  We hadn t seen any 
                      action for a few weeks, so he 
                      wonders why we re running low.  He 
                    looks at the victims  bodies and 
                    finds marks in their necks. 
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    15.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT(CONT'D)
                    Lamb figured out our Medic was 
                      knocking the girls cold with the 
                    drug, raping them and slicing them 
                    up. 
                          (turns to Reynolds)
                    You find me a man like that, I ll 
                    send Lamb back to his ranch.  But 
                      you re not that man.  

      It sits there.  Reynolds can t say anything.  The Mayor 
      punches his INTERCOM.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                    Send them in.

      He looks up at Reynolds.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                      That s French for we re done.

      A beat, then the door OPENS.  The Secretary ushers in four 
      powerful looking men.  The Old Guard, the original Casino 
      elite.  Their leader: BENNY CASH (53, slick and tough.)  The 
      Mayor steps out to greet them --

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                      Gentlemen.  Coffee?  Whisky?

      The Mayor steps forward and shakes hands.  Off Reynolds, 
      watching the cabal, on the outside looking in --  


      Reynolds and Katherine exit the office, out into the hallway. 
      As they move down the hall --

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    He wants to sink his career, fine.  
                    But I m not going down with him.  
                    What do you know about Lamb?

                                    KATHERINE
                      I grew up with him and his 
                      brothers. His ranch is next to 
                    ours.  They ve been out there since 
                    the Indian wars.  

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    He s got two brothers, what else?  
                    Wife, kids?

                                    KATHERINE
                    No.  His wife passed away when he 
                    was in Korea.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    16.

                                    KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    From what I ve heard, he s stayed 
                    on his ranch since he came home.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    So what s he in it for?  A piece of 
                      a casino?  Property rights on the 
                      Strip? 

                                    KATHERINE
                            (shrugs)
                    If I had to guess, I think he just 
                    wants to run his ranch.

      Reynolds seems amused.  The notions seems... quaint.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                          (we ll see)
                    Keep an eye on him.  I want to know 
                    what he s up to before I read about 
                    it in the papers.

      Reynolds walks off.  Leaving Katherine watching him...


      Inside the kitchen, Lamb pulls two shotguns off a rack.  
      Frank trails behind...

                                    FRANK
                    And who s supposed to round up the 
                      twelve hundred head going to market 
                    next week --

                                    LAMB
                      Francisco and the boys can handle 
                    it.  

                                    FRANK
                      -- there s a half ton of feed due 
                    to be dropped off this afternoon --

      Lamb stops him.  He pockets a box of shotgun shells.  

                                    LAMB
                      I already told you.  You re coming 
                    with me.  You re good with numbers 
                    and you re better with people than 
                    I am.                                                                                    17.


                                    FRANK
                    The bar is fairly low. 
                          (then)
                    What do I know about catching 
                      criminals?

                                    LAMB
                    Ask a few questions, listen to what 
                      people say.  What they don t is 
                    just as important.  

                                    FRANK 
                      Should I be writing this down?

      Lamb ignores him, pushes out the screen door to --


      LON SIMMONS, Pauite Indian, 25, linebacker big, sits in the 
      cab.  His supervisor, ACKERS, 38 and angry, steers the truck 
      down an alley.  A horse race plays on the radio.  As Ackers 
      grinds the truck to a stop...

                                    ACKERS
                        Probationarywage is a buck twenty 
                    five and hour.  Bumps up a dime 
                    after a month.  

      He jumps out.  Lon follows...


      Lamb drives, with Frank between him and Lon, down a wide 
      street with manicured lawns and sprawling ranch houses set on 
      a golf course.  As Lamb slows in front of the circular 
        driveway... 

      ... Lamb sees a BUSINESS MAN picking up the mail and walking 
      inside...

                                    LAMB
                    That could be a problem.

      Lamb GUNS the truck past the driveway, makes a hard right --


      The refrigerator is open. Big Tuna eats a sandwich, reads the 
      paper.  Mayo, mustard and cold cuts lie on a cutting board.  
      A radio plays a tinny version of Elvis s  Big Hunk of Love.  

      Savino comes in from the back.  The screen door CLATTERS
      shut.

                                    SAVINO
                      Sister was right.  Sheriff must ve 
                    just left.  Oil stains in the 
                      garage are fresh.

                                    TUNA
                    Our friend at the Gambling 
                      Commission says he hasn t ratted 
                    yet.  He s out there somewhere.   
                    He could make it hard on us if he 
                      talks.                                                                                     20.


      Savino washes his hands in the basin.  Shakes them dry.  

                                    SAVINO
                    He won t.

      Tuna glances over -- sees Savino s calm, measured manner.   A 
      dangerous confidence.

                                    TUNA
                    You hungry?

                                    SAVINO
                    Nah, I m fine.

      Savino picks up the paper.  A HEADLINE details the Anna Meade 
      murder, with a PHOTO of her above the fold.  Shows Tuna.

                                    SAVINO (CONT D)
                    I see she worked for us.  Anything 
                      I need to know?  

                                    TUNA
                    No problem.  Just keep an eye on 
                    the cops.  You never know what they 
                    may be looking for.

      Tuna casually reaches into the refrigerator for a beer.

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                      Imported!  You want one?  

                                    SAVINO
                    I m okay.

      Tuna grabs two beers anyway.

                                    TUNA
                    Let s go.

      They walk out of the kitchen.  As they pass through the front 
      room and out the door, TILT DOWN to... 

      ... a DEAD WOMAN -- the Sheriff s sister -- half on the 
      couch, half-off on the floor.  HOLD ON her as we HEAR the car 
      START and drive away.  Off her face, frozen in horror --


      A suite of a top of the Sahara.  A view of the Strip.  

      Lamb and Frank stand across DORIS MEADE, Anna s mother, 
      dressed in black, seated on the couch.  Emotionally removed: 
      a moneyed bearing.  She takes in the news, brittle.                                                                                    21.


                                    DORIS 
                    ... at a casino?

                                    LAMB
                    Yes.  She s been there about six 
                      months.  

                                    DORIS
                    And what was she doing there?

                                    LAMB
                    She worked in the credit 
                      department.

                                    DORIS
                      I see.

        Lamb observes Doris process.  This is all news to her.

                                    FRANK
                    You mind me asking why you don t 
                    know this? 

                                    DORIS
                    My daughter and I hadn t spoken for 
                      a year.  I didn t know where she 
                    was living.  I assumed it was with 
                    that young man.

      She leaves it there, a forced politeness.

                                    LAMB
                    Who?

                                    DORIS
                    A day laborer on our ranch.  His 
                    name was Cale Green.  Anna had 
                      become smitten with him -- he was 
                    quite handy with the horses.  She 
                    knew how I felt, but continued to 
                    see him anyway.  When she was away 
                    at school, I ceased his employment.  
                    Anna found out, and she ran off to 
                    be with him.  That was the last we 
                      spoke. 
                          (then)
                    My daughter was very headstrong.  
                    She insisted she do things her own 
                    way.  Even if it was beneath her.  

      She looks up at Lamb, cold.  

                                    DORIS (CONT D)
                    I m sure you understand.                                                                                    22.


      She locks eyes with Lamb and leaves it there.   A grim 
      certainty to her prediction.  Lamb registers it.

      A tall, broad-shouldered MANin a dark overcoat walks in, 
      trailed by a coterie of officials.  GOVERNOR ALLEN KERN.  Two-
      term iron-fisted politician from Northern Nevada.  

                                    GOVERNOR KERN
                      Doris.

      He walks to his sister.  She steps forward and meets his open 
      arms.  Her head collapses into his chest.  Off Lamb, 
        registering the loss --


      CALE GREEN (26, raw-boned) sits on a bail of hay.  Bleary-
      eyed and distraught.  Frank and Lamb across from him. 

                                    LAMB
                    We re not pointing at anybody.  
                    Just tell us what you were doing 
                      Friday night.

                                    CALE
                      Drinking.  In my trailer.
                          (then, knows it s coming)
                      Alone.                                                                                     25.


                                    FRANK
                    Bad answer.

                                    CALE
                    It s the truth.

                                    LAMB
                    Find a better one.  Your girl s 
                    dead.  

      Cale feels their eyes on him.  A beat.

                                    CALE
                    I was due to ride saddle bronc that 
                      night, then Anna calls, says she  
                    had to work late again.  I let my 
                      thoughts get away from me, started 
                      thinking maybe she was seeing some 
                    other guy.  

                                    LAMB
                    Why?

                                    CALE
                      I barely saw her last couple weeks -
                      - she s working days, I m here 
                      nights -- we d both been putting in 
                    the hours so we could save up and 
                    buy a place.  But lately she closed 
                    down on me, wasn t talking much.  
                    Kept staying late at work. 

                                    FRANK
                    Had to make you pretty angry, 
                      thinking she d been cheating on 
                    you. 

      Cale reacts -- knows where he s going.   

                                    CALE
                    I d never lay a finger on her.  She 
                    gave up everything to be with me.  
                      Money, college, her own family.  
                    Never could make sense why she did 
                    it all for me.  But she did.
                          (beat, lost)
                    Maybe she finally listened to her 
                      mother.  Found herself some suit to 
                      marry. 

      Lamb looks skeptical.

                                    LAMB
                    She doesn t seem the type.                                                                                    26.


                                    CALE
                      I don t know what to think. 

      Lamb looks at him a long beat.

                                    LAMB
                    What did you do after the rodeo?

                                    CALE
                    Went to the trailer, drank anything 
                    that was wet, then figured I d go 
                    track down this guy and tune him 
                    up.  Next thing I know, I m waking 
                    up in my truck. That s all I 
                      remember.

      Lamb nods to Frank.  

                                    LAMB
                    Next time we come back, you better 
                      remember more.  

      Lamb and Frank exit.  Off Cale, broken -- 


      COWBOY BOOTS leave dusty footprints on the plush carpet.  
      Followed by a pair a jet black ALLIGATOR LOAFERS. 

      Savino leads Lamb and Frank into the CASINO.  

                                    SAVINO
                    You said you were Sheriff s 
                      Deputies?  

                                    LAMB
                    For now.  We re helping out the 
                      Mayor.

                                    SAVINO
                    It s just, I m from Chicago.  Our 
                    cops got beer bellies and holes in 
                    their shoes.

      Savino stops, eyes Lamb.  Curious.

                                    SAVINO (CONT D)
                      I think I saw you at the airport 
                      yesterday.   You were very 
                      effective.

                                    LAMB
                    It was a misunderstanding.

                                    SAVINO
                    I m sure it was.  
                          (then)
                    Let me introduce you to Bob Perrin. 
                    Our credit manager. He supervised 
                    Miss Meade in the credit 
                      department.  Mr. Perrin?

      A few feet away, a man breaks away from a colleague.  BOB 
      PERRIN.  Credit Manager. 

                                    SAVINO (CONT D)
                    He ll answer any questions you 
                    have.
                          (pause)
                    Oh, by the way, the mayor and city 
                      commissioners are having a party 
                    here tomorrow night.  I d like you 
                    to be my guest.  Bring your wife 
                    and family.                                                                                    30.


                                    LAMB
                      I wouldn t know what to do with all 
                    that fun.

      Savino nods, walking them toward Perrin.

                                    SAVINO
                    If you change your mind, you and 
                    your brothers are all welcome.  

      Off Lamb, watching as Savino slices though the crowd. 


      Lamb and Frank walk with Perrin.  Perrin san accountant at 
      heart: reserved, minimal display of emotion.

                                    PERRIN
                      ...Anna was responsible for 
                      determining the credit line for our 
                      guests.  The job requires a great 
                    deal of discretion. 

                                    FRANK
                    You saw her at work Friday?

                                    PERRIN
                    She was there when I left.  Jodie  
                    Kent stayed later.  When she 
                      returned from her break, Anna was 
                    gone.

                                    LAMB
                    Her boyfriend thinks she was seeing 
                      someone here.  Talked about late 
                      nights at work.

                                    PERRIN
                    That part s true.  We promoted her 
                    to our high-roller accounts a few 
                      months ago.  It s a very demanding 
                      position.

      He stops at the entrance to the LUNCHEONETTE.  

                                    PERRIN(CONT D)
                    As far as her romantic life, I d be 
                    the last to know.  You ll probably 
                    have better luck asking them...  

        Perrinpulls open the heavy door.  Three of Anna s CO-WORKERS 
      sit at a booth.  DABBINGtheir eyes with tissues.                                                                                      31.



        A CO-WORKER cries on Frank s shoulder.  He HANDS her his 
        handkerchief.  She takes it and BLOWS her nose loudly.   

      Lamb sits with JODIE KENT, 27.  Taking Anna s death hard. 

                                    JODIE
                    Most of the girls work here to find 
                      a husband... but Anna was 
                      different..  She had already found 
                    her man.  She decided she wanted to 
                    run this place some day.  There s a 
                      million details to remember and 
                    she d write them all down in her 
                      datebook.  Every line, neat and 
                      perfect.  It drove me crazy.  

                                    LAMB
                    Her boyfriend thinks she might have 
                    been seeing someone else.  

                                    JODIE
                    Anna?  No.  She loved Cale.  I 
                    don t think that was her problem.

      Lamb watches her stop short, her thoughts turning inward.

                                    LAMB
                    You want to tell me what was?

                                    JODIE
                    I saw her crying in the powder room 
                      Friday.  She seemed scared.  I 
                    asked if she wanted to talk, but 
                    she said no.  

                                    LAMB
                    You don t have any idea what was 
                      bothering her?

                                    JODIE
                    If I had to guess, it was this 
                      place.  These high-rollers can wear 
                    you down.  They think all that 
                    money gives them a right to push 
                    you around.  And Anna didn t take 
                    to being pushed.

      Off Lamb --


      FIND Lamb and Frank walking out towards the casino.                                                                                     32.


                                    FRANK
                      I checked into Doris Meade.  
                      Family s loaded -- father hit it 
                    big with gold in Ely back in the 
                    20s.  Anna could whistle and her 
                      family d buy her out of any 
                      trouble. 

                                    LAMB
                      Sounds like she wanted to do it her 
                    way.  

      Is sits there with Lamb -- a connection to Anna emerging.  
      Dixon appears in the hallway walking towards them.

                                    DIXON
                      Security last saw Anna in an 
                      elevator around seven.  No one saw 
                    her leave any of the main exits.  

                                    FRANK
                    How else could she get out?

                                    DIXON
                    Back of the kitchen, couple service 
                      doors.  

                                    LAMB
                          (to Frank)
                    Check her accounts, see if she was 
                      having problems with any of the 
                    high rollers. I m going to have a 
                    look around. 

      He turns and walks back in the direction they came. 

                                    FRANK
                    Why?

                                    LAMB
                    She had to get out of here somehow.  

      Lamb PUSHESthrough a swinging door.  As it SWINGS back, we 
      see a  Casino Employees Only  sign. 


      Dank.  Underlit.  This is 1960 -- no eyes in the sky back 
      here.  Pipes run along the ceiling.  Lamb walks deeper...
      past a bathroom with a  WHITES ONLY  sign, down the hall...                                                                                    33.



      On the door Lamb entered.  The door SWINGS again.  Someone s 
      just walked in.  We can t see who.


      Lamb walks down the hallway.  Looks down.  Sees a droplet on 
      the floor.  Leans down.  Looks closer.  Blood.  

      HOLD on Lamb.  Stares down the hallway.  Hears a SOUND. 

      He moves down the hallway.  Sees a utility closet.  He steps 
      forward, twists the handle and pulls the door open --

      INSIDE THE UTILITY CLOSET

      A BELLMAN and a MAID in a frenzied tryst.  Clothes half 
      undone.  They look up, surprised.

                                    BELLMAN
                    Take a picture!

      He SLAMS the door shut.  Lamb s about to leave, stops.  He 
      hears a LOW RUMBLE.  Coming from above.  As he looks up...


      As they exit, Dixon and Frank hear the NOISE, too.  They STEP 
      outside...


      Bikers RIP into the casino.  Tourists LEAP to safety.  
      Blackjack tables are FLIPPED.  Benny Cash watches as --

      A slot machine gets HOOKED by a steel bike chain.  Then  
      YANKED off its base and DRAGGED out of the casino...                                                                                     34.



      The RUMBLE sends a SHUDDER through the pipes.  Lamb s about 
      to walk away when he senses movement.  He turns as --

      A STEEL PIPE flies though the air and CRACKS him in the head.  
      Lamb DROPS.  Into total blackness.


                                      END ACT ONE                                                                                    35.


                                            ACT TWO


      - A PHALANX of BIKERS ride side-by-side down the now-deserted 
      streets.  Like they own the town.  PULL BACK as they pass --


      TIGHT ON LAMB S EYES:  A Doctor shines a penlight in his 
      eyes.  Lamb pans his eyes to see the bikers passing.  The 
      Doctor CLICKS off the light.

                                    DOCTOR
                    We ll keep you overnight for 
                      observation but you should be okay.

      The Doctor exits.  Behind him are Mayor Bennett and D.A. 
      Reynolds.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    It s what you get for pie hawking 
                    those lovebirds.  You re lucky that 
                      bellmanonly popped you once.  

      Lamb gets up from the bed.  Reaches for his shirt.  Not 
      staying overnight.

                                    LAMB
                    It wasn t the bellman.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      That s what hotel security said 
                    when they found you on the floor.  

                                    LAMB
                      I think I got hit because whoever 
                      killed Anna took her out the 
                      service entrance and they were 
                      afraid I d find something.   

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    Did you?
                            (dubious)
                    We went over the area and didn t 
                    find anything.  

                                    LAMB
                    Of course not.  That s why I got 
                    hit.                                                                                    36.


      The Mayor interrupts. 

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    It doesn t matter.  You found 
                      motorcycle tracks by the body.
                    It means those bikers were out 
                      there.  They tore up Barstow, 
                      Boulder City, and now here.

                                    LAMB
                      Tracks don t mean they killed her. 

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    No, but it makes the bikers good 
                      suspects. 

                                    LAMB
                    Cale Green was one, too.  And I m 
                    not sure he did it either. 

      It sits there.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    If we don t do something the 
                      Governor s going to authorize the 
                      National Guard to get those bikers 
                    off the streets. 

      Lamb WINCES as he puts on his boots.

                                    LAMB
                    Not a good idea.  Soldiers marching 
                      outside your casinos with their 
                      rifles can t be good for business.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      I don t suppose you have a better 
                    one?

                                    LAMB
                            (shrugs)
                    I was thinking of a roundup.

      Off Lamb, a twinkle in his eye --


      Broken bottles litter the floor.  Lamb walks in.  SURVEYS the 
      damage.  He steps up to the counter.   Grabs a pack of Juicy 
      Fruit gum off the rack and tosses it on the counter.  

                                    LAMB
                    And a fifth of Cabin Still.

      The frightened CLERKgrabs the bottle off the shelf.  Lamb 
      tries to pay.   He PUSHESthe bottle to Lamb, his hand 
      shaking.  Lamb sees the fear in his eyes.  Leaves a five-
      dollar bill in the counter.  


      -- Bolt cutters SNAP off the Angels  chain bracelets. 

      -- Bikers in underwear are HOSEDdown with disinfectant.

      -- A Deputy SHAVES Monty s head.  One by one, the other 
      bikers get SHORNlike sheep.  CUT TO:


      Monty s SHAVED HEAD.  As shiny as a cue ball.  He s cuffed 
      and clad in Clark County jailwear.  Lamb enters.  

                                    MONTY
                    You didn t say you were the law.

                                    LAMB
                    You didn t ask.

                                    MONTY
                      I want my lawyer.

      Lamb slides a PHOTOof Anna Meade across the table.

                                    LAMB
                    She was found dead next to some 
                      motorcycle tracks.  I got a man out 
                    there checking to see if those 
                      tracks match your tires.  Which 
                    they will.

      Monty remains unfazed.

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                    If one of you killed her, I don t 
                      expect you to say a word.  But if 
                    you saw something, that s a 
                      different story.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  LAMB (CONT D)
                    You got a lot of charges against 
                    you and your friends that might 
                      disappear if you want to help.

      Monty eyeballs him, defiant. 

                                    MONTY
                      I think I asked for my lawyer.


      Lamb steps out to find Lon Simmons waiting.  A troubled look.

                                  LON
                    The tracks match.

                                    LAMB
                    So what s the problem?

                                  LON
                      Flowers.

      He turns and walks down the hallway. 


      The gala event.  B-list movie stars and high-rollers.  
      Tuxedoed waiters carry trays of cocktails and canapes.  

      Lamb enters with Frank and Dixon.  The Lambs are dressed in 
      pressed shirts, Sunday boots.  Dixon grabs two flutes of 
      champagne off the tray of a passing waiter.  He hands them to 
      Frank and Lamb.

                                    DIXON
                      You re here to have fun.  Act like 
                    you belong.

                                    FRANK
                      Except we don t.

                                    DIXON
                    They don t know that.  

      Dixon targets a pair of pretty women approaching.  He flashes 
      his best smile.  Tips his hat.

                                    DIXON (CONT D)
                    Is there an airport nearby or is 
                    that just my heart taking off?

      The women react, charmed.  Dixon takes the champagne from 
      Frank and Lamb and hands it to them.  

                                    DIXON (CONT D)
                    Care to show two very lonely oilmen 
                    from Texas the way around this 
                      soiree?

      He yanks Frank away and the foursome move off into the crowd.  
      Lamb stands alone.  He scans the crowd.  

      ACROSS THE ROOM

      Johnny Savino entertains a small group of guests.  Among 
      them, D.A. Reynolds.  Savino animatedly tells a joke.  The 
      guests laugh.  Savino leans over and whispers to Reynolds, 
      who listens closely.  Lamb notes it as --

                                    KATHERINE (O.S.)
                      Amazing what running water can do. 

      He turns and sees -- Katherine O Connell.  She s dressed for 
      the evening, beautiful in a sinewy dress and heels, a 
        transformation that Lamb can t help but notice.                                                                                      43.


                                    KATHERINE (CONT D)
                      Here s where you tell me I look 
                    nice.

                                    LAMB
                    You look nice.

                                    KATHERINE
                    Well, thank you.  That s very kind.

      There s a tension here, an unspoken attraction.  As they scan 
      the crowd, avoiding talking directly to each other...

                                    KATHERINE (CONT D)
                      Shouldn t you be extracting a 
                      confession from one of our 
                      suspects?

                                    LAMB
                      I would, if I thought any of them 
                    did it.

      Lamb keeps an eye on Savino.  Savino looks over, sees Lamb 
      and Katherine.  So does Reynolds.  Reynolds forces a smile 
      and waves.   A beat, then Savino walks over.

                                    SAVINO
                      Deputy Lamb.  Delighted to see you 
                    could make it. 
                            (winces)
                    Sorry to hear about your incident 
                      earlier.  How s the head?

                                    LAMB
                    Still hard, I ve been told.

                                    KATHERINE
                    I ll second that.

      Savino s eyes drift to Katherine.  He s taken aback by her as 
      well.  Lamb introduces them.

                                    LAMB
                    Mr. Savino.  Assistant District 
                      Attorney Katherine O Connell.

      Savino takes her hand.

                                    SAVINO
                    Big night for law enforcement.  I 
                      better be on my best behavior.  
                          (nods)
                    Miss O Connell.  Deputy Lamb.                                                                                      44.


      He steps to the side, merges with an arriving guest. 

                                    KATHERINE
                    The new boss?

                                    LAMB
                    Fresh from Chicago.

      Lamb takes a stick of chewing gum out of his shirt pocket.  
      Katherine notes it.

                                    KATHERINE
                      Really, Lamb?  Gum?  It s a 
                      terrible habit. 

                                    LAMB
                    I ve heard.

      Lamb slips away.  Off Katherine, speechless, watching him cut 
      through the crowd, FIND --

      SAVINO

      He looks over.  He sees Katherine standing alone.  He turns 
      to Cota and Borelli.  Motions to them.  They move off in 
      pursuit of Lamb... 


      The hallways are deserted.  Everyone is at the party.  Lamb 
      approaches an office. On the door: CREDIT DEPARTMENT.


      Lamb enters.  An OFFICE WORKER looks up.

                                    WORKER
                      Office is closed.

                                    LAMB
                      Sorry.  

      Lamb heads to the door. As he steps out, he takes the gum out 
      of his mouth and shoves it into the door jamb.   


      FIND Lamb watching from behind a corner.  The worker locks up 
      and walks off. 

      Lamb goes back, PUSHES open the door -- the gum has stopped 
      it from locking.  He removes the gum and enters.                                                                                      45.



      Lamb steps over to Anna s desk.  Neat and orderly.  On the 
      desktop: a framed PHOTO.  Anna and Cale, in an embrace out 
      front of their Airstream.  Miles of raw ranch land behind 
      them.

      HOLD ON LAMB:  Taking in the couple.  A connection to a 
      shared past.  The sense of Anna coming to life for him.  

      A beat, then Lamb sets down the photo and RUMMAGESthrough 
      Anna s desk.  PULLSout Anna s datebook.  On the last date -- 
      9/1 -- three account numbers are written down.  Lamb grabs 
      the datebook.  CUT TO: 

      AN OPEN FILE CABINET: 

      Lamb pulls the files listed in the datebook.  He finds the 
      first file and tosses it on the desk behind him. He opens 
      another drawer and finds the second.  He moves on to the 
      third file, goes to the right section in the cabinet.   It s 
      not there.   Lamb goes back and re-checks the number.  He 
      searches again -- the file is missing.

      Lamb goes back to Anna s datebook.  

      TIGHT ON DATEBOOK:  The account number -- 117423.

      Lamb flips pages in the datebook, looking for another entry.  
      Each day, there s an entry for 117423.  He flips to the week 
      before... looks for the day when the account number was first 
      entered.  Finds it:  Tuesday.  Next to the account, Anna has 
        handwritten the word: MONACO.  Off Lamb, registering it --


      The drinking and partying rise to a fever pitch.  Up on 
      stage, Stagehands CARRYa covered 20 ft. long DISPLAY CASE 
      onto the stage.  The Mayor HOVERS at the steps.


      Cota and Borelli heavy-foot their way down the hall.  


      Lamb FLIPS off the light.  He stops as --

      The handle TWISTS.  Then stops.  The door s locked.  Lamb 
      stands in the dark, frozen.  He watches SILHOUETTES of Cota 
      and Borelli pass across the smoked glass...                                                                                      46.



      Cota and Borelli move down the hallway, continuing the hunt.  
      PRELAP: 

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (O.S.)

      The Showgirls unveil a scale-model of the new Vegas: 
      glittering hotels, sparkling palaces of high class 
        entertainment.  The audience explodes into APPLAUSE.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Let s give a big hand to our 
                      generous host, Mr. Johnny Savino!  
                      Johnny, where are you? 
                            (spotlight finds him)
                    There he is!  Johnny, take a bow! 

      To boisterous APPLAUSE, Savino does a half bow.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                    Now join me in welcoming the one 
                    and only... the amazing... the 
                      incomparable... Mr. Jackie Wilson!!

      The curtain RISES and... Jackie Wilson bounds out.  A 20 
      piece BAND kicks in.  It s high octane 60 s Vegas.  

      Savino watches the event unfold.  Then he eyes Lamb emerging 
      from the hallway.  


      Lamb arrives at the front desk.  The CLERK knows Lamb.

                                    CLERK
                    How are you, Ralph?                                                                                    47.


                                    LAMB
                    Hey, Ken.  I m looking for a guest, 
                    last name of Monaco.  Can you check 
                    to see where he s staying?

                                    CLERK
                            (glances at registry)
                    No one by that name.  We have a 
                      Monaco suite up on the third floor.

                                    LAMB
                    Who was staying there Friday night?

                                    CLERK
                            (checks, finds it)
                      Stuart Mills.  Lives in St. Louis.  
                    He s a regular, big-tipper. 
                          (looks again)
                    He left Saturday morning.  Must 
                    have been in a hurry.  Forgot his 
                      wallet and I.D. in the room.  We ve 
                    been calling, but his wife says 
                    he s not home yet. 

      Lamb considers.  A new lead.  He turns --

      Savino stands a few feet away.  A cold smile.

                                    SAVINO
                      Deputy Lamb.  I noticed you stepped 
                    away.  

                                    LAMB
                    I m not much for crowds.

      Savino takes it in.  Smiles.

                                    SAVINO
                    Go back home.  Leave the business 
                    to the real cops. 

                                    LAMB
                      I tend to finish what I start.

      Lamb leaves it there.  Savino s expression darkens.

                                    SAVINO
                    So do I.  I hope you re not gonna  
                    get in my way.

                                    LAMB
                      I can t guarantee I won t.

      A stare down.  Savino sees Lamb isn t going to back down.                                                                                      48.


                                    SAVINO
                    We ll see how that works out.

      Savino turns and walks back to the ballroom.  Off Lamb, 
      resolved, tracking Savino, we CUT TO: 


      Lamb walks into the jail,  Katherine moves alongside him.  

                                    LAMB
                      Name s Stuart Mills.  He was one of 
                      Anna s high-roller accounts.  He 
                      checked out in a hurry the morning 
                    after her murder.  Left his wallet 
                    and I.D. in the room.  

                                    KATHERINE
                      I don t remember you getting a 
                      search warrant to break into 
                      private property?

                                    LAMB
                    The bellman let me in. They thought 
                    they heard a call for help.  

                                    KATHERINE
                    And you just happened to be 
                      standing outside the door?  

                                    LAMB
                    Lucky accident. 

      Lamb rounds the corner to find -- JIM JEFFRIES.  White linen 
      suit.  Fantastic tan. 

                                    JEFFRIES
                    Jim Jeffries.  I just flew in from 
                    L.A.  I represent the motorcycle 
                      enthusiasts you ve erroneously 
                      detained.  I d like to see my 
                      clients.

      Lamb leads him to the CELLS.  The shorn BIKERSsit on floors, 
      lean against the cinder block walls in various states of 
      misery.

                                    LAMB
                    Get up, boys.  Cavalry s here.

      Lamb UNLOCKS the cell door.  Jeffries walks in.  Then Lamb 
      LOCKS it.   Jeffries SPINS --

                                    JEFFRIES
                      Excuse me -- Open that door...

      Lamb walks away.  An astonished Katherine follows.                                                                                    50.


                                    KATHERINE
                    You can t lock him up.

                                    LAMB
                            (shrugs)
                    Why not?  The man wants to talk to 
                    his clients.  He s got thirty 
                      bikers in there. Bound to take him 
                    all day.


      Savino STOPSin view of the jammed casino floor.  Gamblers -- 
        well-dressed and young -- crowd the craps and blackjack 
      tables and roulette wheel.  Screams and groans fill the air.   
      An auditorium with theater seats watch a tote board and TV 
      screens of horse races broadcast from all over the world.    

                                    SAVINO
                    We fly half of our good customers 
                    in on charters every week. It s 
                    worth it. Believe me.  The rest 
                    come in on their own, but they all 
                    leave us something...
                          (tweaks fingers)
                      ...toremember them by. 

                                    BENNY
                    Very nice. Very impressive.

                                    SAVINO
                    You could be a part of this. 

                                    BENNY
                    Me?                                                                                    51.

                    You want to expand?  You want to 
                    sell? You want a partner? You want 
                      a little advice?  I m here.   

      Benny sizes up Savino.  

                                    BENNY
                      Thanks, but you could use some 
                      yourself.

                                    SAVINO
                    Huh?

      Benny walks over to a BLACKJACK TABLE.  A lavish arrangement 
      of FLOWERSis displayed.

                                    BENNY
                    Your flowers are blocking your

                    those flowers there and fire them 
                    on the spot.  

      He hands the flowers to Savino.  Benny leaves.  Off Savino, 
      clutching the flowers --


      Off-strip.  Rodeo posters on the wall.  Lamb slides into the

                      called to verify Mills  income, 
                    since he s taking so many markers 
                    while his income was listed at 15 
                    grand a year.  The manager looks 
                    into it --

                                    DIXON
                          (jumps in)
                    Mills was stealing.

      Frank shoots a look -- 

                                    FRANK
                    Can I finish?

                                    DIXON
                    Am I right?

                                    LAMB
                    I m listening.

                                    FRANK
                          (back to Lamb)
                    Mills was stealing from his job to 
                    pay off his markers over here. No 
                    one had any idea until Anna called.   

                                    DIXON
                      Explains how he paid off his 
                      markers so he could gamble some 
                    more. 

                                    FRANK
                    One of the pit bosses said he was a 
                    real sicko. 
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    53.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Once he showed up and started 
                      shooting craps before even checking 
                    into his room.  Twenty four hours 
                    later he was still at the table and 
                    had lost it all. He picked up his 
                      suitcase and went home. He never 
                    even checked into his room. 

                                    LAMB
                    And this time he had a room, but 
                    took off without his wallet or 
                    cash. What does a guy like this 
                    need most?

                                    DIXON
                    Go home money.

      Lamb peels some bills on the table.  As they slide out...


      Lamb stands by ARTHUR SPEZIALI as he (part-time barber/pawn 
      broker) shaves a customer. Frank thumbs a magazine while 
      Dixon browses the pawned items scattered around the back.  
      Speziali moves the blade slowly.  An artist.  

                                    SPEZIALI
                      Everybody appreciates you getting 
                    those bikes off the street, Ralph. 

      Behind him, Dixon holds up a fly rod. 

                                    DIXON
                    How much?

                                    SPEZIALI
                    Not for sale.  Guys coming back 
                    later today... 
                          (a realist)
                    Or maybe tomorrow. 

                                    LAMB
                    We re looking for a guy. Might be 
                    out of St. Louis.  Flat busted 
                      broke.  He may have been reaching 
                    out for money.

                                    SPEZIALI
                    Is it serious?

                                    LAMB
                    It ll be serious if we don t find 
                    him.                                                                                    54.


                                    SPEZIALI
                          (looks over at Lamb)
                    You got a dollar?

                                    LAMB
                      A dollar?

                                    SPEZIALI
                      I need it to open the register. I m 
                        superstitious.

      Lamb fishes in his pocket for a dollar.

      Speziali takes it to the register and rings up  NO SALE .  
      The cash drawer pops open.  He reaches into the drawer and 
      pulls out a GOLD POCKET WATCH.  He dangles it in front of 
      Lamb. 

                                    SPEZIALI (CONT D)
                    He pawned it for a hundred and 
                      twenty bucks earlier today. 

      Lamb opens the watch.  Engraved inside:  To Stuart, with all 
      my love, Gloria.   

                                    LAMB
                    And?

                                    SPEZIALI
                          (checks pawn tag)
                    He s staying at the Golden Spur.

      Lamb tosses $2 at Speziali.

                                    LAMB
                    Think of the first buck as a tip. 

      Out the door.

                                    LAMB (CONT'D)
                      Thanks. 


      STUART MILLS (pasty, 37) hastily packs his suitcase.  He 
      hears a KNOCK on the door.  HARD CUT TO:


      Mills sits on the bed, head in hands.  In shambles.  Lamb 
      reclines in a chair.  Boots up on the bed.  Frank leans 
      against the wall.  

                                    LAMB
                    Then why are you hiding?

                                    MILLS
                      Because I know how the hell it 
                      looks.   That girl shows up dead 
                    after asking me about the cash in 
                    my account --

                                    FRANK
                    The cash you stole.

      Mills looks up.  They know.  He slumps.  In misery.

                                    LAMB
                    What happened with Anna?

      Mills exhales, in a world of hurt...

                                    MILLS
                    Like I said, she came to my room 
                    last week.  Wanted a source of 
                      income for the money I laid off at 
                    the casino.  I told her I had a 
                    deal with management.  

                                    FRANK
                      Savino.

                                    MILLS
                    Who?  My deal was with Perrin.  

      The brothers exchange a look.

                                    LAMB
                    What kind of deal?                                                                                    57.


                                    MILLS
                    I got into a jam about a year ago.  
                    Got under water big time shooting 
                      craps.  Perrin comes to me, starts 
                      talking about the money. Says they 
                    might have to go to my bank. Tell 
                      everybody about my debts. I ve got 
                      a wife. Kids. 
                          (memory sickens him)
                    ... He said if I wanted to get 
                      straight, I d better start 
                      borrowing from my bank.  

                                    FRANK
                      Sounds more like stealin  than 
                      borrowin .

                                    MILLS
                            (desperate)
                      I didn t have a choice.  

                                    LAMB
                    Who else knew about your 
                      arrangement?

                                    MILLS
                      Nobody.  Perrin wanted to keep it 
                      between us.  He said I could keep 
                      gambling after he got his cut. 
                          (then)
                    It was working out fine. He made my 
                      markers disappear -- 

                                    LAMB
                    Then Anna starts asking questions.    
                    And you didn t like it.

                                    MILLS
                      I didn t touch her.  I swear.  

                                    LAMB
                        A hard-working girl who took pride 
                    in doing her job right.   Must ve 
                      rubbed you the wrong way.  You had 
                    to kill her.

      Mills can t hear it --

                                    MILLS
                    It was Perrin.  He told her to back 
                    off after I complained.  She 
                      wouldn t listen.  She made an 
                      appointment with the top brass.                                                                                     58.


                                    FRANK
                      Perrin couldn t let that happen.  
                      They d know he cooked the books.

                                    MILLS
                      That s when he told me he d take 
                    care of it.  I figured he d make 
                    the problem go away.  Buy the girl 
                    off.  Get her another job.  
                          (a beat)
                    Then I saw the papers.  

      The life drains out of him.  Lamb rises.

                                    LAMB
                      Remember everything you said.  
                    We re gonna go tell it to the D.A.

      He grabs Mills starts to head for the door...


      Etched glass doors SWING open.  Lamb and his brothers move 
      swiftly through the Casino.  Gamblers look up, alarmed -- not 
      sure what to make of the cowboy invasion.   


      Papers strewn everywhere.  A safe is open.  Savino and a team 
      of ACCOUNTANTS frantically search through documents. Lamb 
      breaches the office door.  Pushes past Cota and Borelli.  

                                    LAMB
                      Where s Perrin? 

                                    SAVINO
                            (flustered)
                      I don t know. 

                                    LAMB
                    A lot of your money s missing.

                                    SAVINO
                    How do you know?

                                    LAMB
                      Because we re looking for the guy 
                    who took it.

      He moves past Savino and picks up a photo on Perrin s desk. 
      TOSSESit to Frank -- 

      ON PHOTO:  Perrin stands outside his Cessna.  In the b.g. - 
        McCarrenField.  CUT TO:


      Through the two-way glass, Lamb watches Reynolds interrogate 
        a now-conscious Perrin.                                                                                      61.


      From what Lamb can see, Reynolds is saying a lot and Perrin 
      very little.  Reynolds circles Perrin, frustrated.

      Katherine approaches Lamb.  

                                    KATHERINE
                      A Shangri La maid saw Perrin go in 
                      a second floor room the same time 
                    Anna was in the elevator.  It looks 
                    like he killed her in the room, 
                    then took her body out a service 
                      entrance.  That s why he didn t 
                    want you poking around.

                                    LAMB
                    But nobody saw him with the body? 

                                    KATHERINE
                      Mills  testimony shows intent.

                                    LAMB
                    If a jury believes an embezzler.

                                    KATHERINE
                    I can only work with what I have.

                                    LAMB
                    Maybe you need more.

      Off Katherine, not sure what he s thinking, CUT TO:


      A haggard and unshaven Jeffries rails into Katherine.  Lamb 
      and Monty watch...

                                    LAMB
                      Listen to her.

      A beat.  Katherine resumes.                                                                                    62.

                            (shrugs)
                      -- Those fellas tend to run over 
                      things first, ask questions later.

                                    KATHERINE
                    -- we could not be held 
                      responsible.  However... 

      She slides a pen and paper over to Jeffries and Monty.

                                    KATHERINE (CONT D)
                    ... should you cooperate with the 
                      murder investigation, we ll 
                      guarantee suspended sentences on 
                    the vandalism charges and your 
                      clients will ride away free men.  
                    On their bikes.  
                          (turns to Monty)
                    With the agreement you never come 
                    back to Vegas.

      Monty s eyes land at Katherine.  Lets his gaze linger.   

                                    MONTY
                    Does that pretty mouth do more than 
                    talk?

      Out of nowhere, Lamb PUNCHESMonty.  The hit SNAPS his head 
      back.  

                                    LAMB
                    That was rude.  

      Monty processes, rubbing his eye.  Lamb reasons with him.

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                      A good bike s like a good horse.   
                    You find one you like, you don t 
                    let it go.

      A beat.  Monty considers.  Relents.

                    After that second night in Boulder 
                    City, a few of us went riding out 
                    in the flats.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    63.

                                    MONTY (CONT'D)
                    We came across this guy... dragging 
                      something off the road.  He sees 
                    us, runs to his car, hightails it 
                    out of there.  We ride up closer, 
                    see that dead girl.  Then we got 
                    the hell out of there.  Who was 
                    going to believe we didn t do it?  
                    Not you.

                                    LAMB
                    Did you get a look at the guy?

                                    MONTY
                    Too dark.   

                                    LAMB
                    What about his car?

                                    MONTY 
                    One of those convertibles.  A 
                      Pontiac. 

      He leaves it there, not knowing it s important.  Lamb and 
      Katherine exchange a look.  They do.


      Savino enters.  Slightly rattled.  He PAUSES at the kitchen 
      door.  Puts on his game face.  PUSHES open the door...


      Back past the cooks and the stoves, a small table.  A small 
        grey-haired woman works over a steaming pot.  Tuna sits 
      reading the Las Vegas Sun.  Splashed across the front page: a 
      PHOTO of Perrin being led to jail by Lamb.  

                                    TUNA
                    How much did he get us for?

                                    SAVINO
                    Not that much. Accounting can 
                      handle it. 

                                    TUNA
                    Good.

      He points to the photo of Perrin.

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                    What about this one?                                                                                    64.


                                    SAVINO
                    I ve got people inside who can 
                      handle him.  

      Tuna nods.  One problem taken care of.  Savino s eyes drift 
      to Lamb.  Tuna reads him.

                                    TUNA
                    And the cowboy?  Is he going to be 
                      a problem.

                                    SAVINO
                      Forget him.  I m gonna enjoy 
                      handling him on my own.

                                    TUNA
                    Good boy.  That s all I gotta know.

      Savino readies to leave.  Tuna stops him.

                                    TUNA (CONT'D)
                    Where you going?   My mom s been 
                      cooking all day.  Sit down.

      Tuna pulls out chair.  The grey-haired lady -- MRS. TUNA -- 
      prepares a dish.  Savino sits.  Mrs. Tuna brings over the 
      plate of pasta.

                                    MRS. TUNA
                      Careful, it s hot.

      She sets down the plate.

                                    SAVINO
                      Thanks, Mrs. T.

                                    TUNA
                      I told you you d like it out here.  

      As Tuna and Savino dig in, we CUT TO --


      Frank drives, Lamb next to him.  Following the bikers.  The 
      highway stretches ahead of them, out into endless desert.                                                                                      65.


                                    LAMB 
                    Here.


      Frank drives back to town.  

                                    FRANK
                    Doc Andrews is coming over to 
                      vaccinate the new calves Tuesday.  

      Lamb s gaze falls out the window. A herd of lazy cattle sun 
        themselves.  Life getting back to normal.  

      A few cars pass by, HONK horns.  The drivers WAVE.  Then pull 
      U-turns.

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                    We ll need to add some hands.  I m 
                      thinking Teddy, Lupek --
                            (looking out)
                    What the hell?

      More carsdrive out.  Passengers WAVEoutstretched arms, 
      saluting them.  They WHIP into U-turns and follow the truck.  
      Frank peers into the rear-view.  

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                      Brother Lamb, I believe we got 
                      ourselves a parade.


      Frank stops.  He reaches over Lamb and throws OPENthe door.  

                                    FRANK
                    You going to stay in here all day?
