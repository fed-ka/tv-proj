      FADE IN:

      INT. CBI HQ - DAY (D/1)11

      A crew-cut State Marshal, anxiety on his face, holding a slip 
      of paper, enters via the double doors, hurries down the 
      hallway and around past the spiral stairs into the BULLPEN, 
      where he pauses long enough to realize he's in the wrong 
      place and hurries on toward Lisbon's office.

      RIGSBY, VAN PELT and CHO are working and JANE is lying on the 
      sofa, doing a Sudoku puzzle really fast. 

                                  CHO
                    He's from the AG's office.  We're 
                    catching a hot one.

                                  JANE
                    Hooray.  I am about to go mad with 
                    boredom.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Don't say hooray.  Someone's died. 

                                  JANE
                    If they have, my happiness makes no 
                      difference to them.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Nor does catching their killer for 
                    that matter.

                                  JANE
                    True.  But it makes a big 
                      difference to the killer.

      LISBON enters holding a sheet of paper. 

                                  LISBON
                          (grumpy)
                    This is an E-Mail received twenty 
                    minutes ago by the Attorney General and 
                    the Governor.  "Pay attention.  At 
                    exactly eleven-oh-five AM today, at 
                    latitude 35.047 and longitude 116.49, 
                    you will see an arrogant and greedy 
                    person punished with death and you will 
                    know I am serious -- signed, Joe Q 
                    Public."

                                  JANE
                      Interesting.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      2.
      CONTINUED:11

                                  LISBON
                    Probably nothing.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Why not let the local police handle 
                    it then?  

                                  LISBON
                    Some fool let the Governor read the 
                    damn thing.  So he talks to the AG,  
                    the AG talks to Minelli, and 
                    Minelli tells me we need to cover 
                    it, personally.  Rigsby, you're the 
                    fastest driver.  Let's go.  If we 
                    leave now and push it, we can be 
                    there at eleven-oh-five.  

      Rigsby grabs his stuff.

                                  JANE
                    Where is it? 

                                  LISBON 
                    The Mojave Desert.  Middle of 
                    nowhere, a quarter mile off the 
                    highway.  

                                  JANE
                      Interesting.  

                                  LISBON
                    Three hours away.  Boring. 

                                  JANE 
                    But the desert is beautiful this 
                    time of year.
                          (jumps up off sofa)
                    Let's all go.  We can bring a 
                    picnic lunch.

      Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt murmur agreement, 'Yeah that would 
      be a laugh.'  Lisbon sighs.

                                  LISBON
                    Someone has to stay to answer the 
                    phone.

      Van Pelt looks glum.  She's the rookie.

      EXT. MOJAVE DESERT - DAY22

      Jane, Lisbon, Rigsby and CHO walk across open desert.  Jane has 
      a paper bag of sandwiches.  Rigsby has a SHOTGUN.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      3.
      CONTINUED:22

      Cho has a hand-held GPS that he uses to guide them on their way.  
      The Sierra Nevada mountains rise up before them on the horizon.

      Lisbon is grumpy.  Jane is happy to be out and about.     

                                  LISBON
                    How much further?

                                  CHO
                      Forty-nine meters. 

      They walk on a while.  It is beautiful out here.  Jane stops 
      and picks a pebble-size object off the ground. 

                                  JANE 
                    Look at that.  Look what I found.  

                                  LISBON 
                    What is it?

                                  JANE
                    It's a worm.  A fossilized worm.

                                  LISBON
                    I'm happy for you. 

      Jane et al reach a wide circular clearing in the creosote 
      bushes and cactus.

                                  CHO 
                    This is it.  This is the spot.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (looks at watch)
                      Eleven-oh-four and change.  Right 
                    on time.

                                  LISBON
                    For what?  

      They look around.  Nothing and nobody in sight.

                                  CHO
                    There's still fifteen seconds to go.

                                  JANE 
                    When this worm was alive all of 
                    this desert was the floor of a 
                    great sea, and there were dinosaurs 
                    swimming above us.

                                  RIGSBY
                    That is kind of awesome.

      Jane gives the rock to Cho. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      4.

                                  JANE
                    Sharks as big as buses.  
                      Brilliantly colored sea monsters.  
                    Those mountains were volcanos.  

                                  CHO
                    This is a goat turd, about six 
                    months old.  

      He tosses it.  Beat.

                                  JANE 
                    Still, there were giant sharks here.

                                  LISBON 
                    Okay.  We've done our job.  Someone 
                    jerked our chain pretty good. Let's go. 

                                  JANE
                    Wait.  We should wait a little.

                                  LISBON
                    For what?  What could possibly happen? 

                                  JANE
                    I have no idea.  But it's a pleasant 
                    spot, and we have sandwiches.

                                  LISBON
                    Eat them in the car.  We've wasted 
                    enough time.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Hey, d'you hear that?

      They all listen. We HEAR A FAINT SCREAMING NOISE, getting 
      louder...

                                  LISBON 
                    Yes.

                                  CHO
                    What is tha...

      Jane looks directly up and they all do likewise... 

      THEIR POV -- a MAN PLUMMETS FROM THE SKY directly above them, 
      his face in a rictus of wide-eyed open-mouthed screaming fear.  
      BLAAAM -- He hits the ground right in front of them, raising a 
      cloud of dust.  ON their stunned expressions...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (D/1 CONT'D)33

      The same scene an hour after impact.  Now there's COPS and 
      FORENSICS TECHS, a coroner's truck and a couple of sheriff's 
      vehicles and TWO NEWS CREWS at the roadside, a thousand yards 
      from Whitaker's body.  

      Rigsby takes details from JOYCE TRAN, one of FIVE PEOPLE IN 
      JUMPSUITS toting helmets.  (They are Tran, NADIA SOBELL,    
      DE SHAUN BRAEMAR, HOLDEN PEARY and RAND FAULK.  Those not 
      talking to Rigsby are blackberrying.  I'll describe each of 
      them as they introduce themselves into the story.)

      Cho walks away from the body toward this scene as he breaks 
      it down on the phone...

                                  CHO
                    Our victim's name is David 
                      Whittaker.  One of a party of six 
                    casual sky divers that went up with 
                    an instructor this morning.  
                    All executives of a company called 
                    Carnelian Prime Trust, out here on 
                      a corporate adventure retreat.  Our 
                    victim was VP of human resources.

                    Trust.  Got it.  I'll start 
                    digging.  

      EXT. MOJAVE DESERT - CONTINUOUS55

      Cho heads back to the road where all the big vehicles are 
      parked, taking us to...

      ANGLE -- By the CBI VEHICLE, in a personalized jumpsuit, Jane 
      and Lisbon talk with MIKE SPRUELL (40's crew-cut ex-military) 
      as he examines the HARNESS that the dead man was wearing.  







                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      6.
      CONTINUED:55

                                    SPRUELL 
                    Yes, see?  Right here?  The master 
                    strap was cut nearly all the way 
                    through.  That has to be 
                      deliberate.  That's evil.  

      INSERT:  On the harness; a tell tale clean-edged cut through 
      most of the strap. 

                                    SPRUELL (CONT'D)
                    The whole shebang would have just 
                    ripped apart when deployed.  The 
                    chute would come clean off.

                                  LISBON
                    Who rigged the chutes?

                                    SPRUELL
                    Me.  I did.  Yesterday evening. 
                    And double-checked every one of 
                    them A-Okay.  I guarantee it.  
                    This, this was done afterwards. 

                                  JANE
                    By someone who knows about 
                      parachutes.

                                    SPRUELL
                    Yes.  I've been rigging chutes for

                    There's a number here.  Is there 
                    any way to identify which chute 
                    would go with which jumper?  Are 
                    they assigned to individuals?

                                    SPRUELL 
                    No.  I have the jumpers pick up the 
                    first one they come to and put it 
                    on.  The rigs are only numbered for 
                      maintenance logs.

                                  LISBON
                    Who had access to the chutes after 
                    you rigged them?

                    They were in the hangar overnight.

                    So anyone with access to the 
                    airport, basically.

      Spruell nods.  Rand Faulk approaches and interrupts with an 
      air of natural command.  He's a big tall handsome man.  

                                  FAULK
                    Agent Lisbon, is it?   We're 
                    leaving.  Keep my office informed.
                          (to Spruell)
                    You'll be hearing from our lawyers.  

      Faulk strides away, talking to his EARPHONE.  He waves his 
      hand in the air and a BLACK LIMO and a BLACK HIGH-END SUV 
      glide to rest at his side. 

                                  FAULK (CONT'D)
                    ...Yes.  Do it now.  But at two 
                    point five...
                          (listens)
                    Tell him I don't care.  

      Lisbon shakes her head, amused rather than angered by Faulk's 
      manner.  Jane looks at her, as to say, are you going to let 
      him get away with that?

                                  LISBON
                    Hush.
                          (beat, raises her voice 
                            just enough)
                    Mr. Faulk.  

      Faulk turns around.   

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    This is a murder investigation.
                    You can't leave until we say you 
                    can leave. 

      Faulk is given pause, he takes a beat before choosing a 
      patronizing smile.

                                  FAULK
                      I apologize.  I thought we'd 
                    answered all your questions.  
                    Do we have your permission to 
                    leave, Agent Lisbon?  

                                  LISBON
                    Yes you do.  But we'll have a lot 
                    of follow-up questions.

                    Yes we do.  See you soon, Mr. 
                    Faulk.

      Beckoning briskly to Sobell, Faulk gets into the limo and 
      Sobell follows.  The other Carnelian execs get into the SUV, 
      and the two cars glide away.  

      Off Lisbon's showdown with Faulk, Jane mimes putting away six 
      guns.  Lisbon waves off the teasing compliment, and addresses 
      Cho and Rigsby as they approach and walk together toward 
      their vehicles. 

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)

      Faulk gives Sobell a warning look and gesture.  She gives him 
      one right back.  They have a close relationship, obviously.

                      A bonding.  A rite of passage.  
                    What we learn here about ourselves 
                    and each other is at the core of 
                      Carnelian's philosophy of success.  
                    There will come an appropriate 
                    moment to mourn our dear friend.  
                    This moment is a time to show 
                    resolve, and courage.  

      Agreement from the others, albeit grudgingly from Sobell.

      walked in.  There's guns mounted on the wall, survivalist 
      paraphernalia everyplace.  As they talk, her kids REBA and 
      CODY come in and out.  The baby's audible but unseen in a 
      cot.

                    Ma'am...

                    I don't even want to look at you 
                    people, you make me too mad.  Lee's 
                    done nothing!  Nothing!  

                                  JANE
                    Jessie, if your husband is 
                    innocent, we're your best friends.  
                    We will prove he's innocent.  Will 
                    you help us?  

      Beat.

                    Yes.  And yes, I could have gotten 
                    into Spruell's hangar and messed 
                    with that parachute, but I didn't.   
                    I worked my shift and went home.  
                    That's all I did.  I didn't even 
                    know those Carnelian people were 
                    there jumping that day, and I 
                    wouldn't give a damn if I did know.

                                  SKELLING
                    Okay, I would give a damn.  I have 
                    always wanted to talk to those 
                    people face to face.  They could 
                    have given me that money.  It's 
                    peanuts to them.  Nothing.  I would 
                    want to ask them why, is all.  But 
                    cut a man's chute?  No.

                          (laughs, shakes head)
                    I mean, that's bad.  That's out

                    Lee is a God fearing man.  He 
                    couldn't kill somebody like that.  
                    No way. 

                                  JANE
                    He was a soldier.  He can kill.

                                  JESSIE SKELLING
                    For his country.  Not for himself.

                                  JANE
                    What's the difference d'you think?

                                  JESSIE
                    I don't know what it is.  But it's 
                    all the difference in the world.

                                  JANE 
                    You're very confident of his 
                      innocence.  How can you be so sure?

                                  JESSIE SKELLING
                    I asked him if he did it.  And he 
                    said no he didn't do it.  

                                  JANE
                    You suspected he might indeed have 
                    done it, but he denied it.  And you 
                    believe him.

                                  JESSIE SKELLING
                    Lee don't lie to me.  He'll cause 
                    me trouble and grief a hundred 
                    which ways, but he won't lie to me. 

                                  JANE
                    Wives often say that about their 
                    husbands.  Easy to fool yourself that 
                    the people you love are honest.

                                  JESSIE SKELLING
                    Yes it is.  But I know he wouldn't.

      Jane taps at his own hair to indicate Jessie's.

                                  JANE
                    Because you're sick?

      Jessie TAKES HER HAIR OFF.  It's a WIG.  Underneath which, 
      she's nearly bald -- the telltale effects of chemo. 

                                  JESSIE SKELLING

                    sitting with The Almighty pretty 
                    soon.  

      Jessie puts her hair back on.

                    to do?  Cody, don't you eat that...

      Jessie jumps up and grabs some kibble from the kid's hand and 
      puts it back in the sack of dog food.  

                                  JESSIE SKELLING (CONT'D)
                          (to the kid)
                    You want something to eat, there's 
                    some peanut butter in the cupboard.

      Coming back to her seat facing Lisbon, Jessie's wig is 
      slightly askew.  Lisbon points at the wig and makes a 
      straightening gesture.  Jessie straightens it.  Lisbon nods.  
      Checks her notes.

                                  LISBON 
                    The night before last, what time 
                    did Lee come home?

                                  JESSIE SKELLING
                    Same as every night, half past 
                    midnight.  My husband did not do 
                    this thing.  If he went to jail, 
                    who would look after the children?  
                    They'd go into care.  He wouldn't 
                    do that to me.  He wouldn't.

                    Your wife says you wouldn't do that 
                    to her.  But I don't know.  Maybe 
                    you would if you thought you could 
                    get away with it.

                    When I was working for Grant 
                      Aerospace, Jessie was getting the 
                    best treatment for her sickness.  
                    If I hadn't of bitched and moaned 
                    and made a nuisance of myself, I 
                    would still have a job and health 
                    insurance and Jessie would be okay.
                          (beat)
                    So why did I bitch and moan, right?  
                    Why couldn't I be quiet and keep 
                    the job?  I don't know.  I don't 
                    know.

                    Something like that I guess.  
                    If I thought I could get away with 
                    it?  Yes, I would kill every last 
                    one of those bastards.  But you

                    No.  I think you just want him to

                                  FAULK
                    Good morning.  I understand that 
                    you released a promising suspect. 

                                  JANE
                    Meh.  We don't like him for it.
                    We think, that is, I think, Agent 
                    Lisbon disagrees with me, I think 
                    that the answer lies with one of 
                    you here. 

                                    BRAEMAR
                    That's absurd. 

                                  JANE
                    Why?  

                                  SOBELL
                    You're saying one of us sabotaged 
                    David's parachute?

                                  JANE 
                    Why not?  The chutes were all 
                    clearly numbered.  The saboteur 
                    would simply have to make sure not 
                    to choose the dud.

                                  PEARY
                    But they couldn't know who would 
                    pick the dud.  They'd be killing a 
                    randomly selected colleague.  Why 
                    would anyone want to do that?

                    Yes.  Don't know yet.  But we'll 
                    find out.  Tell us a little about 
                      yourselves.  Let's use this sadness 
                    to get to some real truths, shall 
                    we?  You first, Joyce.

                                  TRAN
                          (smiling brightly)
                    Me first to do what exactly? 

                                  JANE
                    I'll tell you what I think, just to 
                    get the ball rolling.  I think 
                    you've made your way in the world 
                    by concealing your true feelings 
                    under a mask of positivity and 
                    niceness.  Underneath, you're a 
                    seething mass of ugly bitter 
                      resentment. 

      Tran looks sour and opens her mouth to make a caustic reply, 
      but Jane turns to Peary.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You think Faulk is a stupid 
                    buffoon, but you're far too clever 
                    to be brave and tell him so.

                                  PEARY
                    How dare --

      Jane's moved on already.

                                  JANE 
                    -- And you, Mr. Braemar.  Marine 
                    Corps, yes?  Office politics must 
                    feel kind of trivial in comparison.  
                    How often do you fantasize pulling 
                    out a couple of weapons and showing 
                    these civilians a little reality? 

      Braemar shakes his head in disgust and puzzlement.

                                    BRAEMAR
                    That's baseless and inappropriate.  
                    And I resent it.

      Cooby, the Ranch Manager comes over.

                    We'll be right there.  Agent 
                    Lisbon, this is a high profile 
                    case.  A career defining case if 
                    concluded successfully.  Are you 
                    sure this is how you wish to 
                    proceed?  With clownish games?

      Lisbon deadpans him with a civil servant face.

                      I apologize.  Mr. Jane is a

                    I'm simply trying to get a full 
                    picture of the group dynamic here.  
                    For instance, does anyone resent 
                    the sexual relationship between 
                    Faulk and Mizz Sobell?  Any of you?   

      The look on the faces of the execs tells us Jane is on 
      target.

                                  SOBELL
                    Why would anyone resent it?  

                                  FAULK
                    Don't engage with him, Nadia.

                                  JANE

      SIGNS for fresh strawberries, apples and corn in both English 
      and Spanish, beckon to passing drivers.  A brazier smokes in 
      the BG.  A handful of CUSTOMERS mill about with baskets of 
      produce.  Jane and Lisbon walk back from the stall and lean 
      against the passenger door of the CITROEN, eating fruit. *

                    What's weird about those guys, 
                    none of them really gives a damn. 
                      A colleague falls out of the sky 
                    and they're pretty much okay with 
                    it.  Is that guilt or indifference? 

                                  JANE
                    Corporate brainwashing.  It's

                                  LISBON
                    I don't buy that.  People make up 
                    their own minds.  You can't

                    Primitive brainwashing via group  *

      A realization dawns.  Jane stops the car, turns it around and

      Faulk asleep, in moonlight.  Footsteps approach, the door 
      busts open and Jane walks in, switches on the light.

      Faulk sits up in befuddled alarm and indignation.

                                  FAULK
                    What the hell!?  What are you 
                    doing? 

      Lisbon follows Jane in.

                                  LISBON
                    Bear with us, Mr. Faulk.  We have 
                    reason to believe -- 

      Jane's on the floor looking under Faulk's bed.

                    -- Yes.  There it is.

                    Told you so.

      Lisbon ducks down to look.  Sees the bomb.

                                  LISBON
                          (very calm)
                    No need to gloat.  Mr. Faulk, 
                    there's an explosive device of some 
                    kind under your bed. 

      Faulk's eyes go wide.

                                  FAULK
                    Oh my God.

      He moves to get out of bed.

                    No.  I don't think it has a 
                    pressure trigger.  You can get up. 

                                  FAULK
                          (querulous)
                    You don't think?

                                  LISBON
                    I'm pretty sure it doesn't. 
                    It's timed to go off at midnight.  So 
                    we have plenty of time yet.  If you'll 
                    get up slowly now... We don't want to 
                    jar the device in any way...

      Faulk gets slowly off the bed.  

                                  JANE
                    BOOM.

      To his credit, Faulk doesn't jump in alarm, but simply glares 
      at Jane -- like, are you nuts? -- as he exits the room fast.   
      Lisbon looks at him the same way as they exit also...

                                  LISBON

      Jane yawns. 

      NEW ANGLE reveals a bomb squad van in BG.  Then a BOMB SQUAD

                    She's a nasty little girl.  Timed 
                    to blow at midnight.  Anyone inside 
                    twenty feet would have been red 
                    mist.  But see this little wire 
                    here?  It came loose at some point.  
                    Disarmed her.  Silly mistake.

                                  LISBON
                    Huh.  Lucky.  

      Jane starts to poke at the device, inquisitive as ever. 

                                  BOMB SQUAD OFFICER
                    Don't do that.  Even when it's 
                    disarmed, if you touch the red 
                    terminal, that'll close the 
                    circuit, and we're barbecue.

                                  JANE
                    Good to know.

                    Looks like expert work.

                                  BOMB SQUAD OFFICER
                      Absolutely.  You got hi-test Army 
                    ordinance combined neatly with a 
                    hobby store trigger.  Whoever made

                    being slick enough to sneak in here 
                    and plant this girl.

      Faulk is interviewed by a FEMALE TV NEWS JOURNALIST.

                    Carnelian is a company founded on 
                    good American values, and one of 
                    those values, Sarah, is courage in 
                      adversity.  These tragic 
                      circumstances will only make us 
                    stronger.  We will be a better 
                    company for this.  The sick 
                      individual behind this campaign 
                    against us will not effect us in 
                    any way.

      Jane, Lisbon, Van Pelt, Rigsby and Cho watching FAULK ON

                    We will not be intimidated.

      Lisbon switches off the TV. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Fool.  Playing the hero.  He'll get 
                    himself killed.

                                  LISBON
                    He has to look tough.  Carnelian 
                    has to turn this to their PR 
                    advantage or it could really hurt 
                    their business. 

                                  JANE
                    How's Carnelian's stock price?

      Van Pelt is fast.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Down fifteen percent since 
                      Whittaker's death and still       
                    dropping.

                                  JANE
                    I wonder whether anyone made money 
                    off that drop?

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  If you know beforehand that 
                    Carnelian is going to be targeted 
                    by Joe Public, because you are Joe 
                    Public, betting against them on the 
                    markets would be easy money. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Couldn't be Lee Skelling then.      
                    He's got no money to bet with.

                                  JANE
                    It's not Skelling.  We know that 
                    already.

                                  LISBON
                    You know that.  We're keeping an 
                    open mind.

      Lisbon looks to Van Pelt, who nods keenly.

                                  VAN PELT
                    On it.  I'll run the market trading 
                    logs.  See if anybody made a 
                    killing, so to speak.

      Van Pelt, a little disappointed to get no laugh, starts 
      tapping rapidly at the keyboard. 

                                  LISBON
                    Any word on Skelling? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    A couple of potential sightings in 
                    the Mount Whitney area.  Locals and 
                    the parks service are all over it.  
                    We'll get him.

                                  JANE
                    Doubt it.  Skelling is in his 
                    element up there.  This is his 
                      survivalist fantasy life come true.  
                    Probably got a place all prepped.  
                    He'll go to ground like a grizzly 
                    bear.

      They turn to Van Pelt.

      With goggles and camo gear on, Nadia Sobell moves stealthily 
      through the trees, paintball gun at the ready, scanning for 
      "enemies."  

      Her POV -- she catches sight of De Shaun Braemar, up ahead, 
      unaware that's he been seen.  

      Sobell creeps forward, silently as can be, like a real 
      sniper.  Braemar pauses in a clear spot.  Sobell rises to 
      take up a shooting position.  Levels her gun and WAP -- hits

                    Nothing recent, but the last good

                    she wasn't there.  And I started 
                    yelling for help.

                    That's alright.  The barb is well 
                    placed.  I can see clearly now. 
                    I've been wrong.  This company has 
                    been wrong.  I'm going to issue a 
                      statement.  An apology.

                                    BRAEMAR
                    No.  No.  You can't give in to this 
                    psycho.

                                  FAULK 
                    Not an apology to Joe Public, to 
                    the general public.  The people.  
                    Carnelian is going to change its 
                    ways and become a new company.  
                    Redeemed by suffering.  Reborn and 
                      rebranded.  Ethical, honest, clean.

                    Of course.  It all fits.  This is

                    Let's go ask him.

      Jane goes back to Faulk, speaks quietly so the others can't 
      hear.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Faulk, where's Jake Cooby at

                    The bullet that killed Nadia was

                    certainly belonged to Jake.

4444INT. KITCHEN. BLUE JAY RANCH - DAY 

      Jane puts a kettle on the stove.  Jane and Faulk have just 
      this minute confronted Cooby.

                                  COOBY
                    You saying it's me?  I shot her?

                                  JANE
                    Yes, and cut Whittaker's parachute, 
                    and planted the bomb that nearly 
                    killed Mr. Faulk here. 

                                  COOBY
                    I surely did not.  Why in heck 
                    would I do all that?

                                  JANE
                    That's what we want to know.

                                  COOBY
                          (stunned)
                    Are you guys for real?  Come on.  
                    How long have you known me Mr. 
                    Faulk?

                                  FAULK
                    Why Jake?  What have I ever done to 
                    you that would justify this?  Help 
                    me understand.

      Cooby's angry now.

                                  COOBY
                    Okay, now see here, I don't know 
                    how, but you got the wrong idea 
                    about me.  

                                  JANE
                    Is that right?  Why was it one of 
                    your prize bullets that killed 
                    Nadia Sobell?    

                                  COOBY 
                    It was?

      Jane opens up the bag at his feet, and pulls out the TIME 
      BOMB that was found under Faulk's bed. 

                                  JANE 
                    And why did you make this clever 
                    thing?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      46.

      Cooby's confused by how wrong Jane is.  Faulk is alarmed.  

                                  COOBY
                    Huh?  What?  Is that a bomb?

                                  JANE
                    It's your bomb, Jake.  You made it. 

                                  COOBY
                    No I didn't.  What are you smoking, 
                    man?

                                  JANE 
                    No?  Really?  This isn't your 
                    trigger?

      Jane 'inadvertently' throws the on/off switch on the device 
      as he offers it to Cooby.  The CLOCK starts ticking down 
      TWENTY SECONDS.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Oh.

                                  COOBY
                    Is that...?

                                  FAULK
                    Oh for Godsake! 

      Jane tries to hand the device to Cooby, but Cooby's backing 
      away.  In BG the kettle is boiling.

                                  JANE
                    Okay.  Everybody needs to calm 
                    down.  No problem...

      Jane peers at the device. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Looks like it'll disarm if I pull 
                    the wire out of this red terminal 
                    here... 

                                  FAULK
                    No!!

      Faulk snatches the device out of Jane's hand and deftly pulls 
      out the correct wire to disarm rather than detonate.  The 
      bomb's safe.  Faulk puts it down on the kitchen table.

                                  FAULK (CONT'D)

                                  JANE 
                    You knew how to disarm that bomb. 
                    Because you made it.  You planted 
                    it to divert suspicion from 
                    yourself, ergo it was you that 
                    killed Whittaker and Sobell.

      Faulk affects amusement. 

                                  FAULK
                    I'm sorry to spoil your theory, but 
                    it was obvious how to disarm the 
                    bomb.

      Cooby's in BG fascinated, as if at Wimbledon.

                                  JANE
                    No it wasn't.  I bet you ninety 
                    percent of people would think 
                    pulling this wire here would be the 
                    right thing to do.

      He pulls the wire out of the red terminal and Faulk recoils 
      and screams... 

                                  FAULK
                    Noooo!

      Nothing happens.  

                                  JANE
                    The bomb squad took the explosive 
                    out.  This is Playdoh.  And you are 
                      a wretched, scheming, cold-hearted 
                    murderer.  

      Faulk uncurls from an ignominious crouch, conscious he has 
      truly blown his cover now; morally if not legally.

                                  FAULK
                    You're mad.

      Jane turns off the boiling kettle.

                    Mr. Cooby, where do you keep the 
                    tea?

      Cooby points.  Jane finds tea bags.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      48.

      Cooby exits.  Jane makes his cup of tea.  Faulk's in an 
      unfamiliar game, playing defense.

                    Oh legal proof will be found no 
                    doubt.  But personally, I don't 
                    need it.  I just like to know I'm 
                    right.  

      Jane sips at his tea, content.  Lisbon enters.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Agent Lisbon, arrest this man.

                                  FAULK
                    This is absurd!

      Lisbon looks at Jane deadpan, waiting.

                                  JANE
                    Arrest this man, please.

      Satisfied, Lisbon takes her cuffs out.

4545INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - DAY 

      Faulk sits.  Jane paces.

                                  JANE
                    I knew it was you as soon as the 
                    bomb under your bed failed to go 
                    off.  Too clever, Randy.  Too 
                    clever. 

                                  FAULK
                    Don't call me Randy.

      Cho enters, sits opposite Faulk, puts a file on the table.  
      Faulk looks at it.

                                  JANE
                    But why would you want to randomly 
                    kill one of your executives?  
                    Didn't make sense.  Then Sobell was 
                    shot and I saw your game, Randy. 

                                  FAULK
                    That's very childish.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      49.

                                  JANE
                      Whittaker's death was merely 
                      camouflage to disguise Sobell's 
                    death.  She's the one you needed 
                    dead.

                                  FAULK
                    I won't say anything until my 
                    lawyer arrives, but suffice to say, 
                    you have no proof.  Nothing.

                                  JANE
                    Question is, what did Sobell have 
                    on you?  What was she going to do?  

                                  FAULK 
                    Nothing. 

                                  JANE
                    That was a rhetorical question.  We 
                    know everything we need to now.

      Cho opens the file.  Reads.

                                  CHO
                    This is an affidavit from Nadia 
                    Sobell's lawyer.  Nadia was 
                    secretly negotiating to join KBT, 
                    your number one rival.  She was 
                    also drafting a sexual harassment 
                    suit against you to coincide with 
                    her departure.  That's why she was 
                    shorting Carnelian stock.  And 
                    that's why you needed to kill her.

                                  JANE
                    Because nobody gets on top of 
                    Randall Faulk, do they?  Nobody. 

                                  FAULK
                    Where's my lawyer?

                                  JANE 
                    I have to tell you, the whole Joe 
                    Public ruse was genius.  I couldn't 
                    see how it would profit you to 
                    attack your own company.  But you, 
                    you have vision.  Carnelian reborn 
                    and rebranded.  Everybody loves a 
                    comeback.  Everybody loves 
                      redemption. 

                                  FAULK
                    You have nothing.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST      "Carnelian"      GREEN 3/13/09      50.

                                  CHO
                    We have enough to rip you to 
                    pieces.

                                  JANE
                    And you know it.  Before your 
                    lawyer arrives and ties everybody's 
                    hands, let's make a deal.

      Beat.

                                  FAULK
                    I'm listening.

                                  JANE
                    We'll call Whittaker manslaughter 
                    one, we'll forget about the bomb, 
                    and we won't ask for the death 
                    penalty.    

      This isn't procedure and Cho's about to speak, but Jane gives 
      him a glance asking for forbearance.  Faulk looks bleak.

                                  FAULK
                    In exchange for what?

      EXT. SKELLING PLACE - DAY (D/4)4646

      Morning.  

      INT. SKELLING PLACE - DAY4747

      On the kitchen table is a RIPPED OPEN ENVELOPE AND A 
      CARNELIAN CHECK.  It's made out to the Skellings in the sum 
      of five hundred grand, and it's signed by Randall Faulk.  Lee 
      and Jessie Skelling do a sort of hug/slow dance. 

      Their raggedy ass kids sit at the kitchen table beaming, at 
      the novel sight of Mom and Dad happy for the first time in 
      who knows how long.  

                                                                        FADE OUT.
