Mealtime.  Long, rough hewn tables.  Mary is cleaned up but 
in a drab uniform, sitting in a sea of girls.  Nuns at the 
far end, being served first, as Sr. Agnes joins them; begins 
eating as the servers make their way toward Mary s end.  
Conversation BUZZING all around.

ON MARY, trying to engage in the chatter, but feeling Sr. 
Agnes s glare.  Mary tries to ignore it, looking to her 
friends; catches the nun s look again.  Eyes fixed on Mary 
with an actual GRIMACE. Fed up, Mary makes a choice -- stares 
her right back down, knock it off, bitch, when Sr. Agnes 
leans forward slightly.  The nun stares in shock as --

BLOOD trickles from the nun s nose, collecting in her palm.  
Another stream from her ear... SHOUTS penetrate the din as 
people react, blood coming now from every orifice, streaming 
down her face.  It s awful --

-- but the OLDER NUNS, those in charge, run to Mary.

ON MARY - terrified by the bloodied Sr. Agnes. Shocked when 
the nuns yank Mary away from the table, sending Mary s 
untouched meal CRASHING out of reach.  Pulling Mary out of 
the room protectively as she stares at Sr. Agnes who crumples 
to the floor, victim of a horrific death by poison.   

HEAR - the rising SOUND OF POUNDING HOOVES --


TIGHT ON MARY - hurrying down a corridor.  Now flanked by 
formally dressed guards, rushed along for her safety.

MARY
I don t understand, what s happening? 

A senior nun, the ABBESS, keeps pace but the guard answers:

KINGSGUARD #1
You re leaving this place. 

ABBESS
This was an assassination attempt, 
you were nearly poisoned --     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
3.

MARY
But who --

ABBESS
Someone with ties to the Protestant 
throne of England, no doubt -- 

KINGSGUARD #1
They ll be found and dealt with. 

ANOTHER ANGLE - ROUNDING A CORNER - still rushing -- 

MARY
...poor Sister Agnes, I didn t know --

ABBESS
That she was your taster. 
(then)
Every meal you ve eaten has been 
tested for poison since you left your 
mother s breast. Mary, you are the 
Queen of Scotland.

We stay in MARY S POV as we SLAM through the doorway into 
GLARING DAYLIGHT --


FRANCIS II, 15, and heir to the French throne, lopes toward a 
meeting.  Handsome, thoughtful, dishevelled, late.  

He rounds a corner, finds his half-brother, SEBASTIAN, 17, 
gorgeous with an edgy charm born of being a King s bastard, 
waiting outside the Queen s chambers.  (Other guards standing 
post.)  The brothers greet with wry smiles.  Faux-formal:

FRANCIS
Sebastian.

BASH
Francis.  They were looking for you 
everywhere.  

Bash pointedly eyes Francis s untucked shirt-tail, amused.  

FRANCIS
Shut up.  I was riding.

BASH
Really.  Who?

Francis gives Bash a friendly shove.  It s playful and 
bonding and Bash takes it as such.  Francis eyes the door:

FRANCIS
So Bash, how s the mood? 

BASH
Our father s or the mood in general?  
Tense, to both.  Planning for your 
sister Elisabeth s wedding.  

FRANCIS
Is your mother in there?      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
6.

BASH
Only royals and their attendants 
allowed.  But your mother s in fine 
form. God save you. 
(starts to go)
I m off now that they ve found you --

FRANCIS
Lucky bastard.

Francis jokes without malice, but as he pushes into his 
father s chambers, we stay on Bash.  The reference stings.


NOSTRADAMUS, 40 s, the Queen s Wizard Prophet, shows her a 
sick-smelling grey-green paste.  As Catherine gets a whiff --

QUEEN CATHERINE
...That s disgusting.

NOSTRADAMUS
Where she puts it, he won t smell it.  
Unless he s a very good husband. You 
do want Elisabeth to bear sons?

QUEEN CATHERINE
(bitter on this topic)
As soon as possible, or what is a 
wife s value?  But what about my son, 
Francis? What do your visions tell 
you about his future?  What have you 
seen?

NOSTRADAMUS
There are images forming, but as yet 
they re fleeting and unclear.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

NOSTRADAMUS (CONT D)
Maybe if you were more specific about 
your concerns...

QUEEN CATHERINE
What does Mary s return mean?

NOSTRADAMUS
Are you worried the alliance weakens 
France?

QUEEN CATHERINE
(fuck France)
Let Henry worry about France.  
(this is personal)
Will my son love her?  Will she love 
him? How do I control a daughter-in-
law who is queen in her own right? 

NOSTRADAMUS
Is that what bothers you, her power, 
or the fact that she s young and 
pretty?  Is there anyone you want 
your son to marry?

QUEEN CATHERINE
I d prefer you conjure my son s heirs 
out of a cauldron. But as that can t 
be done, I d settle for someone I 
could influence.  Because if my 
husband hates me, and my son, the 
future king, falls under his wife s 
sway, where does that leave me? 

NOSTRADAMUS
Vulnerable.  You don t need my magic 
to tell you that.  I say this with 
loyalty to you. 

QUEEN CATHERINE
(warns, mocking)
I ve just had a vision... I see you, 
beheaded, at my command. Said with 
gratitude for the secrets we share. 

NOSTRADAMUS
Perhaps a softer approach with the 
young queen would serve your ends.  
Avoid talk of executions in favor of 
motherly advice. 
(as she seethes)
Be patient, answers will come.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

We re CLOSE ON a young prince, HANK, 7, rolling a marble down 
the floor, out of frame.  Sits criss-cross, chatting away: 

HANK
...My sister s got Spain, it s a 
country she won in a wedding. Bash 
says that s not how it works, but 
Mother says don t listen to him, 
he ll never be King, he ll never 
really be anything.

The marble rolls back to him from his UNSEEN FRIEND as he 
rambles on.  Back and forth the marble goes calmly as:

HANK (CONT D)
You know who I listen to?  You. You 
know more than any of them. 
(for example)
When I told the boy at the stables 
you knew the foal would breech, that 
it would die, he couldn t believe it.

He waits but this time the marble doesn t come back.

HANK (CONT D)
What is it?... Are you angry?

Still no marble.  We angle up the long, empty corridor. 

HANK (CONT D)
Don t go, I didn t tell anyone about 
you, just what you said.  
(still no response)
Talk to me...Please.

Rising, moving anxiously down the corridor.  He s scared of 
this friend... As he rounds a corner into a darkened area and 
finds... No one.  Then reacts as he looks down and sees:

The glass marble s been CRUSHED, nothing but shards and dust.

HANK (CONT D)
I m sorry.  

He doesn t wait long for forgiveness.  Turns, picking up his 
pace until he s running off. REVERSE ANGLE as we:

Look out from the dark recess now, HEARING hooves, the low 
grumble of conversation outside.  A leaded window in sight.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
13.

We re with someone (this is CLARISSA, though we don t reveal 
her fully) moving to the window.  A HAND, pale but dirty, 
fingernails bitten to the quick, rests on the window frame, 
frayed edges on her dirty gown. Looking out to:


HEAR horns announcing the arrival.  A quick series of shots:

King Henry strides away from camera, his back to us, a WOMAN 
who could be the queen (but we ll reveal later is Diane) 
falling in step near him, guards and handmaids following.

In another area, Francis makes his way.  Sees Bash hanging 
around, holding back, and nods for him to come along.


Queen Catherine and Princess Elisabeth lead Mary and her 
friends through the castle; a dozen maids trail, in service. 

QUEEN CATHERINE
...We re thrilled you re back to 
stay, and in time for Elisabeth s 
wedding, too.  

Catherine gently guides Mary away from the pack under:

QUEEN CATHERINE (CONT D)
Her groom, Phillip of Spain, has 
arrived, he s taken the west tower, 
your rooms are in the south...
(gossipy, just to Mary)
What are we going to do about your 
friends clothes?
(a second blow)
At least you ve been locked away in a 
convent. You have an excuse. 

Speaking to the group again: 

QUEEN CATHERINE (CONT D)
This is a busy week, so many visiting 
royals and dignitaries. 
(to Mary, generously)
Word of your arrival has spread.  All 
eyes will be on you. After the bride, 
of course.  Please, get settled... 
(taking her leave)
My lady, Jeannette-Louise will 
prepare you with all you need. 

On our girls -- expectant, excited:


As each girl is shown to her room:

MARY - has the most opulent room of all.  The bed, closets 
and chairs laden with clothes, jewels.  Her DOG settles as 
she puts the small, vaguely creepy DOLL on a table near her 
bed.  Takes in her surroundings.  Nervous but happy.

GREER - finds her closet stocked as well.  Fingers the rich 
fabrics, finding the quality a bit lacking in some areas.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
17.

KENNA - settles in a warm bath.  Reaches for a sponge.  Only 
to have it taken from her.  There are maids in waiting to 
soap her hair, wash her feet... fabulous -- she loves it. 

LOLA - snug in all the trappings, but only focused on a LOVE 
LETTER addressed to her, signed  Colin.   Pining for him. 

AILLIE - is in a new dress, hating the corset being cinched 
around her, hair combed, lips stained a deeper crimson. 

WIDEN on her to reveal we are:


Where all the girls have new hair (striking, some 
preposterously high  Killers  video-ish) and wardrobe 
(FreePeople meets Vivienne Westwood-runway).  They look 
older, wildly gorgeous, amazed by their transformations.

LOLA
I wish Colin could see me, he d ask 
to marry me in a second. I definitely 
look of age now, we all do. 

Aillie wipes her lipstain and powder off with a forearm. 

Mary takes in her reflection, emotions mixed as we PRE-LAP:

QUEEN S EMISSARY (V.0.)
You have returned to the Court of 
Henry II at your own Queen s bidding, 
but you are no longer simply Mary s 
little playmates... 

TIME CUT: 

The Queen s Emissary, Lady Jeannette-Louise, prattles on as 
Bash enters.  Lingers on the sidelines.  The girls stealing 
glances of him under: 

QUEEN S EMISSARY (CONT D)
You must counsel her, prepare her, 
account for her. Take responsibility 
for her as she has for you. For your 
lives and well being... 
(reviews her list)
For the Princess Elisabeth s wedding, 
as with any event, you must review 
and acquaint yourselves, and Mary, 
with the guests. Their titles, 
customs, language.  Who among you is 
fluent in Italian?      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
18.

AILLIE
I suppose I am --  

QUEEN S EMISSARY
You ll sit next to the Pope s cousin. 

Making his presence known.  To the emissary: 

BASH
The King sent me with a few updates 
and he d like me to report back.  If 
your seating chart can wait. 
(having trumped her)
It s a private matter.  We re fine on 
our own. I ll behave, I swear. 

She doesn t like it but starts out.  To the servants:

BASH (CONT D)
By on our own I meant on our own.  
Thank you. 

A look from the emissary and the servants exit too, as: 

BASH (CONT D)
Ladies, your Grace. I m Sebastian -- 
Bash -- I remember you though I doubt 
you remember me. From years ago, back 
when I kept a lower profile. 

MARY
And here you are now. In our private 
chambers.  Is that proper?

BASH
If the King says so. There, message 
one, delivered. 

He clocks Mary s amusement; likes it. Presses on:

BASH (CONT D)
Message two, also related to 
hierarchy -- and forgive me for being 
blunt, but as someone born with 
technically no standing, I get to say 
things no one else wants to -- watch 
what you say around your servants. 
While they might come to know you 
intimately, you ll never know them. 

MARY
You speak as if they ve something to 
hide and you know it.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
19.

KENNA
Are there Protestants among them?

BASH
Some, I m sure. Others believe in all 
manner of gods.  The moon, the sun, a 
wide variety of beasts --

GREER
You mean Druids and Pagans -- 

LOLA
There was talk in the village of 
secret altars, blood rituals --

KENNA
-- or some thing that lives in the 
woods that requires human sacrifice.  

AILLIE
Are you saying we re in danger? 

BASH
Are you human? 
(then, grinning)
Don t look so scared.  Peasants tell 
tales to keep each other out of the 
woods. To cut the competition for the 
best hunting.  Or poaching. 

AILLIE
What about the girl? The barefoot 
girl who hides her face?  Should we 
be careful of her too? 

Aillie s tone more wary, less thrilled by horror stories.  
Mary s surprised, recalling the young convent girl s fears. 

MARY
You ve heard about this?

BASH
Let me guess.  From a servant?

Aillie blushes -- it s true.

BASH (CONT D)
Making friends already.  There s 
plenty to worry about within these 
walls, but that has nothing to do 
with spirits.  Your Grace. 

He exits.  The girls look to each other.  He is so sexy.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
20.

GREER
Okay, I ll say it. If he s been here 
all along, how did we miss him?

KENNA
He was just the king s bastard and we 
were nine.  Why does he have to be so 
utterly un-marriagable? 

GREER
Don t count him out. He obviously has 
the King s favor now. Aside from 
Mary, I bet he gets anything, or 
anyone, he wants.  

A ripple of possibility which leaves Aillie uneasy.

AILLIE
You know what I want?  To explore.  
He banished the servants, we re 
finally alone, who s with me?


Mary, Kenna, Aillie, Lola and Greer explore the castle.

AILLIE
...I want to go to the stables, I m 
dying to go for a ride -- 

KENNA
Let s go to the Small Hall, maybe 
some of those guests have arrived --

GREER
First the kitchen.  I m starving. 

MARY
Go. I ll find you later. There s 
something I want to see. 

Mary peels off her own way as the girls go another. 


A half dozen workers prepare the next meal, shocked when 
Kenna, Lola, Aillie and Greer push through, playful: 

KENNA
Pastries and marzipan to our 
chambers, please --     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
21.

AILLIE
And chocolate, lots of it -- 

Swiping gorgeous pastries and sweets as they go.  Greer 
trailing, grabbing a last powdered confection on her way out.  
The servants, a young, handsome LEITH (17) among them, stare -
- some amused, others annoyed.

The girls have scurried around the corner, all but Greer, who 
tugs at her skirt, caught on some hardware.

GREER
Oh, come on --

Leith s at her side.  Trying to get close enough to free her.

LEITH
Wait, hold on, almost --

His hands are on her as he guides her body to a position 
where he can tug the dress free.  She notices... he s hot. 
They re still close, too close, as he meets her gaze. 

LEITH (CONT D)
You shouldn t have done that.

She s surprised -- is he reprimanding her?  Gives it back:

GREER
Come into the kitchen or let a 
servant put his hands on me?

He gently turns her face so we see the POWDERED SUGAR dusted 
around her full lips.  Firm, concerned, no bullshit: 

LEITH
Eaten food that s un-tasted. Didn t 
you hear what happened to your Queen? 

The poison.  Greer s genuinely unnerved, knows he s right. 

GREER
I ve been away from her for so long. 
I just... I let my guard down. 

LEITH
Well don t.  My lady. 

He turns, goes back to his work. Greer watches him, feeling 
he s both protected and challenged her.  Intrigued.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
22.


Mary moves through the castle as we HEAR - THE LAUGHTER OF 
CHILDREN.  From Mary s POV, it seems she sees: 

Francis and Mary, at AGE 7, racing down the hallway, playing.

OUT OF FLASHBACK - Mary has arrived at a door.  She opens it 
gently (this is a special place to her), goes into:


Some youthful trappings, most dusty, a LARGE bed with a 
roughly stitched FEATHER MATTRESS, doors to some ante-rooms.

Mary moves around the room, warmed by memories, taking in 
some left behind items (a rocking horse, a child s chair), 
when she HEARS something. A muffled SCRAPING.  Mary moves 
toward a closed door, a CREAK underfoot... when the door 
OPENS.  Standing before her is Francis.  His shirt loose, 
smudged, hair dishevelled, hands dirty.  Sexy.  Overlapping: 

FRANCISMARY
Mary -- Francis -- I didn t know -- 

FRANCIS
What are you doing in here?

MARY
I was exploring, and these are my old 
rooms.  Don t you remember --

FRANCIS
(sharper than he means to)
Not anymore, no one comes up here --

MARY
Except you.
(her old chambers...)
That s odd.  Why do you --

Then she sees it.  In the background, a large square stone, 
sharpening instruments, a series of unfinished KNIVES. 

MARY (CONT D)
What is that?  
(off his hesitancy)
Is all this yours?  

His tone softens, because he s embarrassed to be found out in 
this way.  She moves forward, taking it in as:      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
23.

FRANCIS
I make knives, and swords.  At least 
I m trying to learn. 

MARY
(amused, playful)
To be a bladesmith?  Is that a 
requirement for future kings now? 

FRANCIS
When you say it like that, it s 
ridiculous, yes -- 

MARY
I think it s fantastic.  You made all 
these?  Why? 

Her genuine enthusiasm is hard to resist. And then there s 
the fact that she might actually understand...

FRANCIS
...I guess I can t help thinking, a 
man, even a king, should have some 
kind of skill. 

MARY
You ll be a great ruler some day, 
isn t that enough?

FRANCIS
I hope I will be, but... I meant, a 
real skill.  That I didn t inherit -- 
wasn t given to me and can t be taken 
away.  My brother, I mean, my half-
brother, Bash, has many.  He wants to 
learn something, he does it, he wants 
to go somewhere, he goes. They don t 
worry so much about him dying that 
they don t let him live. 

MARY
(realizes)
...Because he ll never be King.
(then, wry)
I can milk a goat and cut peat for 
the fire.  The nuns, you know. 

FRANCIS
Impressive. 

He smiles.  Likes her in spite of himself.  So he tries to 
shift the topic, going back to his swords, adding lightly:     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
24.

FRANCIS (CONT D)
I guess if there were ever some 
uprising that sent my line into 
hiding, I could get by as a 
blacksmith --

She cuts him off -- her support so simple, clear, and real. 

MARY
But I d save you.  

He stares -- no hiding the fact he s blown away by her.  

MARY (CONT D)
We d go to Scotland and rule there.

...Mary just starting to feel overwhelmed by their connection 
when Francis breaks it.  Hardly master of his own fate yet:

FRANCIS
Hard to imagine us going anywhere any 
other way, as we re not even allowed 
to leave the castle unguarded.

Mary raises an eyebrow - indicating otherwise.  But he s 
turned back to his swords and doesn t see it. 


Francis enters to find Natalia waiting for him. She tugs at 
some laces, undoing her clothes.  Young, nervous, determined: 

FRANCIS
Natalia... No.

NATALIA
We ve been so good, for months. I 
don t want to wait any more --

Layers of her clothes dropping.  Seeing his reluctance. 

NATALIA (CONT D)
Is it Mary?  You seemed surprised by 
her beauty.  Taken with her. 

FRANCIS
We re engaged.

NATALIA
And there s nothing you can do about 
that, I know.  But you have time.

She takes his hand.  Puts it somewhere below her waist.

NATALIA (CONT D)
Could you do this for me? 
(adds)
There are ways to be safe, no one has 
to know, this is just us --

He looks her in the eyes -- please understand. 

FRANCIS
That s not how my life is ever going 
to be. Just me and someone else.

NATALIA
Exactly.

Before we know what Francis will do -- 


Mary approaches, upbeat, raps on Francis s door.  A few beats 
before he opens.  Surprised, then more abrupt, unwelcoming:

FRANCIS
Mary.  What is it?

She feels the chill immediately and is thrown by it. 

MARY
I brought you something, to decorate 
your swords.

He ignores the small stones, agates, in her hand.       REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

FRANCIS
Next time, you should be announced.  
My page --

MARY
I don t understand... Why do you 
sound so...

Cold.  Shitty.  Busted.  He hesitates, then:

FRANCIS
You shouldn t be here now. 

MARY
Why?... Are you alone? 
(off his silence)
Are you with someone?

FRANCIS
If you re ever going to be Queen of 
France, you should know something.  
Kings don t answer to their wives.

Mary looks stunned, and pissed, as he closes the door on her.  

Staying with Francis as he holds and we see his bed is still 
made.  No one else here at all.  He used the moment to push 
Mary away purposefully, but he didn t like hurting her. 

In the hallway, Mary turns on her heels and stalks off.

ACT TWO


Mary walks, making her way through the thickening trees.

MARY
Stirling, come, where are you?  
Stirling?  Here, boy...

A FLASH of what looks like her dog dashing between trees.  
Mary follows.  Hearing RUSTLING ahead and going after it. 

ANOTHER POV - watching Mary pass and following at a good 
distance.  Methodical as a hunter tracking its prey.


A SERVANT crosses near Lola s bath as she soaks, eyes closed. 
A WOMAN S HANDS shampoo, then reach out of frame.  A MAN S 
hands in their place.  Warm water poured, massaging her head, 
neck... down further.  Lola sits up with a start.  Sees:

LOLA
Colin!  I don t believe it!

Smiling at her, the room cleared of everyone else. She starts 
out of the tub, then slinks down to cover her nakedness.

LOLA (CONT D)COLIN
Oh no --Oh yes.

He laughs but turns, playfully covers his eyes.  She quickly 
climbs out, grabs something to cover herself, and he s on 
her, clinging to each other with a flurry of words.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

Colin looks unsure but willing.  Off Lola s determination: 


Lola and Colin sit before a seemingly empathetic Queen 
Catherine.  They ve been explaining their situation.

QUEEN CATHERINE
What a grand, romantic gesture. Does 
your Queen know about your guest?

LOLA
I thought she d be at the fitting, 
for finishing touches, but she 
wasn t.  But Mary s met Colin, she

Low standing for a highborn. Catherine likes that.

An idea forming, seeing a pawn in front of her...

QUEEN CATHERINE (CONT D)
I love a success story.  Sit.  Tell 
me all about your people s rise. 

To Lola, reassuring, friendly even in her dismissal:

QUEEN CATHERINE (CONT D)
You need to find Mary and keep her on 
task.  So we can all enjoy the 
wedding together.
(to Colin)
And after a few days, we ll arrange 
comfortable passage home for you. 

Lola smiles at Colin, thrilled, and hurries out as a nervous 
Colin settles in for what will be a life-altering chat. 


A LONG TROUGH, roughly hewn, filled with sand. The girls, 
including Elisabeth and her ladies, bury JEWELS when Aillie 
enters, concerned. Moves to Kenna, Greer and a happy Lola.

LOLA
Colin s staying for the wedding!

Handing a spoon, nods to bowls filled with small jewels:

KENNA
That s great news.  We re on the last 
of the favors. Rubies, emeralds and 
diamonds there, semi-precious stones 
in that bowl. Bury them deep, so the 
guests really have to dig. Make them 
earn them.

Entering with Queen Catherine, finding her husband ensconced 
with his mistress, Diane.  Also Bash, Francis, and Henry s

the details of seating at the church.   
What s this about a girl?

DIANE
We just heard that Mary s missing.

QUEEN CATHERINE 
Have  we ?  Perhaps she didn t know 
to report to my husband s mistress.

HENRY
Catherine.  He said she went into the 
woods. 

Catherine knows: this warrants concern.  To the lower guard: 

QUEEN CATHERINE
You lost a queen, did you? 

LOWER GUARD
I can t say it was her, for sure. 
Those girls run in a pack, they re 
all pretty -- 

The mid-level guard SLASHES the lower s cheek.  The man 
yelps, covers his wound, blood seeping through his fingers...      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

MID-LEVEL GUARD
You ll be anything but if she doesn t 
come back from those woods -- 

Henry holds up a hand, stops the abuse, but adds a warning.

KING HENRY
-- in the same condition she entered 
them.  Bash, take some men --

FRANCIS
I m going too -- 

KING HENRY
Bash knows these dangers.  You stay 
where you re useful. Wherever that 
is. 

Bash feels bad, catches Francis s gaze.  Francis  look is 
hard -- not wanting the favorite-son s pity.


Servants hurry, laying out food and flowers for the feast. 


Mary s gown, shoes and jewelry laid out.  Her servants 
waiting nervously, not sure what to do until her return. 


Mary follows a tiny stream.  Her satin-shoes torn, feet 
bloodied. She s scratched, tired, and dirty when she HEARS:

What sounds like the WHIMPERING OF A DOG up ahead. 


Mary enters cautiously.  A low, canine GROWL seems to come 
from a cluster of rocks in the distance -- the dark entrance 
to a low cave.  She moves closer, CRUNCHING what appear to be 
some small animal BONES underfoot. More bones clustered 
closer to the cave s opening.  

On a rock, a dark stain.  Mary wets her finger, drags it 
across, and we see what now looks like BLOOD on her 
fingertip. From the cave, a distant, muffled whine, like an 
animal in pain. Closer now, uneasy:     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

MARY
Stirling?  Here boy...

Suddenly a MURDER OF CROWS fly out, surrounding Mary.  She 
waves them away as she SCREAMS -- 


Bash on horseback, a half-dozen Kingsguards spread out around 
him.  He hears her DISTANT SCREAM and kicks his horse.


Mary crashes through the low underbrush, running, when 
something bursts through the trees, GRABBING HER.

TIGHT ON MARY - wresting from a tight, high embrace, pushing 
off and tumbling to the ground, bringing her assailant down 
with her.  A tangle of clothes covering them both, Mary using 
all her force, landing a solid punch and some serious kicks, 
her attacker rolling off her with --

BASH
Dear God, would you stop?!

She stares at Bash in shock.  Sees his horse, realizes Bash 
had tried to pull her up onto it.  His hand to his jaw as he 
struggles to get up.  Sees her, skirt hiked, bodice loose...

BASH (CONT D)
Are you trying to kill me?  I m out 
here trying to save you --

MARY
I thought I was being attacked, you 
don t just grab a person, out of 
nowhere -- 

BASH
(equally vehement)
And you don t run away from the 
castle.  Young girls, royals, queens, 
do not leave alone --

MARY
(furious, exhausted rant)
My dog ran away because I was at the 
stream because your brother s a 
moody, arrogant ass, and I got lost 
and scared by these awful birds, and 
my feet hurt, and believe me --

MARY (CONT'D)
-- when I am queen in practice and 
not just name, women will be given 
actual shoes!

Bash takes her in...takes her all in. A wry grin forming:

BASH
You really think my brother s an ass?
(moves closer, playful)
We re half-brothers, nothing in 
common but our father, really.

He stops, smile fading.  He s seen something behind her. 

BASH (CONT D)
...We should go.

Something moving through the trees.  A tense beat as Mary 
senses it too... When what appears is Mary s WOLFHOUND, 
something in his mouth. 

MARY
Stirling, c mere...what is that?  
Drop it.  I said drop it -- 

A DESICCATED FOREARM.  Human. Skin intact, drained of blood.  
Bash yanks her, hard now, over to his horse.  His GUARDS 
appearing now, out of the forest, joining them. 

BASH
We re leaving here, now.  Mary --

Both on his horse now, Mary clings to Bash as they tear off.


END OF ACT TWO     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
35.

ACT THREE


Mary is being readied for the wedding.  A LADY S MAID tugs at 
her hair, her DOG settled nearby, when the door thuds open. 
Lola, Kenna, Greer and Aillie burst in. Almost overlapping:

AILLIE
Thank goodness they found you!  We 
thought you might miss the wedding --

KENNA
Is it true, what they re saying?

AILLIE
That you went into the woods?

KENNA
That Bash rescued you?  What 
happened, what was he like -- 

MARY
He was there, but he didn t rescue 
me. And we hardly spoke, at least, 
once we were surrounded by the King s 
Guards, all the way back.
(unsettled by this)
I saw something awful while I was out 
there.  Stirling found an arm, a 
human arm. 

The servant seems to tense.  Mary notices it as: 

KENNA
In the woods?

GREER
They re full of desperate villagers 
and outlaws, Bash said so.  Robbing 
and hacking each other -- 

AILLIE
(rooting for Francis)
All this talk of Bash. Didn t Francis 
go looking for you?  

KENNA
Shouldn t he have?

MARY
No.  It doesn t matter.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
36.

The girls trade looks, smelling trouble. 

MARY (CONT D)
I don t want to talk about Francis. 
He s... indifferent to me.  

GREER
Mary. You ve only just seen each 
other again. It s going to be fine.

MARY
I don t think so.

KENNA
It will. One way or another.  Look at 
the King...

MARY
The King?  What do you mean? 

KENNA
He s married to the Queen, but they 
say he spends his life with Diane, 
his mistress. It s different for 
royals, once they wed, and you re a 
queen in your own right. 

GREER
(but to Kenna, warning)
Is this really advice you want to be 
giving our Queen?

KENNA
(ignores Greer)
But it s true.  Once you have heirs, 
no one would dare question you. If 
you don t love the man you marry, no 
one can stop you from bringing the 
man you want into your bed.

As this lands on Mary -- 


As Mary opens the door to her quarters, a cluster of ROCKS 
catches, skitters across the floor.  She recognizes them. 
They re the agates she collected in the riverbed.

MARY
Hello?

Silence. Nothing seems disturbed, except the TALISMAN/DOLL 
she keeps near her bed, is gone.  RUSTLING across the room.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
37.

MARY (CONT D)
Who s here?

No answer, but someone is here.  Mary sees a shadowed 
silhouette, an unclear shape, behind a dressing screen.

NEW ANGLE (NOT MARY S POV) - REVEALS a fleeting glimpse of -- 
SOMEONE/CLARISSA.  A distorted REFLECTION in a thick, leaded 
glass window: a misshapen, rough burlap sack covering a head, 
charcoal smudges for eyes, one of which has a slit cut out of 
it and through which a single, milky eye darts. 

BACK ON MARY, oblivious to what lurks there, approaching the 
screen, reaching out a hand.  From the opposite side of the 
screen another, delicate hand touches hers.  Mary GASPS, but 
holds steady.  Doesn t pull away.

MARY (CONT D)
Who are you?

CLARISSA
(raspy whisper, warning)
Don t drink the wine.

Just then, a GUST OF WIND across the room -- a cup clatters 
to the ground.  When Mary turns back, the SHROUDED FIGURE is 
gone.  Mary steps behind the screen.  Nobody there.  But a 
door s been left ajar.  A door Mary never noticed before.  
When she shuts it, she sees why.  The door is cleverly 
concealed as part of the painted mural covering the wall.

Mary pulls it open, finds a drafty, dank passageway winding 
darkly into the bowels of the castle.  A secret corridor.  
She quickly closes the door -- moves a piece of furniture in 
front of it.  Then another.


A spectacular ballroom.  MUSICIANS play.  CAMERA SNAKES 
through the opulent, festive hall, PUSHING through a group of 
COURTIERS who ve gathered to watch the BRIDE AND GROOM 
(Elisabeth and Philip) dance a stately version of La Volta.  
CAMERA PANS the onlookers, LANDING ON Lola, searching for 
Colin.  When she spots him, he looks tense. Distracted as he 
scans the crowd, spots MARY across the room.  He grabs a cup 
of wine from a passing tray and downs it.  

On Lola again as Greer approaches her.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
38.

GREER
Why aren t you dancing with Colin?

LOLA
I wanted to...

ANGLE COLIN as he interrupts Mary s conversation with AILLIE 
and a couple ND COURTIERS, bows unsteadily and kisses Mary s 
coronation ring.  She politely acknowledges him, promptly 
returns her attention to the others.  

GREER
What s he doing with Mary? 

REVERSE ANGLE - Lola watching.  

LOLA
She s his queen.  He s just paying 
his respects.

But there s a flicker of jealousy on her face.

BACK WITH MARY AND COLIN.  He interrupts again, nervously 
hands her a cup of wine.

COLIN
Raise a glass to the happy couple.

Mary takes the wine, raises it to her lips, then stops -- 

MARY
(sotto, to herself)
Don t drink the wine.

She hesitates, wondering if she s being silly.  But when 
Colin turns away, she sets the cup down on a nearby table.  
Almost simultaneously, a hand reaches for her waist -- 
Colin s pulling her onto the dance floor. 

REVERSE ANGLE - Aillie reaches for the cup Mary set down.  
Mary moves to stop her, but Colin s leading her into a 
formation dance, and Aillie s already drunk the wine.  As she 
dances, Mary keeps an eye on Aillie, who seems fine.

Mary s familiar with the choreography of the dance, but 
Colin s feeling the effects of the wine.  He stumbles, 
raising eyebrows among the courtiers.

REVERSE ANGLE - Lola still watching, hurt.  Now with both 
Greer and Kenna by her side.  They re mortified for her.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
39.

LOLA
He s making a fool of himself.  And 
of me.

Kenna thinks fast, moves toward the musicians.

ON MARY AND COLIN - Mary tries to steer him out of the dance, 
but he resists.  Then, our MUSIC SHIFTS, as a CONTEMPORARY 
SOUNDTRACK SWELLS.  THE FORMATION DANCE GIVES WAY TO A 
ROUSING CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE (similar to modern Ska-core 
dancing).   

Greer and Kenna pull Lola onto the dance floor.  Mary, Aillie 
and Colin join in.  This dance is in their blood.  They make 
a compelling, attractive sight.  

IN ANOTHER CORNER - King Henry, Diane and Queen Catherine 
turn to watch as the young Scots take over the ball.  Henry 
enjoys the spectacle a little too much, which irritates both 
Catherine and Diane.

CATHERINE
We are overrun by Scots.

NEW ANGLE - Bash watches Mary dance, drawn to her unbridled 
energy and passion.  Somehow, Mary senses his gaze and finds 
him in the crowd.  THEIR EYES LOCK, as the movement slows.  
For a moment, they re the only two people in the room, an 
unspoken bond forming between them.  Just then, FEATHERS FALL 
LIKE SNOW FROM THE CEILING onto the guests in the hall.

ON MARY - turning her face upward, registering the feathers.  
And, as a plume brushes her cheek, she s thrown into a 
FLASHBACK:


The sound of CHILDREN S LAUGHTER.  Excited shrieking.  YOUNG 
MARY and YOUNG FRANCIS (both about 7) hold hands as they jump 
up and down on a bed topped with a feather mattress.  With a 
LOUD RIP, the mattress tears open, sending DOWN FEATHERS 
FLYING INTO THE AIR.  More laughter, shrieking and jumping.  

FRANCIS
Mary, look!  Feather-snow!

The children jump, grabbing at the floating feathers.


Mary senses it now -- Francis eyes are also on her.  The 
feathers seem to have registered a memory for him too. 
Natalia, at his side, forgotten, as his gaze locks on Mary s.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
40.

They begin walking toward each other, but before they 
connect, a slight commotion erupts in the hall as Elisabeth 
and Philip are ushered out and Lola, Greer, Kenna and Aillie 
descend on Mary, yanking her aside.

LOLA
(re: bride and groom)
Look.  Elisabeth and Philip are 
leaving.

AILLIE
Where are they going?

The other girls exchange a knowing glance, then Kenna moves 
to follow the bride and groom out of the hall.  The other 
girls follow into --


They talk as they walk down the corridor.

KENNA
They re taking Philip and Elisabeth 
to the nuptial bed chamber.
(off Aillie s blank stare)
For the consummation of their 
marriage.

Aillie s shocked.

AILLIE
Now?  Right now?

GREER
Yes, right now.  The official 
witnesses have been called away from 
the ball as well.

AILLIE
So where are we going?  We re not 
official witnesses.

Kenna leads them into --


A small room with what looks like a shuttered window set into 
an interior wall.  Kenna puts her finger to her lips, quiet.

Kenna slides the window shutter open, revealing an ornately 
carved screen, much like a confessional screen -- through 
which, the girls can see directly into --     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
41.


The bed chamber is a sea of candles, the centerpiece of which 
is an ornate, canopied bed. SEVERAL LADY S MAIDS scurry back 
and forth, removing Elisabeth s wedding gown, pulling a 
nightdress over her head, brushing her hair, rubbing perfumed 
oils on her skin.  A BLACK-ROBED BISHOP, trailed by a YOUNG 
PRIEST, mumbles a Latin incantation, sprinkles holy water 
onto the bed.  Three or four FRENCH & SPANISH OFFICIAL 
WITNESSES (all male, all noble) mill about.  For such an 
intimate setting, there s a lot of activity in the room.

INTERCUTTING WITH - THE GIRLS - watching but unnoticed.  In 
hushed voices:

LOLA
She s beautiful.

KENNA
Where s Philip?

MARY
I didn t realize it took so many 
people to consummate a marriage.

GREER
Only the important ones.

This registers, uncomfortably, with Mary.

BACK ON ELISABETH as a hush comes over the room when Philip 
and his STEWARD enter.  Elisabeth s maids retreat to the back 
of the room, where they remain.  Elisabeth curtseys, but 
looks forlorn as she stares at the bed.  A child, suddenly 
terrified.  Philip crosses to her, brushes a stray hair from 
her face.  Takes in his beautiful bride.

PHILIP
I am the luckiest man in France.

Elisabeth smiles.  Philip leans forward and they kiss.  
Gently at first, then harder.  But Elisabeth resists, 
uncomfortable with the rather substantial audience still 
present in the room.  Sensing this, Philip picks her up, 
carries her to the bed, positions himself over her.

PHILIP (CONT D)
We are the only ones who matter here.  
You, me.  You.

Softly, he kisses her neck as he pulls up her nightdress, 
slips a hand in.  Elisabeth s eyes open.  She gasps.  Her 
hand grips the sheets...      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
42.

ANGLE THE GIRLS -- all rapt, stunned by what they re seeing.  
This isn t what any of them expected.  In addition to being 
shocked, Aillie looks uncomfortable and unwell/drowsy, though 
her friends are too distracted to notice.

AILLIE
Let s go.

But the other girls aren t about to leave.  Aillie slips out, 
as the others watch PHILIP AND ELISABETH MAKE LOVE, Elisabeth 
now a full, eager participant, because he is good at this...

SMASH CUT TO:


Mary, Lola, Kenna and Greer tumble out into the corridor, 
drunk with newfound sexual knowledge.

MARY
(hushed)
Go, before anyone sees us.

QUICK POPS of each girl scurrying down a different corridor:

KENNA, flushed and smiling, passes a cluster of SPANISH 
COURTIERS who eye her lustily.  She rounds a corner, stumbles 
into a deserted nook, steadies herself against a wall... then 
gives in to an impulse and runs a hand under her dress, 
touching herself.  She enjoys it, doesn t stop.

LOLA approaches a MAN from behind, reaches out for him.

LOLA
Colin.

The MAN turns around.  Not Colin.  She curtseys quickly and 
moves on, continuing her search.

GREER angles down a corridor that opens into the kitchen.  
She spots the handsome servant, LEITH, going about his 
business, heads toward him.

BACK WITH KENNA - aroused to the point of no return when -- 
suddenly, a STRANGER approaches from behind, wraps his arms 
around her waist, presses his body into her as he kisses her 
neck.  Kenna s surprised, but pleased, as she allows herself 
to melt into him --  


WITH GREER, aroused, angling toward Leith.  He s measured.  
Gauging his response to her desire and recklessness.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
43.

LEITH
...You and your friends, you snuck 
into the consummation?

GREER
It was exciting. 

LEITH
I see that.

GREER
You remind me of Philip.  The groom.

LEITH
But I m not, I m not anyone.  I m a 
servant.  You shouldn t be here. You 
girls think the rules of the castle, 
of court, of station, are a game?

Trying to bridge the gap; feeling different than the others:

GREER
I m not highborn like my friends.

LEITH
Then you ll be the first to lose.  
Don t make me the cause of it. 

Greer hesitates, moved, hurt, knowing he s right.  And goes. 
But as she exits she steals a glance back, both wanting more. 


BACK WITH KENNA AND THE STRANGER, as she turns to face him, 
only to discover she s in KING HENRY S EMBRACE.  

KENNA
Your Grace.

A split second of indecision for Kenna, before she gives in 
to the passion of the moment.


The feast is winding down.  Mary sees Francis amongst other 
scattered wedding guests.  Catches his eye purposefully.  He 
crosses to her, something on his mind, too -- Natalia 
watching as they round a corner out of sight...


Facing off, both wanting to be heard, almost overlapping:      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
44.

FRANCIS
I ve been wanting to talk to you --

MARY
There s something I need to say to 
you.

FRANCIS
When you came to my room, I acted, I 
shouldn t have... There were other 
ways to handle this, without putting 
you in danger -- 

He struggles, feeling bad but not ready for full disclosure.

FRANCIS (CONT D)
You should stay out of those woods.  

MARY
(pissed)
You think I ran off because of you?  
I lost my dog.  
(emotional but forceful)
And yes, you upset me, you were rude 
and cruel, and I don t understand 
why.  We re supposed to get married 
someday, you do know that --

FRANCIS
Believe me, I know --

MARY
I don t expect you to love me on 
sight, I don t even know if I like 
you, but don t we owe it to each 
other, to our families, to our 
countries, to give it a chance? 

FRANCIS
It s not that simple --

MARY
What s not that simple?  We ve been 
engaged since we were six, it s all 
planned, how awful do you have to 
find me to act this way --

He can t stand for Mary to think he doesn t like or want her.  
The damn bursts, his passion for his country pouring forth:     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
45.

FRANCIS
(blurts)
It s not you, you re pretty and smart 
and... unpredictable, but that 
doesn t matter.  What matters is 
what s right for my country. France 
isn t as strong as you think, or 
care, which maybe you don t, but I 
do. I m going to be King someday, 
responsible for my people and right 
now, I think an alliance with 
Scotland against a formidable enemy 
will bleed my country dry. 

MARY
(holy shit)
...You don t want to marry me.  You 
don t want this at all --

FRANCIS
Things could change.  
(spilling out options)
If England comes after us, we will 
need Scotland. If Italy stops funding 
the realm, we won t need Italy. I 
need to know these things before I 
make a decision.

MARY
The decision isn t yours, it s your 
father s --

FRANCIS
You don t see him pushing a wedding 
either, do you?  All engagements 
really do is hold alliances.  He s 
betting we might need Scotland, I m 
betting we ll get more support 
elsewhere.  I know that s not what 
you want to hear -- 

It s all crashing in on her now.  Making terrible sense:

MARY
But you won t love me.  You won t let 
yourself --

FRANCIS
I can t let myself, not right now.  
And I don t want to lead you on.  All 
I m asking you to do is wait.  See 
how things go --     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
46.

MARY
See how things go for France.  I 
guess it is simple, after all... 
(steely)
But you re not the only one with a 
country to think of.

Mary turns and storms off.  Her eyes might be glassy with 
tears but her expression is fierce, determined. 


Mary s asleep in her bed, small and alone.  Until -- we hear 
movement on the bed.  WIDEN TO REVEAL - COLIN pulling back 
the covers, pulling up Mary s nightdress.  He s on top of 
her, moving frantically, as fast as he can. 

Mary jerks awake.  Reflexively pushing him off. Colin seems 
shocked by her quick response, by the very fact that she 
awakened.  Stares at her in horrified disbelief.  In an 
instant, Mary s out of his grasp.  Already calling for help.

MARY
No, no!  Guard! Help me --  

Colin moves to silence her, but it s too late.  Doors thud 
open, GUARDS burst in, quickly secure Colin.  As they drag 
him from her chamber:

COLIN
Please, Your Grace, please!  It s not 
what you think.

Off Mary, shaken and confused --

ACT FOUR


Lola, Kenna, Greer and Aillie walk hurriedly down a winding 
corridor.

AILLIE
What are we supposed to say to her 
when we see her?

GREER
We comfort her.

KENNA
What if she s not a virgin?

GREER
She ll have to be examined.  If she s 
not, then she ll never be Queen of

not, she s done.

You must remain loyal to Mary, not 
Colin.

Aillie hangs back with Lola, who s obviously distraught.

LOLA (CONT D)
What if Mary did invite him to her 
chamber?  How could he have refused?  
(then)
I need to know.

KENNA
You can t ask Mary.

LOLA
I have to talk to Colin.

AILLIE
How?  He s locked in a cell.

Off Lola, determined to find a way --


Lola, wearing a hooded cloak that obscures her face, carries 
a torch to light her way as she navigates a dark, damp 
passageway that seems to wind deeper and deeper into the 
bowels of the castle.  As she rounds a corner, she comes face-
to-face with a large and imposing GUARD who protects a 
heavily fortified door.

Lola opens her hand, reveals a JEWELED BROOCH.  The Guard 
pockets the brooch, opens the door to let her pass.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

A dank cell.  Beaten, bloodied and terrified, Colin faces 
Lola with difficulty.  Still, he wants her to know: 

COLIN
...I love my family, my queen and my 
country.  More than anything, I love 
you.

LOLA
Did Mary ask you to come to her 
chamber?  Is that why you were there?

COLIN
Please don t ask questions.

LOLA
Tell me and I ll appeal to Mary s 
sense of justice.

COLIN
There are people, powerful people, 
whose eyes and ears are everywhere.  
They are the ones who forced me into 
these circumstances.  The last thing 
they want is justice.

LOLA
What are you talking about?

COLIN
Leave me here.  Forget me.

Lola s frustration gives way to tears.

LOLA
Colin, no.  If you don t confide in 
me, they will execute you.

Colin looks at her lovingly, but determined.  With sadness:

COLIN
I know.


Lola appeals to Mary, clasping her hand.

Please, my lady. My friend. You re 
the only one who can save Colin.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

Mary s torn, filled with compassion for Lola, but still 
shaken and confused by her encounter with Colin.

MARY
Lola --

LOLA
They ll kill him for this -- they ll 
kill him before the day is out.

MARY
He attacked me --

He swears his loyalty to you and to 
Scotland.  And he swears his love for 
me.  

MARY
You spoke to him --

LOLA
I had to.  But he won t tell me the 
truth of what happened.
(then)
Will you?  Did you ask him to come to 
you?

Shocked, Mary distances herself from Lola. For the first 
time, we see Mary own every inch of her title.  She is regal 
and her indignation is righteous.

MARY
You re defending the man who 
committed an assault against your 
Queen.  Lola --

Forgive me, Your Grace.  I m only 
trying to make sense of why he s so 
afraid.

MARY
He was caught and now he s afraid to 
die.

LOLA
It s more than that.  I think he s 
been threatened in some way. 
(off Mary)

LOLA (CONT'D)
I know it doesn t make sense, but I 
believe he was forced into committing 
this crime.  
(pressing on)
Why else would he do this?  How could 
he hope to get away with it? 

Lola has a point.  In QUICK POPS Mary recalls:

FLASH: Colin s stunned expression when he sees Mary is awake.

FLASH: The silhouetted figure behind the screen.

CLARISSA 
(urgently; a warning)
Don t drink the wine.

FLASH: MARY S POV of Aillie drinking from Mary s wine cup at 
the wedding.  A theory forming in her mind... 

MARY
Someone warned me...

LOLA
Warned you about what?

Mary blows past her question, responds with one of her own.

MARY
How was Aillie last night?

LOLA
Drunk.  Her maids had to carry her to 
bed.  

MARY
What about today?

LOLA
Groggy, but fine.  What difference 
does it make?

MARY
How did he hope to get away with it 
unless... He didn t think I d wake.
(means)
Someone else knew of his plan... and 
if it was a plan, others might be 
involved. I have to talk to him.

LOLA
You can only do that if he s alive.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

MARY
I have to delay Colin s execution.
(a plan taking shape)
Is there talk?  Do others believe I 
invited Colin to my chamber?
(off Lola, softening)
Tell me the truth, Lola.

LOLA
Yes, my lady.  Some do.

Off Mary, eyes blazing --


CLOSE ON MARY as she makes a deliberate, and entirely false, 
confession.

MARY
... The truth is, I drank too much 
wine last night and I -- invited 
Colin to my room. 

WIDEN TO REVEAL - her shocked listeners, King Henry and Queen 
Catherine.

CATHERINE
What is this nonsense, child?

MARY
(undeterred)
Nothing happened, and I ll submit to 
any examination Your Majesty deems 
necessary to prove it. 
(then)
Things moved quickly and I -- 
overreacted. But Colin doesn t 
deserve to be executed.

Henry stands up.

HENRY
Enough.  Your loyalty, whether it s 
to your lady-in-waiting or your 
countryman, is admirable.  However, 
it s also misplaced.

MARY
What do you mean?

CATHERINE
Witnesses have come forward.       REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
53.

HENRY
Colin MacPhail was part of an English 
plot to ruin your reputation.  To 
undo your engagement to Francis and 
destroy the alliance between Scotland 
and France.

CATHERINE
The boy is guilty of treason.

Mary s thrown by this, but stands her ground, formidable.

MARY
All the more cause for me to hear 
from him. 
(off Henry)
I am not a French subject, and I am 
not a pawn. I am the Queen of 
Scotland. If my person is in danger, 
I will assess the threat, and the 
crime. 

A glint of respect from Henry.

HENRY
Scotland is fortunate to have such a 
fierce ruler.  

Catherine disapproves, interjects.

CATHERINE
It s a waste of time.

HENRY
It s settled.  The Scotsman will be 
heard.  Tomorrow.  By everyone in 
this room, as well as my privy 
council.

Off Catherine, unhappy --


Dimly lit even during the day.  Colin and two other PRISONERS 
share the dank, putrid cell.  The other prisoners huddle 
conspiratorially together, then approach a terrified Colin.

PRISONER #1
How would you like to breathe fresh 
air and feel the sun on your skin?
(off Colin)
All you have to do is help us disarm 
the Guard when he comes.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
54.

COLIN
I can t --

PRISONER #2 
It s just one guard. We ve bribed the 
rest and there s someone meeting us 
with horses in the woods.

Colin s frightened.  He s in way over his head.

PRISONER #1
You have two choices, boy.  Stay here 
and die or come with us and live.

Just then, the clang of a key in the lock.  

PRISONER #1 (CONT D)
Will you come?

Terrified, Colin nods.  What happens next happens fast.  

The GUARD enters, heads straight for Prisoner #1, PLUNGES A 
DAGGER INTO HIS CHEST.  This was a set-up.  Prisoner #2 grabs 
Colin.  They run --


As soon as they round a corner, and in one swift motion, 
Prisoner #2 SNAPS COLIN S NECK, walks calmly away.  He s 
joined by the GUARD who stabbed Prisoner #1.  

Off Colin, slumped on the cold ground, dead eyes staring up --

FADE OUT:

ACT FIVE


Lola s eyes are red-rimmed with grief.  She s drained, numb.  
Mary is subdued and compassionate.

LOLA
He wasn t a traitor.  He wasn t a 
rapist.

MARY
I know he loved you, and I believe he 
was coerced.

LOLA
By whom?

MARY
I don t know.  King Henry believes it 
was an English plot.  But it could be 
anyone -- anyone who objects to my 
marriage to Francis.

LOLA
Your enemies are everywhere.

It s a simple, terrifying truth, and it settles on them both.

MARY
I am so sorry, Lola.

Mary moves to comfort, but Lola pulls away.

LOLA
You re the reason he s dead.  Anyone 
who s close to you lives in constant 
danger.  We re disposable.  Kenna, 
Greer, Aillie, me -- all of us.

MARY
No, you re not.  I need you.  You re 
my friends.

LOLA
Kenna s my friend.  Greer and Aillie 
are my friends.  You are my Queen and 
I am your subject.  I m here in 
service to you, whatever that means.  
Whatever it costs me.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
56.

Mary feels the weight of a seemingly unbearable 
responsibility on her shoulders, and realizes this burden is 
hers alone to bear.

MARY
I ll protect you.

LOLA
You can t even protect yourself.

MARY
I ll do better, Lola.  I promise.


On Francis, as he faces off with Mary, trying to understand:

FRANCIS
...Did you invite this boy to your 
room?  My father thinks you were 
lying, that you were trying to 
protect one of your countrymen --

MARY
(feels awful and angry)
I didn t protect him, did I?  He s 
dead.  Why do you care how he came to 
my room? 

FRANCIS
How do you think this makes you look?

MARY
Or how it makes you look.  Because 
we re engaged. But you have no 
intention of marrying me.  What if I 
told everyone that? Then this would 
be over -- 

FRANCIS
You wouldn t do that, because it s 
not true.  I might marry you --

MARY
(hates these words)
Someday.  Maybe.  If.  

FRANCIS
You said you had a country to think 
about.  Were you thinking about 
Scotland during any of this?      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
57.

MARY
(impassioned, constrained)
I was thinking, for a minute, about 
myself, my friends, my safety --

He feels for her.  Facing the same obligations he does. 

FRANCIS
You could have ruined your 
reputation.  Forcing the issue so 
that I couldn t marry you, even if 
things go the way we want them to -- 

Stops himself. He hadn t wanted to lead her on and this does.

MARY
Did you say we? ...So, we would want 
to be married? 
(he looks caught)
Don t worry.  You re not leading me 
on.  I know how you feel...

And she does.  He s into her.  There are obstacles, but she 
has hope. For them, for Scotland, for more. As he walks away, 
pissed at himself, Mary adds, almost to herself -- 

MARY (CONT D)
I know how you feel. 


A determined Francis blows down the corridor, stopping before 
a door.  He hesitates only a moment before pushing into --


Natalia s surprised to see him.  She nods to her LADIES, who 
scurry out of the room.  

NATALIA
What are you doing here?

Francis heads straight for Natalia, leads her into --


-- where he stops short at the bed.  Faces her.

FRANCIS
If we do this, you have to be willing 
to marry someone else.  Especially if 
we do this and you re with child...     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
58.

She goes into his arms, a whisper in his ear: 

NATALIA
I ll do whatever you ask.  But I ll 
always belong to you.

Off the young couple, giving in to their passion --


Catherine lights into Nostradamus.  She s furious.

CATHERINE
You said the potion would make her 
sleep like the dead.  If it had, 
she d have failed the examination and 
the engagement to Francis would ve 
been broken.

NOSTRADAMUS
There was nothing wrong with my 
potion.  It was the delivery of it 
that failed.

CATHERINE
That stupid boy.  

NOSTRADAMUS
Stupid, dead boy.  Throwing away his 
life to protect his family.  From 
you. 

CATHERINE
I ll do anything for my family, for 
my son. As to the Scot s death, Henry 
gave me no choice.  The boy would ve 
implicated me.  And you.

NOSTRADAMUS
Henry suspects nothing?

Catherine shakes her head, no.

NOSTRADAMUS (CONT D)
And yet, the Queen of Scotland is 
still a virgin and her betrothal to 
Francis still stands.

The reality of this gnaws at Catherine.

CATHERINE
Have your visions altered?     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
59.

NOSTRADAMUS
They remain constant.  She will bring 
his death.

CATHERINE
Then I cannot relent.

NOSTRADAMUS
Not if you truly wish to save your 
son, and yourself. 
(then)
You must be willing to sacrifice.


Mary s MAIDS undress her, take her hair down, etc...  Her 
gaze is drawn to the bedside table where she clocks -- the 
STICK DOLL.  It s been returned, but altered.  The doll s 
head has been wrapped in a dull, rough yarn resembling a worn 
burlap sack, with two dark smudges for eyes.  She moves to 
the table, picks it up. 

Off Mary, examining the doll, wondering what it all means --

FADE OUT.
