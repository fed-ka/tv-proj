The PARTY is in full swing, the interior of the gorgeous 
mansion even more impressive than it looked from outside.  We 
drift through the DRESSED UP CROWD, picking up on the small 
town gossip as we go, stopping to listen here or there to the 
revelers whisper about the guests of honor... 

WHISPERING PARTY GUEST 1
They ve only been dating, what?  
Three months?!  

WHISPERING PARTY GUEST 2
Guess she d already been with every 
other man in town, might as well 
get married.

WHISPERING PARTY GUEST 3
Yeah, to the richest, most eligible 
bachelor in North Hampton, before 
any of us even got a crack at him!3.



WHISPERING PARTY GUEST 4
And she walks around like she s 
such hot stuff, but she s not even 
that hot.  I don t get the appeal.  
Honey stop staring-

We see a MAN practically DROOLING WITH LUST while his WIFE 
over... drooling he s who see we then And  pissed. watches,

FREYA BEAUCHAMP, 20s -- curvy, buxom, big-boobed, unapologetic 
wild-haired sex goddess.  (If Christina Hendricks and Angelina 
Jolie had a baby, Freya would still be hotter.)  She walks 
right up to the handsome, commanding DASH GARDINER, 30. She 
gives him a sultry, passionate, bedroom-style kiss.  He grins.

DASH
What was that for?

FREYA
That was for everyone at this party 
who hates me right now, because I m 
marrying you... 

DASH
How could anyone hate someone as 
wonderful as you?!

FREYA
Oh my dear Dashy.  You haven t been 
in this town very long...

 MOTHER, his by approached They rePENELOPE GARDINER, 50s, 
elegant, sour, vain.  She kisses Dash on both cheeks.  

DASH
Mother, where have you been?  Your 
cheeks are ice cold-

Penelope shrugs, touching her cheek self-consciously, clearly 
hiding something.  She looks at Freya, disapproving.

PENELOPE
So, Dash tells me you re planning 
to... make your own wedding dress.

FREYA
My mother is.  She s an amazing 
seamstress.  Vera Wang s got 
her! on nothin 4.



PENELOPE
Well it s a shame I can t just give 
you the dress I married Dashiell s 
father in.  I always wanted to pass 
it down, it s just perfect, but you 
know, it would really be just...

FREYA
-Yes, you mentioned-

PENELOPE
-Just way too small-

FREYA
-As you ve said.  Many, many times.

DASH
I for one think Freya would look 
breathtaking even if she walked 
down the aisle in a potato sack.

Penelope gives a tight smile, grabs an hors d'oeuvre from a 
PASSING WAITER.

PENELOPE
Well I should stay away from these 
shrimp puffs if I wanna stay a size 
two!  Ha ha.

FREYA
(under her breath)
Or you could just choke on it.

SUDDENLY, PENELOPE CHOKES!  BREATHE! CAN T SHE  SHE FLAILS 
HELPLESSLY!  FREYA'S EYES WIDEN, WONDERING -- DID I DO THAT??  
Dash gives Penelope the Heimlich, the shrimp puff goes 
flying, Penelope breathes heavily, relieved.  

DASH
Mother, are you okay?

PENELOPE
fine. I m fine I m

She waves him off her, as Freya slips away, freaked out.


A hand slathers some cheese onto a piece of bread, and then 
stuffs the bread self-consciously into a mouth.  The hand and 
the mouth belong to INGRID: 30, underdressed, underconfident, 
undersexed, but endearing.  Freya approaches Ingrid, freaking-5.



FREYA
Holy crap!  Something crazy just 
happened: I wished for Dash s mom 
to choke, and... she choked!  It 
was like I willed it!  With my 
mind!  Like Drew Barrymore in 
Firestarter, only -- with shrimp 
puffs...

INGRID
What you re describing is called 
 apophenia : the tendency to find 
mystical patterns or connections in 
random non-causally related events.  
Like when an old lady in Idaho sees 
the face of Jesus in a potato 
chip... it s not actually Jesus in 
the potato chip.  It s just the 
human condition to search for 
meaning in a universe ruled by 
chaos and coincidence.   

Ingrid eats a potato chip for emphasis.

FREYA
 I m saying you re Sonot just like 
Firestarter?

INGRID
I m saying you only have one super-
power.  And it s your breasts.

FREYA
They have gotten me out of a few 
speeding tickets...

Freya grabs Ingrid, they walk through the party together, arm 
in arm, affectionate.

(CONT D) FREYA
So why aren t you wearing the dress 
I lent you?

INGRID
I decided I didn t have the Lucite 
heels and stripper pole I needed to 
pull it off.

FREYA
You looked sexy.

INGRID
I looked silly.  6.



FREYA
You have no idea how hot you are, 
Ingrid!  You re my sister, and I 
love you, but you are never gonna 
get laid if you dress like you 
vagina. a have don t

INGRID
Maybe I don t wanna get laid.

FREYA
Everyone wants to get laid.  That 
is the human condition...

INGRID
Yeah well I know all the single men in 
this town.  And all I can say is...

She shrugs halfheartedly.

FREYA
What about that hot cop?  Matty?  
I ve seen how he looks at you.  
Plus he s always hanging around the 
library, chatting you up.

INGRID
Because he s dating my co-worker!

FREYA
So?  She s a ditz.  Besides, I m 
very intuitive.  I can read 
people s sexual auras you know.

INGRID
thing. a not That s

FREYA
Oh yes it is!  And I can tell from 
his sex aura, he really wants to 
throw you down on the counter 
and... get your decimal all dewy.

INGRID
That s disgusting.  But clever...

Freya scans the room, her eyes settle on: KILLIAN GARDINER, 
20s, brooding, trouble.  Freya stops walking, nudges Ingrid.

FREYA
Oooo.  What about him?7.



INGRID
Who is that?

FREYA
I don t know.  I ve never seen him 
before...

They stare.  Killian feels them looking at him.  He looks up, 
stares back at Freya intensely.  She stares back, entranced.  
Something passes between them, something deep and electric.  
 a There sWHITE FLOWER IN FREYA S HAIR, TUCKED BEHIND HER 
EAR.  IT BEGINS TO SUBTLY TURN PINK AS SHE STARES AT KILLIAN.  
He breaks into a seductive, knowing smile.  Freya looks away, 
suddenly breathless, the FLOWER IN HER HAIR NOW DARK RED.  
 stands, she where from flower the see can t who Ingrid,
nonetheless eyes Freya, shocked.

INGRID
Are you blushing?!

FREYA
No...

But she totally is. 


JOANNA enters the party in the spectacular foyer, looking 
 DIFFERENT wearing She s  herself. breath of out around,
CLOTHES than when we first met her, and her eyes no longer 
have that SUPERNATURAL GREEN SHADE.  DASH approaches.

DASH
Mrs. Beauchamp!  Welcome!

He kisses her cheek, hands her coat to a uniformed servant.  

JOANNA
Dashiell, we re at your engagement 
party.  You re marrying my 
daughter.  You can call me Joanna.

DASH
Sorry, of course.  Joanna.  So is 
this your first time at Fair Haven?

JOANNA
No, but it feels like a hundred years.

Joanna looks around, awed, full of emotion.  Dash watches.

DASH
It s a beautiful room isn t it?8.



JOANNA
How did you...?  It looks...

DASH
-Precisely as it did in 1897.  
Amazing, right?  We culled over 700 
photographs of the house in its 
original state in order to restore 
it to its former glory... I actually 
did a lot of the work myself.  My 
dirty secret is I d rather be in a 
toolbelt than a business suit.  
Don t tell my company s shareholders-

JOANNA
Well you did a fine job, Dash.  
  breathtaking. It s

DASH
Thank you, Mrs. Beauchamp.
(off her look)
Sorry.  Joanna.  I was raised to 
abide by certain formal rules of 
etiquette, it s a difficult habit 
to break.

JOANNA
Well you should know my daughter 
does not like rules, she hates 
etiquette, and if you tell her what 
to do, she will do the opposite.  
You re in for a rough ride, Dash...

DASH
That s what I love about Freya.  
Her independence, her spirit-

JOANNA
You ve only known her a few months.  
Check back with me in a year when 
you re ready to tear your hair out.

DASH
You don t approve of her marrying 
me, do you?

JOANNA
I think those rules of etiquette 
you mentioned prohibit you from 
asking me that question.  And they 
definitely prohibit me from 
answering.  Now if you ll excuse 
me, I believe I need a drink.9.



She throws him a wicked smile, and off she goes.


Ingrid is once again lurking by the cheese table.  MATTHEW 
the hot cop and CAITLIN his ditzy girlfriend approach.

CAITLIN
Ingrid!  OhmyGod I saw you over 
here like an hour ago.  Have you 
just been standing here eating 
cheese this whole time?!  

cheese. with stuffed is mouth her answer, can t Ingrid

MATTHEW
Congratulations.  On your sister s 
engagement.  This is a great party.

CAITLIN
I know, right?!  So awesome your 
sister s marrying Dash Gardiner!  
You re rich!

Caitlin. like doesn t She  politely. Smiles  swallows. Ingrid

INGRID
Actually, he s rich.  I still work 
at the library.

CAITLIN
I know silly!  I work there too.

Matthew and Ingrid exchange a look.

MATTHEW
So... did you guys know this house 
is over a hundred years old?  I bet 
it s got a fascinating history.

INGRID
Actually, it does.  The man who 
built it was a Satanist.  He put in 
all these tunnels and secret rooms 
where he d have ritual animal 
sacrifices and sadomasochistic sex 
orgies with people writhing around 
naked and covered in goat blood.

Caitlin and Matthew just stare at her for a beat.  Then-

CAITLIN
Ew.10.



MATTHEW
Hey -- you were writing a 
dissertation, weren t you?  About 
that kind of stuff-

Ingrid is embarrassed, she nods.

CAITLIN
About goat orgies?

INGRID
Witchcraft and occult practices in 
post-revolutionary New England...

Caitlin is bored, she drifts away, following a waiter passing 
by with a tray of champagne.

MATTHEW
Yeah, you told me about it, like 
three years ago.  I remember  cause 
it was the day I asked you out-

INGRID
You never asked me out-

MATTHEW
Yeah I did!  We were chatting at 
the library and you told me about 
your dissertation and I said  We 
should have dinner sometime.   And 
you laughed at me!

Ingrid is confused, then she realizes something, in horror.

INGRID
I thought you were kidding!

She can t believe it.  Matthew laughs.

MATTHEW
Why would I have been kidding?

Ingrid is stunned, Matthew grabs some cheese, amused.

(CONT D) MATTHEW
So how s it coming, anyway?  The 
dissertation.

INGRID
Fine!  Great.  Good.  I ve just 
been a little blocked for the 
last... thirty or so months... 11.



MATTHEW
Oh, I m sorry to hear it...  By the 
way you have a bunch of... cheese.  
In your... eyebrow...

Ingrid, horrified, tries to get the brie from her brow.  

(CONT D) MATTHEW
Warmer.  Warmer...

She grows more frantic.  Matthew reaches over with a napkin 
and wipes the cheese out himself.

(CONT D) MATTHEW
Got it.

They share a loaded look.  Ingrid clearly crushing on him, 
 rings, PHONE CELL Matt s  shy. too both and her, on him and
he steps away to answer it.

(CONT D) MATTHEW
This is Detective Torcoletti...

Caitlin returns with her drink, Ingrid eats some cheese.

INGRID
Mmmm.  Try the brie!  It s amazing.

CAITLIN
I don t eat cheese.  It makes you 
fat and farty.

Ingrid swallows the cheese, forces a smile... Matt rejoins 
Caitlin and Ingrid, hanging up his phone, he looks disturbed.

MATTHEW
I m so sorry.  I have to go... A 
couple were attacked out on north 
beach.

INGRID
Attacked?  Like, mugged?

MATTHEW
Like murdered.  Cait, I ll call you-

He kisses Caitlin s cheek then strides away, JOANNA 
approaches, overhearing the last of it, drinking champagne.

JOANNA
Oh my!  Did he say someone was 
murdered?  In our little town?  
horrible! just That s12.



CAITLIN
I know!  The one night I get him to 
dress up and do something romantic!  

Ingrid gives her a look, as she sulks away.  

JOANNA
Stand up straight honey.

INGRID
thirty. I m Mom,

JOANNA
And you slouch like a twelve year 
old.  I swear you hide your boobs 
as much as your damn sister flaunts 
hers.

Joanna sweeps away.  Ingrid stands alone, tries different 
postures and boob thrusts.  Ingrid's friend BARB (30s, round, 
cheerful) enters, excited, flushed.

INGRID
Oh thank God, somebody normal!  
You re late.  Where ve you been?!

BARB
-Bob and I got here an hour ago.  
But I took a wrong turn looking for 
the bathroom and I got lost.  This 
place is like a maze.

INGRID
Yeah, that s actually how it was 
designed, the interior structure 
forms a five pointed star- 

BARB
-Yeah, yeah, fascinating.  You will 
never guess what I found in one of 
the rooms.

She pulls Ingrid toward a hallway.

INGRID
Barb!  I m not snooping around 
someone s private stuff!

BARB
You re gonna wanna see this.

She leads Ingrid away, they pass...13.




...Freya and Dash, slow-dancing to the music in the ballroom.

FREYA
I can t believe you re leaving 
tomorrow, again!  You ve only been 
back a week!  And I can t even be 
mad at you  cause you re off 
building hospitals for war orphans.

DASH
You should come sometime!  I bet 
you d love it.  Sure, there s no 
clean water and the rebel armies 
are shooting at the pro-government 
militias and the pro-government 
militias are shooting at us but -- 
 really actually it sfun.

FREYA
I think you and I have slightly 
different definitions of fun.

DASH
Yeah?  What s your definition?

He twirls her around, dips her playfully, she shrieks, happy.  

FREYA
Anything I get to do with you.

DASH
Wow.  Me too!  We should, like, get 
married or something.

FREYA
We totally should!

They kiss, happy, smiling, laughing, in love.  Dash notices 
KILLIAN approaching, looking brooding and hotttttttt.  

DASH
Killian!  You made it.

Dash releases Freya, she stares at Killian, mouth agape, as 
 looks Freya gaze, Freya s meets Killian hug, Dash and Killian
away, instantly flushed.

DASH (CONT D)
Freya, this is my brother Killian, 
Killian, this is... my wife.  To 
be.14.



 on has he effect the by unnerved hand, Killian s shakes Freya
her, trying to keep it together.

DASH (CONT D)
Bit underdressed aren t you?
(to Freya)
Killian is allergic to ties.

Killian shrugs, his is wearing sexy tattered jeans, 
motorcycle boots, etc.  He s James fucking Dean!

FREYA
Dash has told me a lot about you... 
I hear you ve been travelling...

DASH
Yes, where was it, South America, 
or Southeast Asia?  Or was it both?
(to Freya)
He thinks he s Jack Kerouac, this 
one, always off riding a 
motorcycle, surfing, living with 
monks, working the whole brooding, 
tortured, angry young man bit, 
breaking all the local girls  
hearts.  It s like a sport with 
  it? isn t you,

Killian shakes his head as he stares hauntingly at Freya, 
still holding her hand, she pulls away, breathless.

FREYA
Will you excuse me?  I m gonna... 
ladies room... 

She hurries away, unnerved.  Killian watches her go.


Freya enters a quiet hallway, tries to breathe.

FREYA
(to herself)
What is wrong with you?!

She takes a deep breath, closes her eyes, Killian walks up 
behind her, walks right past her, she startles, he turns to 
look at her.  Stares at her, as if to say come with me... He 
follows... she herself: help can t She  walking. keeps15.




Barb leads Ingrid into a room LINED WITH TONS OF OLD 
PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SKETCHES, AND ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS OF FAIR 
HISTORY. HOUSE S THE DOCUMENTING HAVEN,  Small votive candles 
are placed throughout the room, casting an eerie, romantic 
light.

BARB
Okay, so I m going into room after 
room after room, and I can t find 
the damn bathroom, and then I come 
in here, I see all these pictures, 
and I m like:  neat!   Right?  And 
then I notice this...

Barb points to a PHOTO, FRAMED ON THE WALL.  Ingrid steps in 
closer, looks at it, STUNNED:

 HAVEN, FAIR OF FRONT IN STANDING HER, OF PICTURE A IT S
 WOMAN 40ISH A THERE S  BROOMSTICK. LOOKING ANCIENT AN HOLDING
WITH HER, WEARING A DISTINCTIVE JEWELED NECKLACE.  THE PHOTO

INGRID
What the hell?!

IN A COOL EFFECT, WE DRIFT THROUGH THE WALL, TO THE NEXT 
ROOM...


A small powder room.  Tight quarters.  Killian and Freya 
enter, he closes the door behind them.  They stare at each

Killian nods: he knows she does.16.

As Ingrid stares at the photo in her hands, the WALL SHAKES, 
the photos on it shake, the candles around the room shake, 
like an earthquake, but it s from Freya and Killian s 
passion.  

A VASE OF FLOWERS ON THE TABLE SPONTANEOUSLY BURSTS INTO 
FLAMES!  

The flames catch the photo in Ingrid's hand.  She yelps and 
drops the photo to the ground!  She and Barb look at each 
other, completely freaked: What the hell?!

END OF ACT ONE17.



ACT TWO


 PAINTING: A ON CLOSE WE RE ECHOES, SCREAM -THEIT S A 
DISTURBING IMAGE OF A MAN IN A DESERT ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES, 
UNDER THE HOT SUN, DYING OF THIRST.  HIS FACE IS VIVID AND 
 MUNCH S OF REMINISCENT TORMENTED,THE SCREAM.  

FREYA walks past the painting, hung among many cool paintings 
ranging in style on the walls of this eclectic and super-cool 
house, filled with art and antiques, so warm and inviting.  


Freya enters the AMAZING COZY KITCHEN, where JOANNA makes 
breakfast while INGRID reads the local paper.  Freya grabs a 
piece of bacon off a handmade plate on the counter.

INGRID
So they interviewed the fisherman 
who found Bill and Maura Thatcher 
last night, and get this -- he says 
the murderer ripped Bill s out 
eyeballs and tongue.  Just ripped 
 em right out!  How gross is that?  

Freya puts down the bacon, indeed grossed out.

(CONT D) INGRID
And Maura s in a coma, they have no 
idea if she ll make it...  18.



Joanna shakes her head sadly.

JOANNA
Who would do something so awful?!

Freya pours herself some coffee, and has a GUILTY YET SEXY 
FLASH-


-FREYA AND KILLIAN MAKE OUT AGAINST THE WALL OF THE BATHROOM.  
HE LIFTS UP HER SKIRT SLOWLY, SO SEXY, HIS FINGERS PRESSING 
INTO THE FLESH OF HER THIGH-


-Freya cringes over her coffee, remembering, and-

HER COFFEE MUG SHATTERS IN HER HANDS.  

Freya jumps back, startled!

FREYA
What the hell?!

Joanna swoops in with a sponge.

JOANNA
There s my clumsy girl...

FREYA
Did you guys see that?  It, like -- 
spontaneously broke!  For no 
reason!  Tell me you saw that.

Joanna gives her a look like she s crazy.

JOANNA
I saw you knock into the counter...

FREYA
I was nowhere near the counter! 

Joanna eyes Freya.

JOANNA
-Sweetie, are you okay?  You seem a 
little...

FREYA
(guilty over Killian)
-I m fine.  19.



JOANNA
I bet I know what it is...

FREYA
You do...?

JOANNA
You re nervous!  About the wedding.  
You re having second thoughts-

Freya sighs, they ve been through this before.

FREYA
-You re the one having second 
thoughts, not me.

JOANNA
I just don t see what the hurry is.  
You re very young, you barely know 
him, you re not pregnant... Wait, 
 you renot pregnant, are you?!

FREYA
-No!  Mom.  Jeez.  I m not pregnant-

JOANNA
-Okay!  Great!  So what s the rush?

INGRID
The rush is, she has no idea what 
she actually wants to do with her 
life, and getting married feels 
like doing something with her life.  
Even if it s the wrong thing.

FREYA
Hey, I am perfectly happy doing 
what I m doing. I like being a 
bartender.  I m good at it. I bring 
joy and drunkenness to people in 
need... Plus -- I am in love with 
Dash Gardiner!  I ve never felt 
this way about anyone.  I know it s 
right.  We belong together -- so I 
don t care what you think!  

JOANNA
-Freya, I just wanna know you re 
thinking this thing through.  Dash 
travels a lot for work, and how are 
you gonna handle that?  You do tend 
to get a little... restless- 20.



FREYA
So you think I m cheating on him?!

INGRID
What are you talking about?  Nobody 
said that-

FREYA
I can be faithful.  I will be 
faithful -- I mean, I am already 
being faithful.

JOANNA
Nobody said you weren t.

FREYA
I have to go see Dash.

She hurries out, guilty.  Joanna and Ingrid exchange a look: 
what was that all about?  


MAURA THATCHER lies in a coma, her face bruised and bandaged, 
the machines BEEPING.  We drift out the door...


And down the hall...

Where the FRANTIC WOMAN who was driving the car that hit the 
cat is being interviewed by the HOT COP, MATTHEW.  

FRANTIC WOMAN
It was a cat!  I m telling you!  I 
hit a cat, not a woman!

Matthew nods indulgently.

MATTHEW
Uh-huh...  Cause it looks an awful 
lot like you hit a naked woman...

We see the CORPSE, COVERED WITH A SHEET, BEING WHEELED PAST 
THEM TOWARD AN ELEVATOR by an ORDERLY.  We follow him, he 
waits at the elevator, next to a NURSE.

ORDERLY
Two bodies in two days.  North 
Hampton morgue hasn t seen this 
much action in a long time.21.



The sheet FALLS AWAY, REVEALING THE DEAD WOMAN.  The nurse 
peers at her.

NURSE
Cool necklace...

The WOMAN S dead face is peaceful...


A super-sweaty naked FREYA rolls off a sweaty and satisfied 
if somewhat surprised DASH.  

DASH
Wow.  That was... wow.  What the 
hell inspired that?!

FREYA
I thought you needed a proper send 
off. Plus I want you to hurry back.

DASH
Believe me, I will.  

FREYA
Are you sure we should wait to get 
married?  Maybe we should do it 
right away.  Cancel your trip!  We 
can elope!

Dash touches her face tenderly, concerned.

DASH
If I didn t know better, I d swear 
you were worried you re gonna 
change your mind...

Freya blinks at him, dead serious.

FREYA
I will never change my mind.

DASH
Neither will I.

kisses him, climbs on top, ready to go again, but then-

SHE CATCHES HER REFLECTION IN A MIRROR BY THE BED  - SHE CAN 
SEE OVER HER SHOULDER  - KILLIAN IN THE DOORWAY, WATCHING. 

Freya gasps, turns her head -- BUT THE DOORWAY IS EMPTY.22.




Evil Joanna enters the quiet empty house, stares up at the 
PAINTING OF THE MAN IN THE DESERT.  She walks toward it, 
enthralled.

Evil Joanna LIGHTS A CANDLE, dark black smoke billows from 
the flame, she recites a CHANT in an ancient language.  

EVIL JOANNA
Mysticum flamma aperire pictura, 
mysticum flamma aperire pictura...

THE PAINTING BEGINS TO UNDULATE, IN A SUPERCOOL EFFECT, THE 
 THE  LIFE. TO COMING IT S LIKE CANVAS, THE ON TWISTING PAINT
MAN IN THE PAINTING MOVES HIS ARM -- THE CANVAS BULGES WITH 
HIS FINGERS.  JOANNA SMILES AND KEEPS CHANTING, HER FACE 
MORPHING INTO SOMETHING SUBTLY DEMONIC, JUST AS IT DID BEFORE 
SHE ATTACK BILL AND MAURA THATCHER ON THE BEACH-


Evil Joanna, chanting, hears the key in the door, her eyes 
widen, she blows out the candle, the paint STOPS MOVING.


-And enters.  Nothing is amiss.  She looks around for her 
supplies.  There they are!  A CANVAS BAG FULL OF ART SUPPLIES  
She picks it up, feels a BREEZE and turns and notices a 
WINDOW LEFT OPEN.  She walks over and shuts it.


The little DOOR in the wall where a body is kept is KICKED 
OPEN from the inside.  THE NAKED WOMAN WITH THE NECKLACE 
WRIGGLES HER WAY OUT, SHIVERING (it s a refrigerator after 
all)  She looks around, cracks her neck and her knuckles.  
Finds a LAB COAT on a hook and puts it on.  We focus in on 
the necklace as she goes...


 back pull We  NECKLACE. SAME THE OF DOODLE A ON CLOSE We re

fabulous -- he takes a peek at her doodle.

HUDSON
Oooo, are we designing jewelry now?

INGRID
No.  Just doodling...

He makes a face, shakes his head.

HUDSON
Good,  cause that s tacky.

She stares at the drawing, thoughtful.

INGRID
I saw this picture last night.  
This really old picture.  It was 
probably my great great grandmother 
or maybe a second cousin or a 
distant aunt or something but... 
whoever she was, she looked like 
me.  But she s long since dead.

INGRID (CONT'D)
And ever since I saw it, I can t 
stop thinking about how short life 
is.  And how you only get one... 
Kinda makes you think, doesn t it?

HUDSON
You mean, about how your little 
sister s getting married to an uber-
wealthy philanthropist-slash-sex-
God, while you re thirty years old 
and still living at home, lost in a 
sea of confusion and regret, 
terrified your pubic hair will turn 
gray before another human being

Which is okay, because they make 
pubic hair dye now.  So either way, 
fine. be you ll

He kisses her cheek, as BARB enters, and Hudson moves off.

INGRID
Hey Barbie.  What s up?

BARB
I just talked to the doctor.  Our 
last try with the IVF failed.  We 
don t have enough money for another 
round.  Apparently Bob has lazy 
sperm and I have a tipped uterus... 
The doctor said at this point, it 
would take a miracle to get me 
pregnant.

Ingrid puts her arm around Barb, feeling awful for her.

INGRID
I m so sorry honey, is there 
anything I can do...?

Barb looks at her with naive hope in her eyes.

BARB
Well, you wrote that dissertation 
about witchcraft.  Did it have any 
get pregnant spells?

INGRID
Oh sweetie.  That was just an 
academic study, it wasn t a how-
to... 
(MORE)25.

INGRID (CONT'D)
But if there were such a thing as 
witchcraft, and I somehow had the 
ability to use it... you d be the 
first person I d help.

BARB
Yeah.  I figured it was a long 
shot.  But it was worth a try...

Barb wipes away a tear, tries to smile, Ingrid holds her 
tight.


  bed. opulent overstuffed Dash s in peacefully sleeps Freya

PENELOPE (O.S.)
WAKE UP!

Freya bolts up in bed, naked.  PENELOPE stands at the foot of 
the bed, holding a YAPPY LITTLE DOG.  

(CONT D) PENELOPE
Dear, I thought you d wanna get up.  
Dash left hours ago.

Freya nods, sleepy but happy to think of Dash.

FREYA
I know.  We already said our good-byes.

PENELOPE
Yes, I could hear you.  We could 
all hear you.  But now it s 3:30 in 
the afternoon...

FREYA
That s okay.  I don t have to be at 
work  til 8.

PENELOPE
I should think you d want to get 
home first though?  To your own 
house?  Put on... some clothes?

FREYA
When I marry Dash, this will be my 
home.

PENELOPE
 still it s Butmy house, dear.  And 
you don t live here yet.26.



She turns to leave, Freya narrows her eyes at Penelope, as if 
willing something to happen-

Penelope SCREAMS as her little dog PEES ON HER!! 

 -- laugh to not tries she mouth, her to flies hand Freya s
  it. believe can t sheDid I do that?!  


INGRID works behind the counter, gathering up books, while 
HUDSON surfs the net, entertaining himself rather than 
working.  Ingrid tries to rid herself of a wedgie.

INGRID
Oh my God my butt is like eating my 
underwear!

She turns to see MATTHEW the hot cop, standing at the 
counter.  He saw/heard everything.  She s horrified.

(CONT D) INGRID
Hi... 

MATTHEW
Hey...

INGRID
Caitlin ll be right out.  She s 
just...

HUDSON
-She s in the bathroom, practicing 
her  I m A Deep And Caring Person  
face.

Ingrid gives him a look, he shrugs.  Matthew looks at Ingrid.

MATTHEW
Hey, I thought of something funny 
earlier.  You know your dissertation?

INGRID
Yeah...

MATTHEW
You should call it a  witch-
ertation.   Get it?!   Cause it s 
about witches...

She looks at him, bemused, not sure what to make of his dorky 
sense of humor, as CAITLIN sweeps over, kisses Matthew.

CAITLIN
Ready, baby? 

Matthew nods.  Ingrid watches them embrace, pained.28.



(CONT D) CAITLIN
See ya guys!

Caitlin bops away with Matthew, Ingrid watches, bummed.  
Hudson is amused.

HUDSON
 A witch-ertation?   Too bad he s 
with Miss Hair Product.  That guy 
is your dork soulmate.

sad. still enters, Barb  true. it s knowing sighs, Ingrid

INGRID
lady? doin  ya How

 wants Ingrid  head. her shakes just answer, even can t Barb
to help her friend so much...

(CONT D) INGRID
Okay, I have an idea.  It s 
incredibly stupid, and I can t 
believe I m suggesting it, but... 
you wanna do a fertility spell?

BARB
Are you serious?!

INGRID
Look, I m still a rational skeptic, 
but it might be fun.  And I do 
believe in the placebo effect...

BARB
I don t know what that means.

INGRID
It means if you believe something 
will work... sometimes it does.  And 
nobody knows why.  So I say what the 
hell!  It can t hurt, right?

BARB
Yes!  Fun!  That s just what I 
need!

She throws her arms around Ingrid.  Ingrid turns to Hudson.

INGRID
Wanna help us cast a magic spell to 
try to get Barb pregnant?

Hudson considers it.  Then-29.



HUDSON
Only if I can make hats.


Wendy tries on a HAT in the mirror, Joanna searches her 
closet for clothes to lend her.

WENDY
I can t believe I got hit by a car!  
That s almost dumber than the time 
I died of syphilis.

JOANNA
So how many...?

WENDY
Lives do I have left?  I don t 
know.  A few.  Who keeps count.

JOANNA
I would.  If I only had nine.

Wendy keeps trying on outfits Joanna throws her.

WENDY
You deal with your curses.  I ll 
deal with mine.
(then)
I hate all of your clothes.  For a 
so-called artist you kinda dress 
like a schoolteacher.

JOANNA
I am a schoolteacher.  I teach art.

WENDY
Oh.  Sorry... I can t believe you 
actually let me in: every time I 
call lately, you hang up.

JOANNA
Lately?  You haven t called since 
1972.

WENDY
Well I got sick of trying.  Plus I 
had a lot going on: I moved to New 
Orleans, opened up a little voodoo 
shop in the French Quarter, got 
married, got divorced, got married 
again, got widowed -- eaten by a 
crocodile, I m not even kidding...  
(MORE)30.

WENDY (CONT'D)
I still try to keep an eye on you 
though.  From afar... Even though you 
hate me-

Joanna rolls her eyes.

JOANNA
-I don t hate you... I was just... 
mad.  Anyway, I know you re a big 
fan of dramatic suspense and all, 
but... I haven t seen you in a 
century, and then suddenly you show 
up half-naked on my doorstep, 
telling me I m in some sort of 
danger... Care to elaborate?

WENDY
I was getting to that!  But first -- 
where are the girls?  We re gonna 
need their help-

Wendy walks over to the mantle, kneels down before the 
fireplace, where wood is stacked.  She snaps her fingers a 
 and flint striking she s if as FLY, SPARKS times, couple
steel.  She snaps again and a FLAME JUMPS FROM HER FINGERS 
ONTO THE WOOD.  The fire ignites, with BLUE-GREEN FLAMES.  
AMAZING.  BEAUTIFUL.  MAGIC.  Joanna stalks over with her 
ICED TEA in hand, throws it on the fire.  It goes out.

JOANNA
No way.  Whatever this is... I m 
keeping them out of it.  And no magic 
while you re here.  House rules-

WENDY
What are you talking about?

JOANNA
The girls don t know... what they are-

WENDY
What do you mean they don t know?

JOANNA
I didn t tell them this time.

WENDY
How could you not tell them?!

JOANNA
I wanted to see if I could change 
their fate.31.



WENDY
You can t change fate!  That s why 
it s called  fate.   It s... fated.

JOANNA
I just... got sick of it.  The 
endless cycle-

WE POP TO:


JOANNA, NOW IN VICTORIAN GARB, WATCHES AS 8 YEAR OLD FREYA 
SNAPS HER FINGERS AND A FIRE STARTS IN THE FIREPLACE, 13 YEAR 
OLD INGRID CLAPS.

JOANNA (V.O.)
They grow up, they practice magic-32.




JOANNA, FREYA AND INGRID COOK IN THE KITCHEN, FREYA TAKES A 
SAD LOOKING TOMATO, HOLDS IT IN HER HANDS AND CONCENTRATES -- 
IT GROWS PLUMP AND JUICY.  JOANNA KISSES HER CHEEK 
APPROVINGLY. 

JOANNA (V.O.)

bedroom. Joanna s in Wendy and Joanna with back we re And

JOANNA
I ve given birth to them and 
watched them die at least a dozen 
times, and Freya s still never made 
it past twenty-five.  Ingrid's 
never made it past thirty.  I m 
sick of it.  I decided, this life, 
for once... they d be normal.33.



WENDY
So you re denying them their 
birthright?!

JOANNA
I m trying to give them something 
they ve never ever had, not in 
hundreds of years of so-called 
immortality: a long and happy life.  

WENDY
You think you re cursed?  At least 
you had children.

Joanna looks at Wendy with centuries of sadness.

JOANNA
Having children is my curse.

WENDY
You can t hide their powers 
forever, Joanna.  These things have 
a way of coming out, whether you 
want them to or not...

Joanna considers this, not happy at the prospect...


FREYA tends bar at this quaint inn.  A vintage jukebox blasts 
 on sawdust table, pool a board, dart a There s  rock. classic
the floor, old brass taps.  

Freya stares at a JAR OF OLIVES, concentrating.  She s joined 
by her boss ROGER YEARWOOD, 60s, African-American, 
affectionate, a surrogate father.

ROGER
What are you doing?

FREYA
I m trying to make this jar of 
olives explode... with my mind.

ROGER
And are you gonna clean it up... 
with your mind?

FREYA
I m totally serious.  I made a dog 
pee today, just by focusing really 
hard.34.



ROGER
say... don t You

FREYA
-I can t explain it, it s like when 
I was a kid, and I was convinced I 
had supernatural powers.  My Mom 
even sent me to a shrink, twice a 
week for a whole year... Well, 
who s crazy now, am I right?!

She goes back to staring at the olives, Roger gives her a 
 As  nutbar. a she s like lookKILLIAN enters.  He walks over 
and sits down at the bar.  Freya puts down the olive jar, 
gives him a cold look.  He smiles at her.  She scowls.

KILLIAN
So are you just gonna stand there 
scowling at me or can I have a 
drink?

Freya smooths down her apron, playing it cool.

FREYA
What can I get you, sir?

KILLIAN
What do you recommend?

FREYA
I recommend you leave now and never 
come back.

KILLIAN
Why don t you make me the house 
special?  I hear you re an artist, 
that your drinks are practically 
aphrodisiacs.

FREYA
You don t need an aphrodisiac.

KILLIAN
I agree.  But I ll try it anyway.

FREYA
But then you ll just end up all hot 
and bothered, and alone and 
frustrated...

Killian stares at her with his sexy/hungry/swoon-worthy gaze.35.



KILLIAN
I m already frustrated.

FREYA
Well get used to it.

Freya mixes him an elaborate drink, involving MINT, HERBS, AN 
ANCIENT MARBLE MORTAR AND PESTLE.  She takes an olive out of 
the jar.  IT PLUMPS RIGHT IN HER HAND! even doesn t She  
notice, she s distracted by Killian.

KILLIAN
So I m staying on my boat, it s 
docked at Fair Haven.  It s a 
little cramped but I think we can 
make do.

FREYA
What are you talking about?

KILLIAN
You re coming by after your shift, 
yes?

Freya laughs.

FREYA
No!

KILLIAN
Why not?

FREYA
Because I m engaged to your 
brother.

KILLIAN
Didn t stop you last night...

Freya pours the drink into a cool old mason jar.

FREYA
It was a momentary lapse.

KILLIAN
I bet you have a lot of those.

Freya ANGRILY THROWS THE DRINK IN HIS FACE.

FREYA
Go to hell.36.



She turns and walks away.  Killian calmly wipes his face, 
licks the drink from his finger -- yum.


Freya paces in the back hall, attempting to collect herself.  
We can hear the sounds of the bar from the next room.  
KILLIAN walks up, tentative, regretful.  Freya is upset, 
trying to hold it together.

KILLIAN
I m sorry.  Freya, I like that 
you re the girl who does what she 
wants.  Who doesn t care if she 
breaks the rules.  It s... 
intriguing.

FREYA
-You don t know anything about me.  
I m not just gonna take up with the 
first hot guy I see as soon as my 
fiancee s back is turned!  That s 
not who I am!

A beat.  He raises an eyebrow, pleased.

KILLIAN
hot? I m think you So

Freya would like to scream in frustration.

FREYA
Why can t you leave me alone?!

KILLIAN
Because I can t.  Do you really 
want me to?

Freya doesn t answer.  Killian stares at her, pained.

(CONT D) KILLIAN
Why him?

Freya takes a beat, then answers honestly.

FREYA
He s the only man I ve ever met who 
I know would never hurt me.

KILLIAN
And that s what you want?  The safe 
choice?37.



  KISSING. THEY RE  BOOM! then And other. each at look They
upset. away, him pushes Freya until passionate... crazy It s

FREYA
Stay away from me.

She walks away.  He watches, but doesn t follow.


Ingrid, Hudson, and Barb wear WITCH HATS made from 
construction paper and glitter. Ingrid and Hudson are on 
their hands and knees, drawing around Barb in chalk.

HUDSON
We re not gonna like... awaken any 
evil spirits are we?

INGRID
First of all, this is white magic, 
not black magic, and secondly... 
 as thing such no there sany kind 
of magic, so I m guessing not.

Ingrid picks up a PRINT OUT and reads.

(CONT D) INGRID
Okay, so it says here we need to 
join hands around Barb and do the 
chant while she massages her uterus.  
Are you massaging your uterus?

Barb rubs her stomach in circles.

BARB
I have no idea...

INGRID
Looks good to me.  Okay.  Here 
goes.

Ingrid and Hudson join hands and chant, reading from print 
 they re see can and above, from them on down look We  outs.
standing in a LARGE CHALK PENTAGRAM.

INGRID AND HUDSON
(chanting)
Nostri incantatores facit fertilis 
semen...

HUDSON
Heh.   Semen. 38.



Ingrid looks at him, annoyed.

INGRID
What are you, twelve?  It s Latin.  
  seed.  means It

Hudson giggles again.  Ingrid is exasperated.

(CONT D) INGRID
Are we doing this or not?

HUDSON
Wow.  Suddenly Miss I m-Too-Good-
For-Witchcraft is kinda gettin  
into the witchcraft.  

INGRID
I believe if you do something, you 
should do it right. Now come on.

They begin to chant again.  Barb closes her eyes, focusing.

INGRID AND HUDSON
Nostri incantatores facit fertilis 
semen...  Nostri incantatores facit 
fertilis semen... Nostri 
incantatores facit fertilis 
semen...

Barb opens her eyes.

BARB
Shouldn t there be, like, flashing 
lights or a puff of smoke or something?

INGRID
From the fake spell we got off the 
internet?  

HUDSON
I m bored.  You guys wanna go grab 
a drink at the North Inn?

BARBINGRID
Yes please.Totally.

They throw off their hats, and head for the door, Ingrid 
turns off the lights and closes the door behind her.  The 
room is empty, quiet.  THE PENTAGRAM TAKES ON AN EERIE 
GLOW...39.




By candlelight, Joanna fixes two glasses of ABSINTHE.  She 
lights a sugar cube on fire and puts it in each glass.  She 
hands a glass to Wendy.  Wendy sips it, grateful.

WENDY
I know you ve been angry at me 
these last hundred years...

JOANNA
Why would I be angry at you?  You 
only killed my eldest daughter...

WENDY
It was an accident.  And besides, 
Ingrid was reborn...

JOANNA
It s never the same.  She s always 
a little bit different.  And every 
time I lose them, it gets a little 
bit harder...

WENDY
Well I m here to make it up to 
you... When we were banished to 
this world, it was with a curse on 
our heads.  Mine was nine lives.  
Freya and Ingrid s was rebirth 
without memory.  And yours was 
immortality with endless 
 not you re But  motherhood.really 
immortal, are you, Joanna?  I mean, 
if someone wanted to kill you -- 
really wanted to kill you -- they 
could.  With the right spell... 
Same with the girls.  The right 
spell, in the wrong hands, wouldn t 
just kill Freya and Ingrid, but 
stop them from being reborn.  This 
is a truth you don t like to think 
about.  But it s there, and you 
know it.

JOANNA
What are you getting at?

WENDY
You re in serious danger.40.



JOANNA
Yes, but you don t seem to want to 
tell me what the hell you mean.

WENDY
Get out your cards.

JOANNA
I don t know where they are.

WENDY
Yes you do.

Joanna sighs, gets up, goes to an ANTIQUE HUTCH, opens a 
secret compartment hidden deep within.  She grabs an ANCIENT 
TAROT DECK, hands it to Wendy, who deals it expertly.

(CONT D) WENDY
I had a dream the other night.  I 
saw you.  Your eyes were green, 
almost... glowing.  Because it 
wasn t you.  It was a shapeshifter.  
Someone who d made themselves look 
like you.  Someone doing evil in 
your name.  When I woke up, I dealt 
the deck, for you.  I couldn t 
believe what I saw.  I thought I 
must ve made a mistake.  So I dealt 
again, and again, and always the 
same thing....

We see from above, the cards are laid out on the table, 
it. examines Joanna  understand. don t we story a telling

JOANNA
right. be can t This

WENDY
See?  Right here: the Imposter.  
Look at the eyes! 

Wendy points to a card featuring a shadowy figure with DEEP 
GREEN EYES.  Then, Wendy points to another card.

(CONT D) WENDY
And here -- this one didn t make 
sense at first, but now I get it: 
 The Cloak Pulled Back.   The 
powers you hid from your daughters 
are about to be revealed.

They stare down at the cards.  Wendy shakes her head.41.



(CONT D) WENDY
The life you ve built here is about 
to change, Joanna.  Upheaval, 
death, destruction... pain, 
imprisonment, betrayal.  It s 
coming for you.  Like nothing 
seen. ever you ve

Joanna refuses to believe what she sees.

JOANNA
Hold on.  Don t get dramatic.  
You re always so damn dramatic!  

Joanna holds out her palms, THE CARDS FLY INTO HER HANDS, 
ARRANGING THEMSELVES INTO A PERFECT DECK.

 what like Doesn t  quickly. them, redeals and shuffles She
she sees.  Frustrated, Joanna SNAPS and the cards FLY BACK TO 
HER AGAIN.  She deals again.  Same exact configuration. 

(CONT D) JOANNA
How can this be happening?!  

WENDY
First things first: your enemy.  
The one who can make herself look 
like you.  From the lay of the 
cards, I d say she doesn t have the 
tools to kill you quite yet.  She s 
still searching for a way.  That 
gives us some time.  Who do you 
think it could be?

JOANNA
I have absolutely no idea!  

WENDY
Is there anyone new in town?  You 
said someone bought Fair Haven.  
That boy who s marrying Freya?

JOANNA
mortal. He s  No.

WENDY
How do you know?

JOANNA
Because, in all of her lives, over 
hundreds of years, Freya s only 
been in love with two men.42.



Wendy sighs -- it s not a happy memory.

WENDY
And we know how that ended.

JOANNA
 been There s Exactly...a lot of 
men since, but they were flings.  
No one even came close... and then 
Dash moves to town, and suddenly, 
she wants to get married?!  It 
happened so fast, it just felt... 
strange.  Wrong.  Almost like she 
was under a spell.  I figured 
there s no way he was human- 

Joanna FLASHES on:


JOANNA serves dinner to DASH and FREYA.  

JOANNA (V.O.)
So I tested him.

 with arm his cuts  accidentally  she and Dash, serves Joanna
a knife, drawing blood.  Dash reacts.

DASHJOANNA
Ow!Oopsie!

FREYA
Mom, did you just stab my fiancee?

JOANNA
So clumsy!  I ll get a band-aid.

 Dash s from hairs few a PLUCKS subtly she go, to turns she As
head.  He flinches.

DASH
Ow!

JOANNA
Gotta stay on top of those grays!

Freya eyes Joanna like she s lost it.

FREYA
What s wrong with you?!

JOANNA
Nothing!  Be right back!43.



Joanna exits, Freya comforts Dash.

FREYA
Sorry baby.  She s nuts.

He smiles, shrugs.  She kisses him.  He kisses her back.  It 
grows more passionate and grope-y... We reveal INGRID across 
the table, watching them go at it, grossed out.


Joanna takes the KNIFE, STILL SLICK WITH DASH S BLOOD, PUTS 
THE HAIRS ON TOP.

JOANNA
Dico me est hoc creatura humana... 

SHE PUTS THE KNIFE TO THE STOVE FLAME, THE FLAME KICKS UP HIGH 
THEN DISAPPEARS. SHE EXAMINES THE BURNT HAIR AND BLOOD.  
JOANNA IS SURPRISED BY WHAT SHE SEES.  INGRID enters, annoyed.

INGRID
Freya and Dash are practically 
humping on the table.  It s pretty 
gross... What are you doing?

Joanna quickly wipes the knife on a kitchen rag.

JOANNA
Just finishing up the pie!

She smiles innocently, Ingrid regards her suspiciously.


Joanna takes a sip of absinthe, shakes her head.  

JOANNA
The test was definitive: Dash 
Gardiner is just an ordinary man...  
Only very rich.  

WENDY
Well, all I know is, the cards don t 
lie.  You have an enemy, Joanna.  
Someone whose power rivals your own.  
They re out to hurt you, and they 
won t stop until you and your girls 
are dead.  Forever dead...  

Off Joanna, taking this in.

END OF ACT THREE44.



ACT FOUR


FREYA BOLTS AWAKE IN BED, bathed in sweat.  She takes a deep 
breath, tries to shake off the dream.  She reaches for her 
phone.  DASH answers on the other end, in a FACETIME CHAT.

DASH
Hey baby!  

FREYA
Heyyyy.  You look purty.

DASH
Liar.  I just go off a twelve hour 
flight and then went straight to 
the hospital for a tour.  I m 
exhausted.  But you should see what 
a difference we re making here, 
amazing. It s  babe.45.



FREYA
I m so proud of you.  My man, out 
saving the world...

DASH
What are you doing up?  It s like 4 
am there...

FREYA
I had a nightmare.

DASH
Oh no!  What happened?

FREYA
It doesn t matter.  I just wanted 
to say... I want to be worthy of 
you.  When I see myself through 
your eyes, I see a good person.  
I ve never felt like that person 
before and I like that person and I 
wanna try to be that person and 
that s why I m marrying you, to be 
the person I see you see me being.

He smiles at her ramblings.

DASH
Remind me not to let you write our 
vows.

FREYA
Sorry.  I just... I love you.

DASH
I love you more, crazy girl.  I 
miss you so much it hurts.  When I 
come back, let s go away for a long 
weekend.  Just you and me.  Dream 
about that, okay?  I ll call you 
later.

She nods, they hang up.  She lays back, trying not to freak.


Joanna paints at her easel.  Ingrid makes breakfast.

INGRID
So you re saying she s crazy.

JOANNA
I m saying she s... eccentric.46.



Freya enters in her PJs.

FREYA
eccentric? Who s

INGRID
Our aunt.

FREYA
We have an aunt?

JOANNA
I told you girls about Wendy!

INGRID
I always just assumed you made her 
up as a cautionary tale about what 
happens when sisters fight.  

JOANNA
No, she s very real.  She s 
upstairs in the attic, sleeping. 
And you girls should know, she s... 
a little off.  

Suddenly a BLACK CAT WEARING A BEJEWELED NECKLACE jumps up on 
the table.  Freya and Ingrid scream.  Joanna shoos the cat 
off the table with her paintbrush, annoyed.

(CONT D) JOANNA
Also, she brought her cat.  Bad 
cat!  If you re not careful I m 
gonna have you spayed!

The cat HISSES at her.  Joanna exits with it.  Freya and 
Ingrid look at each other.  Ingrid shrugs, as if to say: 
 Mom s nuts. 


Joanna whispers heatedly with WENDY, now back in human form, 
naked but for her necklace. 

WENDY
So I m a little off, am I?

JOANNA
Look, I appreciate you coming to 
help out with the whole someone s 
trying to kill me thing.  But the 
one rule I ask you abide while 
you re here, is stay in human form.  
And don t involve the girls in this-47.



WENDY
rules. two That s

JOANNA
And go put on some clothes!

WENDY
-Were you not paying attention last 
night?  The girls are gonna figure 
out who they are, whether you want 
them to or not-

JOANNA
-Not if we stop this ourselves 
first!  Now get dressed!

WENDY
Okay, find me something that 
doesn t make me look like a bowl of 
oatmeal!

Joanna follows Wendy up the stairs, we hover on that PAINTING 
OF THE MAN IN THE DESERT AGAIN.


Freya makes herself a fancy coffee, Ingrid flips pancakes.  
Freya makes a foam heart in the coffee.

FREYA
Do you think it s possible to have 
two soulmates?

Freya stares at the heart in her coffee.  It breaks apart..

INGRID
I don t think it s possible to have 
one soulmate.  I think soulmates is 
a concept Hollywood invented to 
sell tickets to Meg Ryan movies.

FREYA
Okay... do you think it s possible 
to be in love with two men at once?

INGRID
No, I think romantic love is a 
concept Hollywood invented to sell 
tickets to Kate Hudson movies.

FREYA
don t... you No48.



it. getting Freya, at looks She  doesn t. She  sighs. Ingrid

INGRID
So who is he?

FREYA
I just meant -- hypothetically.

INGRID
Hypothetically who is he?

FREYA
Hypothetically... Dash s brother.

INGRID
didn t! you Freya,

FREYA
I love Dash!  I do.  So much!  He s 
safe and warm and comforting and 
familiar and hot and funny and 
romantic and sweet and I can 
totally see myself spending the 
rest of my life with him!  And 
then... there s Killian.  I can t 
explain it, but he s like... 
lightning bolt passion crazy 
amazing awesome soulmate sexual 
insanity!
(Ingrid shakes her head)
Stop shaking your head at me!  I 
hate when you shake your head at 
me!  

JOANNA (O.S.)
-Girls, I d like you to meet your 
Aunt Wendy... 

Freya and Ingrid turn to see Joanna and Wendy have entered 
the kitchen.  Freya stands, gives Wendy a warm hug.  

WENDY 
Freya, it s so wonderful to see you 
again... You don t remember me, I m 
sure, but we met a long time ago, 
and we had a lot of fun together...

FREYA
Will you tell me some stories about 
Mom that I can use against her 
later please?49.



WENDY
Oh, I ve got a million.

We notice INGRID, staring at Wendy, stunned.  Ingrid flashes 
on-

THE PHOTO SHE FOUND AT FAIR HAVEN.  OF HER, AND WENDY!  AND 
THE NECKLACE.  WENDY IS WEARING THE SAME NECKLACE!

Ingrid is freaked out.  Wendy smiles at her.

(CONT D) WENDY
Oh, Ingrid.  You look so...

Wendy goes in for a hug, but Ingrid is opening the back door.

INGRID
It s really nice to meet you, but 
I m late for work.  I gotta go.

She rushes out. Joanna turns to Freya.

JOANNA
What was that about?

Freya shrugs.


Ingrid throws a BIG DUSTY BOOK onto the counter, we see the 
title: AN OCCULT HISTORY OF FAIR HAVEN.  She searches through 
the book and finds THAT SAME PHOTO: HER AND WENDY HOLDING 
BROOMS IN FRONT OF FAIR HAVEN.  

Ingrid runs her fingers over it thoughtfully, it SMEARS.  The 
faces smeared out.  She turns her hand over  - WET BLACK INK 
COATS HER FINGERTIPS.  

INGRID
What the hell...?


FREYA and WENDY shop in this quaint little upscale gourmet 
market, pushing a cart around the narrow aisles.

WENDY
So tell me about this boy.  Dash. 

FREYA
He s not a boy, Aunt Wendy.  He s a 
man.  And he s... amazing.    50.



Wendy gives her a knowing look.

WENDY
But...?

FREYA
-But nothing!  He s seriously 
perfect.  I couldn t be happier.

Wendy stops and stares at her, assessing.

WENDY
-Or more conflicted.  You love him.  
That much is clear.  But you re 
tempted by another...

Freya is stunned.

FREYA
Oh my God.  How did you...?

Wendy shrugs, turns and keeps walking.  Freya catches up.

WENDY
Your aura s like twelve different 
colors right now.

FREYA
You can read auras?!

WENDY
Mmm-hmm.  Plus I m very intuitive.  
Especially with other... family 
members.

JOANNA approaches with an armful of produce, throws it in the 
cart, staring at them suspiciously.  Freya is excited.

FREYA
-I can read auras too you know!  Or 
at least -- I can see them.  
Sometimes.  I think. 

Joanna rolls her eyes, gives Wendy a look of warning.

JOANNA
Freya, there s something you should 
know about your Aunt Wendy.  She s 
what people in the psychiatric 
profession call  a flake.   You 
shouldn t listen to anything she 
says. 51.



FREYA
Well I m a flake too, then!  Guess 
it runs in the family.

Freya sticks her tongue out at Joanna and walks on, happy, 
Joanna looks at Wendy, pissed.  She whispers-

JOANNA
What part of no magic do you not 
understand?!

Wendy rolls her eyes, puts her arm around Joanna.

WENDY
Relax.  It s not like I levitated 
by the prepared foods.  We really 
gotta get that broomstick outta 
your ass, babe...

And they walk on.


 the on close We rePAINTING OF THE DESERT again.  We hear the 
same rhythmic CHANTING in an ancient language as before, the 
paint undulating rhythmically as if did before.

EVIL JOANNA (O.S.)
Mysticum flamma aperire pictura... 
mysticum flamma aperire pictura...

We pull back to reveal EVIL JOANNA holding the candle, her 
face MORPHING DEMONIC as she chants, faster and faster until -
- WE HEAR A LOUD THUD.  She looks down and we see, on the 
ground-

-A MAN.  In ragged clothes.  Sunburned, covered in sand.  His 
face full of blisters.  His lips painfully cracked.  His 
breath raspy and dry.  

Evil Joanna kneels beside him, hands him a glass of water, he 
century. a in liquid tasted hasn t who someone like drinks

(CONT D) JOANNA EVIL
If you come with me, I can help you 
get revenge on the witch who did 
this to you...

Off his evil smile-

END OF ACT FOUR52.



ACT FIVE


KILLIAN enters, the place half-full with a dinner crowd 
eating bar food, he sits down at a table.  FREYA walks over 
with a tray.  He grins up at her.  She s annoyed.

FREYA
I figured my not showing up at your 
boat last night would be a hint...

KILLIAN
Yeah well, that s not why I m here, 
conceited!

She laughs, surprised by his playfulness.

(CONT D) KILLIAN
I decided we should be friends.

Freya looks at him skeptically, not buying it.

FREYA
You wanna be friends...

KILLIAN
Well you are marrying my brother, so 
in a way we re practically family.  
We should at least be friends.  Hang 
out, get to know each other... 
Platonically, of course-

FREYA
I don t really think that s such a 
good idea.

KILLIAN
I get it.  You re scared you won t 
be able to keep your hands off me.

FREYA
In your dreams.

KILLIAN
Cool, so we ll be friends, you ll

of your life wondering what it 
would ve been like with me.

FREYA
Sorry, who s the conceited one?

KILLIAN
Well that s what I ll be doing 
anyway.

 be she ll what it s knowing upset, away, hand her pulls Freya
doing too.  Killian smiles at her.

(CONT D) KILLIAN
So, can I get a drink or what, pal?

FREYA
Alright, chill out buddy, I ll go 
make you something!

Freya walks away, Killian watches with longing...

Freya passes the BAR, where the MAN WHO FELL OUT OF THE 
PAINTING (HENCEFORTH KNOWN AS DOUG) sits, nursing a drink, 
watching her with an evil stare...


INGRID shelves books, the place empty.  BARB rushes up, still 
in her pajamas.

INGRID
Where have you been all day?

BARB
Freaking out.

INGRID
Why?

Barb hands Ingrid a PREGNANCY TEST STICK.  IT S POSITIVE.

(CONT D) INGRID
Did you pee on this...?

BARB
(giddy)
Yah-ha!

reels. mind Barb s  out. grossed stick, test the drops Ingrid54.



BARB (CONT D)
I mean, you don t think...

INGRID
-What?  That it was the spell?

BARB
The doctor did say it would take a 
miracle...!

INGRID
Uh, aside from the fact that we got 
it off a website that misspelled 
  fertility  word the bothand the 
word  spell  -- it s way too fast 
for that to have worked-

BARB
But -- isn t that why they call it 
magic?

INGRID
 That s  on. come Barb,insane-

BARB
-All I know is -- yesterday, I 
wasn t pregnant.  And we did that 
spell, and then... Bob and I... you 
know... twice... and I went to 
sleep, and I had a dream.  You were 
there.  You were handing me my 
baby... 

INGRID
But that was just a dream!

BARB
-I know it seems crazy.  But it 
kinda feels true  it? doesn t too, 
Like, if this were a movie, right 
now would be the moment where the 
girl who thought she was ordinary 
finds out that she s actually 
magic, and that the power was 
within her all along! 

 can t She  puke. to wants she like looks reels, mind Ingrid s
believe it, but part of her knows it s true.

INGRID
I have to go.

Ingrid walks away, freaking out.  Barb watches, confused.55.



BARB
Hey!  What are you so upset about?!

But Ingrid just keeps walking, upset.


BULLSEYE!  Freya just threw a perfect dart.  She turns to 
Killian, smug, hands him a shot glass.

KILLIAN
You re kickin  my ass.

He downs the shot, Freya downs one too, grinning, she grabs 
the darts out of the dartboard.

FREYA
Never play darts against a 
bartender.

 it s touch, hands their Killian, to darts the hands She
 an There s  back. pulls She  linger. hands their electric,
awkward moment while they look at each other.  Then-

KILLIAN
See, I for one think this whole 
platonic thing is going great.  It 
all. at torture isn t

Freya just smiles.  It s torture for her too.

FREYA
I have to go to the bathroom.

He nods, she walks past DOUG, still at the bar, watching her, 
biding his time...


Freya puts on lip gloss in the mirror.  Takes a deep breath.

FREYA
I don t care how drunk you are, or 
how hot he is, keep it friendly, 
Freya.  Friendly friends.  Friends 
are friendly and we are friends.  
That s all we are.  Just friends.  
Friends forever.
(singing)
That s what friends are for... 

She uses the lip gloss as a microphone, as the DOOR IS SHOVED 
OPEN BY DOUG.  He locks it behind him.  56.



(CONT D) FREYA
Whoa.  Occupado, buddy.

DOUG
Hello Freya.

Freya looks at him, she s tipsy, but freaked.

FREYA
Hiya... stranger.  You got quite 
the sunburn there.  If I were you, 
I d get some aloe on that, ASAP.

She tries to get past him to the door, he blocks the way.

DOUG
She said you d be different.  That 
you wouldn t remember me.

FREYA
Who said?

DOUG
My benefactor.  She really hates 
your family.  Even more than I do.  
She said I could have you as my 
toy, and I could do whatever I want 
with you... 

Freya looks at him, scared.  He cocks his head, confused.

DOUG (CONT D)
You re not the same Freya, but 
Freya... still you re

FREYA
Um... I think you have me confused 
with a different Freya.  It s a 
very common name...

She tries to get past him again, he stops her.

DOUG
I wanted you to be my bride, and 
you rejected me.  All I did was get 
a little bit angry, and what did 
you do?  You stuck me in a desert 
for eighty years.  Well guess what -
- I m gonna do a lot more than just 
hit you this time.57.



FREYA
(screams)
KILLIAN!  ROGER!  SOMEBODY!


-But even right outside the bathroom door, the music is SO 
LOUD, not to mention all the laughter, glasses clinking, etc, 
that we can barely hear Freya s screams.


Doug grabs Freya by the shoulders, shakes her.  

DOUG
Hey!  Stop it!

FREYA
-Please let me go!

He pulls a KNIFE from his pocket -- shaped like a HALF-MOON 
and covered in ANCIENT SCRIPT.  He places it on her throat, 
pins her to the wall.. 

DOUG
My magic s a little rusty, and I 
was never as talented as you.  
Which is why you re the one who s 
gonna cast the spell.  Take this.

He uses his free hand to grab a LIT CANDLE from the sink, 
shoves it at her, she takes it, confused.

FREYA
We re gonna cast a magic spell with 
a Glade scented candle?

He presses the knife against her throat a little harder.

DOUG
Yes we are.  Now take a deep 
breath, and repeat after me...
(chanting)
Mysticum pictura devorare nos-

FREYA
I don t speak... that-

DOUG
Yes you do!  Say it Freya!  
(chanting)
Mysticum pictura devorare nos...58.



FREYA
(trying to chant)
Mysticum... pictura-

DOUG
-Devorare nos!  Again-

He presses the knife into her neck harder, draws a little 
blood.  Freya shakes, holding the candle.

FREYA
(chanting)
Mysticum pictura, devorare nos...

We pan over their heads, to a PAINTING ON THE WALL -- OF A 
1920S SPEAKEASY... THE BRUSHSTROKES BEGIN TO MOVE AND TWIST 
AND SHIFT LIKE THE DESERT PAINTING DID EARLIER.

FREYA AND DOUG
(chanting)
Mysticum picturea devorare nos...


The twisting paint becomes a bubbling stew on the stove.  
WENDY throws in a DEAD LIZARD, she makes a  yuck  face.  
JOANNA enters.  

WENDY
Hey! I was just making this stew I 
used once to track down an old 
boyfriend who owed me money.  It s 
a vision stew!  I thought we could 
use it to find our imposter -- it 
gives you crazy visions.  Hence the 
name... It s kinda in the peyote 
family so don t be alarmed if the 
walls start breathing... You want a 
taste?

Off Wendy s disbelief-59.




FREYA FALLS TO THE FLOOR of a TWENTIES SPEAKEASY, her head 
hits the ground, she sits herself up, disoriented, the room 
 by surrounded she s spinning,DANCING FLAPPERS AND LOUD 
MUSIC.  She looks around, freaked. 

FREYA
What the hell...?!

She sees DOUG seem to fall from the ceiling, and hit the 
floor nearby.  He scrambles to his feet, coming toward her, 
holding the knife.  

Freya gets up and RUNS IN SLOW MOTION THROUGH THE CROWD.  
DOUG FOLLOWS, DETERMINED, PSYCHOTIC...


 the on We rePAINTING.  We can faintly hear 20s JAZZ MUSIC 
coming from it.  We can also hear KILLIAN KNOCKING on the 
door.  

KILLIAN (O.S.)
Hello?  Freya?  Did you fall in?  

HE FORCES THE DOOR OPEN, looks at the empty bathroom, 
confused as to where Freya went.  Nothing looks amiss.  
Killian shrugs, perplexed, and closes the door.


MAURA THATCHER lays awake in bed, out of her coma.  MATTHEW 
the hot cop is ushered into the room by a DOCTOR.

MATTHEW
I hear you wanted to see me.

Maura nods.

MAURA
I know who killed my husband.

Off Matt, waiting...


JOANNA and INGRID enter through the back door, carrying 
groceries.  WENDY LAYS DYING ON THE FLOOR.  Joanna falls to 
her knees instantly.

JOANNA
Oh my God, what happened?60.



Wendy is weak, bleeding.  She pulls a dish towel away from 
her wound.

WENDY
I think I ruined your towel.

JOANNA
Ingrid, call an ambulance!

Ingrid grabs the phone, dials 911, shaky.

WENDY
She was here... The imposter... I 
managed to eat some stew, after she 
left... I had a vision... oh man 
the walls are breathing.

INGRID
(into phone)
Hello?  I need an ambulance, 417 
Waverly Terrace... Please!  Hurry!

WENDY
You have to save Freya-

JOANNA
-Save her from what?!

WENDY
The Inn where she works.  In the 
bathroom.  There s a painting.  An 
old lover of Freya s wants revenge.  
He s going to take her inside the 
painting, kill her in there, 
because he knows if he does-

Joanna nods, with a sick realization-

JOANNA

watching this, beside herself.

INGRID
What the hell is going on here?!61.



Joanna turns to Ingrid, all business.  

JOANNA
We don t have much time.  We have 
to help your sister.  But first, 
there s something I need to tell 
you.  The truth about who we are.

INGRID
Please don t tell me we re witches-

JOANNA
(overlapping)
witches. -We re

Ingrid sinks into a chair, woozy.

(CONT D) JOANNA
When you were little, I put a spell 
on you girls, so you wouldn t 
figure out what you were.  It 
barely worked on Freya, but it 
worked too well on you...

Ingrid realizes something.

INGRID
She knew.  Freya knew and you lied 
to her... You sent her to therapy!  
Oh my God she is gonna be so pissed-

JOANNA
-Only if we can save her.

INGRID
(shaky)
This isn t happening.  I m a 
rational skeptic.  I m a wallflower-

Joanna grabs Ingrid by the shoulders, looks her in the eye.

JOANNA
-Baby, no: you re magic.  

Ingrid takes a deep ragged breath.  THE DOORBELL RINGS.


Joanna and Ingrid open the door.  MATTHEW, the hot cop, is 
flanked by TWO OTHER COPS.  Ingrid looks at them, confused-

INGRID
I thought I called for an ambulance-62.



Matthew s face is grim.  He looks at Joanna.

MATTHEW
I m sorry to have to do this, 
but... Joanna Beauchamp, you are 
under arrest for the murder of Bill 
Thatcher, and the attempted murder 
of Maura Thatcher.

He cuffs Joanna, reads her her rights.

(CONT D) MATTHEW
You have the right to remain 
silent...

INGRID
Wait -- Matthew, what the hell-

Matthew looks at Ingrid, feeling bad-

MATTHEW
She was positively ID d by the 
sorry- I m victim,

Joanna leans in to Ingrid, whispers frantically-

JOANNA
You have to save your sister!  
You re the only one who can do it!

INGRID
-Please don t tell me the power was 
within me all along-

JOANNA
-There s a drawer, hidden inside 
the breakfront.  You ll find what 
you need inside.  Hurry Ingrid!  
Hurry, please!

Matthew leads Joanna away.  Ingrid watches, distraught. 

 quiet the in there stands Ingrid  alone. she s then, And
house, wondering what the hell she should do.  She nervously 
walks over to the BREAKFRONT.  Stands before it for a beat, 
knowing her world is about to change forever.  SHE TAKES A 
DEEP BREATH, AND OPENS IT-
