  FADE IN:


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  SPARTACUS, reinstated from the Pits, spars with HAMILCAR in 
  a rotating drill with the other GLADIATORS. Bruises and 
  scrapes still mar his flesh, but he trains with focus and 
    determination. DOCTORE cracks his whip.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Switch!

  The Gladiators switch partners. Every man is drenched in 
  sweat, lips cracked from lack of water. The drought has 
  taken its toll. VARRO grins, crossing sword and shield with 
  Spartacus. After a few beats, Doctore cracks his whip.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Switch!

  CRIXUS moves into position opposite Spartacus, attacking. 
  Spartacus tries to keep a steady pace, but Crixus strikes 
  hard, pressing beyond the exercise. Doctore cracks his whip.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Switch!

  GNAEUS, exhausted and winded, moves to face Spartacus -- but 
  Crixus doesn t give way. He continues to press, catching 
  Spartacus by surprise. Spartacus stumbles back, barely 
  deflecting the blows. Crixus raises his practice sword to 
  crack Spartacus' skull.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Crixus!

  Crixus freezes. Doctore steps closer, displeased.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Did you not hear the command?

                                        CRIXUS
                        Apologies, Doctore. I hope I did 
                        not frighten the rabbit.

  Snickers from the men. Doctore glares.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The games of the Magistrate 
                        approach. Listen carefully to my 
                          instructions, and every man chosen 
                        will see victory in the arena.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  Gnaeus swoons from the heat in the background, collapses to 
  the ground.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Perhaps not every man.

  PIETROS rushes over to Gnaeus with a skin of water.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Save rations for men who deserve 
                        them. Spartacus! Varro! Remove him 
                      to the infirmary.

  Spartacus and Varro carry Gnaeus out of the square. Doctore 
  cracks his whip, commanding the rest of the men to continue.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Resume!


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  Spartacus and Varro dump Gnaeus on an examining table. The 
  MEDICUS comes over as Spartacus and Varro move away.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      We nearly die of thirst and yet 
                        water is withheld.

                                        VARRO
                        Batiatus lacks the coin to purchase 
                        more than a few drops. Especially 
                        since losing a fortune in the Pits.

  Spartacus darkens with guilt.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Because of me.

                                        VARRO
                        You did what you had to. If you had 
                        died as promised, Batiatus' purse 
                        would be overflowing, but the man 
                        himself dead. And no one to find 
                        your wife.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And if he does, how will I pay to 
                        wrest her from the Syrian? I have 
                      no coin, nor favor in the arena.

                                        VARRO
                        The gods will provide.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I place no value in them.

                                        VARRO
                        Perhaps now's a good time to start.

  Varro grins as he moves off. Spartacus frowns, following, 
  his body WIPING US TO --


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY

  BATIATUS stands in the middle of his empty reflecting pool, 
  his arms outstretched to the blazing sky above. Several 
  SLAVES stand in the background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Rain! By Jupiter's cock, will you 
                        fucking rain!

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

  Batiatus turns to find LUCRETIA striding up with a scroll in 
  hand. NAEVIA hustles in her wake.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Praying.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Blaspheming.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The two are narrowly separated in 
                        these trying times.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Perhaps the gap widens...

  She holds out the scroll. Batiatus steps out of the pool, 
  takes it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        More creditors, threatening action?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Something of more cheerful note, 
                        just delivered...

  Lucretia beams, barely containing herself as Batiatus scans 
  the message. Batiatus brightens.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

                                        BATIATUS
                        From Magistrate Calavius! He's 
                        coming here to personally select 
                        men for his games!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Games to appease the gods and end 
                        the drought! The biggest games 
                        since Theokoles bested a hundred 
                        men in the arena!

                                        BATIATUS
                        But why come himself? Unless...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The Primus.

                                        BATIATUS
                      To secure the main event at these 
                        games... We would be the talk of 
                        the Republic.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He arrives within the hour.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Slaves)(
                        Prepare food. And gather all the 
                        water we have.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Your robe...

  Lucretia goes to Batiatus, concerned. He glances down to see 
  BLOOD has seeped through the side of his robe where the 
  assassin slashed him in 104.

                                        BATIATUS
                        It's nothing.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                to Naevia)(
                        Fetch the Medicus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Lucretia --

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would have word with the 
                        Magistrate about this. Those men 
                        nearly killed you, an honest 
                        citizen.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                      In a dishonest place. No, we won't 
                        concern the Magistrate with such 
                        things, not with the Primus in the 
                        balance. I'll tend to the matter 
                        myself.

  OFF Batiatus, darkening at the thought...


  EXT. MARKET ALLEY - CAPUA - DAY

  THUMP! A CHUNK OF FLESH lands on a table at a market stall. 
  It's the rotted, decaying, maggoty shoulder of one of the 
  assassins from 104, bearing the distinct BRAND. The flesh 
  was just tossed by

  ASHUR,

  who glares at MARCELLUS, a greasy merchant of questionable 
  repute. BARCA looms behind Marcellus, face filled with 
  impending violence.

                                        ASHUR
                        That was the mark on one of the 
                        slaves who tried to kill Batiatus. 
                        Who is the master?

  Marcellus glances at it in disgust.

                                          MARCELLUS
                        The mark is unknown to me.

                                        ASHUR
                        Perhaps a closer look...

  Barca slams Marcellus' face into the maggoty flesh, holds it 
  there.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Details of such craftsmanship 
                        should not be viewed in haste.

                                          MARCELLUS
                                  spitting maggots)(
                        I...may have seen a similar mark...

  OFF Ashur's murderous grin...


  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY

  Lucretia finishes helping Batiatus into his finest robes.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                      Do they yet fit? They feel as if 
                        they've shrunk about the middle.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You adorn them like a god.

                        I would be out of them... and deep 
                        into you...

  He kisses her. She laughs, but can't help feel the passion 
  rising as his hand slips down between her legs. Naevia 
  enters, breaking the moment.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Apologies. Magistrate Calavius 
                        arrives.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Our fortunes rise, along with your 
                        cock.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Stay wet. I'll make it rain 
                        presently...

  As they sweep out...


  INT. ATRIUM/TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY

  Batiatus and Lucretia enter, beaming. MAGISTRATE TITUS 
  CALAVIUS stands with his back to them, speaking with someone 
  we can't see. Calavius' GUARDS wait in the background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Magistrate! You honor us with your 
                        presence!

  Calavius turns. Batiatus' smile falters as he sees the man 
  the Magistrate was conversing with: SOLONIUS, his rival.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Good Batiatus! I was just telling 
                        Solonius how I knew your father. 
                        Now there was a true Roman.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A great man, none of his like to 
                        follow.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.
  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus smiles through the obvious slight, bowing slightly 
  to Calavius.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I shall attempt to fill your needs 
                      as he would have.

  Batiatus motions them towards the triclinium, filled with 
  food and water. They talk as they stroll.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      To business then. As you well know, 
                        the drought has parched the city to 
                        near madness. We've tried 
                        everything to tempt the sky to 
                        tears, even the Hecatombe.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A hundred cattle sacrificed, and 
                        yet not a drop.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Because the gods do not want the 
                        blood of bulls. They want the blood 
                      of men! Good Solonius has been kind 
                        enough to lend hand in organizing 
                        games to appease their appetite.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      It will be a Sine Missione. No 
                        draw. No mercy shown.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Only the finest gladiators will be 
                        invited to participate.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Only the finest are offered in the 
                        house of Batiatus. Come, examine my 
                        wares. And marvel at their 
                        superiority.

  Batiatus shoots Solonius a wry grin as he motions them out 
  to the balcony.


  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - DAY

  Calavius and Solonius step out onto the balcony. Batiatus 
  and Lucretia follow, with Naevia ever in tow. Doctore 
  continues putting the men through their paces beneath the 
  setting sun in the square below.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.
  CONTINUED:

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      An impressive selection, rivaling 
                        that of good Solonius himself.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        And yet I hold the Primus.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Half. Your opponent still to be 
                        chosen.

  Batiatus shares an excited look with Lucretia.

                                        BATIATUS
                      If you hope to appease the gods, 
                        you must have one upon the sands! 
                        Crixus, the Champion of Capua!

  Batiatus indicates Crixus, sparring with Hamilcar, muscles 
  rippling in the light of the setting sun.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      He will gladly meet anyone Solonius 
                        has to offer.

  Solonius' face splits into a grin. Exactly what he wanted to 
  hear.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Excellent! It will truly be a 
                        contest between legends!

                                        BATIATUS
                        Legends?

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Did I fail to mention? Good 
                        Solonius has secured Theokoles for 
                        the Primus!

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  stunned)(
                        Theokoles?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I managed to coax him to our fair 
                        city, at great expense.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        With our gratitude.  If the gods 
                        fail to grant us rain for such a 
                        tribute, then we are surely cursed.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    9.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I fear the gods will be displeased. 
                        The match is unbalanced. Only one 
                        man has ever stood against 
                        Theokoles and lived.

  Solonius looks down at Spartacus as he trains below.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        What if Crixus were joined by your 
                        man Spartacus? His death was fated 
                      in execution, yet he refused to own 
                        it. And cost me four men in its 
                        defiance.

  Batiatus struggles to find an honorable way to back out.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Your debts are well known, 
                        Batiatus. Even if you lose the men, 
                        the purse is enough to hold your 
                        creditors at bay, for a moment. Of 
                        course if you'd prefer to sit out 
                        these games, and others to 
                        follow...

                                        BATIATUS
                        No. I will set my men to the task.

  Lucretia stiffens in shock. Solonius grins in satisfaction. 
  Batiatus glares at him as he steps to the railing and 
  addresses his men.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      My titans! Pause, and hear glorious 
                        news!

  Spartacus, Crixus, and the other men look to Batiatus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Magistrate Titus Calavius has 
                        invited our best men to fight in 
                        his Primus! Crixus! Step forward!

  Crixus grins as he proudly steps forward. Of course he was 
  asked to fight. For a moment, his eyes meet Naevia's on the 
  balcony above. She quickly looks away.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Spartacus! Step forward.

  A murmur of surprise ripples through the Gladiators. Crixus 
  glares as Spartacus steps forward, equally surprised.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        You have both been chosen. You will 
                        fight as one... against Theokoles, 
                        the Shadow of Death!

  The men react in shock and excitement. PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS 
  as the weight of the matter settles upon him...


  INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Crixus glares at Spartacus as he eats his evening gruel. 
  Varro frowns as he passes by with Spartacus.

                                        VARRO
                        You two will make a fine couple.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would rather fight without him.

                                        VARRO
                        And die the same.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        This Theokoles. The legends cannot 
                      be true.

                                        VARRO
                      He has been cut a thousand times in 
                        the arena, and has never fallen. I 
                        fear you would have been safer in 
                        the Pits.

  They sit to eat. Spartacus eyes Crixus across the mess hall, 
  considering their chances.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      If we were to win, how large would 
                      be the purse?

                                        VARRO
                        Large enough to wrest ten wives 
                        from the Syrian.

  OFF Spartacus, eyeing Crixus as he considers the 
    possibilities...


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Doctore follows Batiatus as he fumes, Lucretia at his side.

                      An excellent suggestion.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I owe Theokoles a debt of pain.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You were not requested!

  Batiatus softens.

                      No one has forgotten how bravely 
                        you fought against Theokoles, old 
                        friend.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Yet without victory.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You stand the only man ever to face 
                        him in the arena and live. That in 
                        itself is victory.

  Batiatus sees Ashur and Barca approaching.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Set your purpose on training Crixus 
                        and Spartacus for the match.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I fear no amount will keep them 
                        from the Shadow's grasp.

                        Then prepare them for a glorious 
                        death.

  Batiatus motions for Ashur and Barca to follow him. OFF 
  Lucretia, concern for Crixus welling in her eyes...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Ashur and Barca follow Batiatus into his office chamber.

  INT. STORAGE AREA/MESS HALL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON a skin of water being passed through the bars of 
  the gate separating the mess hall from the storage area 
  leading up to the villa.

  POP WIDE to reveal Naevia on the other side of the gate.

                        From the Domina.  To help with your 
                        training.

  She turns to go.

                        Does there need to be one?

  She takes him in, uncertain of how she feels towards the 
  man... but feeling nonetheless.  He takes her in with 
  longing -- and something very much approaching love.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

  She locks eyes with him, the air charged between them.  With

  She quietly slips back up the stairs to the ludus.  OFF 



  INT. CORRIDOR/CRIXUS' CELL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Crixus returns from the baths wrapped in a towel.  He steps 
  into his cell and freezes, tensing.  Spartacus sits half in 
  the shadows on his bed.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I seek no quarrel.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your presence states otherwise.

  Spartacus rises.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      We have had our differences. I own 
                      my part in them. Yet if we are to 
                        defeat Theokoles --

                                        CRIXUS
                        We?
                                  laughs)(
                        There is no such thing in the 
                        arena. Only the Champion of Capua. 
                        And a Thracian dog undeserving the 
                        name of gladiator.

  Spartacus' jaw tightens.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You believe you can slay the giant? 
                        Alone?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        This time you do not.

                                        CRIXUS
                      If Theokoles falls, the glory will 
                      be mine.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And if we do not come to common 
                        ground, the death shared will be 
                        ours.

  Spartacus exits. OFF Crixus, considering his words... and 
  not caring for them.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAWN

  The MORNING SUN blazes as Ashur hobbles along with Barca 
  towards the main gate, accompanied by TWO GUARDS. Ashur 
  snorts at Spartacus and Crixus warming in the square, 
  separate and far from a team.

                                        ASHUR
                      As if they stand chance against 
                        Theokoles.

                                        BARCA
                        Perhaps the gods will favor them.

                                        ASHUR
                        And perhaps I shall sprout wings 
                        and flutter off. The odds lay a 
                        thousand to one against them.

  Barca eyes Crixus across the square.

                                        BARCA
                      No man has ever won betting against 
                        Crixus. I would lay coin towards 
                        their victory.

                                        ASHUR
                        A fool's wager, happily received.

  Ashur hobbles off. Barca glares after him, nods to the 
  GUARDS to unlock the gate. Pietros hustles up.

                                          PIETROS
                        You leave without words.

                        man!

  Pietros registers hurt. Barca softens.

                                          BARCA(cont'd)
                        I do what I must, Pietros. I'll 
                        return soon. Mind the birds.

  He kisses Pietros softly, exits. Doctore enters the square, 
  calls for Pietros.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Pietros! Weapons!

  Pietros hustles over to the weapons barrel. Gnaeus, looking 
  pale and dehydrated, gives the boy a leering grin with 
  cracked lips. Pietros ignores him, drawing two practice 
  swords. He hustles the weapons PAST FRAME, WIPING US TO --


  INT. ATRIUM/TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY

  Batiatus follows Lucretia as she strides through the atrium. 
  Naevia follows.

                        Now isn't the time to be 
                        entertaining that spoiled little 
                        bitch.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Now is the perfect time. Her father 
                        Albinius holds the Magistrate's 
                        ear. If he were to place a word in 
                        it, perhaps Crixus could be 
                        replaced in the Primus.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

  Lucretia whirls on him, her frustration boiling over.

                        Solonius maneuvered you.

                        Refuse and we would quickly find 
                        ourselves excluded from the arena 
                        altogether.

                        And if Crixus falls? Who will be 
                        our champion? Who will the crowds 
                        clamor to see from the house of 
                        Batiatus? Spartacus, the thing from 
                        the Pits?

  ILITHYIA enters from the far side of the atrium, escorted in 
  by Batiatus' Guards. Several BODY SLAVES are in tow.

  Batiatus moves off, his gracious smile dropping into an 
  annoyed frown once his back is turned. Lucretia leads 
  Ilithyia to the triclinium.

  TIGHT ON SPARTACUS as a wooden practice sword cracks him in 
  the face. Blood erupts from his mouth. POP WIDE to reveal

  DOCTORE

  schooling Spartacus and Crixus with two practice swords. 
  Spartacus slams to the ground, stunned by the blow. Crixus 
  rushes Doctore. Doctore counters with lightning speed, 
  cracking Crixus repeatedly before kicking him to the ground. 
  Ashur, watching with a few other men, stifles a laugh.

                        You attack as you would a man. 
                        Theokoles is beyond flesh. Beyond 
                        blood and bone. He is the shadow 
                        that precedes death. Allow it to 
                        fall upon you alone... and you are 
                        lost. Rise, and come at me as one!

  Spartacus glances at Crixus. Crixus glares, turns away as he 
  rises and attacks. ARM UP to find

  LUCRETIA AND ILITHYIA

  downs a cup of water, holds it out for Naevia for more. 
  Naevia looks to Lucretia, who reluctantly nods the go-ahead.

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Doctore whirls and spins, fluidly countering every attack 
  from Spartacus and Crixus. Crixus and Spartacus move to 
  attack simultaneously, but only succeed in getting in each 
  other's way. Crixus snarls.

                        The advantage was mine!

  Doctore uses the distraction to attack, dropping both men to 
  the ground again.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You jostle and trip over the other 
                        like fools. You face Theokoles in

                        worthy!

  Spartacus and Crixus comply, rising to engage Doctore again.

                        You know her?

                      In passing. She has a young boy.

                        And would have none, if not touched 
                      by the woman I speak of. Will you 
                        let me arrange it? As a gift for 
                        your hospitality?

  Lucretia hesitates, nods uncomfortably. Ilithyia squeals, 
  kissing her impulsively, innocently.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)

                        The very best.

  Ilithyia beams, turning back to the square. Lucretia eyes 
  her for a moment, not feeling friendly in the least, before 
  shifting her gaze to

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Sweat and grime stain Crixus and Spartacus as they battle 
  Doctore. Still unable to work as one, Doctore once again 
  smashes each painfully to the ground. He stares down at 
  them.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Pathetic.

  He turns away in disgust, WIPING US TO --


  INT. BATHS - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  The bath is sparsely populated by GLADIATORS. Spartacus and 
  Crixus stand apart as SLAVES scrape the dirt and blood caked 
  to their battered bodies. A beat. Spartacus addresses Crixus 
  without looking at him.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        How are we to fare against 
                        Theokoles, when we cannot even best 
                        Doctore?

                                        CRIXUS
                        I could have had him a dozen times, 
                      if you had not gotten underfoot.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I take the sands beside you in this 
                        fight, Crixus.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Just because you stand near me with 
                        sword and shield, do not mistake 
                        yourself a gladiator. You fight to 
                        leave these walls. I fight to honor 
                        them.

  Grunts of approval from the men.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You fight... because you are a 
                        slave. Like me.

  Crixus moves closer, his smile never wavering.

                                        CRIXUS
                        No. Not like you. I accept my life 
                        here. I embrace it. But you... you 
                        still dream of a life beyond the 
                        arena. Where that wife of yours

                        all it is, Spartacus. A dream. One 
                        day soon you will awaken to the 
                        truth. You are never leaving this 
                        place. And your woman is either 
                        dead, or fucked to madness by a 
                        hundred Roman cocks --

  WHAM! Spartacus CLOCKS Crixus. Crixus snarls and TACKLES him 
  to the ground, pounding on him. The men erupt in laughter 
  and cheers. Suddenly two GIANT ARMS coil around Crixus' 
  neck, hauling him up. It's Doctore, pulling them apart. The 
  men go quiet. Doctore releases Crixus.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Clean yourselves up. Domina 
                        requests your presence. Both of 
                        you.

  OFF Spartacus, seething as the BACKGROUND shifts, 
    TRANSITIONING US TO --


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Spartacus and Crixus stand before Ilithyia wearing only the 
  subligaria (loincloth), their hands bound in chains. 
  Lucretia hovers nearby. Naevia, Ilithyia's Body Slaves, and 
  two Guards are in the background. Ilithyia eyes Spartacus, a 
  faint, displeased smile tugging at her lips.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      Do you know who I am, Thracian?

  Spartacus ignores her.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Speak.

  A beat. Spartacus shifts his gaze to face her.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I have seen you. With Legatus

                        I am his wife. He is regrettably 
                        abroad, and will not be able to 
                        witness your death against 
                        Theokoles.

  She moves in closer, her hand touching his chest as her lips

                        But I shall whisper of it to him, 
                        replaying the moment when we are 
                        intwined in our bed.

                        Apologies.

  Ilithyia turns to see Batiatus has entered.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I require the Thracian for a 
                        moment.

                        Extend it by a lifetime. I am done 
                        with him.

  Batiatus motions to a Guard, who escorts Spartacus out. 
  Spartacus glances back at Ilithyia, murder flashing in his 
  eyes.

  Lucretia hides her displeasure as Crixus complies. Naevia 
  can't help but steal a furtive glance before quickly 
  averting her eyes. Ilithyia, however, has no qualms, staring 
  directly at the blazing sun.

                                        ILITHYIA

  Batiatus bows slightly, exits. Ilithyia circles Crixus. Lust 
  fills her eyes as her fingers trace his skin.

                        that every man were carved so...

  Lucretia doesn't care for her pet to be stroked by another 
  hand.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      We must not keep him too long. He 
                        continues his training at first 
                        light.

                      Do you think he will survive, 
                        against the Shadow?

  Lucretia looks to Crixus, worry seizing her.

                        Only the gods hold the answer.

                      It would be pity to see such a man 
                        marred.

  Lucretia senses an opportunity, takes it regardless of 
  Batiatus' warning not to broach the subject.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        There may be a way to avoid such 
                        tragedy. A word from your father to 
                        the Magistrate, perhaps...

  Ilithyia cocks her head, not understanding.

  Crixus tenses, shooting her a surprised look. Ilithyia 
  giggles, considering Crixus.

                      Is that what you want? Do you fear 
                        entering the arena with Theokoles?

                                        CRIXUS
                        No. I long for it.

    evaporated...

                                  Spartacus)
                        Remove him to the barracks.

  Batiatus sweeps out with Ashur. OFF Spartacus, considering 
  his words...


  INT. HOLDING CELL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Batiatus, dagger on his belt, enters with Ashur. REMUS, the 
  slave trader, sits bound to a chair in the center of the 
  cell. Unconscious. Blood trickling from a busted lip. Barca 
  looms behind him in the shadows.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Wake him.

  Barca roughly slaps Remus. The man coughs, sputters blood.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Two slaves, broken by your hand, 
                        made attempt on my life. Who 
                        purchased them?

                                        REMUS
                        I know not... what you speak...

                                        BATIATUS
                        I speak of being fucked. By the 
                        gods, by the Magistrate, by that 
                        cock shit Solonius and his grinning 
                        schemes! I am of a proud family! A

                        family of means and history, you 
                        fucking cunt!

  Batiatus loses his shit, repeatedly SMASHES Remus in the 
  face with his ring-encrusted hand as he rants.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You sold the men! Common slaves, 
                        sent to fuck me like a whore!  The 
                        gods tear the world down, but I 
                        will not be fucked! I! WILL! NOT! 
                        BE! FUCKED!

  Batiatus catches his breath, blood DRIPPING from his rings. 
  Remus' face is a brutal display of raw, bleeding flesh. He 
  spits blood and teeth, finally croaking a name.

                                        REMUS
                                  a whisper)(

                        What?

                                        REMUS

                                  a beat)(
                        Was that so difficult?

  Batiatus smiles warmly -- then pulls his dagger and SLITS 
  Remus' throat. As he dies a slow, blood gurgling death...

                                        ASHUR
                                  concerned)(
                        Ovidius is cousin to the

                      He could be cousin to Jupiter 
                        himself, I give no shit. I will 
                        have satisfaction.

  Batiatus sweeps out, WIPING US TO --


  INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  Crixus strides past in all his glory, glaring at Spartacus 
  as he passes. Varro, finishing his meager morning meal next 
  to Spartacus, frowns.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

                                        VARRO
                      So it goes well, then.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The man is no friend to reason.

                                        VARRO
                        Then find means to acquaint him. I 
                        tend to cry when the people close 
                      to me pass. It would be an 
                          embarrassment for the men to see me 
                        weep over your mangled body.

  Varro rises with his empty bowl. Ashur hobbles up as he 
  moves off.

                                        ASHUR
                        A word of advice, Spartacus.

  Spartacus frowns, neither trusting nor caring for the man.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      At what cost?

                                        ASHUR
                        Freely given. Do not think you can 
                        come to terms with Crixus. I 
                        trusted him once in the arena. With 
                        unfortunate result.

  Ashur glances at his crippled leg, the memory of the 
  betrayal fresh. Spartacus glances over to Crixus, where he 
  laughs with Barca.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He would turn his sword against his 
                        ally?

                                        ASHUR
                        Even Barca, if he stood between him 
                        and glory. The only way to survive 
                        against Theokoles is to consider 
                        Crixus equal enemy.

  Ashur hobbles away. Spartacus shifts his attention to 
  Crixus, his eyes narrowing. OFF Crixus, catching the look 
  and returning it with an unpleasant smile...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - EVENING

  The sun hangs low on the horizon. TIGHT ON Spartacus as he 
  hits the ground hard, his face bloodied. POP WIDE to reveal 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

  Crixus laid out nearby. Doctore stands over them, twin 
  practice swords in hand.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You dishonor me.

  Spartacus and Crixus, exhausted and drenched with sweat, 
  painfully rise to their feet.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The Thracian impedes my attack.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I seek to strengthen it.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I need no aid.

                                          DOCTORE
                        No, you need the gods to descend 
                        and fight by your side! And even 
                        then victory is doubtful.
                                    frustrated)(
                        Words, falling upon deaf ears.

  Doctore throws his swords at his feet, sticking them in the 
  sand.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Attend your eyes, then...

  Doctore unlatches his breast plate.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Let them drink deep the pain that 
                        awaits you.

  He lets the breast plate fall to the ground, revealing the 
  horrible scars he carries from his encounter with Theokoles. 
  Spartacus and Crixus take them in with shock.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                      My failure. Your lesson.

  Doctore indicates a mottled SCAR that snakes from his chest 
  down to his abdomen.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        His first cut...                                                                                    29.


  EXT. ARENA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  A SWORD slices across Doctore's stomach and chest. He 
  stiffens in agony, FRAME FREEZING as the blood continues to 
  splatter. (NOTE: In all the FLASHBACKS, we will never see 
  Theokoles, only the giant's blade. He will not be revealed 
  until he enters the arena against Spartacus and Crixus.)


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - EVENING

  Doctore stalks around Spartacus and Crixus.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Dealt when I thought him 
                        vulnerable, and pressed my attack 
                        unwisely.

  Doctore shoots Crixus a withering look.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        His next assault came when I fell 
                        back to regain position....


  EXT. ARENA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  Theokoles' sword tears open Doctore's back. He screams, the 
  FRAME FREEZING as the blood continues to splatter.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - EVENING

  Spartacus eyes the ugly SCAR creasing Doctore's back as he 
  continues circling.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Yet these wounds are nothing. A 
                        game of blood, to amuse the crowd. 
                        And when he tires of playing, he 
                        will move to part head from your 
                        neck...


  EXT. ARENA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  Doctore bends out of the way as a SWORD almost decapitates 
  him. The blade catches Doctore across the face, ripping open 
  his flesh in a gush of blood. FREEZE FRAME on Doctore as the 
  blood splatters, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    30.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - EVENING

  Doctore glares at Spartacus and Crixus, the SCAR marring his 
  face a harbinger of what awaits them.

                        longer than any man who ever stood 
                        against him. Some herald that as a

                        two.

  Doctore retrieves his swords.

                        Show me the way to honor.

  Spartacus glances at Crixus, steeling himself. Crixus grits 
  his teeth and attacks. As Spartacus follows to engage 
  Doctore, we MOVE OFF of the action to --

  He exits into the villa. OFF Lucretia, her eyes falling on 
  Crixus as she prays for a different miracle...

                        Never.

  The Priestess nods, choosing an herb from a wide assortment 
  to add to the chalice.

                                          PRIESTESS
                        Have there been other men, besides

                        What bearing does that have?

  Lucretia shoots an uncomfortable glance towards Ilithyia.

                      It will inform the correct

                        The ritual is usually a private 
                        matter. Perhaps --

                      Oh please, can I stay? I've never 
                        seen one of these. It's so 
                        intriguing.

  Lucretia musters a smile, nods.

                                          PRIESTESS
                        Other men? Have there been any?

                        Yes.

  Ilithyia stifles a shocked giggle. The Priestess pours 
  goat's milk into the chalice.

                                          PRIESTESS
                        How many?

                        One. Frequently.

  Ilithyia chews her lower lip, eyes dancing at the 
    salaciousness of the revelation. The Priestess chooses a 
  Pyramidal Orchid (Anacamptis Pyramidalis), about twelve 
  inches long, its bulbs exposed.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

                        the  seed, but within the vessel.

                        You mean there's something wrong 
                        with her?

  The question is innocent, but Lucretia still feels the sting 
  of it.

                                          PRIESTESS
                        The gods have decided to withhold 
                        the joy of children. We will 
                        entreat them to reconsider...

  The Priestess culls a bulb from the orchid, kisses it, dips 
  it into the goat's milk.

                        Drink.

  Lucretia reluctantly takes the concoction. The Priestess 
  mutters a silent prayer as Lucretia drains the chalice.

                                          PRIESTESS(cont'd)
                        Juno has blessed you. You must

                        Good fortune to you.

  Naevia escorts the Priestess out. Ilithyia rises.

                        Only an hour? You think she would

  She kisses Lucretia and exits with a giggle. Lucretia's eyes 
  drop to the fertility candle. PUSH IN on its flame as it 
  DISSOLVES into a TORCH, TRANSITIONING US TO --


  INT. BATHS - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  A TORCH illuminates the oily walls of the bath. PULL BACK to 
  reveal Crixus once again scraping the dirt and blood off his 
  flesh. Spartacus sits engaged in the same. They scrape in 
  silence. A long beat passes, then:

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You were right.

  Crixus glances over.

                        I do not honor these walls.

                        you were first brought here, 
                        against your will? Your life traded 
                        for a few coins?

                                        CRIXUS
                        More than a few.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Is that your worth, then?

  A beat.

                        Have you not wondered why the great

                        fight for?

  Crixus ponders the weight of Spartacus' words. A Guard 
  enters, interrupting the moment.

                                        GUARD

  Crixus rises, following the Guard. OFF Spartacus watching 
  him go, knowing he's failed to reach him...


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Lucretia stands waiting in a gorgeous see-through gown, her 
  body silhouetted by the flame of the fertility candle. 
  Naevia appears, escorting Crixus.  She lingers outside the 
  bedroom as he enters, Spartacus' words still lingering.

  Crixus complies. Lucretia drinks him in.

  Crixus goes to her. She kisses him hungrily, her hand 
  feeling the electric sting of his body as it moves down his 
  chiseled chest. It dips out of frame to grip his manhood and

  Her lips kiss his neck, her tongue plying his skin with 
  sensual enticement. Naevia watches from the shadows for a 
  moment, then averts her eyes as a flood of conflicting 
  emotions wash over her.

  something there she has never witnessed: doubt. Tears well

  INT. OVIDIUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  OVIDIUS, the grain merchant who hired the assassins to kill 
  Batiatus (in Episode 104), returns to a dark and quiet home.

  Ovidius enters the triclinium and freezes. His wife LAELIA 
  and several SLAVES lay dead in pools of blood on the floor.

  BATIATUS

  sits half in the shadows, his hand tenderly resting on 
  Ovidius' terrified eight-year-old SON's shoulder.

                                        BATIATUS

                        have come to repay.

  Ovidius looks to his petrified Son.

                        Two slaves, hired from the cunt 
                        Remus to take my life. You deny

                        I hired the men, yes. But to 
                        another's purpose.

  Batiatus considers that, turning it in his mind.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Who?

  Ovidius hesitates.

                        Speak the name, and I swear to the 
                        gods I will not kill you.

  Ovidius glances at his son, swallows hard.

                        Solonius.

  Batiatus' eyes narrow in cold fury.

                      He paid the balance of your debt to 
                      me threefold. In exchange for 
                        arranging your death.

  Batiatus stands with a warm smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Gratitude for your honesty, 
                        Ovidius.

  Ovidius laughs in nervous relief.

                        You're not going to kill me, then?

  INT. STORAGE AREA/MESS HALL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Naevia escorts Crixus down the stairs leading to the storage 
  area adjacent to the mess hall. As they reach the landing, 
  she pauses, breaking the silence with a whisper.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You're going to die tomorrow. 
                        Aren't you?

  Crixus sees the fear in her eyes. And something else.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Only the gods divine the future.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Why didn't you let Ilithyia help 
                        you? She could have spoken to her 
                        father --

                                        CRIXUS
                      To what end? Disgrace?

                                        NAEVIA
                        Honor and glory. That's all you 
                        care about, isn't it?

                                        CRIXUS
                        No. Not all.

  He gently touches her cheek. Her heart seizes in her chest.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Still the fool.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Still.

  He leans down and softly kisses her.  Tears stain her cheeks 
  as she returns it.  Passion rises, born of the desperate 
  moment.  He pulls her into the shadows, his hand moving up 
  her thigh, lifting her dress.  Naevia stops him.

                                        NAEVIA

                      Or it can fill him with hope, in 
                        the proper arms...

  He kisses her again.  She takes his hand and moves it back 
  to her thigh.  He lifts her dress.  She gasps as he slips 
  inside her.  MOVE OFF of them to find a GUARD passing on the 
  other side of the gate, unaware of their presence as he

  INT. BARRACKS - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus sits awake in the barracks, Sura's binding 
  considered between his fingers.

                        The odds do not favor you.

  Spartacus glances over to find Varro still not yet asleep.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        They seldom do.

                                        VARRO
                        I've heard Barca has laid a large 
                        amount of coin on you.  Well, more 
                        towards Crixus, but still...

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And you?

                                        VARRO
                      If I had the means, I would wager 
                        all with Barca. You're too fucking 
                        stubborn to die.

  Spartacus can't help but chuckle at that.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And yet every man has his end.

                        I pray to the gods you have not yet 
                        reached yours.

                        a thing of you.

  Varro's eyes shift to Sura's binding.

                                        VARRO
                        Your wife?

  Spartacus nods, emotion blocking further words.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        I will do everything I can to find 
                        her. Now sleep. Tomorrow you face a 
                        legend. And may yet become one 
                        yourself.

  Varro closes his eyes. PUSH IN on Spartacus as he brings the 
  binding close to his lips, lost in thought, sleep denied 
  him... PRE-LAP: The ROAR of the CROWD and the CLASH OF 
  SWORDS rises to a deafening pitch...


  EXT. ARENA - SUNSET

  WHAM! TIGHT ON A GLADIATOR with blood spewing from his 
  mangled face shield as he hits the ground, twitches, lies 
  forever still. POP WIDE to reveal his opponent (Hoplomachus) 
  raise his gory spear in victory. The CROWD roars.

  THE PULVINUS

  Naevia and other SLAVES attend with water and wine, fanning 
  the PATRICIANS crowding the Pulvinus. Batiatus and Lucretia 
  sit with Ilithyia. Solonius and several DIGNITARIES converse 
  further down. The Magistrate's wife DOMITIA occupies the 
  center with her excited 14-year-old son NUMERIUS. The 
    Magistrate's seat is currently empty.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Did you see?! Septimus the victor, 
                      as I said! Valarius always drops 
                        his shield when he attacks, a 
                        disadvantage against the spear.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The boy has a keen eye.

                                          DOMITIA
                        Towards gladiators, yes. His 
                        studies are another matter.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.
  CONTINUED:

  Numerius scowls. Down in the arena, the dead Gladiator is 
  dragged from the sand by the LIBITINARII.

  A PAINTED FIGURE OF CERES,

  the Goddess of Harvest and Renewal, is carried in and 
  paraded around to the CHEERS of the sweat-soaked crowd.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Finally, the Primus. Another moment 
                        and my tongue would turn to dust.

  Lucretia motions to Naevia to bring Ilithyia water.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Water.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Apologies, Domina. We have used our 
                        last.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Please. Share a bit of mine.

  Solonius waves one of his Slaves over to fill her cup. 
  Batiatus forces a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are too kind, good Solonius.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You'd do the same, if you were 
                        able. No matter. Soon Theokoles 
                        will honor the gods with blood, and 
                        they in turn will bless us with 
                        endless rain.

  Magistrate Calavius enters, obviously upset as he takes his 
  seat.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        I pray for the truth in it. The 
                        drought is driving the city mad! 
                        Unfortunate word has reached us 
                        that our dearest cousin Ovidius was 
                        murdered in his home.

  Everyone is shocked. Solonius stiffens.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Ovidius?

                        Their villa was burned, only a few 
                        bodies yet recovered. I fear the 
                        boy among the ruins.

                        A tragedy. One can not but wonder 
                        what would prompt such an act.

  Batiatus shoots Solonius a look. Solonius isn't sure what to 
  make of it, shifts uncomfortably.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Let us turn our minds to hopes of 
                        rain, to cool the fevered brow of 
                        our city.

  He steps forward to address the crowd, who ROAR their 
  approval.

  INT. CHUTES - ARENA - SUNSET

  The Magistrate's VOICE echoes in the background.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS (O.S.)
                      In the name of my forefathers, I, 
                        Titus Calavius, bestow unto you, 
                        the final event! In the tradition 
                      of gladiatorial combat, a spectacle 
                      of blood and death, a sacrifice to 
                        Ceres, the great goddess of 
                        renewal! May she wet our lands with 
                        her lips and shower us with an 
                        ocean of rain!

  Spartacus tightens Sura's binding around his wrist. Crixus 
  stands ready, muscles coiled like steel. Doctore looks out 
  through the gate across the arena, remembering that day 
  years ago when he was set against the Shadow.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                        fucking son of a whore.

  Doctore moves away from the gate. Crixus and Spartacus step 
  forward. A beat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your woman.  She's the reason you 
                        refuse to die?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She is.

  Crixus looks out across the arena, his eyes finding Naevia 
  in the pulvinus.  A beat before he responds to Spartacus, 
  not looking at the man.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Perhaps there is something beyond 
                        glory after all.

  Spartacus glances at Crixus in surprise. Has common ground 
  just been found? TRUMPETS sound. Crixus pulls on his 
  polished helmet. Spartacus follows suit. The gate grinds 
  open. Spartacus and Crixus are handed their swords and 
  shields.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS (O.S.)
                        From the house of Quintus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus...


  EXT. ARENA - SUNSET

  Spartacus trots out into the arena.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Behold, Spartacus! Thraex!

    A smattering of CHEERS but mostly boos. His humiliating 
  defeat against Crixus has not been forgotten.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS (O.S.)
                        Joined in battle today by the 
                        Undefeated Gaul! The Champion of 
                        Capua! Behold, Crixus! Murmillo!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.
  CONTINUED:

  Crixus trots out to the ROAR of the masses. He raises his 
  arms, shouting his usual call to glory:

                                        CRIXUS
                        Capua! Shall we begin?!

  The mob goes WILD. Crixus takes his place, nods to 
  Spartacus. Spartacus returns it.


  PULIVINUS

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Together they stand against a man 
                        that has never fallen!  A beast 
                        that has never been tamed!  A 
                        legend that has never been 
                        tarnished!  By the grace of Marcus 
                        Decius Solonius!  Behold, 
                        Theokoles!  The Shadow of Death!

  The crowd ROARS... then SILENCES, excited and terrified as 
  another gate GRINDS OPEN.

  THEOKOLES, THE SHADOW OF DEATH,

  enters the arena, the sky darkening with CLOUDS as he steps 
  onto the sand. He stands nearly seven feet tall.

  His exposed flesh crisscrossed with the scars of a thousand 
  battles. He brandishes a THICK SWORD in each hand. No 
  helmet. No shield. His invincible body his only armor.

  SPARTACUS AND CRIXUS

  trade a look.  Ho-ly fuck me.  A long, silent beat, finally 
  broken by Theokoles roaring to the crowd.  The CROWD erupts 
  in thunderous cheers.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS(cont'd)
                        Begin!

  Crixus surges forward, taking the lead. Spartacus fans out 
  to the side, backing him up. Crixus attacks, his sword 
  singing through the air, helmet gleaming in the sun. 
  THEOKOLES COUNTERS,

  but when Crixus moves back Spartacus surges forward to take 
  up the attack. They continue ebbing and flowing, like 
  Doctore instructed. The crowd GASPS as their swords find 
  their mark, opening up fresh wounds across the giant's 
  mangled flesh.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.
  CONTINUED:

  THE PULVINUS

  is electric with excitement and surprise.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        They draw blood!

  Lucretia's eyes fill with sudden hope. As do Naevia's, 
  unnoticed behind her.

  THE ARENA

  Spartacus and Crixus circle Theokoles, moving without 
  hesitation or fear. Blood splatters as they land more blows.

  THE CHUTES

  Doctore stands at the gate, jaw tense, eyes blazing at the 
  display. Varro, Barca, and a handful of other men from the 
  ludus crowd behind him, cheering. All except Ashur, who 
  hangs back, concern creasing his face.

  CRIXUS

  lands a glancing blow, narrowly avoids Theokoles' sword as 
  it whistles past his helmet.

  SPARTACUS

  rushes in, distracting Theokoles as Crixus redoubles his 
  assault. Swords clash. Blood spews in glorious slow motion 
  as they continue to hack away at the giant. Spartacus lands 
    a devastating blow. The crowd GASPS as

  THEOKOLES STUMBLES

  back in pain. Crixus lands a second, equally devastating 
  blow. Theokoles momentarily lowers his guard, stunned. 
  Spartacus and Crixus both surge forward, simultaneously 
  slicing Theokoles across the chest.

  THEOKOLES FALLS BACK,

  crashing to the sand. BLOOD splashes up into the air. The 
  giant doesn't move. A beat of stunned silence -- broken by 
  the deafening ROAR of the crowd.

  THE PULVINUS

  Everyone leaps to their feet. Tears well in Lucretia's eyes. 
  Naevia beams in relief. Batiatus cheers. Solonius looks 
  stricken.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

                                        BATIATUS
                        Yes! YES!

  THE CHUTES

  The men go insane. PUSH IN ON Doctore, his eyes wide in 
  disbelief.

  THE ARENA

  Crixus whips off his helmet. Spartacus follows suit. They 
  share a grin. Crixus throws his arms up in victory. The 
  crowd ROARS. Crixus motions for Spartacus to do the same. He 
  laughs, reluctantly complies. The crowd ROARS -- then 
  suddenly falls silent.

  THEOKOLES STIRS

  behind Spartacus and Crixus. LIGHTNING FLASHES as he rises, 
  bloodied and wounded but far from dead.

  THE PULVINUS

  Batiatus' joy crumbles. Lucretia stiffens in concern, as 
  does Naevia behind her.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                  stunned)(
                      He yet lives!

  Solonius smiles, assured in the outcome as he looks back to 
  --

  THE ARENA

  Theokoles laughs, his voice a deep and terrible thing. He 
  looks out across the arena, ROARS to the crowd.

                                          THEOKOLES
                        Capua! Shall I begin?!

  The crowd goes INSANE.

  THE CHUTES

  Doctore's eyes drain of hope. Dread seizes Varro's heart. 
  Ashur allows himself a grin in the background.

  THE ARENA

  Theokoles grins as he trots towards Spartacus and Crixus. 
  Spartacus shares a concerned look with Crixus. Perhaps the 
  legends are true. The Shadow can truly not be killed.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  THEOKOLES

  slams into them, swords contrailing through the air. 
  Spartacus and Crixus engage the giant, once again working as 
  one, ebbing and flowing in their attack. Theokoles is driven 
  back -- then suddenly counters, driving the two men back, 
  giving them no time to regroup.

  SPARTACUS AND CRIXUS

  struggle under the assault, their carefully orchestrated 
  attacks shattering into chaos.

                                        CRIXUS
                                to Spartacus)(
                        Move out of the way, you fucking --

  WHAM! Theokoles slams Spartacus into Crixus, sending both 
  men crashing to the ground in a tangled heap. Theokoles 
  laughs, grandstanding for the crowd. Crixus hisses at 
  Spartacus.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Give ground, or I'll kill you 
                        myself!

  Crixus rises. Spartacus follows, eyes deepening with worry. 
  Whatever common ground they may have shared is quickly 
  slipping away.

  CRIXUS

  rushes Theokoles. Theokoles whirls to met him. Swords flash, 
  Theokoles' blade finding its mark and SLICING open Crixus' 
  arm. BLOOD flies as he staggers back in shock. The crowd 
  ROARS.

  THE PULVINUS

  Lucretia sucks air. Batiatus sinks into despair, his ruin at 
  hand. Solonius gloats.

  THE ARENA

  Spartacus rushes in to distract Theokoles from the wounded 
  Crixus. They trade thunderous blows. Theokoles whirls, 
  slamming his sword into Spartacus' shield with such force 
  the smaller man is sent flying, landing hard some distance 
  away. He spits blood, dazed and nearly unconscious from the 
  blow.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

  THEOKOLES

  turns his attention back to Crixus as the Gaul rushes him, 
  mad with rage. Lightning fast blows are exchanged. Crixus 
  sees advantage and RAMS HIS SWORD through the side of 
  Theokoles' gut. The crowd gasps. A frozen moment -- broken 
  by Theokoles snarling and HEADBUTTING Crixus.

  CRIXUS STUMBLES BACK,

  blood spurting from his nose as he loses his grip on his 
  sword. Theokoles drops one of his own and with a grunt PULLS 
  THE SWORD FROM HIS SIDE and attacks Crixus with it. Crixus 
  tries to deflect with his shield, but

  THEOKOLES SLICES CRIXUS OPEN

  from stomach to chest, sending blood spraying. Crixus loses 
  his shield as he's spun around from the blow. Theokoles 
  SLICES CRIXUS ACROSS THE BACK, sending more blood spewing. 
  Crixus staggers, falls to his knees. The roar of the crowd 
  fades as he looks up to

  THE PULVINUS

  where Lucretia stands stricken. But it's Naevia's face he 
  seeks. He finds it, slick with tears. The deafening ROAR of 
  the crowd surges back up.

  THE ARENA

  Theokoles moves in behind Crixus. He raises his sword to 
  decapitate him and --

                                          SPARTACUS
                        THEOKOLES!

  Theokoles turns. Spartacus has risen, bloodied but 
  determined. Spartacus snarls and charges. Theokoles grins, 
  kicking Crixus to the ground before whirling to meet 
  Spartacus.

  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES

  as the two warriors trade bone-shattering blows. Theokoles 
  swings his sword. Spartacus bends out of the way, narrowly 
  avoiding decapitation. He counters, slamming his shield into 
  Theokoles' wounded side. The giant howls, SMASHING THE 
  SHIELD from Spartacus' grasp.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.
  CONTINUED:

  SPARTACUS

  crashes across the sand, landing near Theokoles' sword, 
  abandoned when he pulled Crixus' sword from his side. 
  Spartacus snatches it up and reengages the giant with TWO 
  SWORDS as he attacks. Steel flashes.

  CRIXUS

  sputters blood, spots his helmet glinting in the sun close 
  by. He struggles to reach it. Spartacus is smashed back. 
  Just as Theokoles raises his sword for the death blow, 
  Crixus latches onto the gleaming helmet, REFLECTING A RAY OF 
  SUNLIGHT into the giant's eyes.

  THEOKOLES GRUNTS,

  momentarily blinded. Spartacus seizes the distraction and 
  attacks, slicing into Theokoles. BLOOD SPLATTERS. The giant 
  raises his sword to counter but SPARTACUS SWINGS UP, HACKING 
  OFF THE FRONT OF THEOKOLES' FACE.

  THE CROWD GASPS

  as Theokoles staggers. He works the half of his jaw that 
  remains as he collapses to his knees, blood pouring from his 
  ruined face. Spartacus swings again, DECAPITATING THEOKOLES 
  in a GEYSER OF BLOOD.

  THE CHUTES

  A bit of the giant's blood SPLATTERS across Doctore's 
  face...and for the first time, we see the formidable man 
  smile. Varro and the men go INSANE behind him. Ashur glances 
  at the celebrating Barca, realizing he just lost a fortune 
  to him on the wager. He is now beyond fucked.

  THE ARENA

  The giant's body slumps to the sand. LIGHTNING FLASHES. 
  THUNDER BOOMS. The heavens split open as it begins to RAIN. 
  The crowd ROARS.

  THE PULVINUS

  Batiatus throws his arms up in celebration, gloating over 
  Solonius as the Magistrate bolts to his feet. Ilithyia is 
    post-orgasmic, the sight of gore exploding inside her. 
  Lucretia stands numb. Her eyes, as well as Naevia's, fall on





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.
  CONTINUED:

  CRIXUS,

  the rain mixing with the blood caked on his face as he slips 
  into unconsciousness. Spartacus glances at him with concern 
  as the Medicus rushes to aid the fallen Gaul. The crowd 
  ROARS Spartacus' name, drawing his attention to the stands.

                                        THE CROWD
                          Spar-ta-cus!! Spar-ta-cus!!

  Spartacus holds his blood-drenched arms up in victory. The 
  crowd roars. The drought is ended. But the legend of 
  Spartacus has just begun...


  BLACKOUT.
