          RECAP - BRIEF REMINDER OF KATE'S DEATH


  11EXT. FAITH HERITAGE ALLIANCE - DAY

          The Cruiser parks, BRUCE alone inside, and we can hear
          the car radio tuned to a news station before he turns off
          the engine...

                                        NEWSRADIO
                        ...a few clouds... maybe a widely
                          scattered sprinkle or two...
                        nothing to spoil our Fourth of
                        July weekend...

          That's all and he's out, moving toward the administration
          building... a light roll of thunder brings his attention
          to --


22HIS POV - THE SKY (STOCK)

            scattered clouds but not overcast... an interesting sky...
          one cloud though looks kind of ominous... a thunderhead...


  33RESUME BRUCE

          as he grins and shakes his head...

                                        BRUCE
                                (to himself)
                        If you don't like the weather in
                        Maine, just wait a few minutes.


  44INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          SARAH, WALT and DANA are already there chatting with a
            concerned PURDY as Bruce enters...

                                        BRUCE
                        Hi guys...

                                        PURDY
                        Ah, good, that's everyone then.
                                (sighs)
                        I think you all know why we're
                        here...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - TEASER - 6/11/03 - 2nd BLUE     2.

                                        DANA
                                (to Bruce, re: Johnny)
                        Has anyone talked with him lately?

                                        BRUCE
                        He's not into talking.  Or
                        listening.

                                        SARAH
                        If you ask me, he still hasn't
                        gotten over Kate's death.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's Kate... but it's more than
                        Kate.  It's all of it.  It's all
                        the visions.  Every day of his
                        life.  Hundreds of them.

                                        PURDY
                                (sighs)
                        ...God has asked a lot of him... 
                        Under the same conditions, any of
                        us might begin to lose our way.

                                        DANA
                        You mean the way out.  He's barely
                        left his house for the last few
                        months.

                                        WALT
                        And the only people he lets in 
                        are the kids he's tutoring in
                        science this summer.

                                        SARAH
                        He just... doesn't want to touch
                          anyone...
                                (and even worse)
                        ...and doesn't want anyone to
                        touch him.

          More than anyone, Sarah can't bear to think of Johnny in
          this fashion...

                                        PURDY
                        I'd like to propose an
                          intervention.  His best friends
                          confronting him as a group.  I've
                        done several for members of the
                          congregation...

                                        BRUCE
                        We have to get him out of that
                          house...

                                        PURDY
                        Agreed.  I'm happy to offer the
                          Alliance retreat up at Moosehead...

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll get him there.

                                        DANA
                        How do you throw a surprise party
                        for a psychic?

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't let him touch you.

          Rolling thunder.          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - TEASER - 6/11/03 - 2nd BLUE     4.


  55INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY - JOHNNY SMITH

          Wearing a lab apron, protective goggles hanging around
          his neck, looking at us through a small maze of science
          lab equipment, a wry smile on his face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Behold, a tablespoonful of ordinary
                        flour, just like you might bake
                        cookies with.

          Johnny picks up a bunsen burner and torches the spoonful
          of flour.  Reveal we're:


  66INT. JOHNNY'S DINING ROOM - DAY

          Johnny has converted his dining room into a science class
          for a group of high school students he's tutoring - a
          HALF DOZEN KIDS failing chemistry - something he's
          determined not to let happen.  His dining room table is
          covered in lab gear, beakers, glass tubing, a distilling
          rig, a bunsen burner, several 3D models of simple
          molecules.

          Behind Johnny is a rolling white board covered in a diagram
          of flour and oxygen molecules, along with the words;
            PARTICLE, DISPERSION, COMPACTION, FLAMMABLE, INFLAMMABLE,
          each with a dictionary definition written underneath.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Observe what happens when we apply
                        heat -- doesn't burn does it? 
                        Why?

          THE KIDS

          Kind of a rough bunch, not your typical science nerds, in
          fact just the opposite, but they're into it, drawn in by
          Johnny's enthusiasm... and the prospect of blowing up the
          house.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        The tiny flour particles are too
                          compact, there's no room for oxygen
                          molecules to get in there to feed
                        the chemical reaction necessary
                        for a fire.  We have plenty of
                        heat, but no oxygen.  Not much
                        fun huh?

          During the above, the doorbell rings.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                                (yelling)
                        It's open.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - TEASER - 6/11/03 - 2nd BLUE     5.


    6CONTINUED:6

          Bruce pokes his head in, surprised at what he finds.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh good it's just you.  I was
                        worried it might be the Fire
                          Marshall.  Welcome to Mr. Wizard's
                        science lab.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't let me interrupt.

          Johnny continues with his demonstration as Bruce watches;
          he picks up a large glass tube, about a quarter inch in
          diameter and two feet long.  As Bruce and the students
          watch in curiosity, he dips one end of the tube into the
          flour, so that the end of the tube is stuffed full of
          about a half inch of powder.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Same flour as before.

          Next he places the other end of the tube in his mouth.

                                        GOTH GIRL
                        Whasup Mr. Smith, you gonna smoke
                        that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... I'm going to disperse it.  
                          Everybody step back.

          With a bit of a mad professor grin, Johnny aims the glass
          tube at the bunsen burner and BLOWS.  The flour dust hits
          the flame of the burner and EXPLODES in a ball of fire.

          The kids all recoil and duck, eyes wide.

                                        GOTH GIRL
                        Cool!

          Johnny and Bruce exchange a mischievous look.  Bruce almost
          forgets for a moment why he's there.

                                        JOHNNY
                        When I blew the flour out of the
                        tube, the compacted particles
                        became dispersed allowing the

                        Okay, that's it for today.  DON'T
                        TRY THIS AT HOME!  See you all
                        Monday.

          Johnny cleans up... as the kids leave, murmuring to each
          other about the awesome demonstration.  Bruce moves to
            Johnny...

                                        BRUCE
                                (appreciating him)
                        I've never actually seen the old
                        John in action.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (with a trace of loss)
                        I was a pretty good teacher in my
                        day.

                                        BRUCE
                        You still are.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (without conviction)
                        Yeah.

          Johnny moves away from these feelings, physically moving
          away from Bruce who represents responsibility he doesn't
          want to face... Bruce trails him --

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, let's get out of here.  I've
                        planned a day trip for us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Naw, I really think I'll stick
                        close to home this weekend. 
                        Holiday traffic and all that. 
                        And there's a triple header on
                        ESPN I've really been looking
                        forward to...

                                        BRUCE
                        You've been sticking close to
                        home going on months now, John.  
                        Come on, you need a little fresh
                        air.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (casual, on the move)
                        I can't control things outside
                        that door, Bruce.

                        Outside that door are visions and
                          Stillson and Armageddon and world
                        where someone like Kate has to
                        die just so someone else can live. 
                        At least here, I have some
                        control...
                                (picking up the TV

                        The remote control... and an
                        occasional chance to be the old
                        John with a few kids who are trying
                        to pass chemistry...

          Johnny turns to his friend, this is a thanks for your
          concern but it's not going to work moment...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, look, really, I'm glad you're
                        here, it's not that I don't
                          appreciate...

          He tries to put his arm around his friend... but Bruce
          weaves out of his touch...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?
                                (is the problem?)

          Johnny looks at him curiously... realizing Bruce is trying
          to avoid being touched.

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, John... let's go for a
                        ride...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is it with you and this day
                        trip?

          He reaches out to touch Bruce and Bruce avoids him again...

                        You really don't want me to touch

                        What, were we going to pick up
                          everyone else on the way?  No
                        thanks.  I don't need an
                          intervention.

                                        BRUCE
                        Your friends are worried about
                        you and you're gonna hear what
                        they have to say.  And when we
                        get there, you're gonna act
                        surprised.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not going.

                                        BRUCE
                        Look, John... one way or the other,
                        you're going.  I'm fully committed
                        to putting you in that car... and
                        I'll do anything it takes to get

                        I can save you all that pain...

                        Liar.  You didn't see any broken
                        leg.

                        red and itchy under the cast and

  1313INT. CAFE - CONTINUOUS

          A bell over the door tinkles as Johnny enters, moves
          immediately to the counter... where a rural faced MANAGER
          mans the cash register... there are large windows around
          the place so you can see outside... several customers are
            eating...

                        I'm being abducted.  The African-
                          American man outside attacked me
                        and forced me into his car.
                                (the man starts to
                                look out a window)
                        Don't look at him.  Call the
                        police.  Um, State police.  Not
                        the county sheriff.

                        Are you serious?

          The bell over the door tinkles again as Bruce enters...

                        You want to get a couple sodas to

                          Anything you say, mister.

          Bruce doesn't notice the attendant staring at him with
          scared eyes...

                        Think you can ring us up now...

          As the manager looks back to Johnny, reaches for the chips
          to ring them up... on the exchange, RAMP TO JOHNNY FACE...

          as he realizes Bruce and the manager are looking at him

          he's thinking, again?  He sighs, has no choice, glances
          at Bruce... then back to the manager and says quietly...

                        There's going to be a storm.  A

                        tornado...

          The man just stares at him, this has to be some kind of

                                        MANAGER
                          A minute ago, he told me you were
                          abducting him.

                                        BRUCE
                                (does a take, looks
                                at Johnny who shrugs,
                                I had to try)
                        He... told you... that...?

          He laughs embarrassed...

                                        MANAGER
                        Is this a rib?  Did Wally at the
                        car lot send you over here to... 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (deadly serious)
                        I know you don't believe me.  But
                        when the storm comes and it will
                        come... remember what I said...
                        don't wait, don't think... get
                          everyone to safety right away. 
                        Please.  People will die here if
                        you do not take cover.

          Off the manager's confused and concerned face...          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT ONE - 6/11/03 - 2nd BLUE  14A.


  2020EXT. CAFE - DAY

          As they come out... but Johnny is not the usual Johnny -
          he's not into this... he doesn't want to be a hero... he
          feels more like a victim than a hero...

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, this better be on the level
                        because if you're just trying
                        to...
                                (get out of the
                                  intervention)








































                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT ONE - 5/01/03 - GREEN      15.


    20CONTINUED:20

          But he can see that Johnny is in a dark place... genuinely
            concerned... the internal pain that Johnny has been
          containing for months is moving to the surface...

                                        JOHNNY
                        How many times do I have to see
                          something like this?  How many
                        people have to die in my mind
                        before I go crazy? 

          Bruce looks at him... and now Johnny makes eye contact
          with him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why do I have to live with these
                        things?  I'm a human being.

          It's all said quietly, painfully, lost... seeking answers
          where there are none.  Bruce sees the pain his friend is
          in... tries to reassure him -- compassionate --

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, you may have just saved lives
                        back there...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quiet, to himself)
                        Too many lives to save.  Too many
                        lives I can't save.  

                                        BRUCE
                        Look, John... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't... do this anymore.  I
                        can't have these visions in my
                        head any more.

          He moves to the car.  Bruce isn't sure what to do next...
          quietly --

                                        BRUCE
                        So what do you want to do, John? 
                        I mean, about the storm.  

          A long beat as Johnny struggles with the weight of the
            responsibility... Bruce understands he needs to lead him
          here...

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        Look, there's an airfield a few
                        miles west of here... it's just a
                        little out of our way... we need
                        to find someone tied into the
                        weather service... warn them,
                        don't you think?

                                (he waits for a
                                  response, doesn't
                                get one, grabs his
                                cell)
                        Come on, get in.  We'll backtrack
                        this way later.  I'll call the
                        others to let them know we'll be
                        late.

          Johnny opens the car door to get in... a chip planted
          firmly on his shoulder... a chip against the fates, even
          against God...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (whatever)
                        You're driving. 


  2121EXT. A RURAL AIRFIELD - DAY - ESTABLISHING (STOCK)


  2222INT. A SMALL WEATHER STATION - DAY

          In an office by the tower... it's full of high tech weather
          systems, Doppler radar, a computer monitor displaying
          weather maps and such... the meteorologist is an attractive
          woman dressed casually in jeans and a T-shirt... we'll
          call her TONI for old times sake... they've just told her
          about Johnny's vision and she's incredulous but trying to
          be polite.  Johnny lets Bruce carry the ball, observes
          from his dark emotional place...

                                        TONI
                        I don't know what to tell you,
                        but there's nothing on the weather
                        map that even begins to suggest...

                                        BRUCE
                                  (impatient)
                        Miss Donahue, if Johnny saw it,
                        it will happen...  

          She looks at Johnny, tries not to show her skepticism...

                                        TONI
                        I... I'm sorry but I can't put
                        out an emergency advisory based
                        on... a psychic vision... here,
                        look at the radar yourself...
                        these are WSR-88D images from the
                        Doppler radar at Gray, Maine...
                        the dark green is precipitation... 
                        you've got a little up by the
                          border...

                        light shower over in Aroostook...

          Johnny's been through this too many times... he looks at
          Bruce... 

                                        BRUCE
                          Couldn't one of the little green
                        things turn into a big green
                          thing...?

                                        TONI
                        We use a very sophisticated system
                        called the Mesocyclone Detection
                          Algorithm to identify potential
                        supercells and there isn't one in
                          sight...

                                        BRUCE
                        And you're never wrong.

                                        TONI
                        Of course, we're wrong sometimes... 
                        We're The Weatherman.  But we've
                        only had one M-D-A detection
                        failure in this region I know of
                        and that was eight years ago...
                        June 6, 1995 near Lake
                          Cobbosseecontee...

          Johnny, who has been tuning out, now reacts...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reacts)
                        What... what did you say?  June
                        6th?

                                        TONI
                        1995.

                                (beat)
                        I remember that storm.  June 6th. 
                        That was the day of my accident.

          He glances at Bruce who reacts... a curious coincidence
          to be sure.


  2323INT. MOOSEHEAD LAKE - FAITH HERITAGE RETREAT - DAY

          We can see the lake and clear blue sky through the windows

                        Well, if they're going to be
                        awhile, I invite you to take
                          advantage of the setting...

                        Swim?  Now?

                        It's a lake, Walt.

                        You brought a bathing suit to an

                        Who said anything about a suit?

                        Maybe we should do an intervention
                        for you while we're waiting for
                        Johnny to get here.

                        I'm sure Dana recalls... from
                        earlier visits... that we keep a
                        variety of swimwear for guests...
                        if you're interested, I'm sure
                        you'll find something that fits...

          Dana grins evenly at Sarah and clearly her line about not
          wearing suits was just to provoke a response from Sarah...

                        If you're hungry, the chef sent
                        up some lovely salmon for lunch...
                        please make yourself at home...

          The people move inside... Purdy walks over to the
          lakeside... takes in some fresh air... takes in the majesty
          of the lake...

          After a beat, something falls out of the sky next to him...
          and splats by his feet... he reacts with a start, looks
          down to see --

                        To know.  And never be wrong. 
                        There is no hope left.  I mean
                        how many times have we've been
                        through this, Bruce?  We tell
                        them what's gonna happen... they
                        say it's impossible... they show
                        you why it's impossible... and
                        then it happens...

                                        BRUCE
                        It doesn't always happen...
                          sometimes you can change it...

                                (re: raindrops)
                        Like a storm.  
                                  (concerned)
                        How far are we from the cafe?

                                        BRUCE
                        Five, six miles...

                                        JOHNNY
                        We need to get there... make sure
                        that guy believed me...

                                        BRUCE
                        He's probably got the cops after
                        my ass by now for kidnapping...

            Suddenly, the drops begin to click-click-click... they
          react... it's starting...

                                        BRUCE
                        Hail.

          Now... it really starts to come down... the ice banging
          on the roof... the windshield blinded...

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn... Gotta pull over.

          He pulls off the road (they're near a culvert) but for
          the moment we stay in the car and their pov, Hitchcock
          style.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, it's really coming down.

          But it gets worse.  The ice is the size of golf balls
          now... and it's really coming down... the windshield cracks
          with the impact of a baseball sized ice block... BANG!...
          they recoil... another BANG and a crack... another...
          BANG!... and there are holes where the ice struck... and
          it's scary as hell... BANG, BANG, BANG...

          And the wind is howling outside...

          and the car is rocking back and forth... hard... Johnny's
          hand reaches up and touches the roof for stability... a
          DZ sound fx... push to Johnny as he gets a vision we can't
          see...

                                        JOHNNY
                        We have to get out of the car...

                        What... are you crazy...?  We
                        can't go out in this...

          But Johnny's pushing open the door... trying to get out...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm a psychic, Bruce and I'm
                        telling you we have to get out of
                        the car.

                        I'm right behind you...

          Bruce crawls over the front seat, follows him out the
          same door...

          staying tight on them as they exit the car... Bruce and
          Johnny fight the wind and hail (and don't get seriously
          wet)... and duck inside the culvert, grabbing on to
          whatever they can...


  2626ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE CULVERT

          Suddenly from straight overhead... the cruiser comes
          crashing down from the sky right on the front bumper...
          smashing and crunching up like an accordion just yards
          away...

          On their reactions...

  2727EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce walking along the rural highway... the
          sound of a car... it's approaching... they wave their
          arms...

                                        JOHNNY & BRUCE
                        Hey... wait... slow down...

          The car passes without slowing down...

                                (to the unseen driver)

                                (beat)
                        That's five, five 'good' people
                        who looked right at us and made a
                          conscious decision to ignore us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, well we're officially
                          hitchhikers now.  A lot people
                        won't pick up hitchhikers.

                                        BRUCE
                                (not really serious,
                                using it to make his
                                  point)
                        No this is your fault.  You've
                        lost the karma, man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh sure, blame my karma. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You have turned your back on the
                        world and the world is turning
                        its back on us.

          Another car approaches... not a car... a Winnebago...
          they signal it to stop... it passes, then hits the
            brakes... so hard they squeal... Johnny and Bruce run to
          the car...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't hear you giving my karma
                        credit, man.

          As they reach the Winnebago, the window rolls down to
          reveal a housewife in her forties, we'll call her FLO...
          driving is her husband, MITCH, and there are two kids,
          eight and ten, MITCH JUNIOR and FIONA.

  2828INT. WINNEBAGO - CONTINUOUS

          This is a family that has taken great pains to make this
          space their own... nice family touches adorn the
          interior... post cards from several places they've been
          all over the country are stuck to the walls... one of the
          cards has the Indian Johnny logo...

          Fiona never takes off her earphones plugged into an MP3
            player... her head bobs to some barely heard hip-hop
          beat... Mitch Jr. is into his Gameboy with both hands...
          he couldn't care less about Johnny Smith... neither pay
          him attention...

                        touch the kids and tell me if
                        they'll go to ivy league schools...

          For a beat, Johnny isn't sure if Mitch is serious...

                                        MITCH
                        I'm just pulling your leg...

          He laughs, pulls the big wagon back on the road...

                                        MITCH
                        But you can touch them if you
                        want.  I don't mind.

                        bathtub with my eyes closed...
                        and it was almost like I could
                        hear him crying in my mind... I
                        just knew he'd been bit...  And I
                        jumped up and ran across the street
                        half dressed...  Oh my, what a
                        day, that was...

                        They said in the emergency room a
                        few minutes later would have been
                        too late...

                                        FLO
                        I mean, that's the only time I've
                        ever felt anything like that...
                        call it a mother's intuition, I
                        don't know...
                              (a tear rolls down
                                her cheek)
                        But it sure makes you wonder...
                        where it comes from... how is it
                          possible...

          Her story has touched Johnny and he smiles genuinely for
          the first time in this episode...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (genuine)
                        If you ever find out, let me know.

          They share a smile.

                                        FLO
                        For me... on that day... no doubt
                        in my mind...
                                (beat)
                        It was a gift from God.  A gift
                        from God.

          As Johnny reacts...


  2929EXT. MOOSEHEAD LAKE - DAY

          Purdy has called others out to see the fish... Walt and
          Sarah are collecting them in plastic bags...

                        They're ice cold... some of them
                        are frozen...

                        It was absolutely the most
                          startling thing I've ever seen...

                                        WALT
                        No miracle here, Reverend.  I've
                        read about raining fish in National
                          Geographic... A small waterspout
                        in a thunderstorm is all you need -
                        sucks them up into the clouds
                        then dumps them miles away...

                        But from a clear blue sky...?

                        It's been known to happen... and
                        not just with fish, birds get
                        caught up too, and there were
                        some toads that fell in Mexico a
                        few years back... and blood...

                                        SARAH
                        Blood?

                        The article said "rains of blood"
                        have been reported all over the
                        world since ancient history. 

          Dana comes out of the cabin, carrying a folding chair...
          she's wearing a conservative and yet snug and sexy two
          piece bathing suit and sunglasses... Walt, being a red-
          blooded American man, can't help but glance her way as he
          says...

                          Probably just red dust mixed with
                        water.

          He sees Sarah watching him watching Dana... he reacts,
            caught...

                        I see you found something that
                        almost fits.

                                        DANA
                        You could use a little color in

                        the retreat -- there's no reception
                        up here.

          As Dana opens the chair and lays down, staring at the
          dead fish...

  3030EXT. RURAL MAINE ROAD - DAY

          As the Winnebago moves toward the gas station/cafe... 
          half the cafe has been flattened, the other half is barely
          hanging together... there is debris everywhere... it looks
          like... well, it looks like a tornado has been there...


  3131ANGLE ON THE WINNEBAGO

          as it pulls to a stop... and Johnny and Bruce get out,
          followed by the McMurtrys...  there are downed power lines
          fritzing... smoke...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call 9-1-1.  Better keep the kids
                        inside the van... 

          The parents acknowledge... John moves with a purpose toward
          the wreckage...

                                        BRUCE
                        John, be careful... you've got
                        live power lines...

          Bruce trails as Johnny moves carefully to the creaky
            structure... Johnny moves closer and touches the debris...

          A DZ SOUND EFFECT... Push to Johnny as he realizes --

                                        JOHNNY
                        There are people in there... and
                        they're alive...  

          Johnny moves around the precarious structure...  Bruce
          follows him, almost loses his footing on debris... the
          McMurtys react...

                                        MITCH
                        Stay here.

                                  happens)
                        I love you, mother.

          Kisses her on the cheek and rushes to help Johnny and
          Bruce... Johnny starts to duck down into an open space
          and pulls debris out of the way... the others move in to
            assist...


          ANGLE

          as they quickly clear their way to a basement door... and
          find five people huddled there... safe... but scared and
          hearts beating...

                        No... as soon as I heard the
                        freight train coming... I started
                          thinking about what you said and
                        moved everyone to the basement...

                                (out of breath)
                        That's what it sounded like...
                        only we don't have no tracks out
                        here...  

          As they move out of the dangerous structure... it collapses
          behind them...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT TWO - 5/01/03 - GREEN      30.


  31A31ASOME TIME LATER

            Emergency vehicles are now on the scene... fire trucks,
          an ambulance...  Medics are attending to the Manager and
          his people... finding Mitch Jr. and Fiona by the Winnebago,
          both paying no attention, he's still Gameboying it, she's
          still bobbing her head to the MP3... and now, moving to
          Mitch and Flo.

                                        MITCH
                        Johnny, we'd love to stay but
                        this is just a little too exciting
                        for the missus and me... we're
                        heading down south to Graceland
                        next...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks for your help, Mitch.

          Johnny feels a hand touch his arm... he looks at Flo who
          smiles bashfully... pulls it back...

                                        FLO
                        Sorry, I had to do it... everyone
                        at home will ask if I touched  
                        Johnny Smith...  

                                        MITCH
                        So?  What'dju see...?

                                        FLO
                        Mitch, stop.

                                        MITCH
                        No.  What'dju see...

                                        FLO
                        I don't want to know.  Unless
                        it's really bad of course.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw a safe trip.

          The McMurtrys climb back into the Winnebago... wave good-
          bye... as they pull away, Johnny and Bruce look over and
          see --


          NEW ANGLE - TONI GETTING OUT OF A SMALL TRUCK

          She's just arrived... looking at the damage, stunned... 
          she moves to the back of the truck where some weather
            equipment is set up, including a laptop computer with

                          Embarrassed.  I don't understand
                        it... it never showed up on the
                          radar... nothing on satellite
                          coverage...

                        Every fifteen minutes.  Radar
                        every six minutes.  I guess it
                        could have happened between
                          intervals... although this kind
                        of damage... it's hard to believe. 
                        Based on the visual evidence, I'd
                        almost want to guess an F-3
                          event... except... well I hate to
                        use the word 'impossible' twice
                        in one day...

                                        TONI
                        In its entire recorded history,
                        Maine's never had an F-3.

          Johnny and Bruce react... thunder rumbles... they look

                        It means there's a sixty-two
                        percent chance this storm will
                        result in additional tornado
                          activity.

          But a few heavy drops of rain have started falling again...
          we can see splats on the truck, the roadside... Johnny
          looks up and opens his palm to feel the rain and as...

          FILLED WITH THUNDER AND LIGHTNING... AND WE'RE THROWN

                        system, isn't he...?

                        They're in danger.  We have to
                        warn them.  There's still time.

  3535EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - TONI'S TRUCK - ROLLING ALONG, SET
          AGAINST A STORMY SKY - DAY

          And I'm feeling we should keep the weather threatening
          for most of Johnny's journey now... not rain but a
            dangerous looking sky... full of electricity...


  3636INT. TRUCK - DAY

          As they drive... and Toni's eyes are on the road ahead
          but she's seeing the most frightening day of her life as
          she talks, a day that changed her, shaped her, haunts
          her... the speech needs to be spoken with great pace,
          evenly, not to be milked for emotion - just put out there
          with an intensity...

                                        TONI
                        I was fourteen when I saw my first
                        one.  I was coming out of a movie
                        theater outside Nashville.  Rambo,
                        Part Two.  The boy I was with was
                        a big Sly fan. 
                                (smiles at the memory)
                          ...Bobby Tucci...  He was older
                        and I wasn't supposed to be out
                        with him, my parents didn't like
                        him and I'd lied to them about
                        where I was going... anyway, we're
                        coming out... and the sky is a
                        dark mustard green... and
                        everything is still... you could
                        just feel something was wrong. 
                        And then we saw it... like a shoe-
                        string in the sky... and Bobby,
                        jerk, he takes off... just takes
                        off and leaves me standing there...

                                        BRUCE
                        See, your parents were right about
                        him...

                                        TONI
                        That's exactly what I was thinking.
                        And I start to run across the
                          street... and I hear myself saying
                        'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'... as though
                        this storm was coming for me...
                        you know, because I'd been out
                        with Bobby Tucci...!

                        I duck into a Shakey's Pizza with
                        a birthday party for some kids...
                        all with silver party hats on...
                        and we crawl under tables...  One
                        kid is eating pepperoni pizza
                        under the table like nothing is
                          happening... and I'm closing my
                        eyes swearing out loud that I'll
                        never go out with Bobby again...

                        Hell, no,  I know better than to

                        When it was over, we came out --
                        the other side of the street was
                        gone... it was gone... the movie
                        theater I just came out of was
                        gone... and our side was
                          untouched...  
                                (beat)
                        It's hard to accept the idea of
                          random... we all like
                          explanations... a way to make
                        sense of things that don't make
                          sense... and I guess I've spent
                        my life trying to make sense of
                        that day...
                                (glances at Johnny)
                        And you haven't made my job any
                        easier today.

          not at all sure about the drift of the conversation they
          just had.  As they walk into the cabin... as in Johnny's
          vision --


          WIND CHIMES

          hanging from the cabin... beginning to tinkle in the
            breeze... then we hear a squeak...


            A KINETIC SCULPTURE

            beginning to turn in the breeze... and a banging...


          A WOOD GATE

          banging back and forth in the breeze... lightning crackles
          in the sky and distant thunder rumbles...

          But dark in this forest of mammoth trees.  Finding tall
          timber, struck by lightening, has fallen and blocked the
          way of a small traveling carnival... a rig has jack-knifed
          trying to avoid the fallen tree - it's a mess - a variety
          of games and rides and trailers are all backed up... Toni's
          truck pulls up behind them... but has no way around...
          she has to park...

          weird sight indeed --


  4444THEIR POV - SLOWLY MOVING FORWARD - MAYBE EVEN SLOW MO

          among the carnies trying to clear the road... illuminated
          by the truck headlights and sporadic lightning... are a
          tattooed man... CARNIVAL MOM... LITTLE PERSON... STRONG
          MAN... pin-cushion man... and other assorted weird looking
          people from the carny "freak" show... there are a couple

                        I'm gonna check the readings on
                        my equipment...

          As Toni goes to the back of the truck... Bruce and Johnny
          move forward to see if they can help...

          And a CARNY turns to Bruce... and it's the same carny
          that appeared in our pilot... from the wheel of fortune...
          the night Johnny had his accident... thunder and lightning
          in the background punctuate the sequence...

                        this tree... can you give us a
                        hand over here...

          Thunder growls as the carny, Bruce and Johnny move over...


          ANGLE

          The crew has set up an ad hoc pulley device to try and
          facilitate the removal of the tree from the narrow road...

          the strong man, standing among the other 'freaks' about
          to pitch in, glances over to Johnny, smiles casually with

          Johnny acknowledges... as they all grab onto the device
          and begin to struggle with the weight... RAMP TO JOHNNY...

                        We're five minutes from the
                          retreat.

          He drives... Johnny looks straight ahead... internal
            confusion in his eyes...


  5555INT. CABIN - DAY

          Thunder rumbling in the distance... Walt tries the phone,
          it's still out... Purdy is lighting candles...


  55A55AINT. KITCHEN

            Candlelight.  Finding Sarah with Dana who is shuddering
          with each storm sound... Sarah is pouring a bottle of
          sherry into a glass for her...

                                        SARAH
                        This'll calm you down...

                                        DANA
                        Cooking sherry?

                                        SARAH
                                (recalling Dana's
                                  earlier line)
                        You'd be surprised what you can
                        find in 'the kitchen'.

                        Touch .

          She drinks a shot.

                                        DANA
                                (re: the sherry)
                        Oh that's bad.  I'll have another.

          Sarah pours...

                                        DANA
                        I hope you don't do a lot of this
                        during the day.

          A crash of thunder.

                                        SARAH
                        I think I'll join you for one. 

          Pours for herself.

                        Don't tell anyone but Purdy keeps
                          a secret case of '89 Montrachet

                        hundred bucks a bottle...

                        Then why the hell are we drinking
                        five dollar sherry?

                                        DANA
                        T'aint chilled -- it would kill
                        him to serve a dry white at room
                          temperature.  Besides, it's a
                        secret because if his flock knew
                        he had alcoholic beverages at his
                          Christian retreat...

                        Ah.

                        Don't worry.  I can give as good
                        as I get.

                                        SARAH
                        I don't think so.

                                        DANA
                        Good.  That would be hard.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.

                                        DANA
                          Considering how we both feel about
                        Johnny.

          Dana makes eye contact with Sarah...

                                        SARAH
                        I don't know what you think is
                        going on... but Johnny is my best
                          friend... He'll always be my...

                                        DANA
                                  (interrupting)
                        When are you going to face it,
                        Sarah?     

          Sarah studies her... as a quiet roll of thunder fills the
          silence... and this speech is said with compassion, not
          anger.

                                        DANA
                        I can be his best friend.  You
                        can't.  He's too deep inside you. 
                        You're too deep inside him.

                        You want to know what I think is
                        going on?  I think there isn't a
                        day in your life that you don't
                        wonder how it might be with Johnny,
                        how you might break it gently to
                        Walt, but you keep seeing that
                        Gentle Ben face of his when you
                        tell the poor bastard.  Walt's a
                        good man.  He deserves someone
                        who can really love him and only
                        him and you hate yourself for not
                        being able to give him that.

                                        SARAH
                        You're wrong.  In fact, Walt and
                        I are talking about having a baby.

          Dana's eyes narrow.  And in a way Sarah is putting it out
          there not just to convince Dana but to convince herself.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT FOUR - 5/01/03 - GREEN     50.


    55ACONTINUED: (3)55A

          But Sarah has not made up her mind about this baby - in
          part because she knows it draws the final line between
          her and Johnny and she just doesn't know if she can do
          that yet.  And there's the old nagging wonder if having a
          baby is a way to "save" this marriage - would she be doing
          it for the right reasons?  All these considerations cannot
          be voiced here but they linger in the silence that follows
          the announcement.  Finally to fill the void --

                                        SARAH
                                  (uncomfortable, not
                                at all harsh)
                        Not that it's any business of
                        yours. I don't even know why I
                        told you.

                                        DANA
                        Don't you?

          Sarah gives her a look that says she's had enough of this,
          puts down her drink and exits...

                                        DANA
                        Damn mouth.

          She pours another drink for herself...

                        Johnny.  Well, I know this looks
                          a little strange... it isn't

                          kitchen.

          The sound of wind building outside... the door that Walt
          was going to look out blows open... some candles blow
          out... Purdy moves instinctively to help close the door...

          It sounds like a freight train approaching outside... a

          They look up... to see --

          They are deeper into the kitchen now... Purdy leads the

          that order).  Johnny brings up the rear.


          GLASSES AND PLATES CRASH AROUND OUR PEOPLE

          Suddenly an entire tree comes crashing through the ceiling
          landing between Sarah and Walt, barely missing them, but
          separating them.  The storm rages outside, the wind
            intensifies.

          make it into the stone hallway.  Purdy directs the women
          toward the storage cellar door.

          Walt and Bruce crawl under the fallen tree and make to
          the stone hallway... Purdy goes to the storage room...  
            lighting, thunder outside... the wind intensifies more... 
          rain and hail falling on them... they're wet and it's
          slippery...


          DRAWERS RATTLE AND SHAKE AND FINALLY OPEN AND KNIVES AND
          FORKS AND SPOONS FLY OUT...


          JOHNNY AND DANA

          crawl under the tree heading toward the hallway... but
          suddenly Dana is sucked toward the open windows... she
          grabs onto the refrigerator handle... but it's a fearsome
          pull... she's blown vertical, feet first toward the
          windows... Johnny reaches out for Walt's hand across the
          river of wind... Walt links arms with Bruce and they brace
          themselves against the stone wall to hold onto Johnny...
          Johnny grabs Dana's hand just as --


          THE ENTIRE WALL BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR IS SUCKED AWAY

            revealing the black storm raging outside...


          THE REFRIGERATOR SUDDENLY RISES OUT OF SIGHT

          And Dana goes with it... and would be gone now... if it
          weren't for Bruce and Walt holding Johnny holding onto
          her...


          HER FACE - FEARFUL


          JOHNNY'S FACE - STRAINING


          WALT AND BRUCE'S FACES - STRAINING

          finally the storm breaks its grip and Johnny pulls her
          back... and they crawl under the tree...          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT FOUR - 6/11/03 - 2nd BLUE  53A.


  5959INT. ENTRANCE TO STORAGE CELLAR

          A small storage room with a few down stairs as they crowd
          in... Johnny is the last one...  but he doesn't go in...
          he starts to close the door behind Bruce...

                                        BRUCE
                        What... what are you...

          But before he can react... Johnny shuts the door and
          latches it so Bruce can't stop him... he turns toward the
          sound of the roaring freight train...


  6060EXT. MOOSEHEAD LAKE - DAY

          As Johnny comes outside, in this incredible storm and
          stares at --          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT FOUR - 5/12/03 - 2nd WHITE  54.


  6161THE MONEY SHOT... THE FULL FUNNEL OF AN F-3 TORNADO IN
          ALL IT'S GLORY... HOVERING IN FRONT OF HIM OVER THE
          LAKE...


  6262JOHNNY

          studies it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want of me? 


  6363THE TORNADO

          moves closer...


  6464JOHNNY - CLOSE - THE WIND AND RAIN WHIPPING HIS FACE

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm a science teacher... and I'm
                        the first to admit... that the
                          universe is full of things that
                        I'll never understand... of...
                        chaos that can't be explained...
                        by me anyway...
                                (beat)
                        Okay... listen to yourself, you're
                        talking to a tornado...


  64A64AANGLE - A TREE IS UPROOTED AND FLIES AWAY


    64B64BRESUME JOHNNY - EVEN CLOSER

          He presses on...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Is that to scare me?  Or is it
                        just a... a... random wind shear? 
                        Because... honestly?    I can't
                        even begin to accept the notion
                        that you've been sent here like...
                        like... the whale was sent to
                        swallow Jonah... to teach me some
                        kind of lesson... I'm sorry, I
                        just... can't... I can't conceive
                        of a God...
                                (beat)
                        ...who would take a young woman's
                        life... who would show me the
                        future and not let me change it...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                                (beat)
                        So now I'm helpless again... what
                        power do I have over a storm,
                        over fate, over destiny?  None.

          He takes a deep breath, tells himself to get on with it...
          and gets to the bargain...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        But if it will help... and believe
                        me I can't believe I'm saying
                        this... if it will save my
                        friends... and anyone else on
                        this lake today... I can tell you
                        one thing about the universe that
                        I do understand now... and that's
                        my place in it... and I will accept
                        that.  If you will spare them... 

          The tornado seems to be inches from Johnny as we intercut
          between him and it... and without resolving anything...

                                                                      FADE TO BLACK.

  6767EXT. MOOSEHEAD LAKE - DAY - ESTABLISHING - THE SUN

          is out.  It looks like a perfect day.  We don't see the
          house.


  6868CLOSE ON THE LATCH TO THE STORAGE CELLAR

          Sun shining on it... someone inside is trying to break
          out... and after a couple of hard rams from inside... the
          screws of the latch give way and the door opens...

          Walt leads the way out with Bruce... Sarah, Dana, Toni
          and Purdy follow... and react as we widen to see...

          The cabin is nothing but rubble... surrounded by a wide
          path of destruction... trees down everywhere... amazingly
          the cars that brought them - if we can see them from here -
          have been spared.

          It is a stunning revelation and these people are
          emotionally shaken... not only by the house... but the
          thought that Johnny has been torn limb from limb...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE STORM - ACT FOUR - 5/12/03 - 2nd WHITE  56.

          CLOSE ON SARAH

          as her eyes see him first... we don't...

                                        SARAH
                                (to herself)
                        Johnny?

          She starts to run... now yelling --

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny...?


          WALT

          reacts, turns to see his wife sprinting... he follows
          her... as do the others...


  6969NEW ANGLE - JOHNNY

          is lying face down, arms splayed, unconscious or asleep
          or dead... as Sarah reaches him first...

                                        SARAH
                          Johnny...

            ...kneels beside him... but as she touches his face
            gently...


          HIS EYES SNAP OPEN

          and he takes a sharp breath as though waking from a
            nightmare... sits upright... heart pounding... he's dirty,
          has scratches on his face... shirt torn... he looks at
          his hands and touches himself... as though to reassure
          himself that he's whole...

                                        SARAH
                        Thank God.

          A tear rolls down her cheek.  Johnny looks at her a
          confused beat...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (casual like any other
                                day)
                        Hey, Sarah.

                                        SARAH
                                (with love and relief)
                        Hey yourself.

    69CONTINUED:69

          And her impulse is to take him in her arms and hold him
          but she fights it back... Walt and the others arrive...

                                        BRUCE
                          Don't... don't move too quickly...
                        take your time..

                                        PURDY
                        What on God's earth you were  
                          thinking?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  Just a crazy notion.

                                        WALT
                        Not a smart move, John.  You're
                        lucky to be alive.

                                        TONI
                        We all are.

          Johnny is on his feet now, a little shaky...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Everybody's okay?

                                        DANA
                        Yes.  We've been drinking a lovely 
                        Montrachet while we waited.

                                        PURDY
                                (not me)
                        Some of us.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Toni)
                        It's over.  The storm.  Check
                        your readings - it's gonna be
                        okay now...

          We can hear sirens in the distance... the group moves
          apart to check out the awesome damage, leaving Johnny and
          Bruce more or less by themselves for a moment...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think we can skip the
                          intervention... spring break's
                        over...

          Bruce studies him a long beat... and suddenly it comes to
          him... laughs...

                                        BRUCE
                        Tell me you did it.

                        Made a deal with the storm.

                        We could use you in the national
