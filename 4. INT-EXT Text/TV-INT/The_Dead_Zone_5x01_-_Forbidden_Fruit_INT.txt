          Johnny's eating breakfast, glancing through the morning
          paper, the TV on in the background.

                                        STERN NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        Local law enforcement remains on
                        high alert after an article in
                        today's Boston Telegraph published
                        an internal White House list of
                        the U.S. locations most vulnerable
                        to a terrorist attack.  Maine's
                        Durgham Point oil refinery is
                        among the sites listed --

          Sick of bad news, he punches the remote.

                        Not for breakfast.

          A few WEATHER STATIONS, an INFO-MERCIAL and then GREG
          STILLSON being interviewed leaving a meeting somewhere...

                                        REPORTER (ON TV)
                          Congressman, what do you think of
                        the article in today's paper
                        concerning Homeland Security?

                                        STILLSON (ON TV)
                        It's obvious that this country
                        needs to refocus its attention
                        and resources inward in respect
                        to Global terrorism, but this
                        isn't the way to do it.  Whoever
                        leaked this report should be
                        brought to face federal charges.

                                        REPORTER (ON TV)
                        What kind of charges?

                        Treason would be a good place to
                        start.

                          Switching gears just a bit, how
                        are your wedding plans coming?

                                        STILLSON (ON TV)
                        Well, I'm a politician, so I know
                        how to delegate authority.  I've
                        left the important decisions to
                        my better half.  It's safe to
                        say, it's going to be the happiest
                        day of my life.

          Stillson smiles into the camera and moves on, as the
          television is shut off.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        This is really going to happen.

          He tosses the cereal bowl into the sink and hurries out...



          Parked across the street.  An UNIDENTIFIED MAN watches
          Miranda from a distance, as he clicks SURVEILLANCE

          Of Miranda as she exits the car, looks around and then
          enters the dress shop.



          Janus' SECURITY MAN (established in "SAVED") sets the
          camera down on the seat beside him as we see he's also
          carrying a gun. 



          In the PRIVATE DRESSING AREA in back of the store.  A
          SALESWOMAN hovers nearby as the shop PHONE RINGS.  The
          saleswoman disappears into the shop as Miranda steps out. 
          She looks stunning in the traditional white dress as she
          looks at herself in a large 3-way mirror.

                        Francesca, I think we need to
                        take it in another inch, don't
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY (O.C.)
                        I think it looks perfect.

          Three reflections of Johnny Smith appear in the mirror as
          he steps up behind her.  She's both surprised and concerned
          to see him. 

                                        MIRANDA
                        Johnny?  What are you doing here?

          Johnny closes the dressing room door and locks it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I came to see you.

          She seems torn, happy to see him, but frightened.

                                        MIRANDA
                        You shouldn't have come here. 
                        I'm getting married in less than
                        36 hours.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I saw your future husband
                        on television.  He's almost as
                        good an actor as you are.

                                        SALESWOMAN (O.C. THROUGH DOOR)
                        Miss Ellis?  Is everything alright?

                        Just a minute! 
                                (to Johnny)
                        You have to go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Say it.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell me that you love Greg
                          Stillson.  Say the words and I'll
                        walk away.

                        What are afraid of?  It's just
                        the two us.  You can be honest.

          Her eyes fill with tears, then...

                                        MIRANDA
                        I love Greg Stillson.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        I was wrong.  You're a much better
                        actor.

                                        MIRANDA
                        You don't understand...

                        I saw you make the deal to protect
                        me.

          She seems surprised to hear it.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Then you know why I have to do
                        this.  It's not just for you. 
                        It's for me, for my father.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        So, you go along with the charade,
                        pretending that you're happy about
                          marrying a man you don't love?

          Johnny can see from her look that she's determined to
          keep him safe, no matter what.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you think Stillson knows about
                        the deal?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I don't know.  He's never mentioned
                        it.  But I know one thing, these
                        people aren't playing games. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What if I could figure a way out
                        of this.

                                        MIRANDA

                        do you know who he is?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I never saw his face.  Why?

                        He broke into my house the same
                        day you came back.  He left me a
                          message.

                                        MIRANDA

                          I haven't figured that out yet. 
                        But I'm pretty sure he's Stillson's
                        new top advisor.  I also think
                        he's connected to Reverend Purdy
                        in some way.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I don't see how this changes
                          anything.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whoever this guy is, he operates
                        in the shadows.  In the dark.  If
                        I can find out who he is, maybe I
                        can I draw him into the light. 
                        Then, maybe, we make a deal of
                        our own.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I don't know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can't give up without a fight.

          As he touches her arm, WHOOSH!



          SENATOR HARLAN ELLIS sits down on the edge of the bed,
          where we see Miranda's wedding dress laid out across the
            mattress.  He picks it up in his hands and begins to weep,
          WHOOSH!  



          Johnny flashes out of the vision.  The KNOCKING on the
          door becomes more desperate.

          FADE IN:



          Johnny is on the computer, as Bruce thumbs through a Bible.

                                        BRUCE
                        He was just holding her wedding
                        dress and crying?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's what I saw.

                                        BRUCE
                        That could mean anything.  Maybe
                        she called it off and the old man
                        lost his ticket to the White House.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe.  I don't intend to leave
                        it to chance.  I'm telling you,
                        it's all connected to this mystery
                        man.  I can feel it in my bones.

          Johnny waits as some pages are being printed.

                                        BRUCE
                        I've been going over the Bible
                        passage he left for you.  It's
                        from the book of Daniel.  "The
                        third ruler of the kingdom."  It
                        sounds to me like he considers
                        you an equal.  Like he's reaching
                        out, trying to make a deal. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        A deal?  He has to know that I'd
                        never do anything to help him or
                          Stillson.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe he's trying to scare you.

          Johnny retrieves the printed pages, then slips on his
          jacket.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen, Sarah's out of town and
                        I'm supposed to pick up J.J. from
                        school and drive him home.  Would
                        you mind?

          Johnny exits, as Bruce continues to look at the Bible.



          Miranda studies the seating chart with the WEDDING PLANNER,
          an officious, woman in a headset.  A cute young female
          FLORIST arranges blooms, including lilies, in a sample
            centerpiece.

                                        WEDDING PLANNER
                        This is a sample table setting,
                        this china is nearly a hundred
                        years old.

                                        MIRANDA
                                (scans list)
                        Is this the official guest list?

                                        WEDDING PLANNER
                        Is there a problem?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I don't recognize half of these
                        names. 

                                        WEDDING PLANNER
                        The list came from Congressman
                        Stillson's Chief of Staff.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Why is there a camera crew listed?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS (O.C.)
                        Because the ceremony is going to
                        be televised.

          Senator Harlan Ellis enters the room.

                        Greg and I thought it would be a
                        good idea to reach out to the
                        people, make them feel like part
                        of the family.

                        Daddy, I don't want this turned
                        into a media circus.  I mean, is
                        this a wedding or a political
                          fundraiser?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        Both, if you we do it right. 
                                (off her look)
                        Honey, people have a vested
                          interest in Greg Stillson.  When
                        they look at him, they see the
                        future of this country.

                                        STILLSON (O.C.)
                        And the future looks fantastic!

          Miranda turns to SEE Stillson step up beside the very
          cute, very young Florist and helps her arrange a vase of
          lilies.  It's obvious he's flirting with her.

                                        STILLSON
                                (re: lilies)
                        These are my absolute favorites. 
                        So delicate and unspoiled.

          The young woman seems embarrassed as she quickly moves
          away.  Stillson turns his attention towards Miranda.

                                        STILLSON
                        There's my girl!
                                (kiss on the cheek)
                        We're really going to do this,
                        aren't we?

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        It's turning in to the social
                        event of the season.  The guest
                        list reads like a Who's Who of
                        beltway power brokers.

                                        MIRANDA
                                  (sarcastic)
                        I hope we can leave some standing
                        room for family and friends.

          Stillson picks up the guest list.

                                        STILLSON
                                (catches his eye)
                        You invited Congressman Kelly? 

          Stillson shoots Ellis a hard look.

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        It's tradition for a Junior
                          Congressman to invite his Senior
                          counterpart.

                                        STILLSON
                                  (irritated)
                        Tradition?  This sonofabitch has
                          traditionally blocked every piece
                        of legislation I've created. 
                        He's my biggest political
                        roadblock.  Now I have to feed
                        the fat bastard?

          Stillson unwittingly let's his dark side out in public. 
          He glances around, as the others look away.

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        If you don't invite him, people
                        will think...

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm afraid. 

          Then, like a true sociopath, his mood swings from anger
          to buoyant goodwill.

                                        STILLSON
                                (calming)
                        What the hell.  Daddy used to
                        say, keep your friends close and
                        your enemies closer.  Let's put
                          Congressman Kelly and his lovely
                        wife at table one.  How's that
                        sound, darlin'?

          He slips his arm around Miranda's shoulder. 

                                        MIRANDA
                        I'm not feeling very well.  I
                        think I'll lie down for a few
                          minutes.

                                        STILLSON
                        Want some company?

          Now it's Senator Ellis' turn to look away.

                                        MIRANDA
                        No.  I just need to rest, that's
                        all.

                        you see Dr. Knox?

                        It's nothing, daddy.  Excuse me.

          Miranda walks quickly away.

                                        STILLSON
                        Doctor Knox?

                          Miranda's doctor.  He's treated
                        her since she was a child.  Saved
                        her life.

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        Miranda suffered rheumatic fever
                        when she was a little girl.  The
                        illness damaged her heart.

                        She never mentioned it.

                                        SENATOR ELLIS
                        She wouldn't. 

          We see Stillson's look of concern, but over what?

                        particular conversation caught my
                        attention.  Apparently, the weekend
                        that Miranda Ellis disappeared,
                        you led a mass prayer service on-
                        line.

                        After she was found, the chat
                        room was buzzing with people
                          claiming that you'd performed a
                          miracle.  There were even some
                        saying you'd willed her rescue
                        through divine intervention.

                        Well, you know that the Internet
                        is populated by some rather dubious
                          characters.

                        I suppose.  The interesting thing
                        to me was that you never publicly
                        denied the claims.  Never attempted
                        to set the record straight.  Why
                        is that?

                        in the past ten months.  And it

          We see Purdy, a few local dignitaries and assorted
            officials and, standing in the back just about to turn
          away, we see Mister Janus.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Can you tell me his name?

          RESUME PURDY AND JOHNNY

          Purdy seems slightly unnerved.

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        His name is Janus.  Malcolm Janus.

                        What's his connection to Faith
                          Heritage?

                        He's a supporter.  Actually, he's
                        the one who first approached me
                        with the idea of taking the
                          ministry global.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where would I find this Mister
                        Janus?

                                        PURDY
                        We usually meet here.  Or at my
                        home.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He doesn't have an office?

                                        PURDY
                        I'm sure he does, I've just never
                        been there.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you know about Janus
                          personally?

                                        PURDY
                        He's a businessman.  He owns, or
                        runs several International
                        companies.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Owns or runs?

                                        PURDY
                        I'm not sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What kind of companies?

                                        PURDY
                        I'm not sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't know very much about
                        this man, do you?

                                        PURDY
                        I know he offered me the
                          opportunity to spread God's word. 
                        To carry His message and His
                          teachings to places and people
                        who'd otherwise be forgotten.  In
                        many ways, he's made my dreams
                        for Faith Heritage come true.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And what did he ask in return?

                                        PURDY
                          Nothing.  He's asked for nothing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It must be true what they say. 
                        You truly must be touched by God.

          Johnny exits and we see the look of conflict on Purdy's
          face.



          Senior Maine Congressman PAT KELLY, a larger-than-life,
            red-faced Irishman in the Tip O'Neill/Teddy Kennedy mold,
          and his Chief Assistant, MICHAEL SCANNELL, go over an
          upcoming press release.

                                        KELLY
                        It's important that we get out in
                        front of this thing.

                                        SCANNELL
                        It might be smart to restate our
                        commitment to Homeland Security.

                                        STILLSON (O.C.)
                        I don't know about Homeland
                          Security...

          Both men TURN, to REVEAL

          GREG STILLSON

          Standing in the open office doorway.

                                        STILLSON
                        But these offices could definitely
                        use some tightening up. 
                                (big smile)
                          Apparently, they'll let anybody
                        in.

          Kelly greets his young rival with the smiling insincerity
          of a career baby kisser.

                                        KELLY
                        Greg, my boy.  You know my door's
                        always open to an eager student
                        of the game.

    12CONTINUED:12

          Stillson smiles through the obvious shot at his
            inexperience.

                                        KELLY
                        You know Mike Scannell, my chief
                        aide.

                                        STILLSON
                        Of course.  I hear you're
                          considering a run for Mayor?

                                        SCANNELL
                        I'm weighing my options.  My
                          congratulations on your upcoming
                          wedding.

                                        STILLSON
                        Thank you.  I figured it was about
                        time I moved onto the national
                        scene.

                                        KELLY
                        How's that?

                                        STILLSON
                        Polls seem to indicate that a
                        wife and family is all I need to
                        swing the Southern states.

                                        KELLY
                        We talking about Pennsylvania
                        Avenue?

                                        STILLSON
                        If we are, you didn't hear it
                        from me.

                                        SCANNELL
                        I'll make sure we incorporate
                        these notes into the text. 
                                (to Stillson)
                          Congressman.

          Scannell exits, as Kelly fixes himself a drink.

                                        KELLY
                        Can I fix you a drink?

                                        STILLSON
                        No.  But you probably need one.

                                        KELLY
                        How's that?

                                        STILLSON
                        The press must be barkin' at your
                        heels over this newspaper article. 
                        Seeing how you're committee
                          chairman for Homeland Security. 
                        Any idea where the leak came from?

          It's obvious Stillson is enjoying Kelly's trouble.

                                        KELLY
                        My people are looking into it.

                                        STILLSON
                        It must be embarrassing,
                          considering how hard you fought
                        for that appointment?

                                        KELLY
                        You know, Greg, your arrogance is
                        one of the big reasons you're not
                        further along in your career.

                                        STILLSON
                        Is that right?

                                        KELLY
                        People will put up with an
                          unlikable leader as long as they
                        don't feel like they're being
                        sold down the river.  Your
                          desperate ambition for higher
                        office scares the average voter. 
                        Makes them feel like you don't
                        respect their needs.  I, on the
                        other hand, have no ambition beyond
                        the office I currently represent. 

                                        STILLSON
                        Let's cut to the chase.  You've
                        blocked every move I've made and
                        I'm tired of it.  I want it to
                        stop.

                                        KELLY
                        Or else?

                                        STILLSON
                        I can either help you through
                        this messy situation, or I can
                        step aside and let you get run
                        over.  The choice is yours.

                        You don't scare me, son.  Neither
                        does that cold-blooded phantom
                        that's pulling your strings. 
                        People around here don't like
                        outsiders.  Especially ones they
                        don't know.  So you go back and
                        tell your master that I said to
                        go straight to Hell.

          Stillson swallows his anger and heads for the door,

                        Donna and I look forward to the
                          wedding!

          Stillson blows out the door, as Kelly slugs down the rest
          of his whiskey.  His face reads more concern than he's
          willing to admit.



          Stillson slips into the back and slams the car door shut.

                        That's unfortunate.  Now we'll
                        have to do it the hard way.

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't care how you get it done,

                        It's already in the works.

                        that's not his real name, or he
                        really is a ghost.

          Johnny lingers on a photo of Miranda on the board,

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's real.  And from the way Purdy
                          reacted, dangerous.

          Johnny grabs the phone and dials.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (on the phone)
                        Miranda Ellis. -- When do you
                        expect her back? -- I realize
                        she's getting married tomorrow. --
                        No, there's no message.

          He hangs up.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe Walt can help?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The White House raised the
                          terrorist alert because of the
                        article in the paper.  He's out
                        at the oil refinery, helping with
                          security. 

          The phone RINGS.  Johnny picks up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello.

          Purdy stands looking out the window, his back to the door.

                        I've been thinking about our
                          previous conversation.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?

                        I made a few inquiries and came
                        up with an address.  Perhaps it
                        might help clear things up for
                        you.  Do you have a pen?

          Johnny scribbles down the information.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've got it.  Listen, Gene, I
                        want you to know how much... Hello? 



          Purdy hangs up, then HEARS...

                                        JANUS (O.S.)
                        It appears someone has their hand
                        in the cookie jar.

          Purdy looks up to REVEAL...

          JANUS

            Seemingly materialized out of thin air.  Purdy's sure he
          just heard him on the phone with Johnny.

                                        PURDY
                        I can explain.

                                        JANUS
                        The situation is crystal clear
                        from where I'm standing.

          He picks up the empty cookie jar off Purdy's desk.

                                        JANUS
                        You're out of those shortbread
                        cookies I enjoy so much.

          We see the look of relief wash across Purdy's face.

                                        PURDY
                          Cookies?  Of course.  I'll have
                        Mrs. Campion bake you a batch.

                        of great importance.

                                        PURDY
                        You need my help?

                                        JANUS
                        As you may know, Congressman
                          Stillson and I have grown quite
                        close since the unexpected death
                        of his father.

                                        PURDY
                          I wasn't aware.

                                        JANUS
                        In many ways he looks upon me as
                          a surrogate parent.  An advisor
                        in matters of both professional
                        and personal regard.

                        I see.

                                        JANUS
                        The Congressman is, at his core,
                          a simple man.  From humble
                          beginnings.  Therefore, he feels
                        himself inadequate in expressing
                        certain communications.  Matters
                        of the heart, for example.

                                        PURDY
                        Matters of the heart?

                                        JANUS
                        The Congressman has approached
                        me, in extreme confidence, and
                        asked that I put into words some
                          unexpressed feelings relating to
                        his bride-to-be.  Expressions
                        he'd have you recite at the
                          appropriate time.

                                        PURDY
                        Are we talking about wedding vows?

                        Vows?  God, no.  A testimonial. 
                          A public attestation of emotion.

          Janus takes out a sealed envelope and slides it across

          the desk in front of Purdy.  

                                        JANUS
                        At the Congressman's request, the
                          envelope should remain sealed
                        until the appropriate time.

                                        PURDY
                          I understand.

                                        JANUS
                        It's crucial that we each
                        understand our roles during these
                          turbulent days ahead.  And that
                        we weigh the consequence of our
                          actions.  Don't you agree?

                                        PURDY
                        I do.

                                        JANUS
                        I do indeed.

          He turns and heads towards the door.

          TIGHT ON JANUS' FACE

          With what appears to be the hint of a smile.

                                        JANUS
                        'Til death do us part, Reverend. 
                        Words we can all live by.

          And he's gone, as Purdy regards the mysterious envelope.



          Johnny and Bruce ENTER.  The place is empty.  No furniture,
          no desks, no computers, nothing.  Just phone wires.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure this is the address Purdy
                        gave you?

                        killed his father. 

          Johnny feels around, then leans down and touches a PHONE
          WIRE protruding from the wall.  WHOOSH!



          The place MORPHS into a functioning office.  Cubicles,
          computer stations with people working.  Or are they? 
          Observer Johnny walks down the line checking out each
          station and getting the weird feeling that there's actually
          nothing going on here.

          SERIES OF CUBICLES.  One YOUNG MAN has his feet propped
          up and is asleep.  Another GUY plays computer poker, while
          a YOUNG WOMAN does her nails and talks to a friend over

                        dollars an hour and we just sit
                        here doing nothing.  It's actually
                        pretty boring.

          Johnny reaches for the door handle, WHOOSH! 



          As the room MORPHS into a furnished space.  The chair
          behind the desk turns around, we see Janus.

                                        JANUS
                                (on a headset phone)
                          I believe the public has a
                          fundamental right to know if
                        they're being adequately protected
                        from terrorism.  I don't need to
                        remind you what's at stake here
                        for you personally?  How this
                        could affect your career?

          Janus circles the writer's byline from a Boston Telegraph
            newspaper article.  The writer's name is JEREMY TOMLIN.

                                        JANUS
                          I appreciate your concern for
                          national security, but if I were
                        you, I'd worry more about your
                        own.  Your career.  The safety of
                        your family.  These are very
                        fragile things. -- That's a wise
                          decision.  I'll expect to see the
                        story in Tuesday's edition.

          As Janus hangs up, WHOOSH!



          Johnny flashes out of the vision.

                        It's Janus.  He's the one who
                        leaked the security information
                        to the newspaper.

                        He was talking on the phone about
                        it.  He'd circled the name of a
                        Boston Telegraph reporter.  The
                        same reporter that broke the story
                        in today's paper.

                        Janus was the source of the leak,
                        you can bring him down.

                        You'll have to convince the
                          reporter to go public with his
                        name.

          They take off, as...



          5 OR 6 people talking on phones or working on computers. 
          JEREMY TOMLIN is on the phone.  He's casual, confident, a
          12-year veteran reporter.

                        with that mouth?

          He abruptly hangs up, as Johnny steps up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me...

          Jeremy holds up a finger, draws a bottle of Mallox from
          his desk drawer and guzzles it down.

                                        JEREMY
                        Ok.  Go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was wondering if I might speak
                        to you about the article you wrote?

                        I'm kidding.

          A copy boy, FERREL, steps up...

                        Jeremy, there's like a thousand
                        phone messages here from all over
                        the country.  Everybody wants...

                        for at least the weekend.  Go!

          The kid shuffles away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My name is John.

                                        JEREMY
                        Hello, John.  Good-bye John.

          He heads for the door.



          A cluttered home office.  Photos from his many assignments.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've had an exciting career.

                        hotel rooms.

          Johnny notices a framed photo of Jeremy and his wife.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your wife?

                        Karen.

          Johnny picks up the picture.  WHOOSH!

                        When's the baby due?

                          I didn't actually come here to do
                        the interview.

                                        JEREMY
                        You've wasted my time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're angry, I understand, but
                        there are things you don't know.

          Before Johnny can answer, KAREN TOMLIN, comes in with an
          arm load of freshly cut flowers.

                                        KAREN
                        Jer, we're out of topsoil.  Can
                        you... 
                                (stops, seeing Johnny)
                        I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you
                        had company.

                                        JEREMY
                        John Smith, this is my wife, Karen. 
                        John was just leaving.

          Jeremy opens the door.  Johnny steps out, then turns...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Time is running out.  I beg you
                        to reconsider.

                                        JEREMY
                          I can't.  I'm sorry.

          He closes the door on Johnny.



          Miranda is getting ready for bed, closing the French doors
          to the outside.  She pauses to look at her wedding dress
          lying across the sofa.  This should be the happiest time
          of her life, but it's anything but.  Suddenly, Stillson
          wraps his arms around her from behind, startling her.

                                        MIRANDA
                                (startled)
                        God.  You scared me.

          She realize he's wearing just pajama bottoms and a T-shirt.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What are you doing?

                                        STILLSON
                        What's it look like?

          He goes to kiss her, but Miranda pushes him away.

                                        MIRANDA
                          I can't.  I mean, we can't sleep
                          together the night before the
                          wedding.  It's bad luck.

                        Are you serious?

          She doesn't respond to his affection, as he steps back.

                                        STILLSON
                        What's wrong?

                                        MIRANDA
                        I saw the way you looked at that
                        girl today.  The way you look at
                        other women.

                                        STILLSON
                        You're angry because I looked at
                        a girl?  Darlin', men look at
                        pretty girls, it's what we do.

                                        MIRANDA
                        You do more than just look.

                        Don't treat me like I'm stupid.

          She pushes him away again, as tempers flare...

                                        STILLSON

                        Because I was afraid...

          She stops short of saying Johnny's name.

                        What?  Talk to me.

                                (beat)
                        I grew up surrounded by powerful
                        men.  My grandfather, my uncles...
                        My father.  Even as a little girl,
                        I knew there were other women. 
                        My mother knew it, too.  There
                        was an unspoken agreement. 
                          Whatever happened outside the
                        house, stayed outside.  I can
                        deal with certain things, but I
                        won't be made a fool of in public. 
                        That I can't accept.  Not even
                        for you.

          She holds Stillson's stare, he seems oddly touched by her
          honesty. 

                                        STILLSON

                        I don't want to talk about this.

          She tries to pull away, but he holds her tight.

          He exits.  Miranda starts for the bed, then notices his
          clothes scattered on the floor.  She crosses to pick them
          up and something drops of his pants pocket.  She picks it
          up,

          CLOSE ON: a diamond earring.  One.

          Miranda absorbs the moment, believing it belongs to one
          of the other women that Stillson so desperately denied.

            Suddenly, unexpectedly, she kisses him.  Johnny breaks
          away from her.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have done
                        that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.
                                (awkward beat)
                        I'll fix us some coffee.

          He steps away towards the kitchen, as Miranda regains her
          composure.          DEAD ZONE: "Forbidden Fruit" - ACT THREE - 9/12/05 - GREEN  34.

          Johnny and Miranda sit at the breakfast table drinking
          coffee.

                                        JOHNNY
                        His name is Janus.  Malcolm Janus.

                                        MIRANDA
                        What else did you find out about
                        him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not much I'm afraid, but I'm sure
                        he's the source behind the article
                        in the newspaper.  I tried to
                          convince the reporter to reveal
                        his name, but he refused.

                                        MIRANDA
                        That means we don't have any
                          leverage.  No way to force Janus
                        to back off from his threat.

          Johnny can see the look of hopelessness creep back into
          her eyes.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I haven't given up yet.

          Miranda gets up and moves to the window.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Maybe it's just as well.  What
                        would I tell everyone?

          Johnny joins her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell them the truth.  Tell them
                        that you don't love Stillson and
                        this was all a big mistake.

                        It's strange, but I almost felt
                        sorry for Greg tonight.  He seemed
                        so... damaged.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He killed his own father.  Don't
                        you ever forget that.  No matter
                        what happens, you have to remember
                        what he's capable of.

          She considers the warning, then looks out the window.

                        back and forth like this.  Promise
                        me you won't try to find me again. 
                        Please.

            Reluctantly, Johnny nods, as she gently kisses his cheek,

          She walks away, as Johnny hesitates, then notices something
          sitting on the counter.  He picks it up.

          Flashing out of the vision, Johnny recoils as if bitten
          himself.  He grabs for his phone and dials the number off
          the business card.

                                        JEREMY'S VOICE MAIL

                        can get there before it's too
                        late.

          Johnny grabs his car keys and takes off.



          We have an ACTION-TYPE DRIVING SEQUENCE.  Our rescue

          to Karen Tomlin before the snake bites her.

          silently up the staircase, as the SHOT REVEALS...

                        how his bride-to-be spent the
                        night before her wedding.



          Johnny steers the Rover towards a street corner, as he
            continues to try and contact Tomlin at home.

                        Come on, answer the damn...

          He stops as he suddenly notices,

          JOHNNY'S POV - JEREMY TOMLIN

          Tomlin is walking down the sidewalk towards the bakery. 
          They BOTH make EYE CONTACT as Johnny squeals the car around
          the corner and tears up the quiet residential street
          towards the Tomlin house.



          Miranda is in her wedding dress.  KATHLEEN, a young woman
          her own age, her MAID OF HONOR, fusses over her make-up.

                                        KATHLEEN
                        2 hours and counting.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Is that all?  I didn't realize it
                        was so late.

                                        KATHLEEN
                        You okay, sweetie?

          She doesn't look like a blushing bride, that's for sure.

                        Fine.  Just overexcited.

                        I could pull the car around back. 
                        We'd be in Canada before they cut
                        the cake.

                        It was a joke, honey.

          There's a knock at the door, as Kathleen answers, we see
          Stillson dressed in his wedding suit.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'd like to speak with Miranda.

                        Now?

          Stillson's eyes narrow, as he's about to unload.

                                        MIRANDA
                        It's okay, Katy.  Can you get me
                        some water?

                        Sure.  I'll be right back.

          She cuts Stillson a hard look and leaves.  Stillson steps
          in and closes the door.

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't think she likes me very

          steps up behind her, staring at her in the mirror.  It's
          creepy, as if he's trying to memorize her face.

          He sets his hand on the side of her neck, as if he might

                          remember that.*

          He kisses her on the neck, then walks out, passing Kathleen

          As we see the uncertain fear in her eyes.



          There are small cages with different types of deadly snakes
          in them.  There's a bigger cage, where there are about a
          dozen poisonous snakes slithering around.

          SMALL CAGE 

          A slick black snake identical to the one in Karen's garden,
          is grabbed behind the head by a LEATHER GLOVE.

          SNAKE MAN

            A rough-looking guy "milks" the snake of its venom, holding
          its fangs against the edge a small glass vial, as the
          bottom pools with deadly venom.

          Observer Johnny watches as a BIG MAN (we remember him as
          one of Stillson's/Janus' Security Men) watches from a few
          feet away.

                                        SECURITY MAN
                        So, it can't kill anyone now?

                                        SNAKE MAN
                        Not for a few hours.  Not until
                        it has a chance to produce more
                        venom.  It'll make you sick as a
                        dog though.  This particular venom
                        affects the heart.

          He slips the snake into a heavy canvas bag and hands it
          to Security Man, who hands the man a wad of cash.  We
          notice that he's wearing black leather gloves.

                                        SNAKE MAN

                        The venom?  I can't sell that to

                        this stuff can kill a person.  

                                        SECURITY MAN
                        I guess I'll have to take it then.

          Before the Snake Man can react, the Security Man hits him
          with a powerful forearm blow to the jaw, knocking him
            unconscious.  He grabs the guy by the back of his jacket
          and drags him to the door of the large cage, opens it and
          shoves the guy into the cage full of deadly snakes.  He
          locks the cage with a padlock (with gloved hands, thus
          leaving no fingerprints).  Then he takes the bagged snake
          and the vial of venom and leaves.

                        What happened?



          Johnny and Jeremy are talking.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think it was meant as a warning.

                                        JEREMY
                          Warning?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Somebody wanted to scare you. 
                          Somebody whose afraid you might
                        talk.

                                        JEREMY
                        You think my source did this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He knows there's pressure on you
                        to reveal his name.

                                        JEREMY
                        That thing could have killed my
                        wife... my child.

          We see the anger swell inside him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        People get nervous.  Lives are on
                        the line.  The question now is,
                        what will you do to protect
                          yourself?

          Jeremy hesitates, then reaches for the phone and dials...

                                        JEREMY
                                (on phone)
                        Andy, it's Jerry.  How quick can
                        you put together a press
                          conference?

          Johnny sighs as it appears he's finally going to take
          Janus down.  But will it be in time...



          Jeremy is there in a sport coat and tie, his LAWYER, his
          wife and several reporters with TV cameras.  Johnny and
          Bruce stand in the back.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's a good thing you kept that
                          business card.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The important thing is we get
                        Janus' name on the record as the
                        source of the security leak.
                                (checks his watch)
                          Miranda's scheduled to walk down
                        the aisle in less than an hour.

                                        BRUCE
                        Here we go.

          PODIUM

          Jeremy steps up to the makeshift podium.

                                        JEREMY
                        Thank you for coming on such short
                        notice.  I believe in the power
                        of the press.  I've dedicated my
                        life to it.  But my family hasn't. 
                                (looks over at his
                                wife)
                        There's a threat to our liberty,
                        but it's not from foreign
                          aggressors.  It comes from within. 
                        It saddens me to reveal a source
                        I've sworn to protect, but whom I
                        feel has betrayed that trust.  My
                          source's name is -- Michael
                          Scannell, Congressman Pat Kelly's
                        chief of staff.

          There's a flurry of excitement.  Johnny is shocked.

          FADE IN:


          CONTINUOUS

          Johnny and Bruce absorb the blow of Tomlin's public
            announcement.

                                        JEREMY
                        I don't know whether Congressman
                        Kelly knew or approved the leak. 
                          I assume an independent
                          investigation will determine his
                          culpability.  I'll take a few
                          questions now.

          B.G. CHATTER TO BE WRITTEN.

          The REPORTER standing next to Johnny shakes his head.

                                        REPORTER #2
                        This officially makes Greg Stillson
                        the luckiest man on earth.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Stillson?

                                        REPORTER #2
                        He's marrying a stone fox and his
                        number one political rival is
                        wiped out, all in the same day. 
                        This guy is unstoppable.

          He walks away, as Johnny realizes just how badly he's
          been duped.



          Johnny is driving with Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Janus wasn't blackmailing Jeremy
                        Tomlin.  It was Scannell.

                                        BRUCE
                        How?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He must have set him up or dug up
                        some dirt on him, something to
                        get him to go along with the idea.

                        I'm sure Scannell never knew who
                        he was dealing with, just a voice
                        on the phone.

                                        BRUCE
                        Janus used the snake to put the
                        fear of God into Tomlin, knowing
                        he'd name Scannell and bring down
                        Stillson's biggest political
                          obstacle in the process.  It's
                          actually brilliant.

                        And I helped him every step of
                        the way. 

          Johnny suddenly realizes,

                          Miranda.  It has to be Miranda.
                                (beat)
                        Hang on!

          Johnny whips a U-turn and tears up the street. 



          Miranda, in her wedding dress, stands at the window,
          looking out.

                                        JANUS (O.C.)
                        I hope you're not contemplating a
                        jump?

          Miranda turns to REVEAL...

          JANUS

          Dressed neatly in a classic black tuxedo.

                                        MIRANDA
                                (slight panic)
                        Where's Katy?

                                        JANUS
                          I believe she had an emergency
                        phone call.  A family matter.

          It's obvious he's set up this moment for them to be alone.

                                        JANUS
                        I don't believe we've formally
                        been introduced.

          He offers his hand, but Miranda ignores the gesture.

                                        MIRANDA
                        I know who you are.  I'd appreciate
                        it if you'd leave.

          She turns again to stare out the window.  Janus steps up
          behind her.

                          Weddings are one of those ancient
                        rituals I've never understood. 
                        Did you know that very few members
                        of the animal kingdom actually
                        mate for life? 

                                        MIRANDA
                        You'd be the expert on animal
                          behavior.

                                        JANUS
                        There's a tribe in Africa where
                        the bride's entire family enters
                        the sleeping hut the morning after
                        the wedding.  If there's no sign
                        of blood in the marriage bed, the
                        woman is dragged to the center of
                        the village and stoned to death. 
                        It's considered a sign of betrayal. 
                        It's fortunate civilization has
                        come so far, wouldn't you agree?

          She turns to face him.

                                        MIRANDA
                        Why are you here?

                                        JANUS
                        I bring a peace offering from the
                        groom.

          Janus draws a small box from his coat pocket and opens
          it.  We see TWO diamond earrings.  They are identical to
          the one that fell out of Stillson's pants pocket.  Miranda
          seems taken aback.

                                        JANUS
                        The Congressman had planned to
                        present them to you sooner, but
                        as fortune would have it, he
                          misplaced one of them.

          She suddenly realizes Stillson didn't lie to her.  That
          the earring she found was meant for her all along.  Now
          she's unwittingly become the betrayer.

                                        JANUS
                        I know how much it would mean to
                        him to have you wear them today.

          She takes them, as Janus steps to the door, then looks
          back at her.

                          Stunning.  Truly, stunning.

          He exits.  Miranda steps to the mirror, takes one of the
          earrings and removes the backing,

          CLOSE ON: the sharp silver post of the earring, shining
          like a deadly weapon as she slips it into the hole in her
          ear lobe.

          Miranda INSERTS the post into the hole in her lobe, as...

                        It seems unfathomable that such a
                        young, energetic woman could be
                        gone so suddenly.  As her family,
                          including grieving fianc 
                          Congressman Greg Stillson, honored
                        her last wish to have her ashes
                        spread on the ocean she loved so
                        much.

                        Miss Ellis suffered from a heart
                          condition as the result of a
                          childhood illness.  Unfortunately,
                        that heart proved too weak to
                        realize what should have been the
                          happiest day of her young life. 
                        Miranda Ellis was 24 years old.

          REVEAL JOHNNY

          Sitting on the sofa holding the remote.  Bruce is here,
          too.

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, dude.  You can't just
                        sit here all day.

          Johnny shows Bruce the front page of the BOSTON TELEGRAPH.

                                        JOHNNY
                        See this?  Congressman Kelly
                          resigned today.  They did it,
                        Bruce.  They did it all.

                                        BRUCE
                        Television says Miranda had a
                        heart condition.  Her father
                          confirmed it in the paper.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She was poisoned.  Why do you
                        think they had her body cremated
                        so fast?

                                        BRUCE
                        You should have gone to the police.

                                        JOHNNY
                        With what?  Visions?  These people
                        don't leave loose ends. 
                                (he grabs the paper)
                        Did you see this article?  It's
                        about how Stillson is seen as the
                          grieving fianc .  About how that
                        translates into votes.  You think
                        they didn't know that?!

          He throws the paper across the room, as the DOORBELL RINGS.

                        I'm not here.

          Bruce moves to the front door, then returns with Reverend
          Purdy...

                                        BRUCE
                        He's not here.  But if he comes
                        back, see if you can get him to
                        eat something.

          Bruce exits.  Purdy steps over and sits next to Johnny.

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        I owe you an apology.  I was
                        blinded my own ambition.  I never
                        in my wildest imagination thought
                        it would come to this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you talking about?

          Purdy takes out a familiar-looking envelope with a broken
          wax seal and sets it on the table.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is that?

                                        PURDY
                                  (emotionally distraught)
                        Janus came to see me a few days
                        ago.  He gave me this envelope
                        and told me I wasn't to open it
                        until the proper time.  He said
                        it was something he'd written for
                        Greg Stillson.  Something
                        concerning Miranda.

          This gets Johnny's attention.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Janus wrote something about
                          Miranda?

          Johnny goes for the envelope, but Purdy stops him.

                                        PURDY
                                (becoming upset and
                                  agitated)
                        It's not even his handwriting, I
                          checked.

                        What...

                                        PURDY
                        He'd just deny it.  There's no
                        way to prove it came from him. 
                        I've been over it a thousand times
                        in my head...

          Johnny grabs Purdy by the arm to settle him down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene.

                                        PURDY
                          I assumed it was something to do
                        with the marriage ceremony.  Then,
                        after Miranda... after she
                        collapsed, I opened it.

          Purdy is clearly on the verge of tears.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is it?  What's in the
                          envelope?

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        It's her eulogy.
                                (hushed rage)
                        The sonofabitch wrote Miranda's
                        eulogy two days before she died.

          As they sit in stunned silence, we go the TITLE CARD.
