      A marble plinth, centre of the room.  On top, a two-handled
      medieval drinking cup.  Solid shining gold, encrusted with
      glinting jewels.  This is the CUP OF ATHELSTAN.

      standing outside the fence, all facing out.

      Silence.  Guards on duty.

      PAN up the room, from the PLINTH & FX BEAMS, to... 

      The ceiling.  A panel slides open, silently -  

      Staring down: a WOMAN in a black catsuit, mask covering
      all but the eyes.  This is CHRISTINA.

      She stares down.  Clever, calculating eyes.

      Then she draws back, into darkness for a second...

      Then launches through the gap!  Her entire body whipping
      through, not touching the sides -

      She whizzes down, like she's falling to her death -

      Then stops!  She's on a wire, suspended through the gap
      above; she's hanging vertically, head lowermost.  She's
      stopped about two feet above the cup.

      Looks round.  Silence.  Guards facing out, not noticing.

      Christina reaches up.  She's got a black bag attached to
      her waist.  She unclips it.  Reaches down, the black bag
      in one hand, the other hand reaching for the Cup...

      She lifts up the Cup.  Puts the black bag in its place... 
      And as she whips the black bag off - not revealing what's
      inside yet, cut to CU Christina -

      She stares at the Cup.  Victory!

      Reaches to her waist, where there's a control for the wire
      & OOV winch, presses a button -

      One guard shifts, bored, turns round...

      Now standing on the plinth: one of those tacky Chinese
        gold-plastic cat ornaments, with a waving arm.

      It waves.

                    It's gone.  Right in front of me. 
                    The bus has just... gone.  Over. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The final shot of sc.21 on a crackling VIDEO SCREEN.  Shot
      tight, but all around: darkness & strange technology.

      2 FIGURES foreground, obscure.  They talk in angry chirrups:

                    <Chirp chap!  Chirrup!!>

      He lifts a threatening hand to the screen, pointing out
      the bus; an alien hand, covered in wiry, black INSECT HAIR.

                    Ohh, that's special, Lou, that is

                    Just think of them.  Cos that planet
                    out there, all three suns and
                    wormholes and alien sand, that
                    planet is nothing.  D'you hear me? 
                    Nothing, compared to all those
                    things waiting for you.  Food and
                    home and people, hold on to that.

                    Right.  Fine.  But before I die of
                    old age - which in my case would
                    be quite an achievement, so
                      congratulations on that - is there
                    anyone else I can talk to?

                                      MALCOLM
                    No, but listen!  I set the scanner
                    to register what it can't detect
                    and inverted the image.

                                  Writer's 
      Malcolm's screen: GRAPHICS of wormhole measurements - bar-
      charts, oscilloscope-type lines, etc. 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You did what?
                  The 
                                      MALCOLM
                    Is that wrong?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, Malcolm, that is brilliant! 
                    So you can actually measure the
                      wormhole?!  Okay, I admit, that is
                    genius!

                                      MALCOLM
                    The Doctor called me a genius.

      A SHORT CORRIDOR, leading to the main section.  The ship's
      been shattered; dark metal girders criss-crossing the way,
      pipes and tubes hanging down; the floor's cracked open,
      sand underfoot.  Sunlight through holes in the roof.

      THE DOCTOR & CHRISTINA walking along, at gunpoint, with

      A second Tritovore, PRAYGAT, is waiting.  He wears the

      FX SHOT: PROJECTION of DMP, SAN HELIOS CITY.  A beautiful
      Aztec-type city of ziggurats and walkways.  Intimate moment:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    San Helios City...

                                      CHRISTINA
                    That's amazing.  But... you've
                    seen this sort of thing before,
                    haven't you? 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Thousands of times.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    That Lordship of yours...  The

                    Lord of where, exactly?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Of Time.  I come from a race of
                    people called Time Lords.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    You're an alien?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yeah.  But you don't have to kiss
                                  Writer's 
                    me either.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    You look Human.

                    Anyway!

      Back to work!  Of the projection:

                                      CHRISTINA
                    So!  If that's San Helios, then
                    all we need to do is find that
                    city.  They can help us!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I don't think it's that simple...

                    We're in the city.  Right now.

                    ...but it's sand.  That first image,
                    the temples and things, what's
                    that, then?  Ancient history?

                    I said there was something in the

                    the wildlife.  And a hundred billion
                    people.  Turned to sand.  All those
                    voices in Carmen's head.  She's
                    hearing them die.

                    It's the wormhole, Doctor, it's
                    getting bigger!  We've gone well
                    past one hundred Bernards, I haven't
                    invented a name for that.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    How can it get bigger by itself?

                    We kept on turning the engine,

                    it all up.  Even if we can get

      Silence.

                    They've got bones of metal!  They
                    eat metal, extrude it into the exo-
                    skeleton!  So their velocity makes
                    the wormhole, then their body makes
                    it safe!  Perfect design!

                    Ten miles up, they fell out of the

                    Yup.  But wait a minute... that's

                    Oh, don't you wish?

      She presses the winch-control on her waist.  Starts
      descending down the shaft...

      And as she keeps sliding down - slowly, with every shot -
      the Doctor settles by the Well; intimate, over comms:

                    Lady Christina de Souza.  Carrying

                    No stranger than you, spaceman.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I had this friend, once.  She called
                    me spaceman.

                                      CHRISTINA

                    It's the Cup of Athelstan.  Given
                    to the first King of Britain, as a
                      coronation gift from Hywel, King
                    of the Welsh.  But it's been held
                    in the International Gallery for

                    No no no, if you're short of cash,
                    you rob a bank.  Stealing this...

      head-first through the bottom of the Well, in the roof.  A
