                        "Finn the Silent."  As he was
                        known.  A riddle to all who knew
                        him.  And to himself as well.

                        have imagined.

          The noise is deafening.  Our POV retreats behind a pillar
          as the roar bleeds into a MORE BESTIAL ROAR coming from --



          Another subway train roars into the station.  This time
          we peer out from behind the pillar, watch the doors open,
          then tentatively make our way toward them.

          Then our POV PANS to a spiral drawing pad on a tray table
          in front of us.  We hear the scratch of a felt-tip marker
          as we take in several COMIC BOOK-STYLE PANELS, each deftly
          drawn, depicting the scenes we've just seen, including:

          - The beautiful narrator's face emerging from the darkness.

          - Finn making his way through the dark woods, lighting
          his way with a magic amulet that he wears around his neck.

          - A DRAGON roaring from a rocky cave as Finn hides.

          CAMERA pans across the panels as the NARRATOR continues:

                        And on this most important journey
                        he was alone.  His path leading

          Panning now to that same bus timetable, now propped atop
            a DRAWING that suggests an ANCIENT PARCHMENT MAP.  The
          cities in the time table have been transformed into
            whimsical place names along a treacherous route that winds
          over mountain ranges and rivers. 

            Suddenly, another woman's voice interrupts the scene.

                                        50ISH WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?  Is that your knapsack?

          The sound of drawing pauses; our POV freezes; music and
            narration stop.

                                        50ISH WOMAN (O.S.)
                        I asked if this seat is taken?

          PANNING across the map to a province called BANGORIA, and
          within it to a little hamlet called CLEAVES MILLS.  A
          felt-tip sketches in a nearby river as the narrator also

          LIVING ROOM REDRESS)

          A small group of mourners, several more officers in dress
          blues, including a young man (MITCH STANTON, 30ish) who
          puts a comforting hand on Ryan's shoulder.  A priest is
          reciting a prayer near an open coffin (in which we may
          see the profile of the deceased woman:  Ryan's wife IRENE;
          if not, there's a WREATH from the Boston Police Detectives
          Benevolent Association with the name "Irene Fallon"). 
          But the boy's attention remains strangely fixed on that
          piece of fraying gold braid.

          Off Johnny, observing this...          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ONE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 6.


  1414RESUME ON JOHNNY

          As he comes out of the vision just long enough to see the
          boy now studying him, as though Johnny's distraction has
          emboldened him.  Then Johnny's plunged back into --


          TABLE AS WE SLOWLY DOLLY IN ON --

          Ryan Fallon, who stands staring at us, flanked by his
          lawyer on one side and Johnny on the other, as an O.S.
          Judge bangs a gavel to silence a noisy crowd.  Then -- 

                                        JUDGE (O.S.)
                        You've heard the sentence of this
                        court.  In accordance with that
                          sentence, at a date and time to
                        be determined, you will be taken
                        to a place of execution and put
                        to death by lethal injection. 
                        May God rest your soul.

          Off Johnny...



          Widening to find him sitting with a dozen people facing a
            curtained window, as the curtain goes up to reveal Fallon
          strapped to a gurney in an execution chamber (this can be
            a redress of police observation room/interrogation room
          set we'll use later).  CAMERA pushes through the window
          to Fallon, just as a Corrections Officer pushes a button,
          sending an anesthetic coursing through an IV into his
          arm, and his eyes close with an expression of resignation.


  1818RAMPING OUT OF JOHNNY'S EYE - PRESENT

          As he comes out of the vision, eyes the piece of braid in
          his hand, then the boy, who's once again avoiding his
          gaze.  Johnny crouches in front of him.

                        me to touch this?

          Johnny tries to make eye contact, but the boy keeps looking
          away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You could at least look at me.

          As he grips the boy's arm, the kid reacts, stiffening.


1919A SERIES OF P.O.V. FLASHES (VISION) - NIGHT

          Unlike the previous visions, these have a surreal quality,
          emphasizing physical details and patterns over context
          and narrative, like visual non sequiturs:


          SHADOWS SKITTER ACROSS A GRAFFITI-TAGGED WALL

          And then the various graffitos are isolated, transcribed
          and re-arranged on the wall in alphabetical columns.


2020A BRIGHT SILVER DISK WITH FAINT MARKINGS

          Gleams amidst a handful of similar flattened disks of
          various size, all set against a rectangular bed of dark
          angular stones.  Suddenly, the flattened disks "rise"
          like baking bread, becoming COINS:  quarters, nickels,
          dimes and pennies.  Next the screen splits into two
          columns: on one side, the handful of coins are sorted by
          value and tallied; on the other side, the stones are
          arranged into an abacus-like grid and tallied as well.

  2222RESUME

          Johnny releases the boy's arm and falls back on his ass
          like he's received a shock.  The boy reacts just as
          violently, scrabbling backwards to a corner of the landing,
          where he begins to moan and rock uncontrollably. 

          Off Johnny's alarm and confusion, TIME CUT TO:          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ONE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 8.



          Calm now, the boy, his jacket off, pokes around in the
          dining room, opening china cabinets and studying the
            contents, then scribbling in his drawing pad.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Thanks for answering my 9-1-1. 
                        How'd you calm him down?

          Pulling back to find him watching with BRUCE from the
          doorway to the kitchen.

                                        BRUCE
                        I've had a little experience with
                          autistic kids.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Autistic?

                                (off Johnny's look)
                          Aversion to eye contact.  Being
                          touched.  Obsessive rhythmic

                        Usually there's a language problem.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What language?  He hasn't said a
                        word since he got here.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's extreme.  Autistic kids
                        who can't communicate usually
                        aren't independent enough to be
                        out on their own.

                        He managed to track me down. 
                        Even seems to know how my visions
                        work.

                        He did his homework.  Take a look.

            Revealing WALT laying out some of the items from the boy's
          knapsack on the kitchen counter, including a bunch of
          tabloid newspaper clippings.  As Johnny and Bruce come
          over, he indicates one--a Boston Guardian story on Johnny.

                        Guess that's where he's from.

                        Bus ticket.  One way from South

                        He's circled two stories.

          Johnny and Walt look at the clipping.  Right next to a
          story about Johnny is a headline that reads, "Ex-cop's
          Appeal Denied; Death Sentence Upheld."  Below it is a
          picture of Ryan Fallon in a police uniform.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the guy I saw in my vision.

                                        WALT
                        You sure?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know him?

                              (a vital distinction)
                        I know of him.  Remember that
                        corruption scandal in the Boston
                        P.D. about five years back?  This
                        guy set it off when he shot and
                        killed an undercover federal agent.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's a dirty cop.

                          I didn't think Massachusetts had

                        jumping into.  Corruption charges
                        tend to get the rank and file a
                        bit edgy.

          Johnny glances again toward the dining room.

          He exits as Johnny and Bruce cross toward the dining room. 
          Only Thaddeus, as we'll now call him, is gone.

          Bruce and Johnny enter from the living room.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll look upstairs, you check
                        down here.

          He bounds up the stairs.  Johnny starts to walk down the
          long foyer, calling out:

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus?

          Then he turns, notices a door under the stairs that's

          partly open, a bit of light spilling out.  He approaches.


          ANGLE ON DOOR

          As Johnny opens it to reveal Thaddeus huddled in a corner
          of the closet-like space, drawing on his pad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There you are.

          He crouches again, this time keeping a little distance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        See you found my old hidin' place. 
                        I used to hole up here for hours
                          whenever I wanted to be alone. 

          Thaddeus doesn't look up at him, just swaps one colored
          felt tip for another and continues drawing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's "Thaddeus," right?  That
                        gold braid, it was your dad's,
                        wasn't it?
                                (beat)
                        I guess you knew I'd figure that
                        out.

          Still no response.  Johnny sighs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We'll get in touch with your
                        family.  They'll probably let you
                        stay here tonight.  But tomorrow
                        we've got to get you home.

          Thaddeus seems to nod, or maybe he's just rocking slightly,
          as we push in on his drawing pad, beginning --


2525A COMIC BOOK MONTAGE

          Dynamic macro photography, the kind Ken Burns used to
          make Civil War photographs come alive, turns a series of
          Thaddeus's comic book panels into a little story.

          Once again, the beautiful narrator's face hovers over a
          dramatic "establishing shot" of a tiny horse-drawn cart
          making its way through a snowy mountain pass.

                        Fortune smiled on young Finn,
                        making allies of Eldgar and his
                        trusted apprentice...

          As another panel reveals the cart's three passengers: the
          tall white-robed Wizard, his short, pointy-eared
          Apprentice, and young Finn seated between them.  We might
          note that Finn's companions bear a more than passing
          resemblance to Johnny and Bruce.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        ...a fellow who was rarely silent
                        on the journey back to Finn's
                        home.

          And over a final CU comic image of a chatty, gesticulating
            Apprentice/Bruce, we hear:

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        Yo Thad, check this out.



          As he fiddles with a NAVIGATION UNIT mounted on the dash. 
          Thaddeus is in back, drawing as he repeatedly hums an ODD
          LITTLE MELODY -- which seems to be getting to Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        ... with a GPS locator to light
                        the way.  State-of-the-art
                          technology.

          He gets back in the car, handing Bruce a folded map with
            a circled destination.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was right, we're lost.

                        That's where we should be. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Sorry, I was distracted.  That
                        little ditty he keeps humming is
                        about to drive me crazy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now it's his fault you can't
                        operate that thing?  That's
                        desperate, even for you.

                                        BRUCE
                                (glancing back)
                        Doesn't seem to be stopping his
                        art work.

          Johnny has an idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus -- can I see your
                          drawings?

          Thaddeus lets him take the pad.  Johnny studies the
            drawings, which include panels we saw in the montage, as
          well as new scenes involving elves, trolls, dragons, etc.

                                        JOHNNY
                        These are good.  You even made up
                        your own language.

          He indicates a panel that shows Eldgar and his apprentice.

                                        JOHNNY
                        "The wizard and his apprentice."

          Bruce glances back at the pad.

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you saying that freaky little

                        Remarkably life-like.

                        Uh-uh!  No way!  I'm no "elf."

                                        JOHNNY
                          Tolkien's elves were immortal.

          Johnny hands Thaddeus his pad.

          Bruce starts the car, grousing to himself.

                        Just never seen no black elf,

  2727OMITTED



          CALLIE FALLON, Ryan's younger sister, an attractive but
          perpetually frazzled single mom in her 30s, crosses to
          the front door, glaring at her oblivious preteen twin
          sons, who are noisily playing a violent video game.

          She opens the door, ushering Johnny and Bruce in.

                                        CALLIE
                        Hi... I'm... Jesus, Thad, you had
                        us going nuts.

          Without so much as a glance, Thaddeus walks past her,
          heading for his room.

                                        CALLIE
                          Thaddeus!  I'm talking to you!
                                (turning back to Bruce
                                and Johnny)
                        I'm sorry you had to drive all
                        the way down here.  House is a
                          disaster zone, I can offer you
                        some coffee before you head back.

          She turns toward the twins, her voice cutting through the
          video mayhem.

          Callie pours some coffee.

                        My own kids I can barely handle... 
                        But Thad?  Running away like this. 
                        It's just too much.

                                        BRUCE
                        Can't you get him some help?

                        Aides cost money, and I'm the
                        only one paying the bills.  After
                        I heard from you, I called Social
                          Services.

                        You're giving him up?

                        The State has places for kids
                        like him.  Maybe he'd even be
                          happier.

          Johnny and Bruce trade glances.  Callie instantly gets
          defensive, picking up toys and chucking them in a box.

                                        CALLIE
                        You have no idea what it's like. 
                        Dealing with an autistic kid is a
                        24-7 job.  I have my own children

                        That's when he started to shut

                        the papers.  I guess he thinks
                        you're some kind of super hero.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus.  I'm afraid we have to
                        go.

          Thaddeus crawls under his bed...

                                        CALLIE
                          Thaddeus?

          ...only to wriggle out a moment later holding a cigar
          box.  He opens it, takes out a baseball and holds it out
          to Johnny.  Johnny looks at Callie, who shrugs.  He takes
          the ball.  WHOOSH! 



          Johnny watches from a doorway as Ryan and his wife, IRENE,
          30, argue, Ryan brandishing the same baseball.

                                        RYAN
                        I can't even play a simple game
                        of catch with him! 

                                        IRENE
                        Maybe if you tried to connect
                        with his interests.

                                        RYAN
                        Don't you get it?  There is no
                        connecting with him.

                                        IRENE
                        You need to be patient. 

                                        RYAN
                        How can you be patient with a
                        goddamn zombie?! 

          She slaps him across the face.

                                        RYAN
                                (beat)
                        The other guys have sons... I had
                        so many things I wanted to teach
                        him.

                                        IRENE
                        Maybe he's here to teach you. 
                        Like how to be a real father.

          She walks away as Sean considers the baseball, then dumps
          it in the trash as Johnny hears a noise, then looks down
          and sees a YOUNGER THADDEUS (8) huddled in the hallway,
          just out of sight, rocking and quietly moaning.


  3434RESUME - AS JOHNNY TURNS TO CALLIE

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did Ryan and Thaddeus get along?

          She's a little taken aback.

                                        CALLIE
                        My brother's a cop, from a family
                        of cops.  He couldn't accept having
                        a son with Thad's... limitations.

          Thaddeus is now holding out a small black plastic ball. 
          Johnny takes it, unsure what it is at first -- until he
          turns it around and sees a white-etched manual shift
          pattern.  It's a car's gear shift knob.  WHOOSH! 



          The KNOB now mounted on the stick shift of Irene Fallon's
          ancient VW.  Her hand comes into frame, shifts the lever
          into third, as we tilt up to see her looking at the road
          ahead.  Our POV is that of a child in the passenger seat.







                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ONE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 20.


    35CONTINUED:35

          She looks at us and smiles:  an angelic face beaming down,
          framed by a halo of sunlight.  (And by now we may recognize
          her face as that of "Irime," the narrator of Thaddeus's
          comics.  It's his mother's voice that we've been hearing
          as well -- Thaddeus's way of preserving her memory). 
          Then she reaches for the knob again.  Only now it comes
          off in her hand.  She stares at it for a beat, flustered,
          then looks up as an oncoming truck's BRIGHT LIGHTS blind
          her.  She throws her right arm against us as there's a
            sickening CRASH! 



                                        JOHNNY
                        It's from the crash.

                                        CALLIE
                                (creeped out)
                          I didn't know he had that.

          Thaddeus holds up one last item:  A FLATTENED NICKEL. 
          And for a moment he actually meets Johnny's eyes.  Johnny
          takes the squished coin and is again jolted into --


    3737REPRISE:  WEIRD P.O.V. FLASHES

          Again we see the wall of graffiti with the graffitos
          rearranging themselves.


  3838NEXT, THE UNDULATING RIBBONS OF LIGHT. 

          Only now we tilt up to see a wriggling, amoeba-like black
          shape silhouetted against a brighter light. 


    3939FINALLY, WE SEE THE FLATTENED COINS WINKING ON THE BED OF
          STONES --

          As this time a SHADOW falls over them.


  4040RESUME

          Again, Johnny comes out of the vision to find Thaddeus
          humming the ODD MELODY again, almost as if he's trying to
          make a point.  But whatever it is, Johnny doesn't get it.

                                        BRUCE
                        What'd you see that time?




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ONE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 21.


    40CONTINUED:40

                                        JOHNNY
                        More weird images... like before.

          Callie's patience has run out.  Firmly:

                                        CALLIE
                        I need you both to go now.

          Johnny stands, moves to the door with Bruce.  He takes a
          last look at Thaddeus, but the boy is already drawing a
          new comic, humming the odd little tune as he works.



          Through one-way glass, we see Johnny and Bruce being
            interrogated by the two cops who picked them up.  On our
          side of the glass, we see the REFLECTIONS of two other
          cops:  Mitch Stanton, a young and likeable plain-clothes
            narcotics detective (think a young David Caruso, tough
          but sensitive), and his older, laconic supervisor, LT.
          DOBBS.  Dobbs smokes.

                                        DOBBS (O.S.)
                        Wise use of taxpayer dollars.

                                        STANTON (O.S.)
                        I said I'd look after his family.

                                        DOBBS (O.S.)
                        You're taking loyalty too far.

                                        STANTON (O.S.)
                        Man was my partner.

                                        DOBBS (O.S.)
                        And he almost took down this
                          division.

          Camera pulls back to reveal the two men.

                                        STANTON
                        It's against the law to smoke
                          indoors.

                                        DOBBS
                        You're a cop.  Arrest me.

          One of the other cops, Duffy, the guy who told Johnny and
          Bruce to get in the van, pokes his head in.

                                        DUFFY
                        They claim the kid came to them,
                        they were just takin' him home.
                                (indicates Johnny)
                        When I uncuffed blondie, he said
                        my wife wasn't coming back.  Claims
                        he gets "visions" off touching
                        things.

    42CONTINUED:42

                                        STANTON
                        Think he's for real?

                                        DUFFY
                        You met my wife.  Hell, I pray
                        he's for real.

                                        STANTON
                        Let's see.

          Stanton takes out a key chain with some sort of "charm"
          attached -- a squashed, gold-plated bullet.  Off which...



          Stanton enters, Dobbs and Duffy behind him, and immediately
          tosses Johnny the key chain.  WHOOSH! 



          POV ANGLE of a drug buy going down - a GUY handing a bag
          of drugs to ANOTHER GUY in an SUV.  Pull back to find
          Johnny crouched beside Fallon and Stanton as they observe
          through the gap between a big truck and its cab.

                                        STANTON
                        We should call for back up.

          Fallon gives him a disdainful glance. 

                                        FALLON
                        More than you can handle, rookie?

          Stanton looks pissed, but racks the slide of his gun.


          NEW ANGLE

          Johnny now revealed watching from this angle as Fallon
          and Stanton descend on the two men.  Stanton goes for the
          man who was standing beside the truck and is now walking
          away.  Fallon sticks his gun in the driver's open window.

                                        FALLON & STANTON
                        Police!  Freeze!  [etc.]

          Stanton slams his man against a truck, his eyes briefly
          off Fallon, who yanks open the door of the SUV.

                                        FALLON
                        Get out!

          But as he opens the door, he sees A THIRD MAN reflected
          in the SUV's sideview mirror.  He's just stepped out of a
          loading dock door, aims a cannon-like .357 at Fallon.  As
          Fallon turns, staring into point blank death, a shot rings
          out...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ACT TWO - 6/20/05 - BLUE-2  24A.


    44CONTINUED:44

          ...and the man falls as he fires, a bullet intended for
          Fallon burying itself in side of the SUV.  Fallon and
          Johnny turn to see Stanton's gun smoking, his perp already
          cuffed.  As Stanton and Fallon lock eyes...



          Johnny looks at the squashed bullet, then at Stanton.

                        You saved his life.  Detective
                          Fallon's.

          The cops react, as surprised as anyone would be.

                                        STANTON
                        And he's saved mine.  Guess I'm a
                        little over-protective where his
                        kid's concerned.  You're free to
                        go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What if we could help?  Your
                          partner, I mean.

                                        DOBBS
                        Ryan Fallon had his day in court.

                        What if we could find new evidence.

                                        DOBBS
                        I got real work to do.

          He gives Stanton a look that says "it's your headache"
          and exits.  Johnny tosses Stanton back his keys.

                                        JOHNNY
                        At the trial, Fallon said he was
                        framed.

                                        STANTON
                        You heard what my lieutenant said.

          He starts to usher them out, but Johnny hangs back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you really care about Ryan and
                          Thaddeus, you'll accept my offer. 
                        Either way, we're not going home.

          Stanton eyes Johnny, gauging his determination.  Then:

                                        STANTON
                        Ryan was like a father to me.  I
                        wanted to believe him.  More than
                        I've ever wanted anything.
                                (beat)
                        Just be careful where you poke
                        your nose.  You've seen what
                        happens when you get cocky.

4646A COMIC BOOK MONTAGE - SERIES OF IMAGES

          A "crystal eye" (Thad's variation on a crystal ball, in
          the form of a large jagged crystal) reveals a ragged man
          in a dungeon.  Eldgar/Johnny and Apprentice/Bruce make
          their way through a swamp toward a forbidding fortress. 
          Hellish souls rise out of the water, grasping for them
          with arms of mist -- only to miss the pair as they slip
          past under a spell of invisibility.

                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                          Eldgar's "crystal eye" revealed
                        the location of Finn's father: 
                        the dreaded Fortress of Maror. 
                        The trio decided to reconnoiter*
                        the fortress, only to be waylaid*
                        by the Kalmathari -- the hungry
                        souls of those already claimed by
                        Maror's dungeons.  Were it not
                        for a quickly cast spell of
                          invisibility, their own souls
                        would have joined their ranks.

          And off a comic book image of the watery demons, howling
          at being denied their prey...



          Ryan Fallon, looking older than in Johnny's earlier
          visions, sits at a small table with a box of legal folders. 
          He's a bitter and cynical man:  a cop schooled by the
          business end of the Justice system.  He stands as a guard
          admits Johnny and Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Detective Fallon?  My name's Johnny
                        Smith, this is my... associate,
                        Bruce Lewis.

          Ryan indicates two chairs on the other side of the table.

                                        RYAN
                        My lawyers said I should meet
                        with you.  My question is why?

          Johnny holds out the bullet key chain (sans keys).

                                        JOHNNY
                        A close friend sent us.

          Ryan eyes the key chain, surprised, then takes it.  WHOOSH! 



          The same bullet-key chain plops into Mitch Stanton's shot
          glass.  He turns as Ryan slides onto an adjacent stool.

                                        RYAN
                          Consider it a 24-carat thank you.

          Stanton fishes out the key chain, smiles.

                                        STANTON
                        Just doin' my job.

                                        RYAN
                        I got sloppy.  I have a feeling
                        you're gonna keep me on my toes...
                          partner.

                                        STANTON
                          Serious? 

                                        RYAN
                        It's up to you.

          He offers his hand, then pulls Stanton into a hug.  Pull
          back to reveal Johnny watching from another bar stool.



          Fallon fingers the key chain.

                                        RYAN
                        I think that hurt the most.  That
                        my partner could think I sold
                        out.

                                        BRUCE
                        He sent us here, didn't he?

                        You're here for the press.  Only
                        I'm not buying your "Dead Man

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm here because of Thaddeus.

                                        RYAN
                        Thad?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your son came to find me.

          Ryan's taken aback.  This doesn't quite compute for him.

                                        BRUCE
                        All the way to Maine on his own.

                                        RYAN
                        That's impossible... My son is...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Autistic.  I know.  He's also
                        your biggest supporter.  Now maybe
                        I can help you, maybe I can't. 
                        The question is:  What have you
                        got to lose?

          A beat, then Ryan nods.

                                        RYAN
                        What do you want from me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell me what happened that night.

                                        RYAN
                        Read the court transcript.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to hear it in my own way.

          He extends both his hands over the desktop, palms up.

                                        RYAN
                        You're kidding?
                                (to Bruce)
                        He's kidding, right?

          Bruce and Johnny stare back at him.  Ryan eyes Johnny's
          hands for a beat, then grasps them.  WHOOSH!          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - ACT TWO - 6/20/05 - BLUE-2  28A.



          Johnny releases Ryan's hands.

                                        RYAN
                        That's how it went down.  My hand
                        to God.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I believe you.

                                        RYAN
                        My lawyers don't even believe me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw it happen just like you
                        said.  Only problem, I saw it
                        from your perspective.  Someone
                        must've hit you from behind, but
                        I don't know who it was.

                                        RYAN
                        Welcome to the party.

                                        BRUCE
                        Any idea who framed you?

          Ryan rises from his chair and starts looking through one
          of his files.

                                        RYAN
                          A dealer I was after.  Slick
                        Russian named Boris Kujo.  Boris
                        has been coming up in the world. 
                        And he isn't shy about letting me
                        know.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - TWO - 3/8/05 - GREEN 31.

          He shows Johnny and Bruce an 8x10 PUBLICITY PHOTO of a
          smiling businessman posing at a construction site, flanked
          by a pair of hard-hatted architects, as he displays an
          ARTIST'S RENDERING of a finished office building.  It
          bears the message, "Thinking of you.  Xoxo Boris."

                                        RYAN
                        Cute, huh?  Guy's turning into
                        another Donald Trump.  Two new
                        office buildings downtown.  Another
                        I can see going up from my cell.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Could WE find him there?

          Ryan shakes his head.

                                        RYAN
                          Publicity photos are one thing. 
                        When it comes to real work, Kujo
                        doesn't get his hands dirty.
                                (eyes the photo)
                        Mitch can track him down.

          Off the photo of the smiling Kujo...

          Kujo's studying the wine list when Stanton slides into
          his booth.  Kujo frowns.  Stanton smiles.

                                        STANTON
                        Your date's taking her time in
                        there, Boris.  Hope she's not
                        doing all your coke.

          Now it's Kujo who smiles.

                                        KUJO
                        I don't engage in illegal
                          activities.  I'm a businessman. 
                        Just ask your ex-partner.

          Stanton tenses.  Clearly no love lost between these two. 
          He nods O.S. and Johnny and Bruce, who've been pretending
          to study a menu by the door, approach.

          But first a THUGGISH BODYGUARD moves from another table
          to intervene.  Kujo waves him off.  To Stanton:

                                        KUJO
                        If you'd warned me, I would've
                          reserved a bigger table.

                                        STANTON
                        Detectives Smith and Lewis. 
                        They're working a case with me.

          Johnny extends his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mister Kujo.  I've heard a lot
                        about you.

                                        KUJO
                        And I've heard nothing about you.

          Kujo eyes his hand, then reluctantly grips it.  WHOOSH! 



          Johnny comes out of the vision, nods to Stanton.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was nice meeting you.  Maybe
                        we'll see each other again.

          They head off.  Kujo looks after them, then eyes Stanton.

                                        KUJO
                        What the hell was that?

          Stanton shrugs, a little confused himself but covering.

                                        STANTON
                        You're more popular than you
                          thought.

          As Kujo turns to look after Johnny and Bruce again, still
          puzzled and now a little uneasy...



          Callie opens the door, not happy to see Johnny and Bruce.

                                        CALLIE
                          I thought you two left town.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to speak to Thaddeus.
                                (off her look)
                        It's important.



          Thaddeus sits on his bed hugging his knees.  Though he
          doesn't look up when Johnny and Bruce enter, Callie
            anxiously following, we sense he was expecting them.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus, I need you to look at
                        me.

          Thaddeus slowly looks up, but not directly at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were there that night.  You
                        saw what happened.

          Thaddeus ducks his head again... or was it a nod?  In any
          case, we sense an admission.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - TWO - 3/9/05 - GOLD 35.

          Callie's confused and alarmed.

                                        CALLIE
                        What are you saying?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus was a witness.  He knows
                        who set his father up.

          Off which...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                          Thaddeus, where did you get that?

          But Thaddeus just continues to hold it out, again humming
          the ODD MELODY.  Johnny takes the shield -- WHOOSH! 



          Johnny eyes the badge in his hand, then looks at Thaddeus,
          who once again turns away.  Johnny turns to Callie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your brother was framed.  But to
                        prove that, I need Thaddeus.

          Off Callie, conflicted...



          Bruce and Stanton following Johnny and Thaddeus's looks. 
          (Note: in real life, as opposed to the vision, there is
          no freight car here; just an empty section of track.)

                                        STANTON
                        Could you see him?  The killer, I
                        mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (still in the vision)
                        His back's to me.  Wait, he's
                          turning.


  8181IN THE VISION

          The man indeed turns, as if sensing eyes on him.  But
          before we can see his face, both Thaddeus and his younger
          vision-self duck down, scrambling under the freight car.


          UNDER THE FREIGHT CAR - VISION

          Johnny finds himself crouching with both boys, their
            attention now fixed on a scattering of flattened coins,
          now clearly left on the tracks by kids, resting atop the
          angular stones of the rail bed.  But as Younger Thaddeus
          picks up a shiny squished nickel, a man's shadow falls
          over the other coins.  They freeze, and Johnny turns to
          see the killer's legs just a few feet away.

          Suddenly the killer's cell phone rings -- a distinctive
            "melodic" ring tone.  The distraction allows Younger
          Thaddeus to scramble away, ending the vision.



          Thaddeus sets his pad and markers on the kitchen table as
          Johnny spies another pink post-it on a pantry door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Follow the pink Post-its.
                                (plucks it, reads)
                        Tomato Soup.  Also one of my
                          personal favorites.

          CLOSE ANGLE as his HAND opens the cabinet door.  We hear
          a WHOOSH as a shelf of identical tomato soup cans is
            revealed.  Then ANOTHER MAN'S HAND GRABS A CAN.

                                        RYAN (O.S.)
                                (to phone)
                        Kid, it's me.

    84CONTINUED:84

          PULLING BACK to reveal we're in --



          Ryan, a phone receiver cradled on his shoulder, is leaving
            a message as he makes lunch for Younger Thaddeus, who is
          again drawing while Johnny, seated beside him, observes.

                                        RYAN
                        Just got a tip that Kujo's
                        personally brokering a sale
                          tonight.  South Station rail yard. 
                        Hope you get this soon 'cause I
                        can't wait.  Mitch, I finally got
                        the bastard.

          He hangs up, ending the vision.


  8686RESUME ON JOHNNY

          Standing by the cabinet again, soup can in hand.  He looks
          over at Thaddeus, still drawing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He didn't think you'd understand,
                        much less follow him.  D'you take
                        the bus?

          Once again Thaddeus shows no sign he's listening, intent
          on his drawing.  Johnny pours the soup into a pot that's
          been left on the stove.

                                        JOHNNY
                        People keep underestimating you,
                        don't they?  That's gonna be their
                        last mistake.

          He then turns on the gas.  A vision WHOOSH merges with
          the whoosh of the flame as it ignites.  Johnny FREEZES.


          CU ON THADDEUS'S PAD - VISION

          Quick glimpses of various characters and scenes as we
          hear the scratching of his felt tip, the sound exaggerated
          in the still moment.  Then --


          BACK TO JOHNNY'S HAND

          Frozen on the gas knob, as suddenly his perspective rockets



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - THREE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 44.

          into the stove, down a gas line, and then to a GAS METER
          outside of the house, where a man in a gas company uniform --
          whom we recognize as Kujo's THUG from the restaurant --
          is doing something to the gas line.

          Our view rockets back the way it came, as Johnny now
            unfreezes as he turns to Thaddeus.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus! 

          That's as far as he gets before the stove EXPLODES IN A
          MASSIVE FIREBALL, the flash whiting out the screen! 


  8787RESUME - JOHNNY AT THE STOVE

            Realizing it's all been a vision, and yet he's already
          turned on the gas and knows he has barely a second to
          act.  This time he just grabs Thaddeus, who screams as
          Johnny rushes out just as the room EXPLODES behind them!



          Is thrown to the floor, dazed, as flames pour out of the
          kitchen doorway.  Thaddeus pulls away from him, takes in
          the flames, then runs toward them, disappearing into the
          smoke that is already engulfing the house.

          Still dazed, Johnny clambers to his feet -- just as Bruce
          rushes in, helps him up.

                                        BRUCE
                        Thaddeus?!

          Johnny looks into the smoke, then rushes into it, Bruce
          following.



          Thaddeus is wrestling with his boxes of comics, trying to
          save them as smoke pours into the room.  Johnny grabs
          him, causing the boy to scream again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Leave them!  We gotta get out!

          But the boy holds onto the boxes for dear life.  Bruce
          grabs them.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - THREE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 45.


    89CONTINUED:89

                                        BRUCE
                        It's okay, I got 'em!

          With Johnny holding onto the screaming Thaddeus, and Bruce
          holding the boxes, they rush out of the room.



            A bedroom door cracks open and we see Callie trying to
          separate the fighting twins while a TV blares.  A POLICE
          WOMAN has been dragooned into helping.  The door closes,
          then our POV crosses to a window, pulling aside shades to
          look out to a balcony.



            Stanton's CELL PHONE rings at his desk.  A distinctive
          ring tone but not the ring.  As he picks it up, brings it
          to his ear...

                                        STANTON
                        Hey baby.

          And we MATCH, MOVE, MORPH off the phone to:          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - FOUR - 3/8/05 - GREEN 54.



          Rings on a window sill.  Different ring tone but still
          not the one.  Stanton, manning a camera pointed out the
          window, answers. 

                                        STANTON
                        I told you not to call me on this
                        line.

          This time we FLASH TO:



          Not the cell, a larger space.  Johnny and Bruce stand
          outside the doorway with Dobbs.  Through a window, we can
          see Ryan Fallon, in his prison jump suit, talking to Callie
          while Thaddeus draws at a card table.

                                        DOBBS
                        Kujo wasn't so squeaky clean after
                        all.  Stanton's testimony led us
                        to a stash in the burbs.  Enough
                        stuff there to put Boris away for
                        a long time.

                                        BRUCE
                        Ryan?

                                        DOBBS
                          Governor granted his stay.  He
                        won't get out right away, but
                        he'll get out.
                                (beat)
                        Now if I can just keep the word
                          "psychic" out of my paperwork, I
                        may keep my job.

          He starts to walk away, then turns back.

                        Baiting that confession out of
                        Stanton was pretty gutsy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The real gutsy guy is in there.

          Johnny indicates Thaddeus.

          Dobbs nods and exits.  Johnny and Bruce step into the
          room just as Ryan takes a seat across from the boy.

                                        RYAN
                        Hey Thad.  How you doin', kid?

          Thaddeus keeps drawing, his eyes on his pad, seemingly
          oblivious.  Ryan takes a breath.

                                        RYAN
                        It's okay.  I'm the one who needs
                        to talk.  I'm sorry I never gave
                        you enough credit, didn't see
                        what a really terrific kid you
                        were.  My son.
                                (beat)
                        I won't make that mistake again.
                                (beat)
                        Thad.  I love you.  I truly do.

          Johnny and Bruce share a look, and Ryan lowers his head. 
          But he also knows now that connecting with a child like
          Thaddeus will require patience and time.  So what happens
          next is a shocker.

          The boy reaches out, tentatively and takes his father's
          hand.  Ryan looks up, sees that Thaddeus is pushing
            something across the table toward him with his other hand. 
          His gold shield.

          Ryan reacts, powerfully moved.  As are Johnny and Bruce. 
          Callie and the other kids just watch in stunned silence.

          Ryan puts his fingers on the other side of the badge,

          pushes it gently back toward Thaddeus.

                                        RYAN
                        You keep it.  You deserve it more
                        than I do.

          ON JOHNNY, reacting to this potent father-son moment. 
          And we sense his pain at something long missing from his
          own life.  So does Bruce.  He puts a hand on Johnny's
            shoulder.  Time to go.  But as they start to exit...

                                        RYAN
                        Mister Smith?  Mister Lewis?

          Johnny and Bruce turn to see Ryan standing by the table.

                                        RYAN
                        Thank you.

          But then another small miracle.  Thaddeus gets out of his
          chair, eyes downcast, and takes a few tentative steps
          toward Johnny.  And then he looks up, rushes the rest of
          the way, and wraps his arms around Johnny's waist.

          Both Johnny and Bruce are rocked.  Johnny gently puts a
          hand on the boys head, ruffles his hair.  Off the moment...



          On a pensive Johnny, Bruce glancing over as he drives.

                        But no story truly has an end.*

          We hear the SOUND of a galloping horse.


  112112A DRAWING - CU ON A WHITE HORSE'S HOOVES

          As it gallops across a meadow.  TILT UP to reveal a tall
          rider, who looks very much like Ryan Fallon, with Young
          Finn held in front of him.

          we found it.
