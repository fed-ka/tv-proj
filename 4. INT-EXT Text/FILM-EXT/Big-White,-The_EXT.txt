A police car, nothing more than a speck on the landscape, is intermittently
visible through the blowing snow.
The police car pulls to a stop, just as the woman does a pirouette and falls
over backwards.
Detective Boyle and the other Cop get out and walk over.

Dispatch, this is unit 611, we need a first

The lid reopens. Night time now, as a street lamp BUZZES to life. A middle
aged MAN in work clothes checks to make sure he's alone. He gently lowers
the lid, opens it again a moment later, this time balancing a mini-bar fridge on
his shoulder.
He dumps the appliance into the bin and runs off.

The dumpster reopens. Morning now. A Korean-American
TEENAGER
wearing an apron and headphones sings along to an
old KISS tune as he
deposits two large orange garbage bags.
TEENAGER
"...Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet, get
down, everybody's gonna leave their seat...gonna

He shuts the lid with care.

A cookie-cutter subdivision.
Old pine trees poke through the snow cover that
blankets the neighborhood.
HOWARD (30s), a burly outdoors type, is trying to
unload a new snowmobile from the back of his pickup.
TED WATTERS (late
20s) half hidden under a heavy dress coat, walks down the street. He stops by
Howard's driveway.
TED
Need a hand?
HOWARD
(turning)
Yeah.
Could ya grab me those two by eights?
Ted walks up the driveway, grabs the wood slats, makes a ramp by leaning
them against the rear bumper.
HOWARD (cont'd)
Thanks.
Howard maneuvers the snowmobile down the ramp, his back turned toward
Ted -- who has taken out a small cam-corder and is taping Howard.
HOWARD (cont'd)
I tell ya, it may look fast but it sure ain't light.
You the
guy who just moved in to the Stevens old house?
TED
No.
Name's Ted.
HOWARD
Hey Ted, I'm Howard.
TED
Hey Howard.
What is that, an Arctic Cat? What do
those go for?

Howard finally has the snowmobile on the ground.
He's breathing heavy as he
pulls off his mitt to shake hands.
HOWARD
More than I could normally afford, I'll tell ya.
(seeing the camera)
Hey!
What do you think you're you doing?
As Ted and Howard continue to talk, we PULL BACK to reveal we are watching
Ted's video playing on a VCR that is --

STRIP MALL - NIGHT
11
The city skyline rises in the distance as heat vents belch steam against the
rapidly setting sun.
But that's miles away.
Here on the outskirts is a rapidly
failing five store strip mall; a "Porn-a-copia" XXX Video store, hair stylist,
small engine repair shop, fish and chips joint and the "Barnell Great Escapes"
travel agency.
We might notice a big trash dumpster in the corner.
Paul's car,
a Ford Taurus, pulls onto the parking pad.

Paul, still on the phone, carries the papers to the dumpster.
PAUL
Yes, and that check went out a week ago.
I watched
my secretary write it up.

Black.
Paul opens the lid.
The phone is cradled in his neck, he checks each
soggy page to make sure he's not tossing anything important.
PAUL
Well I don't know.
I, I, I have no clue.
Could it
possibly be a problem on your end?
So the electric
company never makes a...
Look, I pay my bills.
I'm a
Rotarian for goodness --
Paul looks over to see some MEN from Rodney's Repo Ranch walking up to
the front door of his office.
Distracted for a moment, the phone slips and falls
into the trash.
Paul, muttering, leans in to get it.
He pushes aside an orange garbage bag,
guided by the faint sound of the other person STILL TALKING. And then--
PAUL'S POV: of THE BODY-- a 40-ish White (well, a little blue) male dressed in
a cheap suit.
Paul's phone lies across the corpse's mouth, like the dead guy is
talking.
THE CELL PHONE
Mr. Barnell?
Mr. Barnell?

A SHOUT as Paul jumps back from the dumpster. The lid CRASHES down as
he scrambles/slides away.
He takes a moment to compose himself, then
realizes his phone is still in there.
He opens the dumpster lid and very quickly reaches in, grabs his cell and
hurries off.
The lid CRASHES shut.
PAUL
(into the phone)
Hello?
Hung up.
Paul dials 911, looks back at the dumpster, thinks for a second, then
hits END.
He stands there, thinking.

Paul backs his Ford Taurus up to the dumpster, pops the trunk, checks to
make sure he's alone then steps up on the rear bumper, opens the lid and
clambers inside.

Ted drives home through a wooded section of town.

Ted car slides toward a moose that has wandered into the middle of the road.
The car stops about five feet away.
The moose looks at Ted.
Ted looks back, wondering what he ever did to
deserve the life he's stuck with.
After a moment, the moose lumbers off.
Ted
drives on.

INT TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
C18
TIGHT ON: A COMPUTER SCREEN where swirling signs of the Zodiac act as a
screen saver.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are --
A telephone cord runs from the computer to the headset of TIFFANY (20s), pert,
smart and dressed in a tight University of Alaska T-shirt.
Tiffany sits with her
feet up on the desk as she flips through a copy of "Cosmo".
It's a medium sized apartment, littered with guy stuff although bowing to
advancing signs of feminine influence.
The phone RINGS.
Tiffany hits the space bar.
The caller's number flashes on
screen.
By the second ring, an electronic timer kicks in and a complete file on
the caller appears with name, address, background, pets...
She smiles, hits
"enter."
TIFFANY
(into her headset)
Psychic Pals.
How are you today... Mr. Williams?
(pause - she listens)
Well, we are all registered psychics here.
I just had
a feeling you'd be calling.
What's up?
A KEY IN THE DOOR.
A tired Ted walks inside.
TED
Hey Tiff.
Tiffany looks up, then holds up a file folder with the words "WORKING -
SHHHHHH!" in big black letters.
TIFFANY
(to caller)
Your TV remote control?
Okay.
Ted SIGHS, gives her a quick peck on the cheek as he wrestles off his winter
gear and heads to the kitchen.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
I need you to clear your mind...
Ted looks into the fridge, making up new words to the song "Escape."
TED
"If you like frozen enchiladas, getting caught in the
rain.
If you're not into...something brownish."
Ted pulls out some Tupperware, tries to figure out what's in it.
Tiffany, still
wearing her headset, appears behind him, grabs a Diet Coke from the fridge
and kisses him on the cheek.
TIFFANY
It's stew.
I'm not sure it's still good.
TED
Aren't you with a customer?
TIFFANY
They're concentrating.
Ted grabs a fork, takes the pot and sits at the table.
Tiffany goes back to her
desk and flips through her magazine.
TED
(through a mouthful of food)
So?
How's the tea leaf business today?
TIFFANY
I've decided from now on to ignore you when you're
ignorant about my work.
And it's going very well
thank you.
(reconnecting to the caller)
Mr. Williams, I'm seeing sofa cushions.
Do you have
a sofa?
Good.
Glad I could help.
TED
You here from that software distributor guy?
TIFFANY
No, but I did crack that code problem.
You know how
sometimes when you're running Beta versions you --
TED
English, please.
TIFFANY
There was a boo-boo, but I fixed it.
(another call comes in)
Psychic Pals, how are you today, Carol?
Now I
thought we'd agreed God is everywhere, but not
specifically in your coffee pot.
TED
Jeez, Tiff.
TIFFANY
Jeez, Ted.
Do I tell you how to do your job?
TED
(kidding... kind of)
No, but then again I'm not a computer aided pseudo
psychic, so if you're looking for moral equivalence...
TIFFANY
Before you say anything else that may keep us from
having sex ever again, let me ask you something...
She picks up her magazine.
TED
Tiff, please.
I always get these wrong.
TIFFANY
That's why we keep trying.
Now, Love is Sacrifice
test.
(reading)
If you were in a life raft with me and there was only
enough water --
TED
Don't you have a customer?
TIFFANY
(to the caller)
Carol?
God says he's busy with a famine right now,
but you should keep praying.
Cool.
She hangs up.
Turns back to Ted, about to pick up where she left off...
TED
No.
I'm not doing it.
TIFFANY
It's just a stupid quiz.
TED
Exactly.
The PHONE RINGS.
Tiffany bolts to her desk, sits, spins in her chair as she
answers the call.
TIFFANY
Psychic Pals.
Is this the first time you've called us
Mrs...?
Tiffany at her computer, enters the name "Margaret Barnell" into her database.
Tiffany works a "mute" button as she points back to the magazine.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
But stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential
relationship problems.
(to her caller)
Margaret, I'm getting the feeling this is an anxious
day for you.
Ted, cooking pot in hand, walks over to her desk.
TED
Our only relationship problem is you're running a
$1.99 a minute carny scam out of my living room.
TIFFANY
Don't call it a scam.
(to the caller - startled)
Excuse me?
TED
What?
TIFFANY
You've got to learn to channel that rage, Margaret.
(to Ted - playful)
You didn't just call this your living room, did you?
TED
I meant ours.
Ours, ours, ours.
Tiffany returns to her call, but keeps looking at Ted.
TIFFANY
I feel someone you really care about, maybe even
the love of your life, is being a real pain.
Now I need
you to concentrate...
Ted pretends to do just that, drawing a giggle from Tiffany before he walks off.

The lid opens.
GARY and JIMBO (30s), check to insure they're not being
watched.
Gary, slightly effeminate, leans into the bin and BURROWS through
the garbage.
Jimbo, a bear of man, keeps watch.
He's nervous, a little out of
sorts.
GARY
I thought stuff didn't smell when it was frozen?
I
don't know why we have to--
JIMBO
Dave wants visual confirmation, he gets visual
confirmation.
We have a chance to move up here,
so let's just--
GARY
Like the guy's not gonna end up in a land- fill,
anyway.
You ever ask Dave what he did?
JIMBO
Whatever it was, he told him if he did it again, he'd
snap his neck.
GARY
(smiling)
Whoops, he did it again.
(off Jimbo not getting it)
The song?
From that girl?
No response.
Gary, HUMMING now, keeps digging, finding nothing.
GARY (cont'd)
So how'd it feel?
I mean, not when you did it, but,
like now?
JIMBO
I don't want to talk about it.
Gary hops inside as his actions become more frantic.
Still no luck.
He stands.
GARY
Not here.
Jimbo glares at his partner.
GARY (cont'd)
Serious.
He's gone.
Maybe he wasn't...
JIMBO
Don't even joke.
Maybe the trash was emptied.
GARY
Looks pretty full.
Hey...
(ducking down)
There's a little fridge down here.
(standing)
If we would have shot him at least we'd know for
sure.
JIMBO
I was following orders.
And if you hadn't started a
screaming match, no one would have called the
cops and we wouldn't have had to dump his --
GARY
Fine.
Sorry.
JIMBO
Fine.
GARY
I'm just saying... maybe you didn't break it all the way.
JIMBO
(walking away)
It was broken.
GARY
I'm just saying... maybe it was like hypothermia and
he just looked dead.
JIMBO
It - was - BROKEN!
Gary, embarrassed, digs in the trash with his feet.

LAUGHING children on toboggans, inner tubes and discarded cardboard
boxes slide down a snow covered hill against a slate gray sky.
It's an isolated
area on the outskirts of the city.
30
31
About 50 yards away from the two cars, Gary's NEPHEW is having his
Snowrider (a tricycle with skis instead of wheels) hijacked by a playground
BULLY in a red parka.
A tug o' war for the toy ensues as Gary and Jimbo get
out of their car.
NEPHEW
Leggo... it's mine.
Uncle Gary!
32

Gary and Jimbo are leaning close to the Cadillac's open window. Dave does
not look happy.
DAVE
(to Jimbo)
Wait a minute.
He's disappeared?
Gary waves to his nephew.
GARY
(shouting)
You just... hang in there, Billy!
JIMBO
Yeah.
But he's dead.
I mean, that part, no question.
DAVE
Yeah?
Take off your coat.
And your shirt, too.
Jimbo knows better than to argue.
He strips down, exposing his corpulent
middle-aged belly to the chilly winter winds.
JIMBO
I'm not wearing a wire, Dave, if that's what this is
about.
GARY
It was our first time.
No one gets it perfect their first
time.
DAVE
You too, Sweetie.
Gary is about to comply when the sound of a FIGHT on the tobogganing hill
causes them all to look over, just in time to see GARY'S NEPHEW shoved to
ground.
The Bully LAUGHS as he slides away.
GARY
Excuse me for a second.
Gary trots toward the hill.
Jimbo can't believe it.
JIMBO
Gary!
We're in the middle of something.
GARY
(calling back)
Hey, I'm supposed to be looking after him.
Jimbo turns back to Dave, shrugging sheepishly.
DAVE
Is he...?
JIMBO
He's fine.
Look, we can take you there right now.
We'll show you.
Behind them on the hill, Gary tries to retrieve his nephew's Snowrider from the
Bully.
He is failing.
DAVE
Show me what?
An empty trash dumpster?
It was
supposed to look like an accident.
I was hoping to
see it in the paper.
So help me, if this guy pops up
somewhere...
While Jimbo does his best to stay warm, behind him on the hill, Gary can only
watch as the Bully slides away.
BULLY
(echoing in the cold)
Fag!
Big homo!
JIMBO
He won't.
He can't.
He's --
DAVE
Proof, Jimbo.
I like to know my money's well spent.
You got a week.
Dave drives off as Gary walks over with his SNIFFLING nephew.
GARY
Slippery little sucker.
You mind if we stop at a toy
store on the way back?

BARNELL HOME - MORNING

A newspaper clears the "For Sale - price reduced!" sign on the front lawn and
lands with a THUD on the steps.

A ways out in the forest.
Only two houses on this turn-out; a cozy looking lived
in cabin sits up the road from a seemingly deserted rundown mobile home.
A
car pulls up.
A40
41
Paul undoes the bungee cord and drags his snowblower out of the trunk.
He
fires up the snowblower and starts to plow the drive way of both houses.
MRS. WHERRY (80s), in her bathrobe, looks out the window of the cozy cabin.
A tad confused, she waves to the man in the blue parka.
The blue parka waves
back.
42
47
A "Moose Xing" sign is briefly illuminated by Paul's car's headlights as it heads
up a snow packed mountain road.
The distant lights of the city are swallowed
by the thick forests of fir trees that line the road.
48
A48
Paul pulls off.
Kills his headlights.
Pops the trunk.

The corpse, now in Raymond's clothing and the blue parka, lies face up on the
Aloha Airlines promotional surfboard being lurched forward by Paul, who wears
a pair of snowshoes.
On the body's chest lies a second pair of snowshoes.
Somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS.
50

Paul at the top of a 25 foot drop.
He rolls the corpse, now wearing the other set
of snowshoes, over the side.
It BOUNCES down, landing in the snow with a
soft WHUMPH!

Paul, wearing snowshoes and carrying the surfboard, peeks over the edge.
PAUL'S POV: down at the corpse, exactly as it was last night.
PAUL
Well come on!
How much easier do I have to make
this?
His words echo in the cold wilderness.
54
- LATE AFTERNOON

A large sign outside advertises "Fresh Moose Meat". Paul runs out with a
shopping bag, jumps in his car and drives off.
56

Paul, carrying the shopping bag, he painfully picks his way down the rock face
toward the corpse.
PAUL

You may want to take a gander.
You may want to

THE BACON HAT -- as Paul pulls it snug on the corpse's head.
He pulls the
bloody steaks from the shopping bag and starts to smear them on the corpse's
parka.
Drops of blood hit the snow at the body's feet and disappear.
Paul drapes the steaks on the body, tucking one under an arm, the other
hanging from a pocket. He pauses for moment, then pulls out a container of
lard and, fighting his own revulsion, smears it across the dead man's face.
PAUL
Sorry about this part.
Paul pats the body on the shoulder, then looks up at the ridge and the long
journey ahead.

A WOLF appears in the moonlight.
Followed by another, and another.
They
approach the corpse...
59

Snowmobiles SCREAM to the site as people tramp through the thick snow,
covering all of Paul's hard work.
An ambulance and State Conservation
vehicles pack the area where Paul first pulled off.
Yellow police tape is strung
between fir trees marking a path toward the ridge.
60
- DAY

The corpse is covered with a tarp.
The area is littered with blood, animal tracks
and bits of blue parka.
POLICE OFFICERS and tough looking LOCAL
SNOWMOBILERS mill about the corpse, taking turns lifting the tarp that covers
the body.
A few yards away, DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s) talks to a seemingly
distraught Paul.
DETECTIVE BOYLE
(looking at the ridge)
If it's any comfort to you, he likely wasn't eaten while
conscious.
Did he say where he'd been living,
before he came home?
PAUL
Florida.
He didn't really talk about it much.
He
brought us this shell.
Paul holds up a sea shell, obviously from the display at his office.
Tears well
up in his eyes.
PAUL (cont'd)
It's really all we have left.
He'd been gone for five
years.
We'd given him up--
DETECTIVE BOYLE
--for dead, yes sir.
PAUL
How did you...?
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Anonymous phone tip from some Jamaican guy.
(Paul shows no reaction)
Said he saw what looked like a body.
We tracked
you through his ID.
PAUL
Just like on TV.
Boyle nods sympathetically
PAUL (cont'd)
I've got to see him.
Please.
Paul starts to make his way to the body.
Boyle stops him.
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Mr. Barnell,
I should warn you, an animal
attack isn't
pretty.
There's not much left.
Paul nods.
They make their way over to the tarp.
Boyle pulls it back.
DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)
Is that your brother, sir?
Paul leans in-- the man's face is hamburger.
Paul nods.
PAUL
They chewed his ears off.
What kind of animal does
something like that?
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Normally I'd say bear, but these tracks and the
feeding pattern indicate wolf.
It's rare, but it can
happen.
Boyle pulls the cover back over the body. Boyle hands Barnell a clear baggie
with the dead man's wallet inside.
DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)
Your brother's personal effects.
We've got some
people with the victim's assistance program who
can help you through this.
Marcie?
Marcie, a female police officer, walks a distraught Paul away.
As they go,
another FEMALE COP approaches.
FEMALE COP
Coroner found some smaller bite marks on the
ankle.
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Pups.
Must have been the whole freakin' pack.
FEMALE COP
You want an autopsy?
DETECTIVE BOYLE
On what?
FEMALE COP
Derek found this.
She holds up a clear evidence bag with the remnants of a strip of bacon on the
inside.
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Not the smartest snack for a hiker.
FEMALE COP
Messy animals aren't they?
DETECTIVE BOYLE
Messy.
Messy messy messy messy.

TV NEWS CAMERA POV: Of Paul, standing on his stoop, as he's interviewed by
a well made-up female TV REPORTER (20s) dressed for the cold.
TV REPORTER
You ready Mr. Barnell?
PAUL
Yes.
The camera man flicks on his light as Paul squints.
TV REPORTER
The police told us what happened, how are you folks
holding up?
MARGARET (O.S.)
Paul?
Who's out there?
Paul reaches back, and, as discretely as possible, grabs the door handle to
keep Margaret from opening it.
PAUL
Obviously, my wife's very upset...
MARGARET (O.S.)
Paul, the door's stuck!
Margaret starts to HAMMER rhythmically on the door.
PAUL
(ignoring her)
It's been a tough, you know, when something like
this happens you just have to ask yourself...
MARGARET (O.S.)
Who fucked with the fucking door!
PAUL
You can see how stressful it's been, I should really
go now.
We have to plan a service.
And with that, Paul opens his front door and ducks inside, quickly shutting it
behind him.

Gary and Jimbo's car parked in the lot.
Gary is just returning to the vehicle with
a brown paper bag.
Jimbo has the look of man who hasn't slept in days.
Gary and Jimbo are eating fish and chips.
The name on the bag is "Ye' Olde
Fish Shoppe."
JIMBO
Cod or Halibut?
GARY
Didn't ask.
JIMBO
(digging in)
So we got six different stores here. We got your
"Great Escapes" travel agency, your Ye Old Fish and
Chips place, Porn-a-Copia videos, a hair place, one
for lease and one... what is that?
GARY
Small engine repair.
See all the snow blowers out
front.
There is indeed a row of snowblowers lined up outside.
Jimbo takes another
bite of his fish.
GARY (cont'd)
Should move the blowers over to the triple X store.
Gary LAUGHS.
Jimbo is in no mood.
JIMBO
So, which one you figure would want to take our
friend?
GARY
I guess maybe the porn palace.
Ya know for some
weird sex film.
JIMBO
Yeah, this place is just a hotbed of adult cinema
production.
Fish shop look clean?
GARY
Very nice Korean family.
You figure maybe they
battered him up?
Gary LAUGHS again, then shoves Jimbo's shoulder.
GARY (cont'd)
Maybe we're eatin' him right now.
Huh?
JIMBO
Gary, this isn't a joke.
You ever known Dave to joke?
Gary, embarrassed, takes another bite of his fish.
Jimbo turns up the radio.
A
local call-in show comes on.
WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
...it could never happen.
There's never been a
documented case--
GARY
Sorry.
JIMBO
Yeah, "Sorry."
I get strip searched and you go off
playing snow angels...
RADIO HOST (O.S.)
Well, we've got one now, don't we!?
WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
That was different. From what I read in the paper he
was unconscious. And now people are going to use
this as an excuse to--
RADIO HOST (O.S.)
Hey lady, why don't you tell Raymond Barnell how
wolves have gotten a bad rap.
WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
I can tell you from years of experience that wolves do
not operate--
JIMBO
Wait a minute.
RADIO HOST (O.S.)
You can tell me all you want, lady, but it is an
undeniable, indisputable fact.
This Barnell guy got
turned into a Scooby Snack by a pack of wild
animals...
JIM'S POV: Through the windshield, looking at the sign for "Barnell Great
Escapes Travel."
Jimbo and Gary look at each other. Maybe...

Tombstones, barely visible through the blowing snow, dot the top of a small hill
on the outskirts of town.
A small group of mourners try to keep warm.
Paul and
Margaret, Avis, two other FRIENDS and the MINISTER huddle against the cold.
MINISTER
When someone is taken from us at such a young
age we often ask ourselves, why?
What possible
purpose could this serve?
The Minister is temporarily lost from view.
MINISTER (cont'd)
(just a voice in the white)
Why is God, who is a loving God, capable of such
things...
The snow clears.
Paul, a pillar of strength, discreetly checks his watch then
sneaks a concerned look at Margaret who busily grins at everyone in sight.
Ted's car pulls into the parking area.
75
76
A wind GUST rocks the casket just as it's lowered into the frozen earth.
The
funeral breaks up quickly as Paul and his wife shake hands with the minister.
PAUL
That was lovely, thank you so much.
MINISTER
Margaret, Paul, you two get some sleep.
Paul looks nervously at Margaret, who is about to reply.
As her mouth
engages, a gust of wind obliterates most of her words, except for...
MARGARET
...nun banger.
The Minister smiles, he must have misunderstood.
MINISTER
Absolutely.
Paul turns to see Ted approaching.
A blast of snow obscures his view.
When
Ted reappears, he's just a few steps away.
TED
Mr. Barnell.
There was no hurry on this, we could
wait until--
PAUL
It's OK.
We just wrapped up.
This is my wife,
Margaret.
As they shake hands, and Margaret opens her mouth to speak...
PAUL (cont'd)
Why don't you wait in the car, sweetheart?
MARGARET
Okee dokee, smokee.
Margaret smiles and totters off.
PAUL
She's under a little strain right now.
Ted looks down the hill at a small group of TV news vans, the REPORTERS
just now venturing out into the cold.
TED
I see the media's here.
They don't give people a
moment's peace, do they?
PAUL
I called them.
TED
(surprised)
Really?
PAUL
Well, they've been asking me to talk some more
about Raymond.
I thought now might be an
appropriate time.
TED
And you'll just happen to mention your heartless
insurance company that hasn't paid off your policy
yet.
PAUL
I had to borrow money for the casket, Mr. Ted.
TED
You are breaking my heart.
PAUL
No, I doubt that.
They asked me to bring some
photos of Raymond.
Guess it's gonna be a pretty
big story.
He pulls out some shots of his brother.
They whip around in the wind and
blowing snow.
PAUL (cont'd)
Of course, we could walk over there together.
You
could tell them how deeply moved you were by this
tragedy and how... the check is on its way?
Ted thinks, grudgingly impressed with Paul's ploy.
TED
Enjoy your press conference, Mr. Barnell.
Paul stuffs the photos back in his pocket and walks down the hill.
Ted watches
him go, is about to leave when a gust of wind forces him to avert his eyes.
Looking down he sees a photo of Raymond Barnell, on the beach in swim
trunks.
Must have fallen.
Ted pockets it and moves on.

Paul pulls up, hits the garage door opener and drives in.

Paul gets out of his car carrying a K-Mart bag.
He looks like he's been
CRYING.
Mrs. Wherry waves from her deck.
MRS. WHERRY
Paul, sorry to hear about your brother.
(Paul gives a sad smile)
You moving in?
PAUL
Just for a bit.
MRS. WHERRY
She'll come to her senses.
They always do.
Oh, the
septic lines are frozen, so you'll have to use the
outdoor commode.
Paul waves as he enters the mobile home, closing the door behind him.
A
light goes on.
It starts to snow.

TIGHT ON: Car tires as they pull to a stop on the main road.
A pair of heavy
men's boots get out, start to make their way toward the mobile home.

Paul, looking like a man who recently took a beating, shovels the light snow
cover that blankets the drive.
He looks as Ted's car pulls up.
As Ted walks
toward him...
PAUL
Mr. Watters.
You said on the phone something
about a resolution in our claim?
TED
Mr. Barnell.
Why are you staying out here?
Paul thinks about this for a long time.
Then, finally...
PAUL
My wife and I, we're having some problems.
TED
Kind of understandable I guess.
Seeing as how you
killed that man and dumped his body out in the
woods.
PAUL
You mean Raymond?
TED
No.
Not Raymond.
Definitely not Raymond.
I
thought it was at first, but that's what was throwing
me...
PAUL
I'm not sure I appreciate your tone.
TED
My tone, Mr. Barnell?
You are going to jail.
I will
personally see to that.
PAUL
I really think you should go now.
TED
You are a liar and thief.
Paul stabs his shovel into a snow bank, then walks to Ted.
PAUL
You know Mr. Watters, I've had a pretty rough night,
so if you wouldn't mind just leaving.
Paul tries to guide Ted away, but slips and falls on the snow.
Ted, rolling his
eyes, reaches down to help him up.
TED
(noticing the bruises)
Hey.
How'd you get all cut up?
MRS. WHERRY (O.S.)
What's say you just move away from him.
Ted, with his hands still on Paul, turns to see -- Mrs. Wherry, from her porch, a
compound bow aimed at his forehead.
MRS. WHERRY (cont'd)
You all right there, Paul?
PAUL
I'm fine, Mrs. Wherry.
Just go back inside.
MRS. WHERRY
I can drop him if you want.
PAUL
I'm fine.
Really.
(turning to Watters)
I think you'd better go.
Ted backs to his car, gets in and drives off.
Paul brushes the snow from his
jacket, reaches up, touches his bleeding forehead (the fall having reopened the
wound).
MRS. WHERRY
I've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that.
Paul waves her off, then stares at the blood on his fingertips.
An idea slowly
takes hold.

The sky moves from dark grey to light grey, then stops.
A thermometer outside
on an office tower shows a brisk minus 20.
Workers bundle themselves
against the cold, hurry to work past the drifts piled alongside the road.

Paul, seen through the window, sits alone in the dark.
His face lit only by a
small flashlight, he is completely still.

A large back hoe TURNS OVER.
The muffler BELCHES a cloud of black
smoke into the air.
Arnith is at the controls, expertly maneuvering the shovel
end towards the unmarked grave.

Ted exits, a BLAST of Arctic wind and snow hits him in the face.
He closes his
eyes, letting the cold run over him.
122
PAUL'S HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT
123
Ted pulls up in front of Paul's home.
He stares at something that looks like a
tree on the front lawn.
He looks closer -- it's a "For Sale" sign.
TED
Blowing town, are we, Mr. Barnell?
I don't think so.
Ted staggers through the snow to the sign and drunkenly pushes it down into
the snow.
TED (cont'd)
I'm not done yet "travel man!"
You hear me?!
LAUGHING, he takes some matches from his pocket and tries to light the "For
Sale" sign on fire.
It's no use.
He quits.
He's cold now.
He gets up and
staggers back to his car.

A beautiful winter's night, the soft snowy silence broken only by Raymond's
drunken shot of...

Pussy!!!
A startled rabbit scurries across the snow.

Ted and Tiffany walk out to their car.
They sneak looks at each other, not
entirely sure what emotional sign-post they just passed.

The residence seen from a distance.
RAYMOND (O.S.)
That little prick!!!
As the camera rushes the mobile home, from inside comes the sounds of a
very angry man.
Then, just as we're at the door, it SLAMS OPEN.
Raymond
stands in the doorway, a mountain of anger in a hastily pulled on parka.
He's holding the clock radio by the cord.
He checks his wristwatch, then
smashes the clock radio against the trailer.
Stalking toward his car, he checks the pistol in his side pocket, then, almost as
an afterthought, opens the clip.
No bullets.
He smiles.

A not-well-frequented tourist spot, featuring an expansive, far-as-the-eye-can
see carpet of white.
The road from the turnoff is about 200 yards long, leading
to a plowed out parking area.
The road is the only way in or out.
Paul's car
takes the corner and heads toward the parking area.

Gary and Jimbo's car pulls in, sliding to a stop beside Paul.

Ted's car pulls up at the far end of the lot, about 200 yards from where Paul,
Gary and Jimbo are parked.
Paul's car is in between Ted's car and Jimbo's.
Paul gets out of his car, as do Jimbo and Gary.
Paul looks for Margaret in the
back of Jimbo's car, but she remains lying down on the backseat.
JIMBO
Mr. Barnell.
I'll assume you've got our friend back
there?
PAUL
Yes.
You can let her go now.
153
156
Ted rushes up beside Raymond.
TED
Excuse me.
Aren't you... Raymond Barnell?
RAYMOND
I know you?
TED
(confused)
You're... You're dead?
Raymond shoots him a look... Clearly this was taken as a threat.
Ted can't
help but step back.
TED (cont'd)
That came out so wrong.
Raymond sizes up Ted, then looks off to Paul's car.
RAYMOND
Go away, now.
Raymond walks on.
Ted, realizing he has no choice, runs and jumps in front of
Raymond, blocking his way.
TED
Okay, I don't know exactly what's going on here, but if
you would come with me to my office, just for a few
minutes, it would really help me out with my boss.
Raymond steps around Ted.
Ted stays with him.
TED (cont'd)
Look, I'm not trying to screw with your life at all, but
you can't just walk off with a million dollars and
expect people to--
RAYMOND
(stops cold)
How much?
TED
See, your brother has, and I use this term carefully,
stolen a million dollars from my insurance company.
Now if we--
Before he can finish, Raymond hits him with an elbow to the temple.
Ted
drops to his knees, but even as Raymond tries to walk off, Ted manages to
grab his ankle.

At Jimbo's car, Gary is folding the corpse into the trunk as Jimbo pulls Margaret
upright from the backseat and tugs down her gag.
She smiles at him as, with
great care, he helps her out of the car and presents her to her husband.
PAUL
It's all over honey.
It's all over.
Did they hurt you?
MARGARET
(smiling/whisper)
Does food poisoning count?
Have you been eating?
PAUL
You know me when I get busy.
She touches the bruise under his eye.
MARGARET
Did you fall?
PAUL
Just a little.
(to Jimbo)
Hey, we're gonna get...
That's when Paul sees what Jimbo and Gary are watching.
Raymond kicks Ted in the head, turns, spots Paul and breaks into a run.
Paul seems frozen, but just for a moment.
JIMBO
Who the hell is that?
MARGARET
Paul?
Paul discretely takes off his red parka and drapes it over Margaret's shoulders.
PAUL
(quietly)
Honey, I need you to start walking to that hill over
there, alright?
MARGARET
Why?
PAUL
I'll catch up in a bit.
Now, no matter what you hear,
just keep going, alright.
And if I'm... late or
something, just look in the coat, alright?
Margaret nods, kisses her husband quickly on the cheek, then starts to walk
off.
Paul, Gary and Jimbo watch, transfixed at the down-parka'd shit-storm that is
headed their way.
GARY
(nervous)
Jimbo?
RAYMOND
(yelling)
A million dollars, Paul!?
You really think you could
take me?
Again!
JIMBO
What million dollars?
Gary and Jimbo look over at Paul, somewhat confused. Raymond's ten yards
out, and they can now see he's taken out his gun.
He's aiming it at Paul.
Paul looks over his shoulder at Margaret, who's having some trouble making it
up a snow covered hill.
Gary's hand slips into his pocket, grabbing hold of his gun.
Raymond,
oblivious, moves right past.
159
160
Raymond reaches Paul, takes the gun and points it at the top of his head.
Paul's eyes shut tight, expecting the worst.
PAUL
Raymond... please.
But shooting your brother is tougher than it looks. Paul opens his eyes.
Raymond tries to pull the trigger again, but can't. He moves the barrel six
inches to the right and shoots Margaret in the back.
She drops face first into
the snow.
Paul's world ends.
Ears RINGING, he rushes toward his wife.
Jimbo can't believe it as Gary holds him back.
JIMBO
Hey!
What the fuck!!
Raymond, a look of relief on his face, turns to Jimbo.
JIMBO (cont'd)
She had nothing to do with this!
RAYMOND
And you do?
But even before Raymond can raise his weapon, Gary pulls his gun and gets it
pointed (shakily) at Raymond.
RAYMOND (cont'd)
Oh put it down, Nancy.
GARY
You first.
JIMBO
Gary!
Just --
Raymond drops his gun to his side.
Gary smiles, too happy he won the face
off.
RAYMOND
You win, tough guy.
Gary, trying to be cool, flips the gun to his other hand.
As he does-- BANG!
The
bullet rips into the snow about six feet from Raymond's feet.
Raymond glares at Gary.
So does Jimbo.
GARY
(meek, apologetic)
Sorry.
Jimbo lunges for cover as Raymond FIRES back.
Gary, truly terrified, closes
his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run -- BANGBANGBANGBANG.
One bullet bounces off Paul's car.
One hits Raymond.
With a quizzical look on
his face, he drops to his knees.
A large crimson stain forms on his jacket.
Everything goes quiet, except for the sounds coming from...
Paul, almost crazed with grief, cradles his wife's body.
PAUL
Oh God... Oh Jesus...
MARGARET
(muffled)
Oh fucking hell... I can't... breath.
Paul gently turns her over.
Margaret, alive, unharmed but winded, tries to catch
her breath.
MARGARET (cont'd)
Paul...
Someone kicked me.
Paul feels around the bullet hole and pulls out a stack of money, now
embedded with the slug from the Raymond's gun.
He starts to weep tears of
relief.
PAUL
Can you stand.
MARGARET
Is... The Pope... a...
PAUL
Okay, easy...
Gary is behind the other car with Jimbo.
GARY
(starting to lose it)
He just, fell... Oh Jesus, oh God.
Jimbo gently takes Gary's gun.
JIMBO
I know.
As Jimbo puts an arm around Gary and helps him to the car, he sees Paul,
arm around Margaret, coming their way.
Everyone stops.
A look passes, then
both couples move off.
161
161
As Jimbo and Gary drive away, Paul brings Margaret to his vehicle.
Spotting
Raymond, he walks over, kicks the gun away, then leans down.
Raymond's not
dead, but he's close.
Paul has to turn away.
RAYMOND
(laboured)
Look at me, you little...
Paul turns back, not angry, not frightened, just a little sad.
Raymond, taken
aback for a moment, tries for one last verbal shot, but all he can manage is...
RAYMOND (cont'd)
Puddles.
And Raymond dies.
162

Paul turns back to his car when he spots a delirious, damaged Ted stumbling
toward him with Tiffany desperate to drag him the other way.
TED
Where do think you're going?
TIFFANY
Ted, leave him alone.
TED
No, no, no.
I have been beaten, humiliated, had my
head squeezed by a guy... and I am getting some
answers, right now.
Ted, barely able to stay on his feet (concussion) gets in front of Paul, and just
stands there and waits.
Paul can't help but feel bad for the guy.
PAUL
Okay.
TED
Well go ahead.
(re: his left ear)
I can still kind of hear out of this one.
PAUL
(a long pause)
I love my wife, Mr. Watters.
And when you love
someone, I mean, really love someone...
The punch hits Paul on the top of his head.
He stumbles back, but Ted is on
him before he can move out of range.
It's a strange looking fight between the
younger (physically spent) and older (emotionally drained).
TED
(between punches)
I want a fucking Hallmark card or the lyrics to a
Foreigner rock ballad, I'll go to the mall, Mr. Barnell.
Margaret and Tiffany jump in, trying to pull the two men apart.

Arnith (the grave digger) walks to the side of a casket.
He hits the switch and it
starts to drop.
Arnith watches impassively, taking brief note of two people up
the hill before returning to his work.

It's Gary and Jimbo, dressed in black.
They watch silently as Raymond is laid
to rest.

TROPICAL BEACH - DAY

The sun beats down on a white sand tropical paradise.

Perfection, except for the -- SNOW.
Big pure white flakes,

Tiffany stares at her reflection in the window, her face transported to an island
paradise.
Ted walks out.
TIFFANY
Hey.
TED
Hey yourself.
TIFFANY
So where you want to go?
TED
Somewhere close.
My three o'clock's been moved
up.
TIFFANY
Cool.
You alright about everything?
TED
Yeah.
The life policy was written on his brother, and
he did, you know, die.
I may be rationalizing a bit, but
ethically I think I'm okay.
TIFFANY
Good.
I like it when you're okay.
The two walk down the street.
Snow keeps falling.
Tiffany shuts her eyes,
looks straight up as the gossamer snowflakes land and melt on her face.
She's never looked more beautiful.
TIFFANY (cont'd)
Don't ya just love this weather?
Ted stares at her.
TED
Learning to.
Tiffany grabs his hand and pulls him away, disappearing into the whiteness.
