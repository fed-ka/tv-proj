      A little newborn BABY in a buggy, trundling quietly along in 
    an unidentifiable exterior, where high summer sunlight comes 
      through the trees and flickers across his face. 

    We are in the grounds of a hospital in a busy market town in 
      Yorkshire, but we don t know that yet. And we never see the 
      person pushing the buggy.

    We just stay close on that BABY. He s only a few days old. He 
      looks happy, sleepy and well fed. 

    If such a tiny baby can be said to have a point of view, 
      these first hospital scenes are in his.



    Two boys aged about ten, ROSS and LUKE, are wheelyingabout 
    the station car park on their bikes. 

      A train is visible in the distance, coming towards this semi-
      rural commuter railway station in the North of England.



      There s a problem with a wheel on the buggy. It jumps, and 
      pulls, and stops, near a big building which looms overhead.

    The unidentified CARER struggles for a moment with the buggy, 
    and then gives up.

    The BABY is lifted out in his carrying seat, and the CARER 
      walks away with him, leaving the buggy frame behind.



      A car hurtles into the car park in a tearing hurry.



    The car belongs to driver LAURA  LAURIE  FRANKLIN, aged 36, 
      charging about the crowded car park in search of a place. Her 
      mother JENNIFER  JEN  MASON, 71, is panicking in the 
      passenger seat.

                                    JEN
                    We ll be late.

                                      LAURIE
                              (the hundredth time)
                    We won t be late!

                                    JEN
                    I told you but you never listen.

                                      LAURIE
                    Who are all these bloody people and 
                    why can t they just stay at home?



    The train is pulling in, as LAURIE struggles to get her mum 
    JEN out of the car.

    The boys are still careering about, too close to the car.

                                    JEN
                    I can t go any faster, you ll have 
                    to go without me.

                                      LAURIE
                    Come on, you can do it.
                              (tothe boys)
                    Do you want to watch where you re 
                    going?

                                    ROSS
                    Bugger off, minger!




                                                                                  2                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      Ringleader ROSS leads his pal LUKE away sniggering. They stop 
      a little way off and wait to see if LAURIE will respond - and 
      she d like to, if only she didn t have her hands full of 
      difficult mother.

                                    JEN
                              (close to tears)
                    Go on your own, I don t mind, I 
                    don t want to get in your way.

                                      LAURIE
                    Oh Mum! I m not the one with the 
                    appointment, am I!

                                    JEN
                    There llbe another one along in a 
                    minute.

    The train arrives and one or two doors open. Now that it s 
      clear that they will never make it, and that there is nothing 
      LAURIE can do about any of it, she relaxes.

                                      LAURIE
                    Another what, Mum?

    JEN can t remember the word for train, but she won t admit 
    it. So she changes the subject.

                                    JEN
                    I know what youneed, Laurie my 
                    girl. A nice cup of coffee.

      LAURIE hears the train doors slam. She sighs.

                                      LAURIE
                    What I need is more than twenty 
                    four hours in a day.

    The boys come hurtling by again. This time it s the quieter, 
      more human boy who speaks. 

                                    LUKE
                    You can t park that car here, miss.

                                      LAURIE
                    And you can t ride that bike here, 
                    mister, so that makes us both 
                    villains. 

                                    LUKE
                              (persisting)
                    They have bastard clampers, innit.

                                    JEN
                    I ll clamp youif you re not 
                    careful, potty mouth. 



                                                                                  3                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    ROSS
                    Silly old cow.

      ROSS leads his friend off, giggling and gesticulating. LUKE 
      turns and looks over his shoulder, a bit sorry. LAURIE grins 
    at him, and gets a winning smile back. Connected.

                                    JEN
                              (sour)
                    I blame the parents.

                                      LAURIE
                              (joshing her)
                    So do I.



      LUKE and ROSS ride their bikes past a corner shop, yakking 
      away, just tooling around, without a plan. 

      They turn the corner and ride over a railway bridge.

    The train line stretches away. 




                                                                                  4                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




      Further up the railway line, LAURIE and JEN sit on a bench on 
    the platform, drinking machine coffee out of plastic cups. 

                                    JEN
                            (a bit impatient)
                    Apple, penny, table. Apple penny 
                    table. 

                                      LAURIE
                    OK. Now world backwards.

                                    JEN
                    This coffee s cold.

                                      LAURIE
                    Mum...

                                    JEN
                              (bored)
                    D, L, O, no D, L, R, O, L, D...

    The next train is crawling along towards them. It s a small, 
    two carriage, local commuter service.

      LAURIE stands up and checks her watch anxiously.



    The train flies by.



    We are a couple of miles on from the station, and the train 
    is approaching the road bridge over the track where the two 
      boys were cycling.

    Now LUKE and ROSS scramble up to the top of the embankment on 
      their bikes, with a clear view down towards the bridge and 
    the oncoming train.  

                                    ROSS
                    Wicked!

    He starts heaving at a convenient log.

                                    ROSS (CONT D)
                    Get the other end, man! 

                                    LUKE
                    You re daft, you, it s electric 
                    down there.



                                                                                  7                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      ROSS, always hyper, does a cartoon character being 
      electrocuted.

                                    ROSS
                    Bzzzzbzzzz!It s diesel, you 
                    loser! Take my picture!

      LUKE laughs, and gets his mobile phone out. ROSS, capering 
      about and mugging for the camera.

      A point of view on them from the bridge above the track. 
      Someone is watching. Someone sees LUKE pick up the other end 
    of the log.

    The boys run down the embankment towards the track.



    An impression of something flying past the braking train.

    The screeching brake sound crosses into...



    The wheels of the train screeching to a halt. There is blood 
      smeared on the side front of the train.




                                                                                  9                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




      Halfway down the embankment, the two boys stand open mouthed, 
      looking towards the bridge, still holding on to each end of 
      their log. 

                                    ROSS
                    Gross! I mean really, reallygross. 
                    Like, splat!Ugh! Let s go and see.

      Thrilled to bits, ROSS drops his end of the log and starts to 
      scramble down the hill. LUKE stops him, fearful that the 
      police will soon come.

                                    LUKE
                    Nee nanee na.

                                    ROSS
                    Come on, Luke!

                                    LUKE
                    Come on nothing, if copperscatch 
                    us down there. 

      This time it s ROSS who is reluctant, but he follows his 
      friend back up the hill.



    The boys  log rolls lazily down to the track, and comes to 
      rest by a bloodied trainer shoe.

      Further up the track, the train is coming to rest, with its 
      front end underneath the next bridge.

      LUKE sees everyone s faces peering out of the windows.

    One worried face appears in the window of the back cab of the 
      train: DANNY, the conductor. 


                                                                                10                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      DANNY opens the window and looks up and down the track.

    He sees the lads scrambling to the top of the hill and thinks 
      - vandals.



    The signal turns red.



      DANNY looks down the track. He can t see much.

    He starts to walk away from the train.



      DANNY has reached the log. 

    He gives the log a kick, and reveals the single bloodied 
      trainer. He gets down to look at it, then looks all round 
      carefully, but he can t see anything else.

    He stands up very slowly and looks back along the length of 
    the train towards the tunnel.

      It s very quiet.

      Then he hears a crow cawing. 


                                                                                19                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



    He looks back along the track. The crow has landed on 
      something in the undergrowth.

      DANNY plucks up his courage. And sets off towards it.



      DANNY has left the track and is stumbling through the 
      undergrowth, very upset. We never see quite what he is 
      seeing, and he tries not to look, too, at the fragments of 
    the woman hit at speed by his train. 



      DANNY sees what looks like a large bunch of rags and 
      approaches it cautiously. Claps his hands to drive the crow 
      away.



                                                                                21                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




      DANNY s view of the dead girl: a dark jilbab.Young, female, 
      dead. 

    And Muslim.

      DANNY crouches down beside her and weeps.

    The two of them alone in the landscape.



      DANNY lands on his back at the side of his train. He s not 
      badly hurt, but he is shocked to have been given a shove by a 
      passenger.


                                                                                25                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



    He looks up at the train to see SOHELclimbing out.

    For a moment we see what only SOHELsees: which is a little 
      convoy of police cars and train company vehicles arrive in 
    the distance.

      SOHELhurries away.



      LAURIE charges down the carriage, to find a melee by the door 
    as passengers queue up to get out of the train.

                                      LAURIE
                    What do you think you re doing?

                                    JAMAL
                    What does it bloody look like? 
                    Unlawful imprisonment, this is.

      JAMAL jumps.

                                      KIMBERLEY
                    Wait for me!

    Now KIMBERLEY jumps, to ROWAN s alarm. 

                                    ROWAN
                    Kimberley, no!

      LAURIE appears in the doorway to find JAMAL helping KIMBERLEY 
    up. And here s DANNY, pulling himself to his feet, winded and 
      nursing his pride.

                                      LAURIE
                    What happened to you?

                                    DANNY
                    Pushed me out of bloody carriage.

    He indicates SOHEL, now some way off. JAMAL walks away too.

                                      KIMBERLEY
                              (to Rowan)
                    Come on!

    So ROWAN jumps out too, and the girls set off after him.

                                      LAURIE
                    Mum, I m going to have to get off 
                    the train, it s armageddonout 
                    there.

                                    JEN
                    Don t be long.



                                                                                26                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      LAURIE climbs out of the train to join DANNY.

                                    DANNY
                    You got any idea how many forms I m 
                    going to have to fill in after this 
                    adventure...

                                      LAURIE
                    I m a police officer. Filling in 
                    forms is what I do. 

      Behind her, GERARD has climbed out and is holding up his arms 
    to JEN.

                                      GERARD
                    Come on, love, I ll catch you.

                                      LAURIE
                    You will not! 

                                    JEN
                    I don t mind him catching me.

                                      LAURIE
                    You re staying on that train!
                              (toGerard)
                    You came out to go walking, right? 
                    So off you go. Ten miles in those 
                    boots by teatime. 

      GERARD walks away, glowering.

    It is at this point that the British Transport Police walk 
    up, and find LAURIE apparently leading a passenger revolt.

    The officers are both uniformed men: SGT DON PARKER, 40s, and 
      andPC PAUL TAIT, small and thin, in his mid 20s.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    What the hell is going on here? Get 
                    those people back on the train.

                                      LAURIE
                    I did my best, but they ve all got 
                    places they d rather be, sarge.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    I d rather be in Lanzarotemyself 
                    but I ve got a job to do.

                                      LAURIE
                    Since it s clearly a suicide...

                                    SGT PARKER
                    I don t think that s for you to 
                    judge, is it.



                                                                                27                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      LAURIE shows her warrant card, and he peers at the name.

                                      LAURIE
                    DC Laura Franklin. The driver says 
                    she threw herself off that bridge 
                    with open arms...

                                    DANNY
                    Those two lads I saw on the track, 
                    they must have seen her.

                                      LAURIE
                    Witnesses, good.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    OK, Miss Franklin, I should say 
                    that s quite enough of you for now, 
                    so why don t you get your tanks off 
                    my lawn and think about what you ll 
                    say to your gaffer when you get a 
                    tug tomorrow for unauthorized 
                    evacuation of a train. 
                              (toPc Tait)
                    Shove this numptyand her mates in 
                    a corner and glower the buggery out 
                    of the lot of them. Where is my 
                    driver?

    He marches off towards PAT. DANNY gives LAURIE a look - 
      aren t you going to stand up to those cheeky gits?

                                      LAURIE
                              (dismissive)
                    Railway bill.

    But when he smiles and turns away, she checks her watch again 
    and despairs. 



      A busy market, many Asian customers.

      COLLY is at a stall, picking babygrosand nappiesand little 
      jackets. She is also on the mobile phone.

                                    COLLY
                    No, pet, I understand, of course. 
                    No worries. Hope you feel better 
                    soon.

    She rings off and tries again.

                                    COLLY (CONT D)
                    Hi, it s Colly Trent. Listen, love, 
                    I ve got an emergency just come in 
                    this morning, and the fostering 
                    service said... Oh no! Sorry, I 
                    didn t know... not serious I hope? 
                    Yeah, good luck now, OK. 

    She finds one last piece of baby clothing - something bright 
      green. It makes her smile. 

    As COLLY queues to pay, she thinks hard. She takes a deep 
      breath, makes a reluctant decision and dials one last number. 

                                    COLLY (CONT D)
                    Nick?

                                    NICK
                              (out of phone)
                    Colette.



      A kindly looking white man in his forties is doing the bucket 
    and spade routine with a little silent mixed race black girl 
      aged five or six.

    The man is NICHOLAS  NICK  DURDEN, the child his natural 
      daughter GEMMA. 

                                    NICK
                              (into phone)
                    Long time since I heard your voice.

      Intercut:



                                                                                30                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    NICK (CONT D)
                    You must be desperate.

                                    COLLY
                    I ve got an abandoned babyand I 
                    understand you re still approved. 
                    Are you able to take him? Nick? 

                                    NICK
                    I m in Scarborough with Gemma.

                                    COLLY
                    His name s Michael.There are no 
                    medical concerns.

    He thinks about it just for a moment. COLLY crosses her 
      fingers.

                                    NICK
                    I must be mad.

                                    COLLY
                    Thanks, Nick.

      NICK ends the call and gets down to the little girl s level.

                                    NICK
                    Now then. What do you reckon to the 
                    idea of a baby brother?

      GEMMA s not at all sure she s in favour of that. She gives 
    him a bucket of pebbles, and he stands up.

      NICK starts to skip the pebbles out across the sea.

      They run a ripple effect out into the water.

      NICK and GEMMA laugh with delight.



      LAURIE hurries JEN out of the town centre railway station. 

      They reach the taxi rank. There is a queue, and JEN is 
      panting a bit.

                                      LAURIE
                    Oh look at this.
                              (tothe queue)
                    Do you mind, my mother s got a 
                    hospital appointment, do you mind 
                    if we...

    But the queue shuffles intently together, without looking at 
      LAURIE, doing that strange English thing, blanking her 
      without speaking to her...

                                      LAURIE (CONT D)
                    Yeah right thankyoutoo.

      LAURIE catches sight of DANNY, walking across the road to a 
      minicab waiting in the nearby car park.

                                      LAURIE (CONT D)
                    Danny! Danny!

    She sees a middleagedAsian driver, IBRAHIM IBRA  AKRAM, get 
    out of the cab and open his arms to DANNY. The men hug tight.

    She pauses for a moment, then goes for it anyway.

                                      LAURIE (CONT D)
                    Danny!

    He breaks off his hug and looks round at her, a bit 
      unwelcoming.



      LAURIE and JEN in the back of IBRA s taxi, DANNY in the front 
      passenger seat.

                                      LAURIE
                    It s really kind of you.

                                    IBRA
                    It s on our way, pretty much.

                                      LAURIE
                    It s just if you re in a hurry...

                                    DANNY
                    It s fine, really.

    He is checking his watch. It s not really fine.


                                                                                32                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    IBRA
                    You ve got no chance anyway, now.

      A beat, and DANNY relaxes, and smiles. He is trying to agree 
      it s fine after all.

                                    JEN
                    Very nice having your own personal 
                    taxi driver.

                                    DANNY
                    Except for the earache. Never stops 
                    talking, this one.

                                    IBRA
                    Just sociable. Might as well be 
                    friendly as not, isn t it?

      IBRA is a bright, cheerful Pakistani in his 40s, who came to 
      this country as a small child. He drives fast and likes to 
      chat. 

                                    JEN
                    Where are you from then?

                                      LAURIE
                    Oh, I m sorry, she asks everyone.

                                    IBRA
                    No problem. I m from Skipton.

    He laughs. And then catches LAURIE s eye in his mirror.

                                      LAURIE
                    Her appointment was supposed to be 
                    12o clock.

                                    IBRA
                    In a hurry, yeah? Join the club! 
                    Look at this traffic, mad innit.
                    Where they all going, all these 
                    people? 

                                    JEN
                    We were on the train before.

                                    IBRA
                    Rubbish trains, taxis better!

                                    DANNY
                    Careful!

    The men giggle. JENperseveres.

                                    JEN
                    A girl went under our train. Killed 
                    herself. On purpose. 


                                                                                33                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



      IBRA s face in the mirror, smiling indulgently.

                                    IBRA
                    That s right, love. That s why 
                    Danny boy called me out.

                                    JEN
                    She was one of yourgirls.

      IBRA s face, no longer smiling.

                                      LAURIE
                    Mum...

                                    IBRA
                    An Asian girl?
                              (to Danny)
                    You never said.

                                    JEN
                    You might know her.

                                      LAURIE
                    Mum, just because she was Asian... 

                                    IBRA
                    No, your Mum s right, if she were 
                    from round here I probably do know 
                    her. Know everybody, me.

    He laughs. And then catches LAURIE s eye in his mirror.

                                    IBRA (CONT D)
                    Sad world innit, love, sometimes.
                              (beat)
                    It s against our religion, you 
                    know.

                                    DANNY
                    Suicide? You could have fooled me.

      A beat. And IBRA laughs.

                                    IBRA
                    See the respect my son-in-law shows 
                    me. 

    But they are both laughing, the best of friends really.

                                    IBRA (CONT D)
                    Everybody doing wishful thinking, 
                      innit.We ve got lads think all you 
                    got to do is grow a long beard and 
                    tie a bloody scarf round your 
                    bloody head and that makes you a 
                    Muslim.

                                    IBRA (CONT D)
                    And we ve got politicians think all 
                    they got to do is shout louder. 

                                    DANNY
                    You ve sent him off on one now!

                                      LAURIE
                              (ignoring Danny)
                    And what do youthink?

      A beat, and IBRA is now serious.

                                    IBRA
                    I think you can t just do what you 
                    like with the body God gave you.

    JEN is starting to look a bit green.

                                    JEN
                    Are we nearly there?

                                      LAURIE
                    You re not going to...

                                    JEN
                    I ll be all right! Ooh, you do 
                    fuss.



      IBRA s taxi draws up outside the hospital. 

    JEN and LAURIE get out.

                                      LAURIE
                    How much?

                                    IBRA
                    Don t even think about it.

                                      LAURIE
                    No, I must...

                                    DANNY
                    I ll be charging him to the train 
                    company anyway.

                                      LAURIE
                    Give us your card so I can get you 
                    later. 

                                    IBRA
                    Wanting a free ride home and all 
                    are you?

    But he gives her the card, laughing.  


                                                                                35                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



    As the women walk away, IBRA looks at DANNY, puzzled why he 
      never said the dead girl was Asian. DANNY sighs.

                                    DANNY
                    Something about seeing her like 
                    that. A Muslim girl, dead like 
                    that. Something...
                              (beat)
                    Something a bit close to home.



      LAURIE and JEN hurry to the hospital entrance.



      Danny hurries along the street carrying flowers, late and *
      worried about it.*



                                                                                39                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009




      DANNY, carrying a bunch of flowers, reaches a restaurant with 
      lots of tables outside. 

      A young Asian woman sits at one of them, drinking coffee. She 
    is wearing jeans and a bomber jacket with a dark headscarf.
      This is Danny s wife NUSRAT, daughter of the taxi driver 
      IBRA. 

      DANNY breaks into a huge grin when he sees her. 

                                      NUSRAT
                    Even on a normal day I d say 
                    turning up hours late is grounds 
                    for divorce. On a day when we were 
                    supposed to be playing happy 
                    families for our social worker...

                                    DANNY
                    Was she angry?

                                      NUSRAT
                    No, she was cool.

    She is thrilled with the piece of news she now gives him.

                                      NUSRAT (CONT D)
                    She said they give you the 
                    questions in advance.

                                    DANNY
                              (amazed)
                    How far in advance?

                                      NUSRAT
                    Just like 15 minutes or whatever. 
                    Just while you re sitting outside 
                    waiting to go in. Are those for me 
                    or one of your other wives?

      DANNY laughs and gives her the flowers. She looks at him: so 
      what have I done to deserve these?

                                    DANNY
                    We re going to walk it.

    He grabs the menu and looks down at it. When he looks up, 
      NUSRAT is trying not to cry.

                                    DANNY (CONT D)
                    Oh, love. This is all good news. 

                                      NUSRAT
                    It feels like we re giving up. 

      A beat. DANNY could cry too. 


                                                                                40                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    DANNY
                    We ve been all over this. 

                                      NUSRAT
                    Everyone says the minute you adopt 
                    a child one of your own comes along 
                    too. 

                                    DANNY
                    You ve got to let it go, Nuss.You 
                    know that s the deal.

      NUSRAT gets a grip. The conversation is over. She looks round 
    for a waitress.

                                      NUSRAT
                    Let s get you a drink.
                              (beat)
                    So, what sort of day you had, Tommy 
                    the Tank?

      DANNY looks at her. He smiles wearily.

                                    DANNY
                    Nothing special. 

    She looks up, sees through him.

                                      NUSRAT
                    You re about three weekslate...

                                    DANNY
                    Two!

                                      NUSRAT
                    ... and I got flowers.

    He is unwilling to tell her, but we know he will.

      From across the road, we see him start to tell her about the 
      incident on the train. We see her sit forward, intensely 
      interested.

      PASSERSBY, traffic, the rest of the world, all begin to 
      obscure the couple.



      A train thunders by as night begins to fall.



    SGT PARKER watches a couple of OFFICERS removing the crime *
      scene tape.*

    PC TAIT walks up to him, carrying an evidence bag containing *
    the trainer.*

                                    SGT PARKER*
                    Another day, another dollar, *
                    another bloody jumper making a mess *
                    of my railway.*

                                    PC TAIT*
                    Is that it then?*

                                    SGT PARKER*
                    Yeah, this is the bit where you get *
                    to buy me a pint.*

      They start to walk away.*



                                                                                43                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    PC TAIT*
                    I ve never quite got my head round *
                    it, sarge.*

                                    SGT PARKER*
                    And then I get to buy you one. *
                    What s your problem?*

                                    PC TAIT*
                    No, I mean I ve never quite got my *
                    head round why, when someone kills *
                    themself, we automatically classify *
                    it as non-suspicious.*

                                    SGT PARKER*
                    She jumped in front of a train, *
                    Paul. The driver saw her do it. *
                    We re not even talking  cry for *
                    help  here. She got what she *
                    wanted, and what I want is a pint.*

    As they walk away, behind them the body is being loaded into *
    an undertaker s van. *



    The hospital looking a bit spooky as the lights come on.



    MAL exits the pool in a tracksuit, his hair still damp, calm 
    and cheerful.

    He laughs when he sees anxious SGT PARKER waiting for him in 
    off duty clothes.

                                    MAL
                    Smile, old love, this is fun.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    All right, yes, it was an unusual 
                    one, you don t see a lot of jumpers 
                    wearing burkas, but unusual s not 
                    enough to justifysuspicious, is 
                    it. 

      They walk away towards a car.

                                    MAL
                    So you screwed up, but we re on it 
                    now, look, here we are, on it.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    And then Natalie Cryer rings up 
                    about this bloody baby...



                                                                                51                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009



                                    MAL
                    Don, save your worrying, all right.

                                    SGT PARKER
                    Easy for you to say. You didn t 
                    classify the death non-suspicious.

                                    MAL
                              (laughing)
                    Save it till thingsreally go 
                    wrong.


      BECOMES SCENE 80A8484



    The hospital looking spooky and not at all safe.



      A train thunders by.



    PAT the train driver, weaving out of the pub, alone and quite 
      drunk.



      A pavement runs alongside the train track. PAT weaves his way 
      along it, as the train passes behind him.



    PAT turns the corner into a street he knows.

      It s hard to see clearly, but there are one or two WOMEN 
      waiting in doorways.

    One woman steps forward and offers him business. PAT pushes 
    her away.

                                    PAT
                    No, not you.

    He reaches another one, and rejects her too.

                                    PAT (CONT D)
                    Where is she?

      PAT, desperate, running and stumbling down the road.

                                    PAT (CONT D)
                    Where is she?



      A scruffy high rise council block. Windswept, littered, 
      distant sirens.


                                                                                58                           EPISODE ONE - AMENDS - 25/09/2009
