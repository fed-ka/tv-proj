FADE UP:
Moving through a tract development. The houses are like
Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just
mixed differently.
A gloomy night, no moon. And a slightly ominous pattern
emerges...
Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut
brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and
pizza joint flyers.
Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or, worse, seemingly
abandoned. This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town.
A deep, commanding voice pierces the silence:
VOICE (O.S.)
Defy reason. Defy everything you
know.
Now we move in on one of the homes. Not the nicest on the
block, but inhabited. Lights on in the windows.
MUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH
ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before.
In the daylight it seems nice. Charming, even.
Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes
in the street. Mothers unload groceries. Neighbors chat.
DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
.so get out there and enjoy this
beautiful Wednesday, people.
We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing
MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the
rear window.
The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns don't seem nearly so
foreboding now.
We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the WALL
that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time
that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT, ARID DESERT.
In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas
proper. It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked
Pleasure Island.
4.
CLOSE ON:
The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street.
WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER, who is PUSHING the bike as
fast as he can. It STARTS, sputters -- then craps out.
CHARLIE
(to the bike/pissed)
You want me to take you apart, huh?
Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who
just recently came into his body and good looks.
He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite
trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
(still talking to bike)
I will. I'll sell you for parts.
Don't think I won't--
Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches
him talk to his bike. Paused as she hauls her trash cans to
the curb.
She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her
ridiculous body. Stripper city. She nods to the bike,
amused.
DORIS
Nothing doing, huh?
CHARLIE
The thing's got no ambition.
(re: trash cans)
Can I -- uh, give you a hand?
DORIS
I got it. Thanks.
She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word "LUCKY" across
the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice
his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb.
JANE
Don't leer at the neighbors, kid.
Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE
brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb.
5.
He and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship
which has only recently started to have more edge.
CHARLIE
She's the one who put a word on her
butt. I'm just reading it.
Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in
front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.
JANE
Is he ever going to move that
thing?
CHARLIE
You need to get over it, Mom.
JANE
(WATCH IT)
Attitude.
(observes him/then)
You've been tense or something.
School?
CHARLIE
School's great, actually.
JANE
Amy?
CHARLIE
Good. Hasn't dumped me yet.
He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.
JANE
That'll teach you to get so tall
and handsome.
(THEN)
Getting what you want is stressful.
Especially when you're not used to
it. More to lose.
CHARLIE
Are you reading those books again?
The Power of Whatever the Hell?
She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
They're not working. You're still
flipping out about a big box.
6.
Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN
HOUSE SIGNS into her trunk. Charlie stands there. She
shoots him a look -- then he helps her load.
JANE
It's an eyesore. I'm trying to
convince people to move in, not
join the legions leaving town--
CHARLIE
If you say "mortgage crisis" again
I'm getting a new mom.
JANE
The guy moves in and puts a giant
trash can in his yard! When the
Perry's lived there--
Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.
CHARLIE
The Perry's were the greatest
neighbors ever. But they moved. I
thought you were happy their place
finally sold.
JANE
(back on the neighbor)
He's not digging a pool. Where do
you think all that concrete's
coming from?
CHARLIE
You're spying on the guy now?
JANE
He's thirteen feet from our house.
That's not spying, that's
observing.
A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot
friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back.
AMY
Hi, Mrs. Brewster.
JANE
Hi honey. Hi girls.
ANY, 16, is a stunner. And she's as cool as she is beautiful
-- the girl every other guy in school would die to be with.
7.
But Charlie is. And he can't believe his luck. Which puts
him off his game. She makes him feel like he's always
playing catch up.
Charlie moves toward the VW. Jane calls after him.
JANE (CONT'D)
Oh hey -- Ed called. Again.
CHARLIE
Okay.
JANE
I'm tired of making excuses,
Charlie. If you don't want to talk
to him, would you please tell him?
CHARLIE
Kinda defeats the purpose.
He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.
AMY
Still can't get the bike started,
huh?
CHARLIE
Wow. No faith.
AMY
So you don't need a ride.
Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs
his backpack and RACES after her.
CHARLIE
No, hey, stop--
She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she
drives again.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Come on! Hey!--
Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst. The
girls are laughing.
ON JANE
Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit.
8.
The Beetle zips through a commercial strip. More suburban
paradise.
Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the
wheel. Casually drops one on Charlie's leg. Charlie tries
to act casual, but he's stoked and... amazed.
Cara half-sleeps in the back while BEE leans forward, flirty,
and eyes Charlie's COLORFUL PUMA SNEAKERS. Charlie's a
sneakerhead, a serious collector.
BEE
Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck.
AMY
Charlie.
BEE
Chuck likes it when I call him
Chuck, right Chuck?
Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort.
CHARLIE
It's -- they're not -- that's,
like, puce? That's a macho puce.
CARA
Can you stop someplace? I'm
severely under-caffeinated.
AMY
(ignores her/to Bee)
Did you see the poster for the
formal? The theme is "Hope"?
BEE
I know. They asked me to be on the
committee again but I was like --
hope is completely 2008. Grow up.
CHARLIE
Did you suggest "Despair?" Nobody
would see that coming. Or --
global warming? Everybody has to
wear tin foil.
AMY
(laughs/to Charlie)
Did you go last year? We basically
did the whole thing, Bee and me.
9.
CHARLIE
(LIES)
Me? I, ah, was in training that
week. This big triatha--
BEE
(cutting him off)
Chuck was still under his rock.
We're so glad you crawled out.
CARA
Caffeine!? Hello!
CHARLIE
I have Econ first period.
Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices.
CARA
Charrrliiieeeee.
CHARLIE
(KILLING HIM)
Okay. Yeah. It's no big deal.
Amy PULLS into a coffee place. Parks. The girls climb out.
CARA
Thank you, Jesus.
Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting.
AMY
You're not going to flunk for
missing Econ, Brain.
CHARLIE
Brain? I -- what? No, I'm--
But she's already walking away.
AMY
Five minutes.
He watches her move off, anxious and smitten.
Charlie arrives with Amy, Cara and Bee -- all the girls now
sport coffee drinks. Charlie has one too, with whipped cream
and the works.
10.
Kids stream into a nice, modern-looking high school. Amy
takes Charlie's arm.
AMY
On time. You stress too much.
CHARLIE
I wasn't worried.
AMY
You were doing your worried thing.
CHARLIE
I was? I have a -- what's my--
MARK (O.S.)
Ladies!
A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up
along side Charlie and the girls. They draw looks from other
students as they move through the courtyard.
The cool kids.
BEE
Doods. Looking massive.
MARK
(to Charlie/re: drink)
Seriously? A Mochachino? You
can't ride with the girls anymore.
You let them brush your hair, My
Pretty Pony?
Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it.
BEE
(takes his arm)
Chuck's secure, aren't you?
We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design.
It's a thing. Charlie shows his off -- he's secure.
CHARLIE
Puce.
BEN
Fuck yeah.
AMY
(TO CHARLIE)
I have track after school, maybe we
can hook up later?
11.
CHARLIE
Yeah. Hey. Come here.
(pulls her aside/awkward)
You know, the formal. Don't think
I wasn't going to ask you, because
I thought it was an obvious go.
Together. Hope, puppies, kittens,
the whole deal. You and me.
AMY
(NOT UNKIND)
Oh, no. Please. Nobody goes to
the dance senior year.
She smiles, moves off. He watches her, lets out a breath.
CHARLIE
Right. I knew that.
MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow.
Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie:
MARK
Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp
man? Make a sacrifice to the hot
ass Gods? How do you get that?
CHARLIE
Game, my friend. Rock solid.
Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we
see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a
bitch. Mark calls after him--
MARK
You don't even have a car!
The sun has set behind the mountains. It's gloomy gray out,
right before dark.
Charlie and AMY park, climb out of her car with drinks from
PLANET SMOOTHIE in hand. She's still in her track and field
clothes. Looks tough.
AMY
You know what I want? For dinner?
CHARLIE
You're eating right now, you know.
As you speak. You literally just
forced me to get you a smoothie so
large they named a planet after it--
AMY
(LAUGHS)
I ran six miles. What did you do?
CHARLIE
I -- watched you. But not in a
creepy way.
Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.
AMY
So don't judge. You don't want me
to burn my big ole' booty off, do
you?
Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her.
AMY (CONT'D)
What was that for?
CHARLIE
I don't know you're just...
AMY
What?
16.
CHARLIE
(PERFECT)
Nothing.
A sweet moment. These two have a definite thing. It's real.
They're about to kiss again when JANE'S GIRLISH LAUGH stops
them. They both turn and REACT AS THEY SEE...
A MUSCLED MALE, SQUATTING AND HUNCHED-OVER -- clad only in a
white wife-beater and jeans. We can't make out his face.
Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he
FIXES their sprinkler.
PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome
to the point of devastating. An all-American Adonis.
AMY
Wow.
CHARLIE
Look at Mom. She's
AMY
Damn right. If he followed her
home, you have to let her keep him.
Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment.
ED paces anxiously in front of ADAM'S HOUSE. He has a duffle
bag over his shoulder. Keeps checking his phone.
He finally dials in a number. Talks--
ADAM
Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's.
Remember the videos we all made
back when? You and me and Adam,
bro? In tights. Want your pals to
get a load of that?
Amy and Charlie approach Jane and Jerry. They overhear--
JANE
.so not a pool, what's the work
you're doing?
17.
Jerry has an easy-going way about him. An inviting charm.
JERRY
Foundation problems. I had to rip
up half the basement.
JANE
These houses were built practically
overnight. I'm never surprised
when they come apart.
JERRY
(RE: SPRINKLER)
Done. Just needed a new stem.
Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching. And gaping.
JANE
Jerry, this is my son Charlie. And
his -- do we say girlfriend now?
CHARLIE
(EMBARRASSED)
I guess. I mean -- only if she's--
Amy's amused at Charlie's squirming, finally saves him.
AMY
(shakes Jerry's hand)
Hi. I'm Amy.
He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She
enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie.
Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes
manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand
a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit.
CHARLIE
Hey.
JANE
Jerry's our new neighbor. The
Perry place. He's "handy."
AMY
(looks to Charlie, smiles)
No kidding.
JERRY
Sorry about the mess, man. I was
just telling your mom I'll have the
dumpster gone next week.
18.
CHARLIE
Doesn't bother me.
JANE
Jerry does night construction on
the strip.
JERRY
(noticing Charlie's shoes)
You play ball? I'm always looking
for a pick up game.
CHARLIE
(BLUFFING)
Now and then, you know.
JANE
It's more of a collector thing.
The shoes. He's obsessed.
(to Jerry/"those teens")
They sleep on sidewalks to get
them.
Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me.
JERRY
Well -- they're bold. I like them.
Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.
JERRY (CONT'D)
So... I'd ask you guys inside, but
it's a mess. I've been meaning to.
JANE
Be neighborly.
JERRY
A drink, something.
It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Soon, okay?
JANE
You bet. And thank you so much.
For the help.
JERRY
Least I could do.
Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves
off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed.
19.
AMY
Why did you blow him off? Oh my
God!
JANE
A guy that good-looking, still
single? Bad bet. He's a player.
CHARLIE
(IMPRESSED)
Mom. Breaking it down.
JANE
I've had enough man trouble. I'm
not getting suckered again.
Amy and Charlie meet eyes. That was loaded. Jane notices.
JANE (CONT'D)
Don't listen to me. Jaded old
BROAD--
CHARLIE
MOM--
Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it.
ON THE PHONE
A VIDEO CLIP from ED. TITLED "KID COMEBACK and SUPER SQUID!"
It shows Charlie, Ed and Adam when they were younger,
prancing around in homemade costumes and, indeed, tights.
The text message says "10 MINUTES -- OR THIS IS GOING WIDE!"
ON CHARLIE
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
(alarmed/to Amy)
Wow. Okay. I gotta go. Sorry.
Call you later.
AMY
Now?
JANE
I have dinner on--
CHARLIE
I gotta go. I'll eat later.
JANE
Charlie!
20.
But Charlie's already off and running.
Charlie approaches, sees ED pacing in front of the house.
He's flipping out.
ED
Where the hell have you been?
CHARLIE
You said after school, chill out!
Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door.
ED
Right after! It's dusk, dude, you
know what that means!?
CHARLIE
That the sun's gone down. What's
THE BIG--
Over him, Ed knocks loudly. Rings the bell.
ED
Hey! Anybody home?
A long pause. Nothing.
CHARLIE
Not here. Let's go--
But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle.
A while later. It's REALLY DARK now.
Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a
residential street. Houses here are spaced far apart and the
lights in many of them are off.
Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark
corner is potentially the end of him.
A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps
GAINING. Ed abandons his skateboard and BOLTS.
A hand SLAMS on his shoulder, spins him around. IT's MARK,
Charlie's pal from school.
MARK
You crossed my yard. Tracked your
nerdjuice all over it.
26.
ED
Sorry. Sorry--
MARK
My mom works hard on that shit,
MORON--
Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything... else
could be out there.
ED
Can you just hit me? I don't have
time for the build up.
(he steels himself)
Go.
MARK
Seriously?
ED
Jesus, man! Just do it!
Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow.
Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels.
The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has
experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to
shake Mark for a moment.
Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS
CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on
the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.
ED (CONT'D)
Crap. Crap!
There's not time to get the stuff. He can hear Mark
approaching in the dark.
He drops into a neighbor's backyard.
ED spins and slams right into MARK -- no, it's JERRY.
Ed falls back and scrambles away, terrified.
ED (CONT'D)
Get away! I'm armed mother fucker!
Jerry moves after Ed, angry but controlled. More like a man
than a monster.
27.
Mark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence. Sees Ed's
VAMP HUNTING STUFF on the ground, laughs.
MARK
Unbelievable.
A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done.
He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off.
Ed trips over kid's toys and bikes as he runs to the house.
There's a porch light on over the back door.
ED
(pounding on door)
Hey! Let me in! Please!
But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing
in, walking across the backyard.
Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink.
Ed races for the back gate--
AND SUDDENLY JERKS TO A STOP.
Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS he's wearing.
Ed's lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN, until he's choking
on it, the cross directly under his neck.
JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the
cross into the neighbor's POOL.
Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair.
Jerry's standing over him. Smiles a little. We get just a
flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH, sharper, in rows. It's
chilling.
JERRY
Bit off more than you can chew.
Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.
ED
We'll see, man. I know my shit.
But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with
actual sympathy.
JERRY
Really? Who's going to believe
you? You see the truth, but what
good is it when you're alone?
Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on.
ED
Don't play that stuff. That mind
crap. Come on -- try me. Try me!
29.
JERRY
You say you're glad you're
different. But how can you be in a
place like this? These people...
Even your best friend. You're
nothing to him now.
Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a
step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less
conviction.
ED
Get back!
JERRY
It can be over. I can make all
that pain go away.
Ed's fighting tears. Life as he knows it is gone.
ED
No...
JERRY
You were born for this and you know
it. Your "life", what you had?
That's the illusion.
(off Ed's silence)
I can take you somewhere great.
Somewhere you'll belong.
Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it...hope?
JERRY (CONT'D)
It's a gift.
And Jerry moves closer, blocking our view.
CUT TO BLACK:
FADE UP ON:
A new day. Sunny and hot. A truck moves the DUMPSTER from
Jerry's house.
Amy and Charlie head to the car. Charlie turns -- looks back
at JERRY'S HOUSE. The blacked out windows...
AMY
What?
Charlie snaps out of it. It's crazy to even entertain Ed's
theories.
31
CHARLIE
Nothing. That guy was such a tool.
AMY
(HUMORING HIM)
Totally. Poser.
She gets in the car. Smiles a little.
FADE TO:
Charlie, Mark, Ben and the rest of the guys get ready for
practice. Mark's in the middle of a story, but Charlie is
distracted -- barely listening.
MARK
.she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude.
Like -- one zip and POP!
CHARLIE
Huh.
32
MARK
What's up with you? Dreaming about
your little boyfriend?
Charlie takes this in, worried.
CHARLIE
You see him around today? Ed?
BEN
I don't track "it's" whereabouts.
What did he want, anyway?
CHARLIE
Nothing. Homework stuff.
But Charlie's clearly distracted.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Look, I have to go.
MARK
Now? You're ditching? I'll bail
with you.
CHARLIE
No -- I'm -- I don't feel so well.
He takes off. Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed.
Another suburban development. Rows and rows of red tile
roofs, houses stacked right on top of one another...
Charlie rings the bell of a modest place. Not as big as
where Charlie and Jane live. But nice, well-tended for.
ED's mom, VICTORIA, answers. She's surprised to see him.
VICTORIA
Charlie!
CHARLIE
Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee.
Victoria breaks into a wide smile.
VICTORIA
God you're a sight for sore eyes.
33.
It's dark as Charlie comes home. He looks warily at Jerry's
house as he searches for his keys.
BAM -- he walks right into JERRY.
JERRY
Hey guy.
Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed
thought? Impossible, but...
CHARLIE
Hey. Guy.
JERRY
You could really do me a solid.
CHARLIE
Yeah? What kind.
JERRY
I have a girl on her way over for a
beer, and I'm totally out of beer.
They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the
kitchen.
CHARLIE
Bummer.
JERRY
Set me up, I'll pay you back two
times. A sixer for your mom, and
one for you.
CHARLIE
Uh, yeah, sure.
36.
Jerry watches Charlie as he unlocks the door.
This is when Charlie should invite him in.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Let me see what Mom's got. She's
kind of a "light domestic".. .mom.
Charlie steps inside. Pointedly DOESN'T ask Jerry to enter.
Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the
refrigerator. But keeps his eyes on Jerry. If he steps in,
uninvited, Ed's theory is blown.
JERRY
Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as
my place, huh?
Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE
THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit.
Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over
Jerry's face.
Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his
hand -- it hits the ground, explodes.
CHARLIE
Fuck!
JERRY
Can I help you with that?
CHARLIE
No! No. Thanks. I'll get it.
Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly
certain. He's been made.
Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the
doorway with the remaining beers.
Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
There you go. Uh...party down.
Jerry watches him, intense. His tone shifts -- cocky and
intimidating. A threat disguised as "guy talk."
JERRY
This girl tonight -- she's a
handful. You know.
(MORE)
37.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Women who look a certain way, they
need to be managed.
CHARLIE
Yeah.
JERRY
You don't mind my saying, you got a
lot on your shoulders for a kid.
Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must
be a line of guys dying to pluck
that. Your mom too -- you don't
see it, maybe you do -- she's
giving it off. It's on you to
watch out for them. You up for
that?
Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.
CHARLIE
I think I can manage.
JERRY
Good. Cause there are bad people
out there, man. Better keep an eye
on your women.
Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Thanks for the beers.
Charlie watches him move into the dark.
A short while later. Charlie moves cautiously into Jerry's
backyard. He's wearing ALL BLACK and his dad's old winter
gloves. He looks at his iPhone.
ON THE PHONE -- a diagram. "How to pick a lock."
42.
Charlie steels his nerves. At Jerry's back door, he clumsily
tries to pick the lock. After a moment or two, he realizes
he has no idea what he's doing.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Crap.
He walks away from the door, frustrated. Then turns and
impulsively tries to KICK IN the DOOR with his foot. Nothing
happens.
Then something occurs to Charlie. He goes into the garden.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
The Perrys...
Charlie finds a FAKE ROCK. Turns it over. It has a KEY in
it. Charlie's like -- duh.
He puts the key in the back door lock. It opens.
The sun is just starting to rise. Charlie races for his
house, with Doris holding on to him tight. She's crying with
gratitude and relief, manages--
DORIS
Thank you, thank you...
Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins
going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them.
CHARLIE
Doris?
In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop
it as she GOES UP IN FLAMES and explodes.
CHARLIE REACTS
Horrified. In shock.
Later. Charlie approaches the school. Kids swarm around
him, happy and care-free. Charlie's in another world.
Charlie and Amy sit in the busy quad.
CHARLIE
We can't hang out at my house any
more. My mom's flipping out about
some stuff. I can see you at
school, but for a while --
AMY
Why? What's going on?
CHARLIE
It's hard to explain. Just...
What can he say? He has to protect her, but how?
BEN AND MARK Join them. Notice how tweaked Charlie looks.
BEN
You look like dog shit.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
MARK
Your pal the spaz, his folks were
here earlier. It's a big thing.
CHARLIE
What? Why?
51.
MARK
I don't know. He ran away or
something. They were all upset,
talking to the principal.
BEN
One less tweaker clogging up the
halls.
Charlie stands, upset.
CHARLIE
Shut up.
MARK BEN
Charlie-- Chill out-
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
You don't know what you're talking
about. He could be dead for all
you know.
Mark steps in. Calming, reasonable.
MARK
You're right. Not cool. You're
worried and it's totally
understandable.
(THEN)
But he's better off, man. He'll be
happier with the other trolls on
the shire.
That's it. Charlie DECKS MARK. They go to the ground and
Charlie lets loose on him. A bunch of other guys pull them
apart amid shouts, etc.
Mark is bloodied and freaked.
MARK (CONT'D)
What the fuck man!?
AMY stands back, appalled.
AMY
Charlie!! What the hell is wrong
with you?!
CHARLIE
(TO MARK)
You're an idiot, you know that?
(SUPER EMPHATIC)
And it's HOBBITS on the shire!
52.
Charlie turns to Amy--
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Come on.
But she shakes her head and moves to MARK and BEN.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
AMY--
AMY
Just get out of here, Charlie. Go.
He knows it's over. Heartbroken, he takes off.
FADE TO:
Charlie gets off the bus and walks toward one of the nicer
hotels.
He's looking at another "how to" on his phone. "How to meet
a celebrity."
Moving in on the Brewster home, an odd sight is revealed.
Every window is draped with strings of GARLIC.
Charlie's revealed in his window -- hammering up another long
rope of the stuff.
His gaze falls on JERRY'S HOUSE and we follow it.
JERRY stands at the door. Quietly enraged.
JANE
This is ridiculous--
JERRY
Jane. It's Jerry from next door--
CHARLIE
I'm telling you, don't answer it!
JANE
This is my house. I'll answer the
door if I want to.
She starts to move to the door again. Charlie blocks her
way, desperate.
CHARLIE
Mom. He murdered Ed and Adam. And
I have proof.
Jane is stunned, at a loss. From the other side of the door--
JERRY (O.S.)
Jane? I need to talk to you.
JANE
Just-- Hold on!
JERRY (O.S.)
Now. Your son is harassing me!
He pounds on the door. Jane examines Charlie closely.
63
JANE
Charlie. What's happening?
CHARLIE
Whatever he says, don't--
JERRY (O.S.)
He broke into my house. I'd rather
not take this to the authorities.
But I will! He's sick, deluded--
CHARLIE
Mom.
A tense beat... Finally--
JANE
(YELLS/ANGRY)
Get the authorities! My son is a
good kid!
Charlie sags with relief. A brief look of appreciation
passes between Charlie and Jane.
ON JERRY
As he backs away from the door. His expression goes cold.
He disappears into the dark.
Jerry stands back, intense. He's got to take care of this
problem NOW.
Jerry carries a SHOVEL and A SMALL SAW. He stalks into the
Brewster's backyard, where he's hidden from the street.
CLOSE ON JERRY
As he starts to DIG UNDERGROUND -- amazingly strong and
swift.
Jerry pulls up the NATURAL GAS LINE that leads to the
BREWSTER'S HOUSE. He SAWS IT OPEN AND LIGHTS THE END ON
FIRE.
y, Charlie and Jane race into the garage
66.
AMY
I can drive--
JANE
I drive!
They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener--
CHARLIE
Gun it Mom! Go!!!
Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it.
She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk
as she takes off.
Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into
an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!!
They narrowly avoid a head-on collision with a FIRE TRUCK.
ON JERRY
As he sees the dirt bike in the driveway. He jumps on.
Tries to start it. NO GO. Fuck.
Jane speeds down the street, which is wide and not heavily
trafficked here.
Unlike the planned community of Shadow Hills -- now we can
see we're surrounded by great expanses of empty DESERT.
JERRY'S TRUCK SMASHES REPEATEDLY into JANE'S.
AMY
My brother has a gun!
CHARLIE
Good to know! Is he here?!
JANE
Call the police! Anybody--
Jane manages to evade Jerry until --
The TRUCK SKIDS in a long arc in front of them and BLOCKS
THEM. Jane screeches to a halt.
JANE (CONT'D)
Oh hell.
In a flash, Jerry is out of the truck and coming for them.
CHARLIE
GO! Go! Don't stop!! Go--
Charlie steps on the accelerator, grabs the wheel and AIMS
THE CAR AT JERRY.
JANE
Charlie!!
They RUN JERRY OVER WITH A TERRIBLE THUDDDD!!! Amy and Jane
scream. Jane is aghast, stops the car.
JANE (CONT'D)
Oh my God!!
Charlie steps on her accelerator foot, the CAR ZOOMS FORWARD.
68.
AMY
Are you nuts!? You can't kill that
guy!
CHARLIE
You have no idea.
(TO JANE)
It's him or us. Mom. MOM.
Jane looks at him -- can feel that he's telling the truth.
Charlie's looking around as they speed down the highway, in
the rearview. NO JERRY anywhere.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Where is he? Where'd he go?
Everybody looks UP. The roof of the car.
BAM! Jerry's hand SHOOTS up through the FLOORBOARD under
Jane's feet.
Jane and Amy SCREAM!
CLOSE ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAR
JERRY'S EYE glares through the small hole. It's all BLACK.
No pupil. Freaky.
He's TEARING THROUGH METAL from the undercarriage of the car,
where he's clinging -- face up.
The more he rips away -- the more he reveals his face.
His veins and eyes are BLACK. His nose snout-like. And his
fangs emerge from lethal rows of jagged teeth, like a SHARK.
It's shocking, horrible.
ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR
As Jerry drags over the highway, the pavement grinding away
at his clothes and flesh.
He reaches through the hole he's made and SLAMS his fist down
on the FLOOR BREAK. The car SCREECHES to a sudden halt.
ON CHARLIE, AMY and JANE
Screaming even after the car has stopped. Then -- BAM!! The
car is REAR-ENDED by another vehicle. It's a MINIVAN.
JANE's car is SLAMMED -- the back is a crush of glass and
metal.
69.
A GRIM MOMENT -- only the sound of hissing air and groaning
steel as everyone assesses the damage.
AMY
Oh... Are you-- Jane?
Jane is woozy. Hurt.
CHARLIE
Mom?
JANE
I'm okay...
Charlie sees that the other car is drivable. The guy inside,
a FAMILY MAN, is stunned and pissed. Gets out of his car--
FAMILY MAN
What the hell do you think you're
doing!--
Charlie gets out of the car too. Yells, urgent--
CHARLIE
NO! Hey man, stay in your--
But it's too late. The guy is met by a HORRIFIC Jerry,
hideously torn and bleeding, who appears from UNDER JANE'S
CAR.
In a flash, Jerry grabs the guy and VAMPS, ripping the family
man's NECK OUT.
CLOSE ON MINIVAN
As those "cute" stick figure family decals are splattered
with BLOOD.
AMY AND JANE
Now out of the car, react. JERRY IS A FUCKING VAMPIRE.
Jerry drops the business man, who's dead as he hits the
ground. He moves toward them.
Charlie looks at Amy and Jane. I told you so.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Yeah.
Charlie urgently grabs them. Shoves them down the highway.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Get out of here. Run. Run!
70.
AMY
BUT--
CHARLIE
Go! I'll catch up! She's hurt,
get out of here!
They back off.
Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it
as he walks toward Jerry. Jerry keeps his distance, taunting
HIM--
JERRY
Let them run. Just makes them
easier to kill when I'm done with
you.
Ding, ding, ding -- the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the
warning bell rings over and over...
CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry,
backing him off.
CHARLIE
I repel you with the power of
Christ the Lord.
JERRY
Do you? Really? When did you take
your last confession?
CHARLIE
Get back...
JERRY
That's a mighty big cross you have
there. Question is -- do you
actually know how to use it?
Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's
open car door.
But Jerry's on him -- hands BURNING as he rips the cross from
Charlie and shatters it with his hand.
Then he TOSSES Charlie, who flies and hits JANE'S CAR, then
crumples to the ground.
Jerry gets Charlie around the neck -- holds a sharp,
splintered end of the broken cross against Charlie's chest.
The wood still burns into Jerry's hand, but Jerry holds on.
71.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Ever take one of these in the
chest? I have.
Charlie struggles, terrified.
JERRY (CONT'D)
But they missed the heart.
Rigggght... . here. Easy
measurement.
Jerry positions the "stake" right over Charlie's heart.
Charlie winces. Terrified and overpowered.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Shouldn't have been so nosey.
Jerry's about to plunge the STAKE through Charlie's heart
when a THICK WOOD STAKE comes through Jerry's SHOULDER.
Jerry HOWLS, falls off Charlie and we see that he's been
staked by the business end of a REAL ESTATE SIGN.
JANE stands over them, quaking with fear and adrenaline.
Amy's right behind her with a CROWBAR.
JANE
Leave my kid alone.
Jane collapses, and we see that there's a lot of BLOOD on the
back of her head.
CHARLIE
Mom!
Jerry's in agony as he stumbles away, pulls the sign post out
of his shoulder.
Charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car.
Amy dives into the car with them.
Charlie presses the accelerator. Will it still drive?
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Come on come on come on...
IT LURCHES forward, then goes. Metal scraping the ground,
raining glass... but it RUNS.
They start to bolt when BAM! JERRY STANDS UP right in front
of the car, LUNGES AT THEM. CHARLIE RUNS OVER JERRY'S BODY
AGAIN. They speed off.
72
Jerry writhes in the middle of the road. But even as he
does, he HEALS. His body knitting itself back together...
A few minutes later. Charlie and Amy move out of Jane's
room.
AMY
The Peter Vincent?
CHARLIE
Under-whelming, believe me. But
he's what we've got.
They close Jane's door and we see that it's COVERED in
CROSSES of every shape and size. It's quite a spectacle.
A nurse passes, looks at Charlie and Amy quizzically.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
My mom is very religious.
ON JERRY'S HOUSE
LOOMING, silhouetted against early morning light. Next to
it, Charlie's house stands in charred ruins.
CHARLIE stands on the front lawn, contemplating the houses.
He wears fireproof clothes, has stakes and crosses strapped
to him, holsters made out of duct-tape...
Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister. And he holds
a crowbar in a free hand. He looks like something out of one
of Ed's graphic novels.
Before he enters, Charlie DOUSES HIMSELF IN HOLY WATER.
CHARLIE
Let's do this shit.
He swallows hard, scared but determined.
