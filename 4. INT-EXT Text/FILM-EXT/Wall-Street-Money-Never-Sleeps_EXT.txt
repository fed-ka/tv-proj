It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement.
A cab waits in the lot.
The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's
group of newly released emerge.
They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to
reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002.
Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel.
And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko.
But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have that
gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a
very different version of the man we remember... because now
there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read
anyway.
And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently
freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting
with the people who waited for them... the people who love
them.
The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... wait
a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot...
waiting for his people... but they don't come.
And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat...
completely disappointed... and completely alone.
And we...
SLAM BACK INTO
As the white letters reappear on the screen...
"As a result... the American economy collapsed...
Taken from an article about the pre-crash 1929...
... written by Alan Greenspan."
JACOB (V.O.)
It's funny, the more we find ourselves
slaves of chance... the more
superstitious we become.
2.
SLAM INTO: A MANHATTAN MORNING
A gorgeous June Friday.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And that would make Andrew Zabel one
superstitious motherfucker.
Find ANDREW ZABEL, mid 50s, shaved-head and in good shape.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He started every day the same exact
way. He would walk his dogs then
leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven
am on the dot.
As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East, an impressive
building made of white stone.
Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And he would take an umbrella with him
even when there was no chance of
rain...
As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the INDIAN CLERK a
familiar nod. And without saying a word, the clerk knows
exactly what to give him.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate
Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland
Springs water.
23RD ST SUBWAY STATION
As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate...
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He had timed it out so he wouldn't
have to wait more than three minutes
for the uptown five train.
As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight
from the 5 train coming down the tunnel.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I guess you could say that day was
like every other...
And as the train approaches... holding that Wall Street
Journal... the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids...
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Except for one thing...
... Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the
track.
3.
And as the train SLAMS into US...
DARKNESS
Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then...
"Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen... and we move down
below the letters to find...
A CHART
Now filling the screen. It's of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the
right... not good.
A circle marks Friday June 13th. Follow a blue line back
three days and stop. Another circle is now formed and
Matthew Good's "Giant" rings out...
CARD: JUNE 6th 2008... 8 DAYS EARLIER...
MIDTOWN
Opening titles... the workplace throng... listening to their
iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their
Starbucks.
Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the
opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers
building... with that giant ticker that rounds the building
posting Dow 12,579.76 -- +119.86
And keep moving... all is normal in the financial center of
the universe.
Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel
then climb up it to the top... to the penthouse office
suites.
And push in through the window to be in...
Jacob and Derivatives Trader enjoy the summer night. Out of
all the guys, he's closest to Jacob. His name is Robby.
JACOB
Can I ask you something, Robby?
Robby nods.
JACOB (CONT'D)
What's your number?
ROBBY
Huh?
JACOB
You know what I mean. The amount of
money you would need to fuck it all
and walk away... if you wanted to.
ROBBY
Do you want to walk away?
JACOB
Not now. But one day... I don't know.
When I have a family. It's just so
consuming... so many marriages get
FUCKED UP--
ROBBY
Wall Street divorce lawyers do great
in any market.
JACOB
Exactly.
(BEAT)
I've thought about it. What I would
need... to raise a family, live a good
life, be secure. It's not as much as
we would think if you move out of New
York.
And it dawns on Robby...
11.
ROBBY
Aha... when did you buy the ring?
Jacob smiles at his friend's perception.
JACOB
Last week.
ROBBY
So when are you going to ask her?
JACOB
I'm going to DC this weekend.
ROBBY
Good. I like her for you. She's one
of the good ones...
(BEAT)
Did you hear what her father said on
Charlie Rose?
Jacob shakes his head.
ROBBY (CONT'D)
Something about Bear Stearns being the
first rain drop of the impending
mother of all storms.
JACOB
Sour grapes.
ROBBY
He's speaking at Columbia on Friday.
If it's slow enough, a few of us might
play hookie and check it out... he's
the best show in town.
And they continue to walk, until...
JACOB
Tell me what you hear.
Robby slowly nods...
ROBBY
I don't think you want to hear it,
bro. You worship Zabel and it's not
good.
JACOB
I don't worship him. He's done a lot
for me and I've known him a long time.
But he's been acting strange lately.
(BEAT)
Just tell me what you hear.
ROBBY
That Keller Zabel is holding toxic
waste they can't find a market for.
12.
Jacob shakes his head...
JACOB
It's not true. It's rumors. There
are hedge funds with huge short
positions...
ROBBY
Jacob, you know better. You know it
doesn't matter if they're rumors or
not.
And Robby stops walking.
ROBBY (CONT'D)
Senior year I couldn't get my mind
around how all those dot coms with no
earnings were worth billions of
dollars and you were the one who said
something that made it all clear for
me.
JACOB
I don't remember.
Turning to Jacob with...
ROBBY
"An asset's value can only be priced
at its perception."
JACOB
I said that?
Robby confirms... then...
ROBBY
So buddy -- it don't matter if the
rumors are true or not. Because in
this climate... if they exist at
all... then most likely...
Looking his friend head on...
ROBBY (CONT'D)
... you're going to cease to.
Jacob leaves his Murray Hill building apartment and nods to
his doorman, DIEGO.
DIEGO
J to the Acob -- morning to you,
brother.
Jacob smiles...
JACOB
Diego...
13.
And Jacob waits for the morning joke.
DIEGO
Okay, what's the best aphrodisiac on
Wall Street?
JACOB
I don't know.
DIEGO
Jet fuel.
Diego cracks up. Jacob just shakes his head and moves on.
And Jacob walks uptown... deep in thought. It's a gorgeous
June Friday.
Suddenly, Jacob just stops walking and stands there for a
long moment... coming to a decision.
And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way...
As they enter through the gates of the park and walk...
14.
JACOB
Is everything okay?
And Andrew Zabel doesn't seem all there... introspective and
blank.
ZABEL
I remember when the starter gave me
this bushy hair twelve year old kid
and I said; "Donny, what the fuck --
give me a real caddy." And he said;
"This kid's the best."
JACOB
ANDY--
ZABEL
And you were. You had the wind down,
the grade of every green.
JACOB
What's going on?
ZABEL
But you wouldn't shut up about stocks.
Twelve years old and you blabbed on
and on about companies and sectors and
earnings.
JACOB
Andy, are we going under?
ZABEL
What was that piece of shit you loved?
That airline equipment supplier who
was branching out into car airbags--
JACOB
Flour Controls. Are you okay?
Zabel laughs.
ZABEL
Flour Controls... what a dog.
JACOB
Why did you give me that bonus?
Zabel stops walking and faces Jacob with...
ZABEL
Because I know you, Jacob. And I know
you've been holding off because you
didn't think you had enough. We all
do that... postpone life until we
believe we have what it takes to
actually live it.
15.
JACOB
There isn't a better money-runner on
the street... we'll get through this.
ZABEL
Marry her, Jacob. And have children
with her and spend as much time as you
can with them... and never forget that
that's what's important.
And Jacob L. Moore... looking his boss head on...
JACOB
Andrew, if there's anyway I can help --
give back the bonus -- whatever... all
you have to do is say the word.
And Zabel just looks away...
ZABEL
There's just so much you don't know,
Jacob.
Furious, Jacob walks down 6th ave with his phone to his ear.
16.
JACOB
Andrew, call me back. I'm going to
find out who did this to us. I swear
to God... if it's the last thing I do.
(BEAT)
We're going to bounce back from this.
And we're going to find out who spread
the rumor... and then we're going to
destroy them.
He disconnects the call and keeps walking.
After a beat, with his anger brewing... Jacob SLAMS his phone
down on the ground and it shatters.
As Jacob bounds the steps of the Business School and heads
into the old stone building.
18.
Gordon quickly walks out with his PUBLISHER, a woman in her
40s and heads into the quad. Jacob immediately matches their
stride.
JACOB
Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a
moment?
As he keeps walking...
GORDON GEKKO
You're too late, Sport... Q&A;'s over.
JACOB
My name is Jacob Moore and I'm dating
your daughter.
(AND THEN)
I'm going to ask her to marry me.
And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with...
22.
GORDON GEKKO
I'll give you nine minutes.
As Gordon and Jacob leave the campus and take to the street.
GORDON GEKKO
Keller, Zabel? Then you have my
apologies.
JACOB
Yeah...
GORDON GEKKO
Stock's in a free fall. My guess is
that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah...
Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and
checks to see Gordon's right... KZI... $12.54.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
By the end of the day it might not
even be potty trained.
And Jacob looks at him.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
I might not be allowed to trade, Jake,
but I still love to watch from home.
JACOB
Andrew Zabel took me under his wing
when I was in high school. He
basically got me my scholarship to
Yale then hired me right out of
business school.
GORDON GEKKO
Andrew's smart, he beats the
benchmarks consistently. He'll land
on his feet.
JACOB
He's dead.
And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob. Who confirms...
JACOB (CONT'D)
He killed himself this morning.
As that registers...
GORDON GEKKO
I'm sorry to hear that.
JACOB
He was a father to me.
23.
And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath
and looks into Gordon's eyes... genuine and lofty...
JACOB (CONT'D)
I love your daughter very much and I
would be honored if...
And realizing what this is... Gordon starts to laugh... which
throws Jacob off.
JACOB (CONT'D)
... you would bless-- I really don't
understand what you find so funny.
GORDON GEKKO
My daughter hasn't spoken to me for
eleven years and you know it. She
blames me for her brother's overdose
and every other disaster that's fallen
upon the world since the mid-nineties.
(BEAT)
And by the way, isn't it strange that
Winnie would date a guy from the
street?
JACOB
What?
GORDON GEKKO
She hates me. And she hates Wall
Street and everything it represents...
so don't you find it curious that she
would fall in love with you?
And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat.
Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
So you want my blessing?
JACOB
Yes.
GORDON GEKKO
I guess I should know a little about
you first. Where did you grow up?
JACOB
Matinecock.
GORDON GEKKO
I'm impressed.
JACOB
It wasn't like that. I mean we didn't
have much money. My mother was a
tailor.
24.
GORDON GEKKO
And your father... what did he do?
JACOB
Disappear.
And Gordon regards Jacob for a long moment, taking him in,
until...
GORDON GEKKO
Clever.
Jacob looks down the street.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
What are you looking for?
JACOB
Your town car.
With a laugh...
GORDON GEKKO
Well, pal...
As Gordon pats Jacob on the back...
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
... then you're going to be looking
for quite awhile.
... and heads for the subway.
A Victorian Estate on a bluff. Zabel's funeral in progress.
Hundreds of people made it out from the city. All types.
PRIEST
Andrew didn't have children, so he
made all you -- all of us -- his
children.
(BEAT)
And to list Andrew Zabel's many
accomplishments would take me far too
long to enumerate, but if you just
look around you, you'll see those
accomplishments in the faces of the
many people gathered here today.
And we pan the procession of mourners... past...
PRIEST (CONT'D)
The alumni of the Morris High School
class of 1997... who -- through the
adopt a grade program -- Andrew
pledged to pay the college educations
of every member who graduated and got
accepted into a University.
... past...
PRIEST (CONT'D)
The members of the Saint Helena
Symphony, who Andrew provided
emergency funding for when they were
facing extinction.
(BEAT)
And the many, many, other recipients
of Andrew Zabel's generosity.
... and past...
PRIEST (CONT'D)
Those who were left behind... those
who were overlooked... those who
otherwise would never have stood a
chance.
29.
And we land on Jacob L. Moore...
PRIEST (CONT'D)(O.S)
Above being just a great financial
mind... or a great husband...
He wears a dark suit... and a blank expression...
PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)
... or a great father... or a great
neighbor... or a great friend...
... with nothing but cold retribution in his eyes.
PRIEST (CONT'D) (O.S.)
... Andrew Zabel was a great man.
Jacob heads for the main house. He sees BARBARA ZABEL,
Andrew's wife, sitting next to the some friends.
Jacob slowly walks over and when she sees him... she
stands... wobbly and full of tears.
BARBARA
Jacob...
Jacob takes her into his embrace...
BARBARA (CONT'D)
(through her sobs)
You were a son to him...
Squeezing her tight... fighting back a rush of emotion.
31.
JACOB
I was a fucked up kid, I was angry, my
mother couldn't control me. He was
the only one who cared. I wouldn't be
anywhere right now if it wasn't for...
And Jacob Moore stops short... finally breaking down...
allowing his own tears to stream down his face.
He pulls away...
JACOB (CONT'D)
If you need anything.
She nods.
And Jacob moves away from the people and moves across the
lawn. But he stops when he sees a woman standing across the
way... we've seen pictures of her.
She's in her late-twenties with a natural beauty that might
take two glances to notice. But after that second glance...
it's unforgettable. She's WINNIE GEKKO.
As she rushes to him...
WINNIE
Jacob, I'm so sorry.
(BEAT)
Why didn't you tell me?
JACOB
Lehigh had the committee hearings and
I knew he would need you and I didn't
WANT TO--
WINNIE
That's not how this works.
And she looks into his eyes.
WINNIE (CONT'D)
Jacob, that's not how this works.
He nods. Regards her for a beat, then...
JACOB
Will you marry me?
WINNIE
What?
JACOB
I got a ring. Not on me, but--
WINNIE
Are you proposing to me at a funeral?
JACOB
Yeah.
32.
And then...
JACOB (CONT'D)
I had a whole thing I was going to do
in DC but seeing you... the words just
kind of fell out of my mouth... I
don't know.
WINNIE
He would've loved you doing this here.
Jacob agrees. And she softly kisses him and squeezes him
tight... tears in her eyes.
WINNIE (CONT'D)
Yes... I'll marry you, Jacob.
Hugging her back.
JACOB
By the way, I don't have a job
anymore.
WINNIE
Awesome.
AND THAT FUCK YOU RING
Glittering in all its glory. Pull back to be in...
JACOB'S APARTMENT
Winnie looks up from the ring.
WINNIE (CONT'D)
It's beautiful.
JACOB
Yeah...
WINNIE
It's too expensive. We'll return it.
JACOB
No.
WINNIE
Jacob I don't care about what ring you
give me. You know that.
JACOB
We're not taking it back. I worked
hard for that ring and I want you to
wear it.
She regards him... he's serious.
WINNIE
Okay.
33.
He moves to her... takes the ring and places it on her
finger.
Then Jacob pulls her into his kiss... it's almost violent.
She's taken off guard.
And as they fall into each other then back onto the bed...
Jacob gets off the train and sees her across the platform...
Winnie.
And as he brings her into his embrace...
As New York opens for business...
Jacob rounds West 62nd street and stares down the hottest new
address in Manhattan. A little nervous, he sucks in a deep
breath then heads into the building.
Jacob heads out of his building to be greeted by...
DIEGO
You know what I overheard a guy say
yesterday?
JACOB
I know you're going to tell me...
Diego smiles...
DIEGO
"This market's just like a divorce.
I've lost half my money... only I
still have my wife!"
As he goes into the hot summer day...
JACOB
Not bad...
45.
Jacob heads up to the restaurant to find Gordon Gekko waiting
outside.
GORDON GEKKO
There's a wait.
JACOB
Oh...
GORDON GEKKO
Fifteen minutes she said.
JACOB
Okay.
GORDON GEKKO
No, that's not okay. Because it means
they're crowded so every tier in the
service chain will be extended. The
sixteen minutes we would normally wait
to order will now be twenty six, the
standard twenty four minutes waiting
for our food to arrive will turn into
thirty nine, the eight minutes to get
the check will become seventeen and
the four minutes to process the credit
card will take nine.
(BEAT)
I told you I'd have lunch with you...
not give you a hundred and six minutes
of my time.
Jacob just stands there.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
Let's go to Whole Foods.
As they walk up Park Avenue...
GORDON GEKKO
So did you take my advice and not tell
your new fiance about our little
friendship.
Jacob doesn't say anything. And Gordon doesn't press.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
So, I'm guessing she's not going to
take your last name.
JACOB
Good guess.
GORDON GEKKO
That's my Winnie. I knew she was a
feminist when she was five and furious
that Mrs. Claus didn't get enough
credit.
And this makes Jacob smile... then...
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
My brother has two daughters. I had
Winnie and Rudy.
(sucking in a deep breath)
And since Rudy... you know... well,
I've worried about the name. It's
something you don't really think about
until you hit sixty or so but it's
important.
As they walk some more in silence, until...
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
I want you to get my daughter to
accept me back into her life again,
Jacob.
48.
Jacob slowly nods... not surprised.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
Because save for the extremely
precious and depreciating asset of
time... she's all I have.
As Gordon stops in front of a Georgian-style, pre-war
building and turns to Jacob...
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
C'mon, I'll show you some more
pictures of your fiancee that she
doesn't want you to see.
As Jacob walks... on the phone with...
ROBBY
Jacob, I could lose my job.
... who holds his sleeping infant in his hands.
JACOB
Robby, I need to know. Now nobody
moves size in this town without using
your desk.
(BEAT)
We'll play twenty questions only it'll
be two questions and all you have to
do is say "yes or no."
Capitulating with a sigh...
ROBBY
Fire away...
JACOB
Bretton Woods... The Locust Fund...
did they make any major moves in the
last few weeks?
ROBBY
Yes.
JACOB
Was it unloading Amlyn
pharmaceuticals?
ROBBY
(NERVOUS)
Jacob...
JACOB
Robby, I got you the fucking the job!
And after a long moment.
ROBBY
Yes.
Jacob stops walking... sucks in a deep breath...
JACOB
I'm sorry to make you do that.
With that, he disconnects and shakes his head in frustration.
And after a moment, Jacob sucks in a deep breath then makes
another call.
53.
JACOB (CONT'D)
(into the phone)
Okay Gordon... you've got yourself a
trade.
AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART
As a circle forms on June 19th then travels down the trend
line to early July and stops.
And as a circle is formed around July 4th, we...
CUT TO:
FIREWORKS
Exploding over the Capitol building.
A BBQ for the political set and their families. Paper plates
and plastic cups are being thrown away by HELP Children and
parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks.
Jacob holds Winnie as they look up at the sky...
WINNIE
My parents would always throw this
huge party in the Hamptons on the
fourth. The city of South Hampton
would have its firework show at 8pm
then my father would wait until it was
over then put on his... which, of
course, was always twice as
spectacular.
She leans up, sips her wine, then...
WINNIE (CONT'D)
Then one year the city passed an
ordinance that their firework show had
to be the last of the night... they
were sick of getting shown up by
Gordon Gekko.
Jacob laughs...
JACOB
What'd he do?
WINNIE
He rented a barge and shot the
fireworks off of it a mile off the
coast... out of jurisdiction.
(then... almost to herself)
The show was even more amazing over
the water.
And Jacob looks at her.
54.
JACOB
I think he should be invited to the
wedding.
WINNIE
No.
JACOB
Winnie, he's your father...
As the fireworks explode into their finale...
WINNIE
You don't know him.
JACOB
I know he's unhappy. Look at him out
there... trying to scare everybody.
He's desperate for attention.
WINNIE
This is none of your business.
JACOB
"That's not how this works."
Remember?
She just looks away...
JACOB (CONT'D)
He's got nothing.
The firework show ends and everyone applauds...
WINNIE
And that's what he deserves.
Suddenly, everyone begins to look over to the house where
something is happening...
WINNIE (CONT'D)
The things that came out after he was
convicted. The affairs... the things
he was recorded saying...
SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL, wearing ear pieces, start walking
the lawn.
WINNIE (CONT'D)
This wasn't the man we knew, Jacob.
It was... sociopathic.
She stands up and looks across the lawn to where all the
action is.
JACOB
It was a long time ago.
He stands and kisses her...
55.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Just consider it, okay? That's all
I'm asking.
She holds his look for a long moment, then... nodding over to
all the excitement...
WINNIE
C'mon, you can meet the next President
of the United States.
Jacob emerges from the Augusta and looks across the tarmac to
see a Boeing 727 with "The Locust Fund" written on the side.
And now Jacob knows why he needed his passport.
56.
As the 727 dives down toward Biggin Hill airfield... the
lights of London twinkling to the north.
The Black Maybach limousine pulls up out front of a 19,000-
square-foot Victorian home with the perfectly restored brick
exterior.
As Jacob gets out of the car and sizes down this incredible
home...
As the 727 takes off ...
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.)
You need to do something that will
earn his trust... you need to make
yourself a hero...
The most bizarre, stunning city in the world -- outlandish
skyscrapers, marinas, archipelagos...
And the 727 is now flying over...
THE WORLD OF ISLANDS
A collection of man-made islands that make out a one-
dimensional map-like depiction of Earth.
As we fly over this archipelago...
BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)
Richard Branson purchased Great
Britain, Rod Stewart bought Germany,
Tommy Lee bought Greece.
BECKER JETVAN LUXURY COACH
It's custom outfitted Mercedes-Benz van that's completely
decked out like the inside of a private jet. Full
entertainment system, recessed LED lighting, tray tables,
fine leather, blacked out windows that "defog" with the push
of a button, designed by Phillipe Starck and made custom for
$450,000 (once you get to the top of the waiting list.)
Jacob and Bretton ride into the city. Bretton takes a call
on his Vertu.
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE)
Yes... you have to be kidding me.
He disconnects the call with a mischievous smile and turns to
Jacob.
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
Looks like a bit of news broke while
we were in the air...
And Bretton turns on Fox Business to see footage of... The
Governor of New York standing at a podium next to his WIFE.
He doesn't look happy as he says...
GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)
The remorse I feel will always be with
me. Words cannot describe how
grateful I am for the love and
compassion they have shown me. From
those to whom much is given, much is
expected..
62.
Jacob's confused... Bretton's enjoying every second of
this...
BRETTON WOODS
He's been after us for years...
GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)
I have been given much -- the love of
my family, the faith and trust of the
people of New York, and the chance to
lead this state
Laughing with delight...
BRETTON WOODS
Oh Jacob... you don't want to live in
a glass house if you're gonna play
this game.
JACOB
I don't understand. Is he resigning?
BRETTON WOODS
Yes sir.
JACOB
What'd he do?
And Bretton simply turns to him and says...
BRETTON WOODS
Outsourced.
1,000-foot-tall feat of modern design, perched on the edge of
the Persian Gulf.
As the Jetvan pulls out front...
BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)
There's a big party for Oleg tonight
at a club called The Left Bank. It's
Roaring 20s themed so I've had
original suits from that era delivered
to our rooms.
Oleg and some of his crew lead Jacob, Bretton and three
beautiful, giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded
mooring.
Fishing boats bob violently in the water -- and next to them
is Oleg's Phoenix 1000, his personal, 65-meter SUBMARINE.
As a boatman helps them all climb aboard:
OLEG
Phoenix 1000.
The iconic charging bull of Wall Street.
JACOB (V.O.)
I think so.
Travel the park to find... Jacob and Gordon stopping at the
food vendors.
GORDON GEKKO
Well, I'm happy to help.
(AND THEN)
What about your end of the trade,
Sport?
JACOB
Oh... I'm still working on it.
(BEAT)
I'll talk to her. I promise.
GORDON GEKKO
(TO VENDOR)
Hot dog.
(TO JACOB)
What do you want?
JACOB
(TO VENDOR)
I'll take a pretzel.
As they get their food and walk...
GORDON GEKKO
So you're a hedge fund cowboy now?
Shaking his head...
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
Goddamn hedge funds -- what a racket.
Playing the world casino, betting
other people's money with leverage.
And it's completely legal and
completely unregulated.
(MORE)
71.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
The hustles they get away with make
insider trading seem like a parking
ticket.
SLAM INTO THE FRONTIER FUND/TRADING PIT
Rows and rows of computers in a large dark room....
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Nassim Tariq and his Frontier Fund.
With their slews of MIT grads who
become glorified millionaire robots
pushing buttons...
... with casually dressed ASIANS and INDIANS in their 20s
working the keyboards like zombies.
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
... slaves to top-secret propriety
elegant algorithms that work until
they don't.
AND SLAM INTO ESSEX CAPITAL ADVISERS/CONFERENCE ROOM
A stuffy conference room half-filled with bored MEN in their
40s watching a presentation...
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Or the baby cub funds like Sammy
Rosen's Essex Advisers... filled with
Goldman Sachs and Julian Robertson
pedigree.
Most of the men type on their blackberrys... one is actually
asleep.
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Men who are way too rich, lazy and
tired to run money properly anymore.
THEN SLAM INTO THE DANIELS ACTIVIST FUND/ALLAN DANIELS'S
OFFICE
A small cluttered office with papers strewn about...
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Or Allan Daniel's and his bully
operation.
ALLAN DANIELS, a small bull-dog of a man, paces back and
forth... dictating in anger. His SECRETARY types down every
word he's shouting.
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
... with his angry letters to company
boards that are nothing but veiled
threats in the name of activism.
AND RIGHT BACK TO BOWLING GREEN PARK
Where Gordon stops walking...
72.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
So you're inside... you have his
trust... and now you want to know
what's next.
And Jacob's look over to Gekko confirms this.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
Here's the thing about Bretton. He
puts all of his money into his own
fund which makes him stupid,
egotistical, and most importantly...
vulnerable.
(BEAT)
And he chases. He doesn't take losses
well and he chases with leverage. He
thinks he's a trader, he thinks he's
an investor but he's not. He's a
gambler.
Regarding Jacob...
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
That pretzel looks good.
Jacob just shrugs.
GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
Care to make a trade?
JACOB
Whatever.
And they trade. The hotdog for the pretzel.
GORDON GEKKO
As for your end of our trade.
(BEAT)
Find a way for me to reunite with my
daughter, Jake. Because we both know
how she would react to the fact that
you've been lying to her about bonding
with your future father-in-law.
Just standing there... holding that hot dog...
JACOB
Is that a threat?
Looking Jacob dead on...
GORDON GEKKO
Absolutely.
Jacob just shakes his head with a laugh... now realizing that
Gekko talked him into this position for this exact leverage.
JACOB
You're priceless, Gordon.
73.
With a smile...
GORDON GEKKO
Just be happy I'm on your team.
(AND THEN)
Get him into a bad position and watch
him chase it.
JACOB
What bad position?
GORDON GEKKO
What have I been saying all along,
Kid?
JACOB
Financials.
GORDON GEKKO
They're a death trap -- mark my words.
Holding his suitcase, Jacob emerges from the elevator and
heads for a waiting town car.
Jacob sees Diego...
JACOB
Bring it.
Diego smiles... loves this new one...
DIEGO
What's the most dangerous question on
Wall Street?
JACOB
Tell me.
DIEGO
"How are you?"
And Jacob agrees whole-heartedly as he heads on his way.
As the sun rises over our nation's capital.
Winnie and Jacob jog the park through the humid July haze.
It's very early.
And Jacob stops jogging. Catches his breath. She keeps
running.
JACOB
Why are you with me?
She stops and turns back to him.
WINNIE
What?
75.
JACOB
You hate finance. You hate Wall
Street. Why are you with me?
Winnie nods. It's a valid question. And she thinks about it
for a moment, then...
WINNIE
Repetition compulsion.
JACOB
Huh?
WINNIE
It's Freud.
JACOB
And what does it mean, psych major?
WINNIE
Well, it's when people repeat the same
dysfunctional relationships from
childhood in their adult life in hopes
of trying to master them.
JACOB
Like when children of alcoholics fall
in love with alcoholics.
WINNIE
Yeah.
He turns away... upset.
JACOB
That's great, Winnie.
WINNIE
Jacob, that might be why I was
initially attracted to you... but it's
not why I love you.
She moves to him.
WINNIE (CONT'D)
I love you because you're
compassionate and you care so deeply
about what you do and you have like no
ego, it's crazy.
She reaches to him... turning his face to meet hers.
WINNIE (CONT'D)
And you're the smartest person I've
ever met... and there's nobody I trust
more in the world.
Jacob looks away... almost ashamed. And Winnie can sense
something's not right.
76.
WINNIE (CONT'D)
What's wrong?
JACOB
Nothing...
As Jacob draws in a deep breath, collects himself and finally
turns back to her with...
JACOB (CONT'D)
I just wish you would master that
relationship from childhood so you can
move forward with this one.
AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART
As a circle forms on July 20th then travels down the trend
and stops.
And as a circle is formed around August 11th, we...
CUT TO:
And Manhattan... as it sweats through the heart of summer.
Two jetvans ride uptown...
2.7 million acres of State protected majestic land. All
nature... rivers and lakes... cypresses and maples. Clean
air. And trails. Many trails that go on for miles.
As the two Becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area, a
STATE RANGER opens the gate and allows them to drive through
then park.
Jacob and Bretton emerge from the jetvan.
BRETTON WOODS
This is how we do.
And with a nod, the DRIVER of the other jetvan opens it to
reveal two motorcycles inside. Bretton's MTT Turbine
Superbike and an Agusta, these bikes are handcrafted works of
art as much as they are demons of speed.
Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement.
JACOB
And we're allowed to ride these
through here?
Sucking in the fresh summer air...
BRETTON WOODS
No.
AND JACOB AND BRETTON
Now decked out in leather riding gear... on the bikes... at
the mouth of the trail... revving the engines...
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
Follow me...
And with that, shoots into the forest. Jacob quickly
follows.
AND THEY RIDE
Winding through the trees... along the side of a river...
Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up.
Bretton reaches a clearing and waits for Jacob to catch up.
Once he does...
BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
You're going to have to keep up.
JACOB
Okay. I'm just getting used to it.
78.
BRETTON WOODS
Tell me your idea.
JACOB
Here?
BRETTON WOODS
Where else?
JACOB
Right. Okay.
(COLLECTING HIMSELF)
Are you still short any of the
financials?
BRETTON WOODS
No. After KZI, I took profits.
JACOB
I think it's time to go the other way.
BRETTON WOODS
Banks?
JACOB
Insurance companies. I'm talking the
old school insurers that have become
the babies thrown out with the bath
water.
Jacob waits for a reaction from Bretton. But all he gets
is...
BRETTON WOODS
Keep up!
And with that, Bretton rips into the clearing. Jacob rides
just as fast. They're neck and neck... it's definitely a
race.
Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up.
As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only
narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and
revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton
as they approach the trail.
If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton,
he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't.
Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed,
narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling
ahead of Bretton and taking the lead.
A TRANQUIL LAKE
As it sits still in the setting sun. Untouched by man.
Bretton and Jacob get off the bikes and walk to the shore.
As they catch their breaths and enjoy the beauty...
79.
JACOB
The basket of stocks I'm putting
together focuses on reinsurance
brokering and management services for
businesses. They're trading below
book and have large dividends.
(BEAT)
I say we buy them here.
Bretton thinks about it. He's not sure.
BRETTON WOODS
Financials are a falling knife.
Jacob nods...
JACOB
I'm not arguing that... but the best
opportunities are found where angels
fear to tread.
Jacob can see... he has Bretton on the hook.
JACOB (CONT'D)
So yeah -- they are falling knives.
But Bretton...
And with confidence... driving it home...
JACOB (CONT'D)
... what's life without a little blood
on your hands?
A rainstorm takes over the city. A cab pulls out front of
Shun Lee Cafe.
Rushed, Jacob heads through the lobby of his building. Diego
catches his stride.
DIEGO
(doing his best Howard
COSELL)
Down goes Lehman! Down goes Lehman!
Down goes Lehman!
And Jacob just keeps walking...
93.
As Jacob jogs with our blogger from Streetaccount.com.
BLOGGER
It's so much better working out
outdoors... that gym was so stuffy.
JACOB
Not to mention expensive.
BLOGGER
Right.
JACOB
So, you've obviously heard the rumor?
And Blogger looks over to Jacob... he hasn't.
As the cab stops outside of the building...
102.
"Moral Hazard! Why Wall Street Has Finally Gone Too Far" is
now everywhere.
In large cut outs and piles on tables and in the store's
windows.
Jacob arrives at the end of the line... New York's newest
best selling author is having a book signing.
AND GORDON GEKKO
Signs a book and looks up at the LADY who gave it to him.
LADY
I have a question... what exactly is
"moral hazard?"
With a smile...
GORDON GEKKO
Short version -- taking risks you're
not accountable for with other
people's money.
And the next person steps up and hands Gordon a copy.
JACOB
He's going for it. We're almost home.
As he signs it...
GORDON GEKKO
There you go.
JACOB
But he needs fresh money to serve the
leverage. A hundred million.
Gordon just shrugs.
GORDON GEKKO
I'm a writer now. We don't make that
much.
As the line of people holding their new books start to get
impatient...
JACOB
I know that, but I figured you might
know how to get it.
Handing Jacob back the signed copy...
105.
GORDON GEKKO
Well, if you need money that badly,
Jake... you might want to check closer
to home.
Off Jacob's confused reaction...
As they walk the mall... the Nation's Capitol behind them...
WINNIE
It's a lot.
JACOB
How much?
WINNIE
I don't know, Jacob. I never really
considered it mine.
JACOB
But it is... right? It's your money?
And she faces him... regarding his urgency...
WINNIE
(glaring at him)
You might want to wipe some of the
drool off your face...
JACOB
I'm not kidding. This is important.
As they continue to walk...
WINNIE
Yes, it's mine. When he went to
prison, my father put a lot of money
in our names. And when Rudy died it
all became mine.
(BEAT)
But it's in a trust. I can't get to
it until I'm thirty-five and even then
I was planning on giving it to
charity.
JACOB
Let's say I can figure out a way for
you to get it. Take a loan against it
-- something like that. Will you do
that for me?
WINNIE
Why are you doing this, Jacob?
Jacob takes a moment... looking away with...
106.
JACOB
This is my only chance to make things
right, Winnie.
And she just regards him... not sure...
It's raining and gray.
