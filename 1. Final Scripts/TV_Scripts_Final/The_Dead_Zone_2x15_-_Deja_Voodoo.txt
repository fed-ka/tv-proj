  11*EXT. AVENUE GRILL RESTAURANT -NIGHT

          JOHNNY and BRUCE hop out of the Jeep, heading into a
          crowded restaurant.  Johnny hesitates.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Busy night.

                                        BRUCE
                        It'll be crowded everywhere. 
                        It's Friday. 


  22*INT. AVENUE GRILL - NIGHT

          Johnny and Bruce scope out the scene from in front of the
          lobster tank.  People are waiting and the bar is almost
          full.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: the bar)
                        I'm gonna grab us a seat.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll put our name in.

          Johnny crosses into the small bar, passing a VARIETY OF
            DRINKERS, including FOUR YOUNG PROFESSIONALS: a nondescript
          GUY ON THE PHONE talking to some girl, a tall BEER DRINKER,
          a short WINE DRINKER, and...

          A beautiful young white collar worker, NATALIE.  It's
          after seven, but she still looks crisp and professional.

          Luckily for Johnny, the only open stools are next to
          Natalie.  As he passes her on the way to sitting down, he
          brushes against her, TRIGGERING...


33A VISION - NIGHT EXTERIOR - NATALIE

          Starting TIGHT on LIPS, locked in a steamy kiss, RAMPING
          OUT to reveal: Natalie kissing someone passionately under
          a blinking streetlight.  As she surrenders herself
          completely to the moment, the VIEW SWEEPS AROUND HER
            revealing the someone she's kissing -- it's JOHNNY.

                                                                          VISION ENDS:          DEAD ZONE: D J  VOODOO - TEASER - 5/23/03 - BLUE       2.


  44JOHNNY

          Snaps out of it.  Finds himself back in the bar, just
          breaking contact with the girl.  He tries to hide his
          reaction as he settles in next to her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This seat taken?

          She smiles and shrugs, barely acknowledging Johnny, then
          turns back to her own thoughts.  With a curious smile on*
          his face, Johnny studies the object of his vision.  She's
          even more beautiful on closer examination. 

          Off Johnny's reaction...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

  55*INT. BAR - PICKING UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF - NIGHT

          Johnny is still checking out Natalie, unable to shake his
          vision of her kissing him.  But something's on her mind. 
          She's clearly with the other three, but she's not part of
          their conversation, instead lost in her own thoughts,
          staring at her wine, running her finger around the lip of
          her wine glass.  She pulls out of her reverie and picks
          up the wine, her elbow knocking her small purse off the
          bar.  She tries to catch it, but spills her wine in the
          process.

                                        NATALIE
                        Watch out.

          Johnny catches the purse, upside down and open, it's
          contents rescued in the palm of his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Got it.

          Natalie grabs his hand a split second later, and the two
          of them negotiate the spilled purse back up onto the bar. 

                                        NATALIE
                          Sorry...

          She helps Johnny drop the contents of her purse on the
          bar.  Usual stuff.  Keys, wallet, phone, and a small
          photograph of Natalie with some GUY, that doesn't
          register... yet.

                                        NATALIE
                        ...you okay?

          (NOTE: In all, they touch five separate times, once on
          each line of dialog, the last time on "yeah sure".)

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, sure. ...Let me get you
                        another...

          Their eyes meet, an indescribable spark of attraction
          passing between them in the pause before she answers...

                                        NATALIE
                        ...Merlot.

          But she quickly looks away, busy shoving her life back
          into the purse.  Johnny flags the bartender.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: D J  VOODOO - ACT ONE - 5/23/03 - BLUE      4.


    5CONTINUED:5

                                        JOHNNY
                        Another Merlot, and I'll have a
                        glass of the same.

                                        NATALIE
                        Thank you.  My mind is somewhere
                        else tonight.

          Johnny can't help staring at Natalie, and she can't help
            noticing.  Just then Bruce returns.

                                        BRUCE
                        C'mon, table's ready.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hang on, I gotta finish my drink.

                                        BRUCE
                        Bring it with, I'm starving.

          Johnny catches up with Bruce at the lobster tank.

                                        JOHNNY
                        See the woman sitting next to me?

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Had a vision of her kissing me.

                                        BRUCE
                        Really?

          Bruce checks her out.  He approves.

                                        BRUCE
                        I have visions like that all the
                        time, except mine don't come true.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Think I'll hang here for a while. 
                        Finish my drink.  Order me a bucket
                        of steamers and I'll catch up
                        with you in a sec...*

                                        BRUCE
                        ...or not.

          Off Bruce's encouraging look...


          JOHNNY AND NATALIE - A BEAT LATER

          As they try not to look at one another.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: D J  VOODOO - ACT ONE - 5/23/03 - BLUE      5.


  5CONTINUED: (2)5

          This time when Johnny catches her glancing his way, he
          dives in.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How's your Merlot?

                                        NATALIE
                        Nice.  ...it's no apple martini
                        but it will do...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You want a martini?

                                        NATALIE
                          No-no-no.  I'm a supervisor for
                        Manny, Moe, and Jack there.  I
                        have to set a good example. 
                          Besides, I have to get up early.*

          Johnny looks at her co-workers, two-and-a-half drinks
          into the evening.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So what do you do?*

                                        NATALIE
                        We're insurance adjusters.  New*
                        World Mutual.  Auditing a big*
                        industrial claim outside of town. 
                          ...exciting huh?  How bout you,
                        what do you do?

          Johnny hates this part.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm a... consultant...

                                        NATALIE
                        Really?  What kind of consulting?

          Johnny's on a slippery slope, and he knows it.

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...Futures.

                                        NATALIE
                          Futures?  What?  Like pork bellies?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... nothing like that...

          Just then her co-workers interrupt, oblivious to Johnny.

                                        SHORT WINE (BENTON)*
                        Hey boss... Bartender says there's
                        a great local band playing up the
                        street.  We're gonna check it
                        out.  You coming?

                                        TALL BEER (FOLEY)*
                        She's not going.  She never goes.

                                        NATALIE
                        I've still got paperwork to do.

                                        SHORT WINE (BENTON)*
                        That's why she's management...

                                        TALL BEER (FOLEY)*
                        ...and we're just a couple of*
                        drunken losers.

          Which suits them just fine.  They slap a high-five.*

                                        NATALIE
                                (dead pan)
                          Insurance adjusters gone wild.

          Johnny laughs.  Natalie notices.  Her co-workers push
          away from the bar.

                                        SHORT WINE (BENTON)*
                        We're outta here.

          The Guy on the phone stops talking long enough to check
          on Natalie.

                        Sure you don't want to go?

                        I'll walk back to the hotel.  Saw
                          a bookstore I want to check out.

                                        TALL BEER (FOLEY)*
                        Bookstore?  It's people like you
                        who give the insurance industry a
                        bad name.

          They start to leave.

                                        NATALIE
                        Hang on I'll walk out with you.

                                (turns to Johnny)
                        Thanks again.

                        No problem...

          Johnny watches her go, intrigued.  As she exits, Natalie
          glances back over her shoulder, giving Johnny a second
          look.  Always a good sign.


  66INT. RESTAURANT BOOTH - DUSK

          Johnny slides into the booth across from Bruce.*

                                        BRUCE
                        So?  What happened?

                        She left.

                        She left?  That's it?

                          She's... an insurance adjuster.

                        A damn cute insurance adjuster.
                        ...So what are you doing here?*

          Johnny shrugs it off and starts to shuck his clams.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Eating a bucket of clams.

                                        BRUCE
                        Listen Johnny.  I'm down with
                        using your powers for good.  But
                        once in a while it's okay to use
                        them for your own good.  Your
                        visions always come true.  If you
                        saw yourself kissing this woman,
                        then you know and I know, that's
                        what's going to happen...

                          Exactly.  And there's nothing I
                        can do that won't screw it up
                          somehow.  If I just sit here and
                        eat my clams, she will be back.

                                        BRUCE
                        Not necessarily.  You could be*
                          changing the future just by*
                          deciding to sit on your ass and*
                        do nothing.  Just the fact that*
                        you know she's going to kiss you*
                        changes everything.  The ball is*
                        already in play my man.  Time for*

                        of existentialism?*

          Bruce rips the bucket from in front of Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Gimme those clams.  You got a
                        woman to go kiss.


  6A6A*EXT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

          Johnny exits the restaurant just in time to see Natalie*
          saying goodnight to the Pep Boys as they go their separate*
          ways.  Natalie enters the bookstore and Johnny crosses*
          the street, following her.*


  77*INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

          Johnny enters a hip little independent bookstore and
            discovers a SMALL CROWD, all women, has gathered for a
          book signing.  In front of the crowd stands the man they
          all came to see...


          DR. LAWRENCE

          Author of the best selling book, "What Women Really Want"
          (subtitled: "The Woman Inside the Woman").  He's sincere. 
          He really knows how to listen.  He's a pompous ass.  We
          hate him on sight.

          He has a woman standing with him in front of the group. 
          She's crying softly, finishing up some kind of talk show
          like confession.

                        Haven't we all been there?

          Everyone nods empathetically.

                                        DR. LAWRENCE
                        In chapter seven of my book, I go
                        into greater detail about the
                        "inner" you and the "outer you"...


          JOHNNY*

          reacts to the doctor with bemusement, keeping a low profile*
          as he looks for Natalie.  Spotting her, he ignores the*
          book signing hub-bub and begins to shadow her from several*
          aisles over.


          NATALIE

          Looks at the stack of books surrounding a lifesize cut-
          out of Dr. Lawrence, dismisses it, and starts browsing.*


          SCANNING A ROW OF BOOKS

          All "Women Making Choices" themed: "Smart Women - Stupid
            Choices," "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Handling a*
            Breakup," etc.  Natalie flips through them, but can't*
          seem to concentrate on the contents, other things on her
          mind.


          JOHNNY AND NATALIE

          He's watching from behind the Dr. Lawrence cut-out as*
          Natalie flips through a book from the self help section. *
          She shuts the book and continues looking.  Uh-oh.  She's*
          coming his way.  Quick, do something before she sees you... *
          Johnny grabs the closest book to him, pretending to read*
          as Natalie discovers him.

                                        NATALIE
                        Hello there.

          Johnny looks up from his book, feigning surprise.*

                        Oh hey.  We meet again.

          She reacts to the book he's holding.*

                        Huh?

          Johnny doesn't know what she means at first, having
            forgotten the book he grabbed.  He follows her eyes to
          the book in his hand, "What Women Really Want."

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have no idea how that got in my

                        year old man telling me what I

          Behind them, the reading is over, Dr. Lawrence signing*
          books for the women in attendance while a waitress*

          Before she can answer, a familiar VOICE interrupts.*

          Johnny instantly recognizes the voice; it's DANA BRIGHT. 
          The sound of her triggers an attack of awkwardness for
          Johnny.  You don't have to be psychic to see these two
          have slept together.

                                        JOHNNY

          Johnny's busted.  Dana realizes she's blown his cover.

                        all it takes.

          Natalie looks at Johnny, a little suspicious.

                        Oh... how interesting.

                                        NATALIE
                        It can be. 

          Before Johnny can say anything, Dana grabs him by the arm
          and starts pulling him toward the book signing.

                                        DANA
                        Let's get your book signed.*

          Probably the last thing in the world Johnny wants to do.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No... Dana... I gotta...

          Dana waves Dr. Lawrence over as he finishes signing a*
          book for the crying woman.*

                                        DR. LAWRENCE*
                        Dana!  How was I tonight?

          He kisses Dana on the cheek.  We get the feeling their*
            relationship is more than professional.*

                                        DANA
                          Enlightening as always.  I want
                        you to meet your biggest fan...

          Johnny is horrified at being identified as such.  He looks*
          to Natalie, who gives him a sympathetic smile as she steps*
          back from the group, continuing her browsing.*

                                        DR. LAWRENCE
                                  (recognizing him)
                          ...Johnny Smith?  Well, I must
                        say this is a pleasant surprise.

          He puts out a hand to shake.  Johnny hesitates, looking
          back and forth between Dana and Dr. Lawrence -- he does
          not want to touch this guy and see Dana and the good doctor
          naked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  I don't shake hands...
                        it's not personal... you
                          understand...?

                                        DR. LAWRENCE
                                  (sincerely)
                        Of course.  Dana has spoken to me
                        about your troubles with intimacy.

          Dana coughs.  Johnny gives her a look.

                                        DR. LAWRENCE
                        Here, let me sign that for you.
                                (as he signs)
                        I think you'll find chapter nine
                        will resonate particularly well
                          considering your special "problem".

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...great...

                                        DR. LAWRENCE
                        I've taken the liberty of adding
                        my phone number, in case after
                          finishing the book you'd like to
                        discuss anything further.

          Johnny briefly considers killing Dr. Lawrence with his
          own book, then thinks better of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          JOHNNY

          reflexively catches the tray just as the waitress goes*
          down, averting disaster.  It's all done very smoothly,
          not slapsticky.

                                        DANA*

          Johnny hands her the tray as the waitress picks herself
          up.  Johnny looks back and sees Natalie is gone.*

                        Thanks for the book.  Gotta run.

          Johnny chucks the book back in the pile as he heads out
          the door.


  88EXT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

          Johnny dashes out of the store, looking both ways for
          Natalie.  He spots her up the street and gives chase.


  99MOVING WITH JOHNNY - EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          He tracks Natalie up the street.  She's a block ahead,
          window shopping.  As he follows her, he passes (but does*
          not notice) TWO MEN sitting in a car, one smoking, the
          other talking on the phone. *


  1010*EXT. TRAVEL AGENCY - NIGHT

          Natalie is looking at the window display of a Travel*
          Agency, the maps, posters, and ticket prices for exotic
            destinations beckoning to her. 


          NATALIE - REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW

          Lost in thought, she looks radiant in the glow of the
          travel display.  She notices Johnny approaching in the
          reflection.

                        I'm beginning to think you're

                        plan.  Don't even pack.  Buy
                          whatever I need when I get there.

                        Sounds great.

                        find out.

                                        NATALIE
                        Find out what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happens next.  After I kiss
                        you.

                        You really think I'm going to
                        kiss you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think so.  I know so. 

                                        NATALIE
                        And you saw this when you touched
                        me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw it, and I'm never wrong.*

                                        NATALIE
                        How do I know you're not just
                        making this up?

                                        JOHNNY*
                        You want proof? *

                        Wait a minute... hang on... see*
                        that street light?

                                        NATALIE
                        Yeah...

                                        JOHNNY
                        In the vision, while we were
                          kissing, it was blinking, like it
                        was about to burn out... but that
                        hasn't happened yet.

                                        NATALIE
                        So?

                                        JOHNNY
                        So when it does, you're going to
                        kiss me.

          Johnny steps closer -- and she lets him, curiosity getting
          the better of her.  Face to face, they both watch the
          streetlight out of the corner of their eyes.  A long beat
          passes.

                                        NATALIE
                        This is ridiculous.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait...

          Just then, the light flickers like summer lightning.*

          EXTREME ON NATALIE

          As the realization that something incredible is happening
          fills her eyes.  She turns from the light, to Johnny,
          their eyes locking.  She kisses him.  It's just a peck.*

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sweetly)
                        That's not what I saw.

          She doesn't need anymore convincing.  This time he kisses
          her... and she kisses back.  It's the soulful passionate
          kiss from the vision. 

          THEN SHE SLAPS HIM!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ow!  That I didn't see.

                                        NATALIE
                        I don't know why I did that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kiss me or slap me?

                                        NATALIE
                        Both... Did you see anything that
                        time?

          Before Johnny can answer, they are interrupted by...

                                        MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.


          WIDER VIEW REVEALS

          A MAN approaches Johnny and Natalie, catching them off
          guard.

                                        MAN
                        Sorry to interrupt.  You have the
                        time?

          Johnny checks his watch, wary of this guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  Nine thirty.*

                                        MAN
                        Thanks.  Now give me the watch.

          The man pulls a gun out of his windbreaker.

                        LOOK AT ME!

          Johnny and Natalie look down at the ground.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay.  Okay.  Be cool.  It's all
                          yours...

                                        MAN
                        ...the wallet too.
                                (turns gun on Natalie)
                        You.  The purse.  Now!

          Johnny and Natalie stay cool, hand everything over.  Johnny
          tries to sneak a glance.

                                        MAN
                        Don't look at me.

          Johnny complies, staring at the ground.


          JOHNNY'S POV - THE GROUND

          He notices the Man's shiny black work boots, glinting in
          the headlights of an approaching car.


          WIDER

          As a car pulls up, the Mugger shoves his loot into his
          jacket.  Then without warning, he calmly shoots Natalie
          point blank in the chest.  It's stunningly real, played
          very naturalistic, almost ordinary.  Johnny just has time
          to see her hit the ground before turning back to find the
          gun pointed at his face.


          JOHNNY'S POV

          As the night is obliterated by the muzzle blast.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

  1212BACK IN THE BAR

          As a startled Johnny finds himself back where the night
          started -- right after Johnny has caught the purse.

                        Got it.

          Natalie grabs his hand a split second later, and the two
          of them negotiate the spilled purse back up onto the bar. 

                                        NATALIE
                          Sorry...


          NATALIE

          Helps Johnny drop the contents of her purse on the bar. 
          Usual stuff.  Keys, wallet, phone, and a small photograph.*

                                        NATALIE
                        ... you okay?

          Johnny steadies himself, looking around to get his
            bearings.  He's just woken up from a nightmare to find
          everything is okay.  Except it wasn't a nightmare -- it
          was vision of his future.  He looks into Natalie's eyes,
            horrified to see there's not even an inkling of
            recognition.

          Off Johnny's reaction...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  1313INT. AT THE BAR - PICKING UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF

          The bartender is wiping up Natalie's drink, while Johnny
          puzzles over what to do next.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah... sure...  Let me get you
                        another drink... Apple Martini?

          Natalie registers mild surprise.  She hesitates, then...

                                        NATALIE
                        Sure.  Why not.  You must be
                          psychic.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So I've been told.

          Bruce returns.

                                        BRUCE
                        C'mon, table's ready.

          Johnny turns to Natalie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Save my seat?

          She shrugs yes, then turns back to her co-workers.  Johnny
          grabs Bruce urgently and hauls him out of earshot over by
          the lobster tank.

                                        BRUCE
                          Something wrong?

                        Yeah.  I just had the strangest*
                        vision.  It was like I lived a*

                        of it, only two seconds had gone*
                        by.  See the woman at the bar?*

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh yeah... I saw her.

                        They're having a book signing

                        That Doctor Larry guy.

                                        NATALIE
                        I hate that guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You and every man in America. 
                        Maybe we should go heckle him.

          Natalie laughs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here on business?

                                        NATALIE
                        Yeah.  We're Insurance adjusters. 
                          Auditing a big industrial claim
                        outside of town.  Exciting huh?

                        Never know.  Someone has to be*
                        there when bad things happen to*
                        good people.*

          Just then her friends interrupt, oblivious to Johnny.

                        Hey boss... Bartender says there's
                        a great local band playing up the
                        street.  We're gonna check it
                        out.  You coming?

                        I've still got paperwork to do.

          Which suits them just fine.  They slap a high-five.

                                        JOHNNY AND NATALIE
                                (together)
                          Insurance adjusters gone wild.

          Natalie cracks up.

                        Took the words right out of my

          If only she knew.  Her co-workers push away from the bar.

                        We're outta here.

          The guy on the phone stops talking long enough to check
          on Natalie.

                        Sure you don't want to go?

          Johnny watches them go, then scans the bar for Bruce, who
          is just flipping his cell phone shut.  He gives Johnny a
          thumbs up.

  1515INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

          Johnny pauses just inside the door, looking for Natalie
          who he sees in the self-help section.  Before she can see
          him, he dashes to the TRAVEL section, careful to avoid...


          DANA

          Standing at the back of the audience for the book reading,
          where Dr. Lawrence is doing his shtick, making the same
          poor Woman cry again.  Dana seems to sense someone passing
          behind her, but turns around too late to see Johnny.


          THE TRAVEL SECTION

          Johnny quickly scans down the row of books.  Finding what
          he's looking for, he grabs a couple of books, strikes a
          casual pose, and begins reading -- or at least pretending
          to.


          JOHNNY'S POV - NATALIE

          Natalie walks the row of psycho-babble tomes, occasionally
          looking for Johnny but not seeing him.


          NATALIE*

          Picks a book and starts reading, just as Johnny steps up
          behind her.

                        Hello again.

          She's startled, clutching two books to herself so Johnny
          can't see them.

                                        NATALIE

                        Travel books.  Thinking about
                        going on a trip.

                        I don't know.  Italy maybe.  I've
                        always wanted to see the Amalfi
                        Coast.

          Natalie is so taken aback, she drops her books.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here, let me help you.

                        It's okay, I've got it.

          But Johnny is there first, picking up her books.  Natalie
          cringes with embarrassment as he reads them.

                                        JOHNNY

          God she's beautiful.

                                        NATALIE
                        No... I am? ...must be the martini.

          She laughs shyly.  Johnny's thinking how great it would
          be to kiss her again. *

                          finishing the book you'd like to
                        discuss anything further.

          Johnny briefly considers killing Dr. Lawrence with his
          own book.*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          Johnny turns to look for Natalie, BUT SHE'S GONE!*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        I gotta go.*

          Johnny takes off in pursuit of Natalie, JUST AS THE*
          WAITRESS TRIPS...

          Except this time, Johnny doesn't save the day, letting a
          full tray of wine and hors d'oeuvres land on Dr. Lawrence. *


          DR. LAWRENCE*

          Covered in hors d'oeuvres.  It's a thing of beauty. 
          Blowing his sincere cover, he yells at the poor waitress.

                                        DR. LAWRENCE
                        You stupid IDIOT!  Look what you've
                        done...

          Everyone is horrified.  You could here a pin drop.  The*
          Oprah ladies start putting their books back.*          DEAD ZONE: D J  VOODOO - ACT TWO - 5/23/03 - BLUE     33.

  1818EXT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

          Johnny dashes outside, spots Natalie up the street,
          standing in front of the Travel Agency.  He calls to her...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Natalie!

          But she doesn't hear him.


          MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          As he starts moving fast up the street.  He doesn't get
          very far when something stops him cold.


          JOHNNY'S POV

          Halfway between himself and Natalie, he sees TWO MEN
          sitting in a car, one smoking, the other on the phone. 
          The man riding shotgun snaps his phone shut and gets out
          of the car.  Johnny instantly recognizes his shiny black
          work boots.


          JOHNNY

            Instinctively starts running toward Natalie, but only
          takes a few steps before he gets an idea.*

          reflection at the travel display -- except this time,
          instead of Johnny stepping into her reflection, the Mugger
          does.

                                        MUGGER
                        Excuse me Ma'am, do you have the
                        time?

          She turns to face him.

                                        NATALIE
                                (guarded)
                        No... sorry.

                                        MUGGER
                        That's okay, doesn't matter.

          He pulls out his gun.  Natalie freezes.  Headlights sweep
          across her terrified face as the Mugger's accomplice pulls
          up, screeching to a halt...

          But it's not the accomplice, it's Johnny.  He lays on the
          HORN.

          Caught in the blinding headlights, the Mugger pockets the
          gun and turns to run.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Get in!

          Natalie is still frozen, confused, a deer caught in the
          headlights.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's me.  Johnny Smith.  Get in
                        the car.

          Natalie is still frozen, when the STREETLIGHT behind her
          goes on the fritz.  It's just enough distraction to snap
          her out of her state of shock.

            Natalie's feet kick in before her brain does and she runs
          to the car, jumping in as Johnny steps on the gas.


  2020INT. CAR - MOVING

          Natalie grabs onto Johnny, looking out the back window at
          her attacker as they leave him behind.

                                        NATALIE
                          O-my-god-o-my-god he had a gun. 
                        He was going to shoot me.

                        I know.  Stay down.

          She ducks, then peeks back over the seat.

                                        NATALIE
                        ...He just jumped in a car...
                        THEY'RE FOLLOWING US.

                        Hang on.

          Johnny throws the wheel hard right, tossing Natalie into
          his lap.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Get your seatbelt on.

          She fights centrifugal force, trying to get back to her
            seatbelt, then Johnny throws the wheel hard left, tossing
          her back against the passenger door.  Finally she wrestles
          on her seat belt -- head spinning to look back at their
            pursuers.

                                        NATALIE
                        Things like this don't happen to
                        me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They do now.

          The Mugger's car falls just one turn behind.  Johnny,
          sees an opportunity ahead.  Kills his headlights and slams
          on the brakes.


  2121EXT. USED CAR LOT - NIGHT

          The Mugger's car burns around the corner and keeps going. 
          After a long beat, one of the cars on the lot comes to
          life --- Johnny's Jeep pulls out of the lot and off the
          curb, heading in the opposite direction of their pursuers.


  2222INT. CAR - NIGHT

          Natalie involuntarily grabs Johnny and shakes him with
          excitement.

                                        NATALIE
                        It worked!  It worked!  You did
                        it.  I can't believe it...

          Johnny steers with one hand, speed dialing his phone with
          the other.

          As the car stops, Natalie is just starting to come down*
          from her adrenaline rush.*

                                        NATALIE
                        So... that was... different.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Welcome to Cleaves Mills.  You
                        okay?

                                        NATALIE
                        I don't know.  I guess so.  I've
                        never been robbed before.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sheriff's on the way.  He's a
                        friend of mine... don't worry,
                        they'll get these guys.

          Their eyes meet.

                                        NATALIE
                        You saved my life.  Thank you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're welcome.  Just glad I caught
                        up with you in time.  I thought
                        you were going to wait for me.

          Natalie gives Johnny a long-long look, then starts shaking
          her head.

                                        NATALIE
                                (more to herself)

                        It's complicated.

          They've been drawn closer and closer together throughout
          this exchange.  A kiss seems imminent.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually there's something I need
                        to tell you...

          But before he can, headlights sweep across his face. 
          Johnny looks, eyes widening at what he sees.


          THE MUGGERS

          Shudder to a stop, pulling up alongside Johnny, window
          open, gun ready, drive-by style.

          The window explodes in a hail of gunfire.

          Johnny is snapped back to the bar, just as he and Natalie
            negotiate the contents her spilled purse back onto the
          countertop.

                                        NATALIE
                        Sorry.

          The glimmer of recognition is gone from her eyes.  Johnny
          notices the PHOTO OF NATALIE AND SOME GUY as she sweeps

          And she turns back to her co-workers.  Johnny opens his
          mouth to say something, then hesitates, not sure where to
          start.  Just then Bruce returns.

          She shrugs yes and turns away again.  Johnny pulls Bruce
          away from the bar.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't you want your drink?

          Johnny has just finished updating Bruce, who looks over
          Johnny's shoulder, trying to get a better look at Natalie.

                        I don't know.  All I know is I
                        touched her twice at that bar and
                        each time I had a vision of a
                        night with her that ends with us
                        getting killed.

                                        BRUCE

                        Conner.

                        What are you going to do?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Same thing I've been doing all
                        night, try to keep her from getting*
                        killed.  Except this time, we're
                        not leaving this bar.


  2828BACK AT THE BAR

          Johnny slides onto his stool next to Natalie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How's that apple martini?

                                        NATALIE
                        Too good.  Stop me if I order
                        another one.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here on business?

                                        NATALIE
                        Yeah.  We're insurance adjusters. 
                          Auditing a big industrial claim
                        outside of town... Exciting huh? 
                        ...and you, what do you do?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... how do I put this... I have
                        abilities.

                        Abilities?

          Johnny leans in and talks low, not wanting to be overheard
          by her co-workers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Psychic Abilities.  Now hang on,
                        before you tell me to get lost,
                        hear me out.  I see things...
                        when I touch someone...  I get
                          visions, mental images of their
                          lives... sometimes even their
                        futures...

                                        NATALIE
                        You're serious?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Completely.  ...I can see you
                        don't believe me.  Maybe this
                        will help.  Somebody has asked
                        you a very important question. 
                        Maybe the most important question
                        of your life... and you don't
                        know the answer yet.

          The VIEW HONES IN on Natalie's eyes as she realizes what
          he's talking about.

                                        NATALIE
                        How'd you know that?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I bumped into you a moment ago,
                        when you spilled your drink. 
                          Sometimes that's all it takes.

                                        NATALIE
                        I'm not sure I like this.  What
                        else do you think you know about
                        me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your name is Natalie Conner. 
                        You're allergic to dogs.  And
                        you've never been to the Amalfi
                        Coast.

          Natalie stares at Johnny for a beat in astonishment, then
          takes a big sip from her martini.

                                        NATALIE
                        Do you pick up a lot of women
                        this way?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's not why I'm telling you
                        this.  It's about something else
                        I saw when we touched.

                                        NATALIE
                                  (apprehensive)
                          ...yeah?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't go to the bookstore.

                        What?  How did you know... why
                        not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They um, don't have the book you
                        want. ...Anyway, it doesn't matter,
                        in a few seconds, you're co-workers
                        are going to invite you to a club
                        down the street.  When they do,
                        say no. 

                                        NATALIE
                        Why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because you're going to stay here
                        and shoot pool with me.

          Natalie refuses to give up her disbelief.

                                        NATALIE
                        You think so huh?

                                        JOHNNY*
                        Then they're going to say, "We're*
                        just a couple of drunken losers,"*
                        and slap a high five.*

          Just then her friends interrupt, oblivious to Johnny.

                                        SHORT WINE (BENTON)*
                        Hey boss... Bartender says there's
                        a great local band playing up the
                        street.  We're gonna check it
                        out.  You coming?

                        She's not going.  She never goes.*

          Natalie looks straight at Johnny, stunned, not sure what
          to make of all this.

                                        NATALIE*
                                  (haltingly)*
                        No... I've still got work to do.

                        That's why she's management...

                        ...and we're just a couple of
                        drunken losers.

          Which suits them just fine.  They slap a high-five.

          The GUY ON THE PHONE turns around.

                        Sure you don't want to come?

                        You guys go ahead.  I'll get myself
                        back to the hotel.

          The guys all groan as they move toward the door, Natalie
          hanging back with Johnny.

                                        NATALIE
                        So, you know all kinds of things
                        about me, but I don't even know
                        you're name.  I'm not psychic, I
                        have to find out the old fashioned
                        way.

                        Sorry.  Johnny Smith.

                        All right Johnny Smith.  You break.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


  28A28ARACK OF BALLS

          Breaking across the table.  The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL:

          Johnny and Natalie watch the balls scatter, but nothing
          drops.

                        There.  I spread them around for
                        ya.  Maybe we should bet a little
                        money, just to make it interesting.

                                        NATALIE
                        It's already interesting.

          Natalie sinks two balls in a row.*

                          I should warn you.  I grew up

                        Thanks for the warning.

          Natalie sinks another.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Would you miss already?

          She does, finally.

                        Thank you.

          Johnny lines up a shot.  Sinks it.  When he rises up from
          the table, Natalie is there next to him, leaning on her
          cue, something on her mind.

                                        NATALIE
                        When you told me before that
                        someone had asked me an important
                          question, what did you mean?

                        You know what I meant...*

                        I know.  But I want to hear it

                          Somebody asked you to marry him.

                        How do you know that?

                        You told it to me.

          Johnny takes another shot, leaving Natalie to wonder what
          the hell he's talking about.

                                        NATALIE
                        When?  Have we met before?

                        Not exactly.  I told you, I have
                          these...

                        That's probably a good thing.

          Natalie is a smart girl, she's starting to sense more is
          going on than she knows.

                        Two reasons.  First, I just wanted
                        to get to know you better.

                                        NATALIE
                        You seem to know me already. *
                        What was the second reason?*

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't tell you yet.

                        Why not?*

          Just then something behind Natalie draws Johnny's attention
          to the front door.


          JOHNNY'S POV

          Bruce ducks in from outside, looking worried, already on*
          the phone.  Making eye contact with Johnny, he nods toward*
          the exit door.


          NATALIE AND JOHNNY

          She turns around to see what Johnny is looking at.

                                        NATALIE
                        Isn't that a friend of yours?

          JOHNNY'S POV

          The two Muggers come into the restaurant, passing Bruce
          on their way in.  A HOSTESS leads them right past Johnny
          and Natalie, to a booth in the back.


          RESUME

          Natalie picks up that Johnny is reacting to the muggers.

                                        NATALIE
                        You know those guys or something?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was going to ask you the same
                        thing.

          Natalie looks at the Muggers who nonchalantly peruse their
          menus.

                                        NATALIE
                                (turning serious)
                        What's going on?

          Johnny thinks a beat.  Then leans in close and whispers
          to Natalie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The real reason I asked you to
                        stay is...

          And the rest of the scene is played on Natalie's face,
          Johnny's dialog buried by the bar ambiance and music. 
          But her face tells us everything -- including the exact
          moment she hears that two men are planning to kill her.

          Natalie suddenly begins backing away from Johnny, the
          horror of what is going on starting to sink in.  We can
          see the panic taking hold in her body as she begins
            instinctually to head for the front door, never taking
          her eyes off the two muggers.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Natalie, Natalie wait.  Don't go
                        out there... not yet... Natalie...

          But the urge to flee is too great for Natalie, and she
          turns and bolts for the door, Johnny following after her. 
          He throws a look to Bruce as he passes him on the way
          out.

          THE MUGGERS

          Watch all this over this over their menus, then start to
          get up.


  2929EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Johnny pursues Natalie out into the street.  She's freaking
          out, just like Bruce predicted.  She's on the verge of
          tears, terrified.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Natalie wait.  It's not safe.

          Natalie finally stops and turns back toward Johnny, letting
          him catch up.  Something she sees fills her eyes with
          terror.


            NATALIE'S POV

          Looking past Johnny, where the muggers are exiting the
          restaurant.  Bruce follows a beat later, calculating what*
          kind of move he could make.*


          JOHNNY

          Sees danger in Natalie's eyes and turns in time to see
          the Muggers crossing the street toward him and Natalie. 
          Johnny turns back to Natalie, wrapping himself around
          her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look out!

          The Muggers  make their move, reaching into their jackets,
          when suddenly, headlights sweep across them, freezing
          them in their tracks.  Car tires screech to a halt.  A
          siren WOOPS.  Police Flashers light up every shadow.


          WIDER VIEW --

          Several patrol cars have penned in the muggers, who are
          swarmed by Walt and SEVERAL DEPUTIES, guns drawn.*

                        Take your time.

          Natalie looks again, racking her brain.

                                        NATALIE
                        I'm sure.  I've never seen either
                        one of them before.

          Walt and Johnny exchange a look.

                                (shaken)

                        I'll drive you back to your hotel.

          Natalie looks at Johnny, still not sure just who this guy*
          is.*


  33A33A*EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

          Johnny's Jeep pulls up in the same spot as before.*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Of course.

          Johnny notices she's trembling, the evening's events*
          finally soaking in.  He reaches out and wraps his arms*
          around her.  She squeezes him tight.

  3838INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          As the door is banged open, they enter hot and heavy,
            careening their way into the room after Johnny kicks the
          door shut behind them. They fall back onto the couch,
          knocking some old room service dishes noisily onto the
          floor.

          Things develop quickly, both of them more than ready to
          take a chance on each other.  She rips open his shirt,
          he's tugging at her bra, just when it starts to get good...

          There's a KNOCK on the door.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Expecting somebody?

          Natalie shakes her head no.  More KNOCKING.  A muffled
          voice becomes discernable.  It's one of her co-workers,
          the PHONE MAN from the bar.  Call him STEMPLE.

                                        PHONE MAN/STEMPLE (O.S.)
                        Conner?  You in there?  It's me,
                          Stemple.  Just wanted to check
                        and see if you're okay.  We're*

                        in there, open up.

          She gets up and motions for Johnny to hide in the bathroom. 
          Reluctantly he gets up.


          AT THE FRONT DOOR

          Natalie unlocks the door, opening it a crack to reveal
          Stemple, who rushes in excitedly before she can say no.

                        But I told 'em, Natalie's a rock,
                        she's probably still up working...

                        Well, you know what they say, if
                        you want something done right, do
                        it yourself.

                                        NATALIE
                        What are you talking about?

                                        STEMPLE
                        You had to be so smart didn't
                        you?  You couldn't just send Foley
                        and Benton, two useful idiots...
                        no you had to come along yourself. 
                        Anybody else and I could have
                        covered my ass. 

                                        NATALIE
                        Please, Stemple, don't do this. 
                          Whatever it is you did, it's not
                        worth killing somebody...

                                        STEMPLE
                        Easy for you to say, you're not
                        the one who would be going to
                        jail. *

          He points the gun at her.

                                        STEMPLE
                        So, for the last time, where are
                        those files?


          JOHNNY MEANWHILE

          Has eased out of the door and is creeping up behind
          Stemple.


          NATALIE

          Frozen in terror, facing the gun.  Her eyes involuntarily
          dart toward Johnny.

          WIDER VIEW

          Stemple catches Natalie looking behind him.  HE turns,
          just in time to see Johnny diving at him.

          Johnny tackles Stemple, his momentum carrying them crashing
          to the ground, the gun knocked loose.  As they tussle,
          Natalie sees the gun, and starts moving toward it, but
          Stemple breaks free and beats her to it, shoving her aside.

          Stemple picks up the gun and starts to turn back, but
          Johnny is right on him, tackling him again, this time his
          momentum carrying them CRASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.


  4545EXT. HOTEL - JOHNNY AND STEMPLE - DAWN

          They crash through the window and hurtle toward the ground.


          JOHNNY'S POV

          The ground racing up to meet him.  Just as he makes
          contact...

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


  4646BACK IN THE BAR

          Johnny snaps forward, like waking up from a falling dream
          just before impact, his hands slapping against the bar as
          if to stop himself.  His eyes are wild, still very much
          in the heat of the fight.

                                        NATALIE
                        You okay?

          Johnny looks at her, groaning at the lack of recognition
          in her eyes.  Then he sees...


          STEMPLE

          Still talking on the phone, except now we know who he's
          talking to.  So does Johnny.


          MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          As he jumps off his barstool, pushing past Natalie and
          the other two Adjusters to get to Stemple, who he spins
          around to face him before, COLD-COCKING HIM with a single
          punch.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: D J  VOODOO - ACT FOUR - 5/23/03 - BLUE    54.

          Short Wine and Tall Beer try to grab Johnny, but he's
          still so amped from the fight, he shrugs them off like
          the hulk.  Bruce joins the fray, pulling Johnny free.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny what's going on?

          Johnny gives Natalie a look...

  4848*EXT. AVENUE GRILL - NIGHT

          In a repeat of the previous scene, the two muggers now
          sit in the back of one patrol car, while Stemple is loaded*
          into the back of another.  Walt looks on.  Natalie looks*
          at her would-be killers, a gobsmacked expression on her
          face.

                                        NATALIE

                        that fire claim you were auditing*
                        turns out to be arson, your*
                          "friend" had a few million dollars*

                        full statement from you in the
                          morning.

          Natalie turns to Johnny.

                                        NATALIE
                        You saved my life.  ...because of

  4949MONTAGE - COOL DANCE GROOVE MUSIC

          Johnny walks Natalie through the evening that never was
          but was --


  5050-- THE BAR

          sipping Martinis


  5151-- THE BOOKSTORE

          everyone gone - Johnny miming the waiter gag.


  5252-- THE LIGHTPOST

          He's kissing her, but just for story purposes, the instant
          the kiss breaks, he mimes the slap, then he's telling her*
          how they got robbed, his hand suddenly a gun.


  5353-- THE JEEP

          laughing as they sit in their spot in the used car lot,
          Johnny pointing out where the muggers drove by.


  5454-- THE POOL TABLE

          She's looking at the table, listening to Johnny tell the
          story of her beating him, as he points to the pockets she
          sunk shots into.  She is completely blown away by
          everything he's saying.


  54A54A*-- EXT. HOTEL

          He's showing her where he fell.*


  5555-- BACK AT THE HOTEL - THE MUSIC ENDING

          As Johnny shows Natalie where he crashed out the window
          with Stemple.

                                        NATALIE
                        You tackled Stemple and crashed
                        through this window?  For me?*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yup.

          Natalie studies Johnny.  Sexual gravity begins drawing
          them together, slowly.

                        What was that like?

          But Johnny can't answer, his lips are busy.


  5656THE BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

          They tumble onto the bed together, a jumble of skin and*
            inconvenient clothes.  A few quick cuts and most of the
          clothing is gone.

          Their hands sample unfamiliar territory, their eyes explore
          each other, finding only beauty.  They pause to catch*
          their breath, eyes locking, the calm before the storm. *
          Then he kisses her as their bodies melt into one another.*

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  5757*INT. BEDROOM - HOURS LATER - DAWN

          Johnny wakes up, finding himself alone in the tousled
          bed.  A sound slowly becomes discernable - NATALIE CRYING
          SOFTLY.

          Johnny pulls on some pants and follows the sound to the

    57CONTINUED:57

            bathroom, a slash of light spilling out of the cracked
          open door.  Inside, Natalie sits on the edge of the tub
          in her hotel robe, cell phone in one hand, the picture of
          her and her boyfriend in the other.  She wipes her eyes
          and blows her nose on the sleeve of her robe, pulling
          herself together for what she is about to do.  Taking a
          deep breath, she hits speed dial on the phone.

                                        NATALIE

          a DEAD ZONE WHOOSH ripping us back to...


  5858JOHNNY AT THE BAR (FORMERLY PART OF SCENE 47)

          The same stunned look in his eyes.  He verrrrry slowwwly
          lets his mind catch up with his body this time, getting
          his bearings.

                                        NATALIE
                        You okay?

          Johnny turns to look at her.  God she's beautiful, but
          this just isn't meant to be.

                                        JOHNNY

          front of him.

          Setting the picture back down with the rest of Natalie's
          life spilled out on the bar.  Johnny watches her as she
          sweeps everything back into her purse.

          A wry smile comes to his face as he realizes this just
          isn't meant to be.

          Their eyes meet.  His eyes full of recognition and a pang
          for what might have been... her eyes full of, "why is
          this guy staring at me like that?"

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell you in a minute.

          Johnny flips open his phone and speed dials Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sheriff Bannerman please...

          As he passes Stemple, Johnny gives him a Cheshire grin. 
          Still on the phone, Stemple nods back in acknowledgement.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Catch ya later pal.
                                (then into phone)
                        Yeah Walt?  Johnny.  Got a little
                          situation here...

          As they walk to the lobster tank, Johnny watches Natalie*
          back over his shoulder, knowing he's done the right thing,*
          but still wondering what might have been.*

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                          END ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
