                                          TEASER

      EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT11

      SUPER: Chicago, Illinois

      Sweeping shots of the Windy City take us to...

      INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT22

      Il Secundo.  A hip, high-end joint, think Ink or Lucques.  We 
      move through, to find: ENNIS ROTH and his girlfriend, TAMARA.  
      Both 21, and African-American.*

      The pair sit at a table, wearing their Sunday best (a suit; a 
          flattering-if-modest dress), and just finishing their meal. 
      Tamara leans back, taking in the AMBIANCE.

                                  TAMARA
                    This place is beautiful.

                                  ENNIS
                    It s alright.  You re beautiful.

      He s turning on the charm.  Cool and CONFIDENT.  Tamara *
      blushes-- then, playfully--

                                  TAMARA
                    Look, Roth, if you think laying it 
                    on thick like that s gonna get you 
                    somewhere tonight...

                        ENNISTAMARA
      I m right.You re totally right.

      The two share a SMILE, and Tamara s gotta ask--

                                  TAMARA
                    Okay, spill: why are we here?

                                  ENNIS
                    What?  I can t take my girl out for 
                    a nice meal?

                                  TAMARA
                    Ennis, for us?  A nice meal s an 
                    extra large at Lou Malnati s.  So?*




                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  2.

        CONTINUED:22

      As she speaks, Ennis glances past Tamara-- seeing the MAITRE *
      D  (40s, tux) nodding him over.*

                                  ENNIS*
                    So... hold that thought.*

      He flashes a smile, then his moving-- heading for the front *
      of the restaurant.  Tamara watches him go-- what s he up to?*

      INT. RESTAURANT - HALLWAY - NIGHT33*

      Ennis steps into a side hallway, meeting the maitre d .

                                  MAITRE D 
                    Mr. Roth, I hear it s a big night.

                                  ENNIS
                    The biggest.  *

      He holds up a (modest) ENGAGEMENT RING-- man with a plan.*

                                  ENNIS
                    Can you put this in a glass of *
                      champagne?  Something nice?*

                                  MAITRE D 
                          (bone dry)
                    Ah.  Yes.  How... unique.

                                  ENNIS*
                    A lot of people do that?*

                                  MAITRE D 
                    You d be the third this week. 

      Ennis frowns-- not what he wanted to hear-- as the maitre d  *
      BRIGHTENS.  Big smile.

      He s looking PAST Ennis, at the approaching SAUL HAYDEN.  28, *
      casually cool-- designer clothes, stylishly rumpled.  Saul s 
      with a friend, MARV (30s, think Joe Pesci).  *

      The maitre d  moves to the pair-- THRILLED to see them.*

                                  MAITRE D *
                    Saul, welcome back!*

                                  SAUL
                    You know I can t stay away.

      ON ENNIS.  Realizing: HE DOESN T EXIST ANYMORE.  An ANGRY *
      look flashes across Ennis s face.  He takes a step forward-- *
      can t believe this is happening right now...*


                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  3.

        CONTINUED:33

                                  ENNIS*
                    Dude-- we were just talking.*

      And SOMETHING CATCHES ENNIS S EYE.  He glances up, at the *
      CONVEX MIRROR hanging above... and sees a MONSTER.  Marv s 
      face is TWISTED AND GROTESQUE.  Ennis JOLTS BACK in surprise--

      And all eyes are on him.  Marv (looking NORMAL) scowls.

                                  MARV
                    You got a problem?

      Ennis eyes the MIRROR-- but only the BACK of Marv s head is 
      visible (and NORMAL).  Ennis blinks-- is he SEEING THINGS?  

                                  SAUL
                    Marv, chill.*
                          (then, to Ennis)*
                    It s all good, yeah?*

                                  ENNIS
                    I... yeah.

      Saul smiles, as the maitre d  steps in-- nods to he and Marv.*

                                  MAITRE D 
                    This way, gentlemen.

      He leads the two down the hall.  Ennis takes a beat-- that *
      was weird-- then shoves HIS RING into his pocket, and turns--*

      Just in time to see an OLDER WOMAN fishing a RING from her *
      glass of bubbly in the dining room.  People ooh and aah.  

      OFF ENNIS-- sonuvabitch-- we CUT TO--*

      The MAITRE D , as he leads SAUL and Marv around a CORNER... 
      to find an  Employees Only  door.  With six locks.  Odd.  The *
      man starts to key them open, as we CUT TO--

      INT. RESTAURANT - BACKROOM - NIGHT44

      A different kind of restaurant.  Steel tables, floors dotted 
      with drainage grates.  Half slaughterhouse, half DIVE BAR.  

      Saul and Marv enter, as a WAITRESS passes.  Saul flirts--

                                  SAUL
                    Mindy.  You miss me?

                                  WAITRESS
                          (with a pout)
                    Aw.  I liked you as a blonde.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  4.

        CONTINUED:44

      She moves off, and Saul nods-- okay then.  He casually 
      reaches up, runs a hand through his hair... and it changes 
      from BLACK TO BLONDE.  Saul s a SHAPESHIFTER. 

      Saul and Marv head for the BAR, and as they move we clock 
      OTHER MONSTERS: a tattooed DJINN, a woman with CAT S EYES.

      Saul passes a man with his arm around a WOOZY REDHEAD.  The 
      dude smiles-- and his mouth is full of SHARK-LIKE FANGS!  
      He s a VAMPIRE!  The man BITES the girl s throat-- FEEDING.  

      Marv and Saul hit the BAR, where the WAITRESS is snipping 
      open a bag of B+.  Mixing up a bloody Bloody Mary.  Saul 
      catches her eye, pointing to his new blonde hair.

                                  SAUL
                    Better?  I hear they have more fun.

      Before she can respond-- a MAN looms up beside.  Meet JULIAN 
      DURANT, 29, savagely handsome.  Marv shifts back, uneasy, and 
      without even looking up, Saul knows who s there--

                                  SAUL
                    Julian.  I m not lookin  for *
                    trouble, okay?  I just want a *
                    drink.*

      Julian smirks, peels a TWENTY from a billfold, and tosses it *
      on the bar.  *

                                  JULIAN
                    Then go buy yourself a bottle, and *
                    drink it on the street.  With the *
                    rest of the shifter scum.  

      Saul doesn t even look at the money, just SNORTS, then turns *
      his back.   Fuck off .  But Julian s not done.*

                                    JULIAN*
                    I wasn t asking.

      And there s a THREAT in his voice.  Saul glances back.*

                                  SAUL
                    I don t care.  You werewolves think 
                    you re special-- but you re just 
                    sons of bitches.  

      Marv barks out a LAUGH-- WHAM!  And Julian BACKHANDS him, 
      sending Marv crashing to the floor.  Saul wheels on Julian--

      Who FLASHES FANGS!  JUMP SCARE!  Julian LUNGES, but Saul s 
      FAST-- he grabs Julian s THROAT, SLAMMING his head to the bar!


                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  5.

      CONTINUED: (2)44

      Julian recovers, SNARLING-- and MARV and the DJINN are between 
      them.  Marv holds Saul back, as Julian shifts to HUMAN-- 

                                  SAUL
                    That all you got?!

                                  JULIAN
                    Oh, I got more.*

      Then-- Julian s phone CHIMES.  He pulls it out, reading a 
      TEXT.  Julian gives a DARK CHUCKLE--

                                    JULIAN*
                    A lot more.*

      And he HEADS FOR THE DOOR.  Saul s SURPRISED-- the Hell?*

                                  SAUL
                    Where you goin , Old Yeller?

      Julian responds with a SMIRK as he EXITS.  OFF SAUL-- uneasy--

      EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT55

      ENNIS and TAMARA leave-- he s holding her hand, pulling her 
      forward.  EXCITED.  Ennis has got an IDEA.

                                  TAMARA
                    Ennis-- where are we going?*

                                  ENNIS
                    That place wasn t us.

      INT. RESTAURANT - BACKROOM - NIGHT66*

      The WAITRESS pours Saul a shot-- now it s her turn to flirt. 

                                  WAITRESS
                    On the house, tough guy.

      INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT77

      CLOSE ON: A BREAKER BOX, as- a CLAWED HAND RIPS IT OPEN-- *

      INT. RESTAURANT - BACKROOM - NIGHT88

      And the LIGHTS GO OUT.  The monsters quiet.  Sensing TROUBLE.  
      Our waitress tests the air with a FORKED TONGUE, as--

      BANG!  A STORAGE ROOM flies open, and a FIGURE bursts out!  *





                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  6.

        CONTINUED:88

      In the DARKNESS we can barely make it out: humanoid, hunched, 
      and FACE HOODED.  Hidden in SHADOWS.  Think the NAZGUL from 
      Lord of the Rings.  Thing turns, and we CUT TO--*

      MONSTER POV:  Tinted GREEN.  Focusing on SAUL.*

      And it s CHAOS, as THE FIGURE cuts a swath of DEATH through 
      the room.  Coming for Saul.  Gutting anything in its way.

      Saul tries to move... but the thing is TOO QUICK.  BAM!  It  
      barrels into him, sending Saul crashing into a table.

      ON SAUL.  On the ground.  He opens his eyes-- to see MARV 
      lying nearby.  His THROAT SHREDDED.

      Saul JERKS UP-- and WINCES.  Three deep GASHES crisscross his 
      side.  Leaking blood.  It got him.  Fuck... CUT TO--

      EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT99

      Ennis and Tamara.  At a BUS STOP near the restaurant.  He s 
      jazzed, she s confused.

                                  TAMARA
                    So you dragged me to a bus stop... *
                    why?*

                                  ENNIS
                    We met at a bus stop.  First day of *
                    fifth grade-- you had your hair in *
                    braids, and I couldn t take my eyes *
                    off you.*

      Tamara MELTS at that.  Aw.  Ennis looks her in the eye.  *

                                  ENNIS
                    Tam, I don t wanna do this the same *
                    cheesy way everyone else does, and-- *
                    this is us.  So...

      He goes for the RING-- and Tamara realizes what s happening.  
      She puts her hands over her mouth.  TEARS welling up. 

                                  TAMARA
                      Ohmigod...

      This is IT--

      BANG!  A sound from the DARK ALLEY behind.  A door slamming.  

      Ennis looks up-- to see SAUL burst from the darkness!  Tamara 
      SCREAMS, as Saul stumbles to the pavement in front of them. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  7.

        CONTINUED:99

                                  ENNIS
                    Call 911!

      Tamara goes for her phone, as Ennis kneels next to Saul, whose 
      eyes are hollow-- voice cracking-- staring up at Ennis--

                                  SAUL
                    David... I m so sorry...

                                  ENNIS
                    David?  Who s David?

      BANG!  Another sound.  TAMARA whips around-- to see a DARK *
      SHAPE sprinting through the shadows. *

      MONSTER POV:  Locked in on Saul.  Closing FAST-- Tamara s  *
      BETWEEN the predator and its prey!

      Tamara SCREAMS and Ennis whips around, as-- BAM!  The FIGURE *
      THROWS Tamara aside.  She hits the wall with a WET CRUNCH--*

      And Ennis is moving-- charging the thing-- *

                                  ENNIS*
                    Tamara!*

      The figure wheels, slashing at Ennis with its claws-- *
      SHREDDING HIS JACKET and knocking him to the ground.  Hard.*

      ON ENNIS.  On the pavement.  Ears ringing.  Vision blurred.  *
      He looks left to see--*

      The FIGURE crouched over Saul.  It raises a hand tipped with *
      SILVER CLAWS... and PUNCHES THROUGH THE SHIFTER S CHEST!  *

      The thing rips its hand back, DROPS Saul s CORPSE to the *
      ground, and turns-- VANISHING into the dark alley, as--*

      Ennis stumbles to his feet, moving for TAMARA...*

      Who lays against the wall.  A smear of RED staining the brick *
      behind her head.  Jaw slack.  Eyes lifeless.  Ennis reaches *
      out.  Touching her face.  Begging...

                                  ENNIS
                    No... please no... no!

      But Tamara s DEAD.  And OFF ENNIS-- his world ripped apart--

                                                                          BLACKOUT.

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY1010

      Ennis sits at a bare table.  It s just hours after Tamara s 
      death, and while Ennis seems focused on the outside-- on the 
      inside he s RAGING.  Fighting to control his GRIEF and ANGER. *
      As we ll learn, Ennis has a TEMPER.  *

                                  ENNIS
                    I know what I saw.

      DETECTIVE FREDDIE COSTA (41, loosened tie, world weary), sits 
      across from Ennis.  Taking his statement.

                                  COSTA
                    And you re sure-- I mean sure?  
                     Cause, what you re tellin  me?  
                    About this faceless whatever-it-is? 
                          (beat, sympathetic)
                    Look, maybe you got confused.  Maybe 
                    it was some banger, with a knife.

      And Ennis SNAPS-- hitting the table.  *

                                  ENNIS
                    I know what I saw.

                                  COSTA
                    Hey.  Settle.  I m tryin  to help.

                                  ENNIS
                    By calling me a liar?

                                  COSTA*
                    By keepin  you from doin  somethin  
                    stupid.  I seen that look before--*
                          (pointed)
                    And the last time?  It got you 
                    three nights in Juvie.

                                  ENNIS
                     Cause I did the right thing.

                                  COSTA
                    You broke your neighbor s leg, Ennis.

                                  ENNIS
                    He was beating the crap out of his 
                    wife, Freddie!*

      Costa sighs-- rubbing his face.*



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  9.

      CONTINUED:1010

                                  COSTA*
                    You re just like your old man.  He *
                    was a stubborn S.O.B. too.*

                                  ENNIS*
                    It s what made him a good cop.*

      A SHADOW passes over Costa s face-- clearly he has is own *
      opinions on that-- but the detective plays nice.*

                                  COSTA*
                    Look, your dad taught me everything *
                    I know.  But his temper never did *
                    him any favors.*
                          (then)*
                    Ennis-- you had a tough shake, *
                    losin  your parents as young as you *
                    did.  And I ve done what I can for *
                    you, but this...*

      He takes a beat-- softening.  Feeling for Ennis.*

                                  COSTA
                    Tamara was a great girl.  And she d *
                    want you to stick to the plan.  *
                    Hell, you start the Police Academy *
                    in a month-- like your old man *
                    always wanted...*
                          (off Ennis)
                    But if you go off half-cocked, *
                    spouting this monster crap-- or 
                    doing somethin  stupid...

                                  ENNIS*
                          (beat)*
                    I know what I saw.

      Ennis is HOLDING FIRM.  Costa sags, as the door opens---*

      And SAM and DEAN WINCHESTER enter.  In their FED SUITS.*

                                  DEAN
                    Bonham and Peart, FBI.  We ll take *
                    it from here.*

      Costa rises and moves to the boys.  Annoyed.  Sotto--*

                                  COSTA
                    The Hell you will.  Since when does *
                    the Feeb work stabbings?  Shouldn t *
                    you be out lookin  for New Osama?*

      Dean puts an arm around the cop, gently guiding him forward.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  10.

                                  DEAN
                    Listen, detective, I can t really 
                    go into detail, but... let s just 
                    say your perp fits a profile.

      Costa starts to reply, and realizes: he s been maneuvered OUT 
      THE DOOR.  Dean smiles... and CLOSES IT.  Our boys turn to 
      Ennis, who stares-- who are these guys?

                                  DEAN
                    Okay-- let s talk about last night.

                                  ENNIS
                    Why?  So you can call me crazy too?

                                  SAM
                    Try us.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER1111

      Ennis is finishing his story.  Voice cracking with EMOTION.

                                  ENNIS
                    ...and when I got to her, she... *

      His voice trails off-- and Sam FEELS for the kid.  *

                                  SAM
                    There s nothing you could ve done.

                                  ENNIS
                    That supposed to make me feel better?*

      Sam looks away-- no answer for that.  Ennis leans in.*

                                  ENNIS*
                    That thing-- it wasn t human.  *
                    Someone has to do something.*

      Sam and Dean trade a look, then--*

                                  DEAN
                    Don t know what to tell you, kid. *
                    No such thing as monsters.*

      OFF ENNIS.  Frustrated.  And realizing that, as usual, he ll *
      have to take care of this HIMSELF.

      EXT. CAMPUS - DAY1212

      Loyola University in Chicago.  Nice day.  To establish.      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  11.


      INT. OFFICE - DAY1313

      CLOSE ON: A DOOR.   W.L. Graham - Mathematics Department 
      Chair   stencilled across it.  It OPENS, and we ENTER--

      A college OFFICE.  A HOT T.A. (20s) sits at a desk in front 
      of a second door, to an INNER OFFICE.  She looks up, 
      startled, as PROFESSOR GRAHAM (50s, a winter hat) enters.

                                  HOT T.A.
                      Professor?  What are you doing here?

      Graham pauses-- surprised to see her, but rolling with it.

                                  GRAHAM
                    My office.  Why aren t you at lunch?

                                  HOT T.A.
                      Paperwork.  I thought you and your 
                    wife had gone away for the weekend.

                                  GRAHAM
                    We have-- we are.  I just forgot 
                      something.  Don t worry about it.

      He flashes a tense smile, then he s past her.  Graham steps 
      into the INNER OFFICE, closes the door behind him--

      BZZT!  And his PHONE CHIMES.  Graham checks the caller ID: 
       Home .  He frowns-- sends it to VOICEMAIL-- and then...

      Graham snaps a FLASH DRIVE into the room s computer, clicks 
      on the  Spring Finals  folder-- and starts to COPY IT--

      As the machine churns, Graham turns-- and MORPHS INTO DAVID 
      HAYDEN (22, lean, with intelligent eyes).  Like his brother, 
      David s a SHAPESHIFTER.  He dials a PHONE--

                                  DAVID
                    Matt, it s David Hayden.  Spread *
                    the word: I ve got answers to every 
                    math final.  Fifty bucks a pop.*

      A NOISE BEHIND.  David lowers the phone, turns-- and he LOOKS *
      LIKE GRAHAM again.  The T.A. stands in the door.*

                                  HOT T.A.*
                    I know why you re really here.

        David/Graham goes cold-- uh-oh-- as she moves close.  Then...

                                  HOT T.A.
                    You came to say goodbye.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  12.

      CONTINUED:1313

      And she KISSES HIM!  David reacts with SURPRISE.  Pulls back.  

                                  DAVID/GRAHAM
                    Whoa-- whoa.  We re-- really?

                                  HOT T.A.
                    I want you to destroy me.

      David eyes the computer.  The folder s copying: 84%... 85%... 

                                  DAVID/GRAHAM
                    Okay, that s... wow.  Uh, listen... 
                    it s over.
                          (off the TA)*
                    I m old, and married, and... old.  *
                    So, so old.  But you re young, and 
                    hot, and... you can do better.  So, 
                    we should both move on.  Like, now.

      As he speaks, David steps around, so he s blocking the 
      computer... and grabs the FLASH DRIVE, just as it hits 100%.  

                                  DAVID/GRAHAM
                    But hey, you ll be fine, and--
                          (lightbulb)
                    I ve got a student you should meet: 
                    David Hayden.  Great guy.

      EXT. CAMPUS - DAY1414

      DAVID (in his NORMAL FORM) walks across the quad.  BZZT!  His *
      PHONE.   Home  again.  David answers-- annoyed--

                                  DAVID
                    Yeah?
                          (beat, going pale)
                    Margo-- slow down.  What do you 
                    mean?  What about Saul?

      EXT. ROWHOUSE - NIGHT1515

      ENNIS moves down the sidewalk, in Chicago s Englewood *
      neighborhood.  Past cramped rowhouses-- junkies-- dealers.  *

      Englewood has a 40% poverty rate, and 881 violent crimes a *
      year.  This is where Ennis grew up-- what shaped him.  *

      INT. ROWHOUSE - ENNIS S ROOM - NIGHT1616*

      Spare, simple.  ENNIS enters, beelining for his DESK, pulling *
      out a FLASHLIGHT.  Then--*




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  13.

      CONTINUED:1616

      He opens the CLOSET, digging out a FOOTLOCKER marked  N. *
      Roth .  Ennis pops the top, and sees a collection of HIS *
      FATHER S THINGS: 

      A picture of OFFICER NATE ROTH (50s) in his uniform, framed *
      MEDALS, commendations, the MEMORIAL FLAG from his funeral.  

      Ennis reaches in, grabbing: a FLASHLIGHT, a LOCK PICK GUN-- 

      And his father s SERVICE REVOLVER.  As Ennis lifts the weapon 
      from its case, the foam holding it in place pops out-- and 
      something CLATTERS to the floor.

      Ennis bends low, picking up a SILVER BULLET, its casing laced *
      with strange RUNES.  Ennis stares, no idea what it means--*

      But it s our first clue that his father knew something about 
      the SUPERNATURAL.  At the very least, he knew how to KILL IT.

      EXT. HAYDEN HOUSE - NIGHT1717

        A MOTORCYCLE pulls up in front of an upper-middle-class 
      TOWNHOUSE, and... DAVID takes off his helmet.  *

      INT. HAYDEN HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT1818*

      David steps inside, and scans the place.  Nobody s home.*

      INT. HAYDEN HOUSE - DAVID & SAUL S ROOM - NIGHT1919*

      David enters.  This is the room he used to share with his *
      brother-- and it s a time capsule of their childhood.  *
      Perfectly preserved since David moved out at 18:*

      Two beds, some posters (cars, hot chicks, Lil Wayne, Eminem), *
      and a WALL OF PHOTOS.  Pictures of the HAYDENS through the *
      years: Saul, David, MARGO, their FATHER and MOTHER.*

      DAVID scans them, then turns-- and clocks a BASKETBALL *
      sitting in the corner.  He picks it up, and we FLASHBACK TO--*

      EXT. HAYDEN HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK2020*

      Three quick, 8MM MEMORIES:*

      - YOUNG DAVID (6, we saw him in the PHOTOS) and YOUNG SAUL *
      (13, ditto) playing hoops on a portable basket.  *

      - The kids messily eating ice cream.  Laughing and grinning.*

      - David sitting on the stoop.  Saul next to him-- one arm *
      draped protectively over his younger brother.*      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  14.


      INT. HAYDEN HOUSE - DAVID & SAUL S ROOM - NIGHT - RESUME2121*

      ON DAVID.  Reliving those great old days...*

      INT. HAYDEN HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT2222*

      David steps out of the UPSTAIRS ROOM, and hears--*

                                  MARGO (O.C.)*
                    But the ghouls, they re with us?

      David looks down, to see his sister, MARGO HAYDEN (24, sleek, *
      professional), entering.  She s looking over her shoulder, at--*

      DETECTIVE COSTA.  Surprise: he s on the HAYDEN S PAYROLL.  *
      Costa s followed in by two GOONS.  The pair walk ahead, *
      carrying a CRATE into a ROOM, as Margo and Costa sidebar.*

                                  COSTA*
                    Maybe.  There s been rumblings.
                          (off Margo)*
                    With your pop the way he is-- and *
                    now that Saul s gone-- the other 
                    families have... concerns.

      ON MARGO.  Getting the hint.  Her eyes narrow.

                                  MARGO*
                    What do I pay you for?  Tell the *
                    ghouls, the djinn, and everybody: I *
                    run this family now.  So they can *
                    either back us-- or I ll bend  em 
                    over, jam a .45 elbow deep, and 
                    empty the damn clip.

      Costa WINCES, as the pair turn-- to see DAVID approaching.  *

                                  MARGO*
                    Huh.  You actually came.*

      Even after they talked on the phone, she s SURPRISED to see *
      him; didn t have much faith.  David pushes past that.*

                                  DAVID*
                    Margo-- wow.  You look so legit.  *
                    What happened to the mohawk and the *
                    tongue stud?*

      He says it with a smile, but there s TENSION here.  *

                                  COSTA*
                    Welcome back, David.  I m sorry *
                    about Saul, he was a good one.

                                  DAVID
                    The best, thanks Freddie.*
                          (beat)*
                    What happened to him?

                                  MARGO
                    Julian Durant happened.
                          (off David)
                    Word is, he and Saul had a dust up 
                    in the backroom at Il Secundo.  
                    Then the wolf circled around, and 
                    tore that place apart.
                          (beat)
                    He clawed out Saul s heart.  And he *
                    will bleed for that.*

      She moves to the ADJOINING ROOM, and opens it--*

      INT. HAYDEN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT2323

      To reveal a whole lot of GUNS.  AK-47s, M240s, and more.  *
      Four THUGS work, loading them with RIBBONS OF SILVER BULLETS. *
      David stares-- shit.  Costa moves close to him.-- whispering--*

                    Your sister-- maybe you can talk 
                    some sense into her,  cause I sure 
                    as Hell can t.

      He steps back, David turns to Margo--*

                                  DAVID

      EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT2424

      The place is a CRIME SCENE.  Police tape, etc... ENNIS steps *
      into frame, gaze darting to the spot Tamara died-- blood 
      still visible on the wall.  Ennis looks away.  Too painful.*

      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT2525*

      Ennis moves down the corridor.  Slow.  Wary.  And finds a *
      SECURITY DOOR on the back of the restaurant.  Hmmm...*      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  16.


      INT. RESTAURANT - BACKROOM - NIGHT2626*

      The off-screen sound of a LOCK POPPING, then-- ENNIS steps 
      inside, pocketing the LOCK PICK GUN.

      The GUTTED MONSTERS are gone, but smears of GORE still stain 
      the floor-- clearly, the clean-up is a work in progress.*

      Ennis-- wide-eyed-- moves through the space.  Clocking broken 
      glasses, a  table scarred with three LONG, JAGGED MARKS.  
      What the Hell are those?!  Then--*

      BANG!  The FRONT ENTRANCE (to the RESTAURANT) opens, and *
      Ennis DUCKS DOWN, as... the MAITRE D  ENTERS, pushing a MOP.*

      ON ENNIS.  Crouched behind the bar.  Trapped.  *

      The MAITRE D  SLOPS the mop to the floor, starts to work-- 
      then stops.  SNIFFING the air.  Smelling ENNIS.  He takes a *
      step toward the bar.  Moving closer... CLOSER...*

      ON ENNIS.  Hearing footsteps.  Mind racing, then-- he gets an *
      idea.  Ennis POPS UP-- bluffing--*

                                  ENNIS*
                    Chicago PD.  Stay where you are.*

      The maitre d  regards the kid for a moment-- then smirks--*

                                  MAITRE D *
                    I don t think so, Engagement Boy.*

      And he FLASHES FANGS!  Dude s a VAMPIRE!  Ennis jerks back, *
      eyes popping wide-- HOLY FUCKING SHIT!*

      The vamp CHARGES, as Ennis fumbles his father s gun into his *
      hand-- BAM!  And the monster s on him, driving Ennis back--*

      BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Ennis fires into the freak s belly.  It *
      barely seems to notice.*

      The vamp SLAMS Ennis into the wall, and rears back.  It s  *
      about to RIP OUT ENNIS S THROAT, when--*

      A machete DECAPITATES him from behind!  The VAMP DROPS--*
      Revealing SAM AND DEAN WINCHESTER.  Just in time.  *

      INT. RESTAURANT - BACKROOM - NIGHT2727

      We pick up on ENNIS.  Staring at the HEADLESS CORPSE on the *
      floor.  Whoa... DEAN steps in, nodding at the vamp.*

                                  DEAN
                    Gotta say, he looks better with a 
                    little off the top.
                          (then, to Ennis)
                    You wanna run, now s the time.

      But Ennis is STRONG.  Resolute.  *

                                  ENNIS
                    I m not going anywhere, until 
                    someone tells me what the Hell s 
                    going on.

                                  DEAN
                    I said: go.

                                  ENNIS*
                    No.

      He s giving it right back.  Sam steps between them.*

                                  SAM
                    Look, he was a vampire.
                          (sighs)
                      A monster.

                                  ENNIS
                    Thought you said there s no such 
                    thing as monsters.

      He s looking straight at Dean.  Kid s got moxie.  Beat, then--

                                  DEAN
                    Alright.  Fine.  Sammy, give him 
                    the talk.

      Dean moves away, STUDYING THE ROOM, as Sam lays it out:

                                  SAM
                    My name s Sam Winchester, that s my 
                    brother, Dean.  We kill vampires.  *
                    And werewolves, and demons, and--*
                          (shrug)*
                      Basically, we chase down evil-- and *
                    shoot it in the face.*

                    Like I told you, the thing I saw 
                    last night?  Wasn t human.  And I

                                  SAM
                    No.  People like us stay off the 
                    grid, and on the road.  *

                                  ENNIS

                    mirror?  With the eff d up face?

                                  SAM
                    Probably a wraith.  Some things look 
                    human, until you catch them in a 
                    mirror, or-- sometimes a camera... 

                                  ENNIS*
                    So you find this... whatever, and 
                    you re gonna chop its head off?

                                  SAM
                    Depends.  Some monsters you 
                      decapitate, some you burn-- when in 
                    doubt, try a silver bullet.

      Just like Ennis found in his dad s LOCKER.

                    to the New York wolfpack, to seal 
                    some deal.

      David absorbs that he had no idea, and that hurts-- but he  *

      And then he s GONE, leaving Margo-- PISSED-- behind.*

      INT. ROWHOUSE - ENNIS S ROOM - NIGHT3030*

      Ennis sits at his desk, Googling Saul Hayden.  Bringing up a *
      profile page-- looks like he was a VP at TRINITY PLASMA.  *

      As Ennis clicks another link, his eyes drift to his FATHER S *
      SILVER BULLET on the desk, as the DOORBELL RINGS.  *

      INT. ROWHOUSE - NIGHT3131

      Ennis opens the door-- to see COSTA.

                                  COSTA
                    Hey-- can we talk?

      Ennis steps aside, letting Costa in to the ENTRYWAY.*

                                  ENNIS*
                    About what?*

                                  COSTA*
                    Last night.  This thing you think *
                    killed Tamara-- what d it look 
                    like?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  23.

                                  ENNIS
                    Thing?  You said it was  some *
                    banger, with a knife. 

                                  COSTA
                    Chasing down every lead, kid.

      Ennis shoots him a look-- not like Costa to change his mind.

                                  ENNIS
                    Like I told you, it didn t have 
                    much of a face.

                                  COSTA
                    He-- it-- whatever-- say anything?

                                  ENNIS
                    I told you that too.

                                  COSTA
                          (with a frustrated edge)
                    Then tell me again.

      And that makes Ennis even MORE SUSPICIOUS.  Something s wrong. *

                                  ENNIS
                    Hey, if you got the time...*
                            (lightbulb)*
                    Why don t you stay for dinner?  *
                    Dad ll be home, he d love to see you.*

                                  COSTA
                    Uh, sure.  Be good to see him too.

      And now Ennis has the proof he needs.  Costa-- the REAL COSTA-- 
      knows his father is DEAD.  Who-- or what-- is this guy?

                                  COSTA*
                    Look, Ennis, I know this is hard-- 

      He looks up-- to see Ennis is pulling out his CELLPHONE.*

                                  ENNIS
                    Sorry.  Text.

      But he s lying.  We move OVER ENNIS S SHOULDER-- to see he s 
      got the phone s CAMERA ON.  Aiming it (covertly) at COSTA.

                                  COSTA
                    No worries.

      CAMERA POV: As Costa s EYES FLARE!  He s a MONSTER.  Ennis 
      takes a beat-- shit!-- but holds it together.  Gets an IDEA.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  24.

                    pretty good.  Forensics went over

                                  COSTA
                    That d be great.*

      INT. ROWHOUSE - ENNIS S ROOM - NIGHT3232*

      ENNIS enters, and heads for the CLOSET.  Costa right behind.  *

                                  COSTA*
                      Appreciate this kid.  Really.*

      Ennis opens the CLOSET-- but he reaches PAST his JACKET from *
      our Teaser, going for... *

      His father s GUN BOX.  Ennis opens it, and takes the SILVER *
      BULLET from his pocket-- sliding it into the REVOLVER while--*

      COSTA stands, moves to the window.  Staring out at the city.*

      Beat, then he turns-- and sees ENNIS POINTING THE GUN AT HIM!  *

                                  ENNIS
                    There s a silver bullet in this gun.

      Before Julian can do more than smile-- the door opens, and 
      VIOLET DURANT (22, delicate, gorgeous) steps in.  Anxious.   *

                    him off that easy.

                                  VIOLET
                    You ve seen his body?

                    I m thorough, aren t I?

                                  VIOLET
                    Then who did it?

                    Like I care.  Are we done?

                    Why are you meeting with the djinn?*

                                  JULIAN
                    Because word on the street is, the 
                    Haydens want me dead.

      ON VIOLET.  Processing that--*

                    But if you didn t kill Saul--

                                  JULIAN
                    That whore Margo Hayden thinks I 
                    killed him.  And I m not gonna tell 
                    her any different.

                                  VIOLET
                    Why?  Does dad know about this?*

                                  JULIAN
                    He s still in New York.  Father 
                    says I should lay low-- he doesn t 
                    think violence is good for 
                    business.  But...
                          (a smirk)
                    If the Haydens start this fight--*

                    You can finish it.

                    What do you think you re doing?  Huh?

      Violet looks away-- that cuts deep.  Julian steps back.  *

      Violet absorbs that-- COWED.  Julian steps back with a smirk-- *
      and heads into the drawing room. *

      EXT. DURANT ESTATE - NIGHT3838*

      We pull back from the TOWERING WALLS-- to find THE IMPALA 
      parked just up the road.  DEAN is behind the wheel, while SAM *
      scopes out the estate.

                                  SAM
                    So Julian Durant pays to see Saul s

                    castle.  Who is this guy?

      As they talk, we MOVE FURTHER BACK to find-- ENNIS, rounding *
      the corner.  On the case.  He spots the IMPALA, and FREEZES.  *
      Ennis knows that car.*

      ON ENNIS.  Mind racing-- what to do?-- then--*

      Something flashes in the corner of his eye, and Ennis turns-- *

      To see a SHAPE perched on top of the stone.  The FACELESS *

      Violet turns away, TEARS welling-- and we ANGLE UP to reveal--

      Our FACELESS FRIEND perched on the roof.  It TENSES--

      BAM!  And ATTACKS.  Slamming into David-- throwing  him to 
      the ground.  Violet spins-- sees THE THING-- sees DAVID.

      Violet SPRINTS across the lawn, MONSTER right behind.  CUT TO-

      MONSTER POV: Locked on her.  Gaining fast.  

      Violet DUCKS into a stand of TREES, and the creature s about 
      to follow when-- 

      WHAM!  DAVID tackles it from behind!  The two crashing to the 
      ground!  

      David tries to FIGHT-- but the figure pins him to the dirt.  
      Breath raspy.  SILVER CLAWS digging into David s flesh.  
      BURNING HIM.  Then--

      BLAM!  A bullet cracks past the thing s shoulder.

      and comes face-to-face with the THING!  Violet SCREAMS--*

      And DAVID hears.  He jerks to his feet, pushing past Ennis-- *

      A RUSTLE in the brush, Ennis wheels around-- as SAM and DEAN *

                    Who s her?  Who are you?*

      As Sam speaks, Dean peers through the brush-- to see GUARDS *
      patrolling the grounds.  They heard the shot too.

      CLOSE ON: VIOLET S COAT.  Lying in a heap on a dirty floor-- 
      her CELLPHONE sticking out of a pocket.  It starts to 
      VIBRATE, the name  David  flashing on the screen.

      WIDEN TO: VIOLET.  Her wrists CHAINED to an overhead pipe.  
      Dress stained.  Feet bare.  She BLINKS AWAKE--

      And sees PICTURES.  All of the same BOY.  From birth to age 
      8.  They paper the walls, along with dozens of ARTICLES.  

      Violet focuses-- and we GO TIGHT on a few headlines:  Tragic 
      Death ,  Vicious Mauling ,  Wild Animal Attack .  Then--

      Something SHIFTS in the darkness behind Violet.  She turns--

                    I know you think I m some freak--
                    like you.  But I m not.

      As it speaks, the thing pulls back its hood-- to reveal a 
      BLACK NYLON MASK.  The figure sloughs it off, and underneath--

      Is IKE SOKOLOWSKI.  40s, balding, working class, NORMAL-- and 
      wearing a pair of slim, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. 

      He pushes the goggles up, and raises a hand encased in a 
      leather GLOVE-- its fingers tipped with SILVER CLAWS.  

                                  IKE
                    I m just a man.  With some fun 
                    little toys.

      EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT4646*

      The IMPALA pulls up in front of a an abandoned, rundown *
      factory, in an abandoned, rundown, INDUSTRIAL part of town. *
      DEAN steps out, holding up his PHONE-- scanning the structure.*

                                  DEAN*
                    Signal s coming from that craphole.*

      Ennis and David move to follow him-- Sam blocks their path.*

                                  SAM*
                    Stay here.*

      Ennis fixes Sam with a hard look-- voice soft, but strong.*

                                  ENNIS*
                    Sam-- Tamara was everything to me.  *
                      Everything.  So if the son of a *
                    bitch that killed her is in there?    *
                    No way in Hell you re keeping me *
                    out.  No way.*

                    I m coming too.*

      And he s just as determined as Ennis.  Dean approaches-- *

                                  DEAN*
                    What s up?  *

      ON SAM.  Studying David and Ennis.  Feeling for them.*

      He and Sam start gearing up-- David and Ennis take a moment.  *

                    Silver.  It burns if you re evil.  *
                    If you re a monster.  *

      He DRAGS the tip of a claw across her cheek-- the scratch *
      SIZZLING.  Violet FLINCHES away-- and Ike GRABS her jaw--*

                                  IKE*
                    No!  You look at him!*

      He twists Violet s head-- so she faces a PHOTO of the child.  *

                                  IKE*
                    He was my son-- and your brother *
                    and the shifter, Hayden...  they *

                          (off Violet)*
                    The police said it was a wild *

                    years.  Until Deacon showed me the *
                    truth.*

                    He trained me-- he gave me my *

      Violet swallows hard-- scared, but daring to push back--*

                    Please-- Saul-- Julian, they hated *

                    That s what you want.  You re *

                    chaos, with humans caught in the

                    many people-- how many children 
                    will die?

      And that hits home-- for the first time, Ike HESITATES--

      WHAM!  And a DOOR upstairs slides OPEN.  Jarring Ike back to *
      reality.  He s got COMPANY.

      INT. FACTORY - NIGHT4848

      The space is big and cluttered-- empty crates, old machines. 
      A STAIRCASE leads to the second floor.

      SAM, DEAN, ENNIS and DAVID step in.  Armed to the teeth.  The 
      Winchesters trade a look-- then Dean nods to David--



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      "Tribes"          2nd Network Draft            1/22/14  38.

      Sam and Ennis go UPSTAIRS, as Dean and David stalk the MAIN *

                    So you re the good monster, huh?*

      David just rolls his eyes-- dude...  Dean shrugs-- what?-- 
      and moves ahead, as--*

      A SHADOW flashes in his peripheral vision.  David turns, to 
      see THE THING (IKE) disappearing around a corner.  

      David freezes, and looks for Dean-- but he s disappeared down *
      another corridor.  David takes a deep breath-- then GOES *
      AFTER IKE.  Moving ahead.  Gun up.  Ready.  CUT TO--*

      MONSTER POV:  Looking down at David from ABOVE.  Then--*

      We re with DEAN, as he glances over his shoulder... and *

                    David!

      He looks up... to see VIOLET-- still shackled-- as IKE steps 
      into the room behind him... and SLAMS the door.

      INT. FACTORY - NIGHT5050

      SAM, DEAN and ENNIS-- standing right where David got jumped.  
      Staring down at his orphaned SHOTGUN.  Dean s eyes scan the *
      floor, seeing a trail of CRIMSON DROPS.

      Sam and Dean trade a look-- time to play follow the blood.*

      INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT5151*

      ON DAVID.  In AGONY, as Ike CINCHES him to a METAL SHELF-- a *

                    I heard you talking-- real sweet.  
                    Hell, it was almost human.

      He leans in, eye-to-eye with David.

                    But here s the thing: you can look

                    Deep down?  You re just a monster.

      He presses his CLAWS to David s chest-- and skin SIZZLES.  
      David HISSES in PAIN--*

      ON VIOLET.  Hurting.  Scared.  Pushed way past the edge.  *

      AND VIOLET WOLFS OUT!  Popping CLAWS and FANGS!  Holy shit!  
      With a SNARL, Violet BREAKS her chains-- 

      And CHARGES Ike.  He tries to fight, but she s strong-- and 
      fast-- and MEAN!  Ike doesn t stand a chance.  

      ON DAVID.  He PULLS FREE of the rope, as--

      Ike FALLS to the ground-- beat-- bloody-- and Violet s on him 
      in a FLASH!  About to bite his fucking face off--

      When HANDS grab her-- from behind.  DAVID.  She STRUGGLES--

                    I don t know, maybe you are.  Or 
                    maybe you just see a way out.

                    David s my brother-- it s my job to 
                    protect him.

                    Pure bloodlines are the one thing 
                    we agree on.

      Saul leans in CLOSE.  Scary as fuck--

                    David wants to go straight, that s

                    and dump what s left in the lake.

      ON VIOLET.  Fighting back tears.

                                  VIOLET
                    But... I do love him.

      EXT. DURANT ESTATE - NIGHT - RESUME PRESENT5656

      ON VIOLET.  Remembering.  David s talking--

                                  DAVID
                    ...even after I left the family-- I 
                    knew if things got bad, Saul would 
                    always have my back.  So... what *
                    did he mean?

      Violet knows how much Saul meant to David-- she takes a 
      CONFLICTED BEAT.  And swallows the truth.  

                                  VIOLET
                    I don t know.  I should go.

      David reacts to that-- frowning-- not what he was hoping for--

                                  DAVID
                    Right.  Sure.  Guess that s what 
                    you do best.

      ON VIOLET.  She takes a moment.  Conflicted.

                                  VIOLET
                    David?

      He glances up-- and VIOLET KISSES HIM.  Aggressively.  
      Passionately. Drawing a touch of blood.  

      And DAVID KISSES HER BACK, as the Hunters trade a look-- *

      The two part.  And Violet hurries away-- embarrassed, 
      vulnerable.  Leaving David hot, bothered, and CONFLICTED.

      INT. DURANT ESTATE - FOYER - NIGHT5757

      Violet enters-- and JULIAN beelines for her.  Pissed.

                                  JULIAN
                    Where have you been?  You know how 
                    many guys I ve had looking for you?*

      Violet ignores him-- keeps walking-- Julian GRABS her arm--

                                  JULIAN
                    Answer me.

      Violet looks him dead in the eye, her newfound STRENGTH 
      shining through.

      It s just one word-- but a whole new Violet.  Julian 
      hesitates-- where did that come from?-- and Violet pulls 
      away.  Heads up the stairs.

                                  VIOLET
                    Oh, and the wedding s off-- with

      TAMARA S FUNERAL.  Modest.  Simple.  A picture of her smiles 
      over the casket, as it s lowered into the ground.  

      ENNIS stands next to SAM.  DEAN, and COSTA are there as well, *
      along with a few other MOURNERS and a PASTOR.  Then--

      ON SAM AND DEAN.  Having a HUSHED CONVERSATION.

                    ...you want to leave?  Dean-- this

                                  DEAN
                    I don t want-- Crowley s got a line 
                    on Abaddon.  This is our shot, Sam.

      There s FIRE in his eyes-- as previous episodes have shown us 
      Dean is totally, RECKLESSLY committed to taking Abaddon down.

                                  SAM
                    There s something we have to do.

                    One more thing: this guy-- his name *
                    was Ike Sokolowski.  And the cop  *
                    who told him a  wild animal  killed *
                    his son?  It was--*

                                  ENNIS*
                    Detective Nate Roth. *
                          (re: the articles)*
                    I can read too.*

                                  DAVID*
                    Do you know how your dad was mixed *
                    up in all this?*

                                  ENNIS*
                          (beat)*
                    Not yet.*

      But it s clear Ennis is ROCKED by that information.  He steps *
      out the door.  David watches him go.*

                                  DAVID*
                    I ll see you around, Ennis.*

                                  ENNIS*
                    Yeah.  You will.*

      EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT7070*

      ENNIS emerges, and we PAN UP-- to see Chicago.  Glittering *
      against the night sky.  *

      This beautiful city... this brand new world... *

                                                                          BLACKOUT.*
