Moss-draped. Shadow-drenched. Tortured tree trunks twist
upward, reaching for rare sunlight.
BELLA (V.O.)
I'd never given much thought to how I would die..
Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither
bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near.
Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping.
Abruptly, we're on the move. Fast.
UNKNOWN POV - MOVING
Trees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed, branches
are dodged with preternatural agility. And we're speeding
up, chasing something. It's exhilarating. Terrifying.
Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey -
-
A DEER
-- running for its life as it darts through this maze of
a forest. It sprints forward, but we gain on it. Beyond the deer,
SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the
trees. The buck races for the light. We're just behind it,
about to emerge from the shadowy darkness -
-
The deer LEAPS into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly
SLOW MOTION) against the WHITE GLARE of the sun... then BAM!
The deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle,
leaving the WHITE GLARE to fill the screen. HOLD ON WHITENESS
-
BELLA (V.O.)
But dying in the place of someone I
love seems like a good way to go..
.
-- Then into the WHITENESS steps the face of -
2 ISABELLA SWAN, 172
Eyes closed against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long,
dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a vulnerable,
introverted, imperfect beauty.
BELLA (V.O.)
... So I can't bring myself to
regret the decision that brought me
here to die...
The background comes into focus as we realize we're now in -
2.
Bella stands at the end of a cul-de-sac on the desert's edge.
The sun blazes behind her -- she bends down and carefully
scoops a tiny BARREL CACTUS into a clay pot.
BELLA (V.O.)
... The decision to leave home.
She stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until
BLONDE #1 (O.S.)
Bye, Bella!
BELLA'S POV - McMansion ACROSS THE STREET
Three tanned, athletic, blonde GIRLS hop into a convertible
Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts
with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave.
BLONDE #
Good luck at your new school!
They ADLIB superficial good wishes, "Don't forget to write;"
"We'll miss you." Bella waves back, sweetly, but
halfheartedly as she steps off the curb.
BELLA
Have a good..
--and trips. When she rights herself, they're already gone.
BELLA
... life.
Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and
innate intelligence become apparent as -
-
BELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's
low rent for this ritzy neighborhood. Rene is eclectic,
scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent. She
thrusts a cell phone at Bella.
RENE
It won't work again, baby.
BELLA
You put it on hold.
RENE
I did?
BELLA
Look. You also called Mexico.
Rene pushes her playfully, they laugh.
3.
RENE
I'll figure it out. You gotta be able
to reach me and Phil on the road -
I
love saying that - on the road.
BELLA
Very romantic.
PHIL, 31, good looking with an athlete's body, exits the
house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease.
PHIL
If you call crappy motels, backwater
towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic.
He puts his Phoenix Desert Dogs baseball hat on Rene's head with
a
kiss. Phil's love of Rene reassures Bella. Phil heads to the old
station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm
through Bella's, clinging to her as they walk to car.
RENE
Now, you know if you change your
mind, I'll race back here from
wherever the game is.
But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great
sacrifice that would be. Bella forces a smile.
BELLA
I won't change my mind, mom.
RENE
You might. You've always hated Forks.
BELLA
It's not about Forks, it's about
Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we
barely know each other.
(off Rene's still worried
look)
Mom, I want to go. I'll be fine.
But as Rene hugs Bella, we see the truth on BELLA'S FACE
dread, doubt, regret. Off Bella, struggling to keep her
facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car..

BEGIN TITLES OVER:
3 BELLA'S POV OUT THE CAR WINDOW - SCOTTSDALE

Bella, IPOD earbuds in her ears, gets a last glimpse of the
sparkling malls, chic shoppers, manicured cactus gardens..
.
PULL UP AND OUT OF THE CAR UNTIL WE'RE -
-
4.

The McMansions get smaller as we SWEEP OVER the scorched
landscape, baking under a hot sun. Beyond the housing
developments SEE the rocky, dry desert, extending for miles..
.
Rise HIGHER, and higher still, until finally we're suspended
within the bright, perfect, blue SKY, with only an occasional
cloud..
.
Slowly, the clouds start getting more numerous, thicker, darker..
.
until we're completely immersed in them... the sun disappearing.
Finally, we EMERGE from the clouds to find below
-
Nothing but deep, dark, green forests for miles. SWEEP DOWN,
finding the eerily dramatic Lake Crescent. Over it all hangs
the mist from the ever-present cloudy grey sky. Everything
is wet and green and drenched in shade..
.
FIND A TWO LANE HIGHWAY along which drives A POLICE
CRUISER... PUSH IN on the cruiser until we reach
-
THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW
Bella looks out, taking in her gloomy new surroundings..
.
END TITLES.
7
As the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in this logging town
-
every storefront has a wood carving. The Timber Museum's sign is
two loggers sawing a stump. The POLICE STATION is a small wooden
building across from City Hall..
.
8
The cruiser pulls up to the old two-story house. A woodshed full
of firewood. There's a small boat in the garage, fishing gear, an
old buoy. Bella climbs out... home.
Bella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver, JACOB BLACK,
16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of
childish roundness in his face. The two of them help Jacob's
father, BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a wheelchair.
CHARLIE
Bella, you remember Billy Black.
BILLY
Glad you're finally here. Charlie
hasn't shut up about it since you
told him you were coming.
CHARLIE
Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you
down the hill.
BILLY
Right after I ram you in the ankles.
Billy takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges. Jacob shakes
his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella.
JACOB
I'm Jacob. We made mud pies
together when we were little kids.
BELLA
Yeah... I think I remember..
.
(re: the dads)
Are they always like this?
JACOB
It's getting worse with old age.
Charlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella
-
CHARLIE
So what do you think of your
homecoming gift?
BELLA
No way. The truck is for me?
CHARLIE
Just bought it off Billy, here.
JACOB
I rebuilt the engine and -
-
BELLA
It's perfect!
7.
She beams. It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her.
She rushes to the truck. Jacob eagerly joins her.
JACOB
Okay, so you gotta double pump the
clutch when you shift, but -
-
He hands her the keys as she climbs in.
BELLA
Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
JACOB
I go to school on the reservation.
BELLA
Too bad. Would've been nice to
know at least one person.
As she starts up the truck we MATCH CUT
-
Loud, belching and turning heads as Bella parks, mortified. All
eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps in
a
PUDDLE, soaking her sneakers. She slinks toward school, as we
begin
-
Edward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens,
while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck. The many eyes still
watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches
-
-- The guard BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his
footing and TRIPS, breaking through the rail and pitching
over the side, into the air
-
-- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing.
A
HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out
of frame with incredible strength. His guttural SCREAM is
choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING..
.
Rene talks on a pay phone, her dead cell phone in her hand.
In the b.g., Phil and an Attendant work on the Subaru engine.
RENE
Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It
ran away. Screaming. I literally
repel technology now.
17.
Bella smiles, missing her mom. Rene feeds the phone
quarters.
RENE
Now, tell me more about your
school, baby. What are the kids
like? Are there any cute guys?
Are they being nice to you?
BELLA
(a beat, lying)
They've all been really..
.
welcoming.
PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE, getting mad all over again as..
.
FLASH POP TO -EDWARD'S FACE, HIS COAL BLACK EYES, THE FURY..
.
SMASH TO:
ON BELLA, sitting atop a table, an open book in her lap. But her
eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull
in. She's waiting for Edward.
Jessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball
nearby. They wave Bella to join them but she smiles,
declining... and returns to watching for Edward. Her face
tells us she's ready for a confrontation.
Bella exits with Angela, Mike, Jessica and Eric, becoming a part
of this circle.
18.
She now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 BMW, as it drives
past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns to
her friends, finally forgetting about him..
.
SERIES OF SCENES ENDS as we go to
-
ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay
filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of
puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight.
BELLA
Great.
WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her
truck.
BELLA
Dad, I can drive myself to school.
As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's
watching her -
-
UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE TREES
--tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on
a
patch of ice -
-
BACK ON BELLA - fallen on her ass. Charlie climbs out of the
truck, helps her up.
CHARLIE
You okay, Bells?
BELLA
Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.
CHARLIE
That's why I got you new tires.
She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires.
CHARLIE
The other ones were nearly bald.
19.
BELLA
You got me new tires. No one's
ever done that before.
Charlie looks at her, confused.
BELLA
I mean... nothing.
He clearly doesn't get it as heads toward his Cruiser.
CHARLIE
I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading
down to Mason County. A security guard
at the Grisham Mill got killed by some
kind of animal..
.
UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND CHARLIE, as he speaks..
.
BELLA
An animal?
CHARLIE
You're not in Phoenix any more,
honey. They've been hunting it for
a week with no luck. Thought I'd
lend a hand.
BELLA
Be careful.
CHARLIE
Always am.
BACK ON BELLA..
.
BELLA
And thank you. For the tires.
He sees emotion in her eyes. Doesn't understand it, but nods,
heads inside. Bella looks at the tires again, oddly moved..
.
34 OMITTED 34
The rain has stopped, but the parking lot is full of water
and patches of black ice.
24.
Shivering, Bella heads for her truck, carrying the onion,
carefully navigating the icy puddles. As she reaches her
truck, she looks across the lot
EDWARD stands by his silver Volvo with his siblings, about to
climb in. A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks toward the
sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER..
.
Bella turns to see a VAN -- skidding on the ice, careening out of
control, heading directly for her. TIME suddenly fractures,
compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as
-
-- THE FACES OF THE STUDENTS - in shock, seeing what's coming.
--THE VAN DRIVER'S FACE -TYLER, desperately trying to gain
control, then shielding his face.
-- EDWARD'S FACE - looking at Bella with horror..
.
THE VAN is about to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in
between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning
her to the ground. She looks up - Edward is on top of her.
The world around them FREEZES -- in this fraction of
a
second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying. He
breathes in her scent, she takes in his flawless face..
.
Abruptly, we BLAST BACK TO SPEED as several things happen so
quickly, we, and Bella, are unsure what's going on:
-- THE VAN SMASHES into the back of Bella's truck
-
-- Then SPINS around, once again careening toward her and
Edward, then suddenly
-
--EDWARD'S HANDS are creating a deep dent in the side of the
van's body as it shudders to a stop, a foot from Bella.
-- Edward literally pushes the van away.
Then silence. A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at
Edward, trying to absorb what just happened. Edward's fear for
her is still alive on his face. She starts to speak but..
.
THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help. People leap to
Tyler's aid, run to Bella and Edward. Bella SEES the onion on the
ground, smashed as she would have been. As everyone sweeps in,
Edward moves into the b.g. Mike and Eric run to Bella
-
MIKE ERIC
Are you okay!? Are you What happened!? Did anyone
hurt?! see what happened?
!
Amid the chaos, Bella sees EDWARD'S SIBLINGS looking at
Edward. But they show no hint of concern for his safety.
Instead, they look at him with disapproval... and fury.
Bella stands in the exact spot of the accident. Behind her
on the lawn, several CLASSES congregate, gathering for
a
field trip. Mr. Molina is in charge.
MR. MOLINA
Make sure I get your permission slips.
29.
PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE staring at the skid marks on the
pavement..
.
FLASH POP TO THE VAN REELING RIGHT FOR HER
-
FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S HANDS STOPPING THE VAN
-
FLASH POP TO EDWARD ON TOP OF HER, THE PROXIMITY, ELECTRICITY
-
BACK ON BELLA, blushing at the memory. Then she SEES Edward
arrive with Alice and Jasper. She watches him, barely noticing as
Mike trots up to her -
-
MIKE
(ala Dr. Frankenstein)
Look! You're moving. You're ALIVE!
BELLA
... Yeah, false alarm..
.
MIKE
Actually, I'm glad you're not dead
cause - well, that would suck, plus
I
wanted to ask you - even though it's,
like, a month away..
.
But Bella's distracted by Edward. Mike's VOICE DIPS as..
.
BELLA'S POV - ACROSS THE LAWN
Edward, head down, is in quiet conference with Jasper and Alice.
Abruptly, he looks up, as if listening to her and Mike, though
he's too far away to hear. Bella quickly refocuses on Mike.
MIKE
So what do you think?
(off her blank look)
You want to go? To prom. With me.
BELLA
(realizing, horrified)
Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go
-somewhere. To Jacksonville. Yeah.
MIKE
You can't go another weekend?
BELLA
Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you
should ask Jessica.
Mike follows Bella's eyes way across the lawn to Jessica.
She smiles at them -- Suddenly Edward crosses in front of
Jessica. He seems to be smirking..
.
30.
--where everyone's looking at the COMPOST WORM BOX, grossing
each other out with the slimy creatures. As Bella backs away,
Edward steps up.
EDWARD
Bella, it would be better if we
weren't friends.
BELLA
(wounded)
Too bad you didn't figure that out
earlier.
(MORE)
32.
BELLA (cont'd)
You could have let the van crush me
and saved yourself all this regret.
EDWARD
(snapping, angry)
You think I regret saving you?
BELLA
I know you do.
EDWARD
(furious)
You don't know anything.
His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at
Edward's side. She eyes Bella with curiosity.
ALICE
The bus is leaving.
(to Bella)
Hi. Will you be riding with us?
EDWARD
No. Our bus is full.
He purposefully walks Alice away. But he glances back at
Bella with, is that... remorse? She doesn't see it.
It's freezing, but Mike, Tyler, Jessica and others suit up
for a surf. Eric hangs with them. Bella wanders by the
driftwood with Angela, who takes photographs.
ANGELA
I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me
to prom, then he just... doesn't.
BELLA
You could ask him.
(off Angela's flustered
look)
Take control. You're a strong
independent woman.
ANGELA
I am?
JACOB (O.S.
)
Bella!
She looks up to see three Quileute boys approaching the group;
Jacob Black, and SAM and EMBRY. Bella smiles at Jacob.
BELLA
Guys, this is Jacob. Are you
stalking me?
JACOB
You're on my rez, remember? You
surfing?
BELLA
Definitely not.
JESSICA
(teasing)
Keep her company. Her date bailed.
ERIC
What date?
36.
JESSICA
She invited Edward.
BELLA
(embarrassed)
To be polite.
ANGELA
I think it's nice she invited him.
No one ever does.
MIKE
Because Cullen's a freak.
SAM
You got that right.
BELLA
You know them?
SAM
(sharply)
The Cullens don't come here.
Jacob shoots Sam a look, shakes his head. Bella registers this.
A beat, then she casually pulls Jacob aside
-
BELLA
You want to go look at tide pools?
She offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile. He grins,
infatuated. As they head toward the water..
.
Bella and Jacob wander near the water, looking out to sea for
whales. The surfers are out on the waves. She nudges him,
continuing her attempt at flirtation..
.
BELLA
So, what did your friend mean about
the Cullens not coming here?
JACOB
Oops. Caught that, huh?
He moves closer to her, lowering his voice for mock-secrecy.
JACOB
I'm not supposed to say anything.
Bella gives him her best alluring smile.
BELLA
I can keep a secret..
.
37.
JACOB
(laughing)
It's just an old scary story. Did
you know the Quileutes are
supposedly descended from wolves?
BELLA
Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?
Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to continue..
.
BELLA
So the legend about the Cullens is..
.
JACOB
Well, they're supposedly descended
from this, like..
.
(in a spooky voice)
enemy clan. ... But they
claimed to be different, so we made
a treaty with them.
BELLA
Didn't they just move here?
JACOB
Or just moved back.
BELLA
Riiiight. So what was this treaty?
JACOB
(whispering)
If they promised to stay off Quileute
lands, we wouldn't expose what they
really were to the pale-faces..
.
Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers.
GIRL (O.S)
AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!!
!
Bella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past,
chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean. Jacob smirks and
starts back to the group.
BELLA
Wait... what were they really?
JACOB
(laughing)
It's just a story, Bella.
Off Bella, with more unanswered questions..
.
38.
A collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by
wood plank sidewalks. FIND Waylon Forge (the hippy logger
who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat,
swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman.
His old DOG lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and
river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his Walkman..
.
Suddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves. The
dog raises his head, starts to GROWL. Waylon doesn't notice.
STAY ON WAYLON, singing, working... until he looks up and
realizes the dog's gone.
WAYLON
Jerry?
Waylon pulls off the headphones. WHISTLES. No dog. Waylon
walks up a walkway... then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from
under a bush.
WAYLON
Come on, Jerry, you old mutt..
.
He pulls at the leg. It's detached. He reels back, stumbling
onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out
-
ON THE WATER - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely.
WAYLON'S POV -ON THE WOODS lining the river. Ominous
darkness. A NOISE. He jerks around. Nothing. Then
suddenly, his boat ROCKS violently; he spins
-
A MAN - now stands on the bow. JAMES, 30, pale white.
A
vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep,
sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal. His catlike
movements are always on the edge of a crouch.
WAYLON
H-how did you do that?
JAMES
Always the same inane questions..
.
Waylon turns but a woman LEAPS onto the bow --it's VICTORIA,
26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods.
Terrified, Waylon spins around to see LAURENT, 28, glossy
black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat. All three
Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot.
JAMES
What do you want?

39.
VICTORIA
Why are you doing this?

LAURENT
(sighs, slight French
accent)
... James, must we?
JAMES
The question should be, will it hurt?

Victoria grins sadistically. Then with lightening fast
speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE
-
SMASH TO BLACK:
51 FADE IN ON EDWARD'S FACE AGAINST BLACKNESS 51
SNAPSHOTS of his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips..
.
The sun has come out and so has the skin. Kids are in shorts
though it's still barely sixty degrees. Everyone eats lunch
outdoors. Bella searches the crowd for Edward.
JESSICA (O.S.
)
He's not here.
She looks down to find Jessica sitting on the grass.
JESSICA
Whenever the weather's nice, the
Cullens disappear.
BELLA
They just... ditch?
JESSICA
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank em
out for hiking and camping and
stuff. I tried the idea out on my
parents. Not even close.
Bella registers this as Angela suddenly jumps on them.
40.
ANGELA
I'm going to the prom with Eric!
I
just asked him, I took control!
(hugs Bella)
Are you sure you have to go out of town?
BELLA
It's a family thing.
JESSICA
Oh my God, we need to hit the
stores in Port Angeles before the
dresses get cleaned out.
BELLA
Port Angeles?..
.
(a plan forming in her
mind)
Can I go with you guys?
ANGELA
Thank God. We need your opinion.
Off Bella, that's not really what she had in mind..
.
Bella exits, thumbing through a BOOK she just bought. She
heads down the sidewalk, but then hears FOOTSTEPS behind her.
She turns, doesn't see anyone. She puts the book in her
shoulder bag and continues.
UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA -someone's following her. She looks
around, changing course to cut across a parking lot. Unknown
POV gets closer... and closer, until she reaches
-
Isolated. Bella, breath short, scared, turns around just as -
-
TWO MEN emerge from the shadows, not vampires, but the Frat
Boys, really wasted now.
FRAT BOY #
1
Wanna beer?
She looks to her left; the other TWO GUYS are there. She's
cornered. She takes her purse from around her shoulder.
BELLA
Look, just take my bag.
FRAT BOY #
2
We don't want your bag.
She takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her
wrist to use her purse as a mace. They chortle derisively.
But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in
the groin. The BOOK in her bag doubles him over. The other
three laugh, and start to close in. But suddenly
-
HEADLIGHTS blind them. A silver Volvo screeches up. The
Frat Boys dive out of the way. The passenger-side door
opens. It's Edward. She's too stunned to even move.
42.
EDWARD
Get in.
She finally does. But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and
rushes Edward's side of the car
-
Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing
Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it.
Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic
in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off.
As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him.
Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bella approaches.
ANGELA
Where were you!? We left you a message.
JESSICA
We waited, but we were starving
-
Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car.
They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort to be
charming. And they are charmed.
EDWARD
Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We
ran into each other and got talking.
43.
JESSICA
I - we - understand. We were
just... leaving, so
-
The two girls start to go. Bella is forced to go with them.
BELLA
Okay, well. Thank you.
She starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly
-
EDWARD
(abruptly)
Maybe I should make sure Bella gets
something to eat.
(off Bella's surprised
look)
... If you'd like. Then I could
drive you back myself.
ANGELA
That's so... thoughtful.
JESSICA
Really thoughtful.
BELLA
(debates, then decides)
I could eat.
As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and
a
noiseless scream of excitement.
Bella and Edward sit on the deck. A dramatic waterfall
shimmers behind them.
A waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon
in front of Bella and nothing in front of Edward. She exits.
BELLA
You're not eating?
EDWARD
I'm on a special diet.
BELLA
Like South Beach?
EDWARD
Not exactly.
She looks at him curiously as she takes a bite.
44.
BELLA
So how bout some answers?
EDWARD
Yes, no. To get to the other side,
and 1 point 772453851.
BELLA
I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
EDWARD
You knew that?
BELLA
How did you know where I was?
EDWARD
I didn't.
She shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside -
-
EDWARD
(stops her, sincerely)
Don't go.
He seems torn by some internal dilemma. Then finally..
.
BELLA
Were you following me?
EDWARD
I feel very protective of you.
BELLA
So that's a yes?
EDWARD
Yes, I followed you. I tried to
keep my distance...until you needed
help.
BELLA
(putting everything together)
You said before... That you heard
what those guys were thinking..
.
Can you... read minds?
EDWARD
(shrugs)
I'm thinking of getting a nine-
hundred number.
BELLA
(trying to grasp)
Alright, so you read minds... What am
I thinking? Wait -- okay now, go.
45.
EDWARD
I have no idea. I can read every
mind in there, except yours.
(points at people
inside)
Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend
-
(points at Bella)
Nothing. It's quite frustrating.
BELLA
Why, what's wrong with me?
EDWARD
I tell you I read minds and you think
there's something wrong with you?
He smiles, charmed by her. But his smile fades, that torn
look returns. He holds onto the rail, looking out.
BELLA
What is it?
EDWARD
I... don't have the strength to
stay away from you anymore.
She's surprised. And thrilled.
BELLA
Edward, you don't have to.
He's drawn in by her encouraging gaze... but he closes his
eyes a beat, and turns back to the water.
EDWARD
(almost to himself)
This is wrong.
BELLA
Edward
-
EDWARD
You're cold. We should go.
He walks away before she can ask any more questions..
.
Edward's Volvo speeds along the two lane highway.
The Volvo pulls up. Bella and Edward climb out. Edward then
sees a second car next to the cruiser.
EDWARD
That's my father's car. What's he --
?
EDWARD AND BELLA'S POV: INSIDE THE DARKENED POLICE STATION
In a pool of light, a distressed Charlie and Dr. Cullen study
photographs and evidence. As they wrap up their discussion,
Dr. Cullen puts a sympathetic hand on Charlie's shoulder,
then exits the police station looking grim.
EDWARD
Carlisle. What happened?
DR. CULLEN
Waylon Forge was found in the woods
out near his place. I just
examined the body.
Edward darkens. Bella is horrified.
BELLA
He died? How?
DR. CULLEN
Animal attack.
BELLA
The same kind that killed the security
guard down in Mason?
Edward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it.
47.
DR. CULLEN
Most likely.
BELLA
So it's getting closer to town.
EDWARD
Waylon lived all the way down on
Queets River. 75 miles south.
BELLA
But that's
-
DR. CULLEN
(with a kind, reassuring
smile)
Bella, you should go inside.
Waylon was your father's friend.
She goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring
quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to this.
Two Attendants hoist a metal gurney into an ambulance. On it,
Waylon's dead, white, bloody bare FEET peek out from under
a
sheet, resting at a disturbingly unnatural angle. Off Bella,
chilled..
.
SMASH TO:
FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S BLACK EYES
FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S COLD WHITE HAND.
FLASH POP TO THE FIVE CULLENS, SLOW MOTION, beautiful and white.
FLASH POP TO WAYLON'S TWISTED WHITE FEET
She stands in the center of the deserted, green lawn. Her
expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief. STAY
ON HER FACE, TIME LAPSING AS:
The bell rings and students exit class, rushing past Bella as
she stands still, waiting..
.
BELLA'S POV - EDWARD AND HIS SIBLINGS
-- cross the lawn, heading to class. Edward sees Bella, sees
the intensity on her face. He stops.
She walks to him, eyes meeting his... her look says, we have
to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the dark
forest that borders the school.
He watches her disappear in the trees, then takes a step to
follow. Jasper moves in front of him, Rosalie grabs his arm.
ROSALIE
Edward, don't go.
But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm.
ALICE
He's already there.
68
Bella stands amid the trees, waiting. Then the SOUNDS OF THE
FOREST abruptly drop out. A predator is near. Edward
appears behind her. She doesn't turn around. A beat.
50.
BELLA
You're impossibly fast. And strong.
Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold.
Your eyes change color. And
sometimes you speak like... you're
from a different time.
(turns to face him now)
You never eat food, or drink, or
come out in the sunlight. And you
said no to the beach trip only after
you heard where it was. Because of
the treaty.
This last registers with him. She steps closer to him.
BELLA
How old are you?
EDWARD
Seventeen.
BELLA
How long have you been seventeen?
A long beat as we begin to CIRCLE THEM. He sees he can't hide
anymore. Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it.
EDWARD
... A while.
She inhales. She knew, but it's still shocking. We CIRCLE
THEM FASTER
-
BELLA
I know what the Cold Ones are.
What you are.
EDWARD
Say it. Out loud. Say it.
All sound suddenly DROPS OUT. We hear only her whisper..
.
BELLA
... Vampire
They seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her
reality utterly rocked.
EDWARD
Are you afraid?
BELLA
No.
51.
EDWARD
(angry)
Then ask me the most basic
question: what do we eat?
BELLA
You won't hurt me. You're different.
EDWARD
You think you know me?
He glares at her. She holds her ground. Suddenly, he takes
her by the hand. Starts walking.
BELLA
Where are we going?
EDWARD
Up the mountain. Out of the cloud
bank. You need to see what
I
really am. What I look like in the
harsh light of the sun.
BELLA
No! The sunlight will kill you.
EDWARD
Myth. You need to see the truth.
He pulls her but she stumbles.
BELLA
Slow down.
Suddenly, he's right next to her.
EDWARD
Are you afraid?
BELLA
No.
EDWARD
Then come with me. Someplace where
no one can protect you. Where
I
could do what I've wanted to do from
the first moment I met you.
Their proximity is intense, riveting both of them.
BELLA
I'm not afraid.
EDWARD
You should be.
52.
He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms.
EDWARD
Hold on.
Then he flings her onto his back... and starts running.
As in the opening sequence, Edward races through the forest, dark
trunks STROBING past as he picks up speed, faster and faster.
Bella clings to his back as it seems he'll collide with the trees,
but he avoids them with supernatural grace. It's frightening,
nauseating, intoxicating.
EDWARD
Are you afraid!
?
BELLA
No!
But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude.
Higher and higher, above the fog layer. Finally, up ahead
-
THE FOREST'S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond. The
sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to
emerge from the shadowy darkness... but suddenly-
Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree.
All is silent. She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium.
Then she realizes she's alone.
BELLA
Edward? Where are you?
She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into
-
A perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery
sunlight. HEAR a stream nearby. Bella looks around and finally
sees
-
EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some
trees. He watches her cautiously. She takes a step toward
him, but he holds up a hand. She waits. Finally, he takes
a
deep breath, and steps out of the shade
-
EDWARD
This is why we don't show ourselves
in sunlight..
.
As the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if
embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds. He is magnificent,
shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He
moves toward her.
53.
EDWARD
This is what I am.
He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but..
.
BELLA
You're... beautiful..
.
He realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but
he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again.
EDWARD
(appalled)
Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella.
This is the skin of a killer.
His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again.
BELLA
I don't believe that.
EDWARD
Because you believe the lie. The
camouflage. I'm the world's most
dangerous predator. Everything
about me invites you in - my voice,
my face, even my smell. As if
I
need any of that..
.
He's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by
a
tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands
-
EDWARD
As if you could outrun me. As if
you could fight me off.
He abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against
a
tree trunk with explosive force.
Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable.
EDWARD
I'm designed to kill.
BELLA
I don't care.
EDWARD
I've killed people.
BELLA
It doesn't matter.
54.
EDWARD
I wanted to kill you. I've never
wanted a human's blood so much in
my life. I'm dangerous to you.
BELLA
I trust you.
EDWARD
Don't.
BELLA
I trust you, Edward. I'm here.
She takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch.
She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is
nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone.
BELLA
Edward?
She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow,
catching his breath.
EDWARD
You... took me by surprise.
(collecting himself)
I don't know how to... do this.
He moves back toward her. Slowly.
EDWARD
Me, and my family, we're different
from others of our kind. We're not
nomadic, we have a permanent home.
We only hunt animals. We've
learned to control our thirst..
.
(shaking his head)
But you - your scent, it's like
a
drug to me... my own personal brand
of heroin.
BELLA
(realizing)
Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.
EDWARD
I did. For making me want you so badly.
I'm still not sure I can control myself.
He reaches her again.
BELLA
I know you can.
55.
He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her
face for clues.
EDWARD
I wish I could understand this
thing you see in me. You look at
me with those eyes..
.
(frustrated)
I can't read your mind. Tell me
what you're thinking.
BELLA
I'm afraid.
Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass.
EDWARD
(devastated)
Good.
She sinks down in front of him.
BELLA
Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll
disappear. That I'll lose you.
EDWARD
(amazed, elated)
You don't know how long I've looked
for you.
They share a smile. Then he reaches toward her neck,
pausing..
.
EDWARD
Be very still.
She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand on
her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush
between them is overwhelming. But Bella doesn't move.
He brushes his hand up her cheek. Then lowers it to her
heart... Clouds float past the sun..
.
They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in.
EDWARD
And so the lion fell for the lamb.
BELLA
Stupid lamb.
EDWARD
Sick masochistic lion.
56.
CRANE UP on the two of them, laying together, as close as
they dare... his hand to her heart..
.
DISSOLVE TO:
Edward helps Bella balance-walk across an enormous fallen pine
tree in the moss-covered forest.
BELLA
How long have you been like this?
EDWARD
Since nineteen-eighteen. That's
when Carlisle found me.
She takes that in, it's a lot. But it stokes her curiosity.
BELLA
Where'd he find you?
EDWARD
In a hospital, dying of Spanish
influenza. My parents had already died.
57.
FLASHBACK to CHICAGO HOSPITAL, 1918 - NIGHT
BELLA (V.O.
)
What was it like?
EDWARD (V.O.
)
The word excruciating comes to
mind. But what Carlisle did was
much harder... not many of us have
the restraint to do that.
BELLA (V.O.
)
Didn't he just... bite?
EDWARD
Not just. Our bite contains venom.
And once we taste blood, a sort of..
.
frenzy begins. It's almost
impossible to stop.
BELLA (V.O.
)
But Carlisle did.
EDWARD
First with me, then with his wife,
Esme. He found her in a hospital,
as well. The others followed.
BACK to PRESENT DAY
BELLA
Does someone have to be dying to
become like you?..
.
Their CONVERSATION CONTINUES as we go to
-
They walk along a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks,
covered in bright green moss.
EDWARD
... No, that's just Carlisle. He
would never do... this, to someone
who had another choice.
BELLA
So Carlisle's the reason why you
hunt animals, instead of people.
EDWARD
Not the only reason.
He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion..
.
58.
EDWARD
I don't want to be a monster.
She nods. Understands. He smiles.
EDWARD
We call ourselves vegetarians, by
the way... For our kind, hunting
animals is like living on tofu. It
keeps you strong but isn't very
satisfying.
Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She turns to see him standing
on a large rock in the river.
BELLA
Show off.
EDWARD
It's not that impressive, really.
Anyone in my family can do this.
BELLA
Can they all read minds, too?
EDWARD
No, that's unique to me. But Alice can
see the future.
BELLA
(fishing)
Really? Bet she saw me coming
a
mile away.
She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening.
EDWARD
Her visions are very subjective.
The future can change.
He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and
continuing their walk..
.
Water sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck.
A boom box PLAYS. He perches on top of the roof.
EDWARD
Come to my house tomorrow.
Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off
the cab and sprays in her face. He jumps down from the roof.
BELLA
Your house? With your family?
59.
He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it
and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the
truck's body. She's too flustered to register it.
BELLA
But... what if they don't like me?
EDWARD
(laughing heartily)
You're worried, not because you'll
be in a houseful of vampires, but
because you think they won't
approve of you?
BELLA
I'm glad I amuse you.
But then his laughter dies, as he hears something.
BELLA
What is it?
EDWARD
A complication.
... as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up.
EDWARD
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
He heads to his car, eying the passengers in
-
AERIAL SHOT of the forest as we sweep over its lush green
expanse, to FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast.
The Volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long
serpentine dirt road. FOLLOW THE CAR until, finally, it
reaches a small meadow, in the center of which sits
-
81
A timeless graceful house. The Volvo pulls up and Bella
climbs out, surprised.
BELLA
It's... wonderful.
EDWARD
You expected turrets, dungeons and moats?
BELLA
No... not moats.
He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside.
82
-- Bella backs up to the rail. Edward appears in the
doorway, shifting into a half-crouch, about to pounce.
BELLA
Don't you dare -
Suddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they FLY OFF THE
DECK... then she finds herself
-
IN A TREE - in his arms. When she realizes where she is, she
laughs, delighted. It's infectious, he laughs heartily, too..
.
CUT AWAY TO:
Edward looks Bella in the eye.
EDWARD
Trust me?
BELLA
In theory.
EDWARD
Then close your eyes.
She does, warily. He grips her more firmly, then LEAPS them to
another tree like a flying squirrel! Then, again, to the TOP of
another tree. He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella.
EDWARD
Open.
She does... to the most astonishing bird's eye VIEW of the
valley, river, and the mountains beyond. CAMERA whirls around
them allowing us a 360 degree view of their surroundings. Off
Bella's intoxicated face..
.
CUT AWAY TO:
Jessica pops a volleyball in the air, doing practice serves.
Angela takes a picture of her, then points her camera around,
looking for another shot. Eric studies some fliers
advertising the prom.
JESSICA
Monte Carlo? That's our prom
theme?
ERIC
Gambling, tuxedos and -
-
(ala Sean Connery)
Bond. James -- ow!
-- as Jessica head-butts the ball which hits him in the face.
68.
ANGELA
Oh. My. God.
Angela, scanning for a shot, has frozen. Jessica and Eric
SEE
-
BELLA AND EDWARD
-- arriving together. All eyes on campus are turning to
them, filled with curiosity, jealousy, envy.
BELLA
Everyone's staring.
EDWARD
Not that guy over -- yeah, he just
looked.
Off his rakish, but reassuring smile..
.
89
CLOSE ON A GERMAN SHEPHERD 89
Moving fast, tracking. INCLUDE CHARLIE holding the leash
-
--It's a hunting party, several dogs, half a dozen armed men.
CHARLIE
Guys, we got something
-
The Deputies hurry to Charlie. They gather around
-
Bella hurries toward the entrance, trying to keep the joy on her
face in check... with minimal success. Outside the door, she
passes Mike, hanging out with several of his basketball TEAMMATES.
MIKE
Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen.
She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile,
as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in.
BELLA
Sorry I'm late. Biology project.
Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate
of seafood in front of Bella.
CHARLIE
Ordered you the seafood combo.
BELLA
Order one for yourself next time.
You should cut back on the steak.
CHARLIE
I'm healthy as a horse.
CORA
(concerned)
Say Chief, boys want to know, you
find anything down by Queets River
today?
Charlie's aware of the LOGGERS at the counter listening, too.
He frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm.
CHARLIE
The suspect's moving east. Kitsap
County Sheriff is taking over from
here. They're putting extra guys on.
CORA
Hope they catch him fast.
She moves off, with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella
pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an
easy rhythm now.
CHARLIE
Your friends are flagging you.
70.
She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside,
straws in their noses, making faces at her. She smiles.
CHARLIE
It's okay you wanna join them. I'm
just gonna turn in early anyway.
BELLA
Yeah, me, too.
CHARLIE
It's a Friday night. Go out. The
Newton boy's got a big smile for
you. Nice family, the Newtons.
BELLA
He's just a friend.
CHARLIE
None of the boys in town interest you?
BELLA
We're not really going to talk
about boys, are we?
CHARLIE
Just... you should be around people.
I leave you alone too much.
BELLA
(with genuine affection)
I've never minded being alone. Guess
I'm a lot like my dad that way.
Charlie smiles. These two have come a long way. Cora returns
-
CORA
Berry cobbler, two forks.
She sets it between them. Off them, both reaching for forks..
.
Edward and Bella climb into a massive JEEP parked in the drive.
EDWARD
(amused)
Your father thinks you should go to
an all-girl's school.
BELLA
No fair, reading Charlie's mind.
As they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat
-
BELLA
And since when do vampires like baseball?
EDWARD
It's the American pastime. Plus,
there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the
only time we can play. You'll see why.
Storm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in
the Jeep. She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an
enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks.
Esme and Emmett come to greet Bella.
ESME
Good thing you're here. We need
a
umpire.
EMMETT
(big crooked grin)
She thinks we cheat.
75.
ESME
I know you cheat. Call em as you
see em, Bella.
WHIP PAN to Alice on the Pitcher's Mound.
ALICE
It's time.
-- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest.
BEGIN MONTAGE - THE GAME
And it's extraordinary. Bella stays by Esme who plays
catcher. Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed. Edward
and Emmett take positions in the outfield.
-- ROSALIE SMASHES the ball with the aluminum bat. It CRACKS
like thunder -- and is followed directly by real THUNDER.
BELLA
(to Esme)
Now I get why you need the thunder.
The ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing
through the trees. Edward disappears after it.
BELLA
That has to be a home run.
ESME
Edward's very fast.
Rosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races out
of the forest with the ball and WHIPS it to home plate. WHAP!
Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.
BELLA
Yer out?
Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as DR. CULLEN hits a line
drive. Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet
and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous
boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe!
JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest. But
before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly GASPS.
ALICE
Stop! I didn't see them..
.
They all stop. Edward is immediately at Bella's side. The
family instantly gathers at home plate.
ALICE
They're traveling so quickly
-
76.
ROSALIE
You said they left the county -
-
ALICE
They did, but then they heard us..
.
(looking at Edward)
And changed their minds.
EDWARD
(to Bella)
Put your hair down
-
ROSALIE
Like that'll help. I could smell
her from across the field.
Edward ignores Rosalie as he arranges Bella's hair.
EDWARD
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm so sorry.
She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward -
THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
There's a faint rustle... then James, Victoria and Laurent
emerge. As they near, Bella SEES their bare feet, then the
deep BURGUNDY of their eyes. Laurent holds up the baseball.
LAURENT
I believe this belongs to you.
He tosses the ball (his casual toss is still blindingly fast)
to Dr. Cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely.
DR. CULLEN
Thank you.
LAURENT
Could you use three more players?
DR. CULLEN
Of course.
LAURENT
I'm Laurent. This is Victoria.
And James.
DR. CULLEN
Would you like to bat first?
Laurent picks up a bat. The Cullens take the field. Dr.
Cullen is catcher, Edward is on first, with Bella behind him,
near the Jeep.
77.
Bella sees that Edward's eyes are locked onto James. Laurent
is at bat first.
DR. CULLEN
I'm afraid your hunting activities have
caused something of a mess for us.
LAURENT
Our apologies. We didn't realize
the territory had been claimed.
DR. CULLEN
Yes, we maintain a permanent
residence.
The three newcomers exchange a look of surprise.
LAURENT
Really? Well, we won't be a problem
any more.
VICTORIA
The humans were tracking us, but we
led them East-
Jasper pitches the ball -- Laurent SLAMS it -- but Alice is
up a tree is a flash and the ball slams into Alice's hand
with a THWAP. Laurent is pissed, but James smiles ever so
slightly, delighted at the discovery of worthy opponents.
James is up next and he POWER-SLAMS IT with AMAZING FORCE..
.
He runs past first, past Edward, past Bella..
.
CLOSE ON BELLA -- IN SLOW MOTION as the wind from the ball
ruffles her hair, carrying her scent, which floats to
-
JAMES -- who suddenly SCREECHES to a halt. His head WHIPS
around at her and he lurches into a crouch, his nostrils
flaring, excitedly, eyes locked on Bella.
JAMES
You brought a snack.
EDWARD springs in front of Bella, baring his teeth. A truly
menacing, feral SNARL rips from his throat. James GROWLS back.
OVERHEAD SHOT: in a flash, the Cullens rush into position
behind Edward -- Laurent and Victoria line up behind James.
DR. CULLEN
The girl is with us.
78.
LAURENT
(trying to defuse
situation)
We won't harm her.
EMMETT
(hungry for battle)
Just try it.
DR. CULLEN
I think it best if you leave.
LAURENT
Yes, I can see the game is over.
We'll go now. James?
But James' eyes don't leave Edward's. Laurent puts a hand on
James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the woods with
his cohorts, disappearing. Once they're gone, Esme
immediately gathers up the bats-
-
DR. CULLEN
Get Bella out of here. We'll follow
them.
Dr. Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the
three vampires. Edward scoops Bella up as we
-
SMASH TO:
Edward whips Bella into the Jeep and straps her in -
-
EDWARD
James is a tracker. I saw his mind.
The hunt is his obsession, and my
reaction set him off -
-
-- The tires spin as Edward WHIPS the jeep around
-
EDWARD
-- We're a large clan of strong fighters
all protecting one vulnerable human.
(dark with disgust)
I just made this his most exciting
game ever.
Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just
wrought up on them all as..
.
THE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD
A jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until
they reach
-
79.
THE JEEP speeds wildly down the road.
EDWARD
The first place he'll go is your
house. He'll track your scent
there.
BELLA
(horrified)
What?!? Charlie's there. He's in
danger because of me. Because of
us!
EDWARD
(calmly)
Then we'll lead the tracker away
from him. Somehow.
He angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING
-
Bella exits, heads to her truck. Fresh tears spring to her
eyes.
ANGLE ON THE WOODS
Trees, branches... and a pair of DEADLY EYES. James. He watches
from a distance as Bella pulls out. The truck moves off... and
so does James, leaving Charlie alone with his pain, staring out
the window.
The small, insulated town passes by in SLOW MOTION... INSIDE we
SEE Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela laughing, flirting, innocent,
hopeful..
.
Edward, Emmett and Alice rush Bella from the truck to the
house... but freeze when the door opens and Laurent exits. They
immediately take defensive positions but Dr. Cullen appears.
DR. CULLEN
He came to warn us. About James.
They back down slightly. Laurent address Dr. Cullen.
LAURENT
I've grown tired of his games. But
he's got unparalleled senses.
Absolutely lethal. I've never seen
anything like him in three hundred
years ... And the woman, Victoria,
will back him. Don't underestimate
her.
83.
Dr. Cullen nods thanks. Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic.
LAURENT
I'm truly sorry for what's been
unleashed here.
And he moves off, disappearing into the woods..
.
The sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black
MERCEDES SEDAN with dark tinted windows BLASTS through frame
-
TREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward,
Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through
the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead.
Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie
tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING
MAPLE TREE. And then they're gone.
111 OMITTED 111
Esme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the
river. In the distance, below, they SEE
-
THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view. She then looks
in their direction. Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has
their scent, they continue over the hill's crest.
113 OMITTED 113
86.
James blasts past the FLOWERING MAPLE -- then stops, backtracks to
the tree, finds the tiny swatch of fabric. He starts off again..
.
but stops, smells the fabric. Something's not right. He runs
back in the opposite direction... Uh oh..
.
SMASH TO:
Dr. Cullen drives the Jeep, fast, Emmett in the back, Edward in
the passenger seat on his cell phone.
EDWARD
I'm coming to get you.
(hates having to say
this)
We lost the tracker. The woman is
still in the area. Rosalie and
Esme are protecting your father.
BELLA
(sinking)
This is my fault. You warned me,
but I didn't think. I just..
.
EDWARD
Bella, we're in too deep. We can't
change how we feel..
.
BELLA
No... we can't.
(then)
When will you get here?
EDWARD
In a couple hours. Then you and
I
will go somewhere. Together. The
others will keep hunting.
(then, determined)
Bella, I swear to you, I'll do whatever
it takes to make you safe again.
Off Bella, her eyes welling..
.
SEE Alice in the lobby, settling the bill. Jasper loads up
the car out front.
Bella walks through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice.
She spots them outside under the porte cacher, loading the
Mercedes, deep in a heated discussion. She slips out the
opposite door, rushes toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the
door. The DRIVER is an elderly woman with a hacking COUGH.
BELLA
(taking a breath for
courage)
8th and Palo Verde, please.
The taxi pulls out. Bella watches the hotel disappear. Off
her FACE IN THE REAR WINDOW..
.
91.
BELLA (V.O.
)
I've never given much thought to
how I would die..
.
Once again, we see the polished malls, the manicured cactus
gardens. All empty for the night.
BELLA (V.O.
)
But dying in the place of someone
I
love seems like a good way to go..
.

Bella climbs out of the taxi. It pulls away, leaving her on the
curb facing the deserted building. Bella twirls her mother's
ring around her finger, then reaches for the pepper spray.
BELLA (V.O.
)
I can't bring myself to regret the
decisions that brought me face to
face with death... they also
brought me to Edward.
She slips the pepper spray into her jeans pocket. She wraps
her purse strap around her wrist. She takes a breath,
approaches the school. Peers in the windows. The blinds are
drawn. But from inside, we HEAR a faint sound..
.
RENE (O.S.
)
Bella? Bella?
It's time. Bella goes to the front door. It's unlocked.
132 OMITTED 132
An AERIAL SWEEP over the lush green forests. We're back in
the misty, damp beauty of the Pacific Northwest..
.
100.
At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife.
Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant
suit. But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare. The
front door opens and they look up to see
-
BELLA --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress. Edward
is enchanted. Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to
her LEG CAST. Charlie edges out Edward to help her down.
BELLA
Alice lent me the dress. It was the
only thing that would fit over my
cast. Is it too...
?
EDWARD
You're perfect... I'll take good
care of her, Chief.
CHARLIE
Heard that before.
Edward moves to open the car door. Charlie holds Bella back.
CHARLIE
(sotto)
I put new pepper spray in your bag.
BELLA
Dad.
CHARLIE
... and... you look beautiful.
Father and daughter share a smile..
.
Edward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn. He helps Bella
out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining
room. Mr. Molina and other teachers are there. We may
notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones.
BELLA
I can't believe you're making me do
this.
He just grins. Edward guides her around a corner to..
.
THE PROM - Monte Carlo style. Gaming tables and roulette
wheels. Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes,
dance and socialize.
101.
BELLA
You really are trying to kill me.
EDWARD
Prom is an important rite of
passage. I don't want you to miss
anything.
She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately.
They continue into the prom. Several heads turn. Bella sees
-
THE DANCE FLOOR, where a gap has formed. In the middle, two
couples whirl gracefully. It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and
Emmett, looking absolutely stunning.
Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury. But
Alice waves brightly. Bella returns it with a smile as we
hear a crossfade into the next track-
BELLA'S POV -- THE DJ BOOTH
-
It's Eric at the turntables, making the room bounce! Next to
him, Angela wears the headphones, flipping through a stack of
vinyl. They nod at Bella -- she shoots them a smile when -
-
A FLASHBULB gets her attention
-
BELLA'S POV - PHOTOGRAPHER'S STATION
Mike and Jessica stand in front of an Aston Martin cut-out.
Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond
impersonation. Jessica poses like Pussy Galore.
Edward smirks, then turns to Bella
-
EDWARD
Shall we?
BELLA
(laughs, then realizes)
You're serious.
He doesn't wait for an answer, more or less CARRIES her to
the DANCE FLOOR -- then places her feet atop his own... and
starts to move. She actually begins to enjoy it.
EDWARD
See? You're dancing.
BELLA
At prom.
As they dance, she feels his grace, his strength. Becomes
thoughtful. Finally, she looks at him.
102.
BELLA
Edward... why did you save me?
(off his questioning look)
If you'd let the venom spread,
I could've been like you by now.
EDWARD
(stops, horrified)
You don't know what you're saying.
You don't want this.
BELLA
I want you. Always.
EDWARD
(angry)
I won't end your life for you.
He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the last word.
BELLA
I'm dying anyway. Every minute,
I get closer, older
EDWARD
That's how it's supposed to happen.
BELLA
Not the way Alice saw it.
(off his sharp look)
I heard her. She saw me like you.
EDWARD
Her visions change, Bella.
BELLA
Based on what someone decides. And
I've decided.
He looks at her, angry.
EDWARD
Is that what you dream about?
Becoming a monster?
BELLA
I dream about being with you forever.
EDWARD
You really want this?
BELLA
Yes.
He lowers his lips to her neck. One bite is all it would take.
103.
EDWARD
You're ready right now?
BELLA
Yes.
His lips hover over her skin, a long beat... then he presses his
lips to her throat. Not a bite. A kiss. He looks at her.
EDWARD
You're going to have a long and
happy life with me. Isn't that
enough?
She looks at him... and finally smiles.
BELLA
For now.
They WHIRL around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from
one another, as we CRANE UP on them, in each other's arms..
.
BELLA (V.O.)
No one will surrender tonight. But
I won't give in. I know what I want.
CONTINUE UP AND BACK on the dance floor. We realize ..
... someone's watching it, looking down from the window of
a second floor hotel room in the Inn. The MUSIC wafting up in
echoes. PULL BACK to REVEAL..
VICTORIA, turning from the window. She's stylishly dressed
now, but seething -- a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her
throat. PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES
filled with vengeance as we
