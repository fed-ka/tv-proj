The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens.
Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end-
less marsh.
It is fall, the first frost not far away and
the foliage is brown and bare.
With the red-orange ball
of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first
appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the
mire.
The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man.
He is very well-dressed in a dark suit.
A .22 caliber
gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand.
His name is ROBERT RATH.
The other man is WILLIE KETCHAM.
He is also wearing a
very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the
brambles and mud.
As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the
mud.
KETCHAM
Aw-shit!
He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in
the air.
He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud.
He looks at Rath.
KETCHAM
How much farther?
RATH
Just a little ways.
Up to those
trees.
About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there
is a small cluster of trees.
KETCHAM
Oh, fuck it.
He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud.
He smiles.
It feels good.
He hurls the sock.
Lifting
his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.
He
grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off,
laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud.
Rath waits, a faint smile.
He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging
both feet into the dark, wet earth.
KETCHAM
Hey, this feels kinda good.
They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet
deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE.
KETCHAM
Hey, do you mind if I talk a
little?
I feel like, I don't
know, talking I guess.
RATH
Sure.
KETCHAM
Funny, I've never been a talker.
My wife was always getting on me
about that.
'Say what you feel,
tell me what's bothering you,
you ve got to talk to me.'
I
never would though.
Not really.
RATH
Why not?
KETCHAM
I don't know.
Part of me wanted
to but part of me always said,
'What's she going to be able to
do?'
I don't know.
Maybe I
didn't trust her.
He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a
snowball.
KETCHAM
My Margaret... I loved her but you
know what?
I cheated on her.
All
the time.
I don't even know why.
It wasn't the sex, Margaret was
great in bed.
I think if I wasn't
married I wouldn't have even looked
at some of those women.
I knew she
couldn't trust me, so how could I
trust her?
If she was here right
now I'd think that I would tell her
that I was sorry... 'course, if she
were here right now, maybe I
wouldn't feel like talking.
He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are
too far.
KETCHAM
I think I've heard of you.
RATH
It's possible.
KETCHAM
You're pretty famous aren't you?
RATH
I hope not.
KETCHAM
I know this may seem like a strange
question, but can I ask you how
much the contract was for -- not
to insult you or anything, I know
you're a professional, but just
for me, I was just wondering.
RATH
It's a common question.
KETCHAM
Oh yeah?
I guess we still need to
see that price tag.
Like art,
right?
You hang some painting
that looks like baby-puke in your
living room only if it costs a
bundle.
RATH
A dime.
KETCHAM
One hundred thousand?
That's it?
Jesus... Is that a lot?
RATH
Average.
KETCHAM
Shit... oh well.
Ketcham laughs.
KETCHAM
I have been thinking about this
for a long while.
I knew this day
was coming.
I knew someday
someone would make the call on me.
I never thought about anyone that
I had whacked.
What do you call
it anyway?
RATH
Taken.
KETCHAM
'Taken.'
That's nice.
When I had
someone taken I would call our
General Contractor, transfer the
money and as soon as I hung up the
phone I forgot about them.
RATH
Everyone who plays the game knows
the rules.
KETCHAM
That's exactly what I told myself.
Ketcham laughs again.
He is getting kind of giggly, like
he's high.
KETCHAM
I always wondered what I'd be
thinking at this exact moment.
I
imagined that I would be thinking
about the fucker who contracted
this, trying to figure out who
it was...
Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath.
RATH
Don't know.
That's how it works.
KETCHAM
That's what our General Contractor
told us but how can you trust
someone like that?
RATH
Right.
KETCHAM
I thought that I would be thinking
about Margaret, or work, or that
I'd be having these deep, profound
and depressing thoughts but I'm
not.
I'm trying to think really
profound thoughts, but I can't.
It seems very funny to me.
RATH
What are you thinking about?
KETCHAM
I'm thinking about Moonpies.
Ain't
that funny?
I haven't had a
Moonpie since I was ten years old.
Right now, I'm thinking how much
I'd love one.
RATH
And an R.C.
He's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him.
Ketcham suddenly
stops laughing.
They are nearly to the cluster of trees.
KETCHAM
Can I ask you something?
RATH
Go ahead.
KETCHAM
What do other guys do?
He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND.
RATH
Everyone handles it differently.
Some are ready, some are not.
KETCHAM
Do they get down on their knees,
begging and crying?
RATH
Some.
KETCHAM
When I thought about this, that
was always there, in the back of
my head, that image of me on my
knees, crying.
It wouldn't go
away and it would really upset me.
It was something that I could never
get away from... but now, I feel
it's okay.
I feel good.
RATH
Can I ask you a question?
KETCHAM
Anything.
RATH
Why didn't you fade?
KETCHAM
You mean quit?
RATH
Yeah.
KETCHAM
I used to think about it.
I had
Margaret.
She wanted kids.
I
thought about moving somewhere
far away like, Europe.
I could
see all of that, the first part,
the getting away but I couldn't
see that next part.
'Then what?'
So I'd stop thinking about it and
go back to work.
You understand?
RATH
Yeah.
Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch
trees.
KETCHAM
I always pictured that I would end
in some land fill, under
someone else's garbage.
I kept
picturing those plastic diapers
filled with some baby's green shit,
covering me.
But this is nice...
He looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black
horizon.
KETCHAM
Look at that.
I haven't watched
the sun set in a million years.
Do you mind?
RATH
No.
Ketcham stares at the last of the light.
KETCHAM
Nice... real nice.
With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry.
Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun.
Rath
looks down at the gun limply held in his hand.
When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark-
ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY
FALLING INTO THE MUD.
After a beat we hear TWO MORE
SHOTS.
Ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud,
a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze
left by the dying sun.
Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand-
ing alone in the middle of nowhere.
A red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian
restaurant.
Across the street from Trattoria Roma, Rath jacks together
a German assault rifle with night scope.
THROUGH the NIGHT SCOPE we see the front door to the
restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped
together slowly back out.
The group moves toward the street.
BAIN
Now run!
Like dogs out of the gate, they bolt.
A chunk of BRICK EXPLODES from the wall just behind Bain's
head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the
curb.
He laughs.
We get the idea that Bain is enjoying
this.
Bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars,
staying low and out of sight.
He works his way up to a black Mercedes that is parked
illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys.
He hits the remote unlocking the doors.
Just as Bain starts to open the door, the front TIRE
EXPLODES.
Another second, the back TIRE EXPLODES.
BAIN
Fuck!
Bain hears the growing wail of POLICE SIRENS.
Thinking
for a moment, he opens the car door and pulls a long
handled switchblade and a roll of electrician's tape from
the glove compartment.
Bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls
his shirt sleeve down.
From his pocket he takes out a
Gameboy and begins playing "Tetris."
The CARS SCREECH to a halt in front of the restaurant.
The COPS jump out, drawing their weapons.
Bain throws his guns down, raising his hands in the air.
BAIN
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I give
up!
More CARS come SCREECHING up as the two officers hold
their beads on Bain.
COP
Hit the ground!
Face down!
Spread
your legs!
Bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him,
frisking him.
In this position the Cop is unable to find
the knife strapped to Bain's forearm, but finds the
Gameboy.
BAIN
Hey, don't touch that!
COP
Shut up!
The Cop twists Bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing
him tightly.
They drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and
paramedics in the street.
Rath's car races down the street trying to catch up with
the patrol car.
Orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned
patrol car.
Oil black clouds billow into the night sky.
Rath's car cruises past.
Rath sees the back seat window shattered, kicked out.
Bain is gone.
RATH
I'm not done yet.
A brand new cab is sitting at a red light.
The cabby looks into the rearview mirror, as a pair of
headlights roll up behind him.
The car gets closer, the
lights brighter; they don't stop.
He shrieks as the CAR SMASHES INTO HIS, TEARING OFF HIS
BUMPER.
The cabby jumps out, rattling off a string of obscenities.
Rath gets out of the white car, starting to apologize, as
the cabby moves toward him.
When he's close enough, Rath decks him, knocking him
unconscious.
He picks him up and puts him in the white car.
Rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to
green, he drives off.
It is a deserted intersection.
The buildings are dark and
some of the street lights are out.
The cab sits by itself, ENGINE RUNNING, its taillights
glowing through the exhaust.
A large six flat leans out from a hill in San Francisco.
There is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches
down, heat rising off the tarmac.
The five men stride through the automated terminal doors
and towards a waiting limousine.
Further down, Rath, now wearing a black T-shirt and jeans,
exits and hails a cab.
The limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway.
The cab pulls in behind it.
Electra's black CAR ROARS out of the garage, onto the open
street.
Electra's car is parked out front.
She unlocks the lobby door and drags herself inside.
The door opens and Electra jumps out, slamming it behind
her as --
Bain turns from the back stairs.
She leaps back inside as he whips out his GUN, PUMPING TWO
HOLES in the door.
Bain leaps down the flights.
Bain rushes into the street, looking in every direction.
They are gone.
BAIN
Fuck me!
Somewhere in the city.
The plane lands.
Rath and Electra hand their bags to a CABBY who puts them
in his trunk.
The cab pulls up in front of a large, brand new glass
hotel, which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the
gulf water.
Rath is upset.
RATH
(in Spanish)
No, no.
I said the Hotel Paraiso.
CABBY
(in Spanish)
Yes.
This is the Hotel Paraiso.
RATH
(in Spanish)
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the
city.
Near the Plaza del Sol.
CABBY
(in Spanish)
I'm sorry, sir.
A year ago there
was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso.
This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
RATH
(in Spanish)
Take us there.
American tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but
much of the out-lying city is very poor.
The old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk.
The
face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang
in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of
the building rather than the building itself.
Rath stares at it, remembering.
Electra is behind him, standing in the midst of the Plaza
del Sol.
He looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directly
opposite of that.
The International Banco de Mexico, an enormous, beautiful
old building; its exterior walls are white-washed
concrete, blindingly bright white.
Electra looks at the bank and smiles.
ELECTRA
So, that's where all that S & L
money is?
Rath is not listening to her.
He is somewhere else.
He
turns back to the fourth story window.
RATH
That's where he'll be.
ELECTRA
What?
RATH
I wasn't expecting this.
I need to
think.
Beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to
midnight oil.
Electra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the
warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea.
Rath stands in the shadow of the door frame.
RATH
Breakfast.
ELECTRA
Why don't you bring it out here?
It's beautiful out here.
Rath steps a little farther out.
He looks down either
side of the building, checking sight lines.
He looks out
and sees another hotel with windows facing them.
He turns to her.
Says nothing.
Moves back inside.
Bain moves through the market, booths lining the edges of
the plaza.
His eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses.
He buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the
plaza.
He looks at the bank, at the military-style security
guards that patrol the front.
He turns in the plaza, checking the perimeter, his gaze
falling on the tall, burned-out building.
He looks back at the bank, imagining the sight line.
He bites into the apricot, its juice gushing, running down
his chin.
The sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows
of the hotel.
We are MOVING DOWN the street, LOW, OVER the old
flagstones, TOWARDS the marble statue that Bain shot.
On the ground are the shattered pieces of the head.
CLOSER
We see one of the pieces is part of the face, the eyes,
which seem like the iris-less eyes of a chess king.
CLOSER
We MOVE INTO the blank white of that eye.
DISSOLVE TO:
WHITE SQUARE GLOSSED WITH LIGHT
We PULL BACK, RISING UP and AWAY, and see other squares,
black and white like a chess board.
A woman's HIGH HEELS CLICK past.
RISING HIGHER, we see the woman walking.
A man crosses
behind her, in another direction.
HIGHER STILL, and we realize that we are looking at the
black and white marble floor of the --
The cafe is off the plaza.
Electra sits at a patio table.
Down the street she can
see the back of the burned-out hotel.
She hears Rath in her ear-piece.
RATH (V.O.)
All right.
I'm in the bank.
He'll
move now.
How are you doing?
She is nervous.
ELECTRA
I'm ready.
Electra smiles when she hears him, mouthing the name
"Martin."
Electra looks up over her book and Bain is there, moving
down the side street, gliding through the crowd with the
menacing indifference of a shark.
Electra watches as Bain moves along the plywood wall,
covered with bills and posters, built to keep people out
of the burned hotel.
He is carrying a long nylon duffel
bag.
At the corner, a section of the plywood has been pulled
loose and Bain squeezes through, into the hotel.
ELECTRA
He's inside.
Electra is sipping at some iced tea, dizzy at the thought
of all that money.
ELECTRA
Ten million dollars, sitting there.
Waiting... this is insane.
The shadows are getting longer.
Electra is watching the back of the hotel, when Bain
emerges from the shadows.
ELECTRA
Oh my God.
He is moving like a bullet, knocking into people who don't
get out of his way.
ELECTRA
He's coming.
Electra smiles.
ELECTRA
Was nice.
RATH
Yes.
She sees Bain storming up the stairs.
She stands, tosses
several bills on the table and leaves.
In long, pounding strides, Bain crosses the square,
twisting, glancing back, watching.
Bain nears the opening in the plywood wall.
The sun has begun to set and the entire plaza has a deep
orange and auburn cast.
Rath looks down at the descending, white, stone steps.
He steps down to the first stair.
Rath looks across the square, up the side of the hotel, at
the window; there is only black shadow.
He knows it is over.
Rath hears BAIN SCREAM.
RATH
Electra.
His eyes, his whole body comes to life.
Rath races wildly across the darkening market square.
The sun is gone, the market is closing, the crowd drifting
from the plaza.
A man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley
beside the boarded hotel.
Although they walk a bit slow,
leaning on one another, they become it seems, like just
another couple, arm in arm, holding tightly to each other
and to a very large suitcase.
FADE OUT.
