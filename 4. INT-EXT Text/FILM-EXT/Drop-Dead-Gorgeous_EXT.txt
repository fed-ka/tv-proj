A HAPPY FAMILY raises the AMERICAN FLAG.
BURLY GUYS look up from washing a FORD TRUCK.
Sign next to it reads: "Welcome to Mount Rose, Home of
Freda Klinghagen, Minnesota's Oldest Living Lutheran"
complete with a photo of the extremely old woman smiling
and waving.
An ELDERLY COUPLE looks in the passenger window of the
van.
ELDERLY MAN (MAYOR)
Oh, yah-sure, Freda, yah.
She was the
oldest livin' Lutheran.
Now she's
dead as a doornail.
It's them damn
Shriners who ain't taken that Goddamn

I tells kem, I tells kem every goddamn
year, "Take the Goddamn Freda sign

SUPER: MAYOR OF MOUNT ROSE
Two BOYS play basketball in the driveway of their home.
SMALL CHILDREN in bathing suits play on a lawn.
A boy
shoots his water pistol.
In the vast, already full parking lot, we see Gladys
Leeman's station wagon searching for a parking spot.
IRIS
Oh, there's a parking space over
there.
Oh, no, that's just a compact.
Sorry.
GLADYS
You'd think they'd build the parking
lot of America to go with the Mall of
America!
Gladys pulls into a HANDICAPPED SPOT.
Servettes and
CAMERA stand outside the car.
Iris points at the sign.
IRIS
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
GLADYS
I said I'd move if a cripple came.
Let's just run in the store and pick
out some outfits.
IRIS
All right, let's go.
Iris and another Servette start to get out of the car.
GLADYS
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait!
I just thought of the theme.
Iris and the Servette stop.
IRIS
Oh!
What is it?
GLADYS (cont'd)
"Proud...to be...an...American."
Servettes react with pleasure.
JUMP CUT TO:
Amber tap dances at the side of the road as traffic
passes.
AMBER (V.O.)
I'm lucky I have an after-school job
where I can practice my talent.
GLADYS
Oh, yeah, sure.
You know, every
pageant is special, but this one is
extra-special to me.
When I was
seventeen, I don't know if you know
this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's
American Teen Princess.
And this
year...drum roll please, my lovely
daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is
competin'.

DOCUMENTARIAN (V.O.)
Would you say you have a good chance
to win this pageant?
SUPER: CONTESTANT #9, TAMMY CURRY
TAMMY (V.O.)
Yeah, you bet I do.
I mean, maybe
other people think I can't win a
beauty pageant.
But other people
didn't think I could beat out Becky
Leeman for President of the gun club,
either.
And I did.
I-I-It's just
like Anthony Robbins says, "I'm a
winner.
Nobody can stop me but me!"
KABLOOM!

If I was a betting woman, and
there was a line on this in Vegas, I'd
lay down ten-to-one that it all comes
down to Amber Atkins and Becky Leeman.
Oh, sweet Jesus, what a showdown this
could be if Cain and Abel...
The SOUND RECORDIST enters and Lisa spins out of control,
taking him out.
She leans over and comforts him.

Ow!
Oh, God.
It's so em-so

SUPER: JUDGE #1, JOHN DOUGH
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
So you've, uh, you've judged a lot of
pageants over the years?
JOHN
Nope.
No.
Uh-uh.
Never judged a
pageant before in my life.
Nope.
No
way.
Never around young girls.
Even
if I was, why would I wanna be,
y'know?
I-I-I don't get off on that
kinda thing and that's really why
you're askin', right?
S-someone say

SUPER: JUDGE #2, HAROLD VILMES
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
Do you judge the pageant every year?
HAROLD

Never judged nothin' afore --
HANK

Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Are we on "Cops?"
HAROLD
Shut up, Hank.
This here's business.
Harold CUFFS Hank.
HANK
Ow, Harold - Mom said not the head.
HAROLD
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly
trap.
HANK
I will if you shut your piehole.
HAROLD
Don't make me kick-ya where the good
Lord split-ya.
Harold raises his hand, Hank FLINCHES and
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
So are you excited?
HAROLD
...Oh you betcha!
We're happier than
the day Hanky got acquitted.
I get
made a judge, then the furniture store
hires us to paint the whole damn
thing.
(removing cap)
We're gonna use the money to get our
mamma a proper headstone.
Oh, and
move her out to the cemetery.
Suddenly, Hank runs full speed into the window.
BAM!
He
falls to the ground inside.
REHEARSAL MONTAGE BEGINS OVER MUSIC.
Contestants run out the side door as if running on stage.
Tess Weinhaus trips and falls, causing a chain reaction.
Now contestants run out carrying small wooden step
ladders.
As they reach the CHORUS LINE, they set the
ladder down and LEAP FROG over.
SUPER: FIRST DANCE REHEARSAL - 1 WEEK BEFORE PAGEANT
CHLORIS
Four, five, six, seven.
And one.
Tess runs out, sets her ladder down, jumps and hits mid-
crotch.
She then slides painfully down to the ground.
CHLORIS (cont'd)
Put that chair away!
Get it!
Come

Get it!
Amber TWIRLS perfectly.
CHLORIS (cont'd)
All right.

against his car, smoking and holding a video camera at
his side.
PAN DOWN row doing a seated chorus line on ladders.
Most

Amber and Becky look great.
Tess sits on the
grass with a bag of ice on her crotch.
On John Dough, beside his car.
JOHN
I'm just out here watching the young
girls - contestants - like the rest of
my friends and neighbors...
John quickly turns and starts to pry the hood open.
ANGLE ON
Pat and Brett watch the girls.
Pat admires Amber's
moves.
PAT
(re: Amber)
Are you gettin' her?
Uh, the third
one, the blonde one.
BRETT
Hey.
PAT
See?
Right over there.
Right over
there.
Brett slaps Pat on the back.
BRETT
Leave him alone, leave him alone.
It's okay.
John, his car hood open, is caught aiming his video
camera at the girls performing a dance.
They wear
partially constructed U.S. Monument Headdresses.
JOHN
Oh, this is just a...camera.
I keep
it in the glove compartment for car
accidents.
Insurance... You guys got
a camera and no one's accusin' you of
anything, right?
From the CREW VAN we pass the crappy trailer homes that
are off the Highway.
(Patsy Cline's "King Of The Road"
PLAYS on the radio).
Camera approaches the trailer.
SIGN on the door reads
"Annette's Family Hair Care."
Inside, the kitchen has been turned into a mini hair
salon.
Annette gives Loretta, neighbor, mid-50's - a
bouffant.
LORETTA
What do you mean, they take out her
butt?
ANNETTE
(seeing camera in window)
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
LORETTA
Are we on "Cops" again?
ANNETTE
You could be quiet.
LORETTA
Hi.
ANNETTE
Hi.
JUMP CUT TO:
Loretta holds onto the door frame so Annette can't push
her out.
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
What makes you think that Becky's
going to win?
LORETTA
Why do I think Becky'll win?
You're
talkin'...
(to Annette)
Don't pinch!.
(back into camera)
You're talkin' kbout the richest
family in a small town.
It's front
page news when one of kem takes a
shit.
(she laughs hard)
Can one of yous boys give me a ride
home?
ANNETTE
Don't fall for it.
She lives two
trailers down.
LORETTA
So?
Be real easy.
ANNETTE
Go on home, Loretta.
Come on.
Go on,
the party's over.
LORETTA
Anyone?
Becky thumbs bullets into a 12-gauge pump shotgun.
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
So you know, Brett just got shot in
the head.
BECKY
(cool as a cucumber)
He did?
Well, huntin's
dangerous...So, anyways, my mom gave
me this 30-aught for my sixteenth
birthday...
TWIN OFFICERS lean against their car.
One prepares to
pack some snuff.
TWIN OFFICER #1
Oh-yah, helluva way to go, there.
After some extensive investigation, we
figure the Curry girl musta been
drivin' and smokin' and KABLEWEY!
TWIN OFFICER #2
(holding a Skoal tin)
Not enough left of her to fill a tin.
He puts a pinch between his cheek and gum.
Amber drives fast and furious as we come to what's left
of her trailer.
All the NEIGHBORS are out drinkin'
beers, eatin' food and watchin' the excitement.
AMBER
Oh my God - no!
Is my mom okay?
Was
she home?
Hearse SCREECHES to a halt.
We hear a THUD, then MOANS
from in back.
Amber jumps out.
Camera follows, a la
"COPS."
It's pandemonium with fire trucks, neighbors, an
ambulance, etc.
AMBER (cont'd)
Mom!
Mom!?
MOMMMM!
Loretta runs up to Amber as TWO FIREMEN approach.
FIREMAN #1
You family?
LORETTA
No, she's just screamin' "Mom, Mom!"
kcause she's got Tourettes... She's
Annette's kid, dipshit.
AMBER
(to Loretta)
Is Mom okay?
LORETTA
She's alive, sweetie.
AMBER
Where is she?!
LORETTA
She's right over there.
Camera pans over to see a semi-conscious Annette as they
load her stretcher into the ambulance, shut the doors and
start to pull away.
Amber runs after them.
AMBER
Mommmm!
I'll be right behind you in
the hearse!
LORETTA
Don't let that worry you, Annette!

ROCKER KIDS
SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!
The twin officers lean against their car.
TWIN OFFICER #1
The Atkins fire?
Foul play?
Shit-no.
After some thorough investigatin', we
determined it musta been a bad wirin'.
Mosta them trailer-folk plug a TV,
VCR, crock pot and Fry-daddy into one
outlet and don't think nothin' of it
ktil KABLEWEY!
TWIN OFFICER #2
(taking a pinch of Skoal)
Not enough left to fill a tin.
Follow the contestants up to the door.
A very shaken Amber paces.
AMBER
Don't you get it?
I was supposed to
go first.
I was contestant number
one.
That light was meant for my
head.
If Janelle hadn't wanted to
change numbers... God, I owe my life
to that deaf baby.
Loretta enters, portable phone and drink in hand.
LORETTA
That was your mom.
She wanted you to
have this.
AMBER
(taking drink)
Really, Loretta?
LORETTA
(avoiding eye contact)
You-betcha.
AMBER
My mom wanted me to have this?
LORETTA
Oh, shut up.
I thought it might help
you get some sleep.
AMBER
Loretta, never have kids.
LORETTA
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still
could.
Loretta pulls a bag out of a closet and hands it to
Amber.
LORETTA (cont'd)
Here, your ma did want you to have
this since your other one got toasted
and all.
Amber pulls out an ELEGANT GREEN GOWN.
AMBER
Oh...my...God!
It's just like Diane
Sawyer's!
kCourse it's not a size
ten, Diane was a little hippy back
then.
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
She hugs Loretta.
SUPER: NIGHT OF THE PAGEANT

Behind them Leslie Miller's boyfriend, PAT, and a group
of ROWDY GUYS approach.
PAT
Whooo!
Leslie kicks Teen Princess
ass!
Go Muskies!
Contestants, in "physical fitness" outfits, wait outside
the double doors, holding freshly painted red, white and
blue step ladders.
Becky and Amber stare at each other
from opposite ends of the line.
IRIS
All right, why don't we take up the
stepladders, all right?
For the
Physical Fitness number?
BECKY
(picking up her stool)
They're wet.
LISA
Hey, my hands are stuck.
MOLLY
(sniffing)
Uh, I'm kinda dizzy from the fumes.
IRIS
Well, hold kem away from you so it
doesn't get on the outfits.
(turning to Servettes)
What kinda mental retard paints step
ladders the morning of a pageant.
ON STAGE
Hank is being pulled off stage by Harold.
Gladys adjusts
her dress, frazzled.
HANK

Here come the judge - pinch, pinch -

Get back, you total retard!
LORETTA

GLADYS
I'm okay, I'm okay - dress is fine.
I'm okay...well, our other judges are
Jean Kangas and John Dough...
Iris and Servettes go in the gym as Chloris Klinghagen
comes out.
CHLORIS
(loud whisper)
Opening number looked, uh, good.
Solid.
But now you're gonna have to
actually dance, so...
(holds up jar of Vaseline)
Here.
Put a dab of this on the old
choppers, ladies.
It'll help you
smile.
And when they're lookin' at
your teeth - God willin' - they won't
be lookin at your feet.
Chloris gives Amber the jar and exits.
From the gym, we
hear TAPED PATRIOTIC MUSIC.
Contestants CHEER and run
in.
"PHYSICAL FITNESS" ROUTINE - PATRIOTIC MUSIC
As cuts of patriotic dance moves progress, the girls have
more and more red, white and blue paint smeared on their
clothes, arms and legs.
Amber's clearly the best.
Taped music ENDS.
Contestants, covered with paint,
strike a final pose - sitting on ladders, standing,
kneeling.
Applause.
BACKSTAGE - WALKWAY
Contestants wait anxiously as they pass a can of
TURPENTINE and a RAG to remove paint from their arms and
legs.
BECKY
Hurry up.
LESLIE
Okay, guys, I think we all got some.
You just take it off.
AMBER
Here, I didn't get any.
LESLIE
Here, have some.
MICHELLE
Hand me another white one.
LISA
Listen, you guys, don't go int the
bathroom.
Tess blew chunks all over.
Man, she ate a big dinner.
BECKY
Maybe she shoulda shoved that lucky
bolt down her throat for desert.
Becky storms off.
AMBER
(sotto, to other girls)
And the winner of the "Spirit" award
goes to...
Girls laugh quietly.
Iris pulls a dazed and confused
Tess - beg wet spot on her shirt - through the shot.
AMBULANCE pulls up.
Mary Johanson, unconscious, slumped
in wheelchair, is brought out and put in.
Amber and
Loretta wheel Annette out.
Paramedics put her in, too.
ANNETTE
We was robbed.
LORETTA
Okay.
Take her purse.
AMBER
Bye mom.
ANNETTE
We was robbed.
AMBER
It's okay.
JUMP CUT TO:
Amber faces camera as ambulance pulls away.
AMBER
Oh, Mom's okay.
They're just givin'
her a ride back.
She almost blew
outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on
the way over.
LORETTA
Thank God for bunge cords.
JUMP CUT TO:
AMBER
(tearing up)
...Yah-well, at least, y'know, I got

Loretta puts her arm around Amber.
They walk off as
Leslie and Pat approach.
LESLIE
Hey-hey, I'm Second Runner-up!
Whooo!
I got second place!
PAT
Third.
LESLIE
Huh?
Lisa passes by with her parents.
They look pissed.
LISA
No, it was worth it.
Amber shoulda
won.
LISA'S FATHER
I'll tell ya one thing.
Peter never
woulda pulled a shenanigan like that.
LISA
Well, y'know what, dad?
Y'know what?
Peter's gay!
She runs off.
Her parents stop DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS.
LISA'S FATHER
What?!
DISSOLVE TO:
Entire town lines the road.
The Mayor and the Leman
family stand behind the red ribbon.
Parade PARTICIPANTS
are lined up behind them.
MAYOR
(into bullhorn)
Yah-hello-hello...shit!
How the fuck
do ya work this damn thing, huh?
Oh.
Welcome to our first ever American
Teen Princess Parade - which also
happens to be the unveiling of our new
sewer system!
CHEERS!
Becky cuts the ribbon.
More CHEERS!
MAYOR (cont'd)
Yah-so, while Becky gets on her float,
then, any questions kbout the new
sewer?
Yah, Clem?
JUMP CUT TO:
THE PASSING PARADE:
- THREE FAT VETS, dressed as the Revolutionary War trio,
hold American, Minnesota and POW/MIA flags.
- TWO BATON TWIRLERS stand in front of the Mount Rose
High School Band.
They play - way off key.
- JUDGES wave from a convertible.
Hank, in passenger's
seat, struggles to get out.
His seatbelt prevents it.
- TWO GRUNGY OLD CLOWNS smoke impatiently.
- TWO FAT WHITE MEN, dressed as Indians, sit on scooters.
- FAT MAN drives a riding lawnmower, pulling a flatbed
with A SPEEDBOAT and a FISHING CAMP GROUP.
- FARMER pulls a goat with a sign: "Milk Me for $1.00"
- A BRIGADE of tap dancing BASSOONISTS.
Harold and Hank pull over and park their truck.
Harold
quickly gets out, obviously in a hurry, slamming on a
pouting Hank.
HAROLD
Let's get this straight right now.
We
wouldn't have been late at all if it
wasn't for you.
HANK
I want to have the big bag of little
donuts.
HAROLD
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
HANK
I want to get the big bag of little
donuts.
HAROLD
There's your paint can.
The next time
you drink window cleaner, I'm just
gonna leave it in ya.
Harold rushes off for the parade, joining other folks
carrying baskets, lawn chairs and flags on the sidewalk.
JUMP CUT TO:
PAN OVER to see Gladys helping Becky climb on the swan,
unaware of camera.
In b.g., DOCUMENTARY CREW interviews
Amber and Leslie on their convertible behind the swan
float.
GLADYS
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it.
Now
get up there.
Ride it side-saddle if
you have to - like a horse.
C'mon,
now.
BECKY
It smells funny.
Like gasoline.
GLADYS
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells
like that in Mexico.
BECKY
My dress'll reek.
GLADYS
Listen, little missy, this cost your
dad a pretty penny.
Now get your ass
up there and show me some teeth.
Amber and Leslie, in gowns, look unhappy as they stare
straight ahead, exhaust fumes - that appear to come from
the swan's ass - cover them and their old convertible.
LESLIE
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will
you be sure to cover the hickies on my
neck?
AMBER
Yeah...
LESLIE
And the bite marks on my ears?
AMBER
(slowly turning)
Yes...
LESLIE
I know it doesn't matter, but on my
inner thighs.
AMBER
Yes, Leslie!
Hank rubs his head, then angrily gets out of the truck,
SLAMMING THE DOOR ON ONE OF THE SUSPENDERS ON HIS
OVERALLS.
He starts to walk, but can't, eventually
leaning out from the truck - only moving his arms as if
walking.
Hank, still stuck in the door, is being teased by a GROUP
OF KIDS who poke at him with flags and sticks.
ANOTHER
LITTLE KID taunts him with his cotton candy - keeping it
just out of his reach.
Hank bats at them like
Frankenstein and the torch wielding townsfolk.
Hank, still stuck in the door, holds the little kid by
the back of the shirt in one hand and eats the kid's
cotton candy with the other.
The kid struggles to get
away.
A few BROKEN FLAGS are scattered on the ground.
HANK
Help...Hank!
Help...Hank!
Help...Hank!
Help...Hank!
ON SWAN FLOAT.
Gladys approaches.
GLADYS
Okay, I designed the float, you know.
And, what's gonna happen here is that
this is going to look like a
glistening lake beneath the swan.
IRIS
Uh, Gladys?
GLADYS
What!
IRIS
We need more bars!
GLADYS
This is -- what?
IRIS
Enid ate a whole pan!
GLADYS
I swear to God she can't do anything
by herself.
AMBER
(to camera)
Oh-yah, this is exactly how I pictured
it.
Chokin' on swan gas.
Suddenly, like a gasoline soaked pinata, it EXPLODES!
Gladys is thrown back.
Flames.
Screaming.
PANDEMONIUM!
Becky doesn't have a chance.
She's a pink taffeta BALL
OF FIRE.
The swan's back eventually collapses taking
Becky into it's burning belly.
INTERCUT WITH MR. HOWARD'S VIDEO.
Gladys watches in stunned silence as her daughter and
only chance at State go up in flames.
Suddenly, she
CRACKS!
GLADYS
Oh my God!
My Baby!
The swan ate my
baby!
(grabbing at burning float)
Ow-ow-ow!
Get up, Rebecca!
Get outta
there!
We've gotta go to State!
Oh
hot!
(she scorches her blouse)
Oh, damn.
I like this blouse.
Rebecca!
Get up, angel face.
Time to
go to State!
Ow-ow-ow!
Eventually, Gladys tries to climb up on the float.
Iris
pulls her off.
GLADYS (cont'd)
Get offa me, you cow!
Gladys spins and notices the silent CROWD.
GLADYS (cont'd)
What're you lookin' at?
Huh?
A whole
God Damn town of losers!
That's what
I'm lookin' at!
Crowd reacts.
Gladys notices Amber and runs up to her
car.
GLADYS (cont'd)
You!
You piece-a-shit trailer trash!
This shoulda been you!
Damn, I
shoulda killed you when I had the
The crows reacts again.
Gladys spins, noticing someone.
Lester approaches.
GLADYS (cont'd)
Hey, Ted, sorry.
I didn't know your
family was in the garage when I set it
on fire!
LESTER
Gladys!
Stop it!
GLADYS
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much
as it was a bake sale.
Ah-
hahahahahahahaha!
Lester tries to pull her away from the crowd.
GLADYS (cont'd)
Let go-a-me, you old bastard!
She grabs a BURNING 2X4 off a float and starts swinging
it.
GLADYS (cont'd)
At least you've got another daughter.
CROWD GASPS.
Then stunned SILENCE.
CAMERA CIRCLES
Gladys and Lester getting reaction shots of the crowd.
LESTER
So help me, Gladys.
GLADYS
Becky was my only shot at state!
LESTER
That's enough!
GLADYS
Let go!
Let go of me.
Oh my God,
it's COPS!
TWIN OFFICERS, followed by "COPS" TV CREW, run up and
aggressively tackle Gladys.
As the struggle on the
ground continues, crew guys go over and shake hands with
the "COPS" crew - obviously knowing them.
GLADYS (cont'd)
(pointing to Lester)
He sells reproductions!
His
furniture's as fake as my orgasms!
The COPS crew begins to mingle with the DOCUMENTARY crew.
SCOTT
Hey, man, how're you doin'?
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
Hi!
What's up, Scott?
You remember
Bruce, right?
SCOTT
Long time, no see.
DOCUMENTARIAN (O.S.)
Bruce, that's Roy.
(they shake hands)
Roy, Bruce.
Lovely hillside.
A PASTOR and TOWN FOLK - heads bowed -
stand beside a FRESH GRAVE.
PASTOR
That's why, dear Lord, it's with such
great sorrow that we turn over to you
a young woman whose dream of ridin' on
a giant swan brought about her
untimely death.
Maybe it's your way
of telling us to buy American.
The funeral is over.
Amber, Loretta, Iris and Servettes
awkwardly face each other beside the grave.
Iris takes
the PARTIALLY MELTED TIARA from the headstone.
IRIS
As, uh, actin' President of the Mount
Rose Civil Servettes, it's my duty
since Becky can't fulfill her duties -
kcause she's dead-n-all - to make you
Mount Rose American Teen Princess.
She puts the TIARA on AMBER.
Loretta FLASHES pictures.
MALE REPORTER #1
Turn around and let me see.
Annette, Amber (wearing her tiara) and Loretta are
leaving the crowning ceremony.
All are happy as they
push an extremely drugged Annette out of the cemetery.
LORETTA
What is wrong with you?
AMBER
I don't know.
I just didn't wanna win
like this.
LORETTA
You stop right there.
You are a good
person.
Good things happen to good
people.
AMBER
Really?
LORETTA
No.
It's pure bullshit, sweetie.
You're lucky as hell, so you might as
well enjoy it.
Let's get you a root
beer float.
AMBER
Okay.
LORETTA
Do you guys want some shots?
I'm
buyin'.
Amber sits on the picnic table.
In the b.g., Loretta
exits her trailer with a FED-EX GUY.
She pats his buns
as he exits.
She approaches Amber with a packet.
AMBER (V.O.)
I never liked her, but she didn't
deserve to die in the belly of a swan
like that.
The whole thing's just
kinda sad and lame at the same time.
LORETTA
(handing over packet)
This came for you, sweetie.
AMBER
Ah!
It's from State!
Oh my God!
Amber rips it open and holds up a color brochure with
COLLEEN and TERRY in a glamour shot on the cover.
AMBER (cont'd)
(paging through packet)
It's all the stuff I get to do.
Oh my
God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get
a "personal consultation" with a make-
up artist -- Eeeh!
Okay, um, there'll
be a choreographer to the stars and,
oh no -- No way.
Oh... My... God!
LORETTA
What?
For chrissakes, spit it out.
AMBER
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The
Airport Howard Johnsons!
LORETTA
Right by the airport - Oh, Amber...
AMBER
There's an indoor swimming pool!
Ahhhh!
Loretta joins in the screaming.
AMBER (cont'd)
Oh crap - I only got four days.
I
gotta practice!
MONTAGE BEGINS over MUSIC.
Amber emerges from Loretta's trailer, Pop Tart in mouth,
book bag in hand.
SMILES.
WAVES.
Taps her way down the road, out of the trailer park.
In silhouette, Amber taps on the picnic table by the
light of the FULL HARVEST MOON.
DIP TO BLACK:
WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK: "STATE FINALS"
We look up at the towering Howard Johnsons and see a huge
banner which reads: "WELCOME AMERICAN TEEN PRINCESS,
FRIED CLAM PLATTER $9.99." Suddenly, a 747, not more than
thirty feet above the hotel, flies over - the sound is
deafening.
LORETTA
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
AMBER
Airport Ho-Jo!
LORETTA
I got it!
Yeah, why don't ya take a
Mr. Larson unloads Amber's luggage from the hearse.
Loretta leans against it, arm around Amber, smoking and
occasionally flipping off people who stop to stare at
this unusual sight.
AMBER
Loretta, don't do that.
LORETTA
I'm sorry.
They're just starin'.
AMBER
I gotta work with these women.
LORETTA
Okay, sweetie, that's all right.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Annette (left arm's been amputated and replaced with
metal pincers which she hasn't mastered yet) sits at the
picnic table with Amber and Loretta.
Throughout the
following, Annette struggles to open a beer can which
keeps flying out of her pincers.
(Handmade
"congratulations" posters cover the lawn and trailer.)
AMBER
I just, I just can't believe it.
I'm
Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
LORETTA
Our baby's going to Nationals!
Lincoln, Alabama - look out!
AMBER
I'm gonna be on TV!
Just like Diane
Sawyer.
Annette opens a beer with a new HOOK replacing her hand.
LORETTA
Annette, just use your hand.
ANNETTE
They told me to practice.
AMBER
Okay, ready?
Here's the signal I'm
gonna give Ma when I'm on TV.
Amber MIMES inhaling a cigarette and Annette embraces
her.
ANNETTE
My little Carol Burnett.
In the middle of a corn field.
The "runaway" is a gravel
path cut between rows of corn.
A FOUR-SEATER plane is on
the runway, in front of a group of town folk with hand-
made "good luck" signs.
Amber (in Minnesota sash and
tiara) and the Mayor stand beside the plane.
(NOTE: The
plane never moves.)
MAYOR
