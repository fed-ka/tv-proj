A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck.
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
I will be self-assured and
confident around women.
PIG PEN
I will be self-assured and
confident around women.
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
I will not fear the unexpected.
PIG PEN
I will not fear the unexpected.
The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.
PIG PEN
Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the
bunny.
Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain
control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the
rig together.
The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Charlie, don't surf!
JOSHUA
Quiet, bird.
We're working.
Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen
aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a
specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.
JOSHUA
(dims tank lights)
The sun is going down, my
nocturnal hunters. It's time to
come out and feed.
Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.
MIKE
Yeah. They're definitely getting
bigger.
JOSHUA
I've calculated a growth factor of
twelve percent over the last
forty-eight hours. But that seems
to be accelerating.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
MIKE
All from eating these bugs?
Maybe
I should try some.
Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search
for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged
den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the
cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.
Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
insects.
MIKE
Run, little guys.
JOSHUA
They can't outrun the food chain.
MIKE
I could get away.
JOSHUA
Imagine yourself the size of that
fly. A scytodes spitter would be
as big as a Cadillac. You'd be
spider chow, kid.
Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered
with a towel.
MIKE
Are the new tarantulas in here?
JOSHUA
Took me forever to get a breeding
set of Chilean reds. I must have
bribed every customs agent from
Vegas to Santiago.
Joshua unveils the
tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow
entrances. Joshua
pours in the bugs. A large, male
tarantula comes out
of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,
then wraps its prey
in webbing, turning the insect into a
mummy-like bundle.
MIKE
That is too cool.
JOSHUA
Male tarantulas compete for the
female's attention.

CONTINUED:
JOSHUA (CONT'D)
Each one tries to bring her the
best present. Bugs, rats, even
the occasional parrot.
CHARLIE SQUAWKS.
JOSHUA
The prey is cocooned alive so she
can eat them in her nest. You
know how women love breakfast in
bed.
Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas
scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.
JOSHUA
Take a look, the female of the
species is three times as big as
the male.
Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps
out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red
tarantula.
JOSHUA
Say hello to Consuela.
Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.
JOSHUA
She fills her prey with digestive
acid to liquify the internal
organs. Now watch... She'll drink
her victim from the inside out.
While it's still alive!
MIKE
(looks queasy)
And you wonder why my mom doesn't
like me hanging out with you.
JOSHUA
Arachnids have been roaming the
earth for millions of years. And
they'll be here long after the
human race is dead and buried.
Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.
Mike recoils.
MIKE
Bad!
Bad Consuela!
Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.

TARANTULA POV - MIKE
The multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms
large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.
BACK TO MIKE
Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.
MIKE
Do that again and I feed you to
the parrot.
CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.
The sound of a CAR HORN.
JOSHUA
There's your mom.
MIKE
See you tomorrow, Joshua!
Mike heads for the door.
Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a
string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of
the tunnel.
CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered
clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.
Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes
contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to
scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.
Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.
Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections
of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile
fades...
CHRIS
Damn.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's
sack lunch.
Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The
rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes
rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.
A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
with lunch.
CHRIS
Hope you like bologna!
SAMANTHA "SAM" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity
and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside
her.
MIKE
You
should see them, Mom. Each
one
has a unique feeding behavior.
The
spitters fire poisonous snot.
The
tarantulas mummify their prey.
The
jumpers can...
SAM
Why does he have all those things?
MIKE
He studies them. NASA uses spider
webs in outer space. And for
medicine. They've been here
forever, and they'll be here long
after we're all dead.
SAM
You're givin' me nightmares.
MIKE
Nightmares are cool.

SAM
U.P.S. brought this to the

Sam hands Mike a small package.
MIKE
It's from Dad! He didn't forget
my birthday. I told you he
wouldn't.
SAM
Better late than never.
Mike tears open the box to reveal a Cassiopeia PDA.
MIKE
Rockin'!
SAM
Is that the one you wanted?
MIKE
Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of
ram. Integrated modem. Voice
recording capability. This baby
is tight.
Mike can't turn on the gizmo.
SAM
What's wrong?
MIKE
He forgot to send the batteries.
SAM
(annoyed)
I told him to send batteries.
Sheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past.
SAM
Hang on.
MIKE
Why?
Mike grins from the front seat as Ashley climbs in back.
MIKE
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say can and
will be used...
ASHLEY
Shut up, dork.
Sam climbs behind the wheel.
MIKE
I read her her rights.
SAM
I can always count on you, Mike.
Sam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town.
ASHLEY
Do you get off on humiliating me?
SAM
This bad girl act doesn't suit
you, Ash.
ASHLEY
I'm just trying to have fun.
Don't you remember what it's like
to grow up here?
SAM
That's what scares me.

Sam reaches over and opens the glove box. She pulls out
a stun gun. Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley.
SAM
I told you to keep this with you.
Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack.
ASHLEY
You are so over protective.
Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response.
SAM
A mother's job is to protect her
children.
ASHLEY
You need to start trusting me.
SAM
I'd like to. But you keep
skipping classes to go to the
dunes with Bret.
ASHLEY
Why do you hate him so much?
SAM
I don't hate him. I just want you
to have a future. I thought you
wanted to get out of town. Go to
med school.
ASHLEY
Maybe I want to stay. I could get
pregnant by nineteen. Then
divorce with a couple of kids I
can't handle. Slap on a badge and
be a trailer trash sheriff.
SAM
(deeply hurt)
Thanks for the flashback.
They drive on in painful silence.
Mike turns ON the
RADIO.
HARLAN (V.O.)
... listening to W.F.R.E. Freedom
radio. We've put aside the
U.F.O.'s and conspiracy
theories...
13.
Chris drives into town with the RADIO ON.
HARLAN (V.O.)
... for some down home talk back
with our own mayor: Wade Hale.
CHRIS
Oh, great.
WADE (V.O.)
Thanks, Harlan. As I was saying,
Chemical Technologies has been
looking for viable storage sites.
And Prosperity is lucky enough to
be on that list.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Lucky? I think most of us are
insulted that some outsiders think
our town is a perfect place to
dump toxic waste.
CHRIS
Right on.
Chris smiles as he listens to the RADIO.

WADE (V.O.)
I may have overestimated the need
for 100,000 square feet of outlet
shopping.
Walls decorated with clippings about aliens, monsters,
and conspiracies. Two men sit at a home built
transmitter.
HARLAN GRIFFITH (40s) wears an "Aliens Go Home!" T-
shirt. He eats from a box of Frosted Flakes and drinks
Jolt cola.
WADE HALE (40s) is the mayor of Prosperity. A slick-
haired dandy who looks more like a Vegas lounge singer
than a Mayor.
WADE
With one phone call I could put
together a deal that would make us
all very rich.
HARLAN
They say money doesn't buy
happiness.
WADE
They probably don't have any.
15.
Sam and her kids listen to the radio.
WADE (V.O.)
Money pays for kids to go to
college. It pays the mortgage.
An attractive waitress on roller-skates. A harried CHEF.
Locals chow down. The RADIO BLARES in the b.g.
WADE (V.O.)
It puts food on the table.
Haven't the people of this town
lived hand-to-mouth for long
enough?
FLOYD and LEROY are the Jurassic era barbers. Floyd cuts
Leroy's hair. The two men listen to the RADIO.
WADE (V.O.)
We're all gonna die in this hell
hole.
FLOYD
Yeah, of boredom.
DEPUTY PETE sits with his feet up on the desk reading
Playstation magazine. He listens to the RADIO.
WADE (V.O.)
Wouldn't it be nice not to worry
about surviving retirement? Or
taking a shot at that life-long
dream?
WADE
Think about it, Harlan, you could
buy a commercial transmitter and
start broadcasting to a national
audience.
HARLAN
It would be nice to get the
message out. Let people know the
aliens walk among us.
16.
Chris slows to a stop in front of the McCormick and Son
Mining Company. This stately edifice was once the
driving force behind the local economy.
WADE (V.O.)
If Chris McCormick refuses to sell
his mines. The rest of us are out
of luck.
Chris frowns.
WADE (V.O.)
I don't think it's fair for one
person to wield that much power.
But he's just like his father.
Selfish. Greedy. And more than a
little bit nuts.
SAM
Uh-oh.
Sam flips on the SIREN and accelerates.
The locals stop eating and look toward the radio.
WADE (V.O.)
That family has been digging in
those tunnels since the twenties.
If there was something down there,
don't you think they would have
found it by now?
Floyd and Leroy stare at the radio.
WADE (V.O.)
Common sense does not apply to
crazy people.
WADE (V.O.)
Might as well be chasing a
leprechaun's pot of gold at the
end of the rainbow.

Chris is furious as he PEELS OUT and speeds toward
Harlan's.
The locals watch Chris's pickup speed by.
WADE (V.O.)
... lunatics...
Floyd and Leroy watch Chris speed by.
WADE (V.O.)
... certifiably nuts...
As Sam pulls into town. She sees Chris skid to a stop in
front of Harlan's trailer. He leaps out of his pickup.
WADE (V.O.)
... at the very least...
Chris yanks the door open in time to hear...
WADE
... those McCormicks are just
plain-old dumb.
Wade stands up to protest. But it's too late. Chris
punches him in the nose. The mayor tumbles back.
CHRIS
I've warned you not to talk about
my family!
HARLAN
We have a surprise guest in the
studio.
Chris drags Wade to his feet, shoving him against the
wall.
CHRIS
My family built this town!

WADE
Am I supposed to be grateful?
Chris draws back his fist for another shot.
Sam runs in
and grabs him from behind.
SAM
That's enough!
CHRIS
Stay out of this, Sam!
She manhandles Chris toward the door.
Vintage mining gear. Walls covered with sepia-tone
photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines.
GLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke
from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner.
Ignoring the signs behind her head: "NO SMOKING!",
"DANGER GAS!"
As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a
drawer.
GLADYS
Did you pop him one?
CHRIS
He had it comin'. But Sam
Palmer... That woman abuses her
power.
GLADYS
Why? Because she stopped you from
givin' Wade another pop?
CHRIS
I'm not proud of it.
Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that
honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked
"explored." Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel
off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys.
Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open
and puts out the flame.
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:
CHRIS
I thought you were trying the
patch.
GLADYS
I am.
She raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches.
Chris exits through a door at the back of the museum.
Chris enters the family living quarters. The furniture
was new in 1947. He continues to the adjacent kitchen.
Chris takes a beer out of the fridge. Then he notices an
odd CLICKING. He tracks the sound to a stove burner
permanently on "light."
Chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. He
removes the fuse for the stove. The SPARKING STOPS.
Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer.
Gladys enters with a stack of bills.
CHRIS
That burner's on the fritz again.
GLADYS
Oh something's broken? What else
is new?
(lays bills on table)
You need to pay these by the end
of the month.
CHRIS
(looks at bills)
Today... For a split second... I
actually thought I had it.
GLADYS
Another vein of iron pyrite?
CHRIS
Yeah... Then a rat stole my lunch.
I practically blew myself up
trying to get it back.

GLADYS
I'm glad you like my bologna
sandwiches.

Maybe you should talk to Wade.
CHRIS
What are you saying?
GLADYS
Honey, if he really does have a
buyer...
CHRIS
You of all people know how much my
dad wanted to find that mother
lode.
GLADYS
Your daddy wanted to
get rich. I
don't think he cared
how that
happened. If he was
still alive,
maybe he'd sell those
mines.
Chris takes umbrage...
CHRIS
And maybe you didn't know him so
well after all.
A tense beat.
GLADYS
You're right... I'm just worried
about how we're going to pay these
bills.
CHRIS
Don't give up on me, Gladys. I
promised him I'd find the gold.
And I will.
Gladys steels her fear, patting Chris on the hand.
HARLAN (V.O.)
No charges have been filed in
yesterday's fracas between Chris
McCormick and Wade Hale. And
we've got...
Joshua turns the radio down. He holds a tape measure to
a glass spider tank, recording the size of an unseen
arac.
JOSHUA
An exponential growth rate...
That's impossible.
CHARLIE
Me so horny.
Me love you long
time.
Joshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its
perch.
JOSHUA
Be quiet, bird!
Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching
curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if one
of the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over to
investigate. He lands on the counter and peers around
the back of the tank.
CHARLIE
Charlie's in the wire!
Incoming!
Something yanks the parrot O.S.
JOSHUA
Stop screwing around...!
Joshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices
several feathers floating down to the floor. He heads
over to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear to
reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. No
sign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side of
the tank.
JOSHUA
Where'd you go? Consuela?
She's nowhere to be seen. Joshua spots
something
sticking out from under the table. Two
parrot feet.
Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the
table. It's a
horrible sight. The bird is wrapped in
spider webbing.
His body desiccated.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
JOSHUA
Charlie... Semper fidelis.
Joshua sees Charlie is attached to a web. He tugs on the
webline. Something tugs back. Joshua leans down to look
under the table. His eyes go wide at what he sees. Then
a shadow looms over his head. Joshua looks up and...
Chris drives past.
He catches sight of a figure in a
window.
Sam is brushing her teeth at the window as Chris drives
by. They make eye contact. Chris moves on. Sam looks
at herself in the mirror. Bathrobe. No makeup. Messy
hair. Mouth full of toothpaste.
SAM
Work it, babe.
Sam comes out of the bathroom dressed in her uniform.
SAM
It's all yours.
Ashley and Mike exit their rooms. Mike is dressed for
the day. Ashley in a robe. They race for the bathroom.
Mike is first. Then Ashley hip-checks him out of the
way, slamming the door in his face.
ASHLEY (O.S.)
Ladies first.

MIKE
What's your excuse!?
Sam sticks her head out of a room at the end of the hall.
SAM
You still want a ride, Mike?
MIKE
I'm just going to the mall.
SAM
Have fun.
Mike heads down the hallway and out of the house.
Ashley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs
in.
Ashley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta
rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather
cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is
oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of
her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the
soap.
Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather
builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once
more. The spider returns across its web right in front
of her eyes.
The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead
blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no
water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching
with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has
landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the
spider scurries onto its opposite side.
Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the
washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can
strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.
The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the
beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on
the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it
was there.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks
the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again.
The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders
pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in
horror.
Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower
door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little
spiders.
SAM
Now what?
Ashley just screams.
The SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of
remodeling. Sections of wall are exposed. Sheets cover
furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur.
A cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching
something intently. The cat charges into the wall after
unseen prey.
EMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She
clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop.
He can't hear. She grabs his shoulder and he STOPS
CUTTING.
EMMA
Why do you need to do that as six
in the morning!? Do you hate me
that much!?
HANK
I want to finish before I go to
work.
EMMA
You've been saying that for six
months!
HANK
I can't finish if you keep
interrupting!
Hanks RESTARTS the SAW as Emma staggers into the kitchen.
27.
Emma makes herself a hangover helper. Egg, tabasco,
lemon juice, and a shot of vodka. All of it goes into
the BLENDER. She FIRES it UP. Competing with the noise
of Hank's SAW. Then Emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat
food.
Emma comes back in and UNPLUGS the noisy SAW.
HANK
If you're gonna keep pulling the
plug...
EMMA
Have you seen Zeke this morning?
HANK
He was chasing something earlier.
EMMA
If he got into the wall again,
it's your balls in the blender.
They hear FAINT MEOWING. Hank traces the source.
It's
coming from behind a partially-dismantled wall.
HANK
Hey, Zeke.
Breakfast is ready.
EMMA
I'll get the tuna.
Emma heads back into the kitchen. Hank listens at the
wall. After a beat he hears the CAT RUSTLING around
inside.
HANK
Zeke?
Emma re-enters with a can of tuna.
She hears ZEKE HISS.
EMMA
What's wrong with him?
Hank shakes his head. The CAT noises become more
aggressive. The panicked couple tries to follow the
cat's progress. They tracks the sounds of BATTLE along
the wall. The noises become FRANTIC. SCRABBLING CLAWS.
HOWLS of KITTY pain.
HANK & EMMA
Zeke!?
Zeke!
Zeke!
(CONTINUED)
28.

They follow the cat's frenzied movement up the wall,
across the ceiling, and down the other wall. Hank
hurries over. He can feel his cat thrashing maniacally
on the other side. A FELINE SCREAM. And then deafening
silence.
Hank tears open the drywall, reaching for his cat.
HANK
I've got him by the tail.
He withdraws all that remains of the Zeker... a bloody
tail.
Mike passes NORMAN (18), a janitor polishing the floors.
Norman listens to LOUD DEATH ROCK TUNES on a Sony
WALKMAN.
NORMAN
(conspiratorial)
Hey, dude. Yeah. You.
Mike comes over to this goatee'd rascal.
NORMAN
Wanna buy some smoke?
MIKE
A pack of cigarettes?
NORMAN
Smoke to get high, not to die. My

(considers this)
Does she get high?
Mike walks away, deeper into the mall. A dozen stores
line the hallway: Victoria's Secret, Electronic
Boutique, Sport Chalet. Most of the stores are closed
for good. A large atrium features a fountain and jungle
gym. Skylights cover the ceiling. Mike enters the Home
and Garden store.
Mike goes up to the counter.
The CLERK snaps at him.
CLERK
The bug spray is on aisle five!
MIKE
What?
CLERK
You want mousetraps!?
Is that
it?! Aisle five!
Mike grabs some batteries and lays them on the counter.
CLERK
Oh.
I thought you wanted...
An OLD LADY walks past.
OLD LADY
Excuse me, young man. Where can I

CLERK
Aisle five!
The Clerk grabs the PA's microphone.

He returns his attention to Mike.
CLERK
That'll be three fifty-two.
Mike pays the man.
MIKE
Where's aisle five?
The annoyed Clerk points. Mike heads over. He sees the
aisle is crowded with locals squabbling over the few
remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off.
Mike stops short in the doorway. An off-hook TELEPHONE
BEEPS incessantly. WIND MOANS through shattered windows.
Furniture is tipped over. Mike moves through the chaos.
MIKE
Hello?
Joshua? Charlie?
The spider tanks are shattered. No trace of their
occupants. Mike pulls out his Cassiopeia PDA and starts
recording.
MIKE
(into PDA)
Captain's log. Stardate...
Stops recording, PLAYS it BACK, listens to HIS VOICE.
MIKE
Cool!
(records again)
The house is deserted. No sign of
Joshua Taft or his bird. The
spider tanks are shattered. There
is broken glass everywhere.
Mike moves toward the back door of the cabin.
It swings
open and shut in the WIND.
Chris works with
his pick-axe. He pauses, listening to a
DISTURBING NOISE
somewhere down the tunnel. A growl? A
roar? Chris isn'
t so sure. And then a new sound... a
SCREECHING. The
noise grows LOUDER. Something's coming.
Chris shines his light into the darkness. Trying to see
what's causing the unsettling crescendo...
Suddenly dozens of RATS burst from the darkness.
Sam is behind her desk.
The place is swarming with
locals.
SAM
Quiet!
Quiet please!
The mob is not listening.
BEVERLY
They were clogging up my house!
EMMA
I want to know what killed Zeke!
TRAVIS
He was a good dog! He wouldn't
just get up and go!
Deputy Pete whistles at top volume.
Everybody shuts up.
SAM
I had spiders at my house too.
We

sheriff.
TRAVIS
What about my dog?

SAM
I don't know, Travis. We're gonna

Fish and Game. Okay?
Pete ushers the grumbling mob out of the office.
Mike
avoids the crush and manages to stay inside.
MIKE
Mom! Mom!
All Josh's spiders are
gone!
SAM
I can't do this right now, Mike!
Everyone's having pest problems!
MIKE
But Joshua is gone!
SAM
Maybe he's out looking for his
spiders?
MIKE
Mom, I'm serious! You're not

SAM
Mike... I've got missing pets.
Spiders in the plumbing. Rats and
mice coming out of basements. And
your sister's about to end up on a
milk carton. I can't have you
losing...
The PHONE RINGS.
Sam answers it.
SAM
Hello? Wade... wait a second...
your ostriches?
OFF Mike's look.
Twenty feet down the shaft.
A shape moves.
TRAPDOOR SPIDER POV - MIKE
A MULTI-EYED SPIDER'S VIEW of Mike at the top of the
burrow.
A dark shape inches up the burrow toward Mike.
The kid is FRAMED IN the burrow opening just a few feet
away.
Sam eyes the road ahead.
Mike is lost in thought.
MIKE
We have to go back.
SAM
Mike?
MIKE
That was a trapdoor spider's
burrow.
SAM
What are you talking about?
MIKE
Joshua was feeding his spiders
bugs from the creek. And they
were getting bigger.
Mike glances out the window at the dog running nearby.
MIKE
(agitated)
What if they didn't stop growing?
What if they broke out of their
tanks. Ate Joshua. And went into
the mines?
Sam looks at him like he's out of his mind.
MIKE
That could be why the other
species are coming out into the
open. They're trying to get away
from the giant spiders.

The ecosystem is out of balance.

SAM
Have you been overdosing your
Ritalin?
She checks him for a fever.
Mike turns from his mother and looks out the window.
He
is confused when he doesn't see any sign of the dog.
MIKE
Maybe I am losing it...
He checks himself for a fever.
A dingy collection of buildings surrounded by dunes and
rock. The structures have boarded windows. Graffiti on
the walls. Teenagers hang out. Off-road motorcycles
parked nearby.
Bret Hale's monster truck does donuts in the parking lot.
Ashley hangs out the passenger window shrieking with
glee.
Bret smokes a Phillies Blunt as he donuts his TRUCK.
Ashley laughs hysterically. Bret steers them around to
the back of the truck stop. He SKIDS to a stop.
ASHLEY
Woo-hoo!
Bret offers his stogie.
Ashley refuses.
Bret puffs
away.
ASHLEY
Haven't you had enough of that?
(CONTINUED)

BRET
No such thing.
Norman's bud is
da'kine.
He coughs and they both laugh.
BRET
When I medal at the X-Games, Honda
will give me full sponsorship.
Then I'll take you with me on the
Supercross tour.
Ashley is silent.
BRET
Are you still thinking about going
away?
ASHLEY
I don't know. I want to do
something with my life, Bret.
Help people. Maybe med school is
still an option.
BRET
Not if you keep hanging out with
me.
ASHLEY
Thanks, Mom.
They kiss. Things head toward a serious
level of "get
down." Bret slides his hand up Ashley's
shirt. Ashley
gets into it. But then Bret slides his
hand toward the
buttons of her 501s. Ashley removes his
hand.
ASHLEY
Slow down...
Bret persists.
Ashley climbs off of him.
BRET
I thought you loved me.
ASHLEY
I do!
BRET
Then what's the problem? You want
to leave town. You don't want to
make out.
ASHLEY
I don't feel...
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
BRET
What?
ASHLEY
I don't want to lose my virginity
in the front seat of a monster
truck.
BRET
Why didn't you say so? We can go
outside. I've got a blanket in
the back.
ASHLEY
No... I guess... I'm just not
ready.
BRET
Tammy and Larry do it every night!
ASHLEY
Then call them! Have a menage a
trois!
BRET
Come on,
Ashley. Mommy's not
around.
You don't have to play
the good
girl. Let Daddy give you
what you
really want.
Bret goes after her once more.
Ashley's not into it.
ASHLEY
Please, Bret... Please don't...
But Bret won't listen. Ashley isn't strong enough to
fight him. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her
stun gun. She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the
trigger.
Bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. He
spasmodically jerks off of Ashley and tumbles out the
driver's side door.
Pig Pen stares fixedly at the endless road ahead of him.
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
I will live every moment of my
life as if it were my last.
PIG PEN
I will live every moment of my
life as if it were my last.
Suddenly Bret Hale wheelies across the road. A jumping
spider explodes against the windshield. Spider guts
splatter everywhere. Pig Pen screams as he JAMS on the
BRAKES.
The black and white classic: Tarantula, plays over an
old TV and VCR. Mike is at his computer, downloading a
spider encyclopedia into his PDA. A message flashes
across the screen: CONNECTION LOST. Mike picks up the
telephone.
MIKE
Hello?
Hello?
The line is dead.

Harlan is kibitzing with Travis. Pete and Emma console
each other over dessert. Wade sits alone at a table for
two. The attractive WAITRESS on roller-skates give him a
fresh beer.
WAITRESS
The phones went down for some
reason. Maybe that's why Bret
didn't call. Did you want to go
ahead and order?
WADE
Just give me the usual.
WAITRESS
One ostrich steak, comin' up.
Wade reacts glumly to the word "ostrich."

GLADYS
What are you doing home?
CHRIS
Need some rat traps.
GLADYS
Try the basement.
CHRIS
What is all this?
GLADYS
I wanted to surprise you with a
special dinner. Turkey De La
Gladys.
CHRIS
I'll have mine without Nicotine.
GLADYS
Not as good that way.
Chris goes through a nearby door to the basement.
Chris comes downstairs. He rummages through some junk.
comes up with several rat traps. He turns around to
discover an odd hole in the wall. He ventures over for a
look.
CHRIS
Rats...
Chris leans into the hole, his jacket restricts his
entry.
Chris pulls out of the hole, standing to reveal a large
male tarantula on his back. Chris is oblivious as he
takes off his jacket. The coat lands in a heap atop the
spider.
Chris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in
the hole. He doesn't notice the jacket moving behind
him.
Chris backs out of the hole. He picks up his jacket.
The spider is gone. He grabs his traps and heads
upstairs.
47.
Chris passes through the kitchen.
He eyes Gladys warily.
CHRIS
Have you been smoking?
GLADYS
No.
Smoke pours out of her nostrils.
CHRIS
Gladys...
GLADYS
Get back to work. I'll see you
tonight.
Chris starts out.
GLADYS
Sam called for you.
Chris hesitates.
GLADYS
She wants you to come by the
station.
CHRIS
She really has it in for me.
GLADYS
Oh please.
CHRIS
What?
GLADYS
You two should just sleep together

CHRIS
Me and Sam... Hook up...
GLADYS

GLADYS
I'm not kidding. I got more

So when I tell you Sam thinks your

CHRIS
This is where I throw up.
GLADYS
Don't tell me you don't think
she's a fox.
Chris mulls this over.
Testing his own feelings. He
opens his mouth to ask another question. And then heads
out.
GLADYS
See you for dinner.
Gladys doesn't notice the basement DOOR CREAK open
slightly.
Sam is on the phone at her desk.
SAM
Nothing yet. I'm sorry.
We're
still trying to get...
Chris enters.
SAM
Let me call you back.
(hangs up)
This has been one crazy day.
We've got missing pets, dead
ostriches. God only knows what's
next.
CHRIS
I'm sorry about yesterday. Wade
is... He knows how to push my
buttons.
SAM
I wanted to ask you...
CHRIS
On a date?
Sam freezes for a second.
Chris laughs.
(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:
CHRIS
I'm kidding.
What did you want to
ask?
SAM
Have you noticed anything strange
in the mines?
CHRIS
Define strange.
SAM
I had spiders in my house. Hector
had roaches in his basement. Some
mice...
CHRIS
How about stampeding rats?
SAM
Were they running away from
something?
CHRIS
Could have been. Never saw them
do that before. I guess it
qualifies as strange.
Sam thinks this over.
CHRIS
Sam... Do you want to go out
sometime?
SAM
(taken aback)
Are you asking me out on a date?
CHRIS
Only if you're going to say yes.
Sam smiles slightly.
The basement door is wide open. Gladys mixes food in a
bowl. A cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip.
A male tarantula moves across the ceiling. The creature
is the size of a pit bull. Two quivering palps flank
dart-sized fangs. Multiple eyes the size of quarters.
Hair all over.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
Gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As
she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider
is about to strike, she goes another direction to get
spices, utensils, a pan.
Gladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the
tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her.
Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys
grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she
stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner
knobs, turning on the gas.
Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks
back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she
goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her.
Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the
webline prevents her from slotting it home.
Gladys strains with all
her might, finally slots the
fuse. She turns toward
the kitchen just in time to see
the broken burner spark
to life. The gas ignites. The
tarantula is engulfed in
flame.
Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her
back when a second male tarantula nails her with a
webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the
floor toward the basement door.
The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly.
CHRIS
So that's a 'No.'
SAM
My kids are the world to me,
Chris. When their dad left... it
really took a toll. On all of us.
I can't go through that again. I
won't.
CHRIS
No... I understand... I don't know
what I was thinking...
(laughs)
Gladys has some crazy ideas. I'm
gonna kill her.
Deputy Pete throws open the door.

OFF Chris's look.
Ashley watches TV. A doctor resuscitates a dying patient
with CPR. The doctor counts as he pumps the man's chest.
TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
One... two... three...
Ashley watches intently.
The patient is revived.
TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
Helping people never gets old.
Ashley hears KEYS in the front DOOR. She quickly
switches channels to MTV. Sam enters with Chris.
SAM
Is Bret here?
ASHLEY
No.
SAM
Then why is his truck out front?
(CONTINUED)

ASHLEY
Don't worry about it.
SAM
What do you mean?
What happened?
ASHLEY
Nothing.
Ashley starts crying. Sam goes to comfort her daughter.
Chris stands by in shock. Watching, Upset.
ASHLEY
Nothing happened, alright!
Ashley runs off to her room.
Sam follows.
Chris stands alone for a beat. He walks to the kitchen
and pulls a bottle of Vodka from the freezer. He puts
the cold bottle against his head and neck. Trying to
cool off.
Mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of
exoskeleton. He sees Chris opening the bottle of vodka.
MIKE
Spiders shed their skins when they
grow.
Chris looks at Mike for a moment.
MIKE
Like snakes.
CHRIS
Gladys is dead.
Chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle.
MIKE
Maybe not.
That got Chris's attention.
MIKE
This is a tarantula's leg. Or it
was. It's an exoskeleton, to be
scientific.
CHRIS
It's a little large.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
Chris has another gulp of vodka as Mike holds up his
Cassiopeia full of spider data. He shows Chris a video
of a male tarantula mummifying its food. Chris watches
in amazement.
MIKE
See! Male tarantulas wrap their
prey in webbing. Tight like a
mummy. The food stays alive so
they can eat it later.
Sam enters the room in time to overhear this.
SAM
Mike, please.
Now isn't the time.
Chris looks up at Sam.
CHRIS
They keep their food alive.
Mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton.
SAM
What is this?
MIKE
A spider's leg!
Sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor.
MIKE
Careful!
SAM
No. That's a piece of cactus.
Look... It's covered with spines.
MIKE
Those are quills! Tarantulas can
flick them at you like darts!
Mike does an odd flicking motion.
Kind of like a dog
scratching a flea.
SAM
Giant tarantulas?
MIKE
Tarantulas! Wolfs! Trapdoors!
Joshua had a ton of exotics!
(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:
CHRIS
If there were giant spiders
roaming the desert, don't you
think somebody would've seen them
by now?
MIKE
The jumpers hunt in daylight. But
not the others. They only come
out when the sun goes down!
The group looks to the window, the sun hangs low in the
sky.
The garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes.
Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband's
clothes.
SAM
I guess I should watch more
'Oprah.' It must be a textbook
'no-dad' kind of thing.
Chris shifts awkwardly.
In shock.
Sad.
Sam holds up a
flannel shirt.
CHRIS
That one looks kind of scratchy.
Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it
and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt.
SAM
All Jason cared about was getting
out and starting over. I guess
that included buying a new
wardrobe.
Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning
up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't
register Sam ogling his exposed chest.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
CHRIS
Gladys thought I should sell...
but you know... I never wanted to
get rich. If it was about the
money, I would have sold out to
Wade a long time ago.
Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants.
CHRIS
I think I just wanted to prove the
gold was down there. That my
family wasn't crazy to keep
looking. Even after we'd lost so
much. And now... she's gone, too.
SAM
I'm sorry, Chris.
CHRIS
Do you know what I'm trying to
say?
SAM
It wasn't about spending the gold,
it was about finding it.
CHRIS
That's right.
That's exactly
right.
Sam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy's
struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, but
catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door.
CHRIS
Remind me never to let you do my
laundry.
She turns, only to see him in a mirror. He steps out
from behind the car. Sam stares at him.
SAM
They look great.
A melancholy N'SYNC ballad plays over a BOOM BOX. Ashley
sits on her bed with her back to the open window. The
sun setting in the distance. She rips up the photographs
of Bret.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
Ashley doesn't notice the Great Dane-sized spitting
spider crawling in through her window. It is striped
like a jungle predator.
It comes all the way into the room and then lingers among
Ashley's stuffed animal collection.
Mike checks the phone. Still dead. He types at his
computer, entering the specification of the piece of
exoskeleton. A digital representation of a spider grows
on his monitor screen. Showing Mike exactly how big the
spider would be after shedding this skin. Mike is
distracted by the LOUD MUSIC coming from Ashley's room.
MIKE
Can't you turn that down?!
MIKE (O.S.)
I'm doing spider research!
Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals,
oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn't move. Ashley
grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. She
returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with
scissors.
The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it
moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos and
mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turns
around to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezes
momentarily.
ASHLEY
(sotto)
Spider... Mike... Spider...
Ashley sees her stun gun is on
the dresser. She lunges
for it. She's almost got it.
The spider squirts two
lines of gummy web at Ashley.
The glop hits her int he
chest, carries her backward.
Glues her to the wall.
Chris finishes
dressing. He faces Sam. There is an odd
moment as they
find themselves standing close. If the
circumstances
were different they'd probably end up
kissing. And
then they hear ASHLEY'S bloodcurdling
SCREAM.
58.
Mike pops out of his door. Sam and Chris run down the
hallway. Sam yanks open the door to Ashley's room.
Sam, Chris and Mike stand in the doorway staring at a
giant spider menacing Ashley. The spitter fires another
webby blast, sticking the girl's legs to the wall.
MIKE
Wow!
A scytodes spitter!
Chris pushes past Sam and Mike. He grabs a chair and
shoves it at the spitter like a lion tamer. The spider
backs off. Sam takes off running down the hallway.
ASHLEY
Where are you going?
Sam runs up to find a gun case. She tries to get a
shotgun, but finds it locked. She doesn't have the key.
Sam grabs objects in the room and smashes the gun rack to
pieces.
Chris has the chair in one hand to fend off the spider.
With the other hand he tries to get Ashley out of the
webbing. Mike stands nearby reading from his Cassiopeia.
MIKE
The scytodes spits a gooey
discharge to immobilize their
prey.
ASHLEY
No shit!
The spider hits Chris's chair with a blast of webbing.
The chair is blown from his hand, and stuck to the wall.
Chris stands weaponless before the spider.
ASHLEY
Use my stun g...
Ashley is nailed in the face with another blast of goo.
Mouth sealed shut. Chris reaches under the bed and
pushes it over on to the spitter. The spider leaps clear
onto the wall.
(CONTINUED)
59.

MIKE
(reads)
Watch its fangs! The spitter's
fangs move from side to side as it
fires!
CHRIS
I'll keep that in mind.
Chris grabs the spitter from behind and drags it off the
wall. The spider turns to fight. Chris wrestles it to
the ground. He sees the fangs begin to move from side to
side and rolls clear of a point-blank web shot.
Sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning
roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of its
binding. She grabs the bang stick and runs from the
room.
Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He
looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the
spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung
across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of
his shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grab
for his scissors. He gets them.
MIKE
Get under it! Stab it in the
abdomen! They don't have any
armor down there!
CHRIS
How am I supposed to do that!?
The spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair.
Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in the
door with her shotgun. Chris is covered in spider guts.
CHRIS
I'm gonna need some new pants.
Sam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then
pops a fresh clip into her 9mm. Chris comes out of the
garage wearing clean clothes. Sam chucks him the pistol.

SAM
Ever used one of these?
CHRIS
I'm a fast learner.
Chris tries to put the gun in his pocket. And then his
waistband. But these damn pants are too tight.
Ashley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair.
MIKE
I told you! I told you all!
But
nobody ever listens to Mike!
Still think I'm crazy, Mom?
SAM
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Ashley is about to hyperventilate.
SAM
Calm down, baby.
ASHLEY
There aren't enough wine coolers
in the world to calm me down!
SAM
I won't let anything happen to
you.
Sam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun.
CHRIS
What other spiders did Joshua
have?
MIKE
Spitters, jumpers, orb weavers,
tarantulas...
CHRIS
Why couldn't he keep goldfish like
a normal person?
Sam checks the phone.
It's dead.

Good one.
We'll go to Harlan's.

You want to go outside?
Harlan is broadcasting.
HARLAN

common forms. They hide in plain
sight.
Harlan is startled as Sam and the others enter with guns.
SAM
We need to make an emergency
broadcast.

MIKE
Giant spider invasion.
Harlan's jaw drops.
Sam takes the microphone.

You

SAM

Is this thing on? Hello? This is
Sam Palmer. We have an emergency
situation.
This funky old couple relaxes in their LaZee-Boys.
SAM (V.O.)
They are extremely dangerous.
The forelegs of a tarantula reach over the top of the
man's recliner, yanking him clean out. The woman is
oblivious as her husband is dragged away across the
floor.
Floyd and Leroy use brooms to fend off several wolf
spiders.
SAM (V.O.)
Stay together and head for the
mall.
A spider eats the chef. The waitress roller-skates away
from an arachnid. She jumps through the window into the
street.
Harlan has donned a vintage football helmet and pads.
CHRIS
The mall?
SAM
The walls are concrete and the
exits have steel gates. We could
hold an entire army of giant
spiders from inside.
ASHLEY
You just said giant spider on the
air.
Sam sees the microphone is keyed.
HARLAN
Now that's great radio!
SAM
Not giant spiders!
I meant to
say...
Harlan notices long spider legs passing the window.
HARLAN
The aliens!
64.
The survivors hustle inside. They lock the glass doors
behind them. The spiders are still coming.
MIKE
Get away from the doors!
NORMAN
Be cool, little dude.
They're
locked.
MIKE
Glass won't stop them!
The spiders begin smashing through the glass doors.
Chris and Sam SHOOT to keep them back. People flee into
the mall.
SAM
The gates!
Close the gates!

Wade and Norman proceed to lower the slotted steel
security gates. Only problem is: Sam and Chris are on
the other side.
ASHLEY
Mom!
MIKE
Hurry up!
Sam and Chris see the gate coming down. They run for it
and slide underneath just as the gate comes down. A
massive trapdoor slams up against the metal. But the
metal holds.
SAM
Shut the other entrances!
Norman and Chris run toward the opposite end of the mall.
Chris and Norman arrive. Spiders are SMASHING through
the GLASS. Chris and Norman bring the gate down. They
back away as more spiders slam against the steel.
NORMAN
Trick or treat.
Chris and Norman head back to join the others.
They
find...
The survivors gather makeshift weapons. Floyd take a
chainsaw off the wall. Norman practices swinging a heavy
sledgehammer, accidentally toppling a stack of paint
cans. Hank stands before a display of circular buzz
saws.
Chris goes to where Sam doles out the few firearms.
CHRIS
We're sealed up at both ends.
Sam hands Chris a shotgun.
He tries to get the feel of
it.
SAM
You pump the slide to jack in a
fresh round. Point at your target
and squeeze.

Chris tries it out, pumping the slide. A shell flies out
the slide of the weapon and hits Wade in the head.
WADE
Watch it!
CHRIS
Like that?
Sam shakes her head and takes the gun back.
She pulls a
machete off the wall and hands it to Chris.
SAM
Try not to cut yourself.
The place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege.
Separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the
entrances to watch the spiders' every move.
WADE
Why didn't we see them earlier?
MIKE
For the last time! They can't
handle the sunlight. They were
waiting in the mines for the sun
to go down!
CHRIS
Then at daybreak they'll go back
inside. We can walk out the front
door.
MIKE
We won't make it that long.
ASHLEY
They're gonna come in after us?
MIKE
They're growing very fast. They
need food to sustain that kind of
development.
HANK
Someone should go out and get
help.

SAM
You're not goin' back out there,
Pete. None of us are.
CHRIS
Radio Shack is full of cell
phones.
WADE
But the signal won't get out of
the valley. That's why we
couldn't sell any of the damn
things.
HARLAN
My antenna...
The group looks up. The moon-cast shadow of the antenna
is visible on the skylights that run the length of the
mall.
HARLAN
I could climb up to the top. I
bet I could get a signal out.
WADE
Great idea.
You should do that.
CHRIS
I'll cover you, Harlan.
Wade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door. Sam
stands with her kids. Watching. Chris looks over his
shoulder for one last look. Sam runs up to him, gives
him the shotgun.

While I'm gone, do you think you

Uhh... Do you want to go out
sometime?
Dinner? Maybe a movie?
Chris takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her
lips.
Wade holds open the nearby access door.
WADE
Hey, loverboy... you've got a town
to save.
Chris and Harlan head out. Sam watches them disappear
through the door and then returns to the survivors.
ASHLEY
You're not really going to get him
bigger pants are you?
SAM
No way.
Wade leads Chris and Harlan up a tight staircase. The
door at the top is identified as "Roof Access." Wade
reaches the door. The others bunch up behind him.
CHRIS
Don't even think about locking
this door.
WADE
I'll be right here waiting.
Wade slowly opens the roof door.
Mike collects perfume. Packing it into his pockets like
grenades. Ashley is nearby, checking out the lingerie.
ASHLEY
I didn't know you wore cologne.
MIKE
I don't.
It's spider repellent.
Sam steps in through the door.
SAM
Let's stay together, guys.
ASHLEY
(holds up a teddy)
Can I get this?
SAM
Move it!
The kids run out to join their mom.
After they go...
The grill of an air vent is pushed open. A huge spitting
spider pushes its way through. Dropping to the floor.
Another spider follows.
Sam gazes up at the skylight. She can see the silhouette
of Chris and Harlan climbing the antenna. Pursued by
spiders.
SAM

Oh my God...
Ashley screams in horror nearby.
ASHLEY
They're inside!

The spider charges.
Floyd slices its legs off.
FLOYD
How about a little off the top!
He slices another arac.
Sam looks up to
see Chris come crashing down through the
skylight on the
antenna. The antenna tilts in at a sixty
degree angle.
Chris hangs off the end. Orb weavers ride
their weblines
down to the floor of the mall.
Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. He sees a
hundred spiders coming in on webs. Flooding out of the
stores. The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere!
MIKE
Arac attack!
Chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. He slides
down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the
bottom. Sam runs to his side.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
SAM
Did you get help?!
Is anybody
coming!?
CHRIS
We're on our own!
Sam tosses him a gun and they head toward the jungle gym.
The waitress roller-skates away from the spiders. She
slaloms clear of several spitters. But gets tackled by a
jumper.
Ashley and Mike are hiding.
ASHLEY
I can't stay in here!
Ashley starts to move out
of the tube. She discovers the
end has been covered with
web. She pushes it. Something
on the other side pushes
back. Ashley scrambles back.
Mike is already moving.
The kids flee through the tubes
to get away.
ASHLEY
What are they doing?
MIKE
(checks Cassiopeia)
They're trapping us like ants in a
log! Once they have all the exits
blocked, they'll come in through
the last one!
They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a
spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume
grenades at the spider, covering their retreat.
Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes.
Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers.
MIKE
We've gotta go!
Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide.
ASHLEY
Here!
She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider
looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But
it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the
arachnid clear.
78.
Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam
finish off the spider and then run with the kids.
Emma runs parallel to them across the playground's
sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider.
Hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his
tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand.
HANK
It's tool time!
Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his
chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry
spider descends on him from above and knocks him to the
floor.
Chris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s.
He
stops for a moment to look at the jeans.
SAM (O.S.)
Chris!
Chris continues on.
All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and
prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all
directions.
Mike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT.
Others use their make-shift weapons.
Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it.
Mike sees this
and gets an idea.
MIKE
Where do you grow your weed?!
NORMAN
Dude, if I tell you, I have to
kill you.
Norman takes a hit on his reefer.
MIKE
They're going to kill us, you
stoner!
Norman sees the army of spiders closing in.
NORMAN
Over here!
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
Norman opens
an access door. Sam and the other survivors
run over and
crowd through it. Norman shuts the door
behind them.
The groups of pursuing spiders collide and
begin ripping
each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy.
Norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway.
WADE
Where are you taking us?
NORMAN
To Shangri-la.
Norman leads the survivors into a basement room full of
pot paraphernalia. Hookahs. Weed growing in hydroponic
units under battery powered lights. Psychedelic posters.
NORMAN
You aren't going to arrest me for
this are you?
SAM
Not today.
The group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door.
WADE
(to Norman)
Oh great! Now you've trapped us!
Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs.
CHRIS
We should be able to hold them off
for a little while.
Suddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them.
ASHLEY
They're coming through the wall!
The group tightens up. Back to back. Ready for the end.
Suddenly a human hand punches through the wall.
CHRIS
What the hell?
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:
Bret Hale rips through the drywall. Filthy but alive.
Standing in a horizontal mine shaft. He sees Sam's gun
pointed right at him.
BRET
I didn't touch her!
I swear!
Sam looks at Ashley.
ASHLEY
Don't waste your bullets.
Wade embraces his son.
WADE
I thought you were a goner, boy!
Chris steps to the opening for a closer look at the mine.
CHRIS
We can get out this way!
ASHLEY
Aren't the spiders in there?
MIKE
Not until daylight.
The BANGING on the upper door gets more INTENSE.
Norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered
grow lights from his weed farm. He passes them out to
the group.
Chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the
mine shaft. Bret is shocked as the others follow him.
The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.
BRET
You're going back in there?!
Are
you all crazy!?
WADE
Come on, Bret!
BRET
No way!
I'm not going!
Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and
spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through the
opening.
81.
Bret runs past Sam and Chris. Sam FIRES her SHOTGUN at
the first spider that enters the tunnel. Her GUN CLICKS
DRY. She un-holsters her PISTOLS and FIRES.
CHRIS
Cover me!
SAM
What are you going to do?!
Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper
support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. Sam
FIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.
SAM
Hurry!
Sam's GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the
machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attacking
spiders.
Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of
dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for an
awkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...
SAM
Hold that thought.
They manage to disengage and move on.
Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
remaining survivors.
WADE
We're trapped again!
CHRIS
At least they can't follow us.
SAM
Which way do we go?
CHRIS
I think we're in one of the old
tunnels.
SAM
Can you get us out of here?
CHRIS
Don't worry, Sam.
Chris takes point with the others following nervously.
82.
A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD
SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file
into a slightly more open area with two branching
tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with
barrels of toxic waste.
CHRIS
I don't believe it...
Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the
barrel in the drainage ditch.
MIKE
I've seen one of these before!
ASHLEY
What are they?
CHRIS
Toxic waste.
SAM
Where did you see it, Mike?
MIKE
The creek where Joshua gets his
spider food. There was one in the
water.
Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.
CHRIS
We can get out this way!
BRET
No, we can't.
(turns to Wade)
Isn't that tunnel blocked off,
Dad?
Chris and the others look at Wade.
WADE
Uh... yeah... he's right.
We
can't get out that way.
CHRIS
You did this?
WADE
I knew you'd never sell... We're
under my property so...
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
SAM
You put all of us at risk.
WADE
I didn't have a choice! I was
broke! They gave me a hundred
grand!
Sam punches him.
Knocking Wade to the ground.
SAM
I think our lives are worth a
little more than that.
CHRIS
We're wasting time.
Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others
follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after
them.
Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across
bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs
runs along the roof into both tunnels.
CHRIS
One end of these lights should be
connected to a generator. That'll
be near the entrance.
They continue down the tunnel.
Entering...
A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.
Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.
WADE
My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't
lying! That's what I can put on
the insurance form... giant
spiders!
ASHLEY
Ewww... what's that smell?
The others are reacting strongly.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
CHRIS
Methane.
This cavern is full of
gas.
ASHLEY
What does that mean?
CHRIS
One spark and we're all dead.
Norman swallows his glowing joint.
Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.
MIKE
That's what I was talking about,
Chris. Presents from the male
tarantula to the female.
BRET
So the female's around here?
Bret looks around nervously.
The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a
horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh
balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.
He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid
drained away.
Mike hides his eyes.
Ashley comforts him.
SAM
That one just moved!
Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete.
The
web comes away to reveal a human hand.
CHRIS
There's somebody in here!
Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.
They finally reveal Gladys.
CHRIS
Gladys!
The woman's body begins to spasm.
CHRIS
Gladys, please...
(to the others)
Can anybody help her?!
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward.
ASHLEY
Her breathing is shallow.
She's
going into arrest.
Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.
Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.
CHRIS
It's okay.
It's okay.
Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.
From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.
GLADYS
Am I... dead?
CHRIS
You're okay.
GLADYS
I'm not in heaven?
CHRIS
No...
GLADYS
Then what's with all the gold?
Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the
cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The
reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the
cavern walls.
WADE
Gold! Gold!
Look!
It's
everywhere!
SAM
Is it real?
Chris checks it out.
CHRIS
Jesus... it's the mother lode...
He was right. My dad was right...
Chris helps Gladys to her feet.
They share an emotional
look of recognition.
GLADYS
So were you.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
Wade chips away at the gold.
WADE
Get as much as you can!
Bret looks at Ashley.
BRET
Nice work, Doc.
Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade.
Sam
puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder.
SAM
You saved my life.
Ashley smiles.
Gladys leans over to Norman.
GLADYS
Have you got a smoke, kid?
NORMAN
The man says this cavern is full
of highly flammable methane gas.
I smoke to get high, not to die.
SAM
Spiders!
The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows.
NORMAN
What's the big deal?
Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his
boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.
Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the
squashed bodies.
MIKE
I think you should stop.
NORMAN
Why?
MIKE
They don't have hair. They aren't
fully grown tarantulas.
Chris and Sam look over.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
MIKE
They're giant babies!
Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.
Chris reacts to the noise.
He can guess what's coming...
The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela
has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far
the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair.
Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.
Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.
MIKE
Consuela.
CHRIS
Consuela?
The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is
something weird there. A lot of weird things. In
fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
tarantulas.
As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized
quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain
spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.
NORMAN
Bummer...
Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him
tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,
chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.
CHRIS
Go!
The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.
A
male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam
BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away
bits of gold.
CHRIS
Leave it!
WADE
So you can keep it all!?
Hell no!
Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a
nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms
behind him.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
BRET
Dad!
Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for
him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's
chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings
Wade into the cave.
CHRIS
Bret, come on!
Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing
more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret
leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.
ASHLEY
Bret!
Ashley goes to his side.
BRET
I'm sorry I...
Bret dies.
Sam drags Ashley away from him.
The survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to
rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling.
SAM
We have to get out!
CHRIS
This is our chance to kill them
all.
Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand.
CHRIS
When the power comes on, the bulb
will ignite the methane and torch
them!
SAM
Where did you get an idea like
that!?
Chris looks at Gladys.
GLADYS
I blew up the kitchen.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
CHRIS
Keep going up the tunnel. There
should be a generator at the exit.
Start it up and await for my
signal to throw the switch.
SAM
And the toxic waste...
CHRIS
Will be buried under tons of rock!
Go!
SAM
What about you?
CHRIS
I need to set the fuse as close to
the spiders as I can. That should
give us time to get clear.
Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls
down the lights, dragging them back toward the
tarantula's den.
SAM
He has a cute butt.
Don't you
think?
GLADYS
U.S.D.A. choice.
Chris comes through with his light bulb fuse. Consuela
and her babies are feasting on the bodies of Bret and
Wade Hale.
Chris finds a vent in the ground.
He sprinkles dust over
it to identify a faint draft.
CHRIS
Bingo.
He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas
jet.
Mike helps Gladys up the tunnel. Sam and Ashley are
behind. Suddenly a male tarantula steps out of the
shadows, separating the groups.
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
MIKE
Mom!
SAM
Keep going!
Sam and Ashley flee down another tunnel.
Chris finishes preparing the booby trap. He gets up to
leave. Only to find Consuela coming toward him.
CHRIS
I hate spiders.
Chris runs out of the cavern.
Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running.
Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula. Sam stumbles
over something on the ground. It's Bret Hale's lost
motorcycle. Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula
coming after them.
ASHLEY
Hurry!
Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She
STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam
accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The
bike's headlight illuminates their path.
The male tarantula scurries after the bike.
Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs
on tight. They've put some distance between themselves
and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.
Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.
Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward
the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's
shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite
direction.
ASHLEY
Oh shit.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears.
SAM
Banzai!
With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard
onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is
roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel.
Chris runs along the tunnel. Consuela charges after him,
Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs.
Chris runs.
Smashing light bulbs.
Consuela close
behind.
CHRIS
Start the generator!
92.
Chris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him.
He keeps
going.
Sam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel. She tries to
start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate.
CHRIS
Throw the switch!
SAM
I don't have any power!
ASHLEY
Yo, Mom!
Sam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN. Sam catches
it and brings it down to the light bulb cable... ZAPPING
it.
As Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially,
traveling past him into the cavern.
A broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the
gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout
the mines.
A huge column of flame blasts into the chamber. All the
gold is illuminated. Consuela's babies are burned like
popcorn.
93.
The chain reaction spreads through the mines.
Jets of
flame blast up tunnels.
Torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home.
Rupturing the very earth around them.
Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance.
BUILDINGS EXPLODE. Jets of flame burst upward. The mall
is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth. The
humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling
desert.
The group sits in a long beat of abject shock. And then
Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally
ripped.
CHRIS
I really need some pants that fit.
The group smiles.
Happy to be alive.
MIKE
Look out!
Everyone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny
rabbit hops across the highway. Gladys HONKS and swerves
to avoid it.
