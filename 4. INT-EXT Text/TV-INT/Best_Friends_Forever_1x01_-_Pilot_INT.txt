                                  LENNON
                    Okay, there s no way you coulda 
                    seen this coming.

                                    JESSICA
                    I m an idiot. Here I was running 
                    around waxing things and talking to 
                    stupid Dr. Gail and he d already 
                    given up. I bet it s Short Bangs, 
                    that girl from the Lisbon office...

                                  LENNON
                    Let s not jump to any conclusions.

                                    JESSICA
                    I didn t trust her the moment I 
                    laid eyes on those knee-high socks 
                    and those mary-janes...

                                  LENNON
                    That is not a professional look.

      Joe enters and sits down in his inflatable Jets chair.

                    But I bet she s a lot less work 
                    than I am. She s who I was when 
                    Peter and I first fell in love.

                    We rode tandem bikes. Now, no one 
                    wants to ride tandem bikes with me.

                    Hey babe, do you mind...?

                                  JOE
                    Oh! Sure. Girl talk. I get it.

                    Can we watch Steel Magnolias?

                                  JOE
                    That sounds like fun, but we re

                                  JOE
                    Yeah, we keep it real lazy: best

                    Fine. But only cause it s for Len.

                    Look, Len, it s like Fallout 3: New

                    Right? I mean, I prefer yours. But 
                    you need them to balance your 
                    crossbow, cause even though you 
                    have all this weaponry available, 
                    you insist on using a crossbow. How 
                    bad-ass is that?

                                  LENNON

                      I wouldn t have a choice. 

                                  LENNON
                    Yeah, cause she d knock you out

                    No, it ll be good for me to have 
                    something to focus on other than 
                    the shattered pieces of my life.

                                  JOE
                    What s the big deal? So, you had 
                    feelings for her and you punched 
                    her husband in the face at their 
                      wedding...

                                  RAV
                    I didn t have feelings for her. Who 
                    said that?

                                  JOE
                    Jess s Cousin Dana. She said it 
                    first, but we were all thinking it. 

                                  RAV
                    Cousin Dana needs to shut her pie 
                    hole. You know she s a man, right?   UNTITLED PARHAM/ ST. CLAIR  "Pilot"11.


                                  JOE
                    What?! But in the wedding pictures, 
                    she has those big boobs and she s 
                    wearing that giant purple blazer!

                                  RAV
                    Yeah, that s a man.

                                  JOE
                    Oh my god. 

                                  RAV
                    And what happened was, I told Jess 
                    not to marry Peter, he found out 
                    and told me never to talk to her 
                    again. So I punched him in the 
                    face. 

                                  JOE
                    Because you had feelings for her.

                                  RAV
                    No, Joe. Because Peter is a douche 
                    and he was never good enough for 
                    her, okay? Drop it. I m not coming.

                                  JOE
                    Alright, I get it. You can t do 
                    this for Len, even though the night 
                    your bar opened she saved your ass 
                    by convincing the kitchen staff not 
                    to walk out...

                                  RAV
                    Don t do this, Joe.

                                  JOE
                    ...using only her broken, high 
                    school Spanish. They still call her 
                     El Jefe. 

                                  RAV
                    Fine. If Jess comes to my bar, I 
                    will think about talking to her. 

                                  JOE
                    Awesome. (a beat) I shoulda known 
                    about Cousin Dana. She was wearing 
                    a bolo tie.

                    Hey, Angelo.

                                  ANGELO
                    When are you two ladies gonna marry 
                    me?

                                  LENNON
                    She s getting a divorce.

                                  ANGELO
                    Don t you worry about it. You get 
                    back to your fighting weight, get 
                    out of those khakis... You ll be

                    which of my premium meats can I 
                    interest you in today?

                    We just need seven pounds of ground 
                    chuck. We re making chili.

                                  ANGELO
                    Alright, lemme find the grinder.

                    Do I really look that bad in these

                    my fighting weight?

                                  LENNON
                    No, it s just those front pleats 
                    give the illusion of extra weight.

                    about this shit again. I don t even 
                    have any good underwear.

                    No, Len. I can t start all over 
                    again. Where am I gonna live? Some 
                    sad studio with a hot plate and a

                    supposed to do? Kick my best friend

                    just get a cabin in the Berkshires

                    Great! I LOVE scented candles!

      Jess comes in the kitchen to find Len amidst the chaos of 
      pots and pans, rubbing a lamb shank against a cheese grater.

                    Lennon, stop. What are you doing?

                    I m sorry, too, but we don t have 
                    time for that! We have to make 
                    Joe s chili, cause it wasn t fair 
                    and we had a plan and I deflated

                    Monster chili. We can do this!


      Len is crafting homemade Scoops out of a batter, Jess is 
      blowing up the Jets chair and Queenetta is boiling wieners.

                                  LENNON
                    Q, pick up the pace on the wieners. 
                    Jess, ETA on the Jets chair?

      Jess can t answer, she s out of breath. Joe walks in.

                    Are you guys making my Monster

                    away with taking care of Jess and I 
                    forgot all about our stuff.

                                  JOE
