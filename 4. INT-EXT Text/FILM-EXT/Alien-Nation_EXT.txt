MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE)
A LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering
just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away.
The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert-
scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its
true shape and appearance indistinct.
The VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then
pans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles
and personnel.
Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted
scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the
armed infantry.
Everyone stares off at the same point on
the horizon.
Waiting.
The VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it
moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a
second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards
behind the Army.
LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck
beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes
glued to the distant object.
The VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked
local TV van, finds the object again in the distance,
zooms in, and waits, like everyone else.
Abruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box
CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.
CRAIS
That was the scene in California's
Mojave Desert three years ago today
-- the historic first view of the
Newcomer ship upon its dramatic
arrival.
As with the assassination
of John Kennedy, who among us does
not remember exactly where he was
that October nineteenth morning,
when news first broke: that people
have landed... from another star.
We PULL BACK from a large television set to reveal...
SLUG-MOBILE - STREET - NIGHT
An explosion of color and movement as OPENING TITLES PLAY
very quickly.
We're TRAVELING the streets in a n.d.
sedan, getting MOVING GLIMPSES of the aliens living among
us now:
-- A coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables.
-- A Newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of
books.
-- A city park where a number of alien families have
gathered to play some arcane alien game.
SYKES
Jeez... they call that gang-bang a
game...?
-- A billboard for Pepsi featuring an alien.
-- The sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light.
Suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to Sykes'
head... and alien hand.
Sykes jumps.
It's a NEWCOMER
DERELICT standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own
language.
In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of
milk.
We know immediately what he wants.
Sykes rolls
down the window.
SYKES
Take a hike.
Sykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light
changes and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the
street.
Sykes grimaces at the smell.
SYKES
Why's it have to be sour milk that
these guys get wasted on?
What the
hell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or
Thunderbird for chrissakes?
(beat; disgusted)
Slagtown.
Shit...
-- Aliens hanging around outside their homes.
-- Alien hookers plying their trade.
SYKES
Hope their plumbing's the same.
TUGGLE
It is.
(and Sykes gives him
a look)
-- A Newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug-mobile.
-- An alien couple exit a theater playing "Terminator
III".
-- An alien wig shop.
ANGLE
TITLES END, and we start to PULL BACK into the slug-mobile
and HEAR:
TUGGLE (O.S.)
So you gonna go, or you not gonna
go?
STREET - NIGHT
Sykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb
among other parked cars.
STREET - NIGHT
The two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked
cars across the street from the mini-mart.
Through the
store window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the
counter.
His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat
and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it
right at him.
The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun
and covers the door.
Sykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.
SYKES
You got your vest?
TUGGLE
Of course.
Right in the trunk of
the car.
SYKES
Yeah, that's comforting.
Mine, too.
Through the store window the robbery continues in
pantomime.
Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun,
yelling orders in the alien language.
The Proprietor is
quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register.
The PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands
in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.
The
Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired.
Sykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the
street from the store entrance.
TUGGLE
Watch the driver.
I'm going for a
better angle on the door.
SYKES
I got him.
Don't get pinned.
Tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater-
corner across the intersection.
Through the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag
of cash, shove it in his coat pocket.
Bills fall out, but
he doesn't care.
Then, without warning, Kipling whips up
the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's
chest!
The Proprietor slams back against the shelves,
slides to the floor.
Kipling leans over the counter and
FIRES another round into the Proprietor.
SYKES
(under his breath)
Aw, shit.
Tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the
shots.
The human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a
few doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots
Tuggle.
He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine
pistol on the seat next to him.
STREET - NIGHT
Tuggle dives behind a lamp post.
The Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine
pistol to fire at Tuggle.
Sykes sees this and opens fire
at the Driver.
The Driver turns and fires at Sykes.
Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is
sprayed with bullets.
A forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between
Sykes and the Driver.
Once the truck is past, Sykes is
standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.
He
rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver.
Tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the
shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.
SYKES
Get outta there!
TUGGLE
I can't!
Do you mind!
SYKES
I'll cover you!
Get outta there!!
Sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway
car, firing toward the store as he goes.
Kipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover.
Tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp
post and runs to the stalled civilian car.
He slides
across the hood and drops behind the car for cover.
Tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car
window.
His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver
who is still inside the car.
OLD MAN
Can I get out now?
TUGGLE
Move it!
Sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in
the store.
As he considers his next move--
Tuggle fires at the two aliens.
They return fire and he
slides down to safety behind the car.
Or so he thinks.
Glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by
the shotgun blasts.
He flinches as another blast hits the
car.
He looks over.
There's a big exit hole in the
fender beside him.
THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR.
Another exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder.
Panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS
and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of
the car.
He has nowhere left to go and--
-- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely
in the chest throwing him back onto the street.
Sykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of
nine years blown away.
Kipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his
shotgun CLICKS empty.
STREET - NIGHT
Sykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body.
One glance is
enough.
Nobody ever looked deader.
SYKES
Aw shit, Tug, Jesus!
Goddamn it!
He stares, shocked and incredulous.
He can't find a way
to think or feel about this.
Then we see him going crazy
right before our eyes, the rage revving.
He takes off
toward the store as SIRENS are HEARD rapidly approaching
in background.
ALLEY - NIGHT
Sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round
the corner at the far end of the alley.
He takes off,
quickly cranking up to full speed.
BACK STREET - NIGHT
Sykes rounds the corner.
Doesn't see them anymore.
He
slows... moves along this street with some caution.
Lots
of shadows, lots of hiding places.
Sykes HEARS a NOISE,
looks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge
billboard.
He cuts loose with the shotgun.
Sykes dives.
Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the
night.
Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the
crates.
Raincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.
He drops it, swings
down off the fire escape, runs off.
Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.
TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT
Sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street.
The only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up
ahead.
Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.
MINI-MART - NIGHT
OPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over
his face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the
Coroner's wagon.
WIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching.
The
Wagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD
black-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of
them aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some
alien).
He moves into:
SYKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
The slug-mobile pulls up.
A drained Sykes moves up the
walk to his front door.
POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY
They approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile.
SYKES
Anyway, what's it matter to you if
we think it's funny, right?
Whatta
you care?
JETSON
That is exactly so.
(completely deadpan)
It is like your name... Sykes.
I'm
sure it doesn't bother you at all
that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss",
two words in my language which mean
"excrement" and "cranium".
Sykes looks at him, perplexed.
JETSON
"Shit... head".
Jetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing
there, the smirk dropping from his face.
CUT TO:
MINI-MART - LATE AFTERNOON
The shattered windows have been covered with plywood.
Through the open doorway we see Jetson talking to the
Proprietor's Wife.
She studies a photo Jetson shows her,
nods her head, speaking rapidly in the alien language.
CUT TO:
REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON
Sykes drives along beside the mammoth, steaming network of
buildings and pipes that make up the refinery.
CUT TO:
SLUG-MOBILE - JETSON'S STREET - DUSK
We're SHOOTING THROUGH the slug-mobile window as Sykes
pulls up in front of Jetson's modest but immaculately
maintained home on the outskirts of Slagtown.
Jetson's
WIFE, an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn
with a garden hose.
Jetson's son, age six, rides his
bicycle along the walkway.
Jetson, dressed in his suit
for work, crouches near the walkway, playing with his son.
Sykes pulls the car toward the curb, rolls his eyes.
SYKES
Jesus.
Welcome back Ozzie and
Harriet...
He HONKS the horn.
Jetson looks up, then moves to his
wife and kisses her goodbye.
Moves to his son, kisses him
on the top of his head.
Sykes watches all this... and as he does, slowly his
derisive expression softens.
As corny as this tableau may
be, there's something very appealing about the innocence
of it... even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes.
Jetson starts to climb into the car, and we--
CUT TO:
BILTMORE HOTEL - HARCOURT AND KIPLING - NIGHT
Walking behind the others.
They speak in very low voices;
Harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing VIPs
during:
KIPLING
That cop, the human, he was the one
who killed Anderson and the driver.
HARCOURT
This is becoming a serious breach of
security.
KIPLING
He didn't recognize me.
HARCOURT
It is his new partner that I'm
worried about.
CUT TO:
SHOOTING RANGE - FIRING LINE - NIGHT
Jetson, looking bizarre in his ear-protectors, is taking
careful aim with his .38 as Sykes walks up.
Jetson slips
the protectors down.
SYKES
Well, let's see what you got,
Cochise.
Gimme six, rapid fire.
Jetson, a little nervous at this command performance,
turns, sets, and FIRES at the silhouette target.
It's a
large, sloppy grouping.
SYKES
(continuing)
How long you been shooting?
That's
pitiful.
Whattya gonna do if
somebody draws down on you, wave
your scores on the written exam at
'em?
Sykes starts loading the thumb-sized bullets into the
Casull.
JETSON
Why did you do it?
SYKES
Why'd I do what?
JETSON
Agree to work with me?
You don't
like me... you don't like any of us.
You have nothing but contempt for
us.
And yet you become an outcast
from your club of detectives by
making me your partner...
SYKES
My partner is dead!
Because one of
you bastards killed him -- then
disappeared into a rathole down in
Slagtown, where he's home and dry,
'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody
says nothing...
Sykes grabs a bullet-proof vest from nearby, slaps it onto
the hanging target form.
He hits the switch, running the
target down to the end of the lane.
SYKES
(continuing)
But he didn't figure on you, George.
You're going to get me through that
wall of silence.
You're going to
make them talk to me.
You're going
to help me find that Slag son-of-a-
bitch.
Comprendo?
And if Fedorchuk
and the boys in the bullpen don't
like it, screw them... and if the
Captain doesn't like it, screw
him... and if all the Slags down in
Slagtown don't like it... well screw
them too!
Sykes raises the Casull, fires.
KA-BOOM!!!
The shell
rockets clean through the bullet-proof vest on the target
form.
The recoil slams Sykes back, jerks his arm up.
KA-
BOOM!!!
again, and another hole is drilled through the
vest.
Other shooters look over.
Sykes sets the gun
down... sees his hand is bleeding.
Jetson absorbs all
this, as we--
CUT TO:
"X" BAR - NIGHT
A violet neon "X" FILLS FRAME, flashing hypnotically.
It's a bar catering to rough-trade Newcomer clientele.
Several ALIEN MEN, brute laborer-types, lounge around out
front.
They glare with antagonism as Sykes and Jetson
climb out of their car.
SYKES
(to Jetson)
Okay, just stay back and do what I
do.
Watch and learn, watch and
learn...
"X" BAR - NIGHT
Porter leans against an alley wall.
He speaks English
learned on the streets.
JETSON
You don't know what your father and
these two men were arguing about?
PORTER
I told you -- I was in the back of
the store.
I just heard voices,
muffled like.
SYKES
One of the two men was Hubley,
right?
What about the other one?
Did you know him?
PORTER
Yeah... I seen him around.
High-
roller dude named Strader.
Joshua
Strader.
Runs a club on the west
side.
Encounters.
SYKES
Yeah, I heard of it.
PORTER
That's all I know.
You want
anything more, you ask somebody
else.
He pushes away from the wall, heads for the door to the
bar.
JETSON
I am sorry about your father.
Porter throws him a look over his shoulder, then
disappears through the door.
Sykes and Jetson start down
the alley.
JETSON
If I may make a suggestion... We
have different weak spots than you
do.
Next time, a blow to the nerve
plexus under the arm, here, will
produce the effect I think you were
looking for.
SYKES
Yeah, sure.
I knew that...
CUT TO:
BURGER STAND - NIGHT
The wall-mounted menu is in English and the Alien
Language.
The SERVERS are teen aged humans and aliens.
Sykes and Jetson stand at the counter awaiting their
order.
KID
(serving them)
Six forty-two.
They both put money on the counter.
The kid goes to put
the order together.
Sykes looks at the alien characters
on the menu.
SYKES
I don't think I could ever learn to
read that shit.
(beat)
How long did it take you to learn
English?
JETSON
Three months.
(off Sykes' look)
We learn quickly.
We adapt.
It is
our strength... what we were bred
for, to adapt to hostile
environments.
The Serving Kid puts their bags on the counter.
JETSON
(continuing)
Thank you.
They take the bags and walk off, digging the food out of
the bags as they talk:
SYKES
My neighbor's kid has a Newcomer
girl in his class.
She's six years
old and in seventh grade already...
They climb into the car.
SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
As Sykes pulls onto the street.
SYKES
So what was that other word for
Human... Slow ka?
JETSON
Ss'loka'.
It means literally "small
but intelligent creature".
(Sykes looks over,
doesn't know if he
likes this)
It loses much in the translation.
SYKES
And what was that one about my
mother?
That was a good one.
JETSON
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
SYKES
Yeah, that's it.
Say it slow.
Jetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along
haltingly.
After several tries, he can say it passably
well.
FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
Jetson pounds down the fire escape.
Below him, he sees
Watson reach the ground and take off running for the
parking area.
Jetson reaches the ground and gives chase.
ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Watson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting
down other rows trying to make up the distance between
them.
FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
Sykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen
feet to the ground.
ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Watson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires
it up.
Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls
his gun, aims.
The white reverse-lights flash on.
Jetson stands there,
gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot.
In that split
second hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to
avoid being hit.
ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars.
Sykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car.
Watson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his
arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct
hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms.
Watson
folds over with a "ooowwph" sound and drops to his knees.
SYKES
(breathing hard)
I'll be damned.
It worked.
(sees Jetson run up)
How'd you like that, huh?
Whammo!
Both barrels.
Dropped him like a
bag of cement.
Jetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet.
He looks at the
I.D.
SYKES
Who is he?
JETSON
Todd Watson.
The assistant manager.
Watson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one
agonized breath.
WATSON
I don't believe this.
Look at my
suit.
Look at what you made me do
to my car.
SYKES
(laughing)
Your girlfriend put up a better
fight than you did, pal.
JETSON
We are looking for your employer,
Joshua Strader.
WATSON
He's out of town.
JETSON
Why did you run?
WATSON
Because you two were chasing me.
SYKES
We were chasing you because you ran,
you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
JETSON
When will Strader return?
WATSON
Who knows.
He's the boss -- he
doesn't have to check in with me.
SYKES
(wearily)
Watson... this is my partner here's
first coupla days, and he wants to
make a good impression.
Me, though,
the way I feel -- this could be my
last day, know what I mean?
And I'm
ready to rain on you like a cow
pissin' on a flat rock.
WATSON
Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been
around for a coupla days.
He didn't
tell me where he was going or when
he'd be back.
I swear it.
SYKES
(to Jetson)
What do you think?
JETSON
I believe he is probably lying.
SYKES
Through his ass.
(to Watson)
Next time you see him, tell him to
call me... unless you want us to
keep coming back on you like a bad
case of herpes.
Sykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket.
They walk away and Watson slumps against his car.
ANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON
as they walk wearily to the slug-mobile.
SYKES
George, you can handle the women
from now on, you mind?
CUT TO:
ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Watson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he
hears footsteps.
He turns with a "What now?" expression
and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead.
He
goes down.
Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN
THUGS.
One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's
employ.
QUINT
(to other Thugs)
Okay, scrape him up.
CUT TO:
ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT
Harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access
road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs.
The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d.
van.
Harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back
of the van.
Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three
human Thugs.
They have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing
the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron.
He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious.
HARCOURT
Any progress?
QUINT
My arm's gettin' tired and so far,
zip.
KIPLING
He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to
Strader.
QUINT
What's that mean?
KIPLING
Duty-bonded.
His allegiance to
Strader is above pain or life.
QUINT
You tellin' me this guy would die
before he'd screw his boss and work
for us?
Nobody's that dumb.
KIPLING
It is something you couldn't
comprehend, Quint.
Harcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to
keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand.
HARCOURT
I understand you have been resisting
my offer Mr. Watson.
Your sense of
duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but --
no longer an issue, I'm afraid...
Harcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from
the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot
twice through the front of his silk suit.
Watson's eyes
widen in fear.
HARCOURT
(continuing)
I will not make this offer again.
I
want you to work for me, to manage
the nightclub as Strader's successor.
If you do, you will know a wealth
and comfort our people never dared
imagine...
Watson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant.
WATSON
Sss'k'a ta'!
Harcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring
his resolve.
Then--
HARCOURT
It is such a pity to die for an
outmoded value.
(rising)
Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for
our friend's swimming lesson.
Watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains.
HARCOURT
(to Watson)
It's important to learn new skills.
Essential to your growth as a
person.
Quint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper.
He bucks
and lunges as they drag him toward the surf.
Quint
addresses one of the Thugs, a new guy.
QUINT
You never seen this before, have
you, Billy?
oh, man, you ain't
gonna believe it... seawater is like
battery acid to these guys... I
don't know what it is, some kinds
chemical reaction.
Whatta you think
it is, Watson?
Whoa, hold him.
(a wave breaks
outside, the foam
rolls in)
What I love about the surf is you
can never tell how far up it's going
to come until it... whoops, got a
little wet there.
The wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs.
He
screams.
Flailing, one of his hands dips below the
surface of the water.
He howls and yanks out his hand.
We see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand
droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the
hand.
The Thugs get Watson swinging.
QUINT
Last call, sucker.
One... two...
THREE!
Watson is flung into the surf.
ANGLE
Harcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the
waterline.
We HEAR Watson's GURGLES and SCREAMS... then
nothing.
Kipling is very nervous this close to the water.
Harcourt seems unperturbed.
KIPLING
When we picked him up, he was
talking to those two cops -- the two
who came to question you about
Hubley.
HARCOURT
This is getting out of hand.
I want
you to deal with it.
Immediately.
A wave rushes up the sand.
Kipling quickly steps back.
Harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops
six inches from his dress shoes.
HARCOURT
(continuing)
We must learn to embrace the things
we fear... and from that grow
strong.
A moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo.
He motions to Strader's body and the surf.
The Thugs grab
the body and heave it into the waves.
CUT TO:
STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN
The slug-mobile parked at the curb.
Silence, then the
RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this
street at the corner.
The tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug-
mobile.
The driver stays inside as his passenger alights
carrying a tool kit and a paper bag.
The human is Quint.
Quint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then
slides behind the wheel.
STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN
Meanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car.
He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck.
It is sliding around the corner out of sight just as
Jetson stumbles out of the car.
He whips out his gun from
the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand.
Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien
phrase, clearly the equivalent of "Fuck it...".
CUT TO:
PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - ZUMA BEACH - DUSK
CRANE SHOT, nice and WIDE, showing the slug-mobile turning
off P.C.H. onto a gravel road which curves down the the
beach.
The following is V.O. as the car approaches the
water.
JETSON (V.O.)
Stop the car.
SYKES (V.O.)
Why?
JETSON (V.O.)
Please, I must get out here.
SYKES (V.O.)
Come on, you won't have to get near
the water.
JETSON (V.O.)
Stop the car!
We see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust.
BEACH - DUSK
A quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a
person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk
suit.
Wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and
other high tide detritus.
ANGLE ON SYKES, FEDORCHUK, AND ALTEREZ
looking down at the body.
A CORONER'S TECHNICIAN is doing
a closer inspection.
FEDORCHUK
Found his wallet in his jacket
pocket.
Joshua Strader, big as
life.
CORONER'S TECH
Jesus, what a mess.
It's gonna be a
bear to make a positive
determination, but it looks to me
like he was shot before being tossed
in the drink.
At least twice--
(indicates where
hearts
would've
been on the body)
-- here, and here.
Sykes absorbs this.
He rises along with Fedorchuk and
Alterez.
SYKES
How're you two doing on Tuggle's
killer?
ALTEREZ
The store owner's son is in a street
gang, so now we're thinking maybe
it's gang related.
SYKES
Yeah, that's real good.
You guys
follow up on that for a coupla
months.
Fedorchuk looks up at Jetson standing on the bluff above.
FEDORCHUK
Look at your dildo partner.
He's
too scared to even come down to the
sand.
(calls up to Jetson,
even though he's too
far away to hear)
You're not gonna get wet standing
here, moron!
SYKES
I'd like to see you next to a sea of
hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see
how much surfin' you'd do.
Alterez shoots a polaroid of the body.
Sykes grabs it as
it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car.
Fedorchuk flips him the bird.
As Sykes rounds the car, he
sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid
chalk marker a big star with "E.T. P.D." printed inside
it.
Sykes looks around.
Fedorchuk and the others stand
together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his
direction.
SYKES
Cute.
BEACH ROAD - DUSK
Sykes has stopped to pick Jetson up.
He's wiping the "E.T. P.D."
from the door as Jetson
approaches from the edge of the bluff.
Fedorchuk pulls up
alongside in his n.d. sedan.
He calls off to Jetson, who
is still twenty yards away.
FEDORCHUK
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson.
Forget you hip waders, big guy?
SYKES
Lay off, asshole.
FEDORCHUK
I may be an asshole, but at least
I'm a real detective, not some outer
shit space thing.
Sykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be
highly dangerous, saunters to Fedorchuk's car and leans
against it.
SYKES
Yeah?
you're a real honest-to-god
detective...?
Sykes grabs the back of Fedorchuk's head and slams it into
the steering wheel, BAM-HONK!, and in doing so, has hurt
his hand again (the hand he hit Jetson with).
He shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing
Fedorchuk's car keys with the other.
SYKES
(continuing)
Then detect these!
Fedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car
keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff.
Jetson, just
climbing into the slug-mobile, witnesses the last of this
scene without knowing how it began.
BURGER STAND - NIGHT
A different burger stand.
Sykes and Jetson sit across
from each other at one of the outdoor tables... Sykes with
his greasy burger, Jetson with his mole strips.
This time
they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they
talk.
SYKES
... So we've got three guys dead.
All Newcomers, all killed the same
way -- execution style.
JETSON
Warren Hubley was in middle
management at a refinery... Joshua
Strader operated a successful bar
and nightclub...
SYKES
... and Porter ran a piece of shit
mom-and-pop mini-mart.
(beat)
So what the hell's the connection?
CUT TO:
COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT
Sykes and Jetson move quickly to the slug-mobile.
Sykes
reaches for the driver's door handle with his punching
hand.
He winces in pain... the son-of-a-bitch still
hurts.
He looks across at Jetson opening the passenger
door.
SYKES
George?
How about you drive...
Jetson looks over at him... gently reacting to this vote
of confidence.
They walk quickly around to the opposite
doors, climb in.
ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
CLOSE on a limousine door as it opens and a tall figure
rises from the back seat.
We TILT UP to reveal William
Harcourt.
We MOVE with him as he walks to the n.d. van (from the
beach scene) parked in front of the limousine.
Kipling is
just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab.
Quint
exits the driver door.
Kipling slides open the van's side
panel, reaches in for--
-- a large black suitcase.
He slides it out.
Harcourt
nods.
He and Kipling start into the club, followed by
Quint.
SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second
floor.
Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top
of the stairs waiting for them.
She's very uncomfortable
dealing with Harcourt.
Kipling and Quint continue on
toward the office door.
Harcourt pauses with Cassandra.
He touches her neckline of her dress, letting his fingers
linger against her flesh.
HARCOURT
Quite lovely...
(best)
What is your name again?
CASSANDRA
(flinching
involuntarily at
his touch)
Cassandra.
HARCOURT
(a chilling smile)
I will have to remember that...
He continues down toward the office door.
Cassandra
watches him go.
CUT TO:
REFINERY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT
REFINERY - NIGHT
The slug-mobile skids to a stop at the loading dock
entrance.
Sykes and Jetson climb out.
They hop up onto
the loading platform and move purposefully into the well-
lit interior through the open door.
REFINERY - NIGHT
This time Jetson is the Juggernaut... his expression set
and hard... as he strides to the car.
Sykes practically
has to run to keep up.
SYKES
George, c'mon -- lighten up.
It's
a beauty of a case.
Don't sweat it
-- we got him by the short hairs.
He ain't gonna make any more of the
shit.
JETSON
The fifty kilos, Matthew.
I have to
find it.
I can't let it get out on
the street.
SYKES
Why?
What's the big goddamn deal?
Jetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile,
yanks it open.
SYKES
(continuing; as
Jetson starts the
car
You destroy that drug, you destroy
the case.
Don't blow the whole
thing now by not following
procedure.
JETSON
(through the open
driver's window)
Fuck procedure.
And to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels
out.
SYKES
Hey!!
Jetson accelerates toward the security gate.
The guard in
the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile
bashes through the barricade bar.
SYKES
GEORGE!
GODDAMMIT!!
Sykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no
car.
A pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off
his shift starts ambling past.
Sykes runs in front of it,
waving his badge.
The pickup skids to a stop.
SYKES
Police.
Get out.
I need this
thing.
Out, now!
The poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into
gear.
The truck has seen better days... it doesn't have
much power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit.
CUT TO:
FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
Harcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs.
Jetson
is ten feet above them.
Sykes flies out onto the fire
escape, a few steps behind Jetson.
A POLICE CAR SIREN is
HEARD arriving O.S.
ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT
Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into
the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running.
Two seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the
fire escape, find themselves near the unit.
HARCOURT
Here!
He throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps
in.
Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear
and floors it.
Jetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels
out.
Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing
car.
One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the
rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going.
JETSON
This way!
He indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.
They race to
it, jump in... Sykes driving.
He burns rubber as he pulls
out.
A second arriving police unit pulls into the alley,
heading straight for the slug-mobile.
Sykes has to grate
between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get
past.
WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
Harcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come
thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic.
The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them.
INSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE
Harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches...
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and
SIREN blast on.
WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
It looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing
the howling police car through traffic.
Jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it
out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy.
JETSON
Slow traffic on your right... you're
clear at the left rear...
(Sykes changes lanes)
Careful, red light ahead...
With Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the
cross-traffic without incident.
WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
The traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response
to the approaching lights and SIREN.
Kipling dodges
around the stopped traffic easily.
The same traffic that has pulled over for the police car
now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the
slug-mobile.
WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
Sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the
intersection, and continues the chase.
On the wrong side
of the road, head-on into traffic.
Headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along
the wrong side.
They eventually catch up to the police
unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between
them.
Sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull
with the other.
He brings it up and around right in front
of Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window
at Kipling.
At that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the
bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser.
Jetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to
something else he sees beyond it.
JETSON
Green light, Matthew.
(Sykes doesn't
respond)
Green light!
Now Sykes looks.
The light at the intersection has just
turned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting
start coming.
It's a wall of headlights coming right for
the slug-mobile.
SYKES
Shit!
JETSON
Ss-ai!
WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
Sykes locks up the brakes.
Kipling veers around a couple
of cars and speeds away.
Because of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of
action.
He skids a left onto a side street.
SIDE STREET - NIGHT
Sykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a
right onto another street that parallels the street the
police unit is on.
At the first street available, he cuts
back in behind the police unit.
FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT
Sykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the
police unit directly above them!
An on-ramp approaches
for the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it.
FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT
With the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right,
cuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto--
SECOND STREET AND TUNNEL - NIGHT
The police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street
tunnel.
It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a
pile-up of traffic behind the police unit.
The slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of
traffic in the tunnel.
Sykes is out of the drivers door
in a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells--
SYKES
Move your goddamned cars!
People climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered --
ignoring Sykes.
Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his
bumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car
far enough forward to get around.
He speeds off.
BLACK-AND-WHITE - FREEWAY - NIGHT
Kipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp.
Harcourt smiles
with satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile
behind them.
Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of
traffic.
FREEWAY - NIGHT
Sykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian
traffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at
Indianapolis.
INTERSECTION - NIGHT
Door handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the
right.
The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes
stays right on its ass.
They charge up onto--
VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT
The police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80
MPH.
VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT
They reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto--
HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
A clear two lane straightaway near the ocean.
Sykes
pushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the
police unit.
The two cars trade blows at 90+ MPH.
Kipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder,
slowing him down.
END OF BOULEVARD - NIGHT
The police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain
link fence where the road ends.
An abandoned drawbridge
and the ocean are on the other side of the fence.
With nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at
Kipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came.
HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
The two cars are racing for a full head-on.
At the last
instant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile
sideways, passenger side first.
The police unit smashes
into the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both
cars skidding madly to a stop.
A fire ignites under the
hood of the police unit.
HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
Sykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to
Jetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge
unconscious alien away from the cars.
He's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt
pulling himself through the smashed police unit window.
Bruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the
suitcase, then starts to run with it.
With Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes
clambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off
after Harcourt.
Harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the
closed drawbridge.
He heaves the suitcase over, then
starts to climb.
Sykes lumbers past the burning police unit.
Kipling is
still behind the wheel, his head slumped forward.
Sykes
is just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods
and door panels and glass flying in all directions.
Harcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the
suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the
abandoned drawbridge.
Sykes reaches the fence.
Instead of climbing, he simply
blows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the
gate.
ABANDONED DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT
The end of the bridge is in the "up" position... a huge
asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky.
Harcourt
runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the
bridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him.
His
foot slips once and he almost goes over the side.
Sykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a
prominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming.
Harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge --
and has nowhere to go.
He is backed into a corner, with
seawater on two side of him.
Harcourt pivots frantically,
sees Sykes coming this way.
Harcourt is a trapped animal.
His chest heaves in panic.
Then his gaze falls on the
suitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of
resolve comes into his eye.
ON SYKES
He eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows
Harcourt is.
There's some movement among the shadows, and
Sykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against
the trigger.
Perspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink.
A long moment then--
ANGLE - THE SHADOWS
Harcourt emerges from the darkness.
His face is composed,
the superior glint is back in his eye.
His arms are held
away from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in
surrender.
Sykes cat-steps forward slowly.
Harcourt stares at Sykes'
eyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an
excuse.
Harcourt simply... smiles.
SYKES
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're
history...
HARCOURT
No, Sergeant -- not history...
(beat)
Eternity...
And now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of
the one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind
his arm.
He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes,
then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open.
The blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin.
His
mouth fills.
He looks back at Sykes, making eye contact... his eyes
mad, defiant.
And -- he swallows.
Long hold -- then the
wallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in
agony as he begins to convulse.
Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers
the Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and
goes into a massive violent seizure.
His limbs hammer
against the deck... his back arches fiercely.
It is a
brutal, agonizing ten seconds.
Then, finally, his body
becomes still.
Sykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to
him and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it.
HIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA
Sykes stands.
He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it,
and hefts it.
He carries it with him back toward the
inferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and
cold in his hand.
ANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES
He approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson.
As he
passes the burning cars, we have a half-second to register
that the driver's door of the police unit is now open
before--
-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.!
Sykes
is thrown forward.
The suitcase crashes to the ground,
and the Casull goes skittering off.
Sykes looks up -- to
be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of
Kipling!
Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes
hears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND.
He looks -- and
sees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist.
It
connects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who
killed Bill Tuggle!
Kipling brings the suitcase above his head.
He is a half-
second from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN
ROARS.
Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound.
Sykes
looks.
ANGLE
Jetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull.
Kipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the
suitcase again.
Jetson, shaking but determined, fires
again, and again, and again.
Kipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase
still over his head... until he is blasted at last and
forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the
inferno.
Sykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side.
Jetson has
let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground.
Sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the
alien's hand.
The two partners remain like this, bathed
in the orange flickering glow of the fire.
HIGH WIDE SHOT
of the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two
cops...
DISSOLVE TO:
HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
The police mop-up is winding down.
Cop cars, coroner's
wagons, fire trucks.
We MOVE through it all to find Sykes
and Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing.
JETSON
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I
assume you will be requesting
reassignment now.
SYKES
(cool)
It'd be for your own good.
I think
you'd be better off with a partner
who's a little more... by the book.
(smiles)
... Still, I gotta tell you, George,
for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on
wheels once you get going.
I'd
kinda hate to miss your next two
days as a detective.
Jetson smiles.
He glances up as they are bathed in red
and blue light.
A patrol car has pulled up next to them.
Inside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop.
WILTEY
I'll give you guys a lift to the
station.
They're waiting to take
your statements on the shootings.
SYKES
(to Jetson)
Let's go, partner.
(then casually
correcting Wiltey
as he rises)
And it's shooting.
Singular.
WILTEY
They said two.
SYKES
Nope.
I didn't shoot Harcourt... he
o.d.'d.
SHOCK CUT - JETSON
We rapidly PUSH IN ON HIM as his head snaps around toward
Sykes.
His expression tells us his blood has just turned
to ice.
CUT TO:
STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT
Jetson, Sykes, and Wiltey move warily forward, their guns
drawn.
They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's
flashlight, shines it through the open back doors.
The
doors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges.
One of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from
end to end.
The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol
car can be seen through the wagon's front windshield.
Jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car,
Sykes and Wiltey follow.
Lights all ablaze, it too is
abandoned.
One door has been wrenched off its hinges and
lays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed.
Our three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots
something beyond the unit.
WILTEY
Oh, God...
Sykes and Jetson look.
The bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as
well as the two OFFICERS from the patrol car, are crushed
and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt.
Their arms
are twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down
the street toward the dock warehouses ahead.
Wiltey
stumbles away, backward.
WILTEY
I'm calling for back up, now.
JETSON
Wiltey, no.
But Wiltey is going.
Jetson starts after him... but Sykes
grabs his arm, hard, and spins him.
SYKES
What is this?!
JETSON
(low)
... It's Harcourt.
SYKES
Harcourt is dead.
JETSON
No he's not.
Not if he overdosed on
the drug.
(searches for the
words)
Massive amounts trigger a... a
change.
Your body functions seize
up, you appear to be dead, but it's
really a state of incubation.
When
you emerge you're...
SYKES
(looks at the four
bodies sprawled
before him)
Tell me about it...
CUT TO:
STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT
One minute later.
OPEN CLOSE on a light shining into
CAMERA, then WIDEN to reveal it is one of the door-mounted
spotlights on Wiltey's patrol car.
Wiltey eases the car
down the center of the street.
Sykes and Jetson, guns
ready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes
everywhere.
MOVING POV
as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching
for any signs of movement.
BACK TO SCENE
Sykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as
they walk.
Their eyes everywhere.
SYKES
I never thought I'd say this, but --
for once in my life I think I'm
willing to wait for back-up.
JETSON
We can't let him get away.
SYKES
Why the hell are you so dead set
against back-up?
JETSON
(a difficult
admission)
Because... because of what will
happen if humans see what we are
capable of becoming.
SYKES
But there's no more drug.
JETSON
You understand that.
But how many
others will?
Sykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression.
Just then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across
his headlight beams fifty yards ahead.
Whatever it was,
was large and fast.
It darted into an open warehouse
door.
WILTEY
There he is!
And Wiltey floors it.
Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to
stop him.
JETSON
Wiltey!
He and Sykes take off running.
Wiltey skids to the left,
rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight.
Sykes and Jetson pour it on.
They hear a SCREECH OF
BRAKES.
They reach the warehouse door and race through.
WORK SHED AREA - NIGHT
Jetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing
blast of the Casull.
He gauges as best he can the
direction it came from and takes off running.
DOCK - AT STAIRS - NIGHT
On the CUT, Sykes' body is already tumbling down these
rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse,
having been thrown ruthlessly from above.
As Sykes' body
sprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt
appears at the top of the stairs.
Sykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet.
Harcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the
railing the last fifteen feet.
Harcourt lurches forward
and, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him
down the docks.
STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT
The first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at
the coroner's wagon.
The Officers leap out, flagging
other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses.
DOCKS - NIGHT
Sykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost
collapses again.
Harcourt comes at him.
Then Sykes sees
it--
-- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of
the jetties.
Sykes makes a break for it.
WAREHOUSE - AT STAIRS - NIGHT
Jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs,
frantically scanning for any sign of Sykes.
Then, in the
distance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty
-- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt.
Jetson
gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive
look, then gathers up his courage, and races down the
stairs to help Sykes.
JETTY - NIGHT
Sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty.
The fishing boat is
already passing the end of the jetty.
Harcourt is fast
behind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults
off toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing
net piled on the rear deck.
He yells in pain as his ankle
twists under his weight.
FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Sykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard,
relieved that he has escaped.
JETTY - NIGHT
Harcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes
did, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then
onto a second jetty.
And from here, he vaults across the
seawater onto the boat.
FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the
cabin.
The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the
open sea.
DOCKS - NIGHT
Jetson sees this and is shitting bricks.
Suddenly the
stark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from
above.
Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low,
the sun-gun washing over the docks.
FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Sykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net
toward the back of the boat.
Harcourt gets one hand on
his leg.
Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws
dig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls
away.
Sykes BELLOWS in pain.
FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging
over the stern of the fishing boat.
He pushes to the back
of the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the
bow.
Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey
trapped.
BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
The Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back
at what the sun-gun spotlights.
He sees Harcourt standing
at the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in.
CAPTAIN
Hey!
FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Harcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him.
He reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby.
He rears back
with it and lets it fly like a spear.
BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
The gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest.
The Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back
against the throttle.
The boat lunges forward as the
engines REV loudly.
FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes.
As
Harcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie
line on the dinghy.
He lunges forward, throwing the
ratchet.
The line plays out, and the dinghy slides
backward into water!
DINGHY - NIGHT
The dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie
line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat.
Harcourt claws his way toward Sykes.
Water is already
splashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is
sinking.
Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward
him.
Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his
might.
Harcourt yanks him free.
Sykes kicks wildly at
the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the
line.
Harcourt is coming in for the kill when--
-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever.
The rest
of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the
dinghy from the fishing boat!
The dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast.
A wave from
the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side.
Some
of it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away.
Sykes
sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is
on him again.
Sykes' body weight at the side of the
dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to
wash in over the transom.
DINGHY - NIGHT
Harcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in
agony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water
touches.
Sykes is taking one hell of a beating.
Harcourt
sweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib
cage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt
off balance.
Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the
first time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of
them tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the
dinghy.
WATER - NIGHT
Sykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically
clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still
above the water.
Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's
partially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top
of Sykes, and drags him under.
WATER - NIGHT
Sykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a
body unmoving but still on top of him.
Sykes shoves it
away, struggling to stay afloat.
His head keeps dunking
under.
He's drowning.
WATER AND HELICOPTER - NIGHT
The helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water.
Jetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking
under again.
The helicopter's skids are three feet above
the water.
JETSON
(to Pilot)
ALL THE WAY!
PILOT
I CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!
Sykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but
the skid is just too high.
Jetson has no alternative, and
he does the bravest thing he has ever done.
He moves out
onto the narrow helicopter skid.
Hanging on, three feet
above the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching
hand.
The fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from
each other... Jetson stretches farther, farther... and the
two hands meet!
Jetson winces from the pain of the
seawater on Sykes' hand.
He starts pulling Sykes up.
When--
HARCOURT'S HEAD BREAKS THE SURFACE A FOOT FROM SYKES'
FACE.
His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly
gone.
The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes,
breaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under
again.
Jetson is frantic.
He keeps waiting -- but this time
Sykes doesn't come up.
Jetson doesn't know what to do.
Finally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot
from the water, SCREAMS to block the pain, and plunges his
own arm below the surface!
He feels around, gets hold of
something, and pulls.
It is Sykes' wrist.
He pulls hard,
bringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water.
JETSON
(to Pilot)
Take it up!
The Pilot does.
Sykes comes up out of the water.
His
feet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand
and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle.
Sykes looks down in horror.
The helicopter keeps moving
up, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm
tears away from the torso at the shoulder.
Sykes wildly
shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it
falls back into the water below.
Jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it
moves off toward shore.
