      DOGS AND CATS in WIRE CAGES BARK and HISS.  Nearby, we find 
      THE SCREAMING MAN, LENNY (30s, thuggish), a LARGE SCREWDRIVER 
      protruding from an engorged bump on his forehead.  His hands 
      secured to a table by rubber straps, normally used for dogs.  

                                  GRACE (OUR NARRATOR)
                    Jesus, Lenny, stop moving -- !

      PULL BACK to meet DR. GRACE DEVLIN (30s) grown up.  She s in 
      street clothes, covered with a surgical smock and gloves -- 
        street-wise, self-assured, and headstrong, especially when 
      dealing with guys like Lenny, who s delirious from the pain.

                                  LENNY
                    The thing is in my head!

                                  GRACE
                    Next time don t rob a hardware 
                    store when you re drunk. 

      Just then, DR. FRANK (50), a veterinarian, enters from the 
      adjacent room.  Grace looks up --

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Did you give him the Fentanyl?   

                                  DR. FRANK
                    Enough to knock out a Great Dane.

                                  LENNY
                          (panicked; to Grace)
                    Doc, no one can know I m here --  

                                  GRACE
                    That makes two of us.

                                  LENNY
                    There s a warrant out for me and -- 

                                  GRACE
                    Shut up.  I m trying to think --

                                  LENNY
                    Moretti said you won t tell anyone.  
                    Said you owe him big time and --

      It s true, but doesn t like hearing it.  Thinking aloud --

                                  GRACE
                    No slurred speech or paraesthesia -- 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)    Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      3.

      Grace grabs a nearby STAPLER and WHACKS it against Lenny s 
      knee cap, harder than necessary, to elicit a KICK REFLEX.

                                  LENNY
                    What the hell!

                                  GRACE
                    Patellar reflexes are normal.
                          (to Lenny, re: screwdriver)
                    You got lucky.  Just hit the 
                    frontal lobe. 

      Just then, Grace s CELL PHONE RINGS:  RIIIING!

                                  LENNY
                    I m hearing bells!

                                  GRACE
                    That s my cell.  Means my break s 
                    over and I gotta get back to the 
                    hospital.

                                  LENNY
                    You can t leave me!

                                  GRACE
                    I m not here for you; I m here  cuz 
                    of Moretti.  If it were up to me, 
                    I d pound this in another inch and 
                    call it a day --   

                                  LENNY
                    Doc, please --

                                  GRACE
                          (to Dr. Frank)
                    Douse him with betadine and let s 
                    do this.

      As Dr. Frank pours the iodine-like substance on the wound, 
      Grace grabs a DOGGIE CHEW TOY and approaches Lenny with it.  

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Open wide.

      He complies; Grace stuffs the chew toy into his gaping mouth.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Now, bite down.  And remember, 
                    this ll hurt you more than me.  
                          (a beat)
                    In three... two... one!


                                                                              (CONTINUED)    Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      4.

      CONTINUED: (2)

      Lenny s eyes go wide as Grace places her hands on the 
      screwdriver and YANKS it out of his head in one swift move! 

      BLOOD SPURTS, but Grace staunches the hole with gauze pads. 
      As the gusher turns to a trickle, she turns to the vet.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                          (to Dr. Frank)
                    Sew him up.  Then give him a shot 
                    of Ancef and Tetanus.  
                          (checks watch)
                    I gotta go.  

      With that, Grace pulls off her gloves and surgery smock, 
      tosses them into the trash and blows out of there into --


      Sleek and clean.  The complete opposite of the veterinary 
      clinic.  The MUSIC emanates from iSpeakers as an African-
      American boy, KEVIN WILLIAMS (8) lies on the operating table, 
      BULLET WOUND to the chest.  EKG lines BEEP.  IV s DRIP.  He s 
      flanked by men and women in full scrubs, gowns and masks. 

      Just then, Grace enters, dressed for surgery.  She s at ease -- 
      not a hint of the adrenaline from the prior scene.  She holds 
      her hands straight up in the air (so water and bacteria flow 
      off and away).  NURSE ROBERTA  RO  ANGELI (20s), Grace s best 
      friend, clocks her and announces --

                                  RO
                    Good afternoon, Dr. Devlin.

      CONTINUED:

      As Ro holds up gloves, Grace aggressively pushes her hands 
      inside each one --

                                  RO (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    Where the hell ve you been?

                                  GRACE
                    Car trouble. 

                                  RO
                    Again?

      As Ro ties Grace s surgical gown, ANESTHESIOLOGIST MIKE (40s) 
      interjects --    

                                    ANESTHESIOLOGIST MIKE
                    Prepped and ready.  Pressure s 110 
                    over 70.

      Grace eyes the patient, noting the field marked for surgery.

                                  GRACE
                    I m going to need a bigger field.  

                                  RO
                    No problem.

      As Ro widens the circumference of flesh around the wound, 
      Grace follows with the scalpel, making the incision.  Then -- 

                                  GRACE
                      Retractor. 

      Ro hands the retractor to Grace, who slides the tool between 
      muscle and bone.  A beat as she searches for something.

                                    ANESTHESIOLOGIST MIKE
                    Who shoots an eight-year-old kid?

                                  GRACE

                                  GRACE
                    Big gun, little discretion.

      Then, as she gently pries out A BLOODIED BULLET --    



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      6.

                    Got it.

      Satisfied, she drops the gnarled metal in a tray.  But 
      suddenly, the EKG pulse TRIPLES:  Beepbeepbeep! 

                                    ANESTHESIOLOGIST MIKE
                    Jesus, he s tachy --

      ALARMS WHINE.  The pulse ox monitor s PITCH starts to lower.  
      People scramble.  Still Grace stays cool. 

                                  GRACE
                    Give me suction and forceps. 

      The team s responding, when attending DR. BOB FLANIGAN (late 
      40s, arrogant) charges in through the door, accompanied by a 
      fifth year resident, DR. OLIVIA WATSON (30s) -- classically 
      pretty, poised, and a chip on her shoulder. 

                                  DR. BOB FLANIGAN
                    Grace, you re here.  Status?

      FAST ANGLES ON the OPEN CHEST CAVITY, as Grace goes in with 
      the Mayo scissors and clamp... Then on THE BOY S HEART, outer 
      sack grossly swollen like a bullfrog -- until Grace snips it 
      with the scissors and REDDISH YELLOW FLUID GUSHES OUT. 

      Almost immediately, the  beepbeep  of the EKG slows and the 
      pulse ox monitor rises in pitch, back to normal.

      Grace nods, sweat on brow, relieved, but still focused on the 
      task before her, as she starts to stitch the tiny laceration.   
      ACROSS THE WAY, Dr. Flanigan looks like he just ate a bug.

      REVEAL DR. STAFFORD WHITE (50s), the medical center s Surgery 
      Chief, as he hustles up with TWO NURSES, who usher Severino 
      and his  entourage  around a corner.  Grace keeps staring 
      after them.  Snapped out of it by --

                    Chief, she just finished her 24.

                                  DR. WHITE
                    And?

                    ACGME rules: after twenty-four

                    Good rules.
                          (to Grace; leading)
                    Doctor, you re  off  rotation but 
                    you re not  gone  if --

                    Good.  I ll see you in fifteen. 

      With a look to Ro, Dr. White blows out of there.

      As Grace heads off, Ro dogs her --

                          (excitedly)
                    So, you recognize your new patient?

                                  GRACE
                    Sure do.

      As they head into --

      Grace and Ro enter the break room...

                                  RO 
                    He s been all over the news.  TV.   
                    Internet.  They say he s gonna 
                    bring down the Southside Outfit. 

      As Ro pours a cup of coffee, Grace ends the discussion with -- 

                                  GRACE 
                    Yeah, I ve heard.

                          (sing-song) 
                    There you are, doctor. 

      They turn to REVEAL -- MARIA DEVLIN (50s), Grace s mom,  
      striding in like she owns the place.  Maria is a cancer  
      survivor, and her near-death experience informs her 
      relationships.  For Maria, life is too short not to be 
      direct, honest, and a bit of a drama queen.  If Grace doesn t 
      look happy to see her, it s because she s not.

                    I m here about Suzie Norton. 

      Before Grace can ask, Maria explains to Ro --

                                  MARIA (CONT D)
                    Grace used to baby-sit her.  Sweet 
                    girl, but poor thing -- her parents 
                    split when she was 5.  Her mother 
                    took off with our lesbian butcher -- 
                    spitting image of Valerie 
                      Bertinelli, swear to God.

                                  GRACE
                          (losing her patience)
                    What happened to Suzie?

                                  MARIA
                    She showed up at the house, looking 
                    for you.  Said she didn t feel so 
                    good.  I told her you weren t home, 
                    then she passed out right in front 
                    of me.  I called 9-1-1, and rode in 
                    the ambulance with her.

                                  GRACE
                    Is she okay?

                                  MARIA
                    How should I know?
                          (pointedly)
                    But your doctor friend is taking 
                    care of her.  He s even cuter than 
                    that photo I found on your laptop. 
                          (to Ro)
                    You know, she won t introduce us.

      blood IVs wind down to her arms, as DR. BRETT ROBINSON (30s), 
      handsome blueblood, runs a transducer over her exposed

                    So, you met my mother.

                    Yeah.  She told me I had great bone 
                    structure but my sideburns are too 
                    long for my face.  Then, she asked

      Before Grace can respond, A NURSE enters with a file.

                    Excuse me, Doctor, lab results --

                    No, Grace.  I mean, this can t be 
                    right.  I tried to do a pelvic, but 
                    her hymen s in tact.  She s a 
                    virgin.

      Grace reacts -- stunned, when THE HOSPITAL P.A. ANNOUNCES...

                    But unless that s an immaculate 
                      conception, you better check again. 

      Grace gives Brett a quick peck on the lips and hurries out.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The Chicago Skyline is visible out the fifth floor window as, 
      ACROSS THE WAY, X-RAYS and MRI CARDIO DISPLAYS gleam on a 
      bank of state-of-the-art FLAT SCREENS.

      NEARBY, FBI AGENT ANDREWS hands a file to Grace, who s there 
      with Dr. White.  IN THE FILE, a series of photos -- mug shots, 
      news clippings, etc. of Ralph Severino (guy on gurney).

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    Do you recognize this man?

      Grace acts nonchalant, but she knows all about this patient.  
      She takes a breath, then, does her best to sound casual --

                                  GRACE
                    Ralph Severino.  He s a witness in 
                    some big trial.  Everyone thought 
                    he was dead, but you had him in 
                    witness protection  til last week.  

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    That s right.  Mr. Severino is a 
                    former lieutenant of Southside mob 
                    boss, Tommy Moretti -- 

      We ve heard this name before.  Still, Grace doesn t react --




                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      15.

                    Sounds like Al Capone stuff. 

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    You re not far off.  Moretti s crew 
                    has been connected to over sixty 
                    deaths and disappearances, plus 
                    thefts, briberies...  Severino was 
                    our key to proving it all, until he 
                      face-planted in court this morning. 

      Grace notes a pair of the PHOTOS -- in the first Severino is 
      200 lbs; in the second, the guy is pushing 300.

                                  GRACE
                    And plaque in his arteries. 

      Grace points to ONE OF THE CARDIO MRI S -- on an off-white 
      field, gray arteries are dappled with BRIGHT CLUMPS (plaque).  

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    We need him to testify. 

                                  DR. WHITE

                    His coronaries are tortuous, seven 
                    narrowed arteries.

                    He needs a  cabbage .

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    Will he make it?

                                  DR. WHITE
                    I can t say.  He s high risk.  Not 
                    to mention, his carotids are 
                    occluded.  Even if he survives the 
                      procedure, there s a chance of 
                    memory loss, given the length of 
                    time he ll be connected to the 
                      heart-lung machine.

      Andrews does not look happy.  A beat.  Then, Grace offers --

                                  GRACE
                    We could do the  cabbage  off-pump. 

                                  DR. WHITE 
                    Dr. Devlin just finished a rotation 
                    at the Cleveland Clinic where she 
                    studied with the doctor who invented 
                    the procedure.  It allows the 
                    surgeon to stop each area of the 
                    heart locally to perform the 
                    grafting.

                                  GRACE
                    Increases his odds and no worries 
                    about memory loss.  

                                  DR. WHITE
                    But it s new, and it s never been 
                    done at this hospital.

                                  GRACE
                    There s always a first time.  It s 
                    why you sent me there, Sir.

                                  DR. WHITE
                          (considers)
                    Alright.
                          (to Andrews)
                    She d lead, I d supervise. 

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    How soon?

                                  GRACE
                    We ll wait for the anticoagulants 
                    to wear off and his INR to 
                      normalize. 

                                  DR. WHITE 
                    Around twelve to twenty-four hours.

      Agent Andrews regards them both, measuring.  Then...

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                      Congratulations, doctors -- you ve

      Andrews shakes Grace s hand and, together with White, exits.  
      We STAY WITH Grace, as she returns to Severino s charts and 
      MRIs.  Just then, Ro pops in, checking to see Grace is alone.   

                                  RO
                    Hey.  You got somethin . 

      Ro steps all the way in, holding a BOUQUET OF BALLOONS and A 
      CARD, with the name  Grace  scribbled on the front.   

                                  RO (CONT D)
                    What s the occasion?

                                  GRACE
                    No idea.

                                  RO
                    Knowing your boo, it s just to let

                          (off Grace)
                    I m so jealous, I could puke. 

      Grace smiles, then excitedly opens the card.  Color drains 
      from her face.  Ro notices.  

                                  RO (CONT D)
                    Is everything okay?

                    Sure.  Fine.  Everything s fine. 

      She closes the card... but not before WE SEE WHAT S WRITTEN:

                           KILL HIM  

      OFF Grace, shaken to the core --

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Grace s PICKUP SPEEDS toward a THREE GARAGE DOOR WAREHOUSE 
      surrounded by chainlink.  Inside, a dozen cars in various 
      stages of repair.  WELDERS slice and dice.  As sparks fly...

      Grace stops by a black MASERATI with personalized  MORETTI  
      plates, exits the truck and bee-lines for an open bay... when 
      handsome, built FRANCO (30s) steps from the shadows -- 

                                  FRANCO
                    Hey Doc -- 

                                  GRACE
                          (slowing)
                    I m here for Moretti.

      Grace tries to get past him into the darkened bay, but Franco 
      steps in front of her.  The man is sexy and it s clear he has 
      a past with Grace.  That being said, Grace is all business.

                                  FRANCO
                    You re always trying to get away 
                    from me.

                                  GRACE
                    Why re you still working for him, 
                    Franco?  You could do better.

                                  FRANCO
                    I made a 100G s in three months.

                                  GRACE
                    It s not all about money.

                                  FRANCO
                    Says the woman who s gonna clear 
                    half a mil in 2 years.
                          (off her confusion)
                    Your mom s proud of you.  So am I.

      Franco is sincere, and we see a glimpse of a connection, but 
      he s from Grace s past and she s trying to move forward --

                                  GRACE
                    Great.  Now get out of my way.
                          (off his look)
                    Moretti?!  MORETTI -- ?!


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      19.

      A VOICE COMES out of the blackness.

                                    MORETTI (O.S.)
                    Jesus!  Let her in -- 

      Franco shakes his head and steps back as Grace lightly pushes 
      him out of the way.  Eyes on her -- no doubt, he still has 
      feelings for her -- he watches Grace head into the bay and...


      Grace enters a Hades of car parts: metal saws and sparks.  
      Stepping past the welders, and their hulking supervisor GINO 
      (30s), she reaches a switchblade of a man with slick hair and 
      a crazy expensive jacket -- we recognize him as the FBI s 
      main target, TOMMY MORETTI (early 40s), highly agitated. 

                                    MORETTI 
                          (to Grace)
                    You re not supposed to be here.

                                  GRACE
                    Killing a man -- is not what I 
                    agreed to...

                                    MORETTI
                    So you got my balloons.  

                                  GRACE
                    I m not doing it.  No way will I --

                                    MORETTI
                    Christ, would you shut up?!

      Quickly grabbing Grace by the arm, Moretti pulls her into... 


      Desks, a computer, file cabinets, girly calendars.  Classy.  
      Moretti SLAMS the door and shoves Grace to the wall. 

                                    MORETTI 
                    You and me have a deal --  

      Moretti is pissed but Grace doesn t back off.

                                  GRACE
                    Stitch a cut, patch a bullet, pry a 
                      screwdriver from a dimwit s skull, 
                    but not this --

                    No loopholes...  

      Moretti starts to pace like an animal. 

                                    MORETTI (CONT D)
                    You understand Severino s fat trap 
                    can put me away forever?  My 
                    friggin  life is on the line, and 
                    that piece-a-crap informant s 
                    gettin  a free pass. 

      Just then, her CELL PHONE RINGS.  Grace knows the tone.  

                                  GRACE
                    That s the hospital.

                    I have to get to work.

      Moretti blocks her way, grows serious --

                    If you don t want me pulled off his 
                    case -- move, now.   

      As Moretti complies and Grace pushes past him, he calls out --

                                    MORETTI
                    I ll be in touch.

      Grace walks down the hall, looking stressed.  

      As she steps up to Room 203, she takes a breath and then -- 
      doing her best to push back the thought of Moretti and keep 
      everything together -- she enters into...     


      Young Kevin Williams lies in bed, hooked to assorted monitors 
      and IVs with his chest bandaged.  His kind mother -- BETTY 
      WILLIAMS (40s) -- is in a chair beside him. 

                                  GRACE
                    Look who s had his chest tube

      From behind her back, Grace holds up A TEDDY BEAR DRESSED IN

                    in range.  He s doing great.

      Just then, Dr. Bob Flanigan (the attending surgeon from the 
      Teaser) pops his head in the door.

                                  DR. BOB FLANIGAN
                    Dr. Devlin -- a word?

                          (to Kevin and his mom)
                    Excuse me.

      Still holding the chart, Grace follows Flanigan to --


      -- where Flanigan leads Grace over to Dr. Olivia Watson, who 
      we met during Kevin s surgery.

                    What s going on?

                                  DR. BOB FLANIGAN
                    Chief says we need to lighten your 
                    load on account of this FBI thing; 
                    I m giving this post-op to Watson. 

      Olivia reaches for the chart.  Grace pulls it back.

                                  GRACE
                    No disrespect, but I can handle a 
                    post-op while I wait on a patient 
                    to be ready for surgery. 

                                  DR. BOB FLANIGAN
                    It s not a request.  

      Before Grace can react, Flanigan snatches the chart from her 
      and hands it to Olivia. 

                                  DR. BOB FLANIGAN (CONT D)
                    And my baby-sitting is done. 

      As Flanigan heads off; Grace turns to Olivia... 

                                  GRACE
                    Okay.  You need to get him started 
                    on sub-cue heparin, but check his 
                    platelets first. 

                                  OLIVIA
                    I ve done this before. 

                                  GRACE
                    I get that.  It s just --

                    Just what?

                                  GRACE

      Grace gives Olivia a street smile.

      We re CLOSE ON the ANGRY FACE OF A NOW-AWAKE SUZIE NORTON.

                                  SUZIE NORTON
                    You re crazy!  That s crazy!

      She s facing off with a flummoxed Dr. Brett Robinson.

                                  BRETT
                    Ms. Norton -- 

                                  SUZIE NORTON

                      Technically but --

                    What do you mean  technically ?  I 
                    know how it works, I m fourteen.

                                  BRETT
                    Like I said, you have a fimbriated

                    God, shut up with that!   

      Just then the door to the room opens and Grace enters.  Brett 
      and Grace share a look.  It s clear she s overheard --

                                  GRACE
                    Am I interrupting?

                    No offense.  

      Grace and Brett can t help but share a smile. 

                                  BRETT
                    Suzie, I ve gotta finish my rounds.  
                    Why don t you counsult Dr. Devlin. 

      As Brett exits, he whispers to Grace --

      As he hands Suzie s file to Grace.

                                  BRETT
                          (re: Suzie)
                    Good luck.

      Brett takes off; Grace glances at the file as she approaches 
      Suzie.  She sits by the edge of her bed.

                                  SUZIE NORTON
                    What was that?  Do you have a thing

                    Joey Vacca.  But we never had sex.  
                    I m not an idiot.

                                  GRACE

                    See, because of your anatomy -- 
                    something called a fimbriated hymen 
                    -- you re like the Death Star, with 
                    an  airduct  that has the potential 
                    to be penetrated -- even when 
                    you re not doin  it, full on.

                                  SUZIE NORTON

                    You knew Moretti s reputation.  Your 
                    eyes were wide open.

      Danny knows she s right.  With concern --

                                  DANNY
                    What s he want from you, now?

      A beat.  Will she tell him?  Making a decision --

                                  GRACE
                    You don t wanna know.

      Just then her phone CHIMES with a text.  Grace reads it. 

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    I gotta go. 

                                  DANNY

                    Where else?

      And as Grace turns to head back down the stairs...

                    And so a twist in the Government s 
                    ongoing case against the Chicago 
                    Outfit s Southside faction.  
                      Convicting Moretti would represent 
                    the biggest victory since 1993 --

      ON THE TV -- Footage comes up of an imposing man in his late 
      30s, ALEXANDER CONSTANTINE, led from a courthouse in cuffs.

                                  NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    -- when legendary boss Alexander 
                      Constantine was sent to prison on 
                      racketeering charges, setting the 
                    stage for the power vacuum filled 
                    by Constantine s then second-in-
                    command, Tommy Moretti.

      Now comes A NEWS SHOT OF TOMMY MORETTI, emerging from a 
      courthouse, beaming like a Chicago John Gotti.  BACK TO --

                                  NEW ANCHOR
                      Constantine, who was released from 
                    prison in June, has since gone on to 
                    support a number of Chicago s youth 
                    outreach programs...

      ANOTHER NEWS SHOT shows a still-fit but OLDER CONSTANTINE 
      stepping up to make a statement in front of a Parole Board. 

                                    CONSTANTINE (ON TV)
                    I know I did wrong.  But with God s 
                    help I m tryin  to make good.   

      S/FX: INTERCOM BUZZER RINGS.  THE MAN, who s been watching 
      the TV, presses a button marked  FRONT GATE .  Then, he 
      reaches for a REMOTE and clicks OFF the TV.  CAMERA SWINGS 
      around to REVEAL:  ALEXANDER CONSTANTINE (early 50s), in the 
      flesh, and just as imposing as in the initial news footage.   

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE TOP OF A BOTTLE marked  LANTUS - INSULIN GLARGINE  gets 
      wiped clean with a alcohol swab.  Next, A SYRINGE NEEDLE is 
      pushed through the container s stopper, into the bottle.  Air 
      is pushed out of the syringe; insulin is drawn in.  

      ANGLE ADJUSTS to reveal Grace, standing by Constantine in the 
      kitchen, an INSULIN KIT between them.

                    The Lantus seems to be working, but 
                    you cut it close with the timing.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Sue me.  I hate needles.

                    You like the hospital better?

                                    CONSTANTINE 
                    As long as it doesn t have bars on 
                    the windows --  

      Grace smiles -- then injects his arm.  Constantine doesn t 
      flinch, keeping his eyes on her.  There s a sense they ve 
      done this dozens and dozens of times before.

      As Grace withdraws the needle and applies a swab, she spots a 
      FRAMED CHICAGO TRIBUNE ARTICLE --  THE FALL OF ALEXANDER  -- 
      complete with A PHOTO of a handcuffed Alexander Constantine 
      being led from the downtown Chicago Courthouse. 

                                  GRACE
                    Why d you frame it, anyway? 

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    To remind me of my mistakes.
                          (changes topics)
                    How s your mom?

                                  GRACE
                    You really want to go there?

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Not nice. 

      Grace takes a beat.  She appreciates that Constantine defends 
      her mother.  She corrects herself for his benefit.

                                  GRACE
                    She stopped by the hospital for a 
                    visit.  Introduced herself to the 
                    guy I m dating and asked if he was 
                    the marrying type.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    What d he say?

                                  GRACE

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Why?

                                  GRACE
                    I saved a boy s life today.  I 
                    opened his chest and I closed up 
                    all the holes.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    You like feeling powerful. 

      Constantine eyes the article in the frame, but Grace doesn t 
      like the implication of comparing a doctor to a mob boss...

                                  GRACE
                    I like making a difference.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                    Lord Acton, 19th Century 
                      philosopher, said: Power corrupts 
                    and absolute power --

                                  GRACE
                    -- corrupts absolutely.  I know.  
                    But, like I said, it s not about 
                     power .  It s helping people.

                                    CONSTANTINE
                          (dubious)
                    Uh huh.

      Grace tries to brush that off.  She turns her attention to 
      the insulin kit.  As she packs it up, Constantine slides her 
      an ENVELOPE OF CASH.  

                                  GRACE
                    You re over paying me.  Anyone 
                    could give you these shots.

      Grace gives him a gentle peck on the forehead and goes.  He 
      calls after her --

      INSIDE ROOM 203

      There s a HOSPITAL CHAPLAIN kneeling by Betty Williams, who s 
      wracked with sobs on a chair, an empty bed... and there, in 
      the corner, Kevin s  Superbear  toy on the ground. 

      Nearby, Grace spots a lone CODE WHITE NURSE closing up a 
      crash cart.  She catches her eye.  The nurse just shakes her 
      head.  OFF Grace, looking like she s been gut punched...

                    Sorry, Bob.  I didn t page you.

                    Nope, not a mistake.
                          (as they turn to her)

                    Under ACGME rules, I should be off 
                    and gone, anyway.

      Flanigan scoffs, but White hesitates, thinking this over...

                    Stafford, you re not actually

                    Monday.

      Grace nods, satisfied.  Flanigan, however, can barely hold it 
      together.  As he heads off, he passes Grace --

      Grace shrugs, gives a nod to Dr. White, and heads back to --


      As Grace strides down the hall, she sees blue collar JEFF 
      NORTON (40s), Suzie s father, taking to Ro.  She calls out --

                    What exactly s wrong with her?

      Just as Brett is about to respond, Grace blurts -- 

                                  GRACE
                    It s a hemorragic ovarian cyst. 

                                  MR. NORTON
                    A cyst?

      Brett turns to Grace, stunned by her brazen lie.  

                                  GRACE 
                    It s ruptured.  We need to operate

                    Oh God... 

                                  GRACE
                    It sounds worse than it is.  And 
                    again, your daughter is in

                                  GRACE
                    What s going on?

                                    MORETTI 
                    Here s the fix.  In the operating 
                    room, the saline bags all have 
                    black caps.  For Severino s 
                      operation, one of those bags will 
                    have a red cap.  Use that bag.    

                                  GRACE
                    Why?  What s in it...? 

                                    MORETTI
                      Epinephrine.    

                                  GRACE
                          (spooked; getting it)
                    Enough to cause a coronary vasospasm 
                    and since epinephrine is used in 
                    emergency resuscitation, the coroner 
                    will assume it came from us trying 
                    to save him --

                                    MORETTI
                    But it s actually what killed him.  
                    Time to do your job, Grace.

      That said, Moretti hangs up.  We STAY WITH Grace, who focuses 
      on SEVERINO S PHOTO, knowing the man s life is in her hands.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      The beep-beep-beep of an EKG brings us into a new day -- and 
      Ralph Severino s operation.  

      AT THE TABLE -- Dr. White, Anesthesiologist Mike and a trio 
      of nurses including Ro, all in the process of getting set up 
      around the big unconscious body of Ralph Severino, whose mid- 
      chest is exposed.   

      IN THE GALLERY -- Brett and Olivia and Agent Andrews...

      THEN, BACK IN THE OPERATING THEATER

      Grace enters in her scrubs and looks around nervously.  
      Amidst the medical staff on the floor, she spots a RACK OF 
      SALINE BAGS... ONE WITH THE RED CAP.  Jesus.  

                                  DR. WHITE
                    Good morning, Dr. Devlin.  

      Grace looks up fast.  Dr. White s all business, holding a 
      purple marker. 

                                  DR. WHITE (CONT D)
                    Mark before you scrub?

                                  GRACE
                          (trying to keep cool)
                    Sure.  Sixth intercostal looks good 
                    to me. 

      Grace takes the marker and makes a line for her first 
      incision on Severino s pale skin.  Then, handing the marker 
      off to a nurse, she heads to the saline rack.  She pauses a 
      beat.  Looks around one more time, then grabs THE ONE WITH 
      THE RED CAP and she jacks it into the line to Severino!  

                                  RO
                      Pressure s one-sixty.

      Grace nods and walks for the scrub room, passing by the head 
      of Severino s table when BEEPBEEPBEEP!  Severino SEIZES 
        grotesquely.  

                                    ANESTHESIOLOGIST MIKE
                    Jesus, he s coding -- !



                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      45.

      CONTINUED:

      Severino TORQUES his body in agony, knocking over the 
      instrument tray with a CLATTER!

                                  RO
                    Cart!

      Nurses scramble to get the CRASH CART as CHAOS erupts.  
      Still, in the middle of it, Grace stands frozen.

                                    ANESTHESIOLOGIST MIKE 
                    Dr. Devlin?  Grace!

      Still, there s no response.  Dr. White snaps into action... 

                                  DR. WHITE 
                    Get me an amp of epi and bicarb!

                                  RO
                    He s in v-fib!  Paddles -- !

                                  DR. WHITE
                    Grace, get out of the way -- 

      White powers-up DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES, ready to give Severino 
      a jolt -- when suddenly the mob witness YANKS the tube out of 
      his mouth, LUNGES UP and GRABS GRACE BY THE COLLAR! 

                                  SEVERINO
                    GHAAAA!

      Grace SCREAMS, her own voice mixing with his FLATLINE and...

                                                                    HARD CUT TO:


      Grace, covered in sweat, bolts awake from HER DREAM to find 
      her cell phone and pager BUZZING and BEEPING.  She checks the 
      time on the pager: 6:00 AM.  She grabs the phone.  

                                  GRACE
                    Dr. Devlin.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


      Dr. White, flanked by a nurse, hovers over Severino.  He s on 
      his cell with Grace --

                                  DR. WHITE 
                      Severino s I.N.R is normal.  It s 
                    showtime, Grace.  

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      46.

                                  GRACE
                    On my way.

      Grace rolls out of bed and starts throwing on clothes.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The beep-beep-beep of an EKG brings us into the real O.R.   
      Or so we hope.  

      Ralph Severino s on the table, surrounded by Dr. White, Mike, 
      Ro and other nurses.  UP IN THE GALLERY -- Agent Andrews.

      That s when Grace enters in her scrubs.  She scans the room -- 
      as she did in her dream.  Everything is much less surreal, 
      but still tense... Especially as Grace clocks the SALINE BAG 
      WITH THE RED CAP.  She checks Severino -- he s unconscious 
      and still.  Whew.

                                  DR. WHITE
                    Good morning, Dr. Devlin.  

      Grace looks up.  Dr. White s holding that purple marker. 

                                  DR. WHITE (CONT D)
                    Mark before you scrub?

                                  GRACE
                    Sure. 

      Grace takes the marker and makes the line on Severino s skin.  

      Then, handing the marker off to a nurse, she heads to the 
      saline rack.  Tension builds -- do we hear the beepbeepbeep 
      of the EKG increasing? -- as Grace scans the bags and, as in 
      her dream, surprises us by picking THE BAG WITH THE RED CAP. 
      Holy shit.  Is she going to kill this man?

      GRACE S P.O.V. -- She looks around the room, clocking 
      EVERYONE: White, Mike, Ro, the other nurses...  Even an 
      ORDERLY, who seems to be lingering a bit too long up in the 
      viewing gallery.    

      We can almost FEEL GRACE S STRESS as she takes the  marked 
      bag  over to connect it to the line in Severino s arm... when 
      suddenly Grace  accidentally  DROPS THE BAG TO THE GROUND 
      where it SPLATTERS.  

                                  RO
                          (jokes)
                    Spill on aisle five -- 

                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      47.

      CONTINUED:

      As A NURSE moves to clean it up, White looks to Grace.

                                  DR. WHITE 
                          (sotto)
                    You all right?  You re shaking.

      Grace realizes her hand is, in fact, shaking.  She takes a 
      deep breath.  Looks to spot where she saw the Orderly.  He s 
      gone now.  Grace shakes it off.   

                                  GRACE
                    I m fine.  Ro, grab me another 
                    saline bag, please.

      Ro grabs a BLACK-CAPPED SALINE BAG, and hooks it into 
      Severino s IV line.  As the beep-beep-beep steadies, we go 
      OFF the bright white O.R. lights beaming down on everyone...  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      DOORS to the operating theater swing open and Grace emerges, 
      with a proud Dr. White by her side.  Both of them pull off 
      their masks, as FBI Agent Andrews approaches.

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    That looked good.  Was it good?

                                  DR. WHITE
                          (turns to Grace)
                    Dr. Devlin -- ?

                                  GRACE
                    The operation was textbook.

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    Thank you.  Both of you.

      As Andrews walks off, Dr. White turns to Grace --

                                  DR. WHITE
                    I ve never seen you so nervous 
                    before a procedure.

                                  GRACE
                    I m sorry.

                                  DR. WHITE
                    Don t be.  A life was in your hands.

                    heart surgeries?

                                  DR. WHITE
                    Yes, and a good surgeon never 
                    forgets that.
                          (beat)
                    Now we need to talk about Flanigan.

                                  DR. WHITE
                    Agreed.  But the most he s gonna 
                    get from the Board is a slap on 
                    this wrist.  Then he s back to 
                    being your boss.  Think you can  
                    handle that?

                          (a beat; double meaning)
                    I ve handled worse.  I need a 
                    shower. 

      As Dr. White watches Grace head into the LOCKER ROOM --


      Moments later, Grace, hair wet from her shower, is putting on 
      her civvies, when she looks up to SEE Olivia, pissed.    

                                  OLIVIA
                    I told you I didn t want Flanigan  
                      written-up. 

                                  GRACE
                    He didn t get  written up .

                                  OLIVIA
                    No -- you called him out in front 
                    of the Chief of Surgery and now 
                    Flanigan blames me.   

                                  GRACE
                    Why you?

      Under this Brett enters, unseen at first.  He s wearing a 
      leather jacket over his surgical scrubs.  He observes --


                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      49.

                                  GRACE

                    That s right.  You didn t think -- 

      Just then, Brett opens a locker and Olivia and Grace realize 
      he s been listening.  They don t know how much he s heard.

                                  OLIVIA (CONT D)
                    Perfect.  Your knight in shining 
                    armor.  How are you going to defend 
                    her this time?

      Brett eyes Grace, still peeved at her from their last 
        conversation re: Suzie Norton.

                                  BRETT
                    Who says I am?

      Brett s implicitly given Olivia the  okay  to continue --

                                  OLIVIA
                    Grace, I realize you re a plucky 
                      Bridgeport girl who pulled herself 
                    up by her bootstraps to become a 
                    big city doctor.  But you re no 
                    better than anyone else here, and 
                    at the end of the day, we all want 
                      colleagues who have our backs.  No 
                    one wants to work with a rat.

      With that, Olivia takes off.  Grace shakes her head, then 
      looks to Brett, expecting support.  Instead --

                    I m glad you exposed Flanigan, but I

      Brett hangs his jacket in a locker, slams it, and takes off.   
      Grace feels badly and calls after him --

                                  GRACE
                    Brett -- 
                          (considers, then...)
                    Damn it.

      Hurrying to pull on her shoes, Grace heads after him --


      Grace rushes out of the locker room and races after Brett.  
      She s intercepted by FBI Agent Andrews -- 

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    Dr. Devlin, can I have a word?

                                  GRACE
                    Umm... Sure...

      As she eyes Brett turning a corner --

                                  AGENT ANDREWS
                    When do you think we can get him 
                    back on the stand?

                                  GRACE
                    I can t say.  A lot depends on the 
                    chest tube and pleural effusions... 

      Just then, Grace s cell phone RINGS.  The CALLER ID:  MOM . 

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Excuse me.  I have to take this.  
                          (steps away from Andrews)
                    Mom?

                    Moretti.

      Moretti talks on the house phone as Maria, terrified, sits on 
      the sofa, out of earshot.  Moretti brandishes a .38.

                                    MORETTI 
                    Heard our chatty friend made it to 
                    post-op.  What went wrong, Grace?   

                                  GRACE
                    Where s my mother?

                                    MORETTI 
                    Not far.  Came looking for Danny, 
                    but she answered the door --

      BACK WITH GRACE as she looks toward Agent Andrews.  What to 
      do?  Quickly, she turns for the other direction: the EXIT.

                                  GRACE
                    Let me talk to her.

                                    MORETTI
                    Come and get her.

      The LINE DROPS DEAD.  Grace races for the EXIT.  WITH AGENT 
      ANDREWS as he watches Grace, hurrying off.  For a moment, he 
      seems confused, then he looks down at his own Smart Phone.  
      ON THE SCREEN a series of PHOTOS of Grace -- the ones taken 
      earlier, outside Constantine s home. 

      Then, we re BACK WITH Grace as she blasts out the door...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Grace (doing her best to hold everything together) finishes 
      placing A BANDAGE across an abrasion on her mom s forehead.  

                                  GRACE
                    I think you re gonna live.

                                  MARIA
                          (re: head abrasion)
                    What if it gets infected?

                                  GRACE 
                    I know a good doctor. 

      Maria grows serious.  Holds her daughter s hands --

                                  MARIA
                    Gracie, I want you to be honest 
                    with me.  What have you gotten 
                    yourself into?

      Backed into a corner, Grace contemplates her response --

                                  DANNY (O.S.)
                    It s not Grace, Ma.

      They turn as Danny enters from the kitchen, with two glasses -- 
      wine for mom, and water for Grace.  

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    It was me. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)  Untitled Berman/Wright/Dinner Pilot - 01/09/12 - NETWORK      55.

                    No, I screwed up.  I m sorry.  
                    Grace was trying to help.

      Before Maria can inquire further, Danny turns to Grace --

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    What happened to Moretti?

                                  GRACE
                    He followed me for a bit, then 
                      disappeared.

                                  DANNY
                    Where d he go?

                                  GRACE
                          (shutting him down)
                    I don t know.  Maybe he got 
                    arrested.  Maybe he left town.   

      Danny regards his sister, dubious...   

                                  DANNY
                    Moretti doesn t just back off.

                                  MARIA
                    Enough.  

                                  DANNY
                    I m just sayin  -- 

                                  MARIA
                    I m just sayin , enough. 

      Maria has laid down the law.  A beat.  Grace s phone rings;  
      she answers.

                                  GRACE
                    Dr. Devlin.

                          (hangs up, to her brother)
                    I gotta go, Danny.  Stay with Mom --

      As Grace heads off --

                                                                            CUT TO:


        A relieved-looking Mr. Norton pumps Brett s hand in thanks 
      and takes off.  A beat as Brett watches him go, then turns to 
      find Grace stepping up to him.   

                                  GRACE
                    Dr. Robinson.

                    Dr. Devlin.

      Grace nods at the departing Mr. Norton.

                                  GRACE
                    Suzie s father looks happy.  

                                  BRETT
                    The operation was a success.
                          (off Grace s silent query)
                    Cyst removal. 
                          (with a smile)
                    You re a bad influence. 

                                  GRACE
                          (feigns innocence)
                    Don t know what you mean --
                          (flirts)
                    Maybe you can explain it to me, in 
                    Call Room 2?

      Brett likes the idea, but before he can say anything Grace s 
      phone CHIMES with a text.  She checks it:  CONSTANTINE: 911 .  
      She reacts and Brett clocks it...  

                                  BRETT
                      Everything all right?

                          (reluctant)
                    Yeah.  But... I have to take care 
                    of something.  I m sorry.

      Grace gives him a kiss.  It lingers.  Then --

                    When I get back, I want to know how
