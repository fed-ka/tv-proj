CLOSE SHOT:
A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy
but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe.
His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough
man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks.
His name is EDDIE BLACK.
In the distance a foghorn moans.
We are pulling back.
BLACK
Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell
him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell

The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge
empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of
his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty
space.
The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches
falling into darkness.

gagged, with his hands tied behind his back, a wild look
of terror in his dead eyes.
DURANT AND GUZMAN
gape stupidly at the body before them. They glance
fearfully to one another through the fog of gunsmoke.
DURANT
looks about, gets control, loads a fresh clip into his
gun with an echoing SNAP.
GUZMAN
waves his arms in surrender.
GUZMAN
Good Bye. Das it. I'm outta here...
Durant grabs him.
DURANT
Where the hell are you going?
GUZMAN
pulls free.

Lit by the flying blue sparks it emits an evil laugh.
Tunnel walls zip past in the background.

326 PULLING DURANT
He runs, the train gigantic behind him. Durant's face is
stretched in panic. The cigar is still in his mouth,
between clenched teeth. He fixes on something ahead.

hugging the shallow depression. Is he low enough? The
underside of the train comes roaring over us.
VR00000000MI
The train begins its long roar past. We hear an AGONIZED
SCREAM that is either the train or Durant -- or some
ungodly combination.

Quiet. Durant's cigar smoulders on the tracks.

331 DURANT HIMSELF
rises quietly into frame. His suit is still clean. He
appears remarkably unscathed. He runs a hand through his
hair, turns and walks slowly along the tracks. That's
when we see his back: the train has raked off the fabric
of his suit and pants, exposing bare back and buttocks.
Somehow maintaining his dignity, Durant picks up the
smouldering cigar from the tracks. He takes a puff
and moves off.
CUT TO:

332
Darkman sits with the phone faintly ringing against his
ear. Something frantic about him, the vein in his fore-
head, faintly beating. While he waits for the other
party to answer, he cuts into the painless wound on his
arm with a surgical instrument, digging for something
. Finally Julie's voice comes on:
DARKMAN
JULIE
We cut from Darkman's ravaged monster-face to:
333
333 JULIE
beautiful as ever.
JULIE
-- Peyton! Where have you been? Why
haven't you called?

Can I--can I see you?
CLINK! The bullet is dislodged from the wound and drops
on the table.

arm draped over Julie's shoulder. She laughs with him.
Peyton glances at his watch.

Put away that watch or I'll think you
don't like me anymore. Oh, Peyton,
let's spend the whole day together --
the whole week!
A beat.
PEYTON
I've got to tell you, Julie... I've
got to tell you something about --
about me -- how I've changed.
Julie turns.

A voice offscreen rises above the general noise:

See the mutant man, half man, half

science with your own eyes!
Peyton whirls around.
PEYTON'S POV - A SIDESHOW BARKER

Peyton Ares at Julie. He can't bring himself to tell
her.
PEYTON
(SUDDENLY
IMPULSIVE)
C'mon, I'm going to win you the
biggest' fuzziest pinkiest animal doll
on that rack. Something you'll-be
truly embarrassed to own... and then
I've got to run.
They have stopped in front of a booth where softballs get
tossed at bottle pyramids. Peyton lays down a dollar and
is handed three balls.
JULIE
Why do you always have to run?
Peyton looks at the pyramid, avoiding her look. He
throws the first ball; misses. -
PEYTON
I. have my treatment... I'm not a
hundred percent cured yet--but I soon
will be.
He throws the second ball; misses.
JULIE
Can I take you back to the burn
center?
Peyton's vein begins to throb faintly.
PEYTON
No! No, please. I don't want you to
see me there. I don't want you to
think of me as...an invalid or... some
kind of f--ff-fff--FREAK!
On that word he throws the last ball with great force.
The pyramid explodes.
Peyton, breathing heavily, takes a moment to collect
himself, then says quietly to the booth attendant:

Julie tugs at his sleeve.
JULIE
Peyton, it doesn't matter.
Peyton is fighting to contain his rage. in clipped
words, between gasps for breath:

It matters. I won a pink elephant.
For my girlfriend.

Shaking under the pressure of contained rage, his vein
bulging, throbbing. Under his-breath:

The attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into Peyton's
chest.
We rocket into a close shot of the offending digits.
From of fscreen, we hear the attendant's voice:

JULIE
Please!
PEYTON

354
354 She is looking at him, frozen in horror.
355
355 His face is erupting into boils, which simmer and pop,
giving off bursts of smoke.
356
356 Peyton stares at her. Rage ebbs. His eyes become
haunted. Hoarsely:
PEYTON
Forgive me!
He runs off, the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped,
forgotten, beneath one arm.
357
357 Julie runs after him.
JULIE
Peyton!
358
There's A HORRIBLE RIPPING NOISE. Darkman is
destroying something, flailing his arms...
.CREAK.
362 DARKMAN'S EYES 362
roll toward the noise. He steps back into the shadows.
Julie slips through a warehouse window. She is
confronted by rack upon rack of clothing, shoes, body
padding, and wigs. The place looks like the wardrobe
room of a major studio.
JULIE
Peyton?!
364 No answer. She cautiously advances. Her eyes fall 364
upon something that makes her gasp.
365 THE PINK ELEPHANT 365

to brush them away. She moves forward.
JULIE

crashes to the ground, sparking.
JULIE
Do you think it was the face I cared
about?! Is that how little you think
of me?! Why didn't you come to me?

He is shaken by a silent sob. More of his face falls

hideous bone.

380 Julie looks about the dark and desolate warehouse.
The sight of the bandages. The liquid skin. The
charred Peyton/Julie photograph. Her face softens.
She feels the Darkman's pain.
QUIETLY;
JULIE
I would have helped you.
She stares into the shadows a long time without
speaking.

Strack naked except for a monogrammed bath towel
wrapd around his thickening midriff, walks across
the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment. A
Mahler symphony plays in the background.
He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that
rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the
strain of the load, he staggers back across the room
to the king-sized bed.
With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest
out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands.
They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over
the sides and clatter to the floor.
Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty,
then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the
floor.
Like a swan he dives.
He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against
flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips.
Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then
slough off, leaving their imprint.
Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving
himself with the golden coins--
A knock at the door.
Strack freezes.

Strack enters, tying his tie.
STRACK
Julie, how sweet of you to come before
our appointed hour... but I expected--
you in something a little more formal.
Didn't Ruth inform you that we have
tickets to Der Fliedermause tonight?
JULIE
I can't go, Louis. We have to talk.
STRACK
Excellent! I love to talk. Brandy?
JULIE
Thank you, no.
STRACK
I'll have one;_

STRACK
...Fair warning--it's Napoleon, and
it's quite good--

SEEING--
STRACK
OF COURSE--

Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was
burned, horribly, horribly burned--I
don't understand what happened but I
know he needs my help.
Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy
down.
STRACK
.Your news has a bittersweet
flavor... Of course I'm very happy for
you. If there's anything I can do--
the finest medical care can be at your
disposal--burn therapy, recon-
structive surgery. How badly was
he... mutilated?
Julie has broken down. She sits down on Strack's
sofa, her body wracked with sobs.
STRACK
... Where is he, Julie?
JULIE
He's living in an abandoned warehouse.
He's alone... he needs me.
The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks
it up.

STRACK
.I'm sorry you had to find that,
dear. Our relationship didn't need
this further strain.
JULIE
The fire... it wasn't an accident, it
was you.
STRACK
Not me personally. I have an employee
who does certain things for me,
unofficially, off the books. Robert
doesn't like to pay taxes.
JULIE

And now you'll kill me.

expensive police department quite
unsympathetic.

his fingers idly on the coffee-stained document. Then
he hits a button on his desk-top intercom.
STRACK
Send Robert in.
Strack strolls over to the window and stares out at
his rising city. OS the door clicks open.
ROBERT G. DURANT
enters the room.
I STRACK
Robert! I have good news and bad.
DURANT
Custom dictates that you render the
bad news first.
STRACK
You recall the little difficulty with
my father and how you resolved it. We
have a similar situation with Miss
Hastings. It seems Miss Hastings has
uncovered some unflattering
information about us.
DURANT
No problem at all. And the good news?
STRACK
Your wife died. I'm joking, of
course. No, the good news is that I
know who's behind our little troubles
of late. When you retrieved my
memorandum, you failed to excise the
good doctor.

banks sharply through the concrete canyons--a deadly
game of crack the whip.

429 SMASH!
THE DEAN
is hurled through the window of an office on the 70th
floor of a skyscraper.
430
The Darkman, still holding the rope, finds himself on
solid ground.
A BOARD MEETING
The executives stare in shock at the Darkman standing
on their table.
DARKMAN'S POV
The faces of the executives whirling in a circle like
numbers on a roulette wheel.
' 431
431 Suddenly, the faces start to recede... SMASH!... The
Darkman is yanked back out the window, breaking the
remaining glass.

DURANT
Dip him!

435 DARKMAN
is dipped into oncoming traffic. He barely clears the
roof of a Cadillac by swinging his legs above it.

436 THE HELICOPTER
swoops lower.
THE DARICMAN' S LEGS
dangle six feet above the ground, whizzing over the
asphalt at 100 miles per hour. The legs part as they
pass over a motorcycle, then close again.
437
437 THE HELICOPTER
swoops lower, slamming the Darkman to the pavement. He
drags for a moment, a pack of motorcycles WHIZZING past
his head. Like a marionette, he's jerked back up right
in front of an oncoming 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile. He is
grazed by the car's hood. His body bounces off the
windshield.
438
438 DARMAN
is lifted straight into the path of a fast-moving truck.
Truck HONKS furiously. Darkman strains his legs.
CLOSE-UP: TRACKING over the truck's aluminum roof.
CLANGITY CLANGITY CLANG
THE DARXMAN'S FEET
run 80 miles an hour along the roof of the truck.
Darkman manages to loop the bottom rung of the rope
ladder to a steel hook on the truck's cab.

Strack sits behind his power desk, talking into the
phone..
STRACK
We've consolidated the waterfront,
Governor ...Yes, I'm aware there's been
some unpleasantness but that's over
now. Yes, I'm sure. You sound a little
nervous, Bryant. Have a brandy, watch
a cop show.
The door opens. A security officer appears.
SECURITY OFFICER
Robert Durant, sir.
STRACK
(PLEASED)
Send him in.
(TO PHONE)
Goodbye, Governor. Everything's taken
care of.
He hangs up. We hear the door open and close. Strack's
smile vanishes.
ROBERT DURANT
enters. He looks awful--face scorched and bruised,
severe limp.
STRACK
You look like hell, Robert.
DURANT
The son of a bitch malfunctioned my
helicopter.
STRACK
And Westlake?

STRACK

if Westlake calls, kindly refer him to
Strack Towers.
(TO DURANT)
Come, Robert, let us kill the girl.

B446
RATTLING up the steel skeleton of a skyscraper,
P44
P446 stars all around us.
STRACK
I'm glad you survived, Robert. I'd
hate to see your kids deprived of a
role-model.
DURANT
They do look up to me.
The elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge. The
lights of the city tremble over the water. A glitter
and breadth to the landscape, an urban grandeur.
STRACK
Kids need an example, Robert. When I
was a young man my father made me work
high steel. That's how he started out,
and in his view what was good enough
for him was good enough for me...

P446 CONTIKUED
Strack gestures broadly with one arm.
STRACK
...It was just me and the Indians, no
one else crazy enough to run around up
here, against the wind, four-fifty an
hour. Sure I resented it, but now--
call me crazy--sometimes I miss it, it
sharpens your wits. Life on the edge.
Five inches wide. Two hundred fifty
feet down. High steel...
He turns to face Durant. There's a gun in his hand.
STRACK
You don't have any kids, Robert.
DURANT
What are you talking about?
STRACK
Or should I say, Doctor Westlake?
DUR ANT
I'm Durant! Robert G. Durant!
STRACK
Then I'm going to make a mistake.
There's a long beat. The vein begins to pulse on
Durant's temple. His eyes grow predatory, evil.
DURANT/ DARMAN
(RASPS)
Where's the girl?
Strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder. He smiles
back over his shoulder.
STRACK
You want to see the girl? Follow me,
I'll take you to her...
Durant/Darkman follows, taking the first few tentative
steps.

STRACK
...I must say, Dr. Westlake, you've
certainly worked some mischief.
Pretty much wiped out the security arm
of Strack Industries. That's okay.
I'm a good sport...
He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following
cautiously behind.
STRACK
...And I can handle my own problems.
I do whatever I have to do. In fact,
that's how I got my first properties.
My wife--late wife--held certain
deeds... I sent her on a plane trip
over the Smokies and well, let's just
say ;landed on My feet...
(SHRUGS)
.as for my father, well, he was old,
I spared him a few miserable years...
Yes, we all have dreams, Dr. Westlake,
but we don't all have what it takes to
realize those dreams.
DURANT/DARKMAN
All I have are nightmares.
A beat.
STRACK
Then share my dream. After all, you
and I are pretty much the same. We
should be working together. Both smart
fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in
women. I could use a man like you.
DURANT/DART AN
(RASPS)
Go to hell.
STRACK
Eventually, eventually...
He proceeds nimbly along the beam.

P446 CONTINUED(3)
STRACK
I guess you just don't have what it
takes. I gather you run around wearing
other people's faces now, since yours
is so... loathsome.
He shrugs.
STRACK
.See I could never do that. The
world has to
take me as I am. And all this tit-for-
tat stuff you've been up to. Silly.
Living in the past. ; only destroy to
build something better, whereas You..
ah, here we are.
447
447 Julie stands out on the end of a projecting girder, at
the furthest extremity of the growing building. Wind
whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically
to an upright.
DURANT/DARKMAN
Julie!
Strack laughs.
STRACK
Bring on the strings! Young lovers!
In peril! Separated by ruthless
forces, larger than they!--What a
banal tale. In it, I suppose I play
the villain. But wait, Julie--which
of us is the monster here?!
With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!!
-- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge..
448
448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind
flapping it this way and that. On the way down it slaps
against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening
out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels
away again. It spins downward towards a forest of
reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes
in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat--
pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re-bars.
165.
449
449 JULIE
gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time,
overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses
like csa y..
Strack"s tone is almost admiring:
STR.ACK
You truly are one ugly son of a bitch.
BLAM!
Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off
the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing
with rage.
THE WORLD
Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss--
GIRDER
As Darkman's fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an
I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing.
ON THE UPPER GIRDER
Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair. HIS POV--
nothing. Darkman has been swallowed up by the night.
Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie.
JULIE
recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her
hair.
STRACK
(WITH REMORSE)
First my wife, then my father, and now
YOU--
He places his hands on her shoulders, preparing to push
her off the girder. With intensity:

STRACK
-It is the tragedy of my life that I
always have to kill the ones I love.
As he's about to push her:
A VOICE BEHIND HIM
IDuis !
Strack turns around.
450
4 5 0 STRACK St.
stands behind him, glaring angrily.
STRACK JR.
Father?
STRACK SR.
(HORRIBLE RASP)
I should've snuffed you out at birth!
With that Strack Sr. rips off his own face, exposing
the enraged visage of Darkman... Strack reaches for
his gun.
451
451 BAM!
Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his
hand into the darkness below.
STRACK AND DARXMAN
OF
battle it out on the narrow girder, hundreds of feet
sure death on either side of them.
BAM! BAM! BAM!
Savage punches send Strack reeling--BAM!--he falls onto
the girder... nearby are a bunch of tools... Strack
crawls toward them.

451 CONTI1rn D 451
A RIVET GUN
only a few inches from his grasp.
DARIOM
swoops onto Strack, pummelling him.
STRACR'S HAND
inching painfully toward the rivet gun.
DARKMAN
pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He
steps back to give a final blow...
.and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance.
STRACK
lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar.
ZMMMMMM! Z !
452
452 The rivet gun shoots a bolt through Darkman's wrist,
then the other wrist--pinning him to the I-beam...
Strack takes a step backward, exhausted.
453
453 STRACK
STRACK
Now you get to watch your girl-friend
die.
He moves toward a terrified Julie.
DARXMAN
SHRIEKS and reality melts around him as he tastes the
hot soup of rage.
454 CRACK!
Gigantic fissures appear on all the girders... we spin
into Darkman's eyeball to find--
455 THE ULTIMATE RAGE MONTAGE 455
Nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the
camera; Julie and Strack kissing, naked.
456 Strack's face bobs, attached now to the body of the 456
dunking bird, his nose nearing the ignition of a huge
lighter. As contact is made the lighter explodes in a
shower of gold Krugerands.
457 The gold coins fall away to reveal Peyton's unscathed 457
head, bobbing on a freakish and deformed doll's body.
Atop a circus platform, he does an angry jig. He wears
a funny little hat.
458 Peyton's face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal- 458
the face of the Darkman.
459 A drop of liquid Peyton falls upon... A cube of ice. It 459
bursts into flames.
460 The camera races back from Darkman's eye.. his vein 460
pulsing madly.
461 DARXMAN'S RIVETED HAND 461
insensitive to pain, he pulls, every sinew concentrated
on the task. GGGGGGGG ! A horrible grating
sounds as the first rivet rips through steel... One hand
is freed. GGGGGGG ! .The other is freed.
462 STRACK 462
with his back to him, doesn't have a chance to turn as:

462 CONTINUED
DARKMAN
pounces.
He lifts him full into the air. Strack's legs and arms
flail impotently.
DARKMAN
ARRRRRRRGGGGGGG !
Darkman hurls him up, up into the air.
463 Strack rises helpless, flailing his limbs... then begins 463
to fall, yards away from the girder.
464 He spins, end over end, to--PPHHHHFFFTHHMP!--be impaled 464
on the rebars many floors below, next to Durant's face.
CUT TO:
HUMMING at the cut. Darkman and Julie are inside.
Darkman remains turned from Julie, facing the shadows.
Gently, Julie touches his shoulder to draw him toward
her.
JULIE
Peyton, I can help.
DARKMAN
No one can help.
JULIE
I don't care how you look, Peyton! I.
love you. The burns don't matter.
There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted
remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in
close-up.
CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level.

465 CONTINUED
DARKMAN
Take my hand.
Julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers. She
overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his.
DARKMAN
It disgusts you.
JULIE
No.
Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn.
FINALLY:
DARKMAN
This hand... it used to caress you.
Now it can only tear, rip away at
things.
JULIE
(ANXIOUS;
PERSUASIVE)
But you'll perfect the skin. You'll
get rid of the scars.
DARKMAN
It's not just the scars. I've changed-
He grips his skull.
DARKMAN
--inside.
He pulls the elevator open.
DARKMAN
(BEAT)
I can live with it now, but I don't
think anyone else can.
JULIE
(tears in her
EYES)
I want it back. The two of us--the way
it was...
Darkman's voice breaks:

465 CONTINUED(2)
DARKMAN
What we had--our life together--it
belonged in the light of day.
He disappears into the darkness.
JULIE
Peyton!
Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away:
DARKMAN
Peyton is gone...
466 He heads into the shadows. At the edge of the darkness 466
he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a
construction trailer. A pedestrian reappears on the other
side.
Julie knows it's!Darkman. She chases after him but he
slips into the pedestrian traffic.
The camera hurries down the street with Julie as she
desperately searches for him, turning people around,
staring at their faces... It begins to snow.
JULIE
Peyton!
She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into
alien faces in search of the man she loves.
AS WE ROLL END CREDITS
The camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians,
any one of who could be Darkman... We continue to pull
back, down avenues and side-streets, byways, courtyards,
wherever the crowd spills, into an alley... As a street-
person shuffles into view:
467 A MUSCULAR HAND 467
snaps open a switch-blade. A second set of arms grabs
the street person and spins him around, revealing--
