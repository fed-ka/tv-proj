      Eddie breezes in with guitar case.  Hands Brahm (unbruised and 
      cooing) to his wife INGRID (31).  She s gorgeous, funny, cool, 
      making dinner, folding laundry and on the phone.  JANIE (3), 
      helps unfold the laundry. 

                                  INGRID
                    I m on with the Bouncy people.  Do we 
                    want the large or extra large Princess 
                    Bouncy Castle?  I m thinking extra large.  

                                  EDDIE
                    You read my mind.

      He mouths  I m off to my show.   They somehow squeeze a kiss 
      between the phone and Brahm.  He kisses Janie and heads out.


      Eddie s new Honda Odyssey pulls up.  Sticker still in the window.  
      Marshall Amps in back.  Looks up at a 2nd story window, blinds 
      still drawn.  Eddie shakes his head and HONKS.  


      BARRY (31 and doughy) bursts out the doors like school s out.  
      Drumsticks in hand, he peels off his GUITAR CENTER VEST, spikes 
      it down.  Realizes he has a shift tomorrow and picks it back up.


      Derek #4 snaps a photo with the Band when HEADLIGHTS sweep 
      across.  A TOUR BUS pulls in.  The side reads:  DEF REPPLICA - 
      The #1 Def Leppard Tribute Wedding Band! 

      CUE: Opening bars of POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME (Cover Band Version)

      SLO-MO as DEF REPPLICA steps off, HOT BRIDESMAIDS in tow.  The 
      WEDDING BANDS size each other up.  Our guys in KILTS and Repplica 
      clad in sleeveless British flag shirts.  Singer  FAUX JOE  ELLIOTT 
      heckles Eddie s minivan with the FAMILY DECALS on the back window.

                                  FAUX JOE
                    Brilliant tour bus, mates. 
                          (re: Ingrid family sticker)
                    Love the band decals.  Especially 
                    the one of Barry in a skirt.

      Faux hi-fives his  ONE-ARMED  DRUMMER. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Drop the Cockney accent, Phil.  We 
                    went to high school together.

      It s clear the Bridesmaids bought the British act up til now. 

                                  ONE-ARMED DRUMMER
                    Look who s winning Battle of the 
                    Bands now.  We just came from the 
                    Ichiro Wedding at the Space Needle.  
                    In front of half a thousand.  

                                  DEREK #4
                    Yeah?  These guys just killed at 
                    the Holiday Inn!

      Repplica even laughs in a Cockney accent.  Our guys are not 
      amused.  They felt pretty good about themselves until now.

                                  FAUX JOE
                    Keep practicing.  Maybe one day you ll 
                    get signed by Rutherford Events too.

                                  EDDIE
                          (to Tommy)
                    Unreal.  How d these tools hit the 
                      Rutherford jackpot?  

                                  ONE-ARMED DRUMMER
                    Don t fret, wankers.  If you need extra 
                    quid, we could use a few roadies.                                                                                    11.


                                  STEVIE
                    I haven t seen an asshole that big 
                    since Tommy TuTone.

                                  BARRY
                    What were you doing staring at Tommy 
                    TuTone s asshole?

                                  TOMMY
                    Stevie s right.  We can t let these 
                      mock-stars talk to us like this.

                                  EDDIE
                    They re not worth it.  First time 
                      Rutherford hears about us, I don t want 
                    it to be cuz we kicked one of their 
                    bands  asses.  Just walk away.   

                                  FAUX JOE
                    Oy, Eddie.  Bet your wife lays awake 
                      fantasizing what it s like to be with a 
                    real lead guitarist?  If she s lonely, 
                    I ll let her pour some sugar on this!

      That stops Eddie in his tracks.  He looks to Tommy.

                                  TOMMY
                    G nter? 

                                  EDDIE
                          (picking up on it)
                    Glieben.

                                  TOMMY
                    Glauchen.
                          (punches Faux in the face)
                    And Globen.

      It s band member vs. band member.  Stevie pulls the bassist s 
      hair, gets a handful of HAIR EXTENSIONS.  Barry charges the  one-
      armed drummer  who can t get his  missing arm  untied fast enough.

      MUG-SHOT MONTAGE:

      1) TOMMY is unscathed; 2) BARRY somehow lost a fight to the one-
      armed drummer; 3) STEVIE now uses his bandana as a forehead 
      bandage; 4) EDDIE has fat lip and black eye.  BLEND CUT TO:


      Eddie empties his GUITAR PICKS from his kilt pocket into his 
      pick-bowl.  He sees a financial aid REJECTION LETTER from GREEN 
      DOLPHINS PRESCHOOL.  Reads it as Ingrid enters with ASPIRIN.  

                                  INGRID
                    We only have baby aspirin, so take 12.

                                  EDDIE
                    We got rejected for financial aid 
                    from a preschool?

                                  INGRID
                    I know.  It came yesterday.

                                  EDDIE
                    Why didn t you mention it?

                                  INGRID
                    I knew you had a show today and 
                    didn t wanna spoil your fun.

      Ingrid points to the Pottery Barn CAROUSEL FRAME.  Photos of 
      INGRID & EDDIE at the wedding where they met (Eddie has long 
      hair & tats) and their own wedding (short hair, no tats).                                                                                      13.


                                  INGRID
                    Look, I love that you still have your 
                    band.  The part I don t enjoy so much 
                    anymore?  When you guys forget you re 
                    adults with credit scores and revert 
                    to acting like teenagers.  

                                  EDDIE
                    If this is about me  cellphone donging  
                    you, that was a totally innocent mistake.

                                  INGRID
                    Exactly what part of IM-ing a photo of 
                    your privates do you find  innocent? 

                                  EDDIE
                          (regrettably)
                    The part where I accidentally CC d 
                    the moms in Janie s Playgroup.

                                  INGRID
                    Do you think Todd runs off with the 
                    guys every weekend?  Or TUI s his 
                    wife?  He s CEO of a stem cell company 
                    but finds a way to give Heather a 
                    break on weekends.  He sends her off 
                    to a massage while he takes over kid 
                    duty.  Taxis them to playdates.  He 
                    even tucks them in at night.

                                  EDDIE
                    He also tucks in his sweaters.  
                    Todd s a tucker.

      She laughs.  That she can t argue.  They re on the same page. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I get it, honey.  I ve been out having 
                    fun while you spent the last 5 weekends 
                    alone with the kids.  I can only 
                    imagine what that does to a person.  

                                  INGRID
                    Tell me about it.  I have nightmares 
                    where I m being chased by mac & 
                    cheese.  I can t even remember the 
                    last movie I watched that didn t star 
                    talking animals.  Talking cars.  Or 
                    Brendan Fraser...I m a mom on the 
                    edge, man!  I need a break!

      Eddie does his best Power Point pitch for Ingrid.                                                                                      14.


                                  EDDIE
                    How s this sound?  Next Saturday, all 
                    yours.  Do whatever you want.  Go nuts. 
                    I ll even steal a page from Todd s 
                    playbook and plan you a Spa Night.

                                  INGRID
                    Aren t you forgetting one tiny thing?  

                                  EDDIE
                    Yes.  I promise no more shenanigans 
                    and getting out of control.

                                  INGRID
                    Good.  But I meant Janie s Birthday 
                    party is next Saturday.

                                  EDDIE
                    Right, okay.  Then we push Spa 
                    Night one Saturday.  I ll make sure 
                    Tommy doesn t book anything. 

                                  INGRID
                    Can I count on this?  Cuz I m 
                    starting to get excited.  

      Eddie grabs their WEDDING ALBUM.  Raises his hand to take an oath. 

                                  EDDIE
                    I swear on our wedding album.  I 
                    won t even pick up my guitar.

      As they hug, he eyes drift to the Carousel.  A photo of him and 
      TOMMY on stage.  Two weeks off from the band might be a long 
      time.  He spins the Carousel to a photo of him and Ingrid.  



                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    15.


                                            ACT TWO



      EDDIE wears a camera, video camera and Brahm in a Baby Bjorn.  He 
      tries to seem engaged talking to TODD (32) - the perfect dad with 
      a tucked in Green Dolphins Preschool sweater - and OLIVER (32) - 
      that dad who always dresses in party theme.  Today he s a farmer.   

                                  TODD
                    Just opened the Class Roster email.  
                    How cool is it our girls are in the 
                    same class together at Green Dolphins? 

      Todd and Oliver bump fists.  Then turn to bump with Eddie.

                                  EDDIE
                    Actually, we re thinking of sending 
                    Janie to Montessori.  Have you seen 
                    their playground?  They ve got a turbo 
                    tube slide.   

                                  OLIVER
                      Montessori s just a  safety  preschool. 

                                  TODD
                    Yeah, Eddie.  Send Janie there, you can 
                    wave bye-bye to a good K thru 6.  

                                  EDDIE
                    But for $15,000 a year?  They can at 
                    least know what color a dolphin is.

      TOMMY shows up like a bachelornaut who landed on Planet Toddler.  
      He has an newspaper wrapped gift and 6-PACK.  He nods to Stevie, 
      who s having a blast at the FACE-PAINTING TABLE.  Kids lined up 
      as he paints the DURAN DURAN logo on Janie s cheek.

                                  TOMMY
                    Who are these people?  Did they throw 
                     em in when you rented the tables?

                                  EDDIE
                    Just some co-workers, neighbors, 
                    Janie s ballet clique...

                                  TOMMY
                    Who s the tucker?

                                  EDDIE
                    That s Todd.  He cooks, cleans, 
                    coaches soccer...Basically every 
                    dad s worst nightmare. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Beer?                                                                                    20.


                                  EDDIE
                    Probably shouldn t.  It s a kids party.

      Tommy cracks a beer, puts the others in the cooler with the 
      JUICE BOXES.  Ingrid swoops in and grabs the beer.

                                  TOMMY
                    Hey Ingrid.  I got Janie a gift.  Hope 
                    it s okay.  It s for ages 4 and up. 

      Ingrid studies Tommy s newspaper wrapping job.  It s PERSONALS 
      with 900 numbers and provocative photos.   

                                  INGRID
                    But your wrapping paper s for 18 and up.  
                          (kisses him on cheek)
                    Good to see you, Tommy. 

      As she walks off, Eddie shakes his head at Tommy s faux pas.  

                                  TOMMY
                    I need to talk to you guys in the 
                    studio.  Where s Barry?  

      ON BACKYARD DECK - Barry reads GOODNIGHT MOON in bedtime voice 
      to TODDLERS.  In Barry fashion, he makes the story his own. 

                                  BARRY
                    In the Great Green Room, there was a 
                      telephone, and a red balloon...Some 
                    booze, two sticks, a trashed drum- 
                    kit...And a drummer, face-down in his 
                    own vomit.  Goodnight Keith Moon...

      As concerned moms pull their kids away, Eddie jumps in.

                                  EDDIE
                    O-kay!  That does it for Storytime 
                    with Uncle Barry!


      As our guys exit, Eddie and Stevie double-fisting lattes.  Eddie 
      can t contain his excitement any longer.  

                                  EDDIE
                    Did you see how cush their offices 
                    were??  I could get used to having 
                    band meetings here.  Seeing Sara so 
                    happy is just icing on the cake. 

                                  TOMMY
                    What, she was happy with me.

                                  EDDIE
                    Take it from someone who s married.  
                    There s a whole other level of happy.

                                  TOMMY
                    You don t think I m capable of 
                    giving a girl this platinum card 
                    level of happiness?

                                  EDDIE
                      Permission to be brutally honest?

                                  TOMMY
                      Permission granted.

                                  EDDIE
                    You re like the guy in the romantic 
                    comedy the girl thinks she wants.  But 
                    the audience knows there s no future.

                                  TOMMY
                    Wow.  My best friend just called me 
                     The Dick  in the rom-com.

                                  BARRY
                    Well I root for that guy.  Bigger the 
                    dick, better the frontman.  Liam 
                      Gallagher?  Dick.  Billy Corgan?  
                    Shaved head, big hairy ego.  Jack 
                    Johnson?  No dick.  Dude s a di-yatch.

      Tommy s not glad to be in that company for the first time.  

                                  EDDIE
                    I m just saying, women wanna know 
                    there s a plan.  You re great at 
                    planning tonight.  But they wanna know 
                    what the plan is 25 years from now.                                                                                     29.


                                  TOMMY
                    You know too much about rom-coms. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Ingrid hijacked our Netflix Cue.  I can 
                    give a dissertation on Katherine Heigl.  

                                  BARRY
                    Before you do, can we figure out what 
                    we re doing for a rehearsal space?

                                  STEVIE
                    We ll use my studio.

      Barry stops to bend over laughing.  Leans against The Lenin 
      Statue to prop himself up.  

                                  BARRY
                    What I wouldn t give to be that naive 
                      again...Since you haven t officially 
                    been in a band, allow me to explain 
                    how  band politics  work.  It s a 
                      totalitarian system.  All major 
                    decisions go through the drummer --  

                                  EDDIE
                    Clearly my brother doesn t know how 
                    they work either.  When can we see it? 


      Before Barry rings the doorbell - he turns to Tommy and Eddie. 

                                  BARRY
                    Just so we re clear.  The code word 
                    in case we wanna bail is cowbell.  

      He rings the doorbell.  A COWBELL chimes.

                                  BARRY
                    COWBELL.


      Tommy, Stevie and Barry wait.  Barry s got his drums plus 2 
      nitrous tanks and a butt-load of tubing.

                                  STEVIE
                    U2 didn t lug this much gear on tour, 
                    and they had a Giant Cyber Claw.

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah, Barry.  What s with the nitrous?

                                  BARRY
                    I wanna give Rutherford something to 
                    remember us by.

                                  STEVIE
                    Don t do anything that ll blow my chances 
                    with that lobby latt  machine. 

      Eddie s MINIVAN pulls up.  Tommy hops in to see Janie, Brahm 
      (in Gabba shirts) and ZOE (Kat Dennings type) wearing an iPod.

                                  TOMMY
                    Tell me they re not singing back-up.

                                  EDDIE
                    Don t start.  Zoe made me pay triple 
                    her rate.  She knew I couldn t wear a 
                    Baby Bjorn on stage.

                                  TOMMY
                    For a guy who tells his wife everything, 
                    you really can t tell her anything.


      It s clear why this was voted Voted  Best Sunset Wedding Locale

                                  EDDIE
                    How beautiful is that mountain?

                                  TOMMY
                    Speaking of mountains...

      ANGLE ON FAKE BREASTS in low-cut dresses.  Matthew and his dad 
      DR. MILLER greet GUESTS.  The wives congratulate Matthew.  The 
      grateful husbands congratulate Dr. Miller for a job well done.

                                  TOMMY
                    Looks like Dr. Miller s entire 
                    client list is here.


      The band sets up.  Eddie hands Zoe a YO GABBA CONCERT DVD.  

                                  EDDIE
                    I paid top dollar for this bootleg.  
                    So make sure the kids study it.  
                    Ingrid asks very detailed questions.  

      As Stevie pours water in his FOG MACHINE he sees Barry s FISH.

                                  STEVIE
                    What s with the goldfish?

                                  BARRY
                          (laughs; to Gardener)
                    Hear that?  He thinks these are goldfish!

      The GARDENER just keeps on blowing with his blower.                                                                                      38.


                                  BARRY
                    These are Shubunkin.  They re like 
                    the caviar of --

                                  STEVIE
                    What?  Goldfish?

      Tommy grabs the GIFT BOX and heads off stage directly into 
      BETHENNY.  CUE: SPOOKY MUSIC STING.

                                  TOMMY
                    Geez, Bethenny...Someone left this at 
                    Valet.  I was gonna run it up to Sara.

                                  BETHENNY
                    You re not getting anywhere near her.  
                    Consider yourself under stage arrest.

      She holds up a SCRAM ANKLE BRACELET.  Tommy laughs. 

                                  TOMMY
                    You re kidding, right?

                                  BETHENNY
                    There s no chance you re ruining tonight.  

      She fastens the ankle bracelet, takes the gift, and walks off.  

                                  TOMMY
                    I d put the odds at 50-50...


      Rachel quick steps, smiling so hard she may pull a muscle.  The 
      smile completely falls when she reaches Tommy at the stage. 

                                  RACHEL
                    She wants to see you.

                                  TOMMY
                    Which Bridesmaid?  Third from the altar? 

      Rachel sneers.  As Tommy follows, Eddie gets suspicious.

                                  EDDIE
                    Hey Tommy, help me grab the Bugera 
                    Amp out of the mini-van. 

                                  TOMMY
                    You didn t bring the Bugera.  You 
                    brought the Marshall.

                                  EDDIE
                    Then go with me to grab the Marshall.

      Tommy s a blank.  Rachel rolls her eyes. 

                                  RACHEL
                    Even I get it.  The Marshall is 
                    Sara.  And Eddie wants to talk you 
                    out of ruining the amp s wedding.

      As she heads off to the bridal suite, Eddie rips into Tommy.

                                  EDDIE
                    You effin  lied.  Admit it.

                                  TOMMY
                    Telling Ingrid you re taking the kids 
                    to a Toddler Rock show?  That s a lie. 

                                  EDDIE
                    You selfish D-bag!  When are you gonna 
                    grow up and realize your actions have 
                      consequences for everyone else, you 
                    effin  eff! 

                                  TOMMY
                    If you re gonna chew me out, at least 
                    cuss at me like I m not some 4-year old.                                                                                    40.


                                  EDDIE
                    Sorry.  It s the Daddy V-chip.

                                  TOMMY
                    So you think all this is me being selfish?

                                  EDDIE
                    I think it s a cock-jerk reaction to 
                    her picking another guy.

                                  TOMMY
                       Cock-jerk.   That s better.  Now we 
                    can argue like men.

                                  EDDIE
                    If you go in there, you gotta give 
                    Sara a real commitment.  Are you 
                    ready to be that family in the Disney 
                    Cruise ad?  Cast off on that 10-day 
                    trip from Port Canaveral.  Journey 
                    south through the turquoise Caribbean 
                    waters?  Where you ll snorkle with 
                    all your favorite Disney characters?? 

                                  TOMMY
                    It sounds like you booked that trip.

                                  EDDIE
                    I felt bad for lying about this gig.  
                    We set sail in 2 weeks.

                                  TOMMY
                    Then tell me if this is selfish.  The 
                    reason I broke up with Sara was for you.  
                    And Barry.  Mostly you.  I didn t think 
                    I could handle both.  So I gave up a 
                    future with her to pursue our dream.

                                  EDDIE
                    How come you didn t tell me?

                                  TOMMY
                    Because I knew you d feel guilty.

                                  EDDIE
                          (nods; Tommy s right)
                    Thanks for considering my feelings.  
                    But don t do this.  Think about 
                    what s at stake here.

                                  TOMMY
                    Our shot with Rutherford?                                                                                    41.


                                  EDDIE
                    Bigger.  Sara s happiness.  Do the 
                    right thing, Tommy.  Let her go.

      Deadlock stare.  Beat.  Then Tommy walks to the Bridal Suite.  
      He stops, remembering the ANKLE BRACELET. 


      Guests get restless.  Especially Bethenny.  Checks the time but 
      notices her SCRAM TRACKER FLASHING.  Spins to look at THE STAGE.  
      No Tommy.  Eddie watches her stomp off with the Scram Tracker. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Shit!  Stall as long as you can.

      Eddie bolts, guitar still on HIS NECK.  Barry and Stevie share 
      a glance then play the longest song ever: IN A GADA-DA-VIDA.


      Guitar strapped on his back, Eddie climbs the trellis to the 
      2ND FLOOR to warn Tommy about Bethenny.  He looks in to see 
      Tommy s hand on Sara s naked breast. 

                                  EDDIE
                          (bangs on window)
                    Tommy!  That better not be you in there!                                                                                    45.


      The trellis gives out.  Eddie falls into the roses below.


      Rachel comes out to a sea of impatient guests who are now 11 
      minutes into IN A GADA-DA-VIDA.  She whispers to DR. MILLER.

                                  RACHEL
                    Laugh so Matthew doesn t worry. 
                          (he fake-laughs)
                    Now follow me...


      The guests applaud Matthew and Sara as they kiss.

                                  TOMMY (V.O.)
                          (pre-lap)
                    Put down your Tuna Tar-Tar...
