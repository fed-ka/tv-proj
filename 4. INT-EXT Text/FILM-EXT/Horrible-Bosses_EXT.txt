A soulless four-story building in a drab office park.
Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance.
A car pulls up outside the modest building.
Stacy drives off. Dale steels himself for what lies
ahead, then goes inside.
A medium-sized warehouse building in an industrial
neighborhood.
Kurt walks Jack to his Cadillac.
JACK
Tell me something, Kurt. Are you
happy here?
KURT
You kidding? It's the best job in
the world.

25 CONTINUED: 25
JACK
I'm glad to hear you say that.
I'm rewriting my will tonight and
there's going to be a special
place for you in there.
He gives Kurt a hug like a doting father, then climbs
into his car. As Jack pulls out and begins driving
across the parking lot, Kurt waves. Suddenly, the car's
HORN begins to honk in a CONSTANT BLARE. Kurt lowers his
hand as the car veers off the pavement, slowly cruising
into a tree where it stops abruptly, the horn still
honking.
A bewildered Kurt runs toward the car, as we --
CUT TO:
Nick sits alongside five other CO-WORKERS at a conference
table. Harken's chair at the head is empty. Nick pours
himself some water from a glass pitcher on the table.
NICK
He did say ten o'clock, right?
(CONTINUED)
20.
27 CONTINUED: 27
CO-WORKER
Yeah. Do you know what this is
about?
NICK
It just said `staff meeting' on
the memo.
(WHISPERING)
Funny how he gets all over me if
I'm a minute late, but he makes us
wait fifteen.
HARKEN (O.S.)
You were two minutes late, Nick.
Nick jumps as Harken enters.
HARKEN
And I didn't know I had to punch a
clock with you.
NICK
You don't. Of course you don't.
I'm sorry --
HARKEN
I'm going to attribute this to
your drinking problem.
NICK
I don't have a --
HARKEN
(with a smile to the
OTHERS)
Let's get started. Shall we?
Nick's eyes narrow. Suddenly, he grabs the heavy glass
pitcher from the table and SHATTERS IT AGAINST HARKEN'S
FACE. Shards of glass fly everywhere as Harken falls
from his chair onto the floor.
SMASH CUT TO:
28 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 28
Harken is fine. Nick is as we left him.
HARKEN
Okay, have we figured out our best
sales distribution plan for the
new model year handsets?
(CONTINUED)
21.
28 CONTINUED: 28
Nick's CO-WORKERS bury their heads in their notes. Nick
tensely raises his hand.
HARKEN
Yes?
NICK
I simulated a number of sales
cycles, factoring in likely end-
users, point-of-sale limitations
and specific demographic
variables.
HARKEN
And?
NICK
And in my opinion, an open plan
selling process in our top 30
markets along with targeted
upgrade offers to existing
customers promises the greatest
yield.
Harken nods. Is he impressed?
HARKEN
Thank you, Nick. Did everyone see
how he did that? Yes, he may be a
pathological liar and have a
crippling drinking problem, but
when the chips are down, Nick has
what it takes.
Nick glows.
HARKEN
Which brings us to our next order
of business. I've decided who I
want as our new Senior VP of
Sales. He's sitting right here
among you.
Everyone turns to look at Nick.
HARKEN
It's me.
Everyone's head snaps back to Harken.
NICK
What?
(CONTINUED)
22.
28 CONTINUED: (2) 28
HARKEN
I've decided to absorb the
responsibilities of the Senior VP
position into my own. I realized
if you want something done right,
you do it yourself. So, I'm going
to be knocking down the wall
between my office and what
would've been the Senior VP's to
create a single, enormous office.
However, as a cost-cutting
measure, I will only be taking 85%
of the additional salary I'm
entitled to. It's called self-
sacrifice, people. Learn from
this.
Harken heads out.
The three guys are walking home, all mildly buzzed.
KURT
So I guess we're just gonna be
miserable for the rest of our
lives.
DALE
What do you mean?
KURT
What options do we have? We can
quit our jobs and turn into Kenny.
Or keep our jobs and turn into
sad, ball-less losers who spend
their days dreaming of ways to
kill their bosses.
There's a beat as Nick regards Kurt.
NICK
You do that too?
KURT
Of course. Everyone does. It's
the only thing that keeps us from
going totally bat-shit.
NICK
The other day I imagined shoving
one of those jugs from the water
cooler in Harken's mouth and
making him drink until his bladder
explodes.
DALE
Jeez.
KURT
That's so funny. I had the same
idea for Pellit.

KURT (CONT'D)
Only using gasoline instead of
water. And his ass instead of his
mouth.
DALE
You guys are sick.
KURT
What's sick about it? It's just a
way to let off steam.
NICK
Yeah, Dale. It's not like we're
actually going to kill our bosses.
They continue walking. After a beat.
KURT
You have to admit though, our
lives would be a lot better if our
bosses were dead.
NICK
Well, of course. It's the one
thing that keeps me from being
happy.
DALE
Me too.
There's another beat.
KURT
Let's just consider this, for one
second.
DALE
Consider what?
KURT
Killing our bosses. I'm just
being hypothetical here.
DALE
(laughing it off)
Yeah, right.
NICK
Very funny.
KURT
Well, it's not like they're gonna
live forever. These pieces of
shit are going to die someday.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
35.
37 CONTINUED: (2) 37
KURT (CONT'D)
We'd just be accelerating that
natural process.
NICK
Shut up, Kurt.
DALE
Yeah, shut up, Kurt.
KURT
(EARNEST)
Frankly, I don't see any reason
not to do it.
DALE
Well, first of all, killing
someone is illegal and immoral --
KURT
It may be illegal but I'm not sure
it's immoral. Sometimes one evil
person has to die for the greater
good of the community. If Bobby
Pellit has his way, hundreds,
maybe thousands of innocent
Bolivians will suffer. It would
actually be immoral not to kill
him.
Nick begins to warm to the idea.
NICK
I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam
Gam because of Harken.
KURT
Exactly! Who knows how many other
Gam Gams have died alone.
DALE
I can't believe you guys are
actually talking about this. I
don't care how bad our bosses are.
We're not murderers.
NICK
No, we're not, Dale. We're just
trying to live our lives. But
what are we supposed to do when
someone makes it impossible for us
to live our lives? Do we just
bend over and take it up the ass
forever?
(CONTINUED)
36.
37 CONTINUED: (3) 37
KURT
No, we do not!
DALE
What you guys are talking about is
wrong and you know it.
NICK
Julia's ruining your life. That's
wrong.
KURT
Yeah!
DALE
She's not ruining my life. If
anything's ruining my life it's
you guys and your drunk bullshit.
KURT
If it's bullshit, Dale, then how
come we all want to do it so much?
They reach the corner where they part ways.
DALE
I don't want to do it. And when
you sober up neither will you.
We're not killing anyone.
Dale heads off.
KURT
(TO NICK)
I was just being hypothetical.
NICK
(QUICKLY)
Yeah, me too.
OFF their ambivalent looks --
Dale is organizing some equipment when a pair of woman's
hands suddenly cover his eyes.
WOMAN (O.S.)
(SUGGESTIVELY)
Guess who?

38 CONTINUED: 38
DALE
(WEARILY)
I'm really not in the mood for
this now --
He turns and reacts as he sees it's not Julia, but his
fiance, Stacy.
DALE
Stacy?!
STACY
Not in the mood for what?
DALE
For... nothing. What are you
doing here?
Julia appears in her office doorway.
JULIA
I invited her.
STACY
She called and said now that we're
engaged, she wanted to offer me
free dental work. And you know
I've had that loose filling for a
while. It's so sweet of you,
Julia.
JULIA
It's my pleasure. You're part of
the family now.
DALE
(VISIBLY UPTIGHT)
Uhhhh... I don't know if this is a
good idea.
STACY
Why not?
DALE
We don't want to take advantage of
Julia.
JULIA
Dale, there's nothing you could do
that would be taking advantage of
me. Nothing.
(then, to Stacy)
Now what do you say we pump you
full of gas?
(CONTINUED)

38 CONTINUED: (2) 38
Julia leads Stacy into the exam room. Dale cuts them
off.
DALE
Wait -- no gas. She doesn't need
to be out.
STACY
What are you talking about, Dale?
You know I'm not good with drills.
JULIA
(POINTEDLY)
You don't want your fiance to
suffer, do you?
OFF Dale's defeated look --
CUT TO:
Kurt opens the door on Nick and Dale. The decor of
Kurt's place is best described as a middle-income
bachelor pad.
KURT
Come in. The guy should be here
pretty soon.
NICK
Wait. You actually found
someone?!
KURT
It was as easy as buying a used
futon.
(CONTINUED)
44.
43 CONTINUED: 43
He points to his computer. On the screen is a listing
FROM --
DALE
Craigslist?! You found a hitman
on Craigslist.
KURT
Yup. But they don't post it as
`hitman.' That would be stupid.
They use code words, like
`liquidation,' `pest control,'
`wet work.' Check it out. This
is our guy.
Nick reads the listing.
NICK
`Skilled professional with years
of experience in domestic and
international wet work. Fast and
discreet. No children or
political figures.'
KURT
See? He's principled.
DALE
This is so dangerous. What if
he's a narc?
NICK
Yeah, Kurt. Call him back and
cancel.
KURT
It's too late. He's on his way.
DALE
What do we do if this guy gets
here and he asks for so much money
that we can't afford him and he
gets mad and kills all of us?
KURT
I don't think he'd stay in
business long if he killed
everyone who couldn't afford him.
NICK
(looking out window)
Guys! I think this is him!
The others hurry to look. From --
45.
44 THEIR POV 44
We see a black Mercedes SLK pull up. A distinguished-
looking MAN in a well-tailored suit steps out. He wears
sunglasses and carries a briefcase.
45 BACK TO SCENE 45
NICK
Nice car.
KURT
Whoa. This guy's legit.
DALE
I bet that briefcase has one of
those guns you have to screw
together.
NICK
All right, let's just be
professional here. We don't want
to seem all giddy.
A knock at the door.
KURT
(HUSHED)
How's my hair?
NICK
(SOTTO)
It doesn't matter!
Kurt opens the door on the Man who looks even smoother up
close.
MAN
(BRITISH ACCENT)
Is one of you Kurt?
DALE
(whispering to Nick)
Oh my God, he's like James Bond!
KURT
(to the Man)
Yes, hi, I'm Kurt. Please come
in.
MAN
Thank you. Are all three of you
participating in this?
(CONTINUED)
46.
45 CONTINUED: 45
NICK
Yes, we are.
MAN
Very well. Now before we go any
further, I need to know if there
are any hidden recording devices
in this room. I will find out if
there are.
DALE
No, no! We definitely don't want
to record this, sir.
MAN
Then let's get started.
He walks to the middle of the living room, opens his
briefcase and takes out a plastic tarp which he proceeds
to unfurl over the carpet.
KURT
Whoa, whoa. What's that for?
MAN
For the mess.
NICK
We don't want you to kill us!
DALE
(FREAKING OUT)
Oh my God! I knew it!
MAN
Kill you? What are you talking
about?
The guys exchange a confused look.
KURT
Your ad said you do wet work.
MAN
That's correct. I urinate on
other men for money.
NICK/KURT
What?!
MAN
Why do you think my ad was in the
`men seeking men' section?
(CONTINUED)
47.
45 CONTINUED: (2) 45
NICK
(TO KURT)
You were looking in `men seeking
men'?!
KURT
Yeah! We're men seeking a man,
aren't we?
NICK
You are such a moron.
MAN
So you're telling me I drove all
the way to the Valley and no one
wants to be pissed on?
DALE
Please don't kill us.
MAN
I don't kill people!
(then, sighing)
Can I use your rest room? I've
stored up rather a large amount of
pee for this.
KURT
(POINTING)
It's right through there.
The Man heads off. After a beat --
KURT
Good thing I didn't call the guy
who was offering to do `dirty
work.'
Kurt's car drives down a depressed-looking block.
Kurt's car pulls up on a grimy-looking South-Central
street and stops in front of a dingy bar. The guys get
out and look around warily.
KURT
This must be the place.
DALE
Aren't you worried about your car?
KURT
Nah, Gregory's watching it.
NICK
You really think we're gonna find
a hitman in there?
KURT
I think we're gonna have a hard
time deciding between all the
hitmen in there. Trust me, these
are the lowest of the low.
The guys come out onto the sidewalk.
DALE
This is ridiculous. We're never
gonna find someone to do this for
us.
COCKSUCKER JONES (O.S.)
Yo!
They turn to see COCKSUCKER JONES, 30s, the guy who was
sitting next to them at the bar.
COCKSUCKER JONES
I think I can help you boys.
He gestures for them to follow him into the alley beside
the bar. Kurt and Nick move to follow.
DALE
Oh, we're just gonna follow him
into that alley?... All right.
Cocksucker Jones holds an open briefcase that's empty but
for a single stack of taped together 20-dollar bills.
COCKSUCKER JONES
Looks like it's all here.
DALE
Turns out we didn't really need
the briefcase after all. Could've
just used a manila envelope.
KURT
Shut up, Dale.
NICK
So, Cocksucker, how long do you
think it'll be before you've...
taken care of business?
COCKSUCKER JONES
Here's the thing. I just got out
of doing a dime for some pretty
ugly shit and I'm still on
probation. They're watching me.
So if I step out of line, I go
right back inside.
KURT
You told us you could take care of
it.
COCKSUCKER JONES
And I'm gonna. I'm gonna be your
professional advisor. Think of me
as your murder consultant.
NICK
We don't want a murder consultant.
We want a murderer.
DALE
I knew we were getting ripped off!
KURT
Okay, look. This isn't what we
talked about.

KURT (CONT'D)
Can we just get our money back,
please? Then we'll be on our way.
COCKSUCKER JONES
Sorry, no refunds.
NICK
That's five thousand dollars. You
think we're just gonna walk away
and let you keep that?
COCKSUCKER JONES
(getting in his face)
I think you're forgetting who
you're talking to.
Cocksucker pulls back the lower edge of his jacket to
reveal what appears to be the holster of a gun.
DALE
Whoa, whoa! We don't want any
trouble.
COCKSUCKER JONES
Now either I give you the advice
you paid for, or you can walk away
with nothing. Up to you.
KURT
Look, the whole reason we came to
you is because we don't have the
experience to do it ourselves.
COCKSUCKER JONES
Most killers are first-timers.
Look, the key to a good murder is
making it look like an accident.
Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide,
that sort of thing. If you do it
right, you won't even have to be
there when it goes down.
NICK
That makes sense. But how would
we fake three accidents?
COCKSUCKER JONES
You need to stalk your prey, track
their movements, get to know them
inside and out. Where do they go?
What do they eat for breakfast?
Who're they fucking?
(CONTINUED)
59.
54 CONTINUED: (2) 54
DALE
You're talking about surveillance
and recon.
COCKSUCKER JONES
But making it look like an
accident won't be enough if the
pigs can pin a motive on you.
NICK
Well, we all have obvious motives
for killing our bosses.
COCKSUCKER JONES
So why don't you kill each other's
bosses?
DALE
Hey, that's a good idea. Like
Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train.
KURT
The Danny DeVito movie?
DALE
Yes, the famous Alfred
Hitchcock/Danny DeVito movie.
You're thinking of Throw Mama from
the Train. But it's actually the
same idea. If we kill each
other's bosses there's no link to
us.
NICK
That's pretty good.
COCKSUCKER JONES
That's what you're paying me for.
Now ain't that worth five grand?
The guys all AD LIB "no's."
COCKSUCKER JONES
Yeah, well, too fucking bad.
Nick is poring over a stack of documents when his phone
rings.
INTERCUT WITH:
60.
Kurt's car pulls up slowly and parks. Kurt, Dale and
Nick slump down in their seats.
The three guys creep around Pellit's patio, peeking in
doors and windows. Finally:
NICK
I don't see him.
Kurt is about to try a window when Dale stops him.
DALE
What are you doing?
KURT
We're not gonna get intel standing
on his lawn. We have to go in.
DALE
What about fingerprints? We don't
have gloves.
KURT
Here, do this.
Kurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands. Dale
does the same. Nick, who wears a T-shirt, tucks his
hands inside the bottom of the shirt. With some
difficulty, Kurt slides open the window.
KURT
Here we go.
The three of them manage to wriggle through the window.
It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill,
causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt. At last,
all three are inside.
63.
Nick emerges from the store with a plastic bag and gets
into Kurt's car.
A two-story house with a tidy yard. Kurt's car pulls up.
Kurt and Nick sneak up to the front porch which is
camouflaged by shrubs. They peek inside.
NICK
(WHISPERING)
Looks like the coast is clear.
Kurt tries the windows. They're locked.
KURT
Damn. Guess we'll have to break
in the old-fashioned way.
Kurt looks around and spots a small rock beside the
porch. He picks it up and winds back to throw it at the
window.
NICK
Kurt, wait!
But it's too late. Kurt has released the rock. It HITS
the window, but instead of breaking the glass, the rock
itself BREAKS into two pieces.
KURT
Holy shit. I broke the rock.
NICK
No, it's one of those hide-a-key
things. Look...
(CONTINUED)
69.
74 CONTINUED: 74
Nick shows Kurt a key concealed in one half of the fake
rock. He grabs it and inserts it into the front door
lock.
Just then, Harken, in running attire, comes jogging up
the street. His eye is caught by the plastic bag falling
from the car window onto the street. He stops and
angrily picks up the bag.

79 CONTINUED: 79
HARKEN
Hey, schmuck.
Dale, surprised, turns to the window.
DALE
Excuse me?
HARKEN
You want to tell me why you're
littering on my street?
DALE
Oh, I'm sorry, that blew out the
window. I wasn't littering.
HARKEN
I don't care if it blew out of
your twat. Now, get your fucking
Chevy Cavalier the hell off my
block!
DALE
Whoa. Sir, there's no need to be
hostile.
HARKEN
Hostile? You want to see hostile?
How about I go in the house and
get my --
Suddenly, Harken begins to choke and his face grows
increasingly red.
DALE
Get your what?
With one hand Harken grabs his throat and with the other
he looks at the plastic bag he's holding.
HARKEN
(STRAINED)
Peanuts?
DALE
Huh? Oh, yeah. It was a peanut
butter sandwich.
Harken collapses to his knees. His face is turning blue
now. Dale quickly steps out of the car.
DALE
Oh god! What should I do?! Tell
me what to do!
(CONTINUED)
72.
79 CONTINUED: (2) 79
Harken yanks up the right leg of his jogging pants
revealing an EPI-PEN strapped to his ankle. He reaches
for it, but Dale moves faster.
DALE
What do I do with this? Should I
inject you?!
Harken nods urgently as his eyes begin to roll back.
DALE
Okay, hold on! I got this.
Dale takes the cap off the epi-pen, raises his arm and
jams the needle into Harken's chest. Harken lets out a
grunt.
DALE
Did I do it? Did I get enough
in?! I'm gonna do it again!
Dale raises his arm again.
As Dale kneels over Harken to check his breathing, a car
pulls up alongside and MRS. HARKEN steps out. Seeing her
husband on the ground, she rushes over.
MRS. HARKEN
Oh my god! What happened?!
DALE
He had an allergic reaction. But
I think he's coming around. Do
you know him?
MRS. HARKEN
He's my husband.
Mrs. Harken kneels beside Harken and supports his head.
MRS. HARKEN
Honey? Can you hear me?
Harken groggily looks down at his torso which is
perforated by dozens of tiny needle marks.
HARKEN
(groggy, to Dale)
Wha-- What did you do to me?
DALE
I injected you with your thing.

Thank you so much!
She grabs Dale in a warm hug.
DALE
Oh, it was nothing.
HARKEN

What's this? What's with the
hugging?
MRS. HARKEN
I'm just thankful that he was
here.
HARKEN
I'll bet you are. Do you know
this guy?
MRS. HARKEN
No. We just --
HARKEN
Are you fucking him, Rhonda?
MRS. HARKEN
Oh, come on.
HARKEN
(TO DALE)
What were you doing out here,
anyway? Waiting to fuck my wife?
DALE
(FLUSTERED)
I've never met your wife --
Still a bit woozy, Harken gets to his feet and points at
Dale.
HARKEN
You need to get the hell out of
here.
MRS. HARKEN
Dave, stop it. You should be
thanking him. Why are you being
so suspicious?
(CONTINUED)
75.
81 CONTINUED: (2) 81
HARKEN
Why? Because I know you sleep
around on me. And I'm going to
find out who it is.
MRS. HARKEN
You're being ridiculous.
HARKEN
Am I? What about Maurilio? I see
the way you look at him.
MRS. HARKEN
I am not having sex with the
gardener!
As Harken and his wife continue to bicker, Dale quietly
retreats to Kurt's car.
Nick sits in his parked car watching the house through
binoculars.
Kurt sits in his car, reading Maxim magazine. Julia's
car pulls up. She gets out, goes to the trunk, opens it,
then bends down to get a bag of groceries. Nick watches
her ass appreciatively as she does and keeps watching as
she heads into her building.
SFX: His cell phone rings.
NICK
(ON PHONE)
Hey. Have you learned anything
about Julia yet?
KURT
Well, I've learned that Dale is a
homosexual because this chick is
unbelievably hot. How's it going
over there?
NICK
I'm just waiting for Pellit to go
to sleep. I wonder how Dale's
doing with Harken.
79.
Dale's car is parked.
Looking irritated, Pellit answers the door. Before he
can get a word out...
... Harken removes a gun from his pocket and SHOOTS
Pellit twice in the chest.
Harken looks around. Did he hear something? No. He
calmly but briskly walks away from Nick's car, gets into
his own and speeds off.
Nick's car SPEEDS through a red light at an intersection.
A TRAFFIC CAMERA FLASHES as it snaps Nick's photo and
license plate.
Kurt's car is parked across the street.
KURT (V.O.)
At first I was surveilling her
just like I was supposed to...
85.
DALE (V.O.)
So you took that as an invitation
to fuck her?
Julia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and
beckons him inside with one finger. She walks back
inside, leaving the door wide open.
KURT (V.O.)
No. I took her invitation to fuck
her as an invitation to fuck her.
(CONTINUED)
86.
103 CONTINUED: 103
Kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out
headfirst, planting his face on the street. He jumps up,
but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt. He finally
extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he
can.
Nick, Kurt and Dale emerge from the bar.
NICK
Come on, we'll take my car.
The three of them climb into Nick's car.
87.
Hagan and Samson pull up in their car and get out.
Kurt's car pulls up with the lights off and parks.
The guys tiptoe onto the porch, peeking in the windows.
Nick tries the front door... and it swings open. They
look at each other, then quietly head inside.
A short distance behind a car is following Kurt's. As it
comes closer we see it's a Porsche. And it's driven by a
determined-looking Harken.
Kurt's car turns the corner and stops short.
Kurt quickly does a U-turn and ZOOMS off in the direction
they came, inadvertently SPEEDING through a red light.
We see a traffic camera FLASH.
131 INSERT - A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH 131
clearly showing the three guys, their faces distorted
with panic.
107.
Harken's car PLOWS into the rear of Kurt's, forcing it
into the back of a parked car. Even if the engine was
working, there'd be nowhere to go now.
Dazed from the impact, the guys look back to see Harken
slowly approaching on foot, holding a gun in his hand.

Shit, shit, shit...
Harken taps on Kurt's window with the barrel of the gun.
Kurt lowers the window.

HARKEN
Out of the car. All of you.
The three guys nervously exit the car and face Harken who
points the gun at them.
NICK
Look, Mr. Harken --
HARKEN
Shut the fuck up! I've got six
bullets in here. So if I want to,
I can shoot each of you twice,
just like I did that bastard,
Pellit. But if I do that, I'll
have to spend the rest of my life
running from the law or rotting in
jail.
Police sirens approaching.
DALE
(NEAR TEARS)
So, you're not gonna shoot us?
HARKEN
No. I have a better idea.
Harken turns the gun toward his own thigh and FIRES.
HARKEN
Unnnnhhhh!
NICK
What the -- ?!
As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his
shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale.
HARKEN
Catch.
Startled, Dale catches the pistol with shaking hands.

HARKEN
(THROUGH GRITTED
TEETH)
Now I can tell the cops that when
I discovered you three killed
Pellit, you tried to kill me to
shut me up.
KURT
That's crazy!
Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed
toward them. Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and
drops it.
HARKEN
Is it? Because I don't see a
shred of evidence proving that I
killed Pellit. It's like I've
always told you, Nick. Life is a
marathon and you can't win a
marathon without putting a few
Band-Aids on your nipples.
Nick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won.
Then, from the car's open window they hear:
ON STAR REP (V.O.)
Did I mention that this
conversation is being recorded?
Kurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief.
HARKEN
Who said that?
KURT
(GRINNING)
That's Gregory, our On Star rep.
ON STAR REP (V.O.)
(PROUDLY)
My name is Atmanand!
Harken's face falls. He looks around nervously as the
police cars come to a halt.
HARKEN
You can't -- this isn't --
And with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured
leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch
him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment
together.
(CONTINUED)
114.
134 CONTINUED: (3) 134
NICK
I think this is gonna work out
okay for us.
KURT
I told you.
DALE
(RE: HARKEN)
Should we stop him?
KURT
Probably.
NICK
I've got this.
(looking to heaven)
This is for you, Gam Gam.
Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW
MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken
goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt.
As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of
Harken's neck, pinning him.
HARKEN
Get the fuck off me!
Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure.
KURT
(GENTLY)
Hey, Harken, one last thing?
HARKEN
(BARKING)
What?!
KURT
Your wife gives great head.
Harken struggles wildly but he's helpless.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
SUPERIMPOSE: ONE WEEK LATER
(CONTINUED)
115.
135 CONTINUED: 135
The sun is shining. Birds are chirping. It's a bright,
new day as Kurt heads into the building.
Nick plummets forty feet and lands with a SICKENING
CRUNCH directly onto his own car. Just behind him we see
a parking plaque that reads "Nick Waters, Senior VP of
Sales."
SMASH CUT TO:
141 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 141
Carter stands opposite Nick as before.
CARTER
Sure. No problem, Mr. Waters.
NICK
Thanks, buddy.
Nick smiles and closes the door behind Carter. He
settles into his comfy chair and puts his feet up on the
desk.
NICK
It's good to be the boss.
CUT TO BLACK.
