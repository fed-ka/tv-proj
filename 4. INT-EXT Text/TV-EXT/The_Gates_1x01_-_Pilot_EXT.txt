      -- a well-travelled FORD EXPLORER just outside the entrance.


         Larchmont -like shopping district. Quaint stores and cafes 
      lining the street.  As the Explorer passes through --  

                                  SARAH
                    I didn t know they had all these 
                    cute little shops.


      Beams of rising sun creep down the east side of the house.


      From a sign reading: THE GATES PREPARATORY SCHOOL, we PAN to 
      reveal a bucolic campus nestled in the heart of this gated 
      community.  In the line of approaching, high end, cars, we 
      find the Monohan s Ford Explorer.


      Amidst STUDENTS pouring into the school, we find Charlie at a 
      vending machine.  He drops some coins, presses a button.  
      Nothing.  Presses again.  No luck.

      Just then, among a few GIRLS passing by, we see ANDIE BATES, 
      mixed race, exotic, and somehow even more intelligent than 
      she is beautiful.

                                  ANDIE
                    Forget everything but O.J.  
                          (then, with a smile)
                    All part of the vast conspiracy to 
                    keep us healthy.

      Charlie acknowledges the tip with a nod, and then watches her 
      go. Maybe this place won t be so bad after all.


      From a beautifully landscaped, Mission-style bungalow, we 
      crane down to a parking space, clearly marked: Nick Monohan, 
      Chief of Police, as Nick pulls in.


      An immaculate, late model Mercedes pulls into the driveway.                                                                                    19.



      Nick is standing with Marcus when Dylan s voice is heard.

                                  DYLAN (O.S.)
                    May I help you?

                                  NICK
                    Yeah, it s Chief Monohan. I m here 
                    about the accident.

      And off Nick and Marcus, no idea what awaits them, we --


                                      END ACT ONE                                                                                    21.


                                        ACT TWO


      As Nick and Marcus approach the car --

                                  MARCUS
                    I ll type up a witness report, and 
                    find out what the guy does for a 
                    living.

      Nick, preoccupied, doesn t respond.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    Sir?

                                  NICK
                    Did you notice what the husband 
                    did?

                                  MARCUS
                          (fishing for the answer)
                    Ummmm...

                                  NICK
                    He presented a scenario for the 
                    guy s disappearance.  

                                  MARCUS
                    Maybe he was trying to be helpful.

                                  NICK
                    Or maybe he didn t like where we 
                    were headed.

                                  MARCUS
                    So you think we re onto something?

      Arriving at the car, Nick looks back at the house and nods.

                                  NICK
                    Yeah.  Something.


      A few BAGS in hand, Sarah is walking when she sees --

      THE ART OF TEA

      She stops, thinks.  Should I? 


      PANNING UP from an inter-squad scrimmage, we find Charlie and 
      Dana watching as they pass by on their way home.

                                  DANA
                    You know, this move would be a lot 
                    easier on both of us if you were a 
                    football star.                                                                                    25.


                                    CHARLIE
                    Doesn t seem so hard on you.

                                  DANA
                    Are you really that slow?  I m 
                    masking my true feelings with 
                      enthusiasm so dad doesn t feel so 
                    bad.
                          (beat)
                    You should try it.

      UP AHEAD -- Andie and her fellow MOCK TRIAL MEMBERS are 
      painting the walls of their  booth  when she spots Charlie. 

                                  ANDIE
                    You re late!

      Dana looks at Charlie.  Late for what?

                                    CHARLIE
                    How can I be late when I haven t 
                    joined?

                                  ANDIE
                    Answering a question with a 
                    question.  You re a natural.

      Dana notes the brightening of Charlie s mood as he talks with 
      Andie.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (takes in the  booth )
                    I don t mean to rain on your 
                    parade, but it kinda looks like an 
                      interrogation room.  

                                  ANDIE
                    Yeah, that s kinda the point.

      Andie points to a sign: LIE DETECTOR  $5.00/question.

                                  DANA
                    You have an actual lie detector?

                                  ANDIE
                    Not yet, but Feldman s making one.

      She looks over at FELDMAN, a geeked-out team member.  He 
      waves, absurdly proud.

                                    CHARLIE
                    So... people are gonna pay money to 
                    be caught in a lie?                                                                                    26.


                                  ANDIE
                    No, they re going to pay money to 
                    catch someone else in a lie.

                                    CHARLIE
                    And if this someone doesn t want to 
                    be caught?

                                  ANDIE
                    Then...
                          (realizing he s right)
                    We won t have any customers.  Oh my 
                    god...

      Andie pulls Charlie aside; conspiratorially:

                                  ANDIE (CONT D)
                    Do me a favor.  Please don t say 
                    anything.  It was Feldman s idea, 
                    and he s really excited about it.  
                    Promise?

      Andie still holds Charlie s hand; right now he d promise her 
      anything.


      Coming out of a huddle, Brett lines up in the middle-
      linebacker position.  Quarterback, RILEY, takes position, 
      eyes Brett.

                                  RILEY
                    Yo, Brett.  Your girl hookin  up 
                    with the new guy?

      Riley motions over Brett s shoulder.  Brett turns, sees Andie 
      standing close to Charlie, talking, laughing... 

                                  BRETT
                          (shrugging it off)
                    She wants him for Mock Trial.

                                  RILEY
                    She wants him for something...

      Riley gives Brett and mocking wink -- and that does it.  With 
      the hike, Brett charges through the line, his breath growing 
      more coarse and guttural with each step.  

      Riley fakes the hand-off, drops back when out of nowhere, 
      Brett SLAMS INTO HIM with an animalistic growl, knocking him 
      several yards through the air.                                                                                     27.


      HEARING the HIT, Charlie and Andie turn and watch as COACHES 
      and PLAYERS run to Riley s side.  

      BACK ON BRETT  -- who turns away, trying to gather himself as 
      COACH approaches from behind.  

                                  COACH
                    Creski!

      When Brett fails to turn, Coach grabs him by the helmet, 
      spins him around to reveal his RIGHT EYE now has the PIERCING 
      YELLOWISH COLOR of a WOLF.

                                  BRETT
                    Coach, I m sorry, I --

      Coach stares in shock.  Then, much to our surprise, pulls him 
      closer, whispers sternly --

                                  COACH
                    You lost a contact.

      Brett quickly lowers his head, self-conscious.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    In my office.  Now.

      Coach pushes him off the field, and as he backs away, Brett 
      throws a sideways glance back toward Andie and Charlie.

      ON ANDIE and CHARLIE -- stunned and confused...

                                    CHARLIE
                    Is your boyfriend always that...?

                                  ANDIE
                    No...  Never.

      A CAR HORN sounds -- She turns to see her dad VINCENT, (40), 
      handsome, but certainly not the  exotic  half of Andie. 

                                    VINCENT
                    Come on, Andie, we re late.

                                  ANDIE
                    Gotta go.

      And as Andie heads off to the car --


      Fast friends, Devon leads a grateful Sarah out the door.                                                                                    28.


                                  DEVON
                    Now remember, two cups a day, no 
                    more, no less.

                                  SARAH
                    Are you sure I can t give you 
                    something for this?

                                  DEVON
                    Wouldn t hear of it. First batch is 
                    always free.

      UNKNOWN POV: From across the street, watching the two 
      women... REVERSE TO:


      PEG MUELLER, attractive, but harder around the edges, watches 
      Devon and Sarah as she adds flowers to her empty outdoor 
      tables.  And something in the way her dark eyes narrow makes 
      us feel thankful Sarah wandered into the other shop... 


      Brett is walking home alone when Lukas, the badass who bumped 
      him in the hallway, rides up alongside on a BMX BIKE.  

                                  LUKAS
                    Heard about what happened at 
                    practice.
                          (enjoying himself)
                    Not like you Creski, to violate the 
                     code. 

      Brett glances over at him.

                                  BRETT
                    You re one to talk.

                                  LUKAS
                    Look, I may not be a model citizen, 
                    but I ve never revealed what I am 
                    inside The Gates.  I know if do, 
                    I m dead.

                                  BRETT
                    I know how it works.

                                  LUKAS
                    Really?  Cause if you knew how it 
                    worked, you wouldn t be with Andie.

      Brett stops, gets in Lukas  face.                                                                                    29.


                                  BRETT
                    Look, you wanna go, we ll go...

                                  LUKAS
                          (doesn t even flinch)
                    Easy, we re just trying to help.

      We re?  Brett looks around to see MORE BMX RIDERS seemingly 
      appearing out of nowhere at either end of the street.

                                  LUKAS (CONT D)
                    Anyone other than Coach turns you 
                    around today, you wouldn t be 
                    standing here right now. 

      Knowing Lukas is right, Brett remains silent.

                                  LUKAS (CONT D)
                    You need to come run with us. 

                                  BRETT
                    I m not doing anything with you.  
                    And last time I checked, running 
                    was a violation of the code.

                                  LUKAS
                    Inside the Gates, yeah.  But 
                      outside... all bets are off.

      Off Brett, no denying a part of him is tempted by the offer --


      A police cruiser rolls slowly past...


      As the police car passes by, CAMERA holds on --


      -- the downstairs lights still on.


      Stopping at the guard house on the way out, Claire hands 
      EDDIE the COOKIE TIN.

                                  CLAIRE
                    A little treat for my favorite 
                    guard.

                                  EDDIE
                    You re kidding.  What s the 
                    occasion?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Just trying a new recipe.


      Deep in a canyon, we peer up the slope of the mountain, stars 
      in the distance.  Suddenly, the night silence is shattered by 
      the SCREAMING ENGINE of the Range Rover as it sails off the 
      edge of the mountain, and into the night sky.  Catching the 
      nose as it lands, the truck tumbles end over end toward 
      CAMERA, finally coming to rest against a stack of boulders.

      Then, looking back up the hill, we see Dylan standing at the 
      cliff s edge.


      Dylan makes his way down the slope, arrives at the crash site 
      to find the drivers door open, and Woodbury s battered body 
      hanging halfway out.  After taking a moment to study the 
      scene, he kneels down beside the body, sets the LEFT OVER 
      BLOOD on the ground, and then, taking a deep breath, turns 
      away, gathering courage for the unthinkable. Turning back, 
      his fangs are revealed.  And then, with startling ferocity, 
      he tears into the body, ripping flesh from bone. 


      Claire pulls over on the side a mountain road, searches the 
      surrounding woods.  Then, in the headlights, we see Dylan 
      emerge from the canyon.  

      Claire climbs out as he approaches, and even she is shocked 
      by the sight of her husband, bloodied and dirty. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    What happened?

                                  DYLAN
                    It has to look like coyotes.

      He passes her without another word, opens the trunk, and 
      climbs in.  Claire goes to the back, and is about to shut him

                    I hope it was worth it.

      And as the trunk closes, enveloping us in darkness, we --

      Over BLACK, a PHONE RINGS.  Light switches on to reveal --


      Lunch, as it turns out, is a bottle of WINE.

                                  DEVON
                    ...so he comes in again, but very 
                    sad this time, and says the tea is 
                    finally working.  I said,  Does 
                    that mean you re sleeping together 
                    again?   And he says,  No, she s 
                    sleeping with Jack, the pool man.  
                    Can I have my money back? 
                          (Sarah laughs)
                    My point is that tea can do a lot 
                    of things, but not everything.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  DEVON (CONT'D)
                    So while I m happy to give you 
                    more, I can t help but wonder if 
                    there s something else going on.

                                  SARAH
                    Well, no, not really...

                                  DEVON
                          (leans in slightly)
                    Why don t you tell me what happened 
                    in Chicago.

                                  SARAH
                    Chicago?  How did you...?

                                  DEVON
                    I m sorry.  I just assumed there 
                    was a reason behind your move.

                                  SARAH
                    Well, yeah, I mean, it was a really 
                    tough year...

      Devon waits for more.  And Sarah suddenly finds herself 
      obliging.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Nick was involved in an... 
                    incident.  A shooting.  There were 
                    a lot of unanswered questions... 
                    and he came this close to being 
                      prosecuted.  It got really bad for 
                    us, for the kids... bad to the 
                    point where I was...
                          (confesses)
                    I was scared Nick and I weren t 
                    gonna make it.

      Sarah looks up, stunned that she has revealed so much.

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  I don t know why... 
                    I ve never told that to anyone.

                                  DEVON
                    Well you can tell me anything.
                          (beat)
                    You need someone to trust.

      Devon reaches across the table and places a comforting hand 
      over Sarah s.  Sarah smiles, grateful.                                                                                    41.



      Nick approaches on foot, flashlight out.  He heads up the 
      driveway, then veers toward --

      THE GARAGE.  Tries the side door.  Locked.  Shines the light 
      through the glass but sees nothing out of the ordinary.  So 
      he continues on to...

      THE BACKYARD.  A gardening sheds looms to his left.  Nick 
      carefully opens the door and peers in with the flashlight --


      Claire moves along the wall toward the back patio... and a 
      collision course with Nick.  She reaches the corner and 
      waits, ready to kill.

      In the BACKYARD, Nick moves across the patio along the wall, 
      oblivious to what awaits.  With each step, he moves closer to 
      the corner.  Three steps to go.  Two steps.  One...

      As Nick turns the corner... WHAM!  A hand grabs his shoulder 
      from behind.  Nick spins, gun raised and finds himself face-
      to-face with... DYLAN.  Time stops.  Then --

                                  NICK
                    That s a good way to get shot.

                                  DYLAN
                    I believe you re the one 
                      trespassing.

                                  NICK
                    We got a report of a prowler.

                                  DYLAN
                      A prowler?  In The Gates?

                                  NICK
                    Probably just some kids messing 
                    around.  But I had to check it out.

      Nick is about to go around the corner, but Dylan stops him:

                                  DYLAN
                    This way.  The side gate is locked.

      As the two men move away we TRACK BACK to reveal CLAIRE 
      around the corner.  Hungry, denied and deeply shaken. 


                                    END ACT FOUR                                                                                    48.


                                        ACT FIVE


      Rising sun casts a warm glow on a LARGE BANNER hanging 
      between two oak trees:  The Gates School, 10th Annual Autumn 
      Fair.   As MUSIC KICKS IN, we begin a SERIES OF SCENES --


      Nick is at his desk, the Radcliff file open in front of him.  
      Across the -- 

      BULLPEN -- Marcus and Leigh sit at their desks, well aware of 
      the Chief s mood. Finally, they see Nick get up, grabs his 
      gun and coat, and head out the door.  


      Brett sits on the sidelines, watching the team practice.   
      Looking toward the parking lot he sees Lukas and friends 
      riding the rails on their BMX bikes.  Off Brett, wavering 
      between the two worlds...


      As booths, rides and food stands take shape, we find Devon 
      and Peg arranging their separate booths just a few yards 
      apart, ignoring each other completely.


      -- where the Fair is in full-swing, a good sized CROWD  
      milling around, enjoying the sights, sounds, and rides.

      Sarah, Charlie and Dana approaching when they spot Nick 
      waiting, just ahead.

                                  SARAH
                    I wasn t sure you d make it.                                                                                    52.


                                  NICK
                    Wouldn t miss it.

      Sarah eyes him, a bit skeptical, when Marcus hurries up.

                                  MARCUS
                    Chief?  You got a sec?

      Apologizing to Sarah with a look, Nick steps aside with 
      Marcus.

                                  MARCUS (CONT D)
                    I made some calls and I m pretty 
                    sure I can get us that search 
                    warrant.
                          (off Nick s look)
                    After cocktail hour, Judge 
                    Freeman s pen tends to loosen up.

      Nick looks over to find Sarah watching, waiting. 

                                  NICK
                    Thanks but... we re not gonna need 
                    it.

                                  MARCUS
                    We re not?

                                  NICK
                    No.

      Though full of questions, Marcus responds with a nod.  

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    But Marcus... good work.

      And as Nick returns to Sarah and the kids --

                                  SARAH
                      Everything okay?

                                  NICK
                    Yeah, it s fine.  We re closing the 
                    Radcliff case.
                          (beat)
                    Not enough evidence.

      Nick reaches out for her hand.  Though there is much she d 
      like say, right now it s enough to take his hand, and wrap 
      her fingers in his.  And as they pass --

      PEG S TEA BOOTH - NIGHT

      -- CAMERA finds Claire steping up to the counter.                                                                                    53.


                                  CLAIRE
                    Hi, Peg.

                                  PEG
                          (sensing her troubles)
                    Claire.  Is everything alright?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I need something to help with... 
                    cravings.

                                  WOMAN (V.O.)
                    They can be a real bitch, huh?

      Claire turns to find Devon, offering a knowing smile.  
      Unintimidated, Claire smiles back.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And so can you.

                                  PEG
                          (to Claire)
                    We can talk about this later.

                                  DEVON
                    I think it s a little more urgent, 
                    Peg.
                          (leans in to Claire)
                    Jessica Cooper saw you put that car 
                    in your garage.

      Too shocked to speak or even blink, Claire feigns calm.

                                  DEVON (CONT D)
                    Don t worry.  I helped her forget, 
                    but who knows how long that will 
                    last.

      Anger flares in Claire s eyes as she turns, primal, 
      terrifying.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I could end you, and you d never 
                    see it coming.

                                  DEVON
                          (doesn t even flinch)
                    But that wouldn t really solve your 
                    problem, now would it?

      Peg protectively reaches for Claire.                                                                                    54.


                                  PEG
                          (to Devon)
                    This conversation s over.

                                  DEVON
                          (to Claire)
                    Don t bother with Peg.  She can t 
                    help.  But I have exactly what you 
                    need.  So stop by... anytime.
                          (smiles at both)
                    Enjoy the Fair, ladies.

      And off Claire and Peg watching her go --


      Dylan is watching Emily play when Frank Buckley steps up 
      beside him.  They share a friendly nod and turn back to the 
      kids in the bounce house.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    Sometimes I wish the whole world 
                    could be like that, a place where 
                    no one gets hurt.

                                  DYLAN
                    Isn t that why we re here.

                                    BUCKLEY
                    I hope so.


      As Charlie predicted, not many takers, but Andie still tries.

                                  ANDIE
                    Lie Detector here.  Is she really 
                      satisfied?  Does he honestly like 
                    that outfit?  Find out the truth.  
                    Five dollars.

      Passers-by keep walking, apparently not interested in the 
      truth, until Charlie walks up.  Andie cools.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hey, I was hoping we could talk, 
                    just for a second.

                                  ANDIE
                    I m kinda busy, so...

                                    CHARLIE
                    If you want, I ll pay.                                                                                    55.


      He puts five dollars on the table.  Feldman moves to take it, 
      but Andie snatches it up and says:

                                  ANDIE
                    Not here.


      Charlie and Andie settle away from the crowd.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Look, I didn t mean to freak you 
                    out yesterday.  It s just that...
                    I didn t want to leave Chicago, and 
                    I really didn t want to come here, 
                    but the one thing that s been cool 
                    about all this... is you. 
                          (beat)
                    Now I understand where you are, and 
                    Brett made it clear how he feels 
                    about you, and the last thing I 
                    want to do is get in the middle...

                                  ANDIE
                    But... you already have.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I know, but what I m trying to say 
                    is, I don t want whatever the lie 
                    detector may have picked up on to 
                    make you feel like you have to keep 
                    avoiding me, so --

                                  ANDIE
                    Charlie, stop.
                          (waits, then confesses)
                    I didn t freak out because of how 
                    you feel about me.  I freaked out 
                    because of how I might... feel 
                    about you.

      Off Charlie, stunned by her admission, WE RACK PAST HIM a 
      hundred feet away to find Brett LISTENING, his heart breaking 
      with every word.  Then -- 

                                    FELDMAN (O.S.)
                    Andie!  We have a customer!

      Andie and Charlie look at each other.  Now what?


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    56.


                                        ACT SIX


      Late, but the festival shows no signs of slowing down.  

      UNKNOWN POV as Charlie moves through the crowd, making his 
      way out.

      ON BRETT alone by the game booths, watching Charlie go.  With 
      a chilling sense of purpose, he follows.


      Charlie walks alone down a quiet street and turns a corner. 
      Brett follows, one block back.  

      When Charlie turns another corner, Brett heads down a 
      parallel street, accelerates to a fast but effortless gait.


      Charlie enters this large neighborhood park bordered by 
      woods.  He crosses through an open, grass-covered field.

      IN THE WOODS -- Brett tracks him, concealed by trees...

      IN THE CLEARING -- Charlie HEARS something RUSTLE behind him.  
      He stops, turns toward the woods, listens... Nothing.  He 
      begins to move on when a VOICE CALLS OUT --

                                  ANDIE
                          (loud whisper)
                    Charlie!

      Charlie turns to see Andie emerging from the shadows between 
      two giant oak trees.

                                    CHARLIE
                    So...

                                  ANDIE
                    So...

      IN THE WOODS: BRETT watches as Charlie reaches, touches her 
      cheek. Overwhelmed by his emotions, Brett buries his face in 
      his hands.  But upon looking back up, his eyes are now 
      yellow...

      ON CHARLIE AND ANDIE about to kiss, when --

      IN THE WOODS: BRETT -- now fully transformed into a WEREWOLF-- 
      can t hold himself back.                                                                                      57.


      He s ready to sttsck when suddenly, ANOTHER WEREWOLF LUNGES 
      OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND KNOCKS HIM OUT OF FRAME!

      ON CHARLIE AND ANDIE -- as the SOUND of a brief but intense 
      animal fight comes from the woods.  They both turn...

                                  ANDIE (CONT D)
                    What was that?

                                    CHARLIE
                    No idea.

                                  ANDIE
                    Well...

                                    CHARLIE
                    Let s get outta here.

      IN THE WOODS -- Brett, now back IN HUMAN FORM, looks up at 
      Lukas, also in human form, who holds him pinned to the 
      ground.  

                                  LUKAS
                    Not now.  Not like this.


      Dylan drives along a dark empty street when BLUE AND RED 
      LIGHTS appear behind him.  Glancing into his rearview mirror, 
      he pulls over, waits.  Then Leigh appears at his window.

                                  LEIGH
                    Where you headed so late?

                                  DYLAN
                    Cough medicine.  For my daughter.

                                  LEIGH
                    You sure you want to leave your 
                    wife at home... by herself?

      He looks at her: what s that supposed to mean?

                                  LEIGH (CONT D)
                    I know what s going on, Dylan.

      Though gripped by fear, he remains calm:

                                  DYLAN
                    And what s that?                                                                                    58.


                                  LEIGH
                    Your wife... is sleeping around.  
                    And let s just say she s not very 
                    good at covering her tracks.

      Relieved -- but not about to show it -- he turns to her:

                                  DYLAN
                    Is this police business?

                                  LEIGH
                    No, it s personal.  And if you need 
                    someone to talk to, I m still here.

                                  DYLAN
                          (gently)
                    That s over, Leigh.

                                  LEIGH
                          (sincere)
                    It doesn t have to be.

                                  DYLAN
                    Good night... officer.

      She nods, walks back to her cruiser, leaving Dylan 
        unsettled...


      BRIGHT LIGHTS illuminate the CANYON as Nick, Marcus and Leigh 
      make their way down a very familiar looking slope...

                                  LEIGH
                    They said there s a car about 
                    twenty yards over that ridge.

      Nick approaches the STATE COP in charge:

                                  NICK
                    Got an ID?

                                  STATE COP
                    John Doe for now.  Maybe you can 
                    help us out...

      Nick, Marcus and Leigh make their way to THE BODY, already 
      wrapped in sheets.  Nick pulls back the cover revealing a  
      perfectly preserved corpse.  It s not Mark Woodbury.  And the 
      condition of the body makes it clear: this isn t Claire and 
      Dylan s work.

                                  STATE COP (CONT D)
                    Weird.  Coyotes left him alone.  He 
                    doesn t have a scratch on him.                                                                                    60.


                                  NICK
                    Not our guy.

      He glances up at Marcus and Leigh -- both of whom stare at 
      the body in shock.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    What?

      Marcus turns to him like he s been punched in the gut.

                                  MARCUS
                    It s Phelps -- our old Chief.

      As Nick stares at his predecessor s dead face, that 
      suspicious instinct surfacing again, we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Much like our opening, we find Emily awaiting her carpool at 
      the top of the drive.  Beside her, she rolls her skateboard 
      with her hand, back and forth, back and forth...

      Claire sits atop a landscape stone, lost in thought.  

      UP THE STREET -- Emily sees a car rounding the corner.  She 
      glances briefly at her mother, then back at the car.  With 
      her hand on the board, she waits... waits... waits and then, 
      with one gentle push, sends it rolling down the driveway.  

      It takes a moment for Claire to notice.  But when she does, 
      she stands, just in time to see the car screech to a stop.

      Claire turns to her daughter, stunned by her behavior.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Emily!

                                  EMILY
                    It s okay Mommy.  I won t tell.

      As mother and daughter stare at the car, one conflicted, the 
      other not, we reach --


                                        THE END
