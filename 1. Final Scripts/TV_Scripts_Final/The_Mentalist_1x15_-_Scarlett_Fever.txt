      FADE IN:

      EXT. MARQUESA HOME - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING (N/1)11

      An ostentatious McMansion LIT UP for a party, in a luxury 
      gated country club community filled with homes built to 
      impress.  They re are all different, but exactly alike.

      INT. MARQUESA HOME. FOYER - CONTINUOUS22

      A lively cocktail party is in full swing as CATERERS serve 
      hors d oeuvres to the crowd.  

      INT. UPSTAIRS. MARQUESA HOME33

      SCARLETT MARQUESA, 30 s, beautifully dressed, comes 
      staggering down a hallway, hands at her throat, a choked 
      scream on her lips.  She blindly runs into and over the top 
      bannister overlooking the foyer.  She falls -- crash landing 
      on a table of hors d oeuvres -- to her death.    

      As pandemonium ensues, a little boy -- OSCAR MARQUESA -- 
      curly black hair, nine-years-old, comes out of his room, 
      peers down through the banister and sees his mother s 
      contorted body on the floor below.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - NIGHT44

      JANE, opposite a shaven-headed tattooed GANGSTER, who gazes 
      intently at a shiny .45 Caliber SILVER BULLET Jane is holding 
      between thumb and forefinger.  

                                  JANE
                    ...Look at it, George.  Beautiful, 
                    isn t it?  Look at that.  Like a 
                    little jewel.  Or a child s toy.  
                    Wouldn t it be good if you could 
                    relax and go back to a time when 
                    you were a child?  A little boy 
                    with no cares or worries. You can 
                    go back if you want if you think 
                    about it, if you just close your 
                    eyes and drift away.  That s right.  
                    Don t you feel happy and relaxed?    

                                  GANGSTER
                    Yes...

      The Gangster is in a light trance.

                                  JANE
                    Say it.  Tell me how you feel.

      INT. OBSERVATION ROOM. CBI HQ - CONTINUOUS55

      TWO AGENTS from the Organized Crime Squad are watching.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - CONTINUOUS66

                                  JANE
                    Tell me, George, what s your date 
                    of birth? 

                                  GANGSTER
                    I was born on the first of March, 
                    1980.

                                  JANE
                    That s right.  What was your 
                    mother s name?

                                  GANGSTER
                    Melody.

                                  JANE
                    That s a nice name.  She was a good 
                    woman.  She liked you to tell the 
                    truth, didn t she?

                                  GANGSTER
                    Yes.

                                  JANE
                    Good.  Now tell me how you murdered 
                    Donovan Hobart and -- 

      LISBON enters in a hurry.

                    Jane, sorry to interrupt, we just 
                    caught a red ball.  Are you going 
                    to be long with this one --

      She notices the gangster s weird demeanor.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Dammit Jane, he s in a trance isn t 
                    he?   

                                  JANE
                    I d describe it as more like deep 
                      relaxation.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      3.

                    I m doing a favor for the organized

      She knocks on the two-way glass mirror.

                    Time to go, guys.

                    I was just about to get the truth 
                    from him.  He killed two people.  
                    If you walk out very quietly, I

                    -- Calm yourself, woman.  No big

                    Oh really.  This man s lawyer is 
                    right this minute coming down the 
                    hall, wearing a mean face, and 
                    something tells me he will dispute 
                    that point with you.  Let s go.

                                  JANE
                    Let me bring George back out of his 
                    trance first eh? 

                                  LISBON
                    Be quick about it.

                    Yes, ma am.  George?  Listen to me 
                      carefully...

        A hard-faced CRIMINAL LAWYER enters.  

                                  LAWYER

      She gestures to Jane --  Get out!   Jane shakes George s 
      hand.

                                  JANE 
                    It was nice to meet you, George, 
                    Good luck in all your future 
                      endeavors.

      Lisbon and Jane leave.  Lawyer sits down.  George is still 
      lightly tranced. 

                                  LAWYER
                    So, George... George?  Are you 
                    alright?   

      George just stares at him placidly.

      Jane and Lisbon hurry away.  Jane s amused.

                    It s not funny.

      COPS and FORENSICS people moving about.  Scarlett, on the 
      floor, the CORONER S MEN about to take her away, waiting for 
      photos to be taken of the body.

      Jane and Lisbon enter and are met by RIGSBY who briefs them.

                      ...Hostess of the party, married,

                    this evening, the party was in full  
                    swing.  Scarlett comes running over 
                    the balcony clutching her throat 
                    and screaming, she falls down to 
                    her death.

                          (looking at the body)
                    Poison uh?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Must be.  The discoloration, the 
                    frothing at the lips.  The medical  
                    examiner thinks so too.  But we 
                    haven t found a source yet.  We 
                    don t know where she was when she 
                    drank the poison.  
                          (indicating direction)
                    She came from up there, but the 
                    actual poisoning could have taken 
                    place anywhere.  It s a big house. 

      The Coroner s men start to lift Scarlett onto a gurney.  Jane 
      stops them.

                                  JANE
                    One moment.

      He studies her face.

                      Interesting.  Look at her eyes.

                    Hello.  Use your words.

      Lisbon sighs.  She isn t going after him.  She looks to 
      Rigsby, who dutifully follows Jane.

                    eye than she did on her left.  
                    Meaning she must have been halfway

                    was poisoned.  Sooo, she was in

      He ducks into a room.

      He looks around a bit and uses a handkerchief to pick up a 
      cocktail tumbler from the floor under the basin.

                    The source of the poison, I have no 
                    doubt.

      As he studies the glass, he notices lipstick further down on 
      the glass, far away from the rim where it would have been 
      deposited by drinking from the glass.  He looks around and 
      then peers into the waste bin where he reaches in and comes 
      up with a crumpled napkin.  He uncrumples it.  Reads:

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    And here...

      He turns it around so Rigsby can see...

      upscale, but moving down.  Amid the ostentatious luxury are 
       FOR SALE  and  OPEN HOUSE  SIGNS outside houses.  A MOVING 
      TRUCK is backed up in a driveway. 

      EXT. MARQUESA HOME - DAY1414

      As Jane and Lisbon walk toward the house from the van,  
      VICTOR MARQUESA, late 30 s, stunned, weary, and drawn, in 
      slacks, is at the front door, saying goodbye to ASRA HADAMI, 
      30 s, serious, raven-haired beauty in a business suit, and 
      MANDY RILJEK, 30 s, athletic, tough but perky, sporting pink 
      tennis togs.  He hugs each of the women, lingering a bit 
      longer on the hug with Asra.  Jane clocks this awkward hug 
      with interest.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Marquesa.  Agent Lisbon, CBI.

                                  VICTOR
                    Oh yes.  Please come in.

      He notes her significant glance to the two women...

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    These are dear friends, Asra 
                    Hadami, and Mandy Riljek.  They ve 
                    been looking after me and Oscar. 

      The two women acknowledge the agents.

                                  ASRA
                    Anything we can do...

      Lisbon nods politely...

                    Vic, I ll make sure Jim comes by as

                                  VICTOR
                    Thanks, Mandy.

                                  ASRA
                    Take care, Victor.

      Jane watches as Asra and Mandy walk away.          THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      8.


      INT. FOYER. MARQUESA HOME - MOMENTS LATER1515

      The room still has not been cleared from the day before as 
      police tape and broken furniture clutters the scene.  Victor 
      comes down the stairs with a HANDBAG and a PHONE and gives 
      them to an awaiting Lisbon and Jane.  

                                  VICTOR
                    Scarlett keeps everything in there. 
                    Very organized.

                    soon as we can.

      Victor nods and they follow him.  Jane takes Scarlett s bag 
      and looks through it discreetly while they walk into --

      INT. KITCHEN. MARQUESA HOME - MOMENTS LATER15A15A

      All the available counter space is covered with glasses, 
      silverware, and dishes from the night before.  Victor shows 
      them to a breakfast nook table where they all take seats.

                    us your wife s drink was laced with

                    No.  She was the artistic type.  
                    She made jewelry, that was her 
                    thing.  Made a pretty good business 
                    out of it in fact.  Selling to

                    Sure.  They were from the country 
                    club mostly.  Scarlett was elected 
                    chair of the women s committee there, 
                    which is kind of a big deal in this 
                      community?  Very prestigious.  I was 
                    so proud of her, although it meant 
                    she had to spend a lot of her time at 
                    the club.

      Oscar comes to a full stop, looks at his dad before silently 
      darting out of the room.  Lisbon and Jane look on awkwardly.

                    Sure thing.  

      She reaches for the microphone.  Rigsby gestures, wait...

                    Uh, perhaps it d be best to gather

      EXT. ROSE COURTYARD. MARSANTE COUNTRY CLUB - DAY1919

      Heather, Patience Broadbent, Mandy Riljek, and JACKIE SHAPER 
      (40 s, an extrovert, kinda slutty, dramatic, good-hearted),  
      cluster on the court along with Rigsby and Jane, several of 
      each on either side of the net.  There s already a 
      perceptible tension between the women.  NB we don t put focus 
      on it, but all of the women, except Heather, are wearing 
      items made by Scarlett.

                    Thank God you re here.  You ll find 
                    this maniac, won t you?

                                  JANE
                    We ll try.  Were you all at 
                      Scarlett s party?

      All nod and say yes together.

                    Everyone has to go to the 
                      chairwoman s parties.  It s a rule.

      Jane notes Jackie gives Patience a scowl.

                                  JANE
                      Chairwoman s a prestigious

                    She makes her share of enemies I 
                    expect.

      Jackie looks hard at Patience.

                                  JACKIE
                    You could say that.

                                  PATIENCE
                    If you have something to say, say 
                    it.  Speak your mind, bitch. 

                                  JACKIE
                    Oh okay.  You want it all out 
                    there?  Okay.  He asked about 
                    enemies.  That s what you were.  
                          (to Jane and Rigsby)
                    She hated Scarlett because she 
                    wanted to be chair and Scarlett 
                    whipped her butt in the election.  
                    Schooled her.  Right, Mandy?

                                  MANDY
                    Oh, I m not getting into this one. 

                                  PATIENCE
                    Right.  I missed out on scoring  
                    the private office and all that 
                    cool stationery with my name on it, 
                    so I killed her.  Have you any idea 
                    how idiotic you sound?

      Rigsby jumps in quickly.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Tell you what, it s probably best 
                    if we conduct separate interviews 
                    with each of you individually.

                    I don t know if I should tell you, 
                    but I saw Scarlett arguing with 
                    Asra Hadami?  It looked kind of 
                    angry.  Some say something more 
                    than business might be going on 
                    between Asra Hadami and Victor 
                    Marquesa.  I don t know if that s 
                    true.  I don t really follow the 
                    gossip.

                    We re told you re the gossip queen 
                    around here.

                                  MANDY
                          (complacently)
                    People tell me things.

                                  JANE
                    Who s Victor Marquesa having an 
                    affair with?

                                  MANDY
                          (delighted)
                    I don t know.  Who?  Tell. 

                                  JANE
                    Asra Hadami.

      Mandy blurts out laughing, and stops herself quickly.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    That s a funny idea?

                                  MANDY
                          (serious)
                    No.  It s just, no.  Victor and 
                    Asra are good friends, nothing 
                    more.  Asra had nothing to do with 
                    this.

                                  JANE
                    No?  What s the general opinion 
                    then?  Who did this?

                                  RIGSBY
                    What makes you think that?

                                  MANDY
                    Nothing really.  Victor s a nice 
                    guy, but that s who kills women, 
                    isn t it?  Their husbands.  Ninety 
                    percent of the time.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Seventy percent, I think.

                    Nice play out there.  You could 
                    maybe put more topspin on your 
                    returns.

                                  PATIENCE
                    The answers are yes, I disliked 
                    her, no I didn t kill her.

                    Yes, unlike all those many people 
                    that love it. 

      As they speak, DOLORES, wearing several layers of clothing 
      even though it s warm, attempts to approach Patience.  She is 
      tired and shivering a bit, but has a hopeful expression.  
      There is a noticeable shift in Patience s demeanor when she 
      sees her.

      Van Pelt slowly paces as she questions Asra.  Lisbon hangs in 
      the back.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Why were you running, Ms. Hadami?

                                  ASRA
                    No reason.  Stress.  I needed 
                    space.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      23.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Nothing to do with the argument you 
                    had with Scarlett Marquesa the 
                    night she died?

                                  ASRA
                    I didn t have an argument with her.

                                  VAN PELT
                    We hear differently.

                                  ASRA
                    No argument.  I swear.  I didn t 
                    kill her.  This is absurd. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    No more absurd than you clearing 
                    out your accounts and abandoning 
                    your home for  no reason. 

                                  ASRA
                    Maybe I need a lawyer.

      Van Pelt looks to Lisbon who nods for her to press on.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Say the word.  What he ll tell you, 
                    if you re not involved in the 
                    murder, best speak up. 

                                  ASRA 
                    I ran because I knew the murder 
                    would expose some issues I would 
                    like to keep private.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Such as your relationship with 
                    Mandy Riljek?

                                  ASRA
                    Exactly.  News like that could be 
                    ruinous.

                                  VAN PELT
                    True, but not the kind of thing you 
                    abandon your house for.  You said 
                    issues.  What are the other issues?

      Asra indicates truth being told...

                                  ASRA
                    I didn t want to look Victor in the 
                    face and tell him that I d helped 
                    run everything he d worked so hard 
                    for into the ground.

                                  VAN PELT
                    How did you help do that?

                                  ASRA
                      I borrowed money from the company s 
                    cash reserve.

                                  VAN PELT
                    How much?

                                  ASRA
                    A little over half a million.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Where did it go?

                                  ASRA
                    I made some poor investment choices 
                    that I had to cover quickly.

                                  VAN PELT
                    So you stole --

                                  ASRA
                      I borrowed.  From the reserves.  I 
                    skimmed the money from each 
                      development deal that should have 
                    gone into the company s reserve 
                    account as back up.  We were making 
                    so many deals, I knew I would get 
                    it back before it would matter.  
                    But then the deals and the funding 
                    dried up and suddenly that reserve 
                    was very important.  I sold 
                    anything I could get my hands on to 
                    cover the money.

      Van Pelt again looks back at Lisbon who gives her approval of 
      how she handled the questioning.  Van Pelt is pleased.

      Lisbon and Van Pelt talk to Victor.  Oscar runs in and out 
      dressed as a WIZARD.

                    I can t believe it.  Asra s been 
                    with me for over five years.  She 
                    was right there with me in the 
                    trenches.  I can t believe it.   

        Robotically, Victor pulls out  fixins  and begins making a 
      sandwich.

                    After going over your accounts, we

                    Those are some pretty hefty

                    It was, but apparently she had a 
                    lot of interest in her pieces.  She

                                  VAN PELT
                    Wardell Suggs, AKA  Digger.   He s 
                    been arrested for several counts of 
                    petty theft, fraud and assault.

                    It could be better.

                                  LISBON
                    Why were you meeting Scarlett?

                    What did she tell you about me?

                                  LISBON
                    Nothing.  She s dead.

      This straightens Wardell up.

                                    WARDELL
                    I had nothing to do with that.  
                    What happened to her?

                    Hey boss, come take a look.

      Lisbon comes around and Cho hands her several BAGGIES filled 
      with different types of pills.  The false bottom of the van 
      is filled with bags just like it.  Lisbon takes a bag of 
      pills and shakes them in front of a crestfallen Wardell.

                    Let s talk uh?

                                    WARDELL
                    What the hell, I have a strike to 
                    give.  Scarlett was one of my 
                    biggest customers.  Diet pills, 
                      tranquilizers, painkillers.  By the 
                    hundreds.  

                                  LISBON
                    Scarlett was dealing prescription 
                    drugs?

                                    WARDELL
                    Yup.

                                  LISBON
                    How did you two meet?

                    Swap meet.  She was trying to sell 
                    that God awful jewelry.  She looked 
                    desperate so I told her there are 
                    easier ways to make money.

                                  CHO
                    Were you doing a deal tonight?

                                    WARDELL
                    Supposed to.  Lately, I d have to 
                    listen to her yammer about 
                    quitting, and then she d buy some 
                    bags saying this was her last time 
                    doing it.  Of course she d always 
                    come back.  

                                  LISBON
                    So she wanted to quit?

                                    WARDELL 
                    Yup.  Matter of fact, a couple of 
                    weeks ago, I started getting calls 
                    from a girl who said Scarlett had 
                    given her my info.  Same prissy 
                    kind of voice.  Chick said she d be 
                      interested in setting up her own 
                    situation when Scarlett quit.

                                  LISBON
                    This  chick  got a name?

                    at first, but I do have her number.

                                  LISBON
                    Why don t you give her a call.

      Van Pelt grabs Wardell s phone from the car hood, opens it, 
      and scrolls through as he points out the number.  She dials.

      INT. CHAIRWOMAN S OFFICE - NIGHT3737

      Rigsby and Jane sit in darkness.

      They HEAR the RUSTLE OF KEYS at the door as it opens.  A 
      shadowy figure -- that we soon recognize as Patience -- makes 
      her way to the safe and inserts a key.  Opens it.  Looks 
      inside and takes out a plastic bag full of pill bottles.  
      Just then, her CELL PHONE RINGS and Patience answers it.

                                  PATIENCE
                    Digger, why are you calling me now?

      The LIGHT FLICKS ON and Patience finds herself standing in 
      front of Rigsby and Jane.

      Rigsby watches while Patience calmly powders the shiny spots 
      of her face with a compact using the two-way mirror.

                                  RIGSBY
                    How did you come to have Scarlett 
                      Marquesa s keys?

                                  PATIENCE
                    I took them when I went to offer my 
                      condolences to Victor.  Naughty I 
                    know, but I couldn t wait.

                                  RIGSBY
                    It s not naughty.  It s a felony. 
                    You wanted to get your hands on her 
                    pill supply.

                                  PATIENCE
                    Nonsense.  I opened that safe out 
                    of idle curiosity.  I had no idea 
                    there were any pills in there.  I 
                    simply wanted to measure the 
                    windows for new drapes.  I ll be 
                    the next chair of the committee.

                    She was doing a booming business.  
                    And you wanted a part of it.  Maybe 
                    a little too much.

                    So I killed her?  Please.  Hello!  
                    She was a drug dealer.  People she 
                    dealt with must have done her in.  
                    Other dealers.

                    Or a highly capable rival right in 
                    the middle of her own community.

      Patience sits up.  She s all business as she stares Rigsby 
      down.

                    You ve found no drugs or poison on

                    only opened that safe out of idle 
                      curiosity.  You taped together your 
                    whole theory with a couple of idle 
                      conversations I had with a drug 
                    dealer.  Does that about sum it up?

                    Using jewelry sales as a cover, 
                    your wife was selling prescription 
                    pills.  Painkillers mostly.  Speed.  
                    Diet pills.  All kinds.  Some 
                    stolen from pharmacies and others 
                    coming in from Mexico.

      Victor sits down, feeling weak.

                    You seem genuinely surprised.  A

                    about it.

                    since this is an ongoing case.

                                  JACKIE
                    Now you know you can t leave 
                    something like that hanging.

                                  JANE
                    Promise this stays just between us?

      The women nod as they lean in a little closer in anticipation 
      of some juicy gossip.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    We re going after Victor Marquesa.

                      Victor?... I don t believe it... He 
                    doesn t look like the type.

                                    HEATHER
                    On what grounds?

                                  JANE
                    We think he killed Patience out of 
                    revenge for the murder of his wife.

                                    HEATHER
                    But you said there was no proof 
                    Patience was guilty?

                                  JANE
                    I guess Victor didn t want to wait 
                    for proof.

                                  JACKIE
                    What s going to happen to Oscar?

                                  JANE
                    Mom murdered and now his dad s a 
                    murderer.  Once his father is 
                    arrested, he s going to be placed 
                    in foster care.

                                    HEATHER
                    Oh how dreadful.  That poor child.  

      Jane sits there looking solemn.

      EXT. MARQUESA HOME - LATER4848

      CBI has parked both their TRUCK and CAR in front of the home.  
      The street and driveway are littered with SPECTATORS.  No one 
      is holding them back.  Jane and Lisbon get out of the truck 
      and survey the crowd.

                                  JANE
                    I guess they couldn t keep the 
                    secret.

                                  LISBON
                      Apparently not.  Let s do this.

      The door opens and Victor, looking grim, is escorted out by 
      Rigsby.  Cho comes out with Oscar looking equally sad.  When  *
      they reach the sidewalk, CBI allows Victor a moment with 
      Oscar.  He pats Oscar on the head.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      47.

                      Everything is going to be fine.    
                      I promise.

      He hugs Oscar tight and then acknowledges that he is ready.

                                  OSCAR
                    Dad, where are you going?

                                  VICTOR
                    I ll be okay.

      Victor walks to the truck.  Cho takes Oscar by the hand.

                                  OSCAR
                    Dad?

                                  VICTOR
                    It s okay, buddy.

      They open the truck doors.

                                  OSCAR
                          (louder)
                    Dad!

      He tries to pull away from Cho.  As Victor gets in the truck, 
      Oscar has a meltdown.  Cho picks him up.

                                  OSCAR (CONT D)
                    DAD!  DAD!

      Oscar reaches out as Cho takes him to the car.  Jane SLAMS 
      the truck door shut.  The crowd is quietly horrified.

                                    HEATHER (O.S.)
                    STOP!!

      Heather pushes through the crowd.  Jane blocks her way. 

                                    HEATHER (CONT D)
                    You have to stop this!

                                  JANE
                    It s okay, Heather, justice is 
                    being served.

                                    HEATHER
                    How can you say that?  Look what 
                    you re putting that boy through!

                                  JANE
                    He ll forget eventually.  It s 
                    fine.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      48.

                    No.  No it s not.

      Heather tries to push forward, but Jane again gets in her way.

                                  JANE
                    Why?

                                    HEATHER
                          (exasperated)
                    BECAUSE I DID IT!

                                  JANE
                    Did what?

                                    HEATHER
                    I killed them.  I killed them both.

      Heather, now beside herself, falls into Jane s arms.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - LATER4949

      Jane sits before Heather.  Lisbon hangs in the back.

                                  JANE
                    I first suspected it was you 
                    because it seemed like everybody 
                    else at the club wore some of 
                      Scarlett s jewelry.  But not you.  

                                    HEATHER
                    That s it?  Jewelry?

                                  JANE
                    The more we talked, the more I felt 
                    your pain and anger.  Losing your 
                    daughter has unhinged you.

                                    HEATHER 
                    Unhinged.  Yes.  I suppose I am. 
                    My daughter loved to dance.  Didn t 
                    matter what kind of music, a toe 
                    would start tapping.  She was so 
                    full of life.  
                          (beat)
                    She d taken several painkillers 
                    with alcohol before she got behind 
                    the wheel.  One of her neighborhood 
                    friends got them from her mother.  
                    Who got them from Scarlett. 

                                  JANE
                      I understand your anger.

                    It was like they ripped my soul out 
                    clean.  But, the rest of the world 
                    kept moving right along.  It was 
                    like I was the only one who 
                      remembered what happened.

      FLASHBACK

      INT. MARQUESA HOME. FOYER - NIGHT (N/1)5050

      Drink in hand, Heather sees Scarlett, Patience, and other 
      women giddily passing around a tube of lipstick.  They crowd 
      around the mirror trying it on.  As soon as it hits the 
      table, Heather swipes it.

                                    HEATHER (V.O.)
                    So when I saw her flitting about 
                    town selling pills without a care 
                    in the world, still hosting parties 
                    at her house... happily dancing 
                    around without a stitch of the 
                    misery I was carrying, I snapped.

      INT. STUDY. MARQUESA HOME - CONTINUOUS (N/1)5151

      Heather pours a powdery substance into the drink tumbler and 
      stirs it around.  Then she writes a note with the lipstick, 
      puts the napkin around the glass, and heads back out.

                                    HEATHER (V.O.)
                    I killed her.  I didn t want any 
                    other person to have to experience 
                    what I did.

      INT. MARQUESA HOME FOYER - CONTINUOUS (N/1)5252

      Pretending to be a little tipsy, Heather hugs Scarlett and 
      swaps out her nearly empty drink with the fresh poisoned one 
      with the napkin.  Scarlett readily accepts it.  Heather pats 
      her on the back before disappearing into the crowd.

      INT. BATHROOM. MARQUESA HOME - NIGHT (N/1)A52AA52A

      Scarlett has been drinking on her new beverage for a while as 
      she reapplies her make-up.  She sees the tumbler in the 
      reflection of the mirror and notices the napkin.  She pulls 
      the napkin off the glass and reads it, crumpling it up and 
      throwing it in the wastebasket.  She begins to feel weird and 
      starts clutching at her throat.

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    And Patience?        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      50.


      INT. MASSAGE ROOM. MARSANTE COUNTRY CLUB - DAY (D/4)52A52A

      Patience lies on her back covered with a sheet.  She is 
      blissed-out with a face mask and cucumber slices covering her 
      eyes.  We see a knife inch toward her.

                                    HEATHER (V.O.)
                    She told everyone at the club not 
                    to worry, she s going to take over 
                      Scarlett s business, and keep the 
                    pills coming.  Like nothing had 
                    happened.  Like no lessons had been 
                    learned.  I had to finish what I 
                    started.  I had to.

                    And now that it s done, do you feel

      Heather slowly drops her head and begins to cry.

                    It doesn t change a thing.

                    Sorry.  The make believe was 
                      unorthodox, and unpleasant frankly,

                    It was useful to hear some straight

      As Victor and Oscar exit, they cross Jane entering.  He

      Rigsby turns to see Jackie in all her fierce kitty glory 
      standing by the entrance.  She gives a little wave.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Oh, yes.  I invited her to lunch.

      Rigsby collects his coat from his chair and heads off to meet 
      Jackie at the front.  Van Pelt looks surprised.  Jane looks 
      amused.
