RICK STEVENS, thirty-six, is Middle America personified. He
blends in at the crowded ballpark. Blue jeans, work boots, a
ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire. He snacks on
a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on
their feet. A BALL PLAYER slides safely into second with a
double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks
on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected
by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd.
RICK
Helluva talent, that kid.
John flashes a quick grin, never missing a beat in his phone
call.
RICK
Probably be in the bigs in another
year.
John nods, smiles and turns away from Rick to continue
uninterrupted.
CUT TO:
John still talks on his cell.
RICK
Must be something to have that kind
of talent. He's just a kid,
nineteen, twenty tops, and if he
stays healthy and he stays focused,
the world is his oyster. Guys like
you and me, we squandered those
opportunities long ago.
John ends his call and turns back to Rick.
JOHN
You.
RICK
Huh?
JOHN
Guys like you...
RICK
And me...
JOHN
... squandered opportunities. I, on
the other hand, knew where I was
going. I had that kind of drive, I
just never had the talent.
RICK
You knew where you were going?
3.
JOHN
Absolutely.
RICK
At nineteen?
JOHN
Without question.
RICK
The only thing I knew for certain
was that I would run to the corner
store every day for beer.
CUT TO:
Melanie pulls into a parking space and turns the car off.
MELANIE
Lock your door. I'll be right back.
Melanie opens her door.
ZACH
Mom?
Melanie pops her head back in the car.
MELANIE
What?
ZACH
I'm not thirteen. It's against the
law to leave me alone in a car
until I'm thirteen.
MELANIE
Come on.
Zach EXITS.
CUT TO:
John's phone RINGS. He ignores the call.
JOHN
I had priorities. I understood what
it meant to have an attention span.
4.
RICK
You could focus?
JOHN
I was the King of Focus.
RICK
The Duke of Diligence?
JOHN
The Count of Concentration.
Rick is still looking at John when he hears the CRACK of the
bat.
RICK
Duck.
JOHN
Huh?
Rick ducks. John appears perplexed. John's POV: A foul ball
is screaming in his direction. Too late: The ball strikes
John in the face knocking him out of his seat. Rick recovers
and continues to snack on his popcorn.
RICK
The Polestar Prince.
CUT TO:
The game is over. Rick and John stand at the front gate. The
exiting CROWD flows around them. John holds an ice pack to
the side of his face.
JOHN
I'm just saying grow up. You can't
keep drifting.
RICK
I thought I did grow up...
JOHN
When you got married?
RICK
Yeah...
JOHN
You matured a little.
RICK
It's a process.
JOHN
No Bueller, it's a decision. One
you need to make. You can't keep
running without direction. If you
don't know where you're going
you'll never get what you want.
CUT TO:
The crowd has waned.
RICK
I thought I got direction...
JOHN
When Cindy had kids?
RICK
Yeah...
JOHN
They gave you purpose. But purpose,
my friend, is not direction.
RICK
East.
JOHN
Huh?
7.
RICK
My direction is east. I parked in
the deck.
JOHN
I'm right around the...
RICK
Corner?
JOHN
Yeah.
RICK
We're always going in different
directions.
JOHN
Mine are much more productive.
RICK
And much less adventurous.
JOHN
Well, I'm gonna...
RICK
Go?
JOHN
Yeah.
RICK
Then go.
JOHN
That's what I'm going to do.
Responsibility calls.
John turns and heads south. Rick takes a bite of popcorn,
looks to the sky for a moment, grins, and heads off
Northeast.
CUT TO:
John jogs up behind Rick.
JOHN
You want to...
RICK
Get a beer?
JOHN
Yeah.
RICK
Can't.
JOHN
Can't?
RICK
Gotta get home.
JOHN
Why?
RICK
Family, my man. Take time off for a
ballgame ya should probably tend to
the family too. You should try it
sometime.
JOHN
In the grand scheme of things
family is a liability, not an
asset. Rick continues on.
JOHN
(Calling out.)
Do you even know what you're doing
or where you're going?
RICK
(Yelling over his
shoulder.)
East.
JOHN
East leads nowhere, my friend. You
should be heading south. The bar is
south. East takes you places you
don't want to go.
9.
Rick reaches the corner and darts across the street.
CUT TO:
Rick walks East on Buchtel as Police cruiser creeps behind.
Rick appears dumbfounded as the officers exit the cruiser
with guns drawn. Officer One remains stationary. Officer Two
circles behind Rick.
OFFICER ONE
Get em up. Up I said... up.
RICK
Huh?
OFFICER TWO
Get `em where we can see `em
slimeball.
Rick raises his hands, dropping his popcorn.
11.
OFFICER ONE
Oh, we got ourselves a litterbug
here.
RICK
What?
Placing his pistol back in his holster Officer Two grabs Rick
by the collar and throws him against the cruiser. Officer One
remains drawn on Rick. His hands shake with nervous
anticipation.
RICK
What's going...
OFFICER ONE
Shaddup!
Officer Two cuffs Rick. Leaning in, he speaks in Rick's ear.
OFFICER TWO
You know your rights, cretin, but
just in case you don't...
RICK
What the hell? Officer Two spins
Rick to face him.
OFFICER TWO
You have the right to shut the hell
up. Do you understand this right?
RICK
Yes.
Officer One appears very eager to discharge his weapon.
OFFICER ONE
Shut him the hell up, Jimmy.
OFFICER TWO
If you don't shut the hell up my
partner might exercise his right to
shoot you. Do you understand?
`Yes' begins to form on Rick's lips. A quick glance at
Officer One and he decides to nod.
OFFICER ONE
He's looking at me funny, Jimmy.
12.
OFFICER TWO
You have the right not to look at
my partner in any way that might be
construed as `funny' which could
result in harm to your person. Do
you understand this right?
Rick nods again.
OFFICER ONE
He twitching?
OFFICER TWO
Really? I don't think he is. Are
you twitching boy?
RICK
No Sir.
OFFICER ONE
Look at him, he's twitching.
Nothing pisses me off more than
twitching and talking. If he
doesn't stop I'm gonna waste him.
OFFICER TWO
You have the right not to twitch or
shiver or make any other odd
movements that might encourage my
partner to discharge his weapon, do
you understand?
CUT TO:
An unmarked car pulls on scene. The door opens. Low in on
walking feet and pan up to reveal DETECTIVE JOHNSON, (50's),
a gruff man in tweed.
13.
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
What do we got here boys?
OFFICER TWO
It's him. We got him.
OFFICER ONE
He's a twitcher... a twitcher and a
talker. Boy, I tell you, if he'd
twitched one more time I would've
deposited large amounts of hot lead
in his ass.
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
I'll take it from here boys.
OFFICER TWO
Report too?
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
No, that's your job.
OFFICER ONE
If we have to write the report I
say I get to shoot him.
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
No one's getting shot today, Bobby.
OFFICER ONE
Can't I just wing him or something?
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
Jimmy; get him out of here.
Officer Two moves to his unwilling partner and helps him
place his weapon in his holster. Officer One's hand is still
clenched to his gun as Officer Two drags him around the car
and forces him into the cruiser.
CUT TO:
Shaved and wearing sunglasses, Rick approaches his parents.
He reaches his FATHER, (60's), first.
FATHER
Quite the pickle you've got
yourself in.
RICK
So it seems.
Rick's MOTHER gives him a big hug.
25.
MOTHER
She was no good for you. I knew it
from the start.
RICK
Mom, don't... okay?
MOTHER
Just saying...
RICK
I know, but what's done is done.
The children notice their grandparents and run to greet them.
They tackle their grandfather's legs.
FATHER
There's my boys.
BOYS IN UNISON
Grandpa. Rick and his mother sit at a picnic table while the
boys play with their grandfather.
MOTHER
You're dad and I are here for you.
RICK
I know mom.
MOTHER
Are you eating?
RICK
Yeah, I guess.
MOTHER
Do you need anything? Food? Money?
RICK
Watch the kids one night? I could
use some time to myself.
MOTHER
Um... Yeah... okay... I suppose
that would be all right... we'd
have to ask your father, but I
don't see why that would be a
problem.
(a beat)
Other than that everything's okay?
26.
RICK
We're okay...
MOTHER
Because it doesn't have to be like
this. Mary Ryan, a friend of mine,
her son had the same thing happen
to him. Wife just up and left with
no warning at all. He didn't waste
a day. No sir, he was up and at `em
almost instantly. You can leave
here, you know? Mary Ryan's son
did.
RICK
I like it here, mom.
MOTHER
What's to like? It's dingy and
filthy. It's no place to raise
children.
RICK
It's home and it's stable. The one
thing the boys need right now is
stability.
MOTHER
You can't keep hiding forever.
RICK
It's been five days, mom. I'm not
hiding. I just need time to adjust.
MOTHER
Mary Ryan's son thinks you're
hiding.
RICK
Do I know this guy?
Rick's mother slides a business card across the picnic table.
MOTHER
No, but I think you should. I hate
that woman. How can a mother
abandon her kids? How could she do
this to my babies?
Rick looks to a blue sky.
DISSOLVE TO:
27.
CU. on a wad of blue cotton candy. Pull back to reveal Cindy
and her new beau, SCOTT, (30's) and leather clad. Danger
personified. Cindy walks, focused on her cotton candy. She
doesn't realize that Scott has stopped to watch a HOTTIE walk
past. The two exchange a flirtatious glance.
CINDY
Scott? Scott?
SCOTT
(Catching up)
Yeah baby?
MOTHER (VO)
I hope she's living in hell too.
CUT TO:
Rick fumbles with his keys as he unlocks his car door.
CUT TO:
The clock reads 7:55 as Rick shuts off his car and opens the
door.
CUT TO:
TRACKING BESIDE, Rick reaches the door and opens it.
CUT TO:
32.
Rick loads the kids into the car.
CUT TO:
Rick pulls through the drive-thru, takes his order from a
smiling EMPLOYEE, and doles out the grub the as he drives
off.
34.
Rick walks with his mother. The boys and their Grandfather
are a few steps ahead.
RICK
I'm not even responsible for
myself. How am I suppose to raise
three kids?
MOTHER
It can be done.
RICK
I don't see how.
MOTHER
Find a way. Everything happens for
a reason. God doesn't abandon his
children, and neither will you.
RICK
God doesn't pay day-care.
MOTHER
There are other things out there...
less expensive ways.
RICK
Could you watch them?
MOTHER
Oh... uh... well... I don't think
your father is willing to do that.
We raised our kids, Rick.
RICK
How `bout tonight, so I can catch a
breath?
MOTHER
What? My watching them while you
were in there with Phillip wasn't
enough? Make me feel guilty.
RICK
I'll just ask God to watch them. He
never abandons his children.
44.
Rick's mom reaches in her purse and pulls some bills from her
wallet.
MOTHER
Take this.
RICK
I don't want your money mom.
MOTHER
Take the money.
As Rick puts the money in his pocket he finds the flyer.
CUT TO:
Rick flees on foot. The Woman gives chase.
CUT TO:
52.
Rick jumps into his car, locking the doors behind him. Woman
tugs at the door handle as he drives away.
CUT TO:
Rick and WOMAN 3 are engaged in a deep kiss. They fumble
through the door.
CUT TO:
The woman, wrapped in sheets, runs down the street. Rick gets
to the door and catches himself in the jamb.
RICK
(Calling out)
Was it something I said?
CUT TO:
Rick walks against the flow of the CROWD. As if in a dream,
everywhere he looks he sees Melanie. Every woman has her
face.
CUT TO:
Melanie, Rick and the boys fly a kite on a summer's day.
CUT TO:
Cindy closes the car door.
CINDY
Thank you.
RICK
Three hours.
CINDY
They'll be here.
Rick's POV: He watches Cindy back out and leave.
CUT TO:
Dressed as dirty paupers, Rick and the boys hold tin cups out
to the PASSING BY.
CUT TO:
A PEDESTRIAN drops a coin in ricks coffer.
PEDESTRIAN
You poor, poor man. You poor, poor
children. How unfortunate to only
have your father. How terrible it
must be not to know your mother.
CUT TO:
Against a burning sky, Rick waits in the drive. Cindy
arrives. Her hair is strewed. The boys pile out of the car
and gather round their mommy. She kneels to their level.
KRIS
When can we see you again?
CINDY
Someday.
PHILLIP
Is someday tomorrow?
CINDY
Someday is someday, baby.
RICK
Give your Mom a hug, guys, then get
in the house.
The boys hug their mom and then run to the door. A tear wells
in Cindy's eye.
CINDY
I'm sorry.
RICK
For?
CINDY
I thought things had changed.
RICK
But?
CINDY
I am who I am, Rick. I'm not cut
out to be a mommy.
69.
RICK
I could have told you that.
CINDY
I had to give it a shot. Rick turns
to walk away.
Rick's POV: Sees the boys looking out the door. Rick turns
back around to Cindy.
RICK
At whose expense? Huh, Cindy? At
whose expense? Who's going to dry
their tears tomorrow when they
realize your never coming back?
Who's going to rock them to sleep
at night when they ask why mommy
doesn't love them?
CINDY
You are, and you wouldn't have it
any other way.
A furious PULL BACK
CUT TO:
The boys are loaded in a wagon and pulled away from Rick by
an unrecognizable COUPLE. A small, hand-painted, sign that
hangs from the back of the wagon reads: BON VOYAGE. From
Rick's POV: The boys move further and further away. Kris
tries to christen the wagon with plastic bottled water. From
the boy's POV: Their waving father fades in the distance.
CUT TO:
Rick sits at the picnic table reading a book. The boys are
off playing. Kris falls. He grabs his knee and cries. Rick
drops his book and runs to the child. GUARDS on duty pay no
attention. Rick reaches the child. The injury appears rather
serious.
RICK
(Calling out.)
Can I get some help here.
His calls go unanswered.
A tear forms in his eyes. Months of frustration boil in his
face. A CONVICT passing by kneels by Rick.
RICK
Can you help me?
CONVICT
Can you help him?
RICK
I don't know.
CONVICT
What does he need?
RICK
I don't know.
CONVICT
He needs a father, not a book
reading baby-sitter.
RICK
(In a hushed rage)
I can't fucking do this.
CONVICT
Yes you can.
75.
The convict runs his hand over the child's leg and everything
appears healed.
CONVICT
Use your mind and your heart. It's
different than it ever should have
been... but different isn't wrong.
RICK
But I...
CONVICT
Use what you have. There is a vein
of wealth inside you just waiting
to be mined. Think differently than
you have ever thought before.
Worker harder than you ever thought
you could. Love these children like
they've never been loved before.
RICK
How?
CONVICT
The answer lies within. Quit
worrying about how these misguided
events have torn your life apart.
Quit dwelling on all of your
misgivings. Look around you. You're
not alone. But you, and you alone,
will make the difference.
CUT TO:
Rick and his mother walk along.
RICK
Mom, I have an idea, but I need
your help.
Rick's mom reaches in her purse.
RICK
Put your checkbook away. What I
need you can't buy.
MOTHER
What do you need.
RICK
For you to believe in me.
CUT TO:
Rick, his parents and the boys pound a sign into the front
yard that reads: "MOW `EM AND GROW `EM LAWN CARE 555-1616"
CUT TO:
79.
Rick and the boys stand by the river looking up a huge
embankment. There appears to be no permanent trail. Looking
up, scattered PEOPLE sit at different levels on the climb.
RICK
Well, guys, I guess this is it.
KRIS
We can do it daddy.
RICK
Yes we can.
Rick stretches out. The boys jog in place. Rick cracks his
neck. The boys crack their knuckles. In SLOW MOTION they
begin their ascent, running wildly up the incline. Rick falls
flat on his face. The boys all trip over him, leaving them
all in a pile. Rick bounces up and dusts himself off. The
boys do the same and away they go.
CUT TO:
Rick and the boys are on their hands and knees with hand
trimmers snipping away at the lawn.
CUT TO:
Rick caries the boys. Phillip is draped across his shoulder.
Nicholas hangs around his neck. Kris clings to Rick's leg and
is dragged with each step. They pass a weary CLIMBER who has
taken a moment to catch his breath.
CLIMBER
You can do it.
RICK
Yes we can.
CUT TO:
Rick is using a push mower on this huge estate. Nicholas
follows behind with a bubble mower.
CUT TO:
82.
The boys are dragging Rick up the hill.
CUT TO:
Rick and the boys are crowded onto the seat of a large
commercial mower.
CUT TO:
The boys' do a victory dance at the top of the hill, their
arms extended far above their heads. Kris stops for a moment
and then tugs at his father's shirt. Rick tries to ignore the
child but then stops mid-dance.
RICK
What is it, Kris?
Kris points up.
KRIS
Look daddy.
CUT TO:
Rick holds a college pamphlet. Rick's POV: He looks at the
pamphlet then up to see they aren't even close to the top.
They have just reached a plateau along the way.
PHILLIP
We can do it.
RICK
(Through a weary voice.)
Yes we can.
CUT TO:
83.
Rick and the boys continue their climb. The breaths are
heavy, but they march steadily upward.
CUT TO:
Rick and the boys, hand in hand, walk toward the church.
CUT TO:
Rick and the boys stop to rest. Kris throws a rock while Rick
is looking away. Rick looks up to find Phillip picking up a
stone.
RICK
Put the stone down.
PHILLIP
But...
RICK
No buts: Put the stone down.
Off Screen SFX: A huge thud and someone rolling down the
hill.
RICK
I knew this was a hard climb,
but...
A RESTING CLIMBER appears.
RESTING CLIMBER
Long way up.
RICK
Yeah.
RESTING CLIMBER
Long way down for that matter.
RICK
That too.
A beat.
85.
RICK
So, what's your point.
RESTING CLIMBER
No point, just an observation.
Drink?
The climber holds out a canteen.
RICK
I'm okay.
RESTING CLIMBER
For the boys.
NICHOLAS
Daddy, I'm thirsty. Rick studies
the climber for a moment.
RICK
Go ahead.
The climber hands the boys the canteen.
RESTING CLIMBER
You know, if you stop here, halfway
between a long way up and a long
way down you really haven't
accomplished much, have you?
RICK
We're not stopping. We're just
resting.
RESTING CLIMBER
That's what I said, fourteen years
ago. Rick looks toward the top.
RICK
We can do this.
RESTING CLIMBER
Yes you can.
A reinvigorated Rick hops to his feet.
RICK
We can do this!
BOYS IN UNISON
Yes we can!
CUT TO:
86.
In B&W; SLO-MO: Rick stands watching his sons play. The wind
blows the leaves of a tree. The boys run further and further
out until they are out of sight. Rick calls out to them.
Slowly, across the field, three young adults return. Rick is
now an old man, hunched over and aged with wrinkles. The
three young men walk beside their elderly father, supporting
him with each step.
CUT TO:
Rick is holding flowers. The boys have an assortment of
"instruments" to add a serenade. The music is a mishmash of
odd notes that could only be construed as music to a parent's
ear. Melanie stands on the front porch, her arms crossed.
MELANIE
What do you want?
RICK
I'm a proud man, sometimes foolish.
88.
MELANIE
Go on.
RICK
I have a long way to go before I
could ever be the man you need me
to be.
MELANIE
And?
RICK
And I got confused between what I
should have done and what I thought
was right.
MELANIE
Yes you did.
RICK
I put you on a pedestal and then I
knocked you down. It wasn't fair.
MELANIE
Life's not fair Rick.
RICK
You were more a mother to my boys
than they have ever known. You were
more a woman to me than I have ever
deserved.
MELANIE
You're right.
RICK
You're not going to make this easy,
are you?
MELANIE
Cut the bullshit, Rick.
Rick wraps his arms around Melanie and pulls her in for a
hug.
RICK
(In Mel's ear)
I can live my life alone. I can
raise my kids alone. I can walk
this path alone. I'd much rather do
it with you.
89.
Grabbing him by the collar she's torn. Melanie shakes her
head.
MELANIE
I can't.
She turns to go inside.
RICK
Can't?
MELANIE
(Turning back around.)
I won't.
RICK
I shouldn't have come here.
MELANIE
No, you shouldn't have.
Rick turns to leave.
MELANIE
You just don't get it do you?
RICK
Get what?
MELANIE
You're here for you, you selfish
prick.
CUT TO:
Rick falls flat on his face. He lays there motionless.
PHILLIP
Don't quit, daddy.
Rick pounds the ground, pulls himself up, dusts himself off
and with a determined look starts back up the hill.
KRIS
Daddy doesn't quit.
CUT TO:
Rick comes to another plateau and finds Melanie waiting for
him.
MELANIE
I never thought you'd make it.
RICK
Been waiting long?
MELANIE
I never thought you'd find me.
RICK
I had to find me first. I hope you
plan on walking, cause I'm not sure
I can carry you.
MELANIE
So, how do we do this? The two
begin the ascent together.
RICK
One step at a time?
MELANIE
Side by side?
RICK
Maybe you could carry me?
Rick jumps in Melanie's arms. They tumble to the ground under
his weight.
CUT TO:
