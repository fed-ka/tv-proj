  Batiatus strides across the Mess Hall, which is empty except 
  for a few SLAVES preparing porridge. He glances out into

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  where 50 of his hardened GLADIATORS are finishing up another 
  day of punishing training. DOCTORE coils his whip as they 
  break off for food and the baths.

  A GUARD

  intercepts Batiatus with a SCROLL.

                                        GUARD
                        Dominus.

  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus takes it with a frown -- which brightens as he 
  quickly scans the scroll.  He hustles for the GATE 
  separating the Mess Hall from the stairs leading up to the 
  villa. ANOTHER GUARD opens it for him, closing it as he 
  disappears up the stairs.

  GLADIATORS

  move into the Mess Hall, laughing and shoving, their bodies 
  WIPING US TO --



  The harsh sun of Capua blazes in the sky.  Spartacus and SIX 
  RECRUITS are lined up for inspection in the center of the 
  square, bare chests glistening in the heat.  Spartacus finds 
  himself next to VARRO,

  a handsome young slab of beef.  Varro stands out among the 
  slave recruits, intelligence and pride shining in his eyes.

  A HUNDRED MEN

  ring the square.  Hard.  Cruel.  Gladiators.  They laugh and 
  point, indicating the obvious shortcomings of the Recruits.

                                        ASHUR
                        Pile of shit.  Not a cock among 
                        them.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You should join them, then, you 
                        little cunt.

  Barca laughs.  Ashur chuckles good-naturedly, but we see in 
  his eyes a venom for Crixus.

  DOCTORE,

  the trainer, strides up with whip in hand.  Powerful and 
  commanding, the harsh Capuan sun deepening the VALLEY OF 
  SCARS marring half his imposing face. The Gladiators 
    respectfully quiet.  Doctore pins the Recruits with an iron 
  gaze.

                                          DOCTORE
                        What is beneath your feet?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.
  CONTINUED:

  The Recruits glance down in confusion at the sand.  All 
  except Spartacus, who holds his gaze on Doctore.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Answer!  What is beneath your feet?

  KERZA (Recruit #1), thuggish and not overly bright, 
  tentatively replies.

                                        KERZA
                        Sand?

  The Gladiators chuckle, knowing what s coming.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Crixus!  What is beneath your feet?

                                          DOCTORE

                        Your tears.  Your blood.  Your 
                        pathetic lives, forged into 
                        something of worth.  Turn your eyes 
                        from your gods and fix them upon 
                        me.  Listen.  Learn.  And perhaps, 
                        live.  As gladiators.  Now, attend 
                        your master!

  Doctore indicates

  THE BALCONY

  where Batiatus now stands with Lucretia, Naevia, and a few 
  attending slaves.

                                        BATIATUS

                        purveyor of gladiators in all the 
                        Republic!

  The Gladiators cheer and laugh, proud of the heritage.

                        love or history.  Succeed, and 
                        stand proud among my titans!

  The Gladiators roar their approval.  Spartacus takes them in 
  with contempt and hatred.  Batiatus motions for Doctore to 
  continue.  Doctore CRACKS HIS WHIP, silencing the uproar.  
  He surveys the Recruits with dissatisfaction.

                                          DOCTORE
                        A Gladiator does not fear death.  
                      He embraces it.  Caresses it.  
                        Fucks it.

  The Gladiators chuckle.  Kerza the Recruit joins in.  
  Doctore zeroes in on him.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Each time he enters the arena, he 
                        slips his cock into the mouth of 
                        the beast.  And prays to thrust 
                        home before the jaws snap shut.

  Doctore whacks Kerza in the crotch with his coiled whip. 
  Kerza grunts, dropping to the ground.  The Gladiators laugh, 
  as does Batiatus on the balcony, enjoying the show.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        None of you stray dogs would last a 
                        fleeting moment.  Except for one...

  His eyes fall on Spartacus.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        This sad, battered Thracian stood 
                        against four in the arena.  
                        Condemned to die, given nothing but 
                        a sword to wager his life upon.  
                        They came at him!

  We SMASH to Spartacus in the arena, fighting the four 
  Gladiators from episode 101 (conveniently already shot).



  Spartacus is surrounded by the four Gladiators: Murmillo, 
  Retiarius, Secutor, and Hoplomachus. The Hoplomachus thrusts 
  his spear out. Spartacus SNAPS his head out of the way, 
  SWEAT erupting from the force.                                                                                    12.



                                          DOCTORE
                        Again and again and again!

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  Quick FLASHES as the Gladiators assault Spartacus. * The 
  Retiarius sweeps in with his net, catching Spartacus  foot 
  and yanking him to the ground. * The Hoplomachus swings his 
  spear, the arc of the tip OPENING A GASH across The 
  Thracian s back. * The Murmillo slams into Spartacus with 
  his shield, sending him flying back in a spray of blood.



                                          DOCTORE
                        The day was lost. But not for the 
                        Thracian! He refused Death! Fate! 
                        The gods themselves!

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  Quick FLASHES of Spartacus  bloody victory against his four 
  opponents. * Spartacus rips the side of the Murmillo open in 
  a SPRAY OF BLOOD and INTERNAL ORGANS. * Spartacus SEVERS THE 
  LEGS out from under the Retiarius. * Spartacus slams his 
  sword up through the head of the Secutor.



  The Recruits gawk at Spartacus. Varro grins in admiration.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Gaze at this man! Study him. And 
                        realize... he is nothing.

  Spartacus locks eyes with Doctore.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        A coward. A deserter from the 
                        Auxiliary. A frightened little 
                        rabbit.

  Kerza snickers, favoring his throbbing crotch.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

                        And his victory in the arena? As 
                        hollow as his courage. He fought 
                        against the ill-trained men of 
                        Solonius, your master s rival.

  Doctore spits in disgust. Batiatus laughs in agreement.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A mockery! Had Spartacus entered 
                        the arena with any Gladiator among 
                        these ranks, his head would have 
                        left well in advance of his body!

  The Gladiators laugh, cheering their agreement. Spartacus 
  glances up at Batiatus. Challenging. Defiant.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The Thracian disagrees. A 
                          demonstration, perhaps?

  Batiatus waves his permission.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Crixus!

  Crixus grins, taking his place front and center. He s going 
  to enjoy this. Doctore barks an order to Pietros.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Practice swords.

  Pietros grabs two WOODEN SWORDS from a rack of WEAPONS, 
  hustles over. He gives one to Crixus, the other to Doctore. 
  Doctore tosses the sword at Spartacus  feet.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Prove us wrong, Spartacus.

  Spartacus glares, then looks away. Doctore uncoils his whip.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Pick it up.

  Spartacus ignores him.

                        Spartacus!

  Doctore rears back with his whip. TIME SLOWS as the leather 
  CONTRAILS through the air. TIME RESUMES as Spartacus throws 
  his arm up at the last second -- not to defend himself, but 
  to catch it as it snaps around his wrist. BLOOD RISES

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.
  CONTINUED:

  as the leather digs into Spartacus  flesh. Veins start from 
  muscles. Spartacus glares at Doctore.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        That is not my name.

                        Your name -- your life -- is what 
                      we decide.

  Doctore suddenly yanks the whip. TIME SLOWS as Spartacus is 
  lifted from his feet. TIME RESUMES, crashing Spartacus to 
  the sand by the wooden sword.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Pick it up.

  A beat. Spartacus stands, kicking the practice sword aside 
  in defiance. Varro frowns. Not a smart move. Doctore snorts.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Perhaps the coward requires 
                        advantage to still his trembling 
                        knees.
                                to Pietros)(
                        Gladius!

  Pietros grabs a REAL SWORD from the rack, hands it to 
  Doctore. Doctore tosses it to land several lengths in front 
  of Spartacus. He glances at it... and looks away. Doctore 
  laughs in disappointment, turns to Batiatus on the balcony.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        I can do nothing with this one. 
                        Send him to the mines --

  Spartacus suddenly dives. TIME SLOWS and ACCELERATES as he 
  snatches the gladius up, rolls to his feet, and swings at 
  Doctore.

  CRIXUS INTERCEPTS,

  deflecting the blow with his practice sword. Crixus grins.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Feeling rested, are we?

  Crixus kicks him back. Spartacus stumbles, nearly loses his 
  footing. He regains it just as Crixus attacks. He s a marvel 
  of speed and grace, every movement a brutal poem. Doctore 
  circles, pointing out Spartacus  deficiencies for the 
  recruits.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

                      An attack must be grounded in 
                        proper footing. He attempts to 
                        press before regaining balance.

  Spartacus snarls, swinging savagely. Against a normal 
  opponent the tactic would ensure victory. Crixus avoids each 
  blow, the gladius WHISTLING inches from his flesh.

  CRIXUS SIDESTEPS,

  spinning to catch Spartacus in the back of the knee. 
  Spartacus goes down with a grunt of pain. The Gladiators 
  roar. Crixus laughs, enjoying the lesson.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Allow advantage to your back... and 
                        you are dead.

  Spartacus staggers to his feet and attacks. He drives Crixus 
  back with his fury. Crixus catches Spartacus  sword arm in 
  mid blow with his free hand, Spartacus the same. A test of 
  strength ensues, muscles straining in the sun.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Become entangled with a more 
                        powerful opponent...

  Crixus grins, then TOSSES Spartacus. Spartacus lands hard, 
  eats sand.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        ...and you are dead.

  Spartacus grits his teeth in rage. He rolls to his feet and 
  HURLS his sword.

  LUCRETIA

  gasps as TIME SLOWS, the blade rotating through the air at 
  Crixus.

  CRIXUS

  catches a GLINT OF SUNLIGHT reflecting from the blade out of 
  the corner of his eye. TIME RESUMES as he whirls around and

  DEFLECTS THE GLADIUS

  with his sword, sending the deadly projectile SLAMMING into

                        you are dead. Again.

  The Gladiators howl. Spartacus, enraged, rushes Crixus. 
  Crixus spins and cracks Spartacus in the back of the head, 
  sending him crashing once more to the sand. Crixus plants a 
  foot on Spartacus  back, pinning him face down. Spartacus 
  struggles, can t break free.

  Doctore holds up his index and middle finger, slightly bent.

  Spartacus glares, face bloodied and bruised. Spartacus  hand

  in disgust.

                        Crixus!

  Crixus pauses, looking up. Batiatus waves him off. Crixus 
  bows slightly in deference and respect, stepping away from 
  Spartacus.

  Doctore nods in submission. He motions to Varro and Kerza to 
  help Spartacus up. He shakes them off, glaring at Doctore as 
  he resumes his place in line.

  THE BALCONY

  Lucretia eyes Batiatus, anger rising in her cheeks.

                        Glaber visits tomorrow. His 
                        intention towards the Thracian may 
                        include blood. Until his patronage 
                      is secured, I ll keep it warm and 
                        flowing.

  He glances up at the blazing sun.

  He moves off into the shade of his villa. Lucretia lingers, 
  her eyes falling on

  CRIXUS

  in the square below. He catches the look, his eyes 
  twinkling. She barely suppresses a lustful smile. Definitely 
  more to this relationship than simple master and slave. 
  Lucretia heads into the villa with Naevia, the flutter of 
  her dress WIPING US TO --



  A SERIES OF SHOTS as Spartacus, Varro, and the Recruits are

  cracks his whip.  Blows are exchanged with wooden swords and

  RECRUIT #3 across the face with his shield.  BLOOD SPLATTERS

  The MOON bathes the square in silver.  Even at night, the 
  temperature is sweltering.

  SPARTACUS

  and the Recruits slowly plod through the sand, marching a 
    never-ending circle as they carry HEAVY LOG SECTIONS across 
  their shoulders.  Spartacus slows, legs straining and sweat 
  starting from slick, trembling muscles.

  DOCTORE S WHIP LASHES OUT,

  raising a bloody welt across Spartacus  back.

  Spartacus grits his teeth against the pain, continues on.

  A NAKED BATIATUS

  watching from the ludus balcony.  He sips a cup of wine, 
  worry etching his face.

  LUCRETIA

  joins him, wearing a gauzy sleeping gown.  Half awake, just 
  roused from slumber.

  She smiles dreamily, taking the cup of wine from his hand.

                      In a moment.

  She sips, frowns.

  Her hand strokes the back of his head.  A familiar gesture 
  of love and affection.  He smiles absently, taking strength 
  from it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The arrangements are set?

  takes a breath, exhales as he casts his eyes heavenward.

  Spartacus and the Recruits still march with the logs across

  Lucretia looks out across the square.  Doctore puts the

  CRIXUS

  and the senior Gladiators train apart from them.  Muscles 
  and sweat gleaming with temptation.  Ilithyia steps out next 
  to Lucretia, eyes wide at the sight.

  The subject is a painful one.  Lucretia tries to hide the

  Glaber appears with Batiatus, breaking the awkward moment.

  He s tried his best.

  Glaber sweeps out.  Ilithyia pouts, surprises Lucretia with 
  a quick peck on the cheek before following Glaber.

                        Perhaps you should have sacrificed 
                        two rams.

  Batiatus fumes, heading after his honored guests.  Lucretia 
  turns back to the

  TRAINING SQUARE,

  a scorching breeze adding to her displeasure.  She squints 
  against the unforgiving sun, her eyes falling on

  SPARTACUS

  as he s led back out by the Guards.  The rage of his 
  emotions has left him drained.  Empty.

  DOCTORE

  studies him, noting the shift.  There is no judgement in his 
  eyes.  No malice.  Merely the gathering of information.

  Kerza grins at the sight of his opponent, relishing the

                        Yes, Doctore.

  Varro sees the state of Spartacus, frowns with concern. 
  Kerza picks up another wooden sword and tosses it to 
  Spartacus.  Spartacus snatches it out of the air just before 
  it slams into him, revealing

  SURA S BINDING

  wrapped loosely around his hand.  He looks to Kerza. 
    Dispassionate.  Barely registering the man.

  The rest of the Recruits stop sparring, wiping the sweat

  Kerza unleashes a quick series of practiced moves.  
  Spartacus counters, barely fending off the assault.  He 
  stumbles back, nearly falls.

  BARCA LAUGHS,

  nudging Crixus to alert him the Thracian is about to get his 
  ass handed to him again.  The rest of the senior Gladiators 
  take notice.  Ashur watches with particular interest.

                        Form two.  Attack!

  Kerza unleashes another volley.  Spartacus counters, eyes 
  narrowing to the task -- until they are pulled from the mark 
  at the sight of GLABER

  exiting with Ilithyia, Batiatus following in their wake.  
  TIME SLOWS.  PUSH IN on Spartacus, the sounds of the world 
  fading, his own breath filling his ears.

  ON SPARTACUS,

  longing to strip the flesh from the Roman.  CRACK!  TIME 
  RESUMES as Kerza s wooden sword catches Spartacus across the 
  face, drawing blood.

  SPARTACUS SNAPS,

  his lips twisting into a snarl as he rushes Kerza, slamming 
  him to the ground.  BLOOD SPRAYS from Kerza s mouth and nose 
  as Spartacus  fists rain down on him.  The Recruits and 
  Gladiators explode, shouting encouragement.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Spartacus!

  Spartacus ignores him, his eyes wild.  Sura s binding 
  partially UNRAVELS from around his hand, fluttering amidst 
  the violence.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Spartacus!

  Doctore unleashes his whip.  TIME SLOWS as it CONTRAILS 
  through the air, LASHING AROUND SPARTACUS  NECK and yanking 
  him back.

  SURA S BINDING

  flies from his hand as he crashes to the sand.  He 
  desperately reaches for it, but the Guards are on him with 
  their clubs.  His hand almost reclaims the binding despite 
  the blows, but

  A GUST OF WIND

  carries it beyond his reach.  It writhes across the sand 
  like a cloth serpent, its purple coils WIPING US TO --



  The fighting men of the ludus yell encouragement and insults 
  at

  VARRO

  who is trading thunderous blows with GNAEUS, one of the 
  senior Gladiators.  Real swords.  Real shields.  No helmets. 
  The battle rages atop a

  TESTING BRIDGE

  that has been erected in the center of the training square. 
  Six feet off the ground, twenty feet long, no rails, a ramp 
  on either side.  Gnaeus is largely unscathed. Varro grits 
  his teeth, bloodied and exhausted but refusing to give in.

  THE SENIOR GLADIATORS

  urge the combatants on as we ROTATE AROUND the bridge, 
  torches ringing the scene to illuminate the night.  Doctore 
  stalks, his eyes dissecting every stroke and counter for 
  future reference.

  SPARTACUS

  stands with Kerza and the other Recruits, waiting his turn 
  on the bridge.  Spartacus  face is unreadable.  Distant.  
  Haunted.  Continue rotating around to reveal

  BATIATUS

  watching from the balcony with Lucretia, Naevia, and other 
  privileged Slaves.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Cease!  Varro has stood to a draw!  
                        The test is passed!

  The Gladiators roar their approval.  Varro beams.  Gnaeus 
  greets him as a brother as they descend the ramp.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Barca!  Marcus!  Positions!

  Barca climbs the ramp.  Marcus, aka Recruit #4, mirrors on 
  the opposing side.  Sweat drips from his nervous face.  He 
  grips his sword, steeling himself for battle.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  Marcus lets loose a bloodcurdling cry as he attacks.  Barca 
  counters in one smooth motion and cracks Marcus in the 
  skull.  Marcus tumbles from the bridge, landing at 
  Spartacus  feet in a spray of blood.  Dead before he hit the 
  ground.

  THE GLADIATORS ROAR

  with laughter, delighted in the unexpectedly quick demise.

                                        LUCRETIA
                          Disappointing.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Not every venture ends in climax.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        A fact known to every woman.

  Batiatus scowls at the comment as Doctore calls for the next 
  combatants.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Crixus!  Spartacus!  Positions!

  Spartacus steps over Marcus  body as he takes his place on 
  the bridge.  Crixus grins from the other side, eyeing the 
  Thracian like a meal to be devoured.

                                        CRIXUS
                        A final lesson, before I send you 
                      to the afterlife.

  Spartacus, lost in thought, doesn t meet his gaze.  Varro 
  notes this with concern.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

                        Begin!

  Crixus braces himself for the usual wild Thracian assault.  
  It doesn t come.  Spartacus stands motionless, seeing the 
  world through the haze of a heavy heart.  The Gladiators 
  murmur disapproval.  Varro sags.

                                        VARRO
                                  soft)(
                        Fuck.

  The Gladiators begin to laugh and catcall.  Ashur yells out, 
  his wager against Crixus in serious jeopardy.

                                        ASHUR
                        Fight!  Fight, you Thracian bitch!

  Spartacus ignores him, his eyes dropping to SURA S BINDING 
  clutched in his shield hand.  FLASH TO --



  Sura stands naked in the clearing by the persimmon tree.  
  Perfect, golden, her hair fluttering in the warm breeze of 
  home, the PURPLE BINDING tied to her thigh.  A faint, sad 
  smile bends her lips.



  Spartacus closes his eyes, a tear creasing his dirty cheek. 
  Crixus laughs.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Tears!  The rabbit is fixed to piss 
                        himself!

  Lucretia glares at Spartacus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Expensive.  And worthless, all in a 
                        measure.

  Batiatus sighs.  Doctore was right.  The Thracian is 
  uncontrollable.  Batiatus motions for Crixus to attack and 
  end it.






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

  TIME SLOWS

  as Crixus rushes forward, sword rearing back for the death 
  blow.  Spartacus releases Sura s binding.  As it hits the 
  floor of the bridge TIME RESUMES.

  SPARTACUS DEFLECTS

  Crixus  attack at the last second, his eyes snapping open 
  with deadly focus.  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES as they trade 
  blows worthy of the gods.

  THE GLADIATORS ROAR

  their approval.  Varro futilely attempts to keep his hopes 
  in check as Spartacus whirls and attacks.

  LUCRETIA TENSES

  as Crixus nearly tumbles off the bridge from the assault.  
  He regains his balance and counters, hammering Spartacus 
  with practiced brutality.

  SPARTACUS  SHIELD

  is knocked from his grasp.  Crixus presses, spins, smashes 
  Spartacus with his own shield.  BLOOD SPRAYS from Spartacus  
  mouth as he crashes to the floor of the bridge, stunned, his 
  blade falling from his hand.  Crixus looks to

  BATIATUS

  for approval to finish Spartacus once and for all.  Batiatus 
  hisses condemnation for Spartacus  entire race.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Thracians.

  He waves Crixus on to the matter.  Crixus grins, rearing his 
  sword back to cleave Spartacus  head open.  TIME SLOWS.  
  Through the blood dripping in his eyes Spartacus spots

  SURA S BINDING

  on the floor -- and Crixus  foot half upon it.  TIME RESUMES 
  as Crixus brings his weapon to bear.  Spartacus rolls out of 
  its path and grabs the end of Sura s binding, yanking with 
  all his strength.

  CRIXUS FLIES FROM HIS FEET,

  cracking his head as he tumbles from the bridge.  He hits 
  the sand hard, dazed, struggling toward his senses.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

  LUCRETIA

  presses forward, her breath catching.

  SPARTACUS

  grabs his fallen sword and leaps down, Sura s binding 
  fluttering in his hand.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The lesson is well learned.

  He rears back with an enraged snarl, intent on having the 
  Gaul s head.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus!

  Spartacus reacts to his new name for the first time.  He 
  pauses in his grim work, throwing Batiatus a wild look.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You have passed the test.  Stand 
                        down.

  A tense beat.  Lucretia s knuckles go white from gripping 
  the balcony.  Spartacus calms, lowering his sword -- and his 
  eyes -- in deference to Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Dominus.

  There is no venom in the word.  Merely acceptance.  Lucretia 
  remembers to breathe.  Batiatus smiles in satisfaction.  The 
  beast has been tamed.  The Gladiators roar. Ashur shouts in 
  triumph as Barca and Gnaeus rush to help Crixus.  Varro 
  grins in relief, rushing to Spartacus  side.

  PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS

  through the chaos, his eyes reflecting the choice he has 
  just made.  Hardship.  Slavery.  The arena.  All for Sura.  
  CONTINUE FORWARD, PUSHING INTO SPARTACUS  EYE as the tip of

  A RED-HOT BRAND

  bearing the MARK OF BATIATUS appears, TRANSITIONING US TO --



  Batiatus presses the brand into Varro s shoulder.  Varro 
  grunts as his flesh SIZZLES.  The Gladiators looking on 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

  CHEER as he joins Kerza, also freshly branded.  Batiatus 
  turns to

  SPARTACUS,

  standing alone, the moon huge behind him over the mountains. 
  Batiatus returns the brand to the fire, heating it to 
  purpose.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus.  Come forward.

  Spartacus complies.  Crixus, a cut creasing his brow from 
  his fall, attempts to glare the flesh from the Thracian s 
  bones.  Ashur catches the look, suppresses a satisfied 
  smile.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You have taken a small stride 
                        towards greater glory.  Your life 
                        now promises meaning.  Swear it to 
                        me.  Recite the Sacramentum 
                        Gladiatorum, and stand among my 
                        titans.

  Batiatus nods to Doctore, who steps forward.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Speak as I speak, and receive your 
                        mark.  I commit my flesh.  My mind.  
                      My will. 

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I commit my flesh.  My mind.  My 
                        will.

  LUCRETIA

  watches from the balcony with Naevia.  She turns away and 
  exits inside, having seen enough of the man that caused her 
  favored Crixus embarrassment.

                                          DOCTORE
                         To the glory of this ludus, and

  CLOSE ON SPARTACUS  HAND

  as it clenches around Sura s binding, muscles rippling with 
  the strength gained from it.

                        pursuit of honor in the arena. 

  Spartacus  eyes harden into deadly resolve.

  Batiatus retrieves his brand, the tip once again glowing 
  red. His eyes dance with the possibility of Spartacus  
  future achievements in the arena.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Welcome to the brotherhood.

  Batiatus presses the brand into Spartacus  shoulder. 
  Everything FADES except the searing mark left in Spartacus  
  flesh.  It hangs on the SCREEN for a moment.  An angry, 
  wrathful thing.


  BLACKOUT.
