tears. - .they hug.
Micky crying into her shoulder and hair, Charlene holding
onto him, she backs him into his BEDROOM, the fall to the
bed, kissing. FADE OUT -
81 FADE IN - MICKY'S BEDROOM - EARLY NEXT MORNING 81
Next morning. Micky's hands grab dingy white boxing wraps
out of the darkness of his messy closet, faded red gloves,
throws them into an old blue gym bag, leaves. Charlene sits
up in bed, groggy, gets up in Micky's t-shirt, goes out.
81A STAIRS - MICKY'S APARTMENT ABOVE GARAGE - EARLY MORNING 81A
Micky stands at the top of the stairs, old blue gym bag slung
over his shoulder, early morning. He looks out at morning...
All eyes watch Micky messed up now -- Charlene, O'Keefe,
George, Alice, Little Dicky, others. He steps back into the
ring with O'Keefe.
O'Keefe looks unsure as he holds the mits. Micky's about to
throw when O'Keefe turns, looks.

Dicky walks back into the gym as Micky is about to work out
with O'Keefe.
ALICE
What happened?
DICKY
He says I can't work with him.
ALICE
That's not right. [Dicky starts to
leave] He never woulda won Sanchez
without me!
MICKEY O'KEEFE
That's fuckin' bullshit! Take that
back!
DICKY
Don't talk to my mother my mother
like that.
ALICE
Why don't you ask Micky?
MICKEY O'KEEFE
They gotta go. If we're gonna
train.
CHARLENE
They have to go, Micky.
ALICE
Why don't you ask Micky if he
woulda won Sanchez without Dicky?
Ask him.
They all look at Micky. He is torn up over this as he
considers it before he speaks and they all watch, tense.
MICKY
I wouldn'ta won Sanchez without
Dicky.
CHARLENE
How can you say that to O'Keefe?
MICKY
Because it's true. I went in with
our plan and it wasn't working, I
switched to what I learned with
Dicky.
Micky looks at O'Keefe, who is hurt.

DICKY
Fuck you, Charlene, I'm 8 months
sober.
CHARLENE
I'm sure you'll need somethin' for
your back now that you're out.
DICKY
O'Keefe's in the same boat I am,
one day at a time, why's it all
right for him to be here, but not
me? I'm blood.
MICKY
I'm the one fighting, not you, not
you, and not YOU. I know what I
need.
CHARLENE
(GETS SHRILL)
And you need Dicky?
Micky roils as he makes this decision.
MICKY
I want Dicky back. And I want you,
Charlene, and I want O'Keefe, and
my family.
CHARLENE
You can't do that to us.
MICKY
You sound like them now.
CHARLENE
Maybe you're just like them and
that's where you belong.
She looks at him, turns and walks out of the gym, followed by
O'Keefe, who looks sadly back at Micky.
ALICE
Everything happens for a reason,
this could be for the best, honey.
Micky watches Dicky get geared up with gloves, headgear,
mouth guard by Art Ramalho. ANOTHER BOXER gears up Micky.

Alice, take him home. [Little Alice
leaves with Little Dicky]. What're
you doin', Micky? What's the
matter with you!
MICKY
Can this be my fight, for once,
Alice, huh, just once, maybe just
this one time, not for Dicky? I
know you think he's comin' back,
he's 40 years old and doesn't have
a tooth in his head that's his own--
DICKY
(GETTING UP)
I can go ten more rounds, let's go-
ALICE
Let your brother talk.
DICKY

Neary, how ya gonna work me?
MICKY
Shut up!
DICKY
Shea Neary --
MICKY
Shut up!
Dicky, hurt, stops.
DICKY
I'm the one who has this fight,
this is my chance for a title, and
I won't get another one after this.
Am I being selfish? Am I saying
Micky, Micky, Micky? I'm sorry, I
thought I was fighting for a
championship.
He throws his gear off and starts to go when she runs to him,
embraces him.
ALICE
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't
know.

As she holds him, Micky looks frustrated, but tears up in
spite of himself and nods.
THEY HEAR WOODEN FOLDING CHAIRS THAT WERE PROPPED BY THE CAKE
