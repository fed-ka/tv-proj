      Chloe has a BIRD S EYE view of the park two hundred feet 
      below. The two hooded-figures jog past, obviously still 
      looking for our girl. One of them glances up and Chloe 
      immediately pulls back in, holding her breath.

      They didn t see her and start to move away. For the moment 
      she s safe. Chloe lets out a SIGH of relief. She turns away 
      from the railing but stops short because...

          A terrifying-looking MAN with three scars down the side of 
      his face is standing directly in front of her. 

                                  MAN
                    Good-bye, Chloe.

      She doesn t even have time to scream before he violently 
      shoves her backwards.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               2.              


      SLOW MOTION as Chloe flips back over the railing, desperately 
      grasping at nothing. The man is already gone. She catches a 
      glimpse of the ground below as...

      BACK TO REAL TIME. Chloe plummets toward the ground.



      SMACK! Chloe slams against the pavement. A WOMAN SCREAMS. 
      Several PEOPLE rush to her side.

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    She s dead.

      CONTINUALLY TIGHTEN ON CHLOE s lifeless face as BLOOD starts 
      to ooze out from under her head.

                                        ACT ONE



      The morning sun illuminates the spectacular skyline. WRITTEN 
      ACROSS the screen is... 

                                      TWO DAYS EARLIER



      Warm light hits the colorful row houses that line this San 
      Francisco street. Sun glints off of one WINDOW in particular.



      Chloe runs down the front steps and hops into the passenger 
      side of an old, beater VW BUG.



      Chloe s best friend AMY, 16, is behind the wheel. Amy, hidden 
      inside a poofy, fake-fur coat, is a vintage queen leaning 
      toward Goth, but a certain amount of innate wholesomeness 
      always manages to creep through.

                                  CHLOE
                    Go! I promised my mom I wouldn t 
                    drive with you anymore.

      Amy tries to peel out but stalls the car instead.

                                  AMY
                    You can t yell at me like that and 
                    expect me to perform. You know how 
                    I am with pressure.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sorry.

      They drive off, still lurching a little along the way.

                                  AMY
                    And that last ticket was so not my 
                    fault.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               6.              



      As the car pulls away, we catch a REFLECTION in the glass of 
      Chloe s window. It s of a MAN in a long, BLACK, LEATHER coat.     "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               7.              


      We don t see his face. But Chloe does - he seems to be 
      watching them. She quickly turns away.



      CLOSE ON a SLICE of PIZZA with a bunch of candles in it. 
      REVEAL it s being held by PAUL, 16, Chloe s other best 
      friend. Paul is tall, Asian-American, and just beginning the 
      move from Geekville to Handsometown.

                                  PAUL
                    Hurry. Make a wish! My hand s on 
                    fire.

      Chloe takes a big breath and blows out the candles.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    And now it s covered in spit. This 
                    one is definitely yours.
                          (beat)
                    What d you wish for?

                                  AMY
                    You can t tell. She can t tell.

                                  CHLOE
                    It wasn t even really... I just 
                    wished for things to be different.

                                  AMY
                    What things?

                                  CHLOE
                      Everything.

                                  AMY
                    You mean you want more than two 
                    friends.

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy. Not about you. 

      Chloe stands up on one of the wood POSTS that hold up the 
      heavy chain that separates the grass from the bike path. She 
      has a perfect view of the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Would kinda like to be kissed once 
                    in my life.

                                  PAUL
                    Hey! You ve been kissed.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               8.              


                                  CHLOE
                    We were seven.

                                  AMY
                    And clearly so traumatized by the 
                      experience it s taken her almost 
                    ten years to want to do it again.

                                  PAUL
                    And right back to  hey .

                                  CHLOE
                    I just feel like I want to take a 
                    risk. Do something... special. Be 
                    noticed. Maybe I m just tired of 
                    being the good girl.

                                  PAUL
                    Uh, how are you doing that?

      REVEAL that Chloe is balancing in the center of the CHAIN 
      strung between the posts.

                                  CHLOE
                    I don t know. It s easy. 

      She balances on one foot for a moment, showing off and hops 
      down. Paul immediately tries to duplicate the feat.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    It sounds so lame when I say it out 
                    loud, but I wanna do something 
                      dangerous. Different. Just not be 
                    me for a little while. It s hard to 
                    explain.

      After a beat.

                                  AMY
                    So do you wanna go back to my house 
                    and watch a movie?

                                  CHLOE
                    Were you not just listening to me?

                                  AMY
                    Yeah, but that s what we always do.

      OOF! Suddenly, Paul flips off the chain and lands on his back 
      between them. Ouch.

                                  PAUL
                    You re a liar. That is so not easy.
                          (beat, to Chloe)
                                  (MORE)    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               9.              

                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                    Hey, lets go to my house and play 
                    World of Warcraft. You can totally 
                    pick the realm.

      Chloe just starts to smile, mischievously.

                                  CHLOE
                    Thanks. But I ve got a better idea.



      The three of them are standing across the street from THE 
      BANK, a pulsing club that the young and beautiful are lined 
      up to get into. Amy doesn t look too sure.

                                  PAUL
                    So much better.

                                  CHLOE
                    Come on.

      They cross the street, dodging traffic, but the entrance is 
      blocked by a couple of BIG GUYS checking IDs.

                                  AMY
                    There s is no way they re letting 
                    any of us in there.

      Chloe looks down the alley that runs along the side of the 
      building. Nothing. But suddenly...

      A FRAT BOY and his GIRLFRIEND tumble out of the fire exit 
      just before Frat Boy vomits over the railing. Nice. Chloe 
      sees her chance and slips in behind them. Chloe holds the 
      door. Let s go! Now or never.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    No. Chloe. We can t--

      Paul hesitates for only a second before following after her. 

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    Wait for me.

      And she hustles up the steps.



      Chloe and Xavier come out of the club, hot and sweaty.

                                  XAVIER
                    Okay, you, my young friend, are 
                    wild.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               11.              


                                  CHLOE
                          (pleased)
                    No one s ever said that about me 
                    before.

                                  XAVIER
                    I find that hard to believe.
                          (beat)
                    You know, my brother s place is 
                    just a couple of blocks...

                                  CHLOE
                    I m not that wild. Yet.
                          (beat)
                    I really, truly, have got to go.
                          (looking around)
                    I still can t believe that Amy and 
                    Paul ditched me.

                                  XAVIER
                    Will you maybe at least call me?

      Chloe hands him her phone and he puts in his info.

                                  CHLOE
                          (off screen)
                     Xavier . I like the name.

                                  XAVIER
                    Lets hope you like the face that 
                    goes with it.

      She snaps a picture of him.

                                  CHLOE
                    I think I do. See ya.

      She starts to go but stops and glances back. Then... 

      Chloe walks up to Xavier and KISSES him. Hard. When she lets 
      go he s not quite sure what hit him and touches his lips.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    See? I knew I d been missing out.

                                  XAVIER
                    Wow. Uh, are you sure I can t at 
                    least give you a ride? It s pretty 
                    cold out.

                                  CHLOE
                    I like it. Makes me feel alive.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               12.              


      And this time she really does go, running off across the 
      street for home.

      REVEAL that our FIGURE in the long, black, leather coat is 
      watching her from the alley. We only see him from behind.

                                        ACT TWO



      A hip vintage clothing store on a bustling street.

                                  CHLOE (O.S.)
                    When did we get these in?



      Chloe is walking down the street, furiously texting.

                                  CHLOE
                          (sotto, while texting)
                    No. You have to meet me!

      She steps off the curb without looking and--

                                  BIKE MESSENGER
                    Watch out!

      A BIKE MESSENGER swerves to avoid hitting her. He skids to a 
      stop and looks back.

      But Chloe s not there. She s crouched on the roof of the car 
      next to where they should have hit.

                                  BIKE MESSENGER (CONT D)
                    How did you-- ?

      But Chloe has no idea. She s not sure how she got there 
      either, but a SMILE starts to creep across her face.



      Chloe is now sprinting down the steep, crowded street faster 
      than she could ever imagine possible as she ducks giddily 
      between people and obstacles. 

      At the last second she swerves and darts down an alley, 
      careening off the alley wall, five feet in the air.

      She races forward, jumping over trash cans, just clearing a 
      car as it pulls out in front of her. It s almost as if she s 
      flying.

      Ahead is a FIRE ESCAPE LADDER hanging down from a second 
      story. She picks up speed, leaps off of a dumpster and...

      ... just misses the ladder. She sails past and lands in a 
      pile of boxes. CRASH. There are limits. But still, it was 
      pretty cool.



      UNKNOWN WATCHER POV as the girls come out of the restaurant 
      and head up the street. They re definitely being followed.

                                  AMY
                    Okay, we need to make a plan. First- 
                    wait a day and call Bank Boy.

                                  CHLOE
                    I don t know. That was just kind of 
                      a drive-by flirting.

                                  AMY
                    Two days ago your options were zero 
                    and no one. He stays on the list. 
                    And then there s Alek.

                                  CHLOE
                    His Slavic hotness? Let it go. It s 
                    never happening.

                                  AMY
                    Before you rush to judgement, you 
                    should see him with his shirt off.
                          (off Chloe s look)
                    Fine. Then that just leaves Kitty 
                    Hat.

                                  CHLOE
                    Now he s a definite yes.

      Suddenly, Chloe grabs Amy s arm and stops. She looks back.  
      No one is there.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Sorry. I thought I heard something.

                                  AMY
                    This isn t going to become a thing, 
                    is it?
                          (beat)
                    So what do you think if the four of 
                    us went out on a double date 
                    sometime? Would it be weird?

      They stop next to Amy s car.

                                  CHLOE
                    First of all, I don t know if I ll 
                    ever see him again. And second -
                    yeah, it d be weird. But I still 
                    want to go. I really am happy for 
                    you and Paul.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               24.              


                                  AMY
                    Thanks. Me too.
                          (getting into her car)
                    And Chloe - try not to wrestle too 
                    many bad guys on your way home.

      Back to our UNKNOWN WATCHER S POV as Chloe waves and walks 
      away. She turns back one more time - but still, no one is 
      there.  She shrugs and runs off across the street.



      SMACK! Chloe lands in the middle of a sidewalk. She decides 
      which way to go for a moment, turns around and--

                                  BUM (O.S.)
                    Hey. Spare a buck?

      A fairly scary-looking BUM is right in front of her.

                                  CHLOE
                          (startled)
                    What? No. Sorry. 

                                  BUM
                    Then maybe something else.

      And he grabs her by the wrist before she can get away.

                                  CHLOE
                    HELP! Let go of me...

      They struggle and Chloe swings at him with her free hand. 
      AAAAH! The bum SCREAMS and lets go, stumbling backwards, 
      grabbing at his face.

                                  BUM
                    You bitch! What d you do to me?!

      He pulls his hand away and his face is shredded and bleeding. 
      He has four claw marks across his cheek. He immediately 
      stumbles back, trying to get away.

      Chloe looks down at her hand. She has CLAWS.


                                  END OF ACT TWO  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               25.              


                                      ACT THREE



      Chloe stands staring down at her claws. CRASH. The bum she 
      just sliced and diced stumbles back over some trash cans.

                                  BUM
                    Stay away from me.

      You don t have to tell Chloe twice.  She takes off running.



      Chloe comes to a stop in front of her house, slightly out of 
      breath, and looks at her hands. They re perfectly normal.

      But then she flexes them and the claws reappear. SHLOOSH. 
      Holy crap. There s blood on the tips. They quickly retract. 
      Chloe hurries up the front steps.



      SLAM! Chloe, with Amy s help, yanks the metal grate closed in 
      front of the store windows and starts on the padlock as Brian 
      comes up behind them

                                  BRIAN
                    You re closing early? Now how am I 
                    going to indulge my quirky headwear 
                    fetish?

                                  CHLOE
                          (sotto, to Amy)
                    Kitty Hat.
                          (to Brian)
                    Sorry. I should have warned you 
                    this happens... a lot.

                                  BRIAN
                    Just know I d planned on doing 
                    about fifteen minutes of humorous 
                    small talk before I was going to 
                    ask you this but - you wanna have a 
                    cup of coffee with me?

                                  CHLOE
                    I can t. Amy and I--

                                  AMY
                    Are parting ways because we have no 
                    plans together whatsoever. Bye.

      Amy quickly hustles off to her car. After a beat...

                                  BRIAN
                    I ll take that as a  yes .



      Chloe and Brian, coffees in hand, walk along the edge of Coit 
      Tower Park, deep in conversation.

                                  CHLOE
                    He left when I was really young, so 
                    I barely even remember him. But 
                    four years ago I found this old 
                    email address my mom had hidden and 
                    I sent him a couple of messages. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Did he answer?  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               32.              


                                  CHLOE
                    No. I doubt it s even active. 
                    Actually, I don t even know if he s 
                    alive. But it s okay - my mom and I 
                    make a pretty good team. Do not 
                    tell her I said that.
                          (beat)
                    How about you? You get along with 
                    your parents?

                                  BRIAN
                    No mom - just a dad, and our 
                      relationship is  evolving.  My mom 
                    died five years ago and we ve both 
                    been a little lost ever since.

                                  CHLOE
                    Well, here s to being found.

      They tap cups. There s a chance they might kiss, but... 
      Suddenly, a large DOG starts BARKING and lunges for Chloe. 
      It s only stopped by the tight hold its OWNER has on its 
      leash. Chloe jumps back and instinctively grabs Brian s arm.

                                  BRIAN
                    Ouch!

      The claws. She immediately hides her hands in her jacket.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Damn. You ve got some nails.
                          (to dog owner)
                    Dude, do something about your dog.

                                  DOG OWNER
                    She s never like this.

      The owner finally pulls the dog away. Chloe is freaked.

                                  BRIAN
                    That was kinda random.

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah. Hey - I should probably go. 
                    My mom has this thing about me 
                    coming home. Thanks for the coffee.

                                  BRIAN
                    Chloe, wait. Can we do this again?

                                  CHLOE
                    I d really like that. Bye.

      And she s gone.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               33.              



      Chloe, lost in thought, walks along the path but catches a 
      glimpse of a man in a long, black leather coat standing in 
      the trees. She stops and looks back. He s gone.

      Now fully alert, she hurries on but notices through the trees 
        a HOODED-FIGURE keeping pace with her on the path above that 
      she s about to intersect. She changes directions and heads 
      down a different path. And then she hears...

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    She s heading up. Cut her off.

      Chloe immediately jumps the railing and disappears.

      CHLOE s POV as she runs through the thick brush, ducking and 
      weaving. It s twilight; the long shadows make it hard to see. 

      Snap. She looks back. There s a flash of black moving through 
      the trees. She s being chased.

      She jumps another railing and lands on a steep path, 
      startling a few PEDESTRIANS. She turns right but there s 
      another HOODED FIGURE at the bottom of the stairs. She turns 
      the other way and starts sprinting up the hill.

      At the top is COIT TOWER. She ducks into a vestibule.

      She catches a glimpse of a hooded figure racing past. Chloe 
      immediately doubles back and heads into the building.



      She has a BIRD S EYE view of the park two hundred feet below. 
      The two hooded-figures jog past, obviously still looking for 
      our girl. One of them glances up and Chloe immediately pulls 
      back in, holding her breath.

      They didn t see her and start to move away. For the moment 
      she s safe. Chloe lets out a SIGH of relief. She turns away 
      from the railing but stops short because...

      The terrifying-looking MAN with three scars down the side of 
      his face is standing directly in front of her. 

                                  MAN
                    Good-bye, Chloe.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               34.              


      She doesn t even have time to scream before he violently 
      shoves her backwards.

      Chloe flips back over the railing, desperately grasping at 
      nothing. The man is already gone. She catches a glimpse of 
      the ground below as she plummets downward.



      SMACK! Chloe slams against the pavement. A WOMAN SCREAMS. 

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    She s dead.

      CONTINUALLY TIGHTEN ON CHLOE s lifeless face as BLOOD starts 
      to ooze out from under her head.

      Suddenly... Chloe s EYES POP OPEN.



      Our scarred assassin is flying down the stairs. Under his 
      coat he has a knife ready to unsheathe.

      He bangs out the front doors, but stops dead in his tracks. 
      There s a pool of blood on the ground, but Chloe s not there.



      Chloe is running as fast as she can down the path away from 
      the tower. She looks back to make sure she s not being 
      followed and...

      BAM! She s tackled by one of the hooded-figures. They tumble 
      across the ground.

      Chloe has her CLAWS out at the assailant s throat.

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Chloe, no!

      The second assailant pulls off his hood.  It s Alek.

                                  ALEK
                    We re here to help.

      She looks up and realizes that the person on top of her is 
      Jasmine. And they both have claws, too.

                                        ACT FOUR



      Jasmine and Alek each have Chloe by an arm and are hustling 
      her along, constantly looking over their shoulders to make 
      sure that they re not being followed.

                                    JASMINE
                    We were only supposed to be 
                    watching you.  You know, just to 
                    make sure that Alek was right.

                                  ALEK
                    I was right. I told them you d 
                    started to transform.

                                    JASMINE
                    But then we saw one of the Order s 
                      assassin s lurking around and knew 
                    we had to do something.

                                  ALEK
                    In here.

      He pulls them into an alley.  Alek deftly LEAPS ten feet up 
      onto a fire escape and scans the street behind them.

                                  ALEK (CONT D)
                    I think we re good. We re not being 
                    followed.

                                  CHLOE
                    Would one of you please tell me 
                    what is going on?

      He drops back down to the ground.

                                  ALEK
                    We should keep moving.

      And they start down the alley and out onto another street.

                                    JASMINE
                    Chloe, I m so sorry. There are 
                    usually people who talk you through 
                    this. This isn t how it s normally 
                    done.

      She stops.

                                  CHLOE
                    What s done?!  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               36.              


                                    JASMINE
                    Contact. Your transformation was so 
                    fast--

                                  ALEK
                    You were born in the Ukraine, no?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yes. But how did you...?

                                  ALEK
                          (re: store front)
                    This looks good. Come on.

      He pulls her into a busy coffee house.



      Police cars and lights. A body is lifted into the back of the 
      CORONER S TRUCK.

      Across the street, on the other side of the barricade, Chloe 
      is watching with Jasmine and Alek. Chloe has her hand over 
      her mouth - this can t really be happening.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               39.              


                                    JASMINE
                    It s not your fault. You had no way 
                    of knowing.

                                  ALEK
                          (sincere)
                    I m sorry.

      Chloe just turns and walks way, quickly. Tears are starting 
      to stream down her cheeks.

                                    JASMINE
                          (grabbing her arm)
                    Chloe, wait!

                                  CHLOE
                    Don t touch me!

                                    JASMINE
                    Please.  Just let us take you home.

                                  CHLOE
                    I can get home on my own.

                                  ALEK
                    She means our home. You will be 
                    safe.

                                  CHLOE
                    Don t you get it. I don t want 
                    anything to do with you.

                                    JASMINE
                    I don t think you have a choice.
                          (beat)
                    At least until we figure out why 
                    the Order was after you.

                                  ALEK
                    Or how they knew about you. They 
                    normally don t do this.

                                  CHLOE
                    The Order?

                                    JASMINE
                    Humans as a species aren t really 
                    crazy about different - the Order 
                    are the ones dedicated to its 
                      extinction.

                                  ALEK
                    They ve been hunting us for 
                      centuries.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               40.              


                                  ALEK (CONT D)
                    Trust me. You will not be happy if 
                    that guy in the park catches you.

                                  CHLOE
                    Uh, yeah. Too late. I guess you 
                    missed the part where he tossed me 
                    off the top of Coit Tower.

      A look passes between Alek and Jasmine.

                                    JASMINE
                    Just now? What happened?

                                  CHLOE
                    What do you think happened? It felt 
                    like I broke every bone in my body.

                                  ALEK
                    But you are still here.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sorry to disappoint.

      Another looks passes between the cousins.

                                    JASMINE
                     Only the Uniter has nine lives to 
                    live. 

                                  ALEK
                    That would explain the sudden 
                      transformation.

                                    JASMINE
                     And nine lives to endure.  Chloe, 
                    I... We re not supposed to save 
                    you. You re supposed to save us.

                                  CHLOE
                    Not happening.

                                  ALEK
                    You have to come. Please. The Order 
                    knows. They will not stop. Many 
                    people are going to die.

                                  CHLOE
                    No. I m not going with you. This 
                    has nothing to do with me. 

      She pushes Alek away, and he goes flying. CRASH.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               41.              


                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Leave me alone.

      Chloe takes off running.



      WHITLEY REZZA, 40 s, greying but handsome, the epitome of 
      wealth and power, walks out of the building and heads 
      straight for his waiting TOWNCAR.



      Amy jerks to a stop in front of this semi-abandoned looking 
      four-story building.



      Glass flying - Chloe lands feet first a floor below on the 
      fire escape.

                                  CHLOE
                          (re: landing)
                    Thank God that part is true.

      She looks up at the Rogue who is looking down on her.



      The Rogue falls back barely catching onto a fire escape 
      railing before slamming onto a landing several floors below. 
      He looks up at Chloe. 

                                  CHLOE
                    Still not even.

      He knows when it s time to retreat and continues to head down 
      the fire escape. Chloe takes up the chase. Alek and Jasmine 
      leap out of the window behind her.



      Chloe runs out into the street but it s deserted. Alek and 
      Jasmine catch up. He seems to have vanished.

      But as she turns away, we see him step out of the shadows and 
      hurl a knife straight at CHLOE.

      The knife tumbles through the air. But just as it s about to 
      hit...

                                    JASMINE
                    Chloe.

      Jasmine pushes her out of the way. The knife hits her in the 
      shoulder blade. 

                                  ALEK
                    Jasmine!

      Chloe looks up and the Rogue is already gone.

                                    JASMINE
                    I was supposed to watch you.

      And she passes out in Alek s arms just as Amy and Paul come 
      running up.

                                  AMY
                    Ohmigod, I ll call 911.

                                  ALEK
                    No! I ll take her home. We can heal 
                    her. I hope.
                          (to Chloe)
                    But the rest of us only have this 
                    one life.

                                  CHLOE
                    I m sorry.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               51.              


                                  ALEK
                    You can t run away.

                                  CHLOE
                    I know.

      And Alek lifts his cousin in his arms and hurries away, 
      leaving Chloe standing alone in the street with Amy and Paul.



      Amy and Paul are parked in Amy s car under a streetlight, 
      making out.



      The light is on in Chloe s room.



      PULL UP and away from the house REVEALING the SKYLINE and a 
      LONE HOODED-FIGURE crouching on a neighboring roof watching 
      Chloe s window. It s Alek.

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                        THE END
