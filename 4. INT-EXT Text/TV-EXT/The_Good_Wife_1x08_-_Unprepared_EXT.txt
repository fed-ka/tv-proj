      Kalinda, armed with hate mail, follows LANA DELANEY, late 
      20s, beautiful, focused, currently very swamped, as she 
      crosses a plaza with three coworkers rushing to a meeting.  

                                  KALINDA
                    It s just that I m in a time 
                    crunch...

                                  LANA
                    Does yours involve anthrax?

                                  KALINDA
                    Hey.  FBI bigshot.You owe me a 
                    favor.

      A raised eyebrow from Lana.  A smile.  What s that about?

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Give me thirty seconds-- it s a 
                    half dozen pieces of hate mail.  
                    Cops didn t consider any serious 
                    threats, but I need a suspect.  So 
                    if any seems remotely legit... 

      Lana nods: fine.  Stops mid-plaza, nods to her co-workers:

                                  LANA
                    Tell them two minutes.

    The coworkers continue on ahead as Lana rifles through them:

                                  LANA (CONT D)
                    Couple women in Wyoming: crazy, but

                    action.  This one-- 

    She holds up a letter-- a logo.  A cross inside a sun.

                                  LANA
                    Protests, vandalism-- not arson. But 
                    hey, people change.  They re also 
                    known for putting coded messages in 
                    their letters--  somebody behind

                    Have fun with that. 


      Alicia and Zach, mid-confrontation--  

                                  ALICIA
                    I can t believeyou--

                                  ZACH

                                  ALICIA
                    How did you even get here?  

                                  ZACH
                    I took the El-- I wanted to see Dad.  
                    Why wasn t he there?

                                  ALICIA
                    This was just for the lawyers.  And 
                    don t change the subject.  You talk 
                    to me.  You ask me.  I would ve 
                    brought you.

                                  ZACH
                    You wouldn t have.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I--
                          (wants to be honest, thinks 
                          about it, then)
                    I would have.  So trust me.

      Zach nods, eyes his mom:

                                  ZACH
                    I thought you kicked ass.

      Alicia laughs... 

                                  ALICIA
                    You re still in trouble.

                                  ZACH
                    I know.

                                  ALICIA
                    Let s go.  I need to get you home; 
                    then I need to check an alibi... 
                          (the manila envelope)
                    What s that?

                                  ZACH
                    This?  Nothing.  Homework.


      ...Alicia wincing as she exits her car, approaches Cary on 
    the college campus.

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay, well that s disappointing.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yep, disappointing-- as in it looks 
                    like she s sending threats to 
                    herself.  Where are you?

                                  ALICIA
                    Poly Tech.  The auditorium.  Cary 
                    and I are checking out her alibi.

    But Kalinda starts to break up.  

                                  KALINDA
                    What--?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m losing you.  Call me back.

                                  CARY
                    Hey.  So Walt came out of 
                    Auditorium Four, stood here--

      Cary already walking his way through the alibi.

                                  ALICIA
                    Right.  He came out at 9 pm, looked 
                    across the street-- 

                                  CARY
                      --thirty-four yardstoward the 
                    track where Ellen was running.  

      Alicia glances.  A few runners on the track.

                                  ALICIA
                    If it s this lighting-- that should 
                    be alright.

    But Cary looks toward Alicia s parked car:

                    Do you have a navigation system?

                                                                    TIME CUT TO:


      Alicia, decompressing on a bench outside.  Staring at 
      nothing, and then -- smiles as Will approaches, joins her.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Peter didn t get bail.

      Will absorbs this, then:




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #107   "Unprepared"   BUFF COLLATED   10/27/09      59.

                                  WILL
                    You seem... relieved.

      A long beat.  She turns to him, hesitates, then... ever so 
      slightly... she nods.  A tacit confession.  She is.
