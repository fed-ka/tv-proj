ODESSA - MAIN STREET.
DAY.
"Towards A Brighter Socialist Future", reads a billboard in the main
street.
Odessa, U.S.S.R - 1980
Fifteen-year-old YURI walks into frame.
He spies a long line
snaking away from the door of a barren grocery store.
YURI (V.O.)
I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of
Odessa in a country that no longer exists.
You might have heard of it - a little place
called the Soviet Union.
A YOUNG COMMUNIST sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in the
Soviet-style plaza, jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat,
poring over a Communist text.
Yuri approaches, pretends to be
interested in the statue, glances to the Young Communist's book.
YURI
(in subtitled Ukrainian, looking over
the idealist's shoulder)
All property is theft.
The Young Communist nods at this kindred spirit.
Yuri pats his
comrade on the back, taking the opportunity to steal the boy's red
neckerchief and Lenin pin.
CEMETERY, ODESSA.
DAY.
A sea of Jewish gravestones.
YURI and ANATOLY bribe the cemetery CUSTODIAN.
YURI (V.O.)
There have been few occasions in the
twentieth century when it's been an
advantage to be a Jew.
Under his father's watchful gaze, Yuri takes a rubbing from one of
the headstones - "ORLOV".
BRIGHTON BEACH - "LITTLE ODESSA".
DUSK.
In the distance, a roller coaster in Coney Island, silhouetted
against the afternoon sky.
"Little Odessa", New York - 1984
The camera travels off the coaster to a restaurant, apartment above
it.
YURI (V.O.)
We congregated in New York's Brighton Beach
because of its similarity to the Crimean
Sea.
I've always thought it's appropriate
we moved next door to the circus.
UNITED NATIONS.
DAY.
The idealistic YURI, ill-fitting suit, full of optimism, approaches
the United Nations Building.
YURI (V.O.)
Naturally, I went with the U.N.
They were
paying more.
He strides past Luxembourg's gift to the U.N. - a sculpture of a gun
with its barrel tied in a knot.
Never gives it a look.
He is greeted at the entrance by an attractive female U.N. Official,
VIVIAN CARLISLE.
She likes what she sees.
NRFL REBEL HEADQUARTERS - NORTHERN LIBERIA.
DAY.
Poolside at a recently-captured Southern-style colonial mansion, a
long way from Georgia.
Gbamga, Liberia - 1985
YURI (V.O.)
West Africa's Liberia, or "land of the
free", was originally established in the
1800's as a homeland for freed American
negroes.
It's been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since.
They even copied
their masters' Southern architecture.
A tatty pile of weapons - some from World War II - sits in front of
a long negotiating table.
YURI, blue beret, observes the CHIEF U.N. ENVOY at the table
opposite warlord ANDRE BAPTISTE, leader of the National
Revolutionary Front of Liberia (NRFL).
Baptiste, 40's, is an imposing figure.
In full uniform despite the
heat, he wears a jacket one size too small as if he cannot admit his
extra few pounds.
His THIRD WIFE stands next to him, wiping the
sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper.
YURI (V.O.)
It was my first meeting with the American-
educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste.
While
the warning signs were all there, no one had
any idea what a monster he would eventually
become.
I certainly didn't think he would
become my friend.
Baptiste has a U.N. document in front of him, awaiting his
signature, clearly enjoying his moment in the sun.
U.N. ENVOY
(referring to the meager pile
of weapons)
--With all due respect, Mr. Baptiste, you
don't seriously expect us to believe that
this represents your entire arsenal.
Baptiste shrugs.
U.N. ENVOY (cont'd)
This is making a nonsense of the embargo
ratified by all five permanent members of
the Security Council.
The escalation in the
build up of arms jeopardizes not only order
in the region but ultimately world order.
Baptiste smiles.
BAPTISTE
(playing to the gallery)
--World order?
You say we jeopardize world
order?
Baptiste's Third Wife wipes his brow.
BAPTISTE (cant'd)
Your idea of world order is when you're
giving the orders to the world.
The Envoy has no response.
Baptiste rises from the table, leaving the unsigned document sitting
there.
BAPTISTE (cant'd)
Excuse me.
Baptiste is accompanied by two armed BODYGUARDS.
Yuri's commanding
officer, CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE, motions for one of her detail to
follow - Yuri.
BAPTISTE
(irritated by Yuri's presence)
I am only going to the restroom.
YURI
(shrug)
Orders.
They reach the door marked, "MEN".
BAPTISTE
(aside to his bodyguards as he enters)
This is what they mean by U.N. Observer?
Yuri winces at the remark.
U.N. COMPOUND - MONROVIA.
DAY.
A pep rally for the mostly male U.N. PEACEKEEPERS.
A stage has been
erected in the rundown Embassy grounds.
They chant and stamp their feet
impatiently.
A U.N. OFFICER, acting as M.C., approaches the microphone.
M.C.
(battling the microphone's
feedback)
And now, we have a surprise for you.
The
83rd West African Peacekeeping Corp is proud
to present, all the way from El Salvador,
the newly crowned Miss World, Ava Cordova.
From behind a jerry-rigged curtain appears the vision that is AVA
CORDOVA.
She wears a dress that appears to have been sewn onto her.
She is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting.
The peacekeepers roar and whistle their approval.
YURI, near the front
of the stage, is hypnotized.
Standing closer to Yuri than necessary, despite the crush, is CAPTAIN
VIVIAN CARLISLE (attractive in her own right but pales in comparison
with the Goddess on stage).
She catches Yuri's reaction.
U.N. PEACEKEEPERS
(chanting to Ava)
Take it off, baby!
Take it off!
Ava steps up to the microphone.
AVA
(referring to the sea of U.N.
berets)
Baby blue.
My favorite color!
A roar of approval from the men.
AVA (cant'd)
I suppose I could give you the speech about
"my hope for world peace" but I have a
feeling you don't want to hear that today.
U.N. PEACEKEEPER
(calling out)
My hope is for a piece of your ass!
They roar again.
AVA
(laughing it off)
I don't know if you'll be taking me to bed
tonight, darling, but you can take her.
Ava unfurls a life-size poster of herself in a swimsuit,
flirtatiously holding it up against her body.
She tosses other
posters to eager hands.
AVA (cant'd)
You're all doing a great job - keep it up.
Enjoy the
show!
On stage, a generic-looking ROCK GROUP starts to play a cover from
the 80's - Tears For Fears' "Shout".
Ava dances enthusiastically,
provocatively.
Ava appears to make eye-contact with Yuri - blowing a kiss in his
direction.
He is paralyzed.
LATER
BACKSTAGE, YURI and other Peacekeepers observe AVA escorted towards
a huge, American car.
An inebriated U.N. PEACEKEEPER tries to get
her attention.
U.N. PEACEKEEPER
Ava!
Ava!
As the young man reaches out to her, a slick, handsome BUSINESS
MANAGER shoves him aside.
MANAGER
Don't touch what you can't afford.
The Manager slips into the car beside Ava.
The U.N. Peacekeeper and
Yuri watch the car roar away.
U.N. PEACEKEEPER
(regretting indulging the fantasy)
Let's get drunk.
DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - BAR.
NIGHT.
YURI and two other U.N. PEACEKEEPERS get loaded on local beer with
local PROSTITUTES - one of the peacekeepers pouring beer down a
prostitute's throat.
From the shadows across the street, a LIBERIAN MAN observes the
group.
Yuri's colleagues toss some Liberian dollars at a waiter and stagger
drunkenly away from the bar, leaning for support on the PROSTITUTES.
YURI remains at the verandah, exchanges a smile with a YOUNG
PROSTITUTE, at least two years from legal.
He's tempted.
He knocks back his drink.
He approaches the girl -
presses a few bills into her hand.
She picks up her purse, makes to
leave with him but he motions her to stay.
MONROVIAN GIRL
(referring to the money)
What's this?
YURI
(explaining the tip)
For the smile.
Yuri exits alone.
The Liberian Man, across the street, follows.
DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - STREET.
NIGHT.
YURI walks down a poorly-lit sidestreet.
He feels something in his
back - stops abruptly.
His hand reflexively goes to his holster.
Empty.
He turns.
The young LIBERIAN MAN is holding him up with his own
gun.
YURI
(mixing English and French)
Fuck, no, no, no, no--fuck, no.
Money?
You
want money?
(going through his pockets,
he starts pulling out loose bills)
Fuck, no.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot me.
Fuck.
U.S. dollars.
(referring to the face on a five
dollar bill)
President Lincoln.
The Liberian puts his finger to his lips to hush Yuri.
The Liberian appears more interested in the gun than the hold-up.
LIBERIAN MAN
(in flawless English)
Glock .45.
The Liberian produces a crisp U.S. twenty dollar bill of his own,
offers it to Yuri.
LIBERIAN MAN (cont'd)
(referring to the face on a twenty
dollar bill)
Jackson.
YURI
What?
Yuri stares at the money, bewildered.
LIBERIAN MAN
President Jackson.
He shakes his head.
YURI
No.
LIBERIAN MAN
(misinterpreting him)
You are driving a hard bargain.
He hands Yuri a second twenty.
YURI
(flabbergasted)
No, keep it.
Keep the money.
Keep the gun.
LIBERIAN MAN
(offended)
What do you take me for - a thief?
The Liberian stuffs the money in the pocket of the bewildered
Yuri.
LIBERIAN MAN
Demand and supply.
(referring to the gun)
There is more I am thinking where this comes
from.
YURI
(incredulous)
You want more Glocks?
LIBERIAN MAN
And the Heckler & Koch G-3 assault rifle.
YURI
What makes you think I'll do that?
LIBERIAN MAN
(quizzical)
I will come back and shoot you with the
Glock.
(checking the magazine, referring
to the bullets)
By the way, do you have the hollow point
cartridges?
Yuri stares at the man.
YURI
(facetious, nodding to the gun)
You got any color preference for that?
LIBERIAN MAN
(missing the sarcasm, regarding the gun)
Kelly green.
(meeting Yuri's eye)
I will find you.
The Liberian walks away, still admiring his new weapon.
Yuri stares
after him.
YURI (V.O.)
He'd come to the right place - peacekeepers
are armed to the teeth.
And nothing but
premium product.
The U.N. mostly buys from
Switzerland - where else?
EMBASSY COMPOUND.
NIGHT.
A white armored personnel carrier sits unattended.
The LIBERIAN MAN and two COLLEAGUES approach the carrier's door.
It
opens with their newly-made key.
The men start to unload the weapons inside the carrier, spilling a
box of ammunition in their haste.
The camera drifts off the carrier to reveal YURI, behind the
barracks, counting a thick wad of U.S. dollars.
Spying a lone BULLET on the ground, Yuri picks it up.
We sense he has
made a decision from which there is no return.
"THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT.
DAY.
At the back of the restaurant, YURI and VITALY sit on the steps
amongst the garbage cans.
YURI
You know who's going to inherit the earth?
Vitaly looks at him blankly.
YURI (cont'd)
Arms dealers - because everybody else is too
busy killing each other.
YURI plonks a glossy arms brochure in front of Vitaly.
He takes in
the contents.
VITALY
(regarding his brother)
It's a hell of a fucking career move.
YURI
That's the point.
I've seen how the world's
coming apart.
VITALY
And you want to help with that?
YURI
You can't stop it.
(warming to his theme)
It's a basic human need - we eat, sleep,
sleep with each other and what else?
Fight.
The oldest human skeletons have spearheads
in their rib cages.
Vitaly is still skeptical.
VITALY
What do you know about guns?
YURI
(joking darkly)
I know which end I'd rather be on.
(adopting a serious tone)
Every day there are people shooting at each
other.
I think to myself, what guns are
they using?
Why not mine?
VITALY
(hesitant)
I don't know.
YURI
(pressing his argument)
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht, you're no
fucking chef.
I can eat here for free and I
still don't eat here.
You're doing nothing
with your life.
VITALY
Maybe doing nothing's better than doing
this.
(referring to an image
of a gun)
Yuri, I've actually fired one of these
things.
Yuri puts his arm around his brother's shoulder.
YURI
That's why I need you.
(coaxing)
Brothers in arms.
Vitaly smiles, looks sold.
ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.
DAY.
ANATOLY makes his way to the synagogue.
YURI, hastily adjusting his
yarmulke, falls into step.
ANATOLY
(pleasantly surprised)
Finally getting in touch with what's
important, my Son?
YURI
(simply)
Yes.
However, instead of the synagogue, he is fixed on another
distinguished Jewish man, ELI KURTZMAN, on a street corner also on
his way to temple.
YURI (V.O.)
It wasn't God I was trying to get close to.
Anatoly introduces Yuri to Eli, who regards Yuri warily.
YURI (V.O.)
Dad's contacts at synagogue landed me my first
Israeli-made Uzis and an introduction to the
biggest of the big guns.
CLOSE ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF A TWA 747, TAKING OFF FROM JFK.
STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.
DAY.
A street lined with shelled buildings.
Beirut, Lebanon - 1986
Through one of the shell holes, we glimpse YURI and VITALY with a
LEBANESE CUSTOMER.
YURI (V.O.)
The job wasn't so different trom the U.N.
I
was just as neutral working for the ununited
nations.
An equal opportunity "merchant of
death", I supplied every army but the
Salvation Army.
We track with them, only getting occasional glimpses through the
holes as they make their way through the war-torn streets of
Lebanon.
YURI (V.O.)
We got our start in Lebanon after the
suicide bombing.
They enter a building carrying a crude rendering of a Coke sign -
"Taste Life."
The model drinking the Coke is Ava Cordova.
BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.
DAY.
CLOSE ON a row of military decorations on an army jacket.
U.S. Army Officer, COLONEL OLIVER SOUTHERN, in dress uniform,
adjusts the ribbons on his chest in the side mirror of a U.S.
armored personnel carrier.
YURI approaches.
In full view, he hands the Colonel a cut of the
money.
The Colonel places the money in the same pocket decorated with
ribbons.
STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.
DAY.
YURI and VITALY walk back along the shelled street, Yuri recounting
what's left of the money.
YURI
(irritated by the meager amount)
This is bullshit money, Vit - small fucking
potatoes.
VITALY
What do we do, go more legitimate?
YURI
No.
More illegal.
Vitaly nods thoughtfully.
VITALY
What I'd give right now for a plate of red
cabbage and potatoes.
The wall explodes with gunfire.
Yuri and Vitaly drop to the ground, money flying.
The machine gun fire subsides, a shower of dust, fragments of brick
and hundred dollar bills still floating to the ground.
Vitaly, first to recover, draws his own handgun, sneaks a look
through a shell hole.
On the other side of the wall, a firing squad of MILITIAMEN has
executed one group of MEN, lying contorted, slumped against the
wall.
Their bound hands and feet give the bodies a macabre
awkwardness.
Yuri is scrabbling in the dust for the cash.
The Militiamen prepare to execute another six men.
Men?
We focus
on one HANDSOME YOUNG LEBANESE BOY, barely in his teens.
Vitaly, gun poised, goes to intervene.
A HAND, stuffed with cash,
stops him.
Yuri.
The brothers' eyes meet.
YURI
(whisper, motioning for them
to leave)
It's not our fight.
Vitaly's eyes well with tears.
After one look back to the teenage boy, Vitaly reluctantly complies
- running with Yuri, heads down, away from the scene.
As they run, the wall explodes again with gunfire.
CLOSE ON RONALD REAGAN
- a cardboard cut-out planted in a sand dune.
YURI and VITALY carry a crate from a taxi onto the desert floor in
Somalia.
A group of MUSLIM FREEDOM FIGHTERS eagerly surround the crate -
Yuri hands the Leader an Uzi machine gun.
YURI (V.O.)
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.
The Muslim Leader tests it - shooting up the cardboard REAGAN.
His fighters applaud, Yuri and Vitaly slightly embarrassed.
HIMALAYAS.
DAY.
A helicopter strains in the thin air to land on the Siachen Glacier
in the Himalayas.
YURI and VITALY, in thick parkas, emerge from the helicopter into
near-blizzard conditions.
YURI (V.O.)
I sold to both Pakistan and India in their
fight tor the most inhospitable land on
earth.
INDIAN TROOPS, unseen at first due to their white camouflage
uniforms, descend on the chopper - eager to unload the new guns and
ammunition.
Yuri gasps for breath in the thin air.
An INDIAN SOLDIER gives Yuri
a hit of oxygen as Vitaly supervises the unloading.
YURI
How's it going?
INDIAN COMMANDER
(admiring a new gun)
We're making terrific progress - most
casualties from avalanches and frostbite.
YURI
(uncertain smile)
Make sure you thaw out the guns before you fight.
Yuri nods, takes another hit of oxygen.
BORDER TOWN - CONGO.
DAY.
The town is deserted.
YURI and VITALY are confused as they prepare
to unload an arms consignment from a truck.
YURI (V.O.)
We had our set-backs.
It's not called
gunrunning for nothing.
Up the street, a celebration is taking place - a band, balloons,
confetti, dancing.
Finally, a Congolese man, JOHN "CANNIBAL" NGAWE, appears at the
warehouse.
The conversation is in French.
YURI
(from the boat)
Cannibal, what's going on?
CANNIBAL
Cease fire, man.
Cease fire.
It's over.
YURI
What?!
What do you mean it's over?
CANNIBAL
Truce.
We're friends, man.
YURI
(looking to his unopened crates,
more and more agitated)
Friends?!
You can't be fucking friends.
Last week I spoke to you on the phone.
You
said you would not rest until every last
rebel was dead.
You called them vermin.
You said would piss in their mouths, you
said you would exterminate them like
cockroaches.
Just last week, you said this!
CANNIBAL
(shrug)
That was last week, man.
Cannibal starts to walk away.
YURI
Cannibal, don't you fucking walk away from
me!
Cannibal flashes Yuri a peace sign.
CANNIBAL
Peace, man!
YURI
Fuck you, Cannibal!!
Yuri looks to Vitaly.
VITALY
(referring to the truck)
Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans.
YURI
(nodding in agreement)
At least when they say they're going to have
a war, they keep their word.
NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN.
DAY.
YURI and VITALY stand at a checkpoint in the rugged mountains.
Guns and
ammunition are strapped to donkeys tended by MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTERS.
An
AFGHANI OFFICIAL inspects the cargo.
YURI (V.O.)
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when
they were still fighting fellow Russians.
But I never sold to Osama bin Laden.
Not
for any moral grounds.
Back then he was
always bouncing checks.
AFGHANI OFFICIAL
I hope you're not thinking of selling these,
Mr. Orlov.
YURI
(shakes his head)
Personal use.
AFGHANI OFFICIAL
There's a hundred thousand bullets here.
YURI
I'm kind of trigger happy.
Vitaly hands the Official his documentation - clipped to it, a thick
wad of bills.
The Afghani Official smiles.
He returns to his mud-brick border
station beside the confiscated merchandise.
Yuri focuses on a swimsuit calendar hanging on the mud wall - Miss
May is AVA CORDOVA.
YURI (V.O.)
And everywhere I went, Ava Cordova kept
following me around.
We were as
international as each other.
FREIGHTER SHIP.
DAY.
We tilt up from the water to find YURI on the deck of a freighter,
ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of Colombia.
North of Barranquilla, Colombia - 1989
YURI (V.O.)
Operations like mine provided the only way
for certain regimes to conduct a respectable
war.
VITALY holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness, not
helped by standing downwind from Yuri's cigarette smoke.
YURI (V.O.)
The freighter I was standing on carried 113
tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery
to one of the poorest nations in Latin
America in direct contravention of half a
dozen international arms embargoes.
Yuri makes a call on his cell phone.
YURI (V.O.)
To keep authorities in the dark, I often spoke
in code.
Rocket launchers were "mothers", the
rockets "children".
Assault rifles were
"apples".
The AK-47 was "the Angel King".
YURI
(into phone)
The Angel King will arrive
tomorrow...Hallelujah to you too.
Yuri hangs up.
His phone rings with an incoming call.
YURI (cont'd)
(into phone)
Yes?...Slow the fuck down--what do you mean,
tipped off?
They know where we are?!
Where
are they?!
Yuri grabs a pair of binoculars.
On the horizon, a fast-approaching
speed boat - INTERPOL AGENTS visible on the racer's deck.
YURI (cont'd)
(hanging up)
Forget it.
VITALY and the CAPTAIN, also spying the Customs Boat, join Yuri at
the railing.
CAPTAIN
Do we run?
VITALY
We have to get out of here.
YURI
No, no-one's going anywhere.
(to the Captain)
Slow--dead slow.
Buy me time.
Yuri swings into action, frantically dials another number on his
satellite cell phone.
YURI (cont'd)
(barking an order to a CREWMAN, referring
to the Panamanian flag)
Get that fucking rag down!
The CREWMAN hastily complies.
Yuri's call is answered.
YURI (cont'd)
(trying not to sound too
desperate)
It's Yuri.
I need another handle for this
tub...something in our weight class.
(to an elderly Latin PAINTER,
pointing to the stern)
You, over the side!
(the painter hesitates)
Now!
The terrified PAINTER makes for the stern where he's hurriedly
winched over.
Yuri returns to the phone call.
YURI (cont'd)
Yes, it's got to check out...you got a
shorter name!...what?--Kono?
How do you
spell that?...K-O-N-O.
That's good!
He hangs up.
YURI (cont'd)
(to the PAINTER, already blacking
out the name, KRISTOL)
Kono!
K-O-N-O.
The PAINTER, nods nervously from his precarious perch, starts to
paint.
Yuri sneaks another look through his binoculars.
The Customs Boat
is closing fast.
YURI (cont'd)
(back into phone)
What are we flying?...Dutch?
Later.
(hanging up, to Vitaly)
Vit, get me a Dutch flag!
Yuri checks the Customs Boat again.
YURI (cont'd)
Damn, they're hauling!
He checks the Painter's progress.
YURI (cont'd)
(agitated, grasping the line of
the scaffold)
Faster!
Or I send you in!
(checking the binoculars again)
Faster...and better!
The Painter's hand is shaking.
VITALY (O.C.)
(panicked)
Yuri!
Vitaly is frantically rummaging through a trunk containing dozens of
national flags.
VITALY (cant' d)
I don't have Dutch.
YURI
What?!
VITALY
I've got Belgium.
YURI
What the fuck use is that?!
(panicked, gesturing to the stern)
He's painting a name registered in the
fucking Netherlands!
Vitaly winces.
YURI (cont'd)
(mind racing)
You got France?!
VITALY
(confused, finding the tricolor)
Yes, why?
YURI
Turn it on its side.
Vitaly turns the flag sideways - now a makeshift Dutch flag.
Vitaly
nods, impressed.
Yuri looks forward.
The Customs Boat has almost reached the bow of
the freighter.
The flag is hoisted.
The Painter, barely completing the last "O" of
"KONO", is hauled back on deck.
YURI (cont'd)
That's it!
Everybody look innocent--now!
The CREW resume their normal duties as the Customs Boat slows to a
crawl itself, at close quarters with the freighter.
The heavily-armed INTERPOL AGENTS eyeball the rusted vessel.
YURI focuses on the senior agent - JACK VALENTINE.
While the other
agents wear sunglasses, long hair, tattoo or personalized uniform,
Valentine is completely by the book.
His Interpol windbreaker clean
and zipped to the neck.
YURI (V.O.)
They say every man has his price - but not
every man gets it.
Interpol Agent, Jack
Valentine, couldn't be bought, at least not
with money.
For Jack, glory was the prize.
The Customs Boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry
shark.
INTERPOL BOAT.
DAY.
VALENTINE never averts his eyes from the ship.
VALENTINE
Not exactly "The Love Boat".
Another AGENT hands him a phone.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(into phone)
It's clean?...It doesn't look clean.
I'm
boarding.
FREIGHTER / INTERPOL BOAT.
DAY.
From the railing, YURI watches the Interpol boat draw alongside the
freighter.
He surreptitiously makes another phone call.
YURI
(anxious whisper into phone)
It's Yuri.
Phone in a sighting of the
Kristol south of Aruba.
The boat is secured to the ladder that runs down the side of the
freighter.
VALENTINE checks his sidearm, climbs the ladder.
DECK - FREIGHTER.
DAY.
Yuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word "KRISTOL".
He flips
it around as Valentine and the other agents board.
Valentine strides past Yuri to a container, nods to an agent to open
it.
The large metal door opens to reveal a large container full of
grain - grain spilling onto the deck.
Valentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a mobile
phone rings.
A CREWMAN calls to Valentine from the bridge of the Interpol boat.
AGENT
(referring to the phone)
Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.
Valentine hesitates, returns to the ladder.
As the agents go, they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the
container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there.
RAILING - FREIGHTER.
DAY.
Yuri and Vitaly watch the Interpol boat leap away.
On the FREIGHTER, we focus on the terrified PAINTER standing beside Yuri -
a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg.
Yuri pretends not to notice, slaps the Painter on the back.
YURI
Nice job.
CLOSE ON the word, "KONO".
From the "O", a paint drop runs down the
stern.
BARRANQUILLA HARBOR, COLOMBIA.
DAY.
YURI and VITALY supervise the unloading of the freighter from the
dockside.
They are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the
outskirts of the docks.
A Jeep, full to overflowing with heavily-armed NARCO-GUERRILLAS
suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards them.
A military vehicle full of COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS chases the Guerrillas
several hundred yards behind.
The Jeep full of Guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter.
The NARC LEADER grabs a box of unloaded ammunition.
YURI
(in Spanish)
Hey, pay before you play.
NARC LEADER
(in Spanish)
You're late.
The Leader smashes the box on the concrete - bullets spilling
everywhere.
VITALY
Hey, fuck you!
NARC LEADER
(jamming his handgun in Vitaly's
eye socket)
Fuck you!
Yuri tries to play peacemaker.
YURI
(reasoning with the Narc Leader)
No, you don't fuck him--
The Narc Leader turns and shoots Yuri in the side.
Yuri shudders with the impact.
The enraged Vitaly lunges towards
the Leader but Yuri, despite his wound, holds him back.
YURI (cont'd)
No, Vit.
No.
(to the Leader, referring to the
bullets)
Help yourselves.
Free sample.
Vitaly nurses Yuri to the ground.
The GUERRILLAS ignore them, frantically re-load just in time,
immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle.
The government vehicle throws a vicious 180, almost toppling over.
The Guerillas, now back in business, take off after the government
troops.
Yuri lies on the dock, genuinely surprised by the sight of his own
blood.
YURI (V.O.)
The first and most important rule of
gunrunning is never get shot with your own
merchandise.
ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC.
DAY.
An exclusive rehab center.
A title appears:
Upstate New York - 1989
YURI's car pulls up outside, Vitaly in the passenger seat.
YURI
Get out of the car.
Vitaly doesn't budge.
YURI (cont'd)
I promised our parents.
VITALY
(desperate eyes)
Please.
YURI
Vitaly, you're going to have a good time.
This is a top place.
Two Ford models
checked in last week and that cute weather
girl's been here since July.
VITALY
Please.
Yuri relents, pours a gram onto the dashboard.
Vitaly snorts it off
the dash.
VITALY
(as he wipes his nose)
You're a good brother.
Vitaly kisses Yuri.
Two ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away.
Yuri watches his brother in the rearview mirror - shepherded up the
path.
YURI (V.O.)
I never understood what separated the
recreational drug user from the habitual,
the functional addict from the
dysfunctional.
But for the grace of God, it
could have been me snorting lines as long as
the Belt Parkway.
PRIVATE BEACH.
DAY.
AVA strolls down to the beach, deserted, save for YURI - sunbathing
some distance away on one of the hundred empty sunbeds.
Ava dives into the water.
Behind his sunglasses, Yuri watches her.
LATER
Towelling off on a sunbed of her own, Ava glances over to Yuri.
It
seems crazy not to speak to each other.
Ava breaks the ice.
AVA
(calling to Yuri)
Popular hotel, huh?
Yuri smiles.
Ava approaches, extends a hand.
AVA (cont'd)
Ava Cordova.
YURI
Yuri Orlov.
What brings you to St. Barts?
AVA
A photo shoot.
At least, that was the plan.
But the photographer's plane got stuck in
Miami.
Hurricane - though there was nothing
in the news.
YURI
(gazing out at the ocean)
Those things can come out of nowhere.
AVA
The job's cancelled and there's no flight
back to New York 'til Tuesday.
Yuri pretends to ponder her predicament.
YURI
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.
Ava regards him cautiously - likes what she sees.
YURI (cont'd)
(picking up his own camera)
In the meantime, why don't I take your
picture?
Ava smiles, poses playfully for him.
YURI (V.O.)
In my experience some of the most successful
relationships are founded on lies and
deceit.
Since that's where they usually end
up anyway, it's a logical place to start.
ST. BARTHELEMY AIRPORT.
DAY.
A limousine approaches a Lear jet parked on the tarmac of the one-
runway airport.
YURI and AVA exit the car.
YURI (V.O.)
I nearly went broke trying to convince her I
was anything but.
I knew Ava was not the
kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a
private jet unless you owned the jet.
CLOSE ON the tail of the jet - the name "ORLOV AIR".
AVA
(holding her skirt in the wind to
protect her modesty)
This is your plane?
YURI
(shrug)
That is my name.
They enter the plane.
YURI (V.O.)
Of course I was lying.
The plane was a rental,
like the car and even the suit I was standing
in.
At the last minute, I bribed the crew for
the paint-job.
As the plane picks up speed on the runway, the name "ORLOV" smears.
YURI (V.O.)
Luckily, by the time we landed, Ava wasn't
looking anywhere but in my eyes.
ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.
DAY.
Confetti.
YURI and AVA run through the paper shower as they descend
the steps of a synagogue in Brighton Beach.
YURI (V.O.)
We married in a synagogue to make my father
happy.
In the eyes of my Catholic mother,
it was worse than living in sin.
Yuri and Ava kiss his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA.
As the happy couple reaches the limousine, VITALY - out of rehab and
out of his mind - fires an AK-47 into the air as a salute.
The GUESTS drop to the ground - the only ones left standing are Yuri
and Vitaly.
Yuri stares daggers at Vitaly, helps Ava to her feet.
YURI
(explaining to the guests)
It's traditional.
VITALY
(meekly echoing the remark -joke
badly misfired)
Traditional.
The guests nod, uncertain.
YURI (cant'd)
One more time, Vitaly.
Vitaly lets go another burst.
YURI (cont'd)
(reassuring word as he whisks Ava
into the car)
I'm sorry.
I should have said something.
ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC - UPSTATE NEW YORK.
DAY.
YURI drops VITALY back at the exclusive rehab center.
By now Yuri knows the routine.
He pours a gram onto the dashboard.
YURI
I'm going back to Ukraine.
Vitaly snorts it off the dash.
VITALY
(maudlin)
I miss Odessa.
I miss you.
YURI
I miss you too.
Vitaly kisses Yuri.
VITALY (cont'd)
(meeting his brother's eye)
Be careful, Yuri.
Those things you sell,
kill...
(tapping Yuri's chest where his
heart should be)
...inside.
Two ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away.
Yuri stares
after Vitaly.
PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY - MANHATTAN.
MORNING.
YURI enters a public storage facility, opens a locker with a
combination lock.
YURI (V.O.)
There's no problem leading a double life.
It's the triple and quadruple lives that get
you in the end.
He produces several passports from the locker, shuffles the
passports like playing cards.
YURI (V.O.)
Back then I carried a French, British, Israeli and
Ukrainian passport and a student visa for the
U.S., but that's another story.
The locker also contains five identical briefcases - presumably he
can tell them apart.
YURI (V.O.)
I also packed five different briefcases
depending on the region of the world I was
visiting.
BORDER CHECKPOINT - IZMAYIL, UKRAINE.
DAY.
Light snow falls.
YURI, driving a brand new Mercedes, waits in a
long line of cars at the border.
Izmayil, Ukraine - January, 1992
YURI (V.O.)
The end of the Cold War was the beginning of
the hottest time in arms dealing.
The Wall
had fallen.
The arms bazaar was open.
Those forty-five years had generated the
highest weapons build-up in history.
The
Soviets had tanks and guns coming out the
demon hole - huge stockpiles and now no
enemy.
A Border Guard approaches Yuri's car window.
BORDER GUARD
(in English, checking Yuri's
passport)
Visa?
Yuri hands the Guard his passport.
Inside, a credit card
emblazoned, "VISA".
The guard smiles.
BORDER GUARD (cont'd)
Cash or check only.
Yuri smiles, hands him several U.S. bills.
Yuri's passport is
promptly stamped.
He is waved past the line of cars.
YURI
It's good to be home.
ODESSA MILITARY BASE.
DAY.
YURI, briefcase in hand, meets his Uncle DMITRI at a barracks.
(NB:
Dmitri always carries a hip flask of vodka as if there is a constant
threat of radiation poisoning.)
DMITRI
Nephew, come here and hug the luckiest man
alive.
The General gives him a great bear hug.
Dmitri registers the
apprehensive look on Yuri's face.
DMITRI (cont'd)
What?
Did you think I'd be glowing?
Don't
worry.
You can't catch it.
Yuri kisses Dmitri on the cheek to reassure him.
Over his shoulder,
Dmitri notices the car.
DMITRI
(referring to the car)
This is the SLK?
YURI
0 - 60 in 4.8.
Dmitri is impressed.
ODESSA MILITARY BASE.
DUSK.
The sun sets over a grassy field.
YURI sits alone - closely
inspects a Kalashnikov.
It is a strange moment between a man and his favorite gun.
As we hear Yuri's thoughts, we are treated to lovingly shot close
ups of the weapon and its features often seen in slow motion:
Sun
glistening off the chromed barrel.
Folding metal stock arcing
elegantly into place.
Precise docking of the 30-round curved
magazine.
YURI (V.O.)
Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947 - more
commonly known as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.
It's the world's most popular assault ritle
- a weapon all fighters love.
An elegantly
simple nine pound amalgamation of forged
steel and molded plastic.
It doesn't break,
jam or over-heat.
It will shoot whether its
covered in mud or filled with sand.
It's so
easy, even a child can use it.
And they do.
The Russians put the gun on a coin.
Mozambique put it on their flag.
Since the
end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has
become the Russian peoples' greatest export
- after that comes vodka and suicidal
novelists.
One thing's for sure, no one was
lining up to buy their cars.
We reveal where Yuri is sitting - on the roof of a rusting Russian
sedan, the Vaz 4-door.
A goat is eating the upholstery.
Yuri checks on the crates of AK-47's being loaded into a convoy of
trucks.
In the background, the armory, full a week ago, is now
virtually empty.
Yuri smiles a satisfied smile.
His reverie is interrupted by the sound of a car horn.
A commotion at the gate.
Another large, black Mercedes is parked
there, DRIVER leaning on the horn.
YURI smiles as he sees the passenger emerge from the car - SIMEON
ZAHAROFF.
YURI (V.O.)
Of course my idea was not entirely unique.
I had rivals.
Simeon angrily confronts the SOLDIER at the gate.
DMITRI puts on his cap, about to investigate.
YURI stops him.
YURI
He's a friend of mine.
Dmitri shrugs and complies.
Yuri strides towards the gate.
ODESSA MILITARY BASE - GATE.
DUSK.
SIMEON, flanked by two hefty BODYGUARDS, is in the face of a YOUNG
OFFICER.
The Officer is flanked by three SOLDIERS, Kalashnikovs resting on
their hips.
SIMEON
Do you know who the fuck I am?
OFFICER
(thick Ukrainian accent)
Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are?
SIMEON
I demand to see your commanding officer.
OFFICER
You don't demand shit.
Simeon reconsiders his position.
SIMEON
Just give me back my papers.
OFFICER
(papers clearly visible in his
hand)
What papers?
The Officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station with
the passport, starts watching TV.
The Bodyguards make to follow but
the Soldiers close ranks, barring their path.
Simeon fumes.
YURI (O.C.)
You're late, Simeon.
YURI breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity.
He enters
the guard station as if he owns it.
From beside his car, Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses the
situation with the Young Officer.
After a moment Yuri slips the
Officer money in exchange for Simeon's passport.
Yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the
veteran gunrunner.
YURI (cont'd)
I invited you for a drink once before.
Perhaps now you will accept my invitation.
UKRAINE MILITARY BASE.
DAY.
Row after row of tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopter
gunships in mothballs.
YURI (V.O.)
Helicopters, torpedo boats, armored
personnel carriers, whole tank divisions.
DMITRI, flask in hand, and YURI are given a tour of the surplus hardware
by one of Dmitri's brother officers.
UKRAINE MAJOR
(haggling over the gunships)
--I'll tell you what I'll do.
Buy six, you
get one free.
YURI
What about tech support?
UKRAINE MAJOR
No problem.
Yuri and Dmitri come upon an oily-faced BOY, perched on the cockpit
of a helicopter gunship - he wears an ill-fitting uniform, several
sizes too big.
YURI
Son, get off there before you get hurt.
UKRAINE MAJOR
(sheepish)
He's the tech support.
YURI
(incredulous)
He's twelve.
UKRAINE MAJOR
Thirteen.
Almost fourteen.
DMITRI
(shrug)
Kids grow up fast around here.
UKRAINE MAJOR
(nodding to the gunship)
He can take it apart in his sleep.
Yuri shrugs, shakes the Major's hand.
HILL OVERLOOKING ODESSA HARBOR.
DAY.
THE POV FROM A PAIR OF BINOCULARS - in the crosshairs, JACK
VALENTINE, at a surprise checkpoint, staring through binoculars of
his own.
YURI (O.C.)
Who are you?
YURI, on his belly to avoid detection, slithers back to the roadway
- hands the binoculars to a YOUNG SOLDIER.
DMITRI stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of view
of the checkpoint, including Yuri's Mercedes and a huge open-bed
tractor-trailer carrying a Russian Hind helicopter gunship.
YURI (cont'd)
(angrily to Dmitri)
I thought we were supposed to be watching
for these checkpoints.
DMITRI
How can I?
You keep selling my helicopters.
You're too greedy, Yuri.
YURI
(anxious)
We have to go back.
Dmitri regards the trucks, each one longer than the road is wide.
DMITRI
We'll be going in reverse.
We can't turn
around for a mile.
The YOUNG SOLDIER on lookout calls to them.
YOUNG SOLDIER
They're coming.
Yuri grabs the binoculars.
Sure enough, Valentine and his agents
are climbing into their Interpol Jeeps and driving towards them.
DMITRI
We shoot it out?
YURI
(shaking his head)
And start an international fucking incident
- no, no, no.
DMITRI
So we run.
YURI
No.
I've got paperwork.
DMITRI
(protesting)
Not for the gunship.
Yuri, you know the
penalty for sanction-busting - selling a
military helicopter?
Yuri gazes at the Russian Mi-24V helicopter gunship, bristling with
armaments.
YURI
It's not a military helicopter.
It's a
rescue helicopter.
Yuri turns to the Boy referred to as "tech support".
YURI (cant' d)
Get to work, Son.
The boy pulls a wrench from his pocket.
SEVERAL MINUTES LATER
The Interpol Jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy -
VALENTINE and his agents exit, guns drawn.
DMITRI and the UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS stiffen, their weapons also at the
ready.
An uneasy stand-off.
YURI gestures for calm.
He greets Valentine warmly - offers his
hand.
YURI
Yuri Orlov.
In reply, an Interpol Agent unceremoniously slams Yuri into the side
of his truck.
VALENTINE
(flashing ID)
Papers.
Again Yuri waves off Dmitri and his men, about to come to his aid.
Yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation to
the skeptical Valentine.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(regarding the photo closely)
Mr. Orlov, always in the wrong place at the
right time.
We've met before.
Off the
coast of Colombia.
(feigning memory loss)
What was the name of that freighter - I
can't remember.
Was it the Kono or the
Kristol?
YURI
(hesitates, he's actually forgotten)
The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of
them repeatable in polite company.
Valentine turns his attention to the helicopter - now devoid of its
weapons.
An Interpol Agent escorts Yuri at gunpoint.
YURI (cont'd)
(noting to the gun in his ribs)
The new MP-5.
Do you need a silencer for
that?
Valentine ignores the banter, inspects Yuri's documentation.
VALENTINE
The end-user certificate for this aircraft
states Burkina Faso.
Nice.
Did you type it
yourself?
YURI
It's for humanitarian missions.
VALENTINE
You're a humanitarian?
Yuri shrugs - why not?
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(not buying it for a second)
This is a killing machine.
YURI
Not any more.
DMITRI
(in broken English)
Listen to the nephew.
It's true.
Yuri has had the armaments detached.
YURI
Didn't you get the memo?
The war's over.
What can they do with military hardware but
convert to civilian use?
DMITRI
What, yes?
YURI
(trying to lighten the mood)
The only way you could die from this baby is
if a food drop hits you.
Valentine's face hardens at the flippant remark.
Still at gunpoint, Yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck in
the convoy.
Stacked inside the container are the helicopter's
hurriedly removed missiles and the Boy.
VALENTINE
(referring to the missiles)
Also going to Burkina Faso?
YURI
(pointing to the document)
But to a different client at a different
address.
Valentine, incensed, throws Yuri up against the truck himself.
VALENTINE
What do you take me for?
A complete fucking
fool?
YURI
(eyeing Valentine's gun pressed to
his throat)
Not complete, Sir.
And while I hesitate to
tell you your job, I must point out that
when shipped separately the weapons and the
aircraft both comply with the current
Interpol trade standards and practices.
VALENTINE
(incredulous)
You expect me to believe this is a
coincidence?
YURI
I can see how certain people might interpret
it as suspicious but thank God we live in a
world where suspicion alone does not
constitute a crime.
Valentine regards Yuri closely - this foe is more formidable than he
imagined.
Valentine looks to the gun in his hand, contemplating crossing the
line.
He finally holsters his gun.
VALENTINE
(tosses the documents on the road)
Yuri Orlov.
You and I are going to be
seeing a lot of each other.
YURI
I can hardly wait.
VALENTINE
(climbing into his Jeep)
Watch out for the time you don't see me.
Yuri, Dmitri and the Boy watch Valentine speed away.
BOY
(perfect American accent)
What an asshole.
Yuri looks to the boy, askance - a Yuri in the making.
ODESSA HARBOR.
DAY.
YURI supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter.
Checking
the empty trucks, he is just in time to see SIMEON and his HENCHMEN
climb into their car, parked beside his own car, some distance away.
As he drives off, Simeon and Yuri make brief eye-contact.
Yuri looks for DMITRI, exiting a nearby restroom - carrying his hip
flask as usual, the worse for drink.
YURI
(referring to the departing
Simeon)
What was he doing here?
DMITRI
(zipping his pants)
Trying to beat your offer.
I sent him on
his way.
He doesn't understand the concept
of loyalty.
Dmitri glances at the SOLDIERS around the docks.
DMITRI (cont'd)
Speaking of loyalty, too many people know.
I have to make pay-offs.
YURI
Don't worry.
There're more VCR's.
I left
them in your new car.
Dmitri's face lights up.
Yuri hands him the keys to the SKL.
DMITRI
Even your enemy was admiring that car.
I am
the luckiest man alive.
Dmitri hands his hip flask to Yuri.
Yuri watches Dmitri walk to the
car and climb in for a test drive.
A look of realization on Yuri's face.
YURI
(screaming to Dmitri)
Dmit--!!!
The car erupts as if it has been punched by a fist beneath the
earth.
Recovered from the blast, Yuri runs up to the burning car but is
beaten back by the flames.
DISSOLVE TO:
DOCKS.
NIGHT.
CLOSE ON a bent Mercedes medallion, now worn around the BOY's neck.
He regards it forlornly.
YURI, numb, still carrying Dmitri's hip flask, makes a call from a
payphone.
ODESSA HARBOR.
DAY.
The freighter slips out of the harbor.
YURI (V.O.)
In Ukraine since 1992, $32 billion worth of
arms have been stolen and re-sold.
One of
the greatest heists of the 20th Century.
DOCKSIDE - MONROVIA.
DAY.
Crates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting
trucks under YURI's supervision.
YURI (V.O.)
The primary market was Africa.
Eleven major conflicts
involving 32 countries in the past decade - a
gunrunner's wet dream.
Yuri sizes up the MILITIAMEN loading the arms.
YURI (V.O.)
My best customer was self-declared president
of Liberia, Andre Baptiste.
Even though
we'd met before, I was in no hurry to meet
him again.
He'd gotten a reputation for
routinely hacking off the limbs of those who
opposed him.
His seven-year civil war has
been described as "a relentless campaign of
sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to
those unfamiliar with the details of man's
capacity to visit the abyss."
That kind of
sums up Andy for me.
As the final truck door is secured, a customized Lincoln
Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo
blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock.
The car slides to a stop beside Yuri.
It contains ANDRE BAPTISTE
JNR., a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an
earring and a facial tattoo.
Also in the car, two BODYGUARDS and
a pair of LIBERIAN TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in Dallas Cowboy
cheerleader uniforms.
ANDRE JNR.
Mr. Yuri, I am Andre Baptiste Junior.
My
father would like to meet you.
YURI
Thank him but I have other business.
A busy
schedule.
ANDRE JNR.
It is not optional.
My father is easily
offended.
Yuri ponders for a moment.
The machete in the Bodyguard's hand
makes up his mind.
YURI
What do you know?
My schedule just freed up.
A bodyguard takes Yuri's suitcase.
Yuri is barely in the car before
it screeches away.
As the car roars along the highway on the edge of control, we hear
Yuri's thoughts.
YURI (V.O.)
But if I thought I was scared of Andre
Senior, I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.
Like father, like son.
The guava doesn't
fall too far from the tree.
He was a heavy-
drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for
cheerleaders and a lover of fast American
automobiles which he drove recklessly and
with total impunity around the streets of
the capital.
Oh yes, he was also a
cannibal.
They say Andre would eat a
victim's heart while it was still beating to
give him superhuman strength.
I could've
told him he'd get the same effect from a
pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli.
Andre announces his arrival in the main street of Monrovia with a
burst of gunfire.
The city, a violent clash of cultures.
Goats and
Gucci.
YURI (V.O.)
Monrovia itself was like being on another
planet.
Planet Monrovia.
From the
temperature it was obviously a planet close
to the sun.
I rarely saw another white man
even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the
"Little Kremlin".
And I never left town
alone.
Outside town, was the edge of hell.
I didn't want to even gaze into it.
The car pulls up to Monrovia's premier hotel.
A DEAD BODY on the
ground attracts no attention whatsoever.
ANDRE JNR.
This is your hotel.
(proudly)
Two stars.
A PORTER, carrying Yuri's suitcase, steps over the dead body.
ANDRE JNR. (cont'd)
(to Yuri)
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?
YURI
Part One, Two or Three?
ANDRE JNR.
(confused)
I have only seen Part One.
YURI
(nodding)
The M60.
You want the attachable grenade
launcher?
ANDRE JNR.
Please.
And the armor piercing bullets.
(revving the car)
I will be back to get you in an hour...or
two.
It's Liberia.
(mischievous smile)
We left a welcoming present in your room.
Yuri nods, uncertainly.
HOTEL - CORRIDOR.
DAY.
FAITH and GLORIA, still buck-naked, are tossed into the hallway,
their clothes flung after them, door slammed shut.
BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL MANSION.
DAY.
The camera tracks along the MILITIA - however only the very tops of
their heads are visible.
YURI (V.O.)
I had heard of the "Boy Brigades", "Small
Boy Units", "Kalashnikov Kids".
The theory
was that a bullet coming from a fourteen
year old is just as effective as one trom a
forty year old.
ANDRE BAPTISTE haggles with YURI as he inspects his troops ranging
from twelve to fourteen.
Yuri, averts his eyes from the boys,
uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he.
OLDER SOLDIERS fill the ranks behind.
BAPTISTE
I can't pay your asking price, Yuri.
We are
not a rich people and the market is already
flooded with your Kalashnikovs.
In some
places you can buy one for the price of a
chicken.
YURI
You can't just look at the unit price.
You
forget the ancillary costs.
End user
certificates need to be forged and
notarized, shell companies set up, insurance
purchased, pilots and crews hired.
Not to
mention the bribes.
You can't get a nut
and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a
bribe.
There's one bribe for the nut.
Another for the bolt.
This is an expensive
proposition.
Andre interrogates Yuri's eyes.
BAPTISTE
I pay in timber...or stones.
Baptiste produces a handful of uncut diamonds from his pocket.
Yuri's eyes
widen at the sight of the very precious stones.
YURI
(regarding the stones)
I'll take the stones.
It's hard to get a
tree trunk in my hand luggage.
Andre smiles.
He turns to his new Lieutenant.
BAPTISTE
(referring to the inspection)
Very professional, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT
(dismissing the troops)
Dismissed!
Yuri and Andre watch the troops disperse.
YURI
I know you're planning a new offensive.
If
you delay a week I can get you the armored
personnel carriers we talked about.
They
would give you a significant strategic
advantage.
Andre nods, grateful for the free tactical advice - regards Yuri in
a new light.
BAPTISTE
They say I am the lord of war.
But perhaps
it is you.
YURI
(correcting him)
It's not "lord of war".
It's "warlord".
BAPTISTE
I like it my way.
Andre smiles again.
They are going to be fast friends.
He leaves Yuri alone to examine his uncut diamonds in his hand.
YURI (V.O.)
Diamonds are far less bulky than hundred-
dollar bills.
You can get a million dollars
into a cigarette box.
ART GALLERY - MANHATTAN.
DUSK.
A GO-BETWEEN emerges from a gallery with a wrapped painting, hands it to
YURI, waiting in a limo.
YURI (V.O.)
By the mid-nineties, my wealth had caught up
to my lies about my wealth - even surpassed
the lies.
Yuri pays the Go-Between in cash, places the painting in the trunk.
PARK AVENUE.
MORNING.
The sedan enters the underpass beneath the Helmsley building - for a
moment the car hidden from aerial surveillance.
YURI
(to the Driver)
This is good.
The Driver pulls over, never coming to a complete stop before Yuri
bails.
Horns blare at the illegal drop-off.
YURI (cont'd)
(to the Driver from the sidewalk)
Take them on a tour of the Tri-State.
Yuri grabs Ava's painting from the trunk and the sedan pulls back
out into daylight minus Yuri - the occupants of the helicopter none
the wiser.
Yuri hails a taxi.
NEW YORK APARTMENT.
DAY.
AVA, dressed in a robe, all smiles, pours herself a cup of coffee.
She sips the coffee at the window, glances down.
In the courtyard below, INTERPOL AGENTS are picking through the
garbage cans under the supervision of AGENT VALENTINE.
Valentine
curiously examines the toy gun.
The smile is wiped off Ava's face.
She makes brief eye-contact with
Valentine before stepping back from the window.
Slightly shaken, she picks up the phone and dials.
AVA
(into phone)
Vitaly...it's Ava.
HIGHWAY.
DAY.
A heavily-trafficked highway.
WOMEN carrying water jars on their
heads, a thin COW pulling the carcass of a car, VENDORS selling dry
meat, CHILDREN playing war games.
The pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its
final approach - they scatter.
The Ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone-jarring pothole.
INSIDE THE PLANE - boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions
jump dangerously up and down.
Finally, the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines
shutting down.
YURI's head appears out of the cockpit window.
Curious LOCALS, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side
of the road.
YURI
(to the pilots, sizing up the
locals)
We're going to be okay.
The PILOTS are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing
supplies as they go.
YURI (cont'd)
(calling out from the window)
Where are you going?
PILOT
As far from the evidence as I can.
The pilots start running down the highway.
YURI
Wait, you idiots!
There's not going to be
any evidence!
Stay with the plane!
The pilots ignore him - run for their lives.
YURI is left alone.
He turns a lever marked, "CARGO BAY".
CARGO BAY.
DAY.
The rear cargo bay opens.
YURI stands beside his incriminating
merchandise.
YURI
(to the gathering locals)
Help yourselves.
Be my guest.
No charge.
One LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay.
Yuri hands him
an AK-47 and a box of shells.
More SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road,
seemingly out of thin air.
Yuri hands out more guns.
YURI (cont'd)
(to other locals)
Take the whole crate.
Two men oblige, ferrying the crate away.
The other locals become bolder, then brazen.
Soon it's a free-far-all.
Men, women and children swarm all over
the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted
down - also a lot that is.
Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush.
HIGHWAY.
DAY.
YURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of
grenades.
He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos.
Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses.
YURI
(muttering under his breath,
shutting off the calculator in
disgust)
What a fucking disaster.
Yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen.
YURI
Hey, not those!
You don't touch the plane!
(plaintive moan)
Not the fucking seats...
Glancing up the highway, Yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust -
VALENTINE and two truckfuls of heavily-armed Interpol Agents.
Too late.
The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away
on the back of a thin cow.
Valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane.
Valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay -
empty.
Other INTERPOL AGENTS fan out - futilely questioning locals.
Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush.
Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a BOY with a
lifevest.
VALENTINE
Hey, you!
The boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(exasperated)
Forget it.
The entire cargo has gone.
An errant bullet falls off a shelf in
the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up.
YURI sits innocently on his soda crate.
A frustrated African Interpol Agent, MBIZI, wound-up by the chase,
rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground.
MBIZI
You run from us.
(flashing a machete in Yuri's
face)
Can you run with no legs?
Valentine rushes over, pulls Mbizi off Yuri.
VALENTINE
No, Mbizi.
No, no, no.
Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuri's earshot.
Mbizi still wants a
piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner.
MBIZI
Let me disappear him, Mr.
Valentine.
He is
a devil.
Let me disappear him.
VALENTINE
I can't do that.
MBIZI
Look where we are.
Who will know?
VALENTINE
We will.
Mbizi stops struggling against Valentine.
MBIZI
Turn your back, Mr. Valentine.
I will go to
hell to stop him.
VALENTINE
(gently)
No.
(to his Agents)
Find the pilots.
Mbizi and another Agent reluctantly head off in a truck.
Valentine returns to Yuri who is dusting himself off.
Valentine
handcuffs Yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri back
on it.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
I've spent my whole career on the right side
of the line.
You're the first man I've
encountered who makes me seriously consider
crossing it.
YURI
What's the charge?
VALENTINE
What are you doing in Sierra Leone?
YURI
I'm on safari.
VALENTINE
(referring to the bullet)
Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns?
YURI
Are you with the park service?
Hunting
without a license - is that the charge?
VALENTINE
You're trafficking arms.
YURI
Trading.
But without evidence who can say?
VALENTINE
Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by
keeping the poorest people on the planet
killing each other.
(hesitates, unsure whether to
waste his breath - wastes it
anyway)
Do you know why I do what I do?
Yuri remains handcuffed, sitting on the soda crate - dwarfed by the
cargo plane.
Valentine paces beside him.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
(ignoring him)
There are more prestigious assignments, you
know.
Keeping track of the nuclear
arsenals.
You would think it more critical
to world security.
It's not.
Nine out of
ten war victims today are killed by assault
rifles and other small arms - like yours.
Those missiles just sit in their silos.
Your AK-47 - it's the real weapon of mass
destruction.
Yuri regards his interrogator curiously.
Despite the sun beating
down, he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of life.
YURI
I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.
I admit, a shooting war is better for
business.
But I'd prefer people to fire my
guns and miss.
Just as long as they're
firing.
He regards Valentine with something approaching pity.
YURI (cont'd)
I realize the unspeakable things that are
done with my weapons.
I also understand the
unspeakable things that are done with
Williams Sonoma carving knives and Wilson
baseball bats and they aren't taking those
off the market any time soon.
People will
always buy guns.
Why not mine?
Valentine appears to have no answer.
YURI (cont'd)
Can I go?
You've got nothing on me--
(unable to resist)
--but cuffs.
Now Valentine smiles.
VALENTINE
I am legally permitted to hold you for
twenty-four hours without charging you.
Yuri looks away, knows where this is going.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
You may ask, why do I bother to do that?
I
can assure you, it is not because I enjoy your
company.
And you may be surprised to learn
that it is not for any vindictive motive.
No.
The reason I delay you for every second of the
permissible twenty-four hours, is that I am
delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of
your victims.
I don't think of it as taking a
day from you but giving a day to them.
Some
innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one
more day on this earth because you are not
free.
Valentine looks to his watch.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five
minutes.
Valentine walks away.
Yuri is left to ponder the notion.
We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four
hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs,
eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun
arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being
cannibalized by the locals.
Finally the time lapse slows back into
real time.
Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents.
VALENTINE
You'll be pleased to know your colleagues
were no more co-operative than you.
Valentine opens the back of the Jeep.
Lying in the back, the bodies
of the two PILOTS shot and stripped.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
The locals got to them before we could.
Yuri turns away from the sight.
His handcuffs are removed.
Returning Yuri's documents, Valentine notices a photo of AVA and
NICKI in the wallet.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
Handsome family.
Valentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away.
HIGHWAY.
DUSK.
YURI starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo
plane is now just another carcass in the jungle.
A CONVOY of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the color:
U.N. white.
The lead car slams on its brakes, bringing the train to
a stop.
A woman pokes her head out of the window - CAPTAIN VIVIAN
CARLISLE.
VIVIAN
(pleasantly surprised)
Yuri!
Yuri Orlov!
YURI
(giving her an embarrassed hug)
Vivian...
VIVIAN
What are you doing here?
YURI
(approaching the window)
You know.
Fighting the good fight.
VIVIAN
An aid program?
YURI
Uh, yes.
In fact, I've just had some
transport problems.
You couldn't give me a
ride to Monrovia, could you?
VIVIAN
Sure.
Climb in.
Yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar.
VIVIAN (cant' d)
We're pulling out.
It's too dangerous.
It's a shame.
We were really doing some
good things.
Yuri nods in understanding.
MONROVIA.
NIGHT.
A MONTAGE OF SCENES FROM YURI'S P.O.V. IN HIS ALTERED STATE.
[A
MIXTURE OF FORMATS INCLUDING SUPER-8 & VIDEO, SHAKY HANDHELD
FOOTAGE, OVER-EXPOSED FOOTAGE, BLACK & WHITE FOOTAGE EDITED OUT-OF-
SEQUENCE WITH JUMP CUTS AND FLASH FRAMES]
YURI staggers towards the edge of town - still swigging from his
bottle.
A ROOM WITH A CURVED CEILING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA
YURI, eyes unable to focus, stares at a WOMAN'S FACE in front of
him, moving back and forth.
The gyrating stops.
Yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on
his back, a prostitute on top of him.
She gets to her feet,
adjusting her dress.
Yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself.
YURI
(a mixture of French and English)
I didn't fuck you, did I?
Did I fuck you?
PROSTITUTE
(in French, as she counts Yuri's
money)
It's not what I would call a fuck.
The prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him.
Yuri ignores
the money, staggers after her.
YURI
Are you sick?
She ignores him.
YURI (cont'd)
(screaming)
Are you sick?!
Yuri staggers to his feet - wanders aimlessly across a field.
A DANCE IN DUST SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA
Two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers
from a crowd.
The dust clears, revealing a bundle of cloth and
string doubling as a soccer ball.
The game is between two
indistinguishable teams of MONROVIAN YOUNGSTERS on a makeshift dirt
field, goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together.
YURI wanders onto the field, joins the game without asking.
The
players humor him by letting him have the ball.
Yuri dribbles up field, takes an enormous swipe at the ball, misses
completely, clattering to the ground.
The crowd and players laugh.
The game goes on.
Yuri, also laughing
but in a far more desperate manner, picks himself up and wanders
away.
A LIBERIAN BAR CALLED "ZANZI-BAR"
YURI throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from
rusted corrugated iron.
Rinsing out his mouth with vodka, he is distracted by the sound of
two little GIRLS arguing.
GIRL #1 (O.C.)
They will!
GIRL #2 (O.C.)
They won't!
GIRL #1 (O.C.)
They will!
GIRL #2 (O.C.)
They won't!
GIRL #1
They will!
GIRL #2
Ask the foreigner.
The foreigner will know.
The GIRLS approach Yuri - no older than seven, formal white dresses,
hands politely behind their backs.
YURI
Hello.
GIRL #1
Sir, will my fingers grow back?
One of the girls shows Yuri a healed stump where her hand should be.
Yuri runs away.
A MODERN SCULPTURE SOMEWHERE IN MONROVIA
YURI passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns
out to be a building pock-marked with gunshells.
Suddenly a FACE appears in one of the holes - SIMEON.
The gunshot
wound in his forehead still evident.
Yuri gasps.
YURI
Simeon.
Simeon turns and walks away - revealing a large exit wound in the back
of his head.
YURI (cont'd)
Simeon!!
Yuri pokes his head through the hole but Simeon has vanished.
Yuri
turns back to find himself trapped by TWO MEN in flip-flops, shorts,
Gap T-shirts and AK-47's.
Through Yuri's eyes the two men look like four.
The two/four men go
through Yuri's pockets, take his watch, shoes.
Yuri is oddly compliant - clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten
the watch.
One of the men, tired of Yuri's antics, aims his gun at Yuri's head.
His colleague stops him.
MAN #1
Don't.
He's Andre's.
MAN #2
(keeping his gun raised)
Fuck Andre.
YURI
(seemingly beyond caring)
Yeah, fuck Andre.
The man fires at Yuri.
The gun jams.
Yuri looks almost
disappointed.
The man tries again.
Again the gun jams.
YURI
(referring to the gun)
I'm sorry.
They don't usually do that.
Let
me have a look.
Maybe I can fix it.
MAN #1
(disgusted)
Fuck off!
The man whips the gun across Yuri's face.
A PATH OUTSIDE MONROVIA
YURI, face streaked with blood and dirt, wanders aimlessly through
the brush outside Monrovia.
A HYENA appears on the dirt path in front of him - teeth bared,
frenzied eyes.
Yuri stares at the wild dog - starts to quietly cry.
Tears roll
down his cheeks.
The hyena runs away.
Yuri is alone.
DISSOLVE TO:
MONROVIAN DOCKS.
DAWN.
A vacant-eyed YURI sits in the shadow of an enormous stack of arms,
unloaded from a freighter.
A presidential motorcade appears on the dock.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
emerges out of his Mercedes Jeep, gun in his hand.
He strides up to
Yuri.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
Yuri, you fucked up!
I am going to shoot
your face off with your own gun.
Yuri doesn't flinch.
YURI
(unfazed, regarding the man)
Not bad.
Andre's latest double?
The man's face falls.
The real ANDRE BAPTISTE emerges from the car with
ANDRE JNR.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
(to Yuri, standing beside his
uncanny double)
How did you know?
YURI
He's too eloquent.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
You have no heart.
Baptiste brandishes a copy of the New York Times.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
Have you seen the news?
They accuse me of
rigging elections, but after this in your
Florida with your Supreme Court of
kangaroos--
CLOSE ON the headline, "U.S. SUPREME COURT REVERSES RECOUNT RULING".
ANDRE BAPTISTE (cont'd)
--now the U.S. must shut up forever.
Yuri just smiles.
YURI
More good news.
That's the last aid
shipment.
The war is so bad, the U.N. is
pulling out.
Andre shrugs.
He regards the inactivity at the dock.
ANDRE BAPTISTE
Why is nothing happening?
ANDRE, JNR.
(reluctant to give his father bad
news)
No trucks.
They are trapped on the front
lines.
YURI
There are trucks.
You just have to get all
that food out of them.
Yuri gestures down the dock where food is being loaded into trucks
marked, "HUMANITARIAN AID"
Andre Baptiste and Andre Jnr.
are clearly taken with the idea.
ANDRE JNR.
Killing certain humans can be considered
humanitarian.
(thinly disguised reference to the
previous night)
Isn't that right, Mr. Yuri?
Andre Baptiste hands Yuri his payment - a slim briefcase containing
a pouch of uncut diamonds.
YURI (V.O.)
After surviving the last few days I'd started
to feel like I was invincible.
But there was
a weapon that could hurt me.
FIFTH AVENUE AT CENTRAL PARK EAST.
DAY.
A YOUNG INTERPOL AGENT, carrying a tray of coffee, approaches a
plain panel van parked outside Yuri's apartment building.
YURI (V.O.)
For the next month I stopped running guns.
I went legitimate.
The van door opens to reveal VALENTINE and other INTERPOL AGENTS,
wearing headsets, monitoring a scanner device.
The agents read
porn to keep themselves amused - except Valentine.
YURI (V.O.)
No wonder Valentine was confused.
PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.
DAY.
YURI locks his storage locker, observable from the street, and exits
the facility carrying a passport and briefcase.
YURI (V.O.)
I can always sense when I'm being tailed.
I
know what to look for.
But then I'd never
been tailed by the woman I love.
Returning to his car, Yuri fails to notice that AVA has witnessed
his routine from her own car.
Instead of following the car, Ava exits with Nicolai.
HIGHWAY - SIERRA LEONE.
DAY.
A fork in the road.
Two large trucks slog through the bush -
take the left fork.
Sierra Leone - 2000
YURI, VITALY and ANDRE JNR. are in the cab of the truck, beside the
DRIVER.
Andre is admiring his new M60 machine gun with attachable grenade
launcher - the gun of Rambo.
YURI
(concerned by the route)
Where are we going?
ANDRE JNR.
RUF - "freedom fighters".
Yuri stares out of the window.
YURI (V.O.)
Every faction in Africa calls themselves by
these noble names - "liberation-this",
"patriotic-that", "democratic-republic-of-
something or other".
I guess they can't own
up to what they usually are - "federation-
of-worse-oppressors-than-the last-bunch-of-
oppressors".
Often the most barbaric
atrocities occur when both combatants
proclaim themselves "freedom fighters".
The truck passes a checkpoint marked by two skulls.
REFUGEE CAMP - SIERRA LEONE.
DAY.
A tent city.
A Jeep packed with young, machete-wielding FREEDOM
FIGHTERS circles the refugee camp, taunting and terrorizing the
inhabitants.
The mostly WOMEN and CHILDREN are trapped by the circling Jeep.
Whenever a refugee attempts to escape, they are driven back by the
increasingly manic, shrieking rebels.
Yuri's two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest
of the REBELS are massed - a rag-tag mob wearing over-sized sneakers,
carrying machetes and the occasional AK-47.
At a small folding table a REBEL LEADER negotiates with YURI and
ANDRE JNR.
The Leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the table.
VITALY is more interested in the camp - observing the circling Jeep
full of Rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway.
From a distance, he spies a WOMAN and YOUNG SON make a desperate bid
for escape from the camp.
Two REBELS, on foot, give chase.
The
woman appears to be pregnant.
Vitaly watches in horror.
The Woman is quickly overtaken and hacked
to death.
Then the Boy.
Vitaly can't look, turns away.
VITALY
Jesus.
Vitaly comes to a horrific realization.
He hurries to Yuri, still negotiating with the Rebel Leader.
VITALY
Yuri, I need to talk to you.
YURI
Not now.
VITALY
(insistent)
Now.
YURI
(to the Rebel Leader)
Excuse me.
Vitaly draws Yuri out of earshot.
YURI
(irritated by the interruption)
What?
VITALY
(anxious whisper)
We can't do this deal.
YURI
(incredulous)
The fuck we can't.
VITALY
(referring to the camp)
Look over there.
As soon as we leave,
they're going to die.
YURI
(averting his eyes from the camp)
It's not our business.
VITALY
(protesting)
They killed a boy just now - as young as
Nicki.
Yuri flinches.
The suspicious Rebel Leader and Andre Jnr. approach the two
brothers.
REBEL LEADER
What's the hold up?
YURI
(trying to keep his poise)
There is no hold up.
I'll be right there.
Yuri draws Vitaly further away.
YURI (cont'd)
Vitaly, it's what we always know - we can't
control what they do.
VITALY
Today we can.
They're right there - close
enough to touch.
YURI
(angry, impatient)
What do you think they'll do if we back out
- they'll kill us.
VITALY
And if we go ahead - they'll kill them.
The Rebel Leader approaches again - this time he's not leaving.
REBEL LEADER
What is he saying?
YURI
Nothing.
Vitaly realizes the futility of the discussion, backs down.
VITALY
(resigned)
Nothing.
You're right, Yuri.
You're right.
(getting his head back in the
game)
Did I hear you say 300 IPG's, 500 assault
rifles and 800 grenades?
I thought it was
1,200 grenades.
I'd better check.
Yuri pats his brother on the back, returns to the negotiating table.
Vitaly heads for the trucks.
For once we follow Vitaly.
Andre Jnr. regards Vitaly warily.
TRUCK.
DAY.
YURI sits in the cab, staring out of the window as the truck drives
away.
YURI (V.O.)
Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of
gunrunning.
Never pick up a gun and join
the customers.
The truck turns the bend.
In the background, true to Vitaly's
prediction, the rebels descend on the tent village, firing
indiscriminately with their new weapons.
Yuri hears the sound - we detect a barely perceptible flinch.
SIERRA LEONE MARKET.
DAY.
"America's Funniest Home Videos" plays on a TV set.
The canned
laughter appears to be almost directed at YURI who is making a long-
distance call on a geriatric telephone.
We aren't privy to the conversation.
YURI (V.O.)
I don't know which is worse, Jewish guilt or
Catholic guilt.
My parents were like God's
tag-team.
We pull back to reveal the makeshift coffin sitting at Yuri's feet.
YURI (V.O.)
But I could not deny them the chance to say
goodbye to their eldest son.
MANHATTAN JAIL - REAR EXIT.
DAY.
A car trunk closes on Yuri's five briefcases and other documents.
YURI is escorted out the rear entrance of the city jail to the nondescript
sedan by COLONEL SOUTHERN.
As he's ushered into the car, Southern hands
Yuri yet another briefcase.
COLONEL SOUTHERN ushers Yuri into the car, hands him yet another briefcase
as the car door closes.
MANHATTAN.
DAY.
The nondescript sedan melts into rush-hour traffic.
DESERT - BATTLEFIELD.
DAY.
The desert where we first found YURI, the aftermath of a battle.
He
speaks directly to camera once again.
YURI
For someone who's never fired a gun or been
in a battle, I have suffered many
casualties in my life.
I guess that's how I
survived.
I never went to war...
His thought is interrupted by a burst of gunfire.
YURI (cont'd)
...especially with myself.
Yuri walks away through the charred munitions and black smoke.
In the distance the sound of sporadic gunfire.
