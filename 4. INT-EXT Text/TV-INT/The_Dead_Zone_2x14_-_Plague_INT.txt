          WALT turns off the engine, sets the parking brake as SARAH
            unbuckles and turns to the backseat with a smile.

                                        SARAH
                        Okay, guys.  Ready to unveil your
                          masterpiece?


          ANGLE ON BACKSEAT

          JOHNNY and J.J. sit in the back.  A felt-covered science
          project sits between them.  They sit stiffly.

                        JOHNNYJ.J.
              Yeah.Yeah.

          They look at each other.  Johnny summons a grin.



          The Science Fair is gearing up.  Nearly THIRTY STUDENTS
          ages 8-12 are setting up projects.  Several PARENTS are
          here, the ones who came early to help out.  Three TEACHERS
          walk the aisles.

          We track past a DAD intensely focused on rigging an
            elaborate Rube Goldberg series of tubes and tracks for a
          rolling ball.  His SON stands idly by with another FRIEND.

                                        FRIEND
                        So cool.  What is it?

          The Son's shrug speaks volumes, and we're now gliding
          past the next table with a magic marker schematic on poster
          board.  Another BOY practices reading his 3X5 card.

                                        BOY
                        This is how a virus spreads through
                        the human body...

          His MOTHER kneels in front of him, a captive audience. 
          We MOVE on, arriving at the table where Walt and Johnny
          set down J.J.'s science project. 

          J.J. anxiously pulls off the felt cover, revealing a mobile
          diorama of heavenly bodies.  A styrofoam MOON and light-
          bulb SUN mounted on an old Victrola and set against a
          black velvet backdrop of space. 

          Johnny plugs the project in and J.J. throws the switch. 
          The lightbulb sun burns brightly.

                                        SARAH
                        You guys, this is... wow.  Is
                        that the solar system?

                                        J.J.
                                (still worrying)
                        It's a model of a solar eclipse.

                                        SARAH
                        Really?

          Sarah looks to Johnny, impressed.  He nods to J.J.

          LAUGHTER from Kids turns their attention to another table
          where AMY GRANTFORK, little Ms. Popular, is surrounded by
          CLASSMATES who've abandoned their experiments to see hers. 
          Her board advertises "EFFECTS OF SURFACE TENSION" but all
          she's really doing is blowing bubbles of various sizes
          and shapes from different bubble-wands.  The ancient bond
          between kids and bubbles forces them to ooh and ahh for
          the big ones while hungering to burst them.

          J.J. watches the display, self-confidence sagging.

                                        J.J.
                        Amy's gonna win.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't count on it.  Remember when
                        I said I used to judge these
                        things?  Your teachers know to
                        look past the flashy projects.

                                        J.J.
                        Her Mom is the Teacher.

                                        WALT
                        Hey, you can't worry about that.
                        Far as I'm concerned, this is the
                        coolest project in the room.

          J.J. basks in Walt's praise.  He cranks the Victrola,
          points to a monocle mounted on it.

                                        J.J.
                        That's the viewfinder.

          Walt puts a hand on J.J.'s shoulder, looks through it. 
          Johnny watches them, Father and Son.  Walt nods, but J.J.
          doesn't even acknowledge Johnny, too excited to show his
          Dad the experiment.  Johnny steps away to find Sarah
          smiling at him.

                                        SARAH
                        Is that your Mother's old Victrola?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  Look, Sarah, I really
                        appreciate this whole thing, but...

                        But what?  You're doing great.  I
                        heard you two talking together in
                        the basement, it sounded like you
                        were hitting it off.

          Johnny shakes his head at Sarah, almost derisive.  He
          speaks quietly, surprising her with how tense he is.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We were talking.  I'm sitting
                        there, two feet away from my...
                                (stops himself)
                        I'm sitting two feet away from
                        him, and we're talking about the
                          distance between the planets --
                        but the distance between us seems
                        even farther.

          Sarah glances around.  It's the wrong place, wrong time
          for this, but Johnny's speaking his feelings and Sarah
          knows that's a rare thing.

                                        SARAH
                        I can only imagine how it must
                        feel, him not knowing.  We have
                        to tell him, but he's not ready...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, I didn't mean... it's okay. 
                        Really.  Of course, he should
                        know at some point but maybe it's
                        better if I step back.  For now.

                                        SARAH
                        If this is about Walt...

                        It's not.

                        We don't want you to step back.

            Something in the way he avoids her look makes Sarah realize
            something she hadn't considered before.

                                        SARAH
                        Unless you're not ready...

          There's a touch of "say it ain't so" in her voice.  But
          Johnny's reluctant look may be saying just that.  A few
          BUBBLES float into frame, in between them, disrupting the
          moment.  One of them touches Johnny's arm.  POP.          DEAD ZONE: PLAGUE - TEASER - 5/13/03 - PINK            5.

          A MOTHER cradles her CHILD on the floor, lips blue, eyes

          Johnny makes a beeline for Amy Grantfork.  Surrounded by
          friends, she giggles as he approaches, pulling her wand

          hook... WE SEE: MONTAGE of quick cuts from later in the
          episode - sick kids, lab equipment, viruses, faces in
          masks, etc. - all of it scary.



          Suddenly the flashes coalesce into a scene - a crowded
          hospital wing overflowing with sick kids on gurneys, lined
          up in the hall because the rooms are full.

          Johnny walks down this hall, reacting to the crisis.  He
          reacts to a NURSE wearing a face mask and a Man in full
          HAZMAT suit hurrying past either side of him, mid-argument.

          He turns and vanishes through plastic sheeting that is
            double-covering the doors to the wing, guarded by another
          man in Hazmat suit.



          Johnny has stopped in his tracks.  He steps back from Amy
            Grantfork and friends, who stare at him strangely.

          Reeling from the vision, Johnny turns around, facing Sarah. 
          She tries to read his look, and realizes he's looking
          past her.  She turns and we see what he's looking at:
          J.J., still showing off his project to Walt.

          Two kids, whom we recognize as the shrugging boy and his
          friend from the fair, let's call them CAMERON and OLIVER,
          slide out of the Gym doors, playing hooky. 

          They both peek back into the Gym, making sure they weren't
          spotted by any Teachers.  They turn to each other, smile.

          Cameron runs off down the hall, Oliver races after him.

          They pound down the empty hall, trying to gain a lead,
          heading for sunlight streaming through double doors...

          Light becomes shadow as Johnny steps out in front of the
          door, blocking their way.  The boys skid to a halt.

          Cameron boldly approaches Johnny, intending to go around
          him.  Johnny blocks his way, getting touched in the
          process.  We hear a DZ SOUND EFFECT.

          Oliver, afraid of Johnny, walks quickly back the way he
          came.  Cameron is more petulant than afraid.  As he backs
          away, Johnny can see he has (read: will have) clammy skin
          and lips blue with cyanosis.  Already infected.



          Johnny walks through the students, looking for answers. 
          Bubbles float past him.  He passes J.J.'s model, touching

          room as he awkwardly turns, reacting to who knows what. 
          Johnny looks over, and sees her looking at him.

          Johnny turns away to see young Cameron from outside in
          the hall, whispering into his Dad's ear and pointing
          straight at Johnny.  His Dad looks up, unhappy.

          Johnny turns again to see Walt entering the Gym.  Walt
          nods. 



          Walt and Johnny talk.  In the background, we can see
            Cameron's Dad complaining to Phyllis Grantfork, who gives
          him an "I'll handle this" gesture.

                        but is there a problem I should
                        know about?

                                        WALT
                        Nothing to worry about, just a
                          drill...

          Phyllis stares at them, then breaks into a weak chuckle
          and speaks in a more confidential tone.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        You know, it's foolish really. 
                        People see Sheriff Bannerman having
                          a private conversation with,
                        with... Mr. Smith...

          She hangs there with an, "and you can imagine what that
          means" smile.  Walt and Johnny stare at her blankly, not
          able to imagine what she means.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        Well, you know.  It's an image
                        we've all seen in the newspaper. 
                        Usually in connection with some
                        pretty disturbing news. 

          Walt and Johnny exchange glances.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt just wants to know who's
                        gonna win the fair.

                                        WALT
                        Anxious Dad, you know?

          Phyllis laughs, chagrined.  A cell phone clipped to her
          belt begins to ring.  She steps away to answer it.  Walt
          and Johnny watch her.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        Hello?



          Walt watches Phyllis on her phone.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        We're about to start.  Where are
                        you already?

          INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION - GYM/SCHOOL ENTRANCE

                                        BOB GRANTFORK
                        I'm out front.  They're not letting
                        us in.  Some kind of lock down
                        drill?

                                        PHYLLIS
                        Lock down? 

          Phyllis turns back to Walt, but he's already next to her.

                                        WALT
                        We need to talk right now.  In
                          private.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        What?

                                        WALT
                        Tell him you'll call him back.

                                        PHYLLIS
                                  (aggravated)
                        Bob, I'm gonna find out what's
                        going on.  I'll call you back.

          She hangs up and walks with Walt to the Gym doors.  Johnny
          stays behind, notices young Cameron staring at him.  More
          CELL PHONES begin to ring from other parents in the Gym...



                                        WALT
                          Phyllis, I need you to cooperate
                        with me on this...

                                        PHYLLIS
                        Walt, no.  You cannot lock the
                        school doors without express
                        permission from the principal.

                                        WALT
                        This is for your family's safety.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        My family?  What the hell is going
                        on?



          Walt stands in front of the Gym doors, trying to calm
          down the Parents inside.

                                        WALT
                        This is a routine inspection, and
                        I need all of you to remain calm.

          There's a knock on the door behind him.  Walt opens it to
          see Jim Pratt.  Walt looks relieved.  He turns back to
          the Parents and Students.

                                        WALT
                          Everyone go back to your booths. 
                        The sooner you cooperate, the
                        sooner the fair starts.

          Walt backs out through the door, and closes it behind
          him.



          Walt shakes Pratt's hand.

                                        WALT
                        Jim, I'm glad you're here.

                                        PRATT
                          Sheriff, you don't have the
                          authority to order a quarantine.

                                        WALT
                        This isn't a quarantine, it's a
                          precaution.

                                        WALT
                        We may have some kind of outbreak. 
                        These kids are sick.

          Pratt turns to see Johnny.

                        Where's this coming from?

          Phyllis is fearful, whispering into her phone.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        He's the one who got this whole
                        thing going.  Bob, what if he's
                        right?  He predicted that fire
                        where those kids died, what if
                        he's right about this?

          Jim Pratt has just met Johnny Smith.

                        You had a psychic premonition?

                          A vision, actually.

          Off Pratt, staring at Johnny.



          Mouth wide open.  Pull back to reveal Pratt finishing a
          cursory examination.  Sarah, Walt and Johnny look on
          anxiously.  Pratt checks J.J.'s lymph glands, takes a
          temperature reading from his ear.

                                        J.J.
                        I wanna go back.  They're going
                        to start the judging.

                                        SARAH
                        Just another minute honey... let
                        Mr. Pratt finish.

                        I know what I have to do.



          Everyone turns as the doors open.  Pratt enters, followed
          by Walt and Johnny.  He surprises all by booming out:

                                        PRATT
                        May I have your attention please. 
                        My name is James Pratt.  I work
                        for the State Health Department. 
                        We received a report of a possible
                        contagious health hazard on these
                          premises.  

          Audible gasps from several parents.

                                        PRATT
                        Upon investigation, I've found
                        this report to be a false alarm. 
                        So remain calm, breathe easy. 
                        You are free to enjoy the science

          Johnny sits in the hot seat, asking Purdy for help.

                                        PURDY
                        What you're describing... demands
                        use of the word "epidemic." 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd say that's a fair word to
                        use.  The State Health Inspector
                        used the words, "false alarm."

          Johnny begins to stand.

          Johnny freezes up.

                        If I know Sarah, she's having him
                        fully checked out, as would any
                        parent wise enough to listen.

                        I'd rather you not... call him
                        that.

                        From the bottom of my heart.  He

                        every way I can. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can start by staying out of
                        it.

          Off Johnny...



          DR. GRANGER, a pediatrician in his 60s, finishes examining
          J.J.  Examines his skinned knee.

                                        DR. GRANGER
                        What's this from?

                                        J.J.
                        Soccer.

                                        DR. GRANGER
                        Does he always wear his knee pads?

          Reveal Walt, Sarah, and Johnny in the room.

                          WALTSARAH
              Yeah.Yes.

          Johnny knew that answer, but was slower on the uptake.

                                        SARAH
                        Dr. Granger, is it possible to
                        run a blood test, see if he's
                          infected with something but not
                        showing any symptoms?

                                        DR. GRANGER
                        Can I speak to you outside?

          They all start to leave, but Dr. Granger stops Johnny.

                                        DR. GRANGER
                        Parents only, please.

          Johnny nods, makes as if he's going to leave the room to
          do something else anyway.  But Sarah turns back, making
          eye contact and saying "STAY."  She nods toward J.J.  And
          then she's gone. 



          Dr. Granger talks with Walt and Sarah.

                                        DR. GRANGER
                        I've gotten a few calls from other
                        worried parents about what happened
                        at Cleaves Mills elementary
                        yesterday.  I'd rather not draw
                        blood from a perfectly healthy
                        boy.

                                        WALT
                        Look, we're not asking you to
                        believe rumors or visions.

                                        SARAH
                        Right.  We just want him checked
                        from top to bottom.
                                (beat)
                        We need to know he's okay.



          The silence between Johnny and J.J. is thick. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry about all this.  I know you
                        don't feel sick, really...

          J.J. is quietly ripping the paper covering on the exam
          table.  Johnny nods to his knee.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That from the game against
                          Heatherwood?

          J.J. gives an almost imperceptible uh-huh.  Long pause.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know, this'll be done as soon
                        as he draws some blood.

                                        J.J.
                        He doesn't draw it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        J.J.
                        He doesn't use a pencil, he uses
                          a needle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah... I guess they should say
                        "poke" some blood instead.

          J.J. goes back to slowly tearing the paper.

                                        J.J.
                        I hate needles.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm with you.

                                        J.J.
                        They always say, "this won't hurt."

                                        JOHNNY
                        And it always does.

          J.J. is surprised with Johnny's honesty.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They poked my arm black and blue
                        after I woke up.

                                        J.J.
                        Did you really sleep for six years?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I really did.

                                        J.J.
                        Did you have dreams?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think so.  I must've been
                        saving 'em up. 

          Johnny's talking about his visions.  J.J. looks at him.

                                        J.J.
                        What's wrong?

          Johnny hesitates, wanting to be truthful, unsure how much
          to reveal.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a vision about some of the
                        kids at your school.  I saw them
                        getting sick. 

                                        J.J.
                        Bad?

          Johnny nods.

                                        J.J.
                        Do I get sick?

          Johnny considers lying, but decides to trust J.J.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes.  But sometimes I can change
                        what I see in the future.  That's
                        why we need to look at your blood. 
                        We're hoping it can tell us what
                          medicine to use so nobody needs
                        to get sick... okay?

          J.J. nods, seems to consider that.  Dr. Granger, Walt,
          and Sarah enter.

                                        DR. GRANGER
                        All right, J.J., one last thing
                        and you get to go home...

          He pulls a small hypodermic needle from a drawer, and
          removes the plastic.

                                        DR. GRANGER
                        This won't hurt at all... just
                        gonna draw a little bit of your
                        blood.

          J.J. exchanges a knowing glance with Johnny as he pushes
          up his sleeve.  Frustrated, Johnny exits the room.



          Walt catches him out in the hall.

                                        WALT
                        Now what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  At this point, it
                        could be anything.  If these kids
                        are going to be sick, they have
                        to catch it from somewhere.

                        We need to find the source.  It
                        almost has to be something back
                        at the school.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, but the health department
                        isn't going to do anything until
                          somebody gets sick.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe Purdy will work one of his
                          "miracles".



          We hear the sounds of a baseball game wafting in from
          another room.  Phyllis Grantfork pours half a glass of
          ice tea, and then fills the rest of the glass with
            lemonade, mixing them together.  She takes two of these
          glasses and turns to walk into the living room.

          Her daughter Amy is standing in the doorway, in her
          pajamas.  Her face is pale, and she's sweating.  Phyllis
          freezes in her tracks.

                                        AMY GRANTFORK
                        Mommy, I don't feel so good...

          One of the glasses slips out of Phyllis' hand and shatters
          on the floor.



          Pitch black.  The double doors open, letting light from
          the hallway spill in.  A pair of silhouettes enter, and a
          beat later the overhead lights power on, revealing:  


          JOHNNY AND PRATT

          Followed by a FOUR MAN HEALTH DEPARTMENT TEAM, who wear
          blue paper suits and re-breather masks.  Johnny and Pratt
          are dressed normally; no face masks.

                                        PRATT
                        So how exactly do you know the
                          governor?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We have a mutual friend.

          The science fair is like a ghost town.  Many projects are
          still sitting on their tables, abandoned in the earlier
          exodus from the Gym.  Pratt's attitude tells us that for
          him, this is a dog and pony show.

                                        PRATT
                        Okay, you guys know the drill. 
                        Andy, you and Harve check the air
                          conditioning systems and all the
                          ductwork.  Quinn, you take the
                        cafeteria.  Full kitchen sweep.

          Three men take off, leaving one remaining, who looks
          pissed.

                                        SAM
                        Lemme guess.  Bathrooms.

                        Have fun.

                        Air samples, surface swabs,
                          biofilms on all standing water.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we should wear masks.

                                        PRATT
                        What does it matter?  According
                        to you, we've already been exposed.

          Pratt's tone drips with disbelief, but Johnny is still
          thankful that action is being taken.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whether you believe me or not,
                        thank you.

                                        PRATT
                        Let's get one thing straight,
                        Smith.  I don't want to be here.

                        who happen to believe your "palm
                        readings."  But I do intend to
                        make a detailed inspection and an
                          extremely detailed report, to
                        make sure this kind of hoax doesn't
                        happen again.

                        Good.

          Pratt walks over to an empty table (some kids did grab
          their projects before they left), and sets his case down,
          opening to reveal the tools of his trade. 

          Johnny walks along the row of abandoned projects, stopping
          at a familiar poster: "This is how a virus spreads through
          a body..."

          Johnny stares at the crude diagram.  It triggers a thought. 
          He walks over to the table where Amy Grantfork was blowing
          bubbles. 

          The bucket of dish soap is still there.  Johnny's hand

          Johnny turns and quickly heads to Pratt, who is busy taking

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have an idea about the source. 
                        During the fair, a third grader
                        was blowing giant soap bubbles
                        all over the room.

                                        PRATT
                        Sounds lethal.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Every kid was touching them. 
                        That's when I got the visions...

          Pratt shakes his head at the word visions.  Johnny decides
          to ignore it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The bucket's still here.  Is there
                        any chance that the formula could
                        be contaminated?  Maybe toxic...

                                        PRATT
                        You're talking about a mixture of
                          glycerin and dishwashing detergent. 
                        Which, when it's not floating
                        around being pretty, is busy
                        killing germs by the millions. 
                        But I'll take a sample, if it
                        pleases you.

    49CONTINUED:49

          Pratt turns away.  Johnny thinks.  He knows this means
          something.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about inside the bubbles?

                                        PRATT
                        You mean air?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I mean breath.

          Pratt pauses at that.  Johnny can feel it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Breath from an infected person. 
                          Preserved in a pretty little sphere
                        until another person comes in
                        contact with it.

                                        PRATT
                        Cute.  But not likely.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But possible?

          Pratt's sigh admits as much.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then we're going to Amy Grantfork's
                        house.

                                        PRATT
                        No way.  I'm already paying
                          overtime on four people to sweep
                        this school.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then cut 'em loose.  It'll just
                        be you and me.  I'll make sure 
                        the Governor knows we received
                        your full cooperation. 

          Pratt glowers at Johnny.

                                        PRATT
                        I have real health emergencies to
                        deal with, Smith.  Where people
                          actually get sick.  I don't have
                        time to accompany you on a wild
                        goose chase.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then let's get it over with. 
                        Right now.

          Johnny holds the man's glare.



          Looking at the front door.  Knock Knock Knock.

          BOB GRANTFORK heads to the door, opens it to reveal Johnny
          standing with Jim Pratt.  Bob becomes very still.  Pratt
          starts in, embarrassed, perfunctory.

                                        PRATT
                        Mr. Grantfork, my name is James
                        Pratt, I'm with the State Health
                          Department...

                                        BOB GRANTFORK
                        I know who you are.  Listen, I
                        don't know what my wife told you,
                        but we have everything under
                          control.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Phyllis didn't call us.

                                        PHYLLIS (O.S.)
                        Oh My God.

          They turn to see Phyllis, who has walked up behind Bob.

                                        PHYLLIS
                          Something's wrong.  I knew it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Phyllis... Is your daughter sick?

                                        BOB GRANTFORK
                        Honey, go back to the living room.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        She's running a fever.

          And that catches Pratt's attention.  Johnny doesn't betray
          any "I told you so" behavior. 

                                        PRATT
                        Would you mind if I took a look
                        at her?  I'm a doctor.          DEAD ZONE: PLAGUE - ACT TWO - 5/13/03 - PINK          31.



          Pratt is on one knee in front of Amy, who sits on the
          couch, wrapped in an afghan, a digital thermometer in her
          mouth.  The thermometer beeps and Pratt checks it.

                                        PRATT
                        One hundred and one degrees.

                                        BOB GRANTFORK
                        See?  Not even that serious.

          Johnny is standing aside, letting Pratt do his thing.

                                        PHYLLIS
                                (re: Johnny)
                        If it wasn't serious, he wouldn't
                        be here.

                                        BOB GRANTFORK
                        You're scaring Amy.

                                        AMY GRANTFORK
                        I'm not scared.  I think it's
                        cool.

          She says this while directly staring at Johnny.

                                        PRATT
                        That's good.  There's no reason
                        to be scared.  Amy, do you remember
                        being around anyone who was sick
                          recently? 

          Amy stares at him.

                                        PRATT
                        Were any of your friends at school
                        sick?
                                (she shakes her head)
                        Do you play sports?
                                (she shakes her head)
                        Were you around any animals, maybe
                        in your back yard.  A possum, or
                        a raccoon?

          She smiles and shakes her head because that's a pretty
          silly question.  Johnny stirs, impatient.

                                        PRATT
                        Okay, Amy.  What I'm gonna do is
                        have you say "ahh," and I'm going
                        to swab a little Q-tip inside
                        your mouth.  And then I'm gonna
                        ask your Mom to make you some
                        chicken soup and then I want you
                        to try and get some sleep.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jim, can I talk to you for a
                        second?

          Pratt does a slow burn to Johnny, but Johnny manages to
          pull him aside, speaks low.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Chicken soup?  That's it?

                                        PRATT
                        I'm taking a throat culture, we'll
                        run tests, what else do you want? 
                        Admit her to the E.R. with a fever
                        and cough?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Regardless of what you think,
                        this is not an isolated case of
                        the sniffles.  It's an infectious
                        disease and it's going to start
                        killing people if we don't find
                        the source.

                                        PRATT
                        You wanted the experts to get
                          involved, well, then, leave the
                        job to the experts.  That means
                          gathering data, testing it, and
                        waiting for verifiable results. 
                        There are no shortcuts. 

          Johnny, frustrated, looks over at Amy.  He turns from
          Pratt and approaches her, kneels down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How's your head feel?

                                        AMY GRANTFORK
                        Hot.  But I'm cold.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mind if I see?

          She nods okay.

          Bob Grantfork tenses as Johnny puts his hand on Amy's
            forehead, sparkling with sweat.  RAMP INTO --


  5252JOHNNY' FACE --

          But instead of cutting to a VISION, there is a LIGHTING
          CHANGE, and our scene MORPHS slightly to reveal Amy's hot
          Babysitter, ELLE (17), making out with her older boyfriend
          MIKE (22), on the couch.  Amy, Phyllis, Bob, and Pratt
          have vanished from the room - we are looking at sometime
          several nights ago.  Mike and Elle are passionately making
          out, mouths locked to each other.  Mike laughs, breaking
          the kiss...

                                        MIKE
                        How come none of my babysitters
                        ever looked like you? 

                                        ELLE
                        Shh, Amy's gonna wake up.

          Mike takes advantage of the break in the action to fire
          up a joint.

                                        ELLE
                        Are you crazy?  Put that out.

          He lifts his head to the ceiling and opens his mouth. 
          SMOKE billows out, and suddenly our perspective shifts
          and the ROOM MORPHS TO:


  5353ANOTHER COUCH - (DIFFERENT LOCATION) - VISION

          Where Mike reclines in a similar way (now in different
            clothes), letting smoke ring out of his mouth.  We notice
          a BLUNT held in his hand.  He's sitting next to his slacker
          friend STEVE, who's already stoned.

                                        STEVE
                        Dude, you're supposed to hold it
                        in.

                                        MIKE
                        I like to blow smoke rings, man. 
                        Like one of those Hobbit dudes.

          Steve considers this, then they both crack up.  Mike lazily
          passes the blunt BACK to Steve, and we FOCUS on it as it
          is passed, and suddenly Steve is YANKED OFF THE COUCH
          like a marionette to a standing position as CAMERA WHIRLS
          around him and the scene again MORPHS TO:          DEAD ZONE: PLAGUE - ACT TWO - 5/13/03 - PINK          34.



          Johnny in the living room, absorbing this.

          Pratt watches Johnny stand up, flip out a cell phone, and
          head out of the room.  As he passes Phyllis...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me.

                                        PHYLLIS
                        Wait, is she going to be alright?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Best way to make sure is to get
                        her to the hospital.  Tonight.

          Johnny walks into the landing, dials the phone, and waits. 
          Pratt appears behind him, followed by Phyllis and Bob.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt.  I need your help.



          Moving HANDHELD down the hall toward the front door.  A
          STONED GUY walks out of the kitchen, passing through shot
          to the living room.  Right after he clears, the door
            SPLINTERS OPEN, forced by a hand-held battering ram.

          rush in, HANDHELD as they take the hall and spill into
          the living room, where 2 GIRLS and 2 GUYS are sharing
          drinks, joints, maybe even needles.

                                        WALT
                          Everybody down!  Right now!  C'mon,
                        kiss the shag.

          They slowly move down to the carpeting.

                                        WALT
                        Where's Cirillo?  Where's Rob?

          Some fingers point to the rear of the house.  Walt nods
          for his other Deputy to cover them.  We follow Walt back
          down the hall, catching a glimpse of Johnny and Pratt
          outside with Roscoe.

          Weaves through the kitchen and kicks down another door to
          reveal ROB CIRILLO in bed.  Looking like death warmed
          over.  On drugs.

                                        ROB CIRILLO
                                (weak)

          He coughs.  Seriously ill.

                                        WALT
                        We'll take care of that later. 
                        Right now we're going to have a
                        little talk.

          Walt pats Rob down, who's too weak to resist.  He reaches
          under his pillow, pulls out a plastic baggie with who
          knows what kind of drugs.

                                        ROB CIRILLO

                        Hey what's with the masks?

          Johnny and Pratt enter the room, Pratt looking around,
          disturbed.

                        going to make those kids sick,
                        he's got it.

                          anybody.

            Suddenly, Walt's cell phone rings.  He answers.

          Sarah's calling from a hospital pay phone, freaking out.

                        You've wasted enough of my time.

          Walt cuffs him, lifts him up, and starts to walk him out,
          helping Rob as he stumbles.  Walt's look to Johnny is
          dark as he walks Rob through the door.

                          started.

          Johnny reacts, looking to Pratt, whose skepticism is
          starting to crack.

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:


          Johnny, Walt, and Pratt enter the hospital wing, and start
          heading down the hall.

          Pratt glances in ROOMS as he passes them.  SICK KIDS are
          in hospital beds.  PARENTS cross in the halls, looking at
          Johnny.  We recognize them from the Science Fair.  Pratt
          drops back and takes out his cell phone.  Speed dials.

          The NURSE from Johnny's teaser vision passes Pratt.

                                        NURSE
                        Sir, you can't use that in here.

          He ignores her.

                                        PRATT
                                (into phone)
                        Hey, it's Jim.  Put me through to
                        the C.D.C.  Right now.



          Walt and Johnny enter the room and are hit by the sight
          of J.J. in a hospital gown, asleep in bed, hooked up to
          an I.V.  Sarah sits near him, holding a cooling pack to
          his forehead.  Walt hurries to J.J.

                          stronger... until they know what's
                        causing this.

          Johnny wordlessly approaches, looking down at J.J., who
          is clearly flushed with fever.  Sarah turns to him.

          Johnny begins to extricate himself from the room.

                        Wait.

          Panicked emotion catches in Sarah's throat.  She struggles
          to control it.  Johnny stops.

                                        SARAH

                        I need you to tell me if he's
                        going to be okay.

          Johnny is caught off guard.  Sarah is doing everything
          she can to hold it together. 

          Walt reaches out to pull Sarah into his arms.  She resists
          the embrace, knowing its goal is to ease her fear.  She
          doesn't want to ease her fear.

                                        SARAH

                        You can't ask that.

          She pushes back from Walt, angry through her tears.

                                        SARAH
                        I can't not ask it.  If you don't
                        want to know, then walk away.

                        I do.

          Sarah looks at Johnny, can see he doesn't want to touch
          J.J. and look into what the future might hold...

                        I don't know what I'd do.

          He locks eyes with Walt, then walks out.  Sarah breaks
          down.  Walt again draws her close, and this time she
          doesn't resist.  Crying into his arms..

          His eyes opened to slits.  How long was he listening?

          Johnny enters to find Pratt here, filling up a white board
          with the information they have so far.  He's into it now. 
          The board is divided into two columns, the first is a

                          probably a virus -- that causes
                        high fever, respiratory distress
                        and doesn't respond to a normal

          The voice startles them.  They turn to see RITA NAVARRO,

          full hazmat gear (as is her entire team).

                        everything you know so far, but
                        first we need to run viral cultures

                        you two.

          Rob Cirillo rests on the bed, seriously ill.  A packet of
          heroin lands on his lap.  He looks up to see Johnny, Pratt,
          and Walt (who tossed the bag) entering the room (they all
          wear masks).

                                        WALT
                          Recognize this, Cirillo?

                        No.  That your personal stash
                        Bannerman?

                        heroin.  Made there, smuggled

                        Very original.

                        China?  Don't flu viruses start
                        in China?

          Rob coughs.  A dry, hacking sound.

                                        PRATT
                        Yeah, a lot of viruses do, but
                        the drugs aren't our source.  We
                        need a live carrier for
                          transmission. 
                                (then to Cirillo)
                        Whoever brought this heroin to
                        you, made you sick.

                        Who is it, Rob?  A mule?  A

                                        ROB CIRILLO
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about.

          Walt, under great stress, loses his temper and grabs a
          fistful of Cirillo's shirt.

                        Walt.

          Walt hesitates.  Johnny walks up beside him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me try.

          Walt looks at Johnny, then back to Rob.  He steps back. 
          Rob takes Johnny in, smiling a death head's smile.

                                        ROB CIRILLO
                        Who's this, Bannerman?  Your

                        me?

          Rob's chuckle breaks up into a disgusting cough.  Johnny
          hands his cane to Walt.  He reaches out and takes hold of
          the heroin packet with his left hand.  He hefts it, feeling
          its weight.  Then, without warning, he reaches out and
          grabs Rob's wrist, holding onto both Cirillo and the heroin
          at the same time, we RAMP IN:

          We do this sequence a little different.  Staying on
          Johnny's face, concentrating, in the ZONE, as we smash

                        Black hair.



            A curtain of long jet black hair flips back, revealing a
          half Asian/half Caucasian WOMAN, 28, looking at herself
          in a mirror, wet from the shower, wearing a towel.  Her
          face is non expressive, which makes her that much hotter.

                        Raven black hair.

          Rob stares, intimidated, not sure what to make of it.

          CLOSE ON Johnny's hand holding Rob's wrist, (note a certain
          ring on Rob's finger).

                                                                                FLASH TO:          DEAD ZONE: PLAGUE - ACT THREE - 5/13/03 - PINK        45.



          wrapped around a beer (ring visible).  In the background
          we see the Raven haired girl, dressed in bra and undies. 
          She turns to walk away and we see a large butterfly tattoo
          on the small of her back.

          Rob starts to shake his head.

          Johnny gets another hit, catching him off guard...

          Another, less energetic hair flip reveals a shocking cut
          of the Woman leaning forward in the mirror, wearing only
          the towel again, but she's not pretty anymore.  She is
          sick, weak, and terrified.

          Navarro watches, along with Johnny, Pratt and Walt, as a
          body bag on a gurney is zipped open to reveal the D.O.A.
          flight attendant.  Everyone is wearing masks.

          The flipping photos end on a horrific image of a man, his

          Johnny slams the textbook shut, shaking off the image.

          Pratt and Navarro exchange a grim look. Navarro thinks a

  7575HALLWAY

          Johnny walks down the hall in slow motion.  Everywhere he
          looks there are SICK and WORRIED FAMILIES.  HAZMAT suited
          agents are putting up the plastic sheet wall over the
          double doors to the wings.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:



          Johnny looks in on the I.C.U. - J.J. has been transferred
          here, encased in a translucent plastic tent.  A NURSE
          (the one from Johnny's vision in act one) now in a BIO
          SUIT is drawing blood from a shunt in J.J.'s arm.  Sarah
          and Walt sit nearby, staring.  Watching.  Waiting.
          Exhausted.  Sarah looks up and sees Johnny, managing a
          weak smile.

                                        SARAH
                        I feel so helpless.

          Just then, the Nurses's beeper goes off and she rushes
          off to some unseen emergency, leaving behind the blood
          sample and several unused syringes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't you and Walt get
                          something to eat.  I'll watch
                        J.J.  It's going to be a long
                        night. 

                                        WALT
                        He's right.  You haven't eaten
                          anything since this morning.

          Walt helps a reluctant Sarah get up.

                                        SARAH
                        Maybe a little coffee.

          Johnny waits until Sarah and Walt leave, then moves to
          J.J.  He unzips the sterile tent around J.J. and reaches
          in for his arm, pausing just a moment before touching
          him... He leans down and whispers to J.J. -- it's so
          private, we barely catch it.

                                        JOHNNY

          Then Johnny touches his son.  Like a bolt of electricity --


  7777HE'S HIT BY A VISION

          In a SPLIT REALITY, Johnny's attention is drawn across
          the room by the sound of muffled crying.  He turns to see
          Sarah and Walt, wearing masks, standing at the foot of
          the bed, both exhausted, grieving, all hope now gone.

          Johnny turns back to look at J.J. in front of him, the
          tent gone, the equipment unplugged, a black body bag
          surrounding his lifeless body, about to be zipped up by a
          NURSE in full bio-suit.  She takes the hand Johnny is
          holding and gently tucks it into the body bag, then zips
          it up, triggering a moan from Sarah as the --

          He checks the array of monitors around J.J. - pulse, oxygen

            heartbroken.  Then something catches his eye.

          Johnny ignores them.  Reaching the table, he finds what
          he came for, the MICROBIOLOGY TEXTBOOK.

          He starts flipping through the book, but it's 900 pages,
          so he quickly abandons that method in favor of using his
          abilities.  Everyone watches in silent fascination as
          Johnny takes the huge text and sets it on it's spine,
          facing up.  He thumbs through the pages and divides the
          book in half, holding one half in each hand, almost as if
          he were weighing them.  He picks the left half, then
          divides those pages in half again, this time picking the
          right.  He repeats this process several times, until he
          has narrowed the 900 pages down to about twenty, which he
          begins flipping through hurriedly, looking closely at
          each one.

                        It's a Cantonese AB6 retro-virus.

          A loud CRASH draws everyone's attention away from the
          book, to Johnny, who has collapsed on the floor,
            unconscious.

          A familiar voice becomes audible...

                                        J.J.
                        Mr. Smith.  Mr. Smith?  


          JOHNNY

          Opens his eyes, trying to focus on the bright, blurry
          world around him.

                                        J.J.
                        It's me... J.J.


          WIDER TO REVEAL

          J.J. standing next to Johnny's bed - looking almost well. 
          Johnny's still groggy, not sure where he is.  Last time
          he saw J.J. -- they were both dead.

                                        JOHNNY
                        J.J.?

                                        J.J.
                        Mom, I think he's waking up.

          Johnny finally realizes where he is.  Overwhelmed, Johnny
          grabs J.J. in a big hug -- crushing him tight in a way
          only a father would squeeze a son.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're alive!

          J.J. is more than a little freaked by the display of
          emotion.  He's not frightened, just confused.  Sarah and
          Walt rush in.  Pratt and a DOCTOR follow.  They no longer
          wear protective gear.

                                        SARAH
                        Look who's awake...

          Sarah wants to hug Johnny but hesitates...  Walt however,
          can't restrain himself...  Before he can think about it,
          he wraps his arms around Johnny in a big hug.

                                        WALT.
                        Welcome back you damn fool.

          Now it's Johnny's turn to be more than a little freaked
          by an unexpected show of emotion.

                                        SARAH
                        You had us worried.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened?

                                        WALT.
                        You've been out for three days.

                        I'm not even going to pretend to
                        know how you did what you did,
                        but it worked.  After your trick
                        with the "Big Book of Germs", it
                        only took the C.D.C. 24 hours to
                          formulate a treatment -- and most
                        of that was spent trying to get
                        them to believe us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What was it?

                                        J.J.
                                (loves this part)
                          A mutated virus...

          He mock chokes himself and makes a ghastly kid face. 
            Everybody laughs.  It's a huge release.  Sarah is wiping
          tears from her eyes.  Even Walt is fighting to stay his
          stoic self.

                                        PRATT
                          A mutated retrovirus actually. 
                        It used a common enzyme in the
                        body to spread at will.  Luckily,
                        there's an anti-malarial drug
                        that suppresses that enzyme,
                          starving the virus.  The C.D.C.
                        would have figured it out
                          eventually, but not in time to
                        save these kids.  Or you.
                                (then sheepishly)
                          Listen... I think there's time
                        now for that apology I owe you. 
                        What you did is outside everything
                        I know as a physician and a
                        scientist.  But you saved a lot
                        of lives.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No apology necessary.

                        But there is someone who wants to
                        thank you...

          Sarah nudges a shy J.J. who stiffly steps forward towards
          Johnny, extending a hand to shake.

                                        J.J.
                        Thanks Mr. Smith.

          Johnny smiles and shakes his son's hand.  Sarah fights
          hard not to burst into tears.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Johnny...

                                        J.J.
                          ...thanks... Johnny.

          It's still formal between them, but their eyes meet and
          J.J. smiles -- a first step on a long road.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're welcome... Guess we know
                        what your science camp project is
                        going to be next year...

                                        PRATT
                        ...The effects of genetic mutation
                        on viruses?

                                        J.J.
                        No way.  Next summer I'm going to
                        swim camp.

          Through the laughter, Johnny and Sarah find each other,
          sharing the kind of private look reserved only for parents
          in a moment like this.  Sarah silently mouths "thank you"
          to Johnny.  He smiles back, and for just a brief moment,
          all is right with the world.

          At least until next week.
