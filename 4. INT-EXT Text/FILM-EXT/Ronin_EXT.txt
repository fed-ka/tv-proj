A PHONE RINGS, replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot
we expected to hear.
Rain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of
streetlight.
The source of the ringing.
We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the
phone booth, and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY
AMERICAN.
UGLY AMERICAN (V.O.)
What is this?
CUT TO:
The phone is still ringing, louder now, and we're MOVING
TOWARDS it while looking THROUGH AN UNSEEN PAIR OF EYES, and
even as we drink this in we're back in -
We're almost ON TOP OF the phone booth, the phone is still
ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone
from its cradle.
A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
(a touch Irish accent)
Yes?
ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see a woman named DEIRDRE on the
phone: striking, dark-haired, Irish.
She carries herself
with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar.
Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end,
and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE
stands in the shadows of the bar, watching Deirdre.
She
gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her
hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat.
DEIRDRE
Can I help you?
The silhouette steps into a POOL OF LIGHT.
This is SAM.
Tough, lean, enigmatic.
Somebody you might trust, but whom
you'd never cross.
Sam returns her look before he speaks.
SAM
No...
Sam moves towards the bar, and Deirdre returns to her phone
conversation.
DEIRDRE
I'm here...
(a beat, responding to a
question)
No, it was nothing.
THE PAY PHONE makes a sharp noise as it's cracked back into
the cradle.
Deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in
thought.
Then, without warning - Deirdre spins around,
pulling TWO GUNS from inside her coat.
The move is fast,
performed with the grace of a professional killer, as Deridre
scans the horizon, but nobody seems to be watching.
Deirdre
pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street,
the better to watch -
THE BAR - And as Deirdre watches the bar we watch her.
PULLING BACK from Deirdre, UP INTO THE AIR and then MOVING
THROUGH TO -
A DESOLATE URBAN LANDSCAPE - Sam and Vincent walking away
from the warehouse, which is housed in what looks to be the
toughest neighborhood in the city, filled with CHEAP CONCRETE
PUBLIC HOUSING and INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS.
THE SETTING SUN throws a red glow on the street, giving the
raw concrete buildings a blood-colored tint, as Sam and
Vincent approach a FIAT, a car neither too old nor too new.
Before they can reach the car, the two men are intercepted by
FOUR TOUGHS, young guys in their early twenties.
The LEADER
of the Toughs apporaches Vincent.
LEADER
(subtitled French)
Who gave you permission to park here?
SAM
(to Vincent)
What's he saying?
VINCENT
Pretty much what you'd expect.
SAM
(with a sigh)
That's what I thought.
LEADER
(in French)
There's a charge for parking on our
block.
The other Toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks (in French,
of course).
VINCENT
(to Sam)
He says this is their block.
SAM
As in, they own it?
VINCENT
Something like that...
SAM
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta
give them something for using it, huh?
VINCENT
I didn't know that you spoke French.
SAM
I don't.
But the language he's speaking
is universal.
ANGLE ON THE LEADER - Who's smirking at Vincent and Sam.
Sam's words make a great deal of sense: the Leader is
speaking the universal language of "give me some money or
I'll kick your ass."
SAM (O.S.)
I guess we oughta give them something...
CUT BACK TO: Vincent and Sam.
VINCENT
If you think we should.
Vincent backfists the Leader in the nose -- hitting him so
hard that the Leader skitters back on unsteady feet and then
sits down on his ass.
This blow hurt, but the real damage is
to the Leader's pride.
Now - One of the Toughs rushes at
Sam, only to have Sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw
which savagely jerks the Tough off his feet and flattens him.
SAM
(as if it were an accident)
Oh man, I am sorry about that...
(he sticks his hand out)
Let me give you a hand.
Sam reaches down as if to help the Tough, who ignores the
hand and totters to his feet.
As soon as he's up he turns
and runs away, followed by the other Toughs.
Now only the
leader is left behind.
He looks for a second at Vincent and
Sam, and then turns and runs after his friends.
Vincent
calls after him in French, but whatever he says isn't
translated.
Vincent turns to unlock the car.
SAM
What'd you say to him?
VINCENT
I asked if we could give him anything
else.
By now the two men are in the car, which starts up and drives
off, as it does we -
CUT TO:
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of the car driving through Paris at
night.
We don't see familiar sights like the Eiffel Tower or
the Arc de Triomph, but instead - We travel through the LEFT
BANK, down a series of Mazy Alleys which twist and turn,
filled with bistros, bars and falafel joints.
NEON SIGNS
line the streets for as far as the eye can see.
Near the end
of this trip we hear the SOUND OF A MATCH FLARING, followed
by -
SAM (V.O.)
Could I get one of those?
The Fiat pulls up to the curb and Vincent and Sam get out.
Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to -
AN EXQUISITE PARK, a small, perfectly manicured place -- a
kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere.
When Sam sees the park, he draws an involuntary breath.
VINCENT
Lovely, isn't it?
SAM
They'd have to keep something like this
under lock and key in New York, and it
would still get fucked up.
The two men enter the park, which is, indeed, open to the
public.
Inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost
invisible from the street, we see - FRANCOIS, a stubble-faced
tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth.
Vincent and Sam
draw near.
This next conversation between Francois and
Vincent is in FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES.
FRANCOIS
That's good right where you are, Vincent.
Vincent signals for Sam to stop.
Both Vincent and Sam are
still several feet away from Francois.
VINCENT
Do you have it?
FRANCOIS
Not so fast.
(nods slightly to Sam)
Who's that?
VINCENT
He's company.
FRANCOIS
(as if he recognizes Sam)
Bad company...
VINCENT
What do you mean?
FRANCOIS
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's
a cop and you better shoot him in the
fucking head right now!
Sam hasn't said a word -- he doesn't seem to understand
what's been said, but he has noted the urgency with which
Francois spoke.
Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT.
Neither Vincent
nor Francois pulls out a piece to shoot Sam.
Instead they
wait to see if Sam will respond in any way to what Francois
said.
The conversation now switches to ENGLISH, which (it
turns out) Francois speaks fairly well.
SAM
(to Vincent)
What's going on?
VINCENT
I just wanted to see something.
SAM
(that edge creeping into his
voice)
See what?
Vincent isn't going to answer, but the overbearing Francois
chimes in.
FRANCOIS
He wanted to see how you reacted when I
said that you were a cop.
SAM
(he can't believe this)
You told him I was a cop?
FRANCOIS
He asked me to say it.
SAM
(looking at Vincent, truly
pissed)
He asked you to?
VINCENT
I needed to know.
SAM
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
FRANCOIS
(to Vincent, in subtitled
French)
Are you ready?
Francois's French words give Sam pause -- he's wondering
what's being said, as - Vincent moves towards Francois,
leaving Sam several steps away.
The conversation is again in
SUBTITLED FRENCH.
VINCENT
(taking out an envelope)
Here's yours.
FRANCOIS
There's been a slight problem.
VINCENT
(immediately tensing)
What's that?
Francois gives the slightest of nods, indicating that Vincent
should look towards a place perhaps thirty yards away -
A COPSE OF TREES, where we see a SNIPER pointed a telescopic
rifle at Vincent.
FRANCOIS
(still in subtitled French)
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my
friend with the high powered sporting
rifle will shoot you in the throat.
Sorry to screw you over like this, but
the information you want might get me
killed if I give it to you, and that's a
price I'm not willing to pay.
VINCENT
(in French)
I take it you still want the money...
FRANCOIS
(in English, with a grin)
Of course.
SAM'S POV: Looking at Vincent and Francois.
The men are talking, and from here we can't really hear them
speak.
All Sam can see is an earnest Vincent listening to
Francois talk, almost as if Francois is giving Vincent
instructions.
Now - Vincent reaches into his pocket,
reaching for the envelope of cash he's carrying.
As he hands
the money to Francois, Vincent uses his free hand to pull out
his gun while - Sam already has his gun out -- somehow he
figured out what was going on -- and now Francois looks on in
stunned disbelief as -
Sam fires a single shot, hitting Francois in the shoulder,
driving him away from - Vincent, who now squeezes off several
rapid fire shots at the sniper, while - Francois, bleeding
but still very much alive, now has his piece free just as -
The Sniper, his gun firing wildly into the air, falls to the
ground, shot dead by Vincent, and now - Francois is drawing a
bead on Vincent when - Sam hits Francois with a fusillade of
bullets in the chest and now - A SINGLE SPENT BULLED CASING
flies through the air in SLOW MOTION and lands on the ground,
spinning around until it comes to a halt and - A HEAVY
SILENCE FALLS, as the last echo of the last gunshot finally
dies.
Vincent and Sam look at one another, see that they're
still alive, and then look back at - The two men they've
shot.
Francois isn't quite dead.
Blood bubbles from his
lips as Vincent leans over him.
Again, they speak in
SUBTITLED FRENCH
VINCENT
Where's my information?
FRANCOIS
(with a grim smile, pointing to
his head)
In here...
VINCENT
Then you better find it in your heart to
tell me, Francois, because while your
death is inevitable, it still isn't
decided how painful it's going to be.
A LONG ANGLE - Vincent whispers in Francois's ear, whose grin
blanches as he realizes Vincent means to hurt him.
Francois
whispers something back and then - BANG.
Vincent shoots
Francois in the head, killing him instantly.
Then Vincent
bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which Francois
had tucked inside his shirt.
As Vincent does this, Sam comes
up from behind.
SAM
Now would be a good time to get the fuck
out of here.
Vincent's Fiat is parked at the curb in front of this
apartment house.
Vincent and Sam exit the car and move
towards the house -- a silence hanging between them.
Right
before they go into the house, Vincent takes out the envelope
full of cash that was supposed to have been for Francois.
He
thinks for a moment and then hands the whole envelope to Sam.
VINCENT
You saved my life back there in the park.
I know this doesn't begin to make it
right between us...
Vincent's voice trails off -- he doesn't know what to say.
Sam takes the money out of the envelope -- half he keeps for
himself, the other he gives to Vincent.
SAM
What I did back in the park I did because
we're working together -- we're on the
same team.
(holding up the money)
This is business -- this is work.
We did
it together, we share the spoils, even
split.
Sam opens the door to the house, but Vincent has one last
thing to say to him.
VINCENT
I owe you a heavy debt.
Sam almost smiles cynically at this: debts of honor don't
seem to be something he believes in.
SAM
Whatever you say.
They enter the house and the door closes behind them.
A
second later we hear -
DEIRDRE (V.O.)
What'd you do with the money?
A CAR sits, cloaked in shadows.
Inside sits our friend, the
WATCHER.
Once again we see the Watcher's knife -- once again
he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he
watches the House.
It's dark -- a single light glows behind
a window on the third floor.
Sam's room.
Deirdre and Sam are not the only ones indulging in
extracurricular activities.
Up here in this rooftop garden
we find Swede and Gregor talking in hushed tones.
GREGOR
I would imagine that the great
satisfaction in all of this will be
killing the American.
SWEDE
(we know this isn't true)
I hadn't thought about it.
Understand
me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in
killing.
It doesn't bother me one bit,
but I don't get off on it.
GREGOR
A means to an end, is that it?
SWEDE
That's it.
GREGOR
(he rises to leave)
Then I guess we're set.
SWEDE
There is one other thing...
GREGOR
What's that?
Suddenly Swede pulls Gregor down to the rooftop with a harsh
THUD.
Within seconds he has his gun pressed to Gregor's
head.
GREGOR
What are you doing?
SWEDE
Don't cross me...
GREGOR
Nobody's going to do that!
SWEDE
Really?
GREGOR
(truly frightened)
I need you, Swede, I can't do this
without you!
SWEDE
(beat, then he puts his gun
away)
I just wanted to make sure you knew who
you were dealing with.
GREGOR
I do, I do...
Swede is now on his feet, walking away, back into the
apartment house.
SWEDE
(this is almost to himself)
Just remember it, then.
And he's gone.
And as soon as he is, we notice something
strange about Gregor: he's not the least bit scared -- he
laughs a little low laugh as we -
DISSOLVE TO:
GRAY LIGHT seeps in from the horizon, while inside in -
A DAZZLING OVERHEAD MOVING SHOT, establishing that we've
changed locales, moved to a place filled with sun and blue
water and reflective surfaces: the Cote d'Azure.
We start to
MOVE DOWN TOWARDS -
A TOPLESS GRANDMA reclines on a beach chair, soaking up rays,
sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a WAITER.
Nearby -
AT A ROUND TABLE -
A nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in, we
find our group: Deirdre, Sam, Vincent, Gregor, Swede, and
Larry.
Food and drink surround them.
Larry is, of couse,
still eating.
DEIRDRE
Now then, let's run through it one more
time, shall we?
(to Gregor)
What's your job?
GREGOR
I use my cell phone to get computer
access to the telecommunications
satellite used by our target.
I trace
his cell phone signature and use it to
pin point his location as he moves
through Nice, relaying that information
to you.
DEIRDRE
(to Larry)
Next.
LARRY
(a sigh, he's done this too
many times)
You call me with the target's route, I
follow along until we've reached the
attack point and then I run his squag ass
off the road.
DEIRDRE
(to Swede)
Which leads us to...
SWEDE
I ride with fat-boy...
LARRY
(under his breath)
Eat shit and die slowly...
SWEDE
After we stop the target car I get out
and use the heavy artillery to kill the
driver and his bodyguard.
LARRY
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
VINCENT
(picking up)
While Sam and I take out the back two
cars...
DEIRDRE
Leaving...
SWEDE
(picking it up)
...Leaving me to step in, drop the target
in the back seat, and get the package...
DEIRDRE
(with a quick look at Sam)
While...
SAM
(returning her look)
...While I back him up, making sure to
get the package if something goes wrong
and somebody takes Swede down.
Nobody else seems to notice this look between them, but we
should -- if only to note that there's something about the
way Deirdre queries Sam about his role, and something about
the way Sam answers her without overly reacting -- they're
not flirting, but there's a kind of acknowledgment of the
history they now have between them.
But -- nobody else
notices, and Swede's line follows Sam's without breaking the
flow of the dialogue.
SWEDE
Nobody's taking me anywhere...
DEIRDRE
And then...
LARRY
Then Swede and I split with the package
and meet you back at the rendezvous.
DEIRDRE
And then...
VINCENT
And then Sam, you and I clean up
whatever's left to be cleaned.
DEIRDRE
Very good.
Now all we have to do is live
long enough to get paid.
A ROW OF ROOMS, each one with a light behind a shade.
Even
as we watch the light in each room goes off: one two three
four five six lights -- one for each member of the team.
The
night before the big event nobody breaks curfew.
ACROSS THE STREET -
A BAR -
Through the bar window we see the Watcher's silhouette.
A
match flares as the Watcher lights a cigarette, REVEALING his
face for the first time: weathered, sharp, treacherous.
THE
MATCH goes out, and the Watcher's face FADES TO BLACK, and so
do we.
FADE IN ON:
A PRIVATE ESTATE IN THE HILLS -
A CARAVAN OF BLACK ARMOR PLATED CARS, all idling, ready to
pull out, filled with muscular men in suits with bluges under
their jackets, all of them waiting for - THE TARGET.
Except
we've seem him before and he wasn't called the Target: he was
the Killer from the first scene of the film: the gunman in
the cathedral who made off with -
THE BRIEFCASE.
Which the
briefcase is still handcuffed to his side.
Now the Target
gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in
the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell
phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does
we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as
we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and -
THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the
length of the town adjacent to the beach.
It's a special
place, a huge road for cars, along with a promenade for
tourists.
Here we come upon -
AN OUTDOOR CAFE -
Where we find Deirdre, a laptop in front of her, wearing a
HEADSET.
And, lest we think she looks out of place, we get
a look at -
THE REST OF THE CAFE -
Where many of the other PATRONS are typing away on laptops,
or chattering like crazy on their cell phone.
She types a
sentence on her keyboard, and as she types she says it out
loud.
DEIRDRE
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
CUT TO:
Where VINCENT'S FIAT is parked at a curb, Sam and Vincent
sitting inside.
A VOLVO idles, waiting for something, Larry behind the wheel
of this car, and sitting next to him Swede.
The DRUMS
continue to play, and their volume is still low, but they're
jarring, setting our nerves on edge.
Deirdre looks at her laptop and relays Gregor's instructions.
She speaks over her headset as if she's conducting ordinary
business -- as if she's giving someone traffic directs
over the phone.
The JAPANESE DRUMS continue, quiet and yet
intense.
DEIRDRE
You want to take a left, then, so that
you're going west.
During this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play,
building with the action as we do -
THE CHASE MONTAGE: A SERIES OF CUTS AS -
The Volvo takes a flying left turn -
Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards
the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his
keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a
bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as -
The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does
the same flight through the air and lands with a thud -
THE CARAVAN of cars -
THE TARGET CAR -
THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE
COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map
shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now -
The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build
to a crescendo as -
The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind
together, as -
CARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat,
which forces them to slam to a halt, as -
Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS
stop.
Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a
MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast
of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing
against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet-
proof.
The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the
heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle.
Sam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat, guns drawn, blazing
away at BODYGUARDS, and Christ, there's an army of them,
pouring out of Cars 3 & 4.
These guys are armed and returning
fire as -
Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's
got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER,
which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as
it scorches the air, traveling towards -
The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized
what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive
back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the
Car sideways.
Meanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other
Bodyguards, and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a
team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until
it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new
one.
And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray,
firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's
side so that Sam can run towards -
The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat,
pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death
himself as -
Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his
monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack
and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a
bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.
Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who
is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of
the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!
Sam fires,
winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and
still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits
Swede with the Briefcase.
THE TARGET
Fuck you!
SWEDE
Not today.
BANG.
Swede puts one shot between the Target's eyes, ending
his life.
Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO, the smaller of the
two traditional Japanese Samurai swords.
With one slashing
blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs
the briefcase.
The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the
handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride.
Now -
DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back
towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the
briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to
Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who
have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the
SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW
MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent
are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they
don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire
time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by
any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his
side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry
and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks
back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam
screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because -
Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the
protective covering of his bullet proof vest.
Now we're
MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup
piece drawn, a snub-nosed .38, and he fires all six shots
into - Swede, hitting him in the stomach -- it's the same way
Larry shot the target in the warehouse.
Swede is sent flying
backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.
For a second we
think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just
as Sam predicted.
Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he
too wears a bullet proof vest.
By now - Larry has rolled out
of the Volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now -
Swede has Larry in his sights, he's going to kill him.
SWEDE
I don't particularly like killing, tubby,
but I want you to know that this one I'm
going to enjoy.
LARRY
(sees something over Swede's
shoulder)
I don't think so.
Swede turns to follow Larry's gaze, and as he does - Gregor
walks INTO FRAME and puts his gun right beneath Swede's chin.
Before Swede can even compute this, Gregor pulls the trigger,
firing straight up into Swede's brain.
Then, without even
looking at Larry, who is lying helpless on the ground -
Gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the Volvo, driving
off just as - Sam arrives, kneeling down by Larry.
The SIRENS
get louder.
LARRY
(in shock)
He just...I don't believe that son-of-
a...
Vincent's Fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them,
Vincent and Deirdre inside it as Sam manages to get Larry
into the back seat.
Sam doesn't get in the car yet as Larry
says -
LARRY
(still having trouble believing
it)
We've been crossed...
The SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive,
charging with automatic weapons drawn.
Between the French
cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car,
and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE, pulls the pin, and rolls
it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops
have just reached.
Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting
off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to
the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.
We start to SLOWLY
PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the
shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking
hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street.
DISSOLVE TO:
The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets
in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old
City a coppery red.
We're MOVING THROUGH the Old City, through the twists and
turns of what an American would call back alleys but that
pass for streets in this place.
It is quiet almost deserted,
then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car
through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE
DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a
back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried.
Finally, we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING, and we
PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear -
LARRY (V.O.)
What is this?
We're on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France:
the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix.
Outdoor cafes line the sides of the street, while a canopy of
interlocking trees covers everything.
Now we're - MOVING,
DOWN THE STREET, towards a CAFE, where a DAPPER GENT sits,
sipping a mineral water.
The Gent has a SATCHEL at his feet.
Now - A JEEP pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in
neutral.
The Dapper Gent throws some bills on the table and
gets up, crossing to - The Jeep.
A door opens, and the
Dapper Gent, carrying his satchel, gets into the jeep, which
drives off as we -
CUT TO:
A FULL MOON casts a silver light over a field of wild grass.
A soft wind blows, and the grass moves gently from side to
side.
Now - Gregor's JEEP glides down this road as we MOVE
THROUGH TO -
A DARK STAIN splashes against the passenger side window of
the jeep.
Seconds later - The door swings open, and the
Dapper Gent's body plunks out onto the ground.
A moment
later, something wet and viscous plops down on the face of
the Gent as the jeep drives off.
Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT on
the Dapper Gent's dead body, which lies in the silver
moonlight, blood running out from beneath him, while the
Severed Hand palms the Gent's face, fingers splayed out
around his head.
Now - We HEAR the sound of PHONE TONES.
And not just any phone...
Vincent bursts onto the roof, gun straight out, finger on the
trigger, only to find - Sam is there, his gun pointed at
Vincent.
A BEAT, then both men give little laughs and put
their weapons away, like Samurai so trained in combat that
they know when it's safe to relax.
SAM
What's going on?
VINCENT
You weren't around when I woke up, I
thought maybe something had happened.
(off Sam's look)
This has been one very fucked up job,
Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances
on anybody...
(a quick beat)
Including you...
In answer Sam takes out Vincent's pack of cigarettes and
tosses them back to him.
Vincent looks almost delighted at
this.
SAM
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
VINCENT
You were smoking?
SAM
I hope you don't mind I took your pack.
It was on the table.
VINCENT
(very sincere, offering the
pack)
Please, help yourself.
Smoke as many
you'd like.
Sam considers for a minute, and then takes one.
Vincent does
so as well, and he searches for his lighter, which he can't
seem to find, because - Sam has it, and he lights their
cigarettes, and then hands the lighter back to Vincent.
SAM
(a shrug of the shoulders)
I borrowed that, too...
VINCENT
(puffing contentedly)
Of course...whenever you feel like it
just help yourself.
SAM
I have a feeling I'm about to start
buying my own.
BEAT.
The two men smoke in silence, looking out at -
THE CURVED SHORELINE OF NICE -
Which glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment
buildings, and a thousand more from the cars that travel on
the road that leads into town: the Promenade des Anglais.
VINCENT (O.S.)
That was a bad bit of business, today.
BACK ON Sam and Vincent.
SAM
It was at that.
VINCENT
A lot of people died.
SAM
I've seen a lot of people die before.
VINCENT
I haven't.
Not like that.
How do you
get used to it?
SAM
You don't.
You just learn to live with
it.
VINCENT
I won't lie -- there have been times when
I had to do it, times when the only way
to get out alive was to see that the
other man didn't.
SAM
We live in a singular world, my friend.
VINCENT
I never really thought I was part of the
world you move in, Sam, to tell you the
truth.
(off his look)
I'm a hood, a thief.
Big time in a small
time king of way.
To the local police
I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a
legend.
But to a guy like you I'm just
another two bit hired gun.
SAM
You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I
got a feeling you cost more than two
bits.
This conversation might have gone further, but it is
interrupted when Deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof.
DEIRDRE
Christ, I was starting to think that the
two of you had thrown it in and walked
away.
(to Vincent)
There's someone on the phone downstairs
asking for you, and my somewhat limited
French leads me to believe that he might
have something to tell us about Gregor.
A car we haven't seen before, a CITROEN, hums up the French
highway in the night, along on the road.
It's a postcard
moment, but only for a moment.
LARRY (V.O.)
I'm telling you...
Orange, pronounced "Au-Ronge", is a mid-sized town of fifty
thousand souls.
It is small, charming, quaint, and it has
one particular thing that no other town in France can claim -
AN ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER that has been painstakingly
restored.
We see this Roman Theater from the outside, as we
MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town, to the TOWN SQUARE.
It's packed -- every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled
with a tourist having breakfast.
This normally quiet place
explodes one month out of the year, when an internationally
famous music festival is held in the Roman Theater.
We come
upon -
A TABLE OF AMERICAN TOURISTS: a Family.
Dad is angry at Mom.
DAD
Opera?
This is an opera festival?
MOM
I told you that, Henry.
DAD
I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera.
You know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that
kind of thing.
Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them
behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a
cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.
Here, in the most
removed table in the entire Square, we find Gregor sitting in
the shadow of the trellis.
Unless you're on top of him you
can't see him, but he can see everything perfectly.
His cell
phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and
starts to punch in a number.
CUT TO:
THE CITROEN is parked among a number of other cars.
Sam is
sleeping in the back seat, while Vincent is seen on an
outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot.
Deirdre and Larry sit at a nearby picnic table, eating French
fast food, which we get a good look at as we - PAN THE LENGTH
OF THE TABLE, which is covered with pasta, grilled sausages
with dijon mustard, really good fried potatoes.
In fact, everything that's on this table is so far beyond the
imagination of your average American truck driver that Larry
can't contain himself.
He's stuffing himself, washing
everything down with the wine which is also sold at these
road-side rest stops.
Deirdre drinks coffee.
LARRY
(mouth full)
This...this is incredible. Is the rest
of Europe like this?
DEIRDRE
(with a laugh)
Some places, not all.
Italy, for
instance, they're serious about their
food.
But try bloody Britain, anywhere
in the U.K., you don't get much fancier
than a deep-fried bar egg.
Food's not
our thing, you see.
LARRY
What is?
DEIRDRE
(everybody knows this)
Best beer in the world known to man or
God.
LARRY
(with a snort)
Best beer in the world?
Budweiser for
me, thanks.
DEIRDRE
(with unconcealed scorn)
Budweiser?
You talk to me of beer and
you've the unbridled gall to mention
Budweiser in the same sentence?
That's
not beer!
Christ, it's not even a poor
excuse for rabbit piss.
LARRY
Oh yeah?
Whatta you drink, then?
DEIRDRE
I drink what every civilized man, woman
and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
VINCENT (O.S.)
I hate to interrupt a conversation of
such cultural depth...
CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent -
Who has finished his phone call and returned to join them.
VINCENT
...but we've got to get back on the road.
Vincent raps lightly on the car window next to Sam's head --
Sam's eyes shoot open: a light sleeper.
All eyes are on
Vincent, who waits for a BEAT before he reveals his news.
VINCENT
We've got him.
LARRY
I'm driving.
Gregor is seated where we saw him last -- at the little table
in the corner cafe.
He's been here for hours, observing the
Town Square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking
for - TWO MEN, definitely not tourists here for the music,
have entered the Square -- everything about these guys
screams GUNMEN.
Now, as Gregor watches - A PUNKED-OUT TEEN
comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope.
The
Gunmen look around the Square, trying to see where Gregor is,
but he's too far back in the shadows.
The Gunmen ask the
Teen a question, to which the Teen can only shrug his
shoulders.
Now - The Teen walks away, leaving the Gunmen to
open the envelope and look at its contents, which are quickly
read.
From OFF SCREEN we hear the sound of Gregor punching
in a number on his cell phone.
Simultaneously, the Gunmen
finish reading the instructions Gregor has sent them, and
turn around to face - A PAY PHONE.
The phone rings, and one
of the Gunmen goes to pick it up.
The Citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl, cruising
the streets, looking for Gregor.
THE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman
Theater.
The theater itself is almost two thousand year
old.
A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall, a
massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its
kind in the world.
THE GUNMEN enter at the bottom of the
theater, holding ticket stubs.
They are with a Tour Group
led by an ANCIENT GEEZER who speaks in rapid-fire French.
As
the tour moves off to see the Stage Wall, the Gunmen hang
back and then separate from the crowd.
THE CITROEN sits at a curb.
Larry sits behind the wheel of
the car, the getaway driver with the motor running.
Vincent
and Deirdre are already walking towards the Theater.
Sam
stays behind for a second to say something to Larry.
SAM
Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when
your partners come back out, you make
sure you're here with the motor running.
And on that note Sam follows after Vincent and Deirdre.
Larry doesn't notice it, but - THE WATCHER has found them.
He's a block or so away, wearing a two-day stubble of beard
and hugging the shadows of back alley.
Cradled in one hand,
barely visible but ominously present: his knife, which for
one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we -
CUT TO:
The Gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum-
like staircase.
Behind them we can see the Tour Group,
standing on the stage, being lectured to by the Ancient
Geezer.
In front of them the Gunmen find -
AN EXIT which leads to an interior hall.
Inside the exit
it's dark, while a bright sun falls down on the Gunmen.
They
look into the dark, unable to see a thing, while a voice
come at them from out of the dark.
GREGOR (V.O.)
Thank you, gentleman, that will do
nicely.
IN THE HALL -
ON GREGOR.
It's dark in here.
There are no lights, no
torches.
From the dark in here, he can look out and see -
THE GUNMEN, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by
the sun.
Now we CUT BACK AND FORTH between these two ANGLES,
and it becomes clear that Gregor has chosen wisely -- he can
see his quarry, but they can't see him.
GREGOR
Edvard, is that you?
EDVARD, the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen
responds.
EDVARD
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
GREGOR
I'm touched, really, that they'd send
someone of your caliber.
It's nice to
know that they didn't make the mistake of
underestimating me twice.
EDVARD
That was a mistake, trying to kill you.
Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd
have never allowed it.
GREGOR
I'm sure.
But I'm sorry to say that it's
too late for trust: we have a serious
problem.
EDVARD
We'll double your price.
GREGOR
(now that's interesting)
Really?
Do you have the money with you?
EDVARD
Do you have the material?
GREGOR
You first, Edvard.
EDVARD
Perhaps we could both go at the same
time...
GREGOR
(a short laugh)
I think not.
(with a flourish)
After you...
A GUN COMES INTO FRAME, trigger cocked, the barrel placed to
Gregor's temple.
SAM (O.S.)
After you, asshole.
Gregor stiffens, as we PULL BACK ON Sam, who has snuck up on
Gregor and gotten the drop on him.
SAM
You might have been one mean technical
spook, Gregor, but you wouldn't have
lasted a week in the field.
CUT TO THE GUNMEN'S POV: Looking into the Tunnel - It's dark,
they can't see a thing, but they've heard Sam's voice and
they know something's wrong.
EDVARD
Gregor, are you alright?
DEIRDRE (O.S.)
Gregor's fine...
CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Deirdre -
She's snuck up on the Gunmen, weapon drawn.
DEIDRE
(continuing)
...but I think you're in a bit of
trouble.
The Gunmen reach for their pieces and as they do -
VINCENT (O.S.)
Don't even think it.
CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Vincent - And his piece is also out --
the Gunmen are trapped, and they know it.
Now we notice that
- The Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are coming towards
us.
Meanwhile, back in -
THE TUNNEL -
Sam is grilling Gregor furiously, his gun still to Gregor's
head.
SAM
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what
I want to hear, understand?!?
You have
no choice in this, don't think about
winning, think about staying alive.
I
want the item, and if you don't give it
to me, I'm gonna kill you.
GREGOR
(a panicky hiss)
I don't have it with me...
SAM
Bullshit!
GREGOR
I swear...
SAM
Then where is it?
GREGOR
I sent it to myself in Paris.
SAM
Sent it where?
GREGOR
A post office box.
Suddenly Gregor runs forward, towards the exit.
Sam runs
after him, tackling him just as they reach - THE OUTSIDE,
where the two men roll into plain sight of - The Gunmen, who
are still covered by Vincent and Deirdre.
Now we notice -
That the Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are really close,
no more than ten yards away, as - Sam has Gregor pinned face
first on the ancient stone of the theater.
He looks up at
the others, and that's when it happens - Edvard looks at Sam
and recognizes him.
EDVARD
(stunned, announcing to the
group)
Do you know who he is?
He's with
Interpol, the Internation Police.
He's
a cop.
A SLOW MOTION BEAT.
Vincent and Deirdre don't know what to make of this, their
heads turn to look at Sam, and in this instant - The Tour
Group walks into their midst and - The 2nd Gunman reaches for
his piece and - Sam FIRES his gun at the 2nd Gunman, and with
the sharp report of the pistol we move back to REAL TIME, as -
The Crowd panics, screaming, and now Edvard is reaching for
his weapon, as - Sam shoots again, killing the 2nd Gunman,
and now - The Crowd is still screaming and running as -
Gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit, as -
Deirdre pushes through the crowd, and now she's made it into
the tunnel.
Now we go -
OUTSIDE THE THEATER -
Where Larry has heard the shot -- his piece is drawn, but
he's been ordered to stay in the car.
In frustration he
slams on the steering wheel, as we see that - Behind Larry,
the Watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as
we go back -
INTO THE THEATER -
Edvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many
Tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of
them, including the Dad we saw earlier.
Seconds later,
Edvard has vanished into the tunnels, and now - Vincent and
Sam meet in the middle of the crowd.
There is time for a
QUICK BEAT, while Vincent glares at Sam.
VINCENT
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I
should kill you.
SAM
But you can't.
And now Sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving
Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow
Sam into -
THE TUNNELS -
It's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena.
Except that everything here is made of stone and the only
light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit
openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide
just barely enough light for us to see.
Now we do a SERIES
OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running, followed by - Vincent, while -
Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a
dead end.
He turns around, looking for a way out as - Gregor
sees the final exit ahead of him as we go -
OUT IN THE STREET - Larry is still behind the wheel of the
Citroen, anxiously looking at the exit, not realizing that -
The Watches is almost on him, and now we're back -
IN THE TUNNELS -
Deirdre comes running around a corner, and now she's almost
reached the exit as -
OUT IN THE STREET -
Gregor hits the street running.
He doesn't notice the
Citroen parked ahead, because he's never seen it before, but
as he runs by -
The car door swings open and Gregor runs straight into it.
He smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured.
Strong Hands reach out of the car and pull him in.
It's the
Watcher, and let's give him a name now because he needs one:
SEAMUS REILLY.
Seated in the front seat is - A very dead
Larry.
Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.
SEAMUS
(to Gregor, with an Irish
accent)
If you want to live you'll do exactly as
I tell you.
THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW - Deirdre appears, exiting the
theater and running towards the Citroen as we go back to -
Deirdre has reached the Citroen.
She looks in and sees
Seamus and Gregor.
Lastly she looks at the dead Larry.
She
sighs in disgust, but otherwise doesn't react as if
surprised.
DEIRDRE
Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch
would have sufficed, Seamus, don't you
think?
SCANT SECOND LATER -
Larry's body hits the street as the Citroen drives off,
Deirdre behind the wheel just as - Sam and Vincent run out of
the theater, with Vincent helping a wounded Sam who bleeds
from the wound in his side.
They arrive at the street only
to see - Larry, lying dead in the street, even as the Citroen
speeds away from them, turning the corner before they can
even think to raise their guns.
VINCENT
That double-crossing bitch.
Sam isn't even capable of saying that much -- he just stares
after the departed Citroen with a look on his face unlike any
we've seen in the film: "how the hell did that happen?"
But
there's no time to ponder this because they've been joined by
- A COP.
He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts
drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless,
holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he
stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're
both pointed at the Cop.
LONG BEAT.
In the way off distance,
another siren can just be heard.
Sam and Vincent glare at
the Cop, who strains with all his might to control himself,
but he can't because Sam and Vincent are death waiting to be
served.
The cop knows he has three seconds to make up his
mind.
Two.
One.
The Cop puts his gun on the ground and
steps back, raising his hands in the air.
Now - Sam and
Vincent stumble into the street, and are instantly almost hit
by - A CAR speeding around the corner, its Driver oblivious
to what's going on.
The car screeches to a halt, and the
Driver curses loudly in French.
And then the next thing the
Driver knows - A Gun is in his face.
The door is yanked open
and the Driver is yanked out, as we -
CUT TO:
The town of Orange is just visible below us as the
commandeered Car drives up into the hills.
Vincent is behind
the wheel, while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat.
Gritting his teeth, Sam peels back his shirt to get a look at
- THE WOUND, and it's small but bad -- the ricochet ripped a
small raw hole in Sam's side.
The wound bleeds, but
moderately so -- no major organs or arteries have been hit.
VINCENT
That makes twice now you've saved my
life.
SAM
I didn't save your life back there.
Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save
shit.
VINCENT
You see it your way, I'll see it mine.
You need a doctor.
SAM
(hopeful)
You know one around here?
Somebody you
trust?
VINCENT
No...I thought I'd take you to the
hospital.
SAM
(sharply)
No hospitals.
I'll fix this myself if I
have to.
VINCENT
(he can't believe this)
Fix it yourself?
(a thought comes to him)
Why are we even doing this?
There's no
need to run, Christ...
(he can't disguise his disgust)
You're a cop.
SAM
Not exactly.
VINCENT
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
SAM
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have
busted you a long time ago.
This isn't
about you, it's about the job I have to
do.
VINCENT
And what job is that?
SAM
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to
know about.
I can't go to the local cops
-- they'd never be able to get close
enough at this point.
It's me or nobody,
and I've been on this job too goddamned
long not to finish.
BEAT.
Sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes, offers one
to Vincent and takes another for himself.
They smoke for a
second, before Vincent speaks.
VINCENT
It looks to me like we're all that's left
of our group.
SAM
We?
There is no we in my world now,
Vincent, just me.
VINCENT
I'm going with you.
SAM
This doesn't involve you, don't you
understand?
I can't even guarantee you
any money out of all this.
VINCENT
It isn't about money for me, not
anymore.
SAM
You don't have to do this.
VINCENT
(with great finality)
Yes I do.
Sam gives Vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief --
Vincent's loyalty and sense of honor is something he's never
seen before, and Sam can only smoke in silence and consider
this as we -
CUT TO:
The Stolen Car parks behind a BARN, and Sam and Vincent get
out.
Waiting for them is a friend of Vincent's - JEAN-
PIERRE, a Frenchman in his forties, hearty, burly, friendly.
VINCENT
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
JEAN-PIERRE
Hello, my friend.
(with a look at Sam)
He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
SAM
American.
JEAN-PIERRE
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we
see what we can do for you?
A STEAMING CUT OF COFFEE sits in Sam's hands as he lights a
cigarette to go with the coffee.
He sits on an ancient
chair, smoking in silence, looking out at - THE WOODS around
the house, and this place is postcard-beautiful, the French
Farmhouse you see only in pictures.
But Sam's mind is
elsewhere, he's staring into space, lost in thought.
JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
You're feeling better?
ANOTHER ANGLE - Jean-Pierre stands in the open front door of
the farmhouse, with a cup of coffee.
Now, Jean-Pierre moves
out to join Sam, sitting down on another chair opposite him.
SAM
(responding to the question)
Some, thanks.
Enough to move on, for
now.
JEAN-PIERRE
(pointing at Sam's wounded
side)
You should really let a doctor look at
that.
SAM
Soon.
JEAN-PIERRE
But first you have something to take care
of?
SAM
Yeah.
JEAN-PIERRE
Something important?
A thing that cannot
wait?
SAM
It gets done now or not at all.
Another
couple of days and the parties concerned are
gone where I can't get them.
JEAN-PIERRE
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs,
but I am the one who connected Vincent to
this job, his agent, if you will.
He is
one of my oldest friends and I owe him a
great debt, much like the debt I suspect
he owes you.
A QUICK CUT TO:
INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE
Where Vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit
a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from
outside.
SAM (O.S.)
Vincent doesn't owe me a thing.
Vincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards
the sound of the voices.
JEAN-PIERRE (O.S.)
He sees this differently, as you well
know.
SAM (O.S.)
I didn't expect that he would.
BACK ON THE PORCH -
JEAN-PIERRE
You suffered through an agonizing pain
last night, pain you could have avoided
by declaring yourself an agent of the
law.
SAM
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
JEAN-PIERRE
Not a word.
But no ordinary criminal
would have the extensive military and
medical expertise you do.
And so I place
the pieces of the puzzle together in a
way that makes sense to me.
You work for
some government agency and you carry a
gun, and in my world, that makes you a
cop.
And now Jean-Pierre produces a LONG BARRELED REVOLVER which
he places loosely in his lap -- a gesture which seems to say,
"you'd better explain things to my satifaction or we're
gonna have a problem."
Sam notices the weapon, but he
doesn't react overtly.
SAM
So this is what, a test?
JEAN-PIERRE
Call it a reckoning of character.
BEAT.
Sam looks at the Revolver again.
SAM
If I was healthy, I could take that away
from you.
JEAN-PIERRE
Perhaps.
But you are not healthy, and if
you try I'll kill you.
QUICK CUT TO: Vincent - Who stands inside the house, out of
sight, but not out of ear shot.
He's listening to
everything, and we notice that Vincent has taken out his
own gun.
BACK ON Jean-Pierre and Sam.
By now Jean-Pierre has raised
the pistol.
He doesn't point it at Sam, but his finger cocks
the hammer.
SAM
So what is it you want to know?
JEAN-PIERRE
I suppose I want to know how a man like
you is created.
SAM
Created?
JEAN-PIERRE
Perhaps forged is a better word.
Like
steel.
Like a sword.
You're a modern
Samurai.
I've spent my life around
extraordinary men -- men like Vincent.
But I've never seen anyone like you.
(beat)
I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes
with you.
SAM
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll
have to carry it for himself.
And I'm
not any kind of Samurai.
JEAN-PIERRE
You seem one to me.
SAM
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by
the code of Bushido, the way of the
warrior.
I'm just a killer for hire.
(beat)
The world isn't about honor, anymore.
It's about survival.
LONG BEAT.
Something in Sam's speech touches Jean-Pierre.
He relaxes his finger on the hammer.
JEAN-PIERRE
Survival.
I suppose that's as good a
cause as any.
BACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun. BACK ON
Sam and Jean-Pierre - And we're PULLING BACK, AWAY from the
Farmhouse, which glows in the morning sun as we -
DISSOLVE TO:
A BLACK COMPACT CAR sits in front of a Parisian Post Office.
Inside the car, behind the wheel, we see Deirdre.
Now,
coming out of the Post Office, we see - Gregor and Seamus
Reilly.
Seamus has a coat slung over his arm, hiding the gun
which he keeps pressed to Gregor's side.
There's no sign of
the Briefcase as Seamus and Gregor get into -
THE EIFFEL TOWER fills our eyes.
And then we PULL BACK TO
REVEAL that it's a tacky, flyblown poster on a dingy street.
And now we're -
MOVING DOWN the Street, until we come to a store whose sign
advertises in English - HONG KONG MOVIES.
The windows of the
store are filled with posters.
We MOVE THROUGH TO
The Customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes -- what a
great fucking deal he just got!
A few seconds later, Tony
comes out and locks up the store front.
He crosses the
street towards -
Vincent exits the shop and gets into -
The Peugeot sits, parked at a cub, a discreet distance from -
AN APARTMENT HOUSE: 35 Rue de Glacon.
We PUSH IN on the -
The Black Compact Car idles at a nearby curb, with Deirdre
behind the wheel.
She's staring so intently at the front of
the post office, that she's surprised when a SHADOW falls
across her.
She looks up to see - Sam, standing next to the
car.
Deirdre starts to reach for her weapon, but Sam cuts
her off with a word.
SAM
Don't do it...
Something in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she
backs off.
Now she and Sam exchange a long look.
DEIRDRE
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.
(she really sounds betrayed)
I can't believe I misjudged you like I
did.
SAM
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy
mission?
DEIRDRE
I'm a patriate.
SAM
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
DEIRDRE
Where do you get off saying word one?
All the time pretending to be one of us,
it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus
and myself.
And here you are so high and
mighty, like you're so different from the
rest of us.
SAM
I didn't say I was.
DEIRDRE
(she sees something)
Bloody fucking hell...
CUT AWAY TO: Gregor and Seamus are leaving the post office.
By now, Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor.
Unseen by these two men - Vincent is approaching from the
side, on an intercept course, his hand inside a bag which he
carries with him.
Now - Deirdre turns and shoots Sam a look.
He's still watching her keenly, and we can see that she's
aching to reach for her piece, but she can't because Sam is
still on her like a hawk.
SAM
Don't even think it.
He pulls back the folds of his suit jacket, revealing his
gun, putting his hand comfortably on the pistol grip.
SAM
I'd kill you before you had it halfway
out.
Vincent is closing on Gregor and Seamus, another ten seconds
and he'll have them.
Now - Deirdre looks back at Sam, then back at the situation
developing in front of her, and then suddenly - She slams the
car into gear and drives off, tires squealing while - Sam
pulls his piece, sighting down the barrel and - He can't do
it, can't shoot Deirdre.
Now - The sound of the car alerts
Seamus, who turns in time to see - Vincent, who is raising
the bag wrapped around his hand as - The car flies directly
at - Vincent, who if forced to jump out of the way even as he
pulls the trigger of the gun hidden within the bag.
The end
of the bag explodes in a burst of fire, but the shots are off
the mark - Missing Seamus and Gregor as - Vincent rolls out
of the way, just in time, while - Deirdre brakes the car to a
screaming halt, as Seamus pushes Gregor in ahead of him and
then gets in.
Seconds later, the car pulls out, even as -
Sam drives up in the Peugeot to Vincent, who picks himself up
off the ground and leaps into the car.
The last thing we
hear is the sound of Sam's Voice as the Peugeot drives off.
SAM (V.O.)
Put your seatbelt on.
CUT TO:
During this SEQUENCE, we'll JUMP CUT BETWEEN the two cars and
the streets they travel through.
Now - The Black Compact Car
flies down a small street, followed closely by - The Peugeot,
where Sam is driving as Vincent tries to steady his gun to
get a clear shot at the other Car.
INSIDE THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
What the fuck happened?
SAM
I don't know...
VINCENT
You don't know?
Bullshit, you had her,
there was no way out.
IN THE COMPACT CAR -
Where Deirdre is driving for dear life, while Seamus is
freaking out.
SEAMUS
What in bloody hell is going on?
DEIRDRE
They're part of the team.
One of them's
the guy I told you about.
SEAMUS
From Interpol?
DEIRDRE
That's him.
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
Why didn't you kill her?
IN THE COMPACT -
SEAMUS
Why didn't you kill him?
OUT IN THE STREET -
The two cars SLAM through the traffic, heading for a HIGHWAY
RAMP which appears now perhaps two blocks away.
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
(figuring it out)
You slept with her!
IN THE COMPACT -
SEAMUS
How is it these fellahs managed to get
the drop on us?
DEIRDRE
I told you: they're good...
OUT IN THE STREET -
THE TWO CARS have reached the highway ramp, and as first one,
and then the other pulls onto the highway, we PULL BACK AND
UP TO REVEAL:
THE PERIFERIQUE -
The massive and confusing highway system which encircles the
city of Paris.
Right away we notice that this entrance ramp
leads to a traffic circle, filled with various off ramps
which lead to no less than four different sections of the
Periferique.
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
(slamming the dashboard in
disgust)
You slept with her!
IN THE COMPACT -
SEAMUS
(lecturing Deridre)
You should have kill him when you had
the chance.
But no...
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
You put everything on the line because
you...
IN THE COMPACT
SEAMUS
(as if finishing Vincent's
sentence)
You slept with the fucker!!
ON THE PERIFERIQUE -
THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle,
while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the
roadways.
VINCENT (O.S.)
Fuck...
IN THE PEUGEOT -
VINCENT
Left left left!!!
Sam looks up and sees - Three possible ramps: one to the
right, one to the center, and one to the - Left.
At the last
second he takes the left turn as we go back to -
IN THE COMPACT CAR -
Where Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening
Gregor.
Seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in
the other.
SEAMUS
(waving the package)
This better be the real thing or you're a
dead man!
GREGOR
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
SEAMUS
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
ZING-SHATTER!
A BULLET blows a hole in their back windshield
as - The Peugeot is catching up, and Vincent is leaning out
of his window, firing away.
Now - Seamus turns to Deirdre.
SEAMUS
Lose them!
DEIRDRE
You lose them!
Deirdre swings the wheel wildly, and the Compact takes a
screaming turn, followed by - The Peugeot, and now they're
both speeding towards another junction, where several other
roadways of the Periferique run together.
Now we see that -
Seamus is returning Vincent's fire, even as - The Junction
approaches, and now - Seamus screams at Deirdre.
SEAMUS
To the right!!!
Deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that she's now
on an -
EXIT RAMP, going against heavy traffic.
Now -
Deirdre swerves her car around, side-swiping several cars,
but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along,
and now -
One of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down
the ramp, crashing into - The Peugeot, which grinds to a halt
as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained
by their seatbelts.
The car has stalled, and Sam has to
start her up again and slam it into gear before following
after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty
yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow
after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway
ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL
BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying
through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now -
The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent.
SAM
Give me a cigarette.
VINCENT
Right now?
SAM
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
VINCENT
(fumbling with a cigarette)
Why are you driving?
(rapid fire)
You're not French, you don't live here,
you don't know these roads.
Why are you
driving?
He puts the cigarette in Sam's mouth and as he does - The
Peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic, gaining ground on
the Compact, and now - SCREEEEECCHHH!!!!
About fifteen cars
pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow - The
Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and Seamus
breathes a hugh sigh of relief.
SEAMUS
About time!
DEIRDRE
(glancing in her mirror)
Not yet...
The Peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile-up, and it's
back on their tail.
SEAMUS
(practically tearing his hair)
Good Christ!
Can't you lose these
jokers?
DEIRDRE
(through clenched teeth)
They're good!
And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car,
and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun, even as -
Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters
in both cars, and now Deirdre looks up to see -
A FORK IN THE ROAD, and the left side of the fork is closed
off, blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE, and the
Compact Car is headed right for it, and now -
Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact
Car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the Barricade
rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre
slams on the brakes as -
Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in
front of Sam's eyes, causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the
Peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as
Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamus's seatbelt right as -
The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES, and
we're in SLOW MOTION as -
Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but
there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning
her, even as -
Seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the
windshield and flying through the air as -
The Compact Car flips over and over and over while -
Gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life
to the Briefcase, which he grabbed back from Seamus before
the crash, and now -
Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face
sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive
as -
Sam tries to control the Peugeot, which is in a spin on the
exit ramp as -
Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car,
carrying the Briefcase with him, as -
Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is
now - On fire, and now -
Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot, but it's too late to go
back, because -
A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident,
and it's too late to turn around, and even as -
Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it -
EXPLODES into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire -
Hits Seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second,
even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes
out - Rolling away with Seamus, who is now not only cut to
pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns.
Now Deirdre pulls Seamus over the side of the embankment,
right before the cops arrive, and the two of them roll/fall
almost thirty down a steep incline, even as -
Sam catches a quick glimpse of -
Gregor, scurrying away from the highway, carrying the
Briefcase, and now Sam has to gun his car and get gone,
because the Cops have reached -
The Wreck, which is quickly burning itself out, and as the
Cops look into the debris they see that -
THERE'S NOBODY LEFT.
Everybody's gone.
FADE OUT.
VINCENT (V.O.)
We don't have much time.
FADE IN ON:
THE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does -
A LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we -
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SAME RAIN falls, more of a steady mist than a rain.
The
mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which
shine from - THE CHATEAU.
Hundreds of years old, it sits far
back from its own MAIN GATE.
In front of the Chateau - ARMED
MEN.
Lots of them.
Whatever this place is, it's not one
that invites company.
Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the
Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding
environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private
gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has
it.
We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN.
Heavy, thick Russian, punctuated with words like "Da!" and
"Nyet!" -- making it clear that we've reached the address of
the Russian Production Company.
BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE
GARDENS, more everything.
It's well-patrolled, but there
aren't quite as many guards back here as there are out front,
because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress -
A WOODS -
A forest, really.
Filled with ancient trees, almost mythic
in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this
place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies.
And
in this woods, looking out, we find - Vincent and Sam.
Heavily armed, they've just humped God knows how many miles
through the woods to get here.
Both men exhausted from the
walk -- Sam from his wound, Vincent from his smoking habit.
They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes.
Even
though they're screened from the chateau back here, Sam
reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of Vincent's hands.
SAM
Not here.
They might see it.
VINCENT
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm
going to go out smoking.
(takes the cigarettes back and
lights one)
Besides, there's half a forest between us
and them, they can't see a goddamned
thing.
Vincent offers one to Sam, who declines with a shake of
his head.
SAM
Time to quit.
VINCENT
Just like that?
SAM
Not just like that... Just before I turn
around and it's six months from now and
the first thing I do when I wake up in
the morning is light a cigarette.
VINCENT
(obviously he does this)
What of it?
(almost to himself)
Samurai pain in the ass.
SAM
(he hates this)
Would you stop with that...
VINCENT
Why?
You've got more force of will than
anyone I've ever seen.
You handle a gun
like it's a part of you, you perform
surgery on yourself without anesthesia...
(quick beat)
And most amazing of all, you quit
smoking, just like that.
SAM
(qith a cynical laugh)
The mark of a true Samurai.
(seriously)
What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no
different than what you do.
We're both
hired guns, and this is a job -- like any
other job.
VINCENT
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is
a job like any other?
Surely, if you are
a hired gun, you realize that some times
you just have to walk away without
getting what you came for.
SAM
Because I don't walk away.
VINCENT
Why not?
SAM
It's the one thing I've got left to hold
onto.
(beat)
Jean-Pierre is one of your closest
friends, is he not?
VINCENT
Closest and oldest.
SAM
And yet you would have killed him to save
my life.
(quick beat)
You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that
I can't even remember anymore.
I don't
know that I ever even had it to begin
with.
All I know to do, Vincent, is to
finish my job.
VINCENT
And when you finish?
What then?
This
package, whatever it is, do you give it
to the CIA?
Do you really think they
deserve it?
SAM
That's a good question.
VINCENT
Do you have a good answer?
SAM
(he's really just considering
this)
No, I don't.
A TAXI pulls up to the Main Gate and Gregor gets out.
Attached to his wrist, by that same handcuff: the Briefcase.
Gregor is admitted by a Guard as we -
CUT TO:
Vincent's CIGARETTE is stubbed into a rock and the two men
rise with a slow purpose.
They exchange a look and then Sam
steps forward, leading the way
SAM
I'm on point, Vincent.
A WIDE ANGLE - THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -
Pure Kurosawa.
The JAPANESE DRUM we've heard before starts
to play again as -
THE LONG SHADOWS of Sam and Vincent come out of the woods and
into the brilliant light of the back lawn.
For one minute
they stand still, and among the many weapons that Sam carries
is a long automatic rifle, strung over his back, and in the
SILHOUETTE for one minute it looks like a Samurai sword.
Now
the two men start to move across the lawn, hugging the
shadows of the various statues and hedges, trying to keep
from being discovered for as long as possible.
BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -
GREGOR
(to Seamus)
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
SEAMUS
Figured enough to know there's an odd man
out and I'm looking at him.
GREGOR
I think not.
(holds up the Briefcase)
I have, of course, taken the precaution
of wiring the briefcase to explode five
seconds after it opens.
Unless, of
course, I deactivate it before it goes
off.
DEIRDRE
(under her breath)
That fucking figures...
GREGOR
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll
kill myself and whoever happens to be
near me at the time.
MIKHI
And more importantly --
GREGOR
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
BEAT.
Nobody moves.
Nobody speaks.
Until finally -
SEAMUS
It looks, Gentlemen, as if we're gonna
have to sit down to table and work out an
agreement.
Before this entirely too-weird scenario can play itself we go
back to -
THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -
Sam and Vincent are closer to the Chateau, moving in stealth,
avoiding any entanglements and then Sam turns a corner and
comes face to face with - A GUARD, and his gun is aimed at
Sam's head: Sam's a dead man as we go -
BACK TO THE DINING ROOM
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE splits the night, and everyone in the
room looks at one another, before Mikhi speaks.
MIKHI
What was that?
BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -
The Guard who had Sam in his sights falls down, dead, shot by
- Vincent, whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms.
Vincent smiles at Sam.
VINCENT
That's one less I owe you...
Sam smiles, but it's no time to get satisfied.
their
presence revealed, there's no point in moving quietly.
Sam
draws his weapons and as he and Vincent charge across the
lawn towards the Chateau while -
BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -
MORE GUNSHOTS from outside -- not a war, but enough to cause
serious alarm.
Deirdre, ever the soldier, draws her two
automatic pistols.
DEIRDRE
(to Seamus and Mikhi)
You two stay here and watch our mutual
interest.
She nods at Gregor and his Briefcase, indicating what this
mutual interest is.
Then she turns and bolts the room, and
as she does we're -
BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -
Sam and Vincent are running along, hugging the ground and
whatever darkness they can find, while blind weapons fire
rips into the ground around them, Russian thugs not even sure
what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as Sam
and Vincent hurtle towards -
A BACK ENTRANCE TO THE CHATEAU -
Some kind of kitchen storage area, and as Sam and Vincent
burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in
from an interior entrance, and this is it, Sam and Vincent
are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then -
They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol
in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when
he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only
when he has the target in his sights, while - Vincent fights
with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an Uzi in
the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves,
and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is
quiet.
Everybody's dead except for Sam and Vincent.
They
drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they
move towards - THE DOOR - It leads to two passages, each one
leading to a separate wing of the chateau.
SAM
Let's work our way through the building.
I'll take one wing, you take the other.
Vincent and Sam split up, moving into separate WINGS of the
Chateau, and as they move off Sam speaks a word of warning.
SAM
Watch your back, Vincent.
And then they're gone, and we're with -
Deirdre, who's running through the house, going from room to
room, and we're with her for a minute, the JAPANESE DRUM
starts to play again, and now it's joined by more and more
drums, and they continue for the test of this sequence and
suddenly - A HUGE BURST OF GUNFIRE is heard, dragging
Deirdre's attention towards -
THE BALLROOM -
And Sam's in the middle of a pitched battle with three
Gunmen.
He kills the first, and then the second, and then -
No third.
The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam
fires, the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide,
ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor
with glass.
And now we're -
ON DEIRDRE -
Running through the halls as we hear one last burst of
gunfire: somebody in the ballroom is dead.
Deirdre has
almost reached the ballroom when - Sam comes flying out, and
the two of them CRASH TOGETHER, sending the two of them
sprawling into - The shot-up mess that used to be the
Ballroom - And as they crash to the ground, Sam loses his
weapon in the fall, but Deirdre manages to hold onto one of
her two guns.
Now the two of them roll to their feet, and as
they do we're back in -
THE DINING ROOM -
Seamus the Madman is pacing the floor, his face even worse
than before: with each minute the mask of flesh that is now
his face is becoming more grotesque.
Little pustules have
started to form all over its surface, oozing a whitish
viscous liquid.
A NEW BURST OF FIGHTING SOUNDS can be heard,
and Seamus, who is no longer capable of thinking straight,
loses it.
SEAMUS
I can't take it anymore.
(to Mikhi)
Watch him, man, I'm going out and finish
what needs finishing!
And Seamus is gone, and so are we -- back to -
THE BALLROOM -
Where Deirdre has her two guns pointed at Sam and - Does nothing.
BEAT.
SAM
Go on, them...
But Deirdre can't do it.
There's something between these
two, and now - Sam looks around and sees Deirdre's other
pistol lying on a broken chair, and now he -
Kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg, causing it to
function as a lever, sending the gun - THROUGH THE AIR in a
graceful SLOW-MO arc until it - THWACKS into Sam's Hand.
Now
he's armed and he looks back at - Deirdre.
Her FINGER
tightens on the trigger, she's almost ready to shoot -- if
Sam raises his piece, he's a dead man.
DEIRDRE
Let it go, Sam, walk away.
In response Sam stares at Deirdre for a BEAT and then he
smiles an enigmatic smile and - He steps sideways, into a
nearby corridor, vanishing.
DEIRDRE
God damn it!
She runs after him but she's too late -- The corridor outside
is empty.
Now we're back in -
THE DINING ROOM -
With Gregor and Mikhi, and the tension is unbearable, because
they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and
then stops, but they don't have the least idea of what's
going on.
Still, Mikhi won't let Gregor leave without giving
up the Briefcase.
Mikhi has a gun on Gregor, who in turn
holds the Briefcase close, ready to open it and set off the 5
Second Timer that will blow it up.
GREGOR
(a feral hiss)
We'll die if we stay here!
MIKHI
(threatening with the gun)
You'll die if you leave here.
Gregor sits back down, fairly close to Mikhi.
Then, in a
manner so deft that Mikhi never even notices, Gregor extracts
a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the
Briefcase.
Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm
forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's
throat.
Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade,
already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the
slashed artery.
Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground,
jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up
the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move
to -
THE GALLERY -
Filled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200
years old.
This place is a maze, what with it's walls of
paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors
which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block
sight lines.
Now we find - Vincent, pressed against a wall, a
gun in each hand, while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting
him down.
We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split
up and look for Vincent, all the while speaking in low Russian
voices.
Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees -
Nothing.
No Vincent.
Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES
through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall.
It's
Vincent.
His hand wraps around Mafia Guy's neck, pinning him
in place.
Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the
painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.
Now - The other men
are alerted by the shots, they come running and - Vincent steps
out firing -
And now it's a bullet-fest, as he gets the drop on them,
using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage,
gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three, and then -
No four.
Vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where
he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT, hitting
Vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him.
The Last Guy has
the drop on Vincent.
Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty
little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A
BULLET bursts out of the Last Guy's chest.
It's Sam.
Now
Sam and Vincent exchange a look: Sam has, once again, saved
Vincent's life.
VINCENT
You have to stop doing that!
SAM
I'll work on it...
The two men don't have time for any more words, they move
from the Gallery and find themselves in -
THE DINING ROOM -
Where they find nothing but the bloody remains of Mikhi the
Gangster.
Sam and Vincent are surveying the room when a
VOICE comes from BEHIND them -
SEAMUS (O.S.)
Turn around real slow, and try hard not
to breathe when you do it.
ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus Reilly has come in behind them, and
he's got his gun pointed straight at Sam's heart.
If Seamus
is enraged at discovering Gregor's absence, he's overjoyed to
find Sam in his place.
SEAMUS
It's you...
(touches his face)
You're the one did this to my face, are
you?
SAM
That's me.
SEAMUS
Have a nice afterlife.
Seamus pulls the trigger and his BULLET spins out towards
Sam, ready to blow a hole through him except that - Vincent
leaps forward and takes the bullet -- it rips into his side,
a huge splash of red against his white shirt.
He falls to
the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time,
and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS
RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal,
taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the
table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV
showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then
suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other
- Mexican Standoff.
Suddenly, from Off Screen -
DEIRDRE (O.S.)
Seamus!
ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the
two men.
SEAMUS
Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking
bullet in his head!
Deirdre hesitates, uncertain.
SEAMUS
Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can
find that stinking Gregor, he's got the
bloody package!
For God's sake, you're a
soldier...
These last words sink into Deirdre: she is a soldier.
Her
gun swivels towards Sam.
SEAMUS
(sensing he's getting to
her)
You're one of us...You been born and bred
with your own people, you can't go
against your nature.
C'mon, girl, I'm
you're people.
Deirdre makes up her mind.
DEIRDRE
I'm no girl, Seamus...
She fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a
huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW.
DEIRDRE
And you ain't nobody's people.
She moves with Sam to Vincent, who is seriously wounded --
perhaps life-threateningly so.
SAM
(to Deirdre)
Let's get him out of here...
VINCENT
Finish the job...
SAM
And now...
VINCENT
(a commanding whisper)
Finish it!
Sam considers, but before he can make up his mind, Deirdre
sees something through the wreck of the Dining Room Window -
OUT ON THE BACK LAWN - We've already seen that it's bordered
on one side by the woods, for the first time we notice - A
LAKE, which laps against a PRIVATE DOCK, where a row boat is
tethered.
Now - BENEATH A VERY FULL MOON, the stark figure
of Gregor makes its way toward the Dock.
DEIRDRE
(calling out)
Sam...
Sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making
his escape.
Sam looks back at Vincent, who is almost passed
out from blood loss.
VINCENT
I'm really sick of you saving my life.
Go
out and get the bastard.
Same makes up his mind, and as Vincent passes out, Sam runs
out after Deirdre and towards -
THE PRIVATE DOCK -
And as the two of them run we MOVE WITH THEM.
DEIRDRE
He's got the briefcase rigged to explode
five seconds after anybody other than
himself tries to open it.
And now they reach the Dock and they find - Nothing -- no
Gregor.
And the Boat is still there.
Before Sam can
restrain her - Deirdre stps out towards the Boat.
SAM
Deirdre, wait up --
But it's too late: Gregor steps out from behind -
A BOATHOUSE, and before Deirdre can even figure out what
happened, Gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head.
His free hand sticks out and we see the Briefcase, which is
still handcuffed to his wrist.
GREGOR
You might have made a good field agent
you arrogant American prick, but you're
not smart enough to go up against me.
Gregor and Deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake.
This
Private Dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the
water is nearly five feet.
Sam has reached a position where
there is no right answer.
Still, he points his gun at
Gregor, who in turn shields himself with Deirdre's body.
GREGOR
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the
bitch, I don't care.
(beat)
And yet you don't shoot.
Interesting.
Put down your weapon and walk away.
DEIRDRE
Don't do it, Sam!
GREGOR
Shut up!
DEIRDRE
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though
me and kill this fucker.
SEAMUS (O.S.)
(a horrible croak)
If you don't, I will...
ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus is somehow still barely alive -- he's
not long for this world, but the will for revenge has driven
him this far.
SEAMUS
(to Sam, in a cold pale rage)
Shoot that traitorous bitch and I'll let
you live.
THE TOP OF SEAMUS'S HEAD explodes, finishing him off once and
for all, killed by -
Vincent, who has staggered out to make this one necessary
shot.
But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own
blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the
boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET
FLIES ACROSS THE SCREEN -
IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're
in SLOW MOTION as -
Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close
the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the
other, into the lake, while -
BABOOM!
The case EXPLODES, a flash of phosphorescent white
light that incinerates Gregor and the case and whatever was
inside it with an explosion that knocks Sam to the ground and
when the light clears - Gregor and the case are gone, while -
THE EXPLOSION ECHOES out over the lake, booming again and
again until finally there is - SILENCE.
Sam looks out over
the lake for any sign of Deirdre - But there is none.
And
then, after we've held for a BEAT longer than it should be
possible for her to have survived - her head splits the
surface and she emerges, coughing.
Sam reaches down to help
her out.
SAM
Are you alright?
DEIRDRE
Alright?
It's bloody fucking freezing in
here!
Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them
immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we
start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can
be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.
And we're STILL PULLING BACK ON -
THE CHATEAU - Or what's left of it, because it's started to
burn, and quickly the flames start to rise into the night,
like something out of medieval times as we -
DISSOLVE TO:
A WISPY FOG atmospherically rises off the river -- not too
thick, not too thin.
A TITLE: One month later...
We're MOVING along the cobble-stone walk next to the river as
a VOICE cuts through the fog.
VINCENT (V.O.)
Would you just smoke already...
A RIVERSIDE CAFE - Where Sam, Vincent and Deirdre are having
morning coffee.
A mostly-healed Vincent is smoking a
cigarette, trying to get Sam to light up.
SAM
I told you, I quit.
VINCENT
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate
smoking alone.
(turning to Deirdre)
How about you?
I thought all you IRA
types smoked.
DEIRDRE
Only the stupid ones.
Cigarettes kill
more patriots than bullets.
(a quick beat)
Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
VINCENT
So where do you go from here?
DEIRDRE
I don't know.
I was thinking...Maybe the
three of us might partner up -- guns for
hire, that sort of thing.
VINCENT
I'm up for that...
The two of them turn to Sam, but he shakes his head.
SAM
Not me.
You work too often with the same
people and you become friends -- clouds
your judgement.
DEIRDRE
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends
already we wouldn't be here now, would
we?
VINCENT
She's got a point.
(playing a trump card)
Besides, I know of a job that's
available.
Sam can't help it -- he's interested.
SAM
How much does it pay?
SLAM CUT TO:
SILENCE AND FOG.
A RIVER FERRY does a slow ghostly glide
down the river, and in seconds it approaches -
THE RIVERSIDE CAFE, which appears through the mist, looked at
by --
A SLEEK PAIR OF SUN GLASSES attached to a young PUNK in a
leather coat, and the Punk is looking at - Sam, Vincent, and
especially: Deirdre.
Sam looks up and shouts a warning as -
The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps
the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent -
PUNK
This is for Seamus!
BOOM!
The Punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as - Sam's
gun is already out, TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The
Punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the
Ferry which never stops as -
THE CAFE goes wild, CUSTOMERS running, screaming, WAITERS
dropping their trays.
But - Sam doesn't run, and neither
does Vincent.
Sam stands, stunned by what he sees - Deirdre
lies on the ground, hit full on in the chest: she's dead.
A
BEAT OF PURE SILENCE - Broken by SIRENS in the distance, but
quickly growing closer.
Now - Vincent looks at Deirdre's
corpse, then at Sam, who is unable to move.
For maybe the
first time in his professional career, Sam is staggered by
the loss of a life.
Vincent gently takes Sam's arm.
VINCENT
(soft yet urgent)
We have to go, Sam, we can't be here.
Sam looks at Vincent, and for a moment Sam struggles to find
something to say, but he can't find a goddamned thing.
The
SIRENS are getting louder -
VINCENT
(a little louder, bordering
desperation)
Let's go!!
Vincent literally drags Sam away and now the SIRENS have
arrived, followed quickly by - THE GENDARMES, who come
running into the Cafe but - It's empty except for Deirdre's
body.
Now -
THE STREET ABOVE THE RIVER -
Sam and Vincent are running through patchy fog, Vincent
leading the way, and now -
We're CLOSER ON Vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he
feels he's far enough away from the scene of the crime to
relax.
He collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving,
shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for Sam.
VINCENT
(thrusting the cigarettes out to
Sam)
Doctor's orders...
But Sam isn't there to take the cigarette -- Vincent looks
around, trying to see what happened to his friend, but the
fog has covered any sign of Sam.
Vincent stands there,
stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that
slowly falls back to Vincent's side as he realizes that Sam
has left him on purpose.
Then - Vincent lights both
cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the
stone wall - THE GLOWING CIGARETTE arcs through the air until
it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss.
VINCENT (O.S.)
Goodbye, Sam...
BACK AT THE CAFE -
The Gendarmes have secured the scene (there isn't much to
secure since everyone has run away).
A majority of cops
surround Deirdre's dead body, but - One GENDARME wanders
around the cafe, looking about, and then he sees something -
ON THE STREET ABOVE -
A SHAPE IN THE FOG.
The wind blows and the fog clears for a
second, and we see that it's - Sam.
Getting one last look at
Deirdre.
Quickly - The Gendarme points Sam out but as he
does the wind continues to blow and - THE FOG swallows Sam.
Seconds later the fog clears again, and when it does - Sam is
gone.
FADE OUT.
