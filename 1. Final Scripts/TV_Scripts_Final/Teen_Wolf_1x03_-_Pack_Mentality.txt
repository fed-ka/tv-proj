                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT11

      The school grounds lie dark and deserted. Under the 
      moonlight, two long SHADOWS approach, stretching across the 
      pavement toward a SCHOOL BUS. Scott and Allison appear, hand *
      in hand.

                                    ALLISON
                    Where are you taking me?

                                  SCOTT
                    Somewhere we can be alone.

                                    ALLISON
                    We are alone.

                                  SCOTT
                    Somewhere we can be more alone.

      Giving her a playful smile, he pries the door of the bus open 
      and holds it for her. Slowly, she steps inside.

      INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT22

      Scott leads Allison into the aisle and toward the rear of the 
      bus. He takes the last seat by the back window. She sits down 
      as well. In the seat across from him. He throws her a look as 
      if to say  Oh really?  But she s not moving.

      So Scott slips into the seat with her. She turns to him and 
      in the next moment, they re kissing, his lips over hers in 
      the back of the dark, empty school bus.

      His hands descend to her thighs, pulling her up to his own 
      body. Allison s fingers slide over the nape of his neck, her 
      back arching up, body pushing into his.

      SCOTT S HANDS grasp at her, fingernails turning to CLAWS 
      which rake her jacket, tearing at the fabric. He jerks back 
      suddenly, eyes squeezed shut.

                                    ALLISON
                            (breathless)
                    What? What's wrong?                TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/102.

        CONTINUED:22

      Trying to keep her from seeing his eyes, he pulls up out of 
      the seat.

                                  SCOTT
                    Get away. 

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      His eyes open wide revealing them to be a seething YELLOW.

                                  SCOTT
                    Get away from me!

      Shocked, Allison pulls back. In a flash, she s out of the 
      seat, trying not to turn and look even as--

      A LOW GROWL comes from behind her. She rushes down the aisle 
      as fast as she can when--

      SCOTT S CLAWED HAND snags her ankle and WHAM! Allison goes 
      down hard, eyes wide in terror.

      Hands now around both ankles, Scott drags her back, her 
      fingernails scraping the floor. But then she twists around 
      and kicks out--

      HEELS landing on the creature behind her. Staggering back 
      from the blow, Scott ROARS in fury, rattling the bus. Now 
      grown to a MONSTROUS black shape his eyes burn a vicious 
      BLOOD RED.

      He charges, massive clawed hands RIPPING UP THE BUS SEATS as--

      Allison reaches the door, pushing out. But she s stuck. She 
      tries to jam her way out, finally getting through, door 
      slamming open as--

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY33

      Stiles slams his Jeep door shut, slinging his school bag over 
      his shoulder.

                                  STILES
                    And then what? You killed her?

      Scott follows him from his Jeep toward the school.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know. I woke up. I was 
                    sweating like crazy and I couldn t 
                    breathe. I ve never had a dream 
                    where I woke up like that.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/103.

                    I have. But it usually ends a 
                    little differently.

                                  SCOTT
                    A: I meant I ve never had a dream 
                    that felt that real. And B: never 
                    give me that much detail about you 
                    in bed ever again.

                                  STILES
                    Noted. But I m going to take a 
                    guess here--

                                  SCOTT
                    I know. You think it has something 
                    to do with me going out with 
                    Allison tomorrow. Like I m afraid 
                    I m going to lose control and rip *
                    her throat out.

                                  STILES
                    No, of course not.
                          (off his look)
                    Yeah, that s totally it.

      Scott nods, head slung low.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    It s going to be okay. Personally, 
                    I think you re handling this pretty 
                    fricking amazingly. It s not like 
                    there s a Lycanthropy for Beginners *
                    Class you can take.

                                  SCOTT
                    Not a class. But maybe a teacher.

                                  STILES
                    Who? Derek? You forgetting the part *
                    where we got him tossed in jail?

                                  SCOTT
                    I know, but all of it--chasing her, 
                    dragging her back onto the bus--it *
                    felt so real.

                                  STILES
                    How real?

                                  SCOTT
                    Like it actually happened.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/104.

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY44

      Scott and Stiles search the corridor for Allison.

                                  STILES
                    She s probably fine--

                                  SCOTT
                    She s not answering my texts.

      Scott keeps glancing at his own phone, hoping for a response.

                                  STILES
                    You know, it could be a 
                      coincidence.
                            (considering it)
                      A seriously amazing coincidence.*

                                  SCOTT
                    Just help me find her.

    A hand comes down on Scott s back. He nearly leaps off his 
      feet. But it s just another STUDENT.

                                    STUDENT
                    Great game, McCall.

                                  SCOTT
                    What? Oh. Thanks.

      A 2ND STUDENT stops Scott.

                                  2ND STUDENT
                    Dude, you rocked that game.

      A 3RD STUDENT approaches with hand held up for a high five.

                                  3RD STUDENT
                    McCall!                TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/105.

      The accolades keep coming. Stiles notices, genuinely 
      surprised by the attention Scott is getting.

      But Scott s only distracted, desperately searching for 
      Allison, glancing from every and any female face. Starting to 
      panic, he pushes past, leaving Stiles behind.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/ADJACENT CORRIDOR - DAY55

      Around a corner, breath so heavy he s almost gasping, Scott 
      backs himself against one of the lockers. Anxiety rising to 
      anger, he raises his hands, fingers clenching together.

      He whirls around, SMASHING a fist into one of the lockers.

      THE LOCKER DOOR crumples like aluminum foil, swinging down 
      off its hinges. Strangely reminiscent of the bus door.

      As the contents of the locker spill out, a shocked Scott 
      backs away. Retreating around the next corner, HE CRASHES 
      RIGHT INTO SOMEONE.

      Allison. Her books tumble from her arms to the floor.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh my God.
                          (then with a laugh)
                    You scared the hell out of me.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re okay.

                                    ALLISON
                    Once my heart starts beating again.

      He kneels to help pick up the books. She notices his stare.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                          (with a shy smile)
                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    Nothing. Just happy to see you.

      So close they might almost kiss, Allison is about to respond 
      when a VOICE comes over the PA system.

                                  PRINCIPAL (OVER PA)
                      Attention, students. This is your 
                      Principal...

      Everyone stops to listen, hoping to hear school is canceled.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/106.

                                  PRINCIPAL (OVER PA) (CONT D)
                    ...I know you re all wondering 
                    about the vandalism that occurred 
                    to one of our buses last night. 
                    While the police work to determine 
                    what happened... classes will 
                    proceed as scheduled. Thank you.

      GROANS erupt through the hall.

                                    ALLISON
                          (to Scott)
                    Save me a seat at lunch?

      He gives a nod and watches her walk off. With a relieved 
      breath, he starts down the hall, but then pauses to see--

      Jackson at his locker. THE SAME EXACT LOCKER Scott punched 
      and left hanging off its hinges.

                                    JACKSON
                    What the hell?

      Jackson notices a guilty-looking Scott staring at him.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    What are you looking at, asswipe?

      Scott shakes his head as if to say nothing. Then hurries 
      past. Jackson grabs his locker door and begins trying to bend 
      it back into place.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CHEMISTRY CLASS - DAY66

      The teacher, MR. HARRIS, stands at the board writing down 
      chemical interactions while Scott and Stiles whisper to each 
      from their seats.

                                  SCOTT
                    Maybe it was my blood on the door?*

                                  STILES
                    Could be animal blood. Like maybe *
                    you caught a rabbit or something?

                    Raw?*

                                  STILES
                    No, you stopped to bake it in a 
                    little werewolf oven. How should I 
                    know? You re the one who can t 
                    remember anything.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    Mr. Stilinski, if that s your idea 
                    of a hushed whisper you might want 
                    to pull the earphones out once in a 
                    while. I think you and Mr. McCall 
                    would benefit from a little 
                    distance. Yes?

      He points to two empty seats on either side of the classroom. *
      Scott and Stiles stand and cross to their new seats. Scott s 
      desk is right in front of--

      Jackson. Scott sits, very aware of Jackson s eyes on his 
      back.

                                  MR. HARRIS (CONT D)

                    They found a body!

      In one motion the class bolts to the window to see for 
      themselves. Even Mr. Harris.

      OUTSIDE THE WINDOW - AN AMBULANCE sits parked by the woods. 
      TWO EMT s emerge from the foliage, pushing a gurney. Strapped 
      to it is a MAN S BODY.

                    That s not a rabbit.

      OUTSIDE THE WINDOW - The gurney rolls toward the ambulance 
      when suddenly the body atop it LURCHES UP.

      THE ENTIRE CLASSROOM SCREAMS.

      As the EMT's ease the victim down, Scott steps back from the 
      others. Stunned. Devastated. Stiles slowly approaches.

      Lunch trays in hand, Stiles and Scott head to an open table

      Stiles pauses with a French Fry held just at his lips. Lydia 
      is sitting with them. Voluntarily. He leans over to whisper 
      to Scott.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1010.

      Scott shrugs. Then Allison comes over and he removes his 
      backpack from the seat he was saving for her.

                                    ALLISON
                    Thanks.

      Stiles still holds that French Fry, watching with increasing 
      surprise as Lydia s GIRLFRIENDS, one of Jackson s lacrosse 
      TEAMMATES and DANNY THE GOALIE sit down with them as well.

      Glancing to the pretty girl now on his left Stiles gives her 
      a big smile. She smiles back. Then he looks to Danny on his 
      right. Gives him a smile too. Danny looks at him as if to say 
       In your dreams. 

      Finally, Stiles starts eating that French Fry, quite pleased 
      to see that the popular table has come to them.

      Until Jackson comes over. He glares at his Teammate.

                                    JACKSON
                    Get up.

                                  TEAMMATE
                    How come you never ask Danny to get

      The Teammate grabs his tray and gets up. Jackson sits down *
      next to Lydia and Danny. But his glare fixates on Scott. Not 
      at all happy this kid has somehow infiltrated his crew.

                    that there haven t been wolves in

                    True enough. But wolves are highly *
                      migratory. They could have wandered *
                    in from another state driven by 
                    impulse or a strong enough memory.

                                  SCOTT
                    Wolves have memories?

      He comes closer, trying to get another look at the camera s 
      LCD screen, but it s constantly just out of his view.

                                  DEATON
                    Longer term memories, yes. If 
                      associated with a primal drive.
                          (to Stilinski)
                    See this one here. Those are claw 
                    marks. A wolf would ve gone for the 
                    throat or the spinal cord with its 
                    teeth. 

                                  STILINSKI
                    So probably a mountain lion?

                                  DEATON
                    I don t know. A wolf could chase 
                    down its prey and hobble it, 
                    tearing at the ankles. 

                                  SCOTT
                    The ankles?

                    And then the throat.

      INT. HOSPITAL/FRONT DESK - DAY1111

      Melissa McCall looks up from behind the front desk as Scott 
      enters holding a plastic bag.

      She grabs the plastic bag and hurries off from the front 
      desk. Defeated, Scott turns to go. But then he looks back. 
      The only other person in the lobby is the RN tapping away on 
      her computer.

      Scott breathes in, head tilting up... He s caught a scent. 
      With a glance back to the RN, he steps away from the desk...

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - DAY1212

      Letting the scent guide him, Scott walks down the oddly quiet 
      hospital corridor.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1018.

      He stops at ROOM 137, finding the door ajar. He brings an 
      unsteady hand up and eases it open.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ROOM 137 - DAY1313

      Scott steps inside. Breath held tight, all he hears are the 
      BEEPS of monitors behind a closed curtain.

      He inches closer. Then, with a glance back at the open door, 
      he slowly draws the curtain aside to reveal--

      GARY MEYERS, THE BUS DRIVER. He lies unconscious in the 
      hospital bed connected to an IV bottle and a series of 
      MONITORS. BANDAGES cover his neck and chest.

      With a nervous swallow, Scott approaches, trying to get a 
      closer look at the man s wounds when--HIS EYES FLUTTER OPEN.

                                  SCOTT
                    Mr. Meyers?

      The man s breathing becomes harsher, gasps at his lips.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Are you okay?

      His hand LATCHES around Scott s wrist. The boy jumps and 
      tries to pull back. But the grip only tightens.

      THE HEART RATE MONITOR starts going CRAZY. The Driver s 
      breath quickens, almost hyperventilating as his eyes widen.

      All because of Scott. He yanks himself free just as the RN 
      and Melissa rush in.

                    Get out. Go!

      He backs away as they attend to the shaking and terrified 
      Driver. But the man s eyes are still locked on Scott, while 
      the monitors BLEAT their SHRILL ALARMS.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1019.


      EXT. HALE PROPERTY - DAY1414

      A BEACON HILLS DEPUTY SHERIFF CRUISER pulls up to the end of *
      the driveway, engine turning off. In the backseat a GERMAN 
      SHEPHERD pants, tongue lolling out of its mouth.

      THE DEPUTY gets out while speaking into his radio.*

                                    DEPUTY*
                    Looks pretty deserted. Does he want 
                    me to take a look inside?

                                  DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    Unit Sixteen, it s county property. 
                    Order is to make sure it s vacant.

                                    DEPUTY*
                    I don t think anybody s home.

                                  DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    For the love of God, Sixteen, go 
                    inside and see if anyone s there.

                                    DEPUTY*
                          (begrudgingly)
                    Copy that.

      The Deputy holds a nervous stare on the dilapidated house. He *
      glances around, noticing how utterly alone he is. Gathering 
      his nerve, he starts toward the house. Then he abruptly 
      stops.

      His eyes flit left and right as if he heard something. 
      Unlatching the clip on his gun, he starts off again.

      INSIDE THE CRUISER - the German Shepherd puts its nose to the 
      cracked window. It cocks its head toward--

      THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE - where Derek stands. His eyes begin 
      to fill with a BLUE GLOW, like florescent liquid pouring into 
      his irises.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1020.

      CONTINUED:1414

      As the Deputy cautiously approaches the house, a BARK makes *
      him flinch. He throws an irritated glance back at his German 
      Shepherd and waves a hand at it.

      BUT INSIDE THE CRUISER - the dog starts WHINING, pacing in 
      the rear seat. It lets loose a flurry of BARKING.*

                                  DEPUTY (CONT D)*
                    Hey, what is it, boy?*

      The barking turns panicky, the dog desperately trying to get 
      out of the car.

                                  DEPUTY (CONT D)*
                    What the hell...

      The dog s WHINES turn to YIPS, STRANGLED CRIES. 

                                  DEPUTY (CONT D)*
                    Okay, I m coming, I m coming!

      Now just as panicked, the Deputy jumps in, realizing the best *
      thing to do is just get out of there. Which he does. The 
      Cruiser tears off, KICKING UP DIRT down the road.

      THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE - Derek allows himself a 
      subtle but satisfied smile. Until he notices someone standing 
      amid the settling dust...

      Scott. He doesn t move to approach, however. Instead, he just 
      speaks...

                                  SCOTT
                    I know you can hear me.

      Derek s ears twitch as he picks up Scott s voice.

                    I need your help.

      FADE IN:

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY1515

      Scott steps inside. The house is a disaster. Walls blackened 
      by smoke and flame, rippled, buckling hardwood floors ruined 
      by water.

                                  SCOTT
                    Nice place.

      Derek stares at him. Waiting.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Okay. I know I was part of you 
                    getting arrested. And that we 
                    basically announced you being here 
                    to the hunters. And I also don t 
                    know what happened with your 
                    sister...

      He looks at Derek to see if he s going to fill in the blanks. 
      He doesn t. So Scott keeps going.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    But I think I did something last 
                    night. I had this dream about...

                    And it turns out that part of the

                    Then can you at least tell me the 
                    truth? Am I going to hurt someone?

      Approaching the bus--and whatever memories it might hold 
      inside--Scott pauses to look at the damaged door. He holds 
      still, drawing in a breath and closing his eyes--

      INT. SCOTT S BEDROOM/FLASHBACK - NIGHT1919

      Asleep in bed, Scott stirs. A distant HOWL heard through the 
      open window. His eyes SNAP OPEN. And they're GLOWING YELLOW. 

      Scott rises from his bed. When he turns, he s not quite 
      human, but not entirely werewolf either. A strange in-between 
      state...

      Scott snaps his eyes open. It s working. He reaches the front 
      door of the bus, steels himself and steps in.

      INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT2121

      Scott slowly moves down the aisle, hand gliding along the 
      vinyl backs of the vacant seats. DARK SPATTERS OF BLOOD blot 
      the windows. Looking down to the floor of the bus--

      He sees the image from his dream - Allison being dragged down 
      the aisle.               TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1026.

      But now it s the real victim - the Bus Driver being hauled 
      back, screaming.

      Scott grips the seats, the memories of what really happened 
      flooding in--

      In semi-werewolf state, Scott rushes the rear of the bus as 
      the Driver cries out in terror. A CLAWED HAND SLASHES at 
      Scott. He tumbles back, blood at his chest. 

      BACK IN THE PRESENT - Scott looks at the spatters of blood 
      around him. His blood.

      A BEEPING HORN snaps his head around just as a FLASHLIGHT *

      A low key place with a dozen lanes, moderately crowded. Lydia 
      and Jackson sit at a lane, putting on their bowling shoes 
      while Scott and Allison try to select a ball. Allison hefts 
      one after another, testing their weight.

      Looking like he s going to throw up, Scott takes tentative 
      steps toward the line. 

      Jackson watches, practically salivating in anticipation of 
      Scott s failure.

      Charging up, Scott releases the ball in quite possibly the 
      ugliest looking bowling toss ever seen by human eyes.

      The ball barely goes a few feet before clunking into the 
      gutter. He closes his eyes in agony at the evil LAUGHTER

      As Scott turns back to the lane, sound FADES AWAY. Brow 
      creased in anger, he takes a breath and launches the ball.

      IT SOARS DOWN THE LANE.

      Allison leans forward with sudden hope as Scott holds his 
      breath tight in anticipation and--

      THE BALL CLUNKS right into the gutter. No pins. Plenty of 
        humiliation. Behind him, Jackson snickers again.

                    up. Just clear your head. Think 
                    about something else.

                                  SCOTT
                    Like what?

      She darts back to her seat as Scott nearly drops the ball out 
      of his hands. He looks back to see her giving him a perfectly 
      innocent smile.

      When he turns back to the lane his eyes flick YELLOW for a 
      brief second as his anxiety completely disappears and his 
      heightened abilities seem to kick in.

      SCOTT S POV: his gaze zeroes in with sudden focus on the

      Scott winds up and lets the ball fly. The ball rockets down 
      the lane with almost shocking speed.

      Pins go flying. A perfect strike. 

      Scott turns to the others with a look of astonishment. 
      Allison cheers, clapping her hands.

                    I just gave him something to think 
                    about.

      Jackson reluctantly types in the new score as--

      THE NUMBERS on the gas pump tick up and up. 

      Noting the two men behind him and Argent ahead with almost 
      casual interest, Derek doesn t say a word. Just waits.

      He does notice one of the Hunters behind him, holding a 
      SHOTGUN tightly to his leg.

                    clearer?

      Argent sets the squeegee back, noticing Derek s hands have 
      curled into fists. Exactly what he wanted. But Derek slowly 
      relaxes his hands, unwilling to be provoked.

                    and me?

                                  SCOTT
                    I think I could totally handle more 
                    of just you and me.

                                    ALLISON
                    Great.

      And she kisses him quickly on the lips.

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison?

      She turns back and he pulls her into a real kiss. Hands 
      around her waist, bringing her close.

                                    ALLISON
                    And I think I could handle more of 
                    that.

      He lets her go and crosses to his bike which leans against 
      the rear of the Argent garage. Allison waves to him as he 
      mounts the bike and starts off. Neither of them see--

      Argent watching from THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW.

                    Scott, I m going to sleep.

      She peers into his room. It s empty. Obviously not pleased, 
      she turns to the hallway when a SOUND SPINS her back around 
      to--

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT39A39A

      The darkened room where a FIGURE tumbles in through Scott s 
      open window onto his bed. It s Stiles. He looks up and--

      Melissa nearly swings a BAT right into his skull. Stiles 
      screams, hands thrown into the air.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Stiles, what the hell are you

                    Can you please tell your friend to  
                    use the front door.

                                  SCOTT

      As she leaves, Scott notices Stiles s expression is far more 
      serious than expected.

4141EXT. HALE PROPERTY - NIGHT 

      The Hale house looms ominously, tattooed with ragged shadows 
      of the overgrown trees around it.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1047.


      INT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT4242

      The front door SLAMS OPEN. Scott stands in the frame, just a 
      silhouette.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek. I know you re here. And I 
                    know what you did.

      No reply comes from the dark shell of a house. Scott enters, 
      letting the door shut behind him. Head cocked, he listens. 
      Derek s calm voice comes out of the darkness--

                                  DEREK (V.O.)
                    I didn t do anything.

                                  SCOTT
                    You killed him.

                                  DEREK (V.O.)
                    He died.

                                  SCOTT
                    Like your sister died?

                                  DEREK (V.O.)
                    My sister was missing. I came here 
                    to find her. 

                                  SCOTT
                    You found her--

                                  DEREK (V.O.)
                    I found her in pieces and being 
                    used as bait to catch me.*

                                  SCOTT
                    I think you killed them both. And 
                    I m going to tell everyone. 
                    Starting with the Sheriff--

      DEREK HURTLES OUT OF THE DARKNESS. He moves like a blur, 
      sending Scott SMASHING into the wall.

      Scott hits the wall hard, cracking the plaster and falling to 
      the floor. He gets to his hands and knees, pulse rising, his 
      chest heaving...               TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1048.

      CONTINUED:4242

      And when he looks up, his eyes are YELLOW, his teeth grown to 
      fangs. The combination of rage and fear have caused the 
      shift. Scott is a werewolf.

      He launches himself at the still-human Derek. They collide 
      with a bone-rattling THUD. 

      Scott s attack is relentless and brutal. The second Derek 
      manages to tear him off, Scott is back on him, claws ripping, 
      teeth gnashing.

      They stumble and spin until both SMASH through--

      A BURNT DOOR, splinters exploding into the air as they tumble 
      down the stairs into--

      INT. HALE HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT4343

      The rotted and black basement. Scott SPLASHES down into a 
        water-logged floor. He pulls himself up, twisting around on 
      his back and seeing Derek through a MOTTLED GLASS PARTITION.

      BEHIND THE GLASS - Derek s eyes begin to GLOW an ice cold 
      BLUE. His body twists violently, head snapping back as he 
      TRANSFORMS, seeming to grow bigger, the mottled glass giving 
      a distorted glimpse of his metamorphosis.

      Frightened, Scott backs away as--

      Derek steps out from behind the glass. Far more monstrous, 
      more terrifying and clearly more powerful than Scott.

      Scrambling to his feet, Scott tries to run as--

      Derek grabs him by the nape of his neck, drags him up and 
      literally SLAMS him right back down into the water.

      Scott SPLASHES up, trying to fight back. But Derek swings a 
      CLAWED HAND out SLASHING through Scott s shirt and sending 
      blood flying.

      Scott falls back. And when he comes up out of the water 
      again, he s returned to normal. Gasping, choking on water, he 
      twists around, arms shielding his face as--

      DEREK ROARS, seeming to shake the entire house with his 
      furious cry.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1049.

      CONTINUED:4343

      Scott shuts his eyes, literally waiting to die. But when he 
      opens them again--

      Derek has stepped back. Breathing hard, he s reigned in the 
      animal rage, now back to normal as well.

                                  DEREK
                    I didn t kill him. Neither of us 
                    did. It s not your fault and it s 
                    not mine.

      Scott slowly stands, beaten and dripping wet. But his eyes 
      remain defiant.

                                  SCOTT
                    This... this is all your fault. You 
                    ruined my life.

                                  DEREK
                    No, I didn t.*

                                  SCOTT
                    You re the one who bit me.

                                  DEREK
                    No, I m not.

                    I m not the one who bit you.

      Scott gazes at him. Derek doesn t blink. No sign whatsoever 
      that he s lying. Scott s hand comes up to his chest where 
      Derek slashed him...

      And the memory comes to him--

      headed for the back of the bus. 

      Pressed against the rear door, the Bus Driver pleads for his 
      life.

      And between the man and Scott s POV looms his ATTACKER 
      silhouetted against the bus windows but clearly animal-like, 
      the low ceiling making its large size appear that much more 
      huge.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1049A.

      Then the black shape slowly turns to look back at Scott with 
      GLOWING RED EYES. 

      A CLAWED HAND SLASHES OUT at Scott. He tumbles back in the 
      bus, blood at his chest.

                                  SCOTT

                    Because he turned you. You re part

      Suddenly we re moving past them, out of the house--
