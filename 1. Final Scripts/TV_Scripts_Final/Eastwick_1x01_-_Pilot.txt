    FADE IN:

  ON WATER TRICKLING IN A LARGE BEAUTIFUL MARBLE FOUNTAIN... 
  THE KIND YOU WOULD SEE IN THE CENTER OF A CITY PARK... PULL 
    BACK TO REVEAL...

    INT. MANHATTAN PENTHOUSE -- DAY

    ...It s actually a rather small decorative FOUNTAIN, sitting 
  on an elegant table.  OVER MUSIC, a MYSTERIOUS MAN (we can t 
  see his face, just that he wears a GOLD RING with a D 
    engraved on it) stands over the fountain, he takes a SILVER 
    COIN and drops it in... We see a partial shot of his face, 
    GRINNING WICKEDLY, and then... we push in on the water...

    EXT. EASTWICK -- DAY

  And pull out to reveal THE SAME FOUNTAIN, ONLY LARGER.  In 
  the center of an old New England town square, near a sign 
    that says WELCOME TO EASTWICK.  

    Over shots of this quaint little seaside village, with 
    winding cobblestone streets, we hear the lulling, enchanting 
    voice of BUN.

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  From the looks of it, you might say 
                  Eastwick is an everyday kind of 
                  town.  Safe place to grow up, nice 
                  place to take a vacation.  Maybe 
                  even just a little bit boring... 
                  But you d be wrong.  Because if you 
                  look a little deeper, what you ll 
                  find here, is magic...

  We drift toward the perfect Norman Rockwell TOWN SQUARE, 
    where all of Eastwick has gathered for a festive afternoon 
    celebration.  A banner flaps in the breeze above the 
    bandstand, informing us that today is  Eastwick Founders 
    Day.   We float past kids flying kites and parents on picnic 
    blankets, colorful booths selling caramel apples and local 
    handmade crafts.  Don t you wish you lived here?

                                BUN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  Because this town was actually 
                  founded by witches... That s right.  
                  Real, honest to goodness witches. 

  We see some KIDS in PILGRIM COSTUMES playing around a 
    FOUNDERS DAY DISPLAY -- A WOMAN IN A PURITAN-ERA COSTUME TIED 
  TO A STAKE, LAUGHING, AS THE KIDS RUN IN CIRCLES AROUND HER, 
    TOSSING FAKE ORANGE PAPER FLAMES AT HER.                                                                                    2.



                                BUN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  That is, before they were burned 
                  alive by those nice pilgrims...

  We keep moving, past a  DUNK A WITCH  booth, where a WOMAN in 
    a WITCH COSTUME is dunked by a TEENAGE BOY throwing a ball...

                                BUN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                  After that, the ones who survived 
                  were forced to take their magic 
                    underground... So far underground, 
                  in fact, that their powers were 
                  eventually forgotten, or else 
                  remembered only as legend, or 
                  superstition... And that s why, 
                  today, nearly every witch who s 
                  born, doesn t even know what she 
                  is...

  We stop at a booth where ROXANNE TORCOLETTI, late-30s, sexy, 
    bohemian, mouthy, sells her art, which seems to consist 
    mostly of squat round goddess statues with big naked boobs.  
  She leans over the counter, resting on her elbows, her SHIRT 
    PULLS DOWN, REVEALING HER CLEAVAGE.  A creepy BROWSER GUY, 
    eating greasy fried chicken, GAPES openly at her rack while 
    holding one of her statues.  Roxie notices, annoyed.

                                ROXIE
                  Chicken hands.  Are you gonna stare 
                  at my boobs all day or are you 
                  gonna buy something?

    Embarrassed, he puts the statue down and moves on.  Roxie s 
  15 year old daughter, MIA, straightlaced and bookish, strolls 
    over, jumps up onto the counter, eating cotton candy.

                                MIA
                  I think the idea is to sell stuff, 
                  not alienate everyone who walks by.

                                ROXIE
                  Maybe I don t wanna sell my art to 
                  greasy tourist pervs.

  Mia picks up a statue and examines it.

                                MIA
                  Who else is gonna buy it, Mom?

                                ROXIE
                  Someone will.  I m not worried: I 
                  had a dream I was about to come 
                  into some money...                                                                                  3.



                                MIA
                  Oh my God for the last time, you re 
                  not psychic!  And if you are, 
                  you re like the lamest psychic on 
                  Earth.  Hey Mia, guess what, I had 
                  a dream that I bought milk and it 
                  came true!  Ooooooooo!

                                ROXIE
                  Hey, that really happened!

    Roxie sees a MAN walk by, she DUCKS down behind the counter, 
    nervous.  Mia leans her head down to look at her mom.

                                MIA
                  Why are you hiding from Homer 
                  Perley?

                                ROXIE
                  I just... owe him a tiny bit of 
                  rent money on the store and he s 
                  been up my ass about it all week...

                                MIA
                  What s a tiny bit?

                                ROXIE
                  -Just a... couple months.  You know 
                  -- one or two.  Or six or eight... 
                        (off Mia s look)
                  Well it was either that or eat, 
                  Mia.  I chose eat!  Call me crazy. 

    Roxie notices something on the ground.  A SHINY COIN.  It 
    looks just like the one we saw get dropped in the fountain 
    earlier.  She picks it up, it glints in the sunlight.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  I was right!  Fifty cents, baby.

    Roxie stands up, dusts herself off.  Mia s panicked.

                                MIA
                  Are we gonna have to become hobos?  

                                ROXIE
                  Will you let me worry about that?  
                  Be a kid.  Chase boys!  Sneak out 
                  of the house!  Go crazy!  Rebel!

                                MIA
                  It s not rebelling if you tell me 
                  to do it...                                                                                  4.



                                ROXIE
                  Yeah, but it s still fun...

    Just then, a gorgeous piece of strapping man-candy, CHAD, 24, 
  dim but sweet as a puppy, LEAPS OVER the counter and sweeps 
    Roxie into his arms, kissing her passionately.

                                CHAD
                  Mmm.  You look good enough to eat.

    Roxie is a embarrassed.  Mia rolls her eyes, as she spots, 
    ACROSS THE PICNIC, a GREASY, DANGEROUS-LOOKING BOY, smoking a 
    cigarette, leaning against a motorcycle.  She hops away in a 
    hurry to talk to him, Roxie doesn t notice, she s busy with 
    Chad, he s got his arms all over her, excited, she squirms.  

                                ROXIE
                  I thought we agreed on discretion-

                                CHAD
                  I got news, babe.  We re not doin  
                  anything wrong.  And no one s 
                  looking.  No one cares.  No one s 
                  talking about us.  I promise...

  She smiles, reassured, he gives her a kiss, as...

  KAT ROUGEMENT, late 20s, beautiful, dishevelled, but good-
    natured, walks by, carrying a PICNIC BASKET, with her FIVE 
    YOUNG TOW-HEADED KIDS and tattooed husband RAYMOND, drinking 
    a beer.  Raymond spies Roxie and Chad, turns to Kat.

                                RAYMOND
                  Man, that Roxie Torcoletti sure is 
                    a cradle-robbing slut.

                                KAT
                  Raymond, be nice.  She s a widow.

                                RAYMOND
                   Cause she killed the poor bastard.

                                KAT
                  That s just a rumor.

  Kat picks a spot to spread out a picnic blanket. 

                                RAYMOND
                   Prolly true, though.  And she s 
                  still a slut either way...

  One of Kat s kids starts running in a circle, tapping her 
    siblings  and parents  heads (like Duck Duck Goose) chanting-                                                                                  5.



                                KAT S KID
                  Slut!  Slut!  Slut!  Slut!  Slut!

                                KAT
                      (to Raymond)
                  Thank you, for that.

                                KAT S KID
                        (hitting Raymond s head)
                  Goose!
                      (he doesn t move)
                  Daddy, you re supposed to chase me.

                                RAYMOND
                  Daddy will, honey, soon as he 
                  finishes his beer.

  Kat shoots him a look, as she kneels on the blanket, pulling 
    loads of FRESH PRODUCE from a picnic basket.

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  Being a witch, you see, is a sort 
                  of a talent.  Like a nice singing 
                  voice, or being able to tie a 
                  cherry stem into a knot with your 
                  tongue.  Nobody really knows where 
                  it comes from.  Might be genetic, 
                  could be a fluke...

                                RAYMOND
                  Jesus, Kat, more goddam tomatoes? 

                                KAT
                  They won t stop growing...

  Kat notices one of the KIDS has picked up a SHINY COIN, and 
  is sucking on it.  Kat makes a face, and takes the coin.  
    It s another FIFTY CENT PIECE.  It glints in the sunlight. 
    Raymond pops open another beer.

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  Raymond!  You promised you wouldn t 
                  get drunk today!

                                RAYMOND
                  I m not.  It s only my fourth.  
                  I ve barely got a buzz on... Jeez.  
                  Lighten up, Kitty-Kat.

  He kisses her cheek, Kat sighs, we follow one of her 
    screaming kids, meandering through the crowd...                                                                                  6.



                                BUN (V.O.)
                  Born witches may suspect there s 
                  something a bit  off  about them...

  The kid whizzes past JOANNA FRANKEL, early to mid-thirties, 
    hair pulled back in a severe bun, wire-rim glasses, tightly 
    wound, nearly knocking her down.  She s at a stand selling 
    jewelry, where PENNY, mid-30s, quietly judgemental, browses.  

                                PENNY
                  Do these earrings make me look fat?

                                JOANNA
                  Do you think I should just pitch 
                  that corruption story to Clyde?  

                                PENNY
                  Yes.  For the last time...

                                JOANNA
                  But he s just gonna say no.  

                                PENNY
                  How would you know?  You never ask!  
                  You never speak up-

                                JOANNA
                  I don t need to ask.  He doesn t 
                  believe I can do serious stories.  
                  He thinks I m only good for writing 
                  fluff...  Well, that and 
                     accidentally  brushing up against 
                  my boobs in the coffee room.

                                PENNY
                  I know.  He does that to me too.  
                  And then he tries to play it off-

                                  JOANNA/PENNY
                   Tight squeeze in here! 

                                JOANNA
                  He doesn t respect me.  He s never 
                  gonna promote me.  Maybe I should 
                  just quit...

                                PENNY
                  Except if you quit, you won t be 
                  able to torture yourself everyday, 
                  pining over Will.

                                JOANNA
                  I don t pine.                                                                                    7.



                                PENNY
                          (disapproving whisper)
                  You named your vibrator after him-

                                JOANNA
                  My vibrator is only named Will 
                  because I thought it looked like a-  

  She looks up and notices a sensitive, thirtysomething HOTTIE 
    hipster standing there, at the same booth, staring at them 
    with surprise, a camera slung around his neck.  

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  -Will.  Hi...

                                WILL
                  Uh... hi... 

    He s embarrassed, she s mortified, can t look him in the eye.

                                JOANNA
                  -We were just... talking about... 
                  vibrators... 

    Will is somewhat stunned.  Unsure of how to react.

                                WILL
                  Oh.  Yeah.  I... heard.

                                JOANNA
                  -Mine is named Will.  For Will 
                  Ferrell.  The actor.  He s sexy, I 
                  think... 

                                WILL
                  Mm-hm, he s really got something.

    More silence.  Joanna is dying.  Will tries to rescue her.

                                WILL (CONT D)
                  So... I got some great pictures, 
                  for your article-

                                JOANNA
                  -I m not like a weirdo sex fiend.  Or 
                  anything.  I only have a vibrator 
                  because -- there was this 
                  bachelorette party and it was in a 
                  gift bag and I ll admit I was curious-

                                PENNY
                  -Stop talking.                                                                                  8.



                                JOANNA
                  -Anyway, I have to -- be over there 
                  now.  For quotes.  And... stuff.  

    Joanna grabs Penny by the arm and drags her away.  Will 
    watches, bemused.  Penny s mouth is hanging open.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  Be honest.  How bad?  

                                PENNY
                  Next time, maybe don t use the word 
                   vibrator  so much...

                                JOANNA
                  Oh my God, why can t I be a 
                  completely different person?  I 
                  just want to be a completely 
                  different person-

    Something DROPS FROM THE SKY, BONKING JOANNA ON THE HEAD.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  Ow!

  She kneels down to pick it up.  It s a FIFTY CENT PIECE. It 
    glints in the sun.  She can t figure out where it came from.

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  These witches might sense that 
                  their lives are full of strange 
                    synchronicities, odd, enchanted 
                  happenings -- but they write them 
                  off as mere coincidence, products 
                  of an overactive imagination... 

    Joanna stares at the coin, as they walk.

                                PENNY 
                  So you wanna come over tonight?  
                  Cry into a bottle of wine, watch a 
                  sappy old movie?

                                JOANNA
                  What?  Oh, yeah, sure...

    They walk on, Joanna staring at the coin, past ROXIE AND 
    CHAD, walking through the crowd, we turn and follow them.

                                CHAD
                  Dude, I m gonna hit the ultimate 
                  fris!  Later: you, me, nookie...?                                                                                    9.



  He kisses her, and off he goes.  Roxie watches him, sighing.

                                ROXIE
                  Sure thing... dude...

  She walk past Kat on her blanket, overwhelmed with kids...

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  We re not as tuned in anymore, to the 
                  magic that s all around us, that s a 
                  part of the natural world...

    Roxie reaches a booth labeled  Eastwick Historical Society,  
    where a group of kids sits on the ground, staring up at 
    beautiful, confident, BUN, on a folding chair, holding court, 
    like it s story hour at the library.  Roxie smiles, stops and 
    listens.  Bun waves to her, she waves back.

                                BUN (CONT D)
                  But it s there, always there.  In 
                  fact, some of you might just have the 
                  gift, and not even know it... Your 
                  power might be sleeping inside you, 
                  ready to wake up, when the time is 
                  right -- when you least expect it!

  Bun makes a dramatic gesture with her CHEAP PLASTIC  MAGIC  
    WAND, the kids all say:

                                KIDS
                  Ooooooooo!

    Roxie shakes her head at this nonsense, and moves on... She 
    reaches the FOUNTAIN.  Takes the COIN from her pocket and 
    rubs her fingers over it.  Joanna passes by, with Penny.

                                PENNY
                  God, there s Roxie Torcoletti, the 
                  merry widow.  I can t believe they 
                  let her sell her so-called  art  
                  here.  Around children- 

    Joanna remembers the coin in her pocket.

                                JOANNA
                  Hey, I m gonna make a wish.  You 
                  wanna make a wish?

                                PENNY
                  No.  It s kind of a waste of-

                                JOANNA
                  -I ll be right back-                                                                                  10.



    Joanna trots over to the fountain, leaving Penny annoyed.

    Roxie stares down into the water, still holding her coin.  
    Joanna takes out her coin.  They nod to each other politely.  
    Joanna closes her eyes to focus on her wish.

  Kat approaches, kid on her hip, wriggling, screaming.

                                KAT S KID
                  Ice cream ice cream ice cream!

                                KAT
                  Just let Mommy make one quick wish- 

                                KAT S KID
                        (pointing at Roxie, happy)
                  Slut!

    Roxie is surprised.  Kat s embarrassed.

                                KAT
                  No, honey.  That s a fountain...

    Roxie raises an eyebrow, goes back to her wish.  Kat gets out 
  her coin, closes her eyes to make a quick wish, and then 
    TOSSES IT, just as Roxie, eyes closed, throws in hers, and 
    Joanna too, her eyes also closed.  The coins seem to SLOW 
    DOWN IN MID-AIR, COLLIDING WITH A DIIIIIINNNNNG! BEFORE THEY 
    FALL SPINNING INTO THE WATER WITH A PLUNK.  A STRONG WIND 
    KICKS UP AND BLOWS THE WOMEN S HAIR AROUND.  They exchange 
    freaked out looks, but then the wind stops just as suddenly.  

                                BUN (V.O.)
                  And it will change your life forever.  
                  Like a coin dropped in a fountain-

    INT. MANHATTAN PENTHOUSE -- SAME

  The Mysterious Man with the gold D ring is smiling.  We can t 
  see his whole face.  There s a RED CANDLE on the table 
    bearing the label EASTWICK CANDLE COMPANY.  He lights it.  
  The wax melts at a supernaturally high rate of speed, 
    trickling down the sides -- it looks like little red ants.

                                BUN (O.S.)
                  -When your power awakens, it ripples 
                  through everything... It brings out the 
                  best, and the worst.  Chaos, temptation- 

    EXT. BUN S BOOTH -- SAME

    Bun s feet are unknowingly planted in a RED ANT HILL.  The 
    ants are beginning to climb up her shoes...                                                                                  11.



                                BUN
                  -They will ride into town on the 
                  back of the wind...

    A WIND BLOWS THROUGH THE BOOTH, Bun sits up straighter.  She 
    breathes in quickly, as if realizing something.

                                BUN (CONT D)
                  Oh my...! 

  Bun looks down, HER LEGS ARE COVERED IN RED ANTS, SWARMING 
    EVER UPWARD.  Her eyes widen, in horror-

    EXT. FOUNTAIN -- SAME

    Roxie, Kat, and Joanna stand around the fountain.  There s a 
    sudden BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM, they turn in surprise-

    OPENING CREDITS

    INT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

    Roxie sits in the waiting room, worried, in tears, Joanna 
    walks over with a cup of coffee for each of them.

                                ROXIE
                  Thanks... You don t have to stay.

                                JOANNA
                  I know.  I m just -- trying to get 
                  some information.  For the paper.  
                  Stinging red ants attack the head 
                  of the Eastwick Historical 
                  Society... it s news...
                        (silence, then)
                  Plus, you look like you could use 
                  the company.

    Roxie nods, upset.

                                ROXIE
                  I m really worried about Bun.  
                  She s kind of a kooky old lady, but 
                  -- she s also really sweet, and her 
                  shop is next to mine and we have 
                  lunch every Tuesday and she made me 
                  soup when my husband died and she 
                  used to baby-sit Mia and -- I just 
                  hope she s gonna be okay-

                                JOANNA
                  I m sure she ll be fine... I m 
                  Joanna.  By the way-                                                                                  12.



                                ROXIE
                  I know... It s a small town...

                                JOANNA
                  I just thought -- since we ve never 
                  had an actual conversation-

                                ROXIE
                  That s not true.  Once you came 
                  into my shop with your friend -- 
                  Penny, I think her name is?  And I 
                  said  can I help you  and you said 
                   no, I m just browsing.  And then 
                  Penny whispered something about my 
                  art being  pornographic and 
                  hideous  and then you left without 
                  buying anything.

                                JOANNA
                  Oh.  Well -- I just meant we d 
                  never... been formally introduced.

  Kat walks up then, in her nurse s uniform.

                                ROXIE
                  How is she?

                                KAT
                  She s in a coma, but she s stable.  
                  She had a minor stroke, brought on 
                  by shock.  We re gonna have to wait 
                  and see what happens...  You should 
                  go home. I ll make sure someone 
                  calls you if there s any news.

    They all just sit there for a beat, contemplating.  

                                ROXIE
                  This was a very weird day...

  The women all nod, look at each other.  Then-

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  Would you ladies like to get drunk?

    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

    Roxie has a warm, cozy little fairy tale cottage, with a 
    fireplace in the kitchen, and strange little art objects 
    everywhere.  The house is adorable, but COMPLETELY FALLING 
    APART -- tiles missing on the counter, paint peeling, etc.                                                                                    13.



    Roxie stands at the counter, mixing martinis, while Kat and 
    Joanna snack hungrily on a huge sumptuous feast at the table.

                                KAT
                  This hummus is the best hummus I ve 
                  ever had.  I can t even -- there 
                  are no words-

    Roxie walks over with the martinis, hands them out.

                                ROXIE
                  After I dropped out of dance 
                  school, but before I dropped out of 
                  art school -- I dropped out of 
                  culinary school. 

    They each take sips of their martinis.  Joanna is in heaven.

                                JOANNA
                  Wow...

                                ROXIE
                  I also dropped out of bartending 
                  school.

                                KAT
                  You know, this is fun.  How come 
                  we ve never done this before?  
                  We ve lived in the same town for, 
                  like... ever...

                                ROXIE
                  I never really liked either of you.

    A tense beat.  Then -- Joanna and Kat laugh.

                                JOANNA
                  Me either!

                                KAT
                  Me either!

                                ROXIE
                      (to Joanna, good-natured)
                  But you know what?  You re not 
                  nearly as uptight as I thought you 
                  were.

                                JOANNA
                  No, I m not...  I m not uptight at 
                  all... And you re not nearly as 
                  much of a flake...                                                                                  14.



                                ROXIE
                  -I kinda am.

                                KAT
                  What d you guys think of me...?

    A beat.  Joanna and Roxie look at each other.

                      JANEALEX
    Doormat.Married to an ass.

  Kat is mildly offended.

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  You know, Raymond s not that bad.  
                  Sure, we have our problems, but we 
                  have history too.  He got me 
                  pregnant when I was eighteen, and he 
                  stuck around, where a lot of guys 
                  wouldn t... and he s a really good 
                  kisser... and before he got laid-off 
                  from the candle factory he was 
                  climbing the ladder -- he was in 
                  charge of wicks... And sometimes, 
                  he ll just make a big batch of 
                  chili, for no reason...

    Joanna and Roxie exchange looks -- that was sad.  Then-

                                ROXIE
                  So can I ask you guys something?  
                  I m just curious: what did you wish 
                  for?  At the fountain today?

                                JOANNA
                  I don t wanna say.  It s private.  

                                ROXIE
                  But you re not uptight at all...

                                KAT
                  I ll tell.  I don t care.  I 
                  wished... for something to change. 

    EXT. NEW YORK STREET -- NIGHT

  The MYSTERIOUS MAN leaves a posh New York apartment building, 
    trailed by servants with expensive luggage.  We still don t 
  see his face, but he wears the gold ring with a  D  on it.

                                KAT (O.S.)
                  -Something big...                                                                                   15.



    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- SAME

  Kat licks hummus from her fingers.

                  -I don t even know what, exactly.  
                  It s just -- I spend all my time 
                  taking care of everybody else.  Five 
                  kids, a full time job, and -- okay 
                  I ll admit -- a husband who has the 
                  maturity level of a ferret.  
                  Sometimes I wish... that someone 
                  would take care of me for a change...  

    Roxie pours them each more martini from a glass pitcher.

                                ROXIE
                  I know what you mean.  Don t get me 
                  wrong, Chad is really great and 
                  everything -- he s gorgeous and 
                  young and sweet... But sometimes, I 
                  wish I could meet someone who 
                  really got me, you know?  Someone- 

    INT. LIMO -- NIGHT

  The MYSTERIOUS MAN lights a cigar, smoke covers his face.

                                ROXIE (O.S.)
                  -Dark and dangerous and exciting.   
                  Who moves here in a cloud of 
                  scandal, and everywhere he goes, he 
                  stirs up sex, and trouble... And he 
                  has this really huge...

    Close up on his mouth, GRINNING DEVILISHLY-

    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- SAME

    Roxie twirls her olive around her martini glass.

                                ROXIE
                  ...appreciation for art.  A 
                  mysterious, fabulously wealthy 
                  eccentric who buys all my statues 
                  for fifty thousand dollars.  And 
                  then we have amazing animal sex on 
                  Egyptian cotton sheets...  Is that 
                  too much to ask? 

                                KAT
                  No.  Sounds pretty reasonable...                                                                                  16.



    Joanna looks at them, wanting to confess, be part of the 
    group.  She hesitates, and then blurts-

                                JOANNA
                  -I m afraid to speak up for myself 
                  at work.  I m hopelessly in love 
                  with the photographer at the paper -
                  - Will?  And every time I get near 
                  him I say something horribly 
                  embarrassing and inappropriate.  
                  Last week he asked me how I was?  
                  And I told him I had a yeast 
                  infection... 

    INT./EXT. LIMO -- NIGHT

  The MYSTERIOUS MAN reads an EASTWICK GAZETTE, reads an 
    article with Joanna s byline.  We see his ring...

                                JOANNA (O.S.)
                  Sometimes I feel like I ll never 
                  get anything I want, you know?  
                  Like I m doomed to forever stand 
                  next to what I want, but never 
                  actually have it...

  The limo enters Eastwick... the license plate reads  DVH. 

                                JOANNA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                  So that s what I wished.  I wished 
                  that I could have it...

    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- SAME

  The women all look at each other.  Roxie raises her glass.

                                ROXIE
                  Here s to all our wishes.  Coming 
                  true.

    They CLINK GLASSES, A WINDOW BLOWS OPEN, A GUST OF WIND kicks 
  up through the room, almost like a mini tornado, their hair 
  is blown around, and suddenly -- the GLASSES SHATTER, they 
  all jump, startled.  The LIGHTS GO OUT.

                                ROXIE (IN DARKNESS) (CONT D)
                  That was just a little bit weird...

    INT. ROXIE S SHOP -- MORNING

    Roxie s cute little shop in the center of town where she 
    sells her art and various nick knacks.  She climbs up on a 
    ladder to place a piece on a high shelf.                                                                                    17.


    Behind her a VERY TALL MAN IN AN EXOTIC SILK SERVANT S 
    UNIFORM, FIDEL, enters.  He walks slowly, softly, very close 
    behind her.  Roxie doesn t notice.  He just stands there, 
    MERE INCHES BEHIND HER.  She turns around, finally, and, 
    startled, FALLS INTO HIS ARMS, letting out a little YELP.  
    Fidel stares at her ominously.  

                                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

    INT. ROXIE S BEDROOM -- DAWN

    Roxie wakes with a start.  IT WAS A DREAM.  She sighs.  The 
    CEILING STARTS LEAKING ON HER FOREHEAD.  She covers her face 
    with a EASTWICK GAZETTE NEWSPAPER and tries to go back to 
    sleep... We push in on the headline...  ANT ATTACK AT PICNIC 

    INT. NEWSPAPER -- DAY

  The same headline is on the paper sitting on Joanna s desk, 
    where she drinks coffee, hung over.  Will approaches.

                                WILL
                  Hey.  I just overheard Clyde saying 
                  he was looking to fill Josh s job in 
                  the next couple of weeks.  That d be 
                  a huge promotion -- you should think 
                  about applying!   

    Joanna can t look him in the eye.

                                JOANNA
                  Actually, I did have an idea for a 
                  political feature, about corruption 
                  on the town council?  I thought 
                  about pitching it, but-

                                WILL
                  -You should!  You re such a good 
                  writer...

  She finally looks up at him, dazzled, heartened.

                                JOANNA
                  Really?  You think?

  As she grins goofily up at him, he notices-

                                WILL
                  Um... You have something... on your 
                  cheek...

    Joanna, embarrassed, reaches up and FEELS HER CHEEK.  She 
    goes back to not looking him in the eye.                                                                                  18.



                                JOANNA
                  Oh... oh, that s just... puke.

    Joanna is horrified with herself, but can t stop.  It s like 
      a destructive/compulsive urge, like picking a scab.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  -I puked.  This morning...  In the 
                  car.  On the way to work... I 
                  got... really drunk.  Last night...

    Will s not sure how to respond to that.

                                WILL
                  Oh...

    Joanna wants to disappear.  Another NEWSPAPER WORKER walks 
  by.

                                WORKER
                  Will, can you come take a look at 
                  some layouts?

                                WILL
                  Sure... See ya later, Joanna...

  Off he goes.  Joanna groans at herself.  Penny walks by.

                                JOANNA
                  Penny!

    Penny just keeps walking.  Joanna gets up to follow.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  I did it again!  He will never love 
                  me...  I don t deserve him anyway:  
                  he s a volunteer fireman, he has an 
                  environmental blog, on the weekends 
                  he goes to the old folks home and 
                  plays bingo with them... he s, like, 
                  a saint -- and I m just that freak 
                  at work who talks about puke and sex 
                  toys and discharge-  

    Penny spins around, angry.

                                PENNY
                  -Where were you last night?

    Joanna is confused for a moment.  Then, she remembers-                                                                                  19.



                                JOANNA
                  I was supposed to come over and 
                  watch a movie!  I m so sorry!   

                                PENNY
                  I called you like seven times-

                                JOANNA
                  I was at Roxie s. Roxie Torcoletti?  
                  With Kat.  Rougement?  

                                PENNY
                  But... we don t even like them...

                                JOANNA
                  It was kind of a... spontaneous 
                  thing.  You d love them, actually!  
                  They re really cool people!  I m 
                  gonna have dinner with them 
                  tomorrow.  Pasta!  You should come-

                                PENNY
                  But -- I thought we weren t eating 
                  carbs this month?!

    CLYDE, Joanna s boss, walks up, squeezes in next to them, 
    surreptitiously brushing Joanna S BREAST.  She shrinks away.

                                CLYDE
                  Tight squeeze in here...  

                                JOANNA
                  Clyde.  So... listen.  If it s okay, 
                  I maybe wanted to pitch a story-

                                CLYDE
                  You ve got your hands full with the 
                  horoscopes, and that  Ten Things 
                  You Can Do to Avoid Lyme Disease  
                  piece -- you ve only given me six 
                  things... Anyway, did ya hear the 
                  big news?  Some rich guy from New 
                  York just bought the Lenox Mansion.  

                                JOANNA
                  What do you mean?  That s 
                  impossible.  The people of Eastwick 
                  own that land.  We voted last year.  
                  In a referendum.  To preserve it.  
                  As a snowy egret habitat and future 
                  site of the Eastwick bird museum-

    Clyde shrugs, starts waking down the hall, Joanna follows...                                                                                  20.



    INT. BREAK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

    ...into the break room... Clyde grabs a donut.

                                CLYDE
                  I find it a little scary that you 
                  know that.  Anyway, the town 
                  council approved the sale.

                                JOANNA
                  That s actually perfect.  That s what 
                  I wanted to write about!  Corruption 
                  in local government!  Clyde, this is 
                  a huge story-

                                CLYDE
                  Well, it s never getting written...  
                  Not only did this guy just buy the 
                  Lenox Mansion, he also bought the 
                  newspaper.  He s our new boss.

    Joanna reacts, surprised.  Clyde reaches for a COFFEE MUG, 
    BRUSHING HER BOOBS AGAIN.  Joanna makes a face, puts her arms 
    across her chest, disgusted-

    INT. ROXIE S SHOP -- MORNING

    -Fingers rub clay boobies: Roxie SCULPTS A LITTLE NAKED 
    GODDESS DOLL while talking on the phone.

                                ROXIE
                  Yes I did receive your letter... 
                  No, it was very clear, it just read 
                  like a form letter so I thought I d 
                  call and make sure you d actually 
                  looked at my portfolio -- I think 
                  my pieces would be perfect for your 
                  gallery... No, I understand... I 
                  wouldn t exactly say I m harassing 
                  you... Well if you change your 
                  mind, I have a website -- hello?  

  She sighs, hangs up.  In walks a A DARK DISTURBED ARTIST GUY, 
    ELI, 20s.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  You re late, Eli.

                                ELI
                  Time does not exist in the face of 
                  inspiration.  Do you think Van 
                  Gogh s boss rode his ass every time 
                  he was late?                                                                                  21.



                                ROXIE
                  Van Gogh didn t work retail.

  Eli pulls a rolled up canvas from his backpack, unfurls it.  
    It s a NIGHTMARISH-PIECE involving S&M HUMANOID BUNNIES.  

                                ELI
                  What do you think?  I thought we 
                  could put it in the window.  Drum 
                  up some walk-ins.

                                ROXIE
                  That... is a thought...

  Eli takes his place behind the counter.

                                ELI
                  So did ya hear about the guy?

                                ROXIE
                  What guy?

                                ELI
                  The guy.  From New York.  Bought 
                  the Lenox Mansion, and the 
                  newspaper.  I saw him!  At the 
                  Eastwick Cafe this morning, having 
                  breakfast with the CEO of Eastwick 
                  candle.  He s buying up half the 
                  town!

                                ROXIE
                  Who is he?

                                ELI
                  Some bourgeois jerk in a Rolex.  I 
                  didn t see his face, but the back of 
                  his head -- gave me the creeps.

                                ROXIE
                  Why?  Was it deformed or something?

                                ELI
                        (with disdain)
                  No.  His hair was just all... thick 
                  and shiny.  And lustrous.  

                                ROXIE
                  So who is he? 

                                ELI
                  I don t know-                                                                                  22.



                                ROXIE
                  What s his name?

                                ELI
                  I don t know!  I forget.  Stop 
                  hounding me!  I was up all night 
                  chainsmoking and burning my old 
                  canvases.  I need coffee.   

  He walks toward the back room, stops himself, remembering.

                                ELI (CONT D)
                  I do remember that it sounded like 
                  the name of a bad metal band from 
                  1986.  

  He disappears into the back room.  Roxie moves about the 
    shop, contemplating this.  She gets up on a ladder to place a 
    piece on a high shelf.  JUST LIKE IN HER DREAM.

  And just like in her dream, behind her a VERY TALL MAN in an 
    EXOTIC SILK SERVANT S UNIFORM, FIDEL, enters.  He walks 
    slowly, softly, very close behind her.  Roxie doesn t notice.  
  He just stands there, MERE INCHES BEHIND HER.  She turns 
    around, finally, and, startled, FALLS INTO HIS ARMS, letting 
  out a little YELP.  Fidel stares at her ominously.

                                ROXIE
                  I just... had the weirdest deja vu.  
                  I think I had a dream about this-

    Fidel doesn t speak.  He simply puts her down, and then hands 
  her an ENVELOPE.  Roxie looks down at it.  It s sealed with a 
  red wax D.  Fidel just stands there.  Roxie, slightly 
    freaked, opens the envelope and reads, confused and 
    intrigued.

    INT. LENOX MANSION -- DAY

    A curious Roxie is led by Fidel through the foyer of the 
    IMPRESSIVE MANSION, which is empty and decaying and filled 
    with WORKERS.  He leads her into a room...

    INT. INDOOR POOL -- DAY

    ...with an INDOOR POOL.  A HEAD emerges from the water, 
    grinning.  This is DARRYL VAN HORNE.  Late 30 s, 
    mysteriously, darkly handsome.  He stays in the water.

                                DARRYL
                  That ll be all, Fidel.

    Fidel bows slightly and leaves.  Darryl turns to Roxie.                                                                                  23.



                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  Roxanne Torcoletti.  I m Darryl Van 
                  Horne.  Very glad to meet you.  I 
                  take it you got my note?

  She nods, taking the note from her pocket.

                                ROXIE
                  You have some kind of... business 
                  proposal for me, Mr. Van Horne?

                                DARRYL
                  Yes.  I d like to hire you to 
                  sculpt me.  I m having a statue 
                  made for the foyer.

                                ROXIE
                  You re having a statue made.  Of... 
                  yourself.

  He nods, as if that s normal.

                                DARRYL
                  I went to your website.  I like 
                  your work.  Although it s not quite 
                  art, is it?  It s more like... folk 
                  art.  Or crafts.  It s cute.  
                  But... stunted.  You have real 
                  potential, though.  I d like to 
                  help you reach the next level.  Do 
                  something more... significant.  Why 
                  don t you get in the water, and 
                  we ll discuss it?

    He s now gripping the side of the pool, smiling up at her.  
  She bends down to get closer to him.

                                ROXIE
                  Wow.  That s a generous offer.  Still, 
                  much as I enjoy being hit on and 
                  insulted all at the same time, I think 
                  I ll pass.  

                                DARRYL
                  I think you ll change your mind.

                                ROXIE
                  And what makes you so sure of that?

                                DARRYL
                  Because of how much I m going to 
                  pay you.                                                                                    24.



                                ROXIE
                  And how much is that?

                                DARRYL
                  It s up to you.  Name your price.

                                ROXIE
                  I don t have a price.

                                DARRYL
                  Everyone has a price, Roxie.  

                                ROXIE
                  -Fifty thousand dollars.

                                DARRYL
                  Ouch.  For one little statue?

                                ROXIE
                  You want me to build a monument to 
                  your ego?  That s the going rate.

  He looks her up and down.  Likes what he sees.

                                DARRYL
                  You know, I m not usually attracted 
                  to women like you, but I gotta say, 
                  you re very sexy when you re 
                  robbing me blind.

                                ROXIE
                  -Women like me?  What the hell is 
                  that supposed to mean?

                                DARRYL
                  ... Bohemian.  Earthy.  Older...  

                                ROXIE
                  How old are you?! 

                                DARRYL
                  That s irrelevant.  We re talking 
                  about you.

                                ROXIE
                  Oh, I see.  Well it s a good thing 
                  that I m not ever attracted to men 
                  like you.  You know, overcompensating, 
                  insecure, middle-aged jerks?  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  25.

                                ROXIE (CONT'D)
                  See, I have a theory -- I call it the 
                   Napoleonic penis complex.   I say, 
                  show me a man who has to make statues 
                  of himself or buy other people off in 
                  order to prove what a rich, powerful 
                  stud he is, and I ll show you a man 
                  with four inches or less downstairs.  
                  Now, if you ll excuse me-

  She stands up to leave.  Darryl is upbeat and surprised.

                                DARRYL
                  Wait!  Don t be silly!  Stay for 
                  lunch.  Fidel s making game hens.  
                  We can take a shower and discuss 
                  the terms of our deal... 

                                ROXIE
                  I wouldn t shower with you if you 
                  were paying me fifty thousand 
                  dollars-

                                DARRYL
                  I am paying you fifty thousand 
                  dollars. 

                                ROXIE
                  Well I m not a prostitute!  

                                DARRYL
                  Relax, Roxie.  I m paying you to 
                  sculpt me.  The sex would be free.  
                  Unless... you d like to pay me-

                                ROXIE
                  Mr. Van Horne, I have to say, you 
                  are possibly the most unappealing 
                  man I have ever met in my entire 
                  life.  You are vain, charmless, 
                  creepy, pretentious, arrogant, your 
                  teeth are bizarrely white, you re 
                  not half as handsome as you think 
                  you are, and you re pretentious.  
                  And yes I realize I already said 
                  you were pretentious but that is 
                  just how pretentious you are!  I 
                  don t need your money.  I don t 
                  need your job.  And I don t need 
                  you.  So, if you ll excuse me, I 
                  think I ll be going now.

  She turns and walks toward the door.  Darryl calls after her:                                                                                  26.



                                DARRYL
                  You re the one who wanted me to 
                  come, Roxanne.

  She turns, startled.  He hauls himself out of the pool.  His 
    body is hotttttt.  She looks down, her eyes widen: obviously, 
    he s not wearing a bathing suit.  And obviously he s... 
    impressive.  Roxie tries hard not to look down, but she keeps 
    looking down anyway, then back to his face.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  Here you are.  Getting exactly what 
                  you want, and you turn it down, 
                  because of what?  Fear?  Pride?  
                  Useless emotions.  Get out of your 
                  own way, Roxie.  You wanted someone 
                  who gets you?  Someone dark and 
                  mysterious... who moves to town in 
                  a cloud of scandal to stir up sex 
                  and trouble?  Well -- here I am.  
                  Just like you wanted me to be...

    Roxie is confused, freaked out.

                                ROXIE
                  How do you even... How would you 
                  know that?  Why would you say that? 

                                DARRYL
                  -Don t question it, Roxie.  Just go 
                  with it.  That s what you do when a 
                  prayer is answered... Just take it, 
                  and be happy-

                                ROXIE
                  Who the hell are you?

                                DARRYL
                  I m just a humble patron of the 
                  arts... 
                        (grinning devilishly)
                  But I m a demon in the sheets... 
                  They re Egyptian cotton, by the 
                  way... I ll be in the shower if 
                  you d like to join me...

  He walks PAST HER toward the door.  We see his NAKED BUTT as 
  he goes.  Roxie watches him, totally freaked.

                                    END OF ACT ONE                                                                                  27.



                                        ACT TWO

    FADE IN:

    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

    Roxie chops tomatoes, Kat and Joanna sit and drink wine.  

                                KAT
                  So he wasn t even a little bit 
                  sexy?  

                                ROXIE
                  Oh, he was sexy as hell.  But 
                  completely annoying.

    ROXIE SLICES HER FINGER with the knife.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  Ow!  Dammit!

  She puts her finger under the faucet, the blood runs down-

                                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

    INT. ROXIE S BEDROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

    Roxie wakes up, startled, half-naked, Chad sleeps beside her.

                                ROXIE
                  Chad...?  Wake up... We fell 
                  asleep... It s almost five.  I ve 
                  got people coming for dinner...

  He turns over, looks at her.

                                CHAD
                  How come we never have dinner?

                                ROXIE
                  Why would we have dinner?

  He grabs her playfully.

                                CHAD
                  You don t wanna talk to me.  I m 
                  just a piece of ass to you-

  She wriggles out of his arms, starts getting dressed.

                                ROXIE
                  It s not that.  I just don t 
                  think... we like the same food.                                                                                  28.



                                CHAD
                  I wanna be your boyfriend, Roxie.  
                  Why can t I be your boyfriend?

                                ROXIE
                  How  bout: because you re young 
                  enough to be my nephew.  From a 
                  much older sibling...

                                CHAD
                  I m old enough to screw you!... If 
                  you gave me a chance, I might 
                  surprise you...

                                ROXIE
                  Yeah?  Well, I don t like 
                  surprises... Get dressed...

  She throws him his boxer shorts, he sighs.  Pulls back the 
    blankets, just as we re about to see his  package - 

    EXT. KAT S HOUSE -- EVENING

    A CUCUMBER in the garden, Kat reaches for it.  She gathers 
    vegetables into a basket from her WAY OVERGROWN GARDEN.  
    Raymond lounges on a hammock, the kids run around, crazy.

                                KAT
                  So Mrs. Neff is coming over to help 
                  with the kids.  There s a casserole 
                  in the fridge-

                                RAYMOND
                  I don t see why you gotta hang out 
                  with them again.  You just saw them-

                                KAT
                  I like them.  You know it s always 
                  been hard for me to make friends.  
                  And I just feel... connected to them.  
                  It s weird.  I can t explain it... 

                                RAYMOND
                  You goin  lesbo on me?

                                KAT
                        (sarcastic)
                  Yes, Raymond.  I am going lesbo on 
                  you.

                                RAYMOND
                  Cool, can I watch?  Or -- videotape 
                  it?                                                                                  29.



  She walks over, gives him a quick kiss.

                                KAT
                  Please try not to drink in the 
                  hammock all night.

  Kat gathers up the kids and rains kisses on them, we see how 
    much she loves them, what a playful mom she is.

                                RAYMOND
                  You know, I hate it when you leave 
                  me alone with Mrs. Neff!  She 
                  smells like toe jam and vapo rub!

  We see that MRS. NEFF, 70s, is walking toward them up the 
    lawn.  She heard that.

                                KAT
                  Hi Mrs. Neff... Thanks a lot...

    Mrs. Neff gives her a disapproving look, Kat sighs and walks 
  to her car.

    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

    Roxie and Kat and Joanna fix dinner, drink wine.

                                ROXIE
                  You guys should ve seen him.  He 
                  was without a doubt the cockiest 
                  sonofabitch I have ever met.

                                JOANNA
                  I can t believe he bought the 
                  newspaper.  I don t know what that 
                  means for my job, let alone the 
                  promotion I ll never get anyway-

                                KAT
                  He also bought the candle factory, 
                  and the Eastwick Inn... Who is he?  
                  What does he want?  Why is he doing 
                  this?

                                ROXIE
                  I don t know, but I don t trust him.  
                  There s something... wrong with him. 

    Just then, a MOUSE scurries by Joanna s feet.  She screams!

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  It s okay!  Don t worry.  She s a 
                  pet.  That s... Eleanor Mousevelt.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  30.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  We ve had her forever.  She s not, 
                  you know... vermin.  She s a 
                  treasured member of the family.

  But then we hear the SNAP of a mousetrap, offscreen.  A beat.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  Okay, that was a lie.  We have a 
                  little... mouse problem.  And a... 
                  rat problem.  And a... squirrel 
                  problem... Money s kinda tight. 

    Joanna and Kat exchange looks.

                                JOANNA
                  Well then... And I know this is a 
                  crazy question, but -- why don t 
                  you take that job?  Fifty thousand 
                  dollars for one little sculpture-

                                ROXIE
                  I have something more precious than 
                  money.  It s called dignity.

  She slams her fist on the counter and A SMALL PIECE of the 
    CEILING CRUMBLES, showering her with fine bits of plaster. 

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  Crap.
                        (off their looks)
                  Yeah, I know.  I need the money.  I 
                  really, really need the money.  But 
                  I don t think he d be paying me 
                  just to sculpt him... Not to 
                  mention the fact that there was 
                  something... wrong with him!  He -- 
                  knew things.  About me.  Private 
                  things he shouldn t have known.  
                  Things I ve said -- in private.  
                  Things I said only to you guys...  
                  How did he know these things?  Has 
                  he been spying on me?  I don t 
                  trust him.  I don t care how much 
                  money he s offering me.  Or how 
                  good-looking he is.  Or how big 
                  his... you know... is... 

  Kat and Joanna raise their eyebrows.

                                JOANNA
                  How big...?

                                ROXIE
                  Well, it was, basically... huge.                                                                                  31.



    They all giggle.  Roxie chops vegetables.  

                                KAT
                  So he wasn t even a little bit sexy?  

                                ROXIE
                  Oh, he was sexy as hell.  But 
                  completely annoying!

  She realizes, with a start, that she s got the KNIFE 
    suspended over her hand, about to slice the tomato.  She 
    SLOWLY puts down the knife before she can cut herself.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  Whoa... I had a dream this 
                  afternoon, that we were having this 
                  exact conversation.  Only, in the 
                  dream, after I said that -- I cut my 
                  finger.  And then I said  dammit  
                  and I put it under the faucet-

                                KAT
                  Really?  Wow!  Freaky!

                                ROXIE
                  I know, right?

                                JOANNA
                  It s probably just a coincidence.  
                  You knew we were coming over, you 
                  knew we d talk about Darryl, you 
                  knew you would be slicing tomatoes -
                  - so you had a dream about it.

                                KAT
                  Hey!  Don t ruin our fun!  Roxie is 
                  psychic!

    Roxie hears shuffling coming from the front hall.

                                ROXIE
                  Mia?  Is that you?

    INT. ROXIE S FOYER -- SAME

    MIA, Roxie s daughter, is sneaking down the stairs with her 
      DANGEROUS-LOOKING BOYFRIEND, GUS.  She puts her hand over his 
    mouth, makes him be perfectly still.

                                MIA
                  Yeah Mom!  Be right there!

  She sneaks Gus over to a window.  They talk in whispers.                                                                                  32.



                                GUS
                  You don t have to sneak me out.  
                  Your Mom s cool.

                                MIA
                  She thinks she s cool.  But really?  
                  She just wants me to be exactly like 
                  her!  And so I don t wanna give her 
                  the satisfaction of knowing... I m 
                  kind of... exactly like her! 

                                GUS
                  I don t get it... 

                                MIA
                  It s a mother/daughter thing.

                                GUS
                  It s not like we re doing anything. 

                                MIA
                  Hey... We do stuff...

                                GUS
                  -Not the big stuff...I just wanna 
                  be one with you, Mia.  It s so 
                  beautiful, it s like a poem.

                                MIA
                  -Soon.  Okay?  I promise...

  She kisses him, and hurries him out the window.

    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- SAME

  Mia walks in all casual and nonchalant, Kat and Joanna are 
    still there, Roxie notices something-

                                ROXIE
                  Is that a hickey on your neck??

                                MIA
                  What?  No!  

    Roxie touches Mia s neck playfully, Mia pulls away, eyeing 
    Joanna and Kat, embarrassed.

                                ROXIE
                  You made out with someone!  Who is 
                  he?  I want the scoop!

                                MIA
                  It s not a hickey!  You re gross!                                                                                    33.



                                ROXIE
                  Honey, it s okay to have a hickey, 
                  we ve all had hickeys.  Just... be 
                  careful, okay?  Maybe we should 
                  talk about safety.  What base did 
                  you get to?  Second?  Second and a 
                  half?...  You know where he -- uses 
                  his mouth on your-  

    Roxie points to her chest.  Mia is mortified.

                                MIA
                  -Oh my God!  You re such a freak! 

  And off she goes, stomping and screeching like a teenager.  
    Just then, a MOUSE runs across the counter, jostling the 
    blade of the KNIFE into Roxie s hand, cutting her finger.

                                ROXIE
                  Dammit!

  She puts her hand under the faucet without thinking.  Then, 
  she realizes: the dream has fully come true.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  Whoa... My finger... The dream...

                                JOANNA
                  I ll admit, that was a little weird-

  The women look at each other, not sure what to make of this.  
  As Roxie s blood runs into the sink...

    INT. NEWSPAPER BREAK ROOM -- DAY

    ...A spoon stirs TOMATO SOUP.  Will takes a bite of the soup, 
    Joanna stands there, watches, she is hypnotised by his 
    gorgeousness, he s oblivious.  He finally turns to her.

                                WILL
                  Hey.  Joanna, I didn t see you there-

                                JOANNA
                  Yeah.  People usually... don t... 
                  Anyway, I really love your-

  She gestures clumsily, spilling coffee down her chest.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  Ow!

                                WILL
                  Are you okay?                                                                                  34.



                                JOANNA
                  Yeah, I just... burned my boob.  

  She grabs a paper towel, blots herself.  Will s cell phone 
    rings, he answers it, leaving the room, waving bye to Joanna.  
    Once he s gone, Joanna sighs.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  Idiot idiot idiot idiot-

                                DARRYL (O.S.)
                  Nonsense, I thought it was cute.

    Joanna turns, surprised, Darryl s standing in the doorway.  
  He walks over, reaches out to shake her hand.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  -Joanna Frankel I presume... Darryl 
                  Van Horne.  I am a big fan of your 
                  work.  That piece you wrote on the 
                  rhubarb festival-

                                JOANNA
                  You actually read that...?

    Darryl helps himself to some coffee and a donut.

                                DARRYL
                  -Some of it.  It was boring as hell.  
                  But still... somehow... I could 
                  sense... beneath the timid, vanilla 
                  surface of your sentences, there lies 
                  someone truly... passionate.  
                  Exuberant.  Visceral... Let s unleash 
                  her, whattaya say?  Why don t you 
                  write an article... about me?

                                JOANNA
                  About you...?

                                DARRYL
                  And the town council.  Let s delve 
                  into the dirt of Eastwick, muck up the 
                  goo!  That whole Lenox Mansion 
                  business?  A travesty!  There s 
                  systemic corruption.  Someone needs to 
                  ask -- where is the money coming from?

                                JOANNA
                  Well... in this case, isn t it 
                  coming from... you?                                                                                  35.



                                DARRYL
                  Good instincts!  Follow your nose 
                  on this one.  I ll cooperate fully 
                  with the article.  We need to 
                  expose the criminals on the town 
                  council once and for all!  Hold 
                  those who are accountable, 
                  accountable!  They accepted bribes!  
                  I should know -- I bribed them!  
                  Let s blow the lid off this thing!

                                JOANNA
                  But... what about you?

                                DARRYL
                  I ll be fine.  Don t you worry. I m 
                  here to do good in this town.  I m 
                  not going anywhere... Why don t we 
                  schedule an interview?  Eastwick 
                  Cafe?  Say -- sevenish?  See you then-  

    Without waiting for an answer, he leaves.  Off her look-

    EXT. KAT S HOUSE -- DAY

  The kids run around the yard, Kat exits the house in her 
    nurse s uniform, the kids surround her, hug her, she hugs 
    them back, kisses them, Raymond s in the hammock, drinking a 
    beer.

                                KAT
                  You guys be good... Mrs. Neff is on 
                  her way... Raymond, have you 
                  thought any more about looking for 
                  a new job...?  Your unemployment 
                  ran out two months ago- 

                                RAYMOND
                  That guy just bought the candle 
                  factory.  It s only a matter of 
                  time until they reinstate me.

                                KAT
                  I don t know if we can count on 
                  that... and Mrs. Neff is expensive, 
                  and Amy needs braces, and lately, you 
                  spend every waking minute in that 
                  hammock drinking beer.

                                RAYMOND
                  What, like you re some kind of 
                  saint?  Running around with your 
                  new friends every night-                                                                                  36.



                                KAT
                  Twice.  Raymond.  I ve gone out 
                  with friends twice.  In five years.  
                  And now -- I m going to work.  You 
                  know, that thing that puts food on 
                  our table?

                                RAYMOND
                  What s gotten into you, woman?!  You 
                  think this has been easy for me?  I 
                  can t just go get any random job!  I 
                  was in charge of wicks.    

  Kat can t help it, she loses her cool. 

                                KAT
                  I m not asking for much!  I never 
                  do!  I just want you to pitch in a 
                  little!  Help with the kids, clean 
                  out the garage!  What s it gonna 
                  take?!  Does the freakin  Earth 
                  have to move in order for you to 
                  get out of that goddam hammock?!?!

    Suddenly, the GROUND STARTS TO RUMBLE AND SHAKE.  A minor 
    earthquake!  The kids scream, like it s fun and exciting, Kat 
  is freaked out, Raymond falls out of the hammock with a thud!  

                                RAYMOND
                  ...How did you do that?

                                KAT
                  I didn t... do anything!  I have to 
                  go.  I m late for work-

  He gets up, she s freaked, hurries away, gets in her car.

    INT. KAT S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

  Kat takes a moment, breathing hard, eyes darting, worried.  
  She turns on the car.  The radio springs to life.

                                RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                  Whoa, did anyone else feel that?  I 
                  think Eastwick just had her first 
                  earthquake...

    INT. EASTWICK CAFE -- NIGHT

  The radio plays in here too.  This is the town diner, 
    bustling with people who stare subtly as well as openly at 
    Joanna and Darryl, who sit in a booth.                                                                                   37.



                                RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                  -I d put that as a ten-point-o on 
                  the Richter scale of weird....In 
                  honor of Mother Nature, here s some 
                  AC/DC!

     You Shook Me All Night Long  comes on.  A WAITRESS 
    approaches Darryl and Joanna, batting her eyelashes at Darryl 
    seductively, she places a mug of coffee in front of him.

                                WAITRESS
                  Is there anything else I can get 
                  you, Mr. Van Horne?

                                JOANNA
                  -I ll take that coffee I ordered-

                                WAITRESS
                        (focused only on Darryl)
                  Right.  And for you?

                                DARRYL
                  What do you have in the way of pie?

                                WAITRESS
                        (like it s foreplay)
                  We have.  Any kind.  You want.

                                DARRYL
                  Do you have... pumpkin?

                                WAITRESS
                  We have the sweetest pumpkin you ll 
                  ever taste.  I ll cut a slice myself.

  The waitress does her best  sexy walk.   Darryl is pleased. 

                                DARRYL
                  Everyone here s so friendly.

                                JOANNA
                  This town is going through hard 
                  times.  They think you re gonna 
                  save us... Can I ask you something?

                                DARRYL
                  I hope so.  Otherwise this is gonna 
                  be one helluva short interview-

                                JOANNA
                  -Why Eastwick?  Why now?  What 
                  exactly do you have planned for us?                                                                                  38.



  He leans in, smiling, about to answer.  Then-

                                DARRYL
                  Do you ever take that bun out of 
                  your hair?  Or is it permanent, 
                  like a tattoo?

                                JOANNA
                        (offended)
                  I take it out.

                                DARRYL
                  Don t get me wrong.  I like the 
                  bun.  Kind of a sexy librarian 
                  thing.  It s just that it s a 
                  little... tight.  Almost like you 
                  feel the need to... bind yourself 
                  up, because you re afraid of what 
                  might happen if you just... let it 
                  all go... But see, I don t think 
                  you need to be afraid.  That s when 
                  the fun starts...

                                JOANNA
                  Mr. Van Horne, your reputation 
                  proceeds you.  And I have to say, 
                  I m flattered.  But -- I work for 
                  you.  This is highly inappropriate-

                                DARRYL
                  I m not hitting on you, Joanna.

  She looks a little hurt.

                                JOANNA
                  You re not?

                                DARRYL
                  I mean, I certainly will.  If you 
                  want me to.  But I believe your 
                  heart belongs to another.  A 
                  certain strapping young 
                  photographer at our fair newspaper.

                                JOANNA
                  Who, Will?  Oh no.  No, we re not-

                                DARRYL
                  Oh, I know you re not... You seem 
                  detirmined to get in your own way 
                  when it comes to him... Protection, 
                  maybe?  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  39.

                                DARRYL (CONT'D)
                  Plus, it doesn t help that you 
                  dress like a second grade teacher 
                  circa 1982.  And then there s the 
                  problem of your eyes-

                                JOANNA
                  What s wrong with my eyes?

                                DARRYL
                  Nothing!  Your eyes are... 
                  phenomenal.  You have the kind of 
                  eyes that render men helpless.  
                  They re hypnotic.  Your eyes are 
                  the seat of your power, Joanna.  
                  But you don t even use them!

                                JOANNA
                  How exactly would I... use them?

                                DARRYL
                  You could try actually looking at 
                  him once in a while!  Also, you 
                  have to believe.  That people will 
                  want to do what you want them to 
                  do... that belief is the secret of 
                  persuasion... Give voice to what 
                  you want, and believe they ll want 
                  it too, and they will... 

  He leans in real close, talking all low and sexy, staring 
    into her eyes.  Joanna s uncomfortable.

                                JOANNA
                  That sounds... kinda... ridiculous.  
                  And simplistic. I don t really think-

                                DARRYL
                  -That s right, don t think!  Just 
                  do it.  Everyone in this world has 
                  a talent. You ve been hiding from 
                  yours your entire life, Joanna.  
                  You have the power to make men do 
                  what you want.  You are hypnotic!  
                  And yet you fear that power so 
                  much, that you tell yourself that 
                  no one will ever do what you want.  
                  And so no one ever does.  Don t be 
                  afraid!  Find your power.  Use it.  
                  Hone it.  Harness it.  

  The waitress places the pie in front of Darryl with a 
    seductive smile, he takes a bite, closes his eyes in ecstacy, 
    enjoying it.  Joanna watches Darryl, she touches her bun... 
    Darryl picks up his knife-                                                                                  40.



    INT. ROXIE S SHOP -- DAY

    CLOSE ON ANOTHER KNIFE.  This one held by a MYSTERIOUS, 
    SINISTER (YET HANDSOME) YOUNG MAN, 20s.  Roxie stares at him, 
    terrified.   

                                ROXIE
                  Jamie, we can talk about this-

                                JAMIE
                  No, we can t-

                                ROXIE
                  You don t have to do this!  I m on 
                  your side!  You know I am.

                                JAMIE
                  You re on his side.  I can t trust 
                  you anymore!  You ve proven that!

  He pushes her into a corner, violently, grabs her by the 
    neck.  She fights back, they struggle, Roxie is upset, 
    thrashing about, he pushes the knife up to her throat.

                                JAMIE (CONT D)
                  I m sorry.  But I have to kill you-

                                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

    INT. ROXIE S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

    Roxie WAKES UP in a cold sweat, clutching her neck and 
    gasping for breath.  IT WAS A DREAM.  It s still dark.  She 
    tries to go back to sleep...

    INT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

  Kat works the night shift.  She enters Bun s room just as a 
    DOCTOR is leaving.  It s quiet and peaceful, just the BEEP 
    BEEP of Bun s heart monitor.  Kat gently touches BUN S ARM, 
    stroking it, suddenly BUN GRABS HER WRIST.  Bun s eyes open.

                                BUN
                  This is all your fault!

  Kat is startled.

                                KAT
                  What?

                                BUN
                  You did this!  The three of you!  I 
                  can see the cone of power!  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  41.

                                BUN (CONT'D)
                  It surrounds you!  It s growing 
                  stronger!  It s only a matter of 
                  time...  I just don t understand... 
                  how he broke through... and why now-

  Kat looks at Bun like she s NUTS.

                                KAT
                  I think you re just... a little 
                  groggy.  On account of the... coma.

  Bun grows increasingly agitated.  Grabs Kat s wrist harder.

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  Ow!

                                BUN
                  Listen to me!  I was the only one 
                  left!  He killed the others!  I was 
                  keeping him out!  And then you 
                  three invited him in!  It s all 
                  your fault!

                                KAT
                  What are you talking about?

                                BUN
                  This has all happened before!   
                  This is just as he wanted it!  And 
                  now the seduction can begin...  New 
                  worlds will open up, worlds you 
                  could never imagine... But the 
                  darkness is there... always 
                  there... you won t even realize... 
                  Until you end up dead!  Don t you 
                  understand?!  He s evil, child!

                                KAT
                  Who?

  Bun struggles to speak.  She looks confused -- why won t the 
    words come out?  She keeps struggling -- it s as if something 
  or someone isn t letting her mouth move.  Finally, she gets 
  out a-

                                BUN
                  D-

  But she can t get the rest of the word out.  Suddenly Bun 
    FLATLINES.  Kat pushes the call button and administers CPR, 
  as the DOCTOR and another NURSE come rushing in.

                                    END OF ACT TWO                                                                                  42.



                                        ACT THREE

    INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

  Kat sits in a chair in Bun s hospital room.  Bun is back in 
  her coma, the machines beeping.  Kat stares at her, nervously 
    biting her nails...

                                JOANNA (PRELAP)
                  You have a gift.  You ve been 
                  hiding from it your entire life.

    INT. NEWSPAPER -- DAY

    Joanna stares nervously at CLYDE from afar.

                                JOANNA
                        (whispers to herself)
                  Look him in the eye.  Give voice to 
                  what you want... This is so stupid.

  She takes a deep breath, walks over to Clyde s desk.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  Clyde?  Can I talk to you?

  He doesn t look up, types on his computer.  Annoyed.

                                CLYDE
                  What is it?  I m kinda busy-

                                JOANNA
                  It s about that promotion... I d 
                  like to be considered...

                                CLYDE
                  Joanna, I m sorry.  I just don t 
                  think you re ready-

                                JOANNA
                  -Could you -- look at me?

  He looks up, annoyed, they lock eyes.  A beat.  Then-

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  I d like to be considered for the 
                  job.  I deserve it, Clyde.  I m a 
                  good writer.  I work hard... 

  He stares at her, transfixed by her eyes.  Then, totally 
    sincere, as if these thoughts are new, and coming from him-                                                                                  43.



                                CLYDE
                  Joanna, you know what?  You re a 
                  damn good writer.  You work harder 
                  than anyone here.  I m gonna 
                  consider you for that promotion.  
                  You deserve it.

                                JOANNA
                  Wait -- what?

  He looks away from her, back to his computer.  She stands 
    there, stunned, not sure what to make of this.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  But... okay...

    Joanna turns and walks away, slightly dazed.  She runs into a 
    MALE WORKER, holding a DONUT he s about to eat.

                                WORKER
                  Hey Joanna.  You missed the donuts!  
                  Got the last one.  Powdered sugar.  
                  My favorite...

    Joanna looks him in the eye, wanting to experiment-

                                JOANNA
                  Edgar.  You don t like powdered 
                  sugar.  You wanna give it to me. 

  As if it s his idea, he holds out the donut-

                                WORKER
                  Do you want this?  I think I... 
                  hate powered sugar.  

  He hands her the donut and walks away.  Joanna is FREAKED.  
  She walks over to PENNY S DESK.  Penny stares at her 
    computer.

                                JOANNA
                  I just got a donut...

    Penny ignores her, stands up to walk away, ignoring her.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  Penny, wait!

    Penny turns, annoyed.  They lock eyes.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  You wanna come back here and talk.                                                                                  44.



                                PENNY
                  No I don t.

    Penny walks away.  Joanna contemplates, takes a bite of 
    donut.  

                                JOANNA
                  Huh.  Why didn t that work...?
                        (powerdered sugar hits her 
                        blouse)
                  Aw.  Dammit...

  She BRUSHES SOME OFF...

    INT. KAT S LIVING-ROOM -- EVENING

    ...A HAND brushes a FILTHY SHIRT, COVERED IN FOOD CRUMBS.  
    It s RAYMOND, he looks down at the mess on his shirt and 
    shrugs, puts some crumbs in his mouth, watching TV on the 
    couch, Kat walks in, stirring some food in a bowl.

                                KAT
                  Raymond...?

  He doesn t look at her, just flips channels.  She puts down 
  the bowl, sits on the couch, reaches for him-

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  You re gonna have to talk to me at 
                  some point-

  He shrinks away.

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  Raymond.  Come on!  You don t want 
                  me to touch you?!  This is crazy-

                                RAYMOND
                  There s something wrong with you.

                                KAT
                  There s nothing wrong with me.

                                RAYMOND
                  It s your new friends.  They did 
                  something to you.  Put some kind 
                  of... spell on you.

                                KAT
                  A spell?!  Will you listen to 
                  yourself?  That s nuts!                                                                                  45.



                                RAYMOND
                  I always knew that Roxie Torcoletti 
                  was... abnormal.  After what she 
                  did to her husband-

                                KAT
                  Raymond!  She did not kill him!

                                RAYMOND
                  Yeah?  Let s see -- they had a 
                  fight in the middle of the Eastwick 
                  Inn where dozens of witnesses heard 
                  her say she wanted him to  fall on 
                  his sword  for her.  The next day, 
                  guy goes fishing -- gets impaled on 
                  a swordfish.

                                KAT
                  It s a coincidence!  Do you really 
                  think she stabbed him with a fish?

                                RAYMOND
                  I think she made it happen somehow.  
                  Like you and that goddam earthquake!  

                                KAT
                  I did not  cause an earthquake!

  He stands up quick, scared.

                                RAYMOND
                  Don t say another word!  I don t 
                  wanna end up dead!  I m taking the 
                  kids to Arby s.  I ll see you 
                  later.

  He leaves, she calls after him, practically in tears-

                                KAT
                  I am not a freak!

                                ROXIE (PRELAP)
                  What s wrong with being a freak?

    INT. EASTWICK INN -- NIGHT

    Roxie and Kat and Joanna have dinner at this crowded, 
    elegant, candlelit, fancy restaurant.  Kat is upset.  
    Joanna s GOT HER HAIR DOWN, she looks incredibly sexy.  

                                ROXIE
                  I ve always liked being a freak.  
                  And I always knew I was psychic.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  46.

                                ROXIE (CONT'D)
                  And it s been getting so much 
                  stronger lately, and I thought: 
                  this is cool!  It s fun and 
                  exciting and empowering...  But who 
                  knew I would foresee my own 
                  horrible death!

                                JOANNA
                  That s a little dramatic.  It was  
                  a dream.

                                ROXIE
                  So was the one where I fell off the 
                  ladder.  And where I cut my finger.  
                  And they both came true.  Even when 
                  I tried to stop the one with the 
                  finger.  It still came true!  That 
                  means I can t stop this-

                                JOANNA
                  You ve had thousands of dreams in 
                  your life that didn t come true.  
                  You re not gonna be strangled by 
                  some guy named Jimmy-  

                                ROXIE
                  Jamie.

                                JOANNA
                  Whatever.  Either.  You said you 
                  knew him well in the dream.  But 
                  you ve never even met him.  He 
                  probably doesn t even exist.

                                ROXIE
                  Maybe... I don t know... So are you 
                  gonna tell us or am I gonna have to 
                  ask?

                                JOANNA
                  What?

                                ROXIE
                        (re: her new look)
                  What s with the... everything.

                                JOANNA
                  Like you said -- I feel good.  I 
                  feel... powerful.  Or something... 

                                ROXIE
                  Well you look like a goddess.

    Joanna touches her hair.                                                                                  47.



                                JOANNA
                  I feel a little self-conscious.

                                ROXIE
                  Hey, how s Bun?  I went over there 
                  today and they said she almost died 
                  last night-

                                KAT
                  She s stabilized.  But I think the 
                  stroke affected her brain.  She 
                  said some... things.  

                                JOANNA
                  What kind of things?

                                KAT
                  Nothing.  Just some nonsense.  
                  About -- a cone of power.  And, you 
                  know... evil...

                                DARRYL (O.S.)
                  Ladies...

    They turn and see DARRYL approaching their table, smiling.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  Welcome to my restaurant.  Dinner s 
                  on me tonight.  That is, if I can 
                  join you.

    Roxie rolls her eyes.

                                JOANNA
                  Sure!  That d be great!

    Darryl takes a seat, looks at Kat intensely.

                                DARRYL
                  Kat, Kat, Kat.  Finally we meet. 

  He kisses her hand.  Then examines it.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  Very potent.  The hand of a healer, 
                  a mother.  Like nature herself.  
                  Nurturing, destructive...

  Kat takes her hand back, uncomfortable.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  It s so wonderful to see you three 
                  together.  It s... majestic... 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  48.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  I have something special for the 
                  occasion.  Did you know that the 
                  Lenox property has one of the last 
                  remaining wells in all of Eastwick?  
                  The water comes from miles beneath 
                  the surface of the Earth.  An old 
                  legend says it contains magical 
                  properties.  And that if you drink 
                  enough of it, it ll make you drunk.

  He motions to FIDEL, who walks over with a pitcher, and pours 
    them each a glass.

                                JOANNA
                  Sounds like fun!

                                KAT
                  It s water.  Water s water.

                                DARRYL
                  You don t believe in magic?

                                KAT
                  No.  I don t.  And I m so sick of 
                  this town with its dumb old legends 
                  and myths.  Witches and water and 
                  whatnot.  It makes us all seem 
                  like... dumb gullible hicks.

                                DARRYL
                  Oh.  Well -- still tastes pretty 
                  good.  So drink up.

    They each take a sip of the water, Kat reluctantly.  Darryl 
    leans over and whispers in Roxie s ear.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  I ve got a rather large lump of 
                  clay sitting in my house, waiting 
                  for you to get your hands on it...

                                ROXIE
                  My hands are going nowhere near 
                  your lump of clay.

                                DARRYL
                  Roxie.  I ll pay you sixty... You 
                  need the money.  I need the statue.  
                  Just take the job.  I promise no 
                  funny business...  

  She looks at him, assessing.  Then, she sighs.                                                                                  49.



                                ROXIE
                  Fine.

                                DARRYL
                  I ll be posing nude by the way.

                                ROXIE
                  You are such a pig.

    They each drink up from their water...

    EXT. TOWN SQUARE -- LATER

  ON THE HUGE FOUNTAIN IN THE TOWN SQUARE.  Roxie, Joanna, Kat, 
  and Darryl burst out of the Eastwick Inn, across the street, 
  run toward the fountain.  PASSERSBY stop to stare.  They re 
    laughing, clearly inebriated, passing a bottle of WATER 
    around like it s whiskey.

  The women LEAP into the fountain and splash around, laughing.  
    Darryl watches, admiring, happy.  

    PENNY walks by, cutting through the town square, carrying 
    shopping bags.  She watches the spectacle for a moment, 
    upset.  Then keeps walking.  Joanna doesn t see her.  Takes a 
  sip of Darryl s water.

                                JOANNA
                  This water is amazing!  I feel so 
                  light!

                                ROXIE
                  Me too!

                                KAT
                  Me too!

  The women all look down in that moment, their feet are 
    beginning to RISE in the water, just a tiny bit, barely 
    perceptible -- less than an inch.  This isn t visible outside 
  the fountain, but they see it, feel it.  They all look at 
    each other, and burst into hysterics.  This makes them FALL 
    into the fountain, soaking them.  They splash each other.

                                RAYMOND (O.S.)
                  Kat??  What the hell are you 
                  doing?!

    They look up and see RAYMOND standing there, with the kids, 
  and MRS. NEFF, the babysitter, holding ice cream cones.  He 
  is pissed.

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                  50.



                                        ACT FOUR

    EXT. TOWN SQUARE -- NIGHT

    Kat, soaking wet but out of the fountain, argues with 
    Raymond, while Roxie, Joanna, Darryl, the kids, and Mrs. Neff 
    watch from afar, PEOPLE pass by pretending not to stare.

                                RAYMOND
                  We re going home.  Now!

  He grabs her arm, she pulls away.

                                KAT
                  Ow!  Let go of me.

                                RAYMOND
                  You re drunk!

                                KAT
                  I had water!  And you re drunk 
                  every day!

                                RAYMOND
                  I don t want you to see those 
                  people again.  I don t like what 
                  they do to you.

                                KAT
                  You can t tell me what to do!

                                RAYMOND
                  Kat, be a mother to your kids and 
                  let s get in the car.

  Kat looks at her kids.  She looks around and sees PEOPLE 
    STARING at her.  She s embarrassed, grabs the littlest KID 
    into her arms, and walks away with her family.

    INT./EXT. DARRYL S BENTLEY -- NIGHT

    Darryl and Roxie and Joanna sit in the back, Fidel drives.  

                                ROXIE
                  She needs to divorce that 
                  sonofabitch.

                                JOANNA
                        (drunk)
                  You know who s not a sonofabitch?  
                  Will.  You know who s totally 
                  awesome?  Will.  You know who I 
                  would give anything to be with?                                                                                  51.



                                ROXIE
                  -Hold on... Don t tell me-

                                JOANNA
                  -Will.

                                ROXIE
                  Really.  I wasn't expecting that.

                                JOANNA
                  -Anything.  I d give anything.  I 
                  just want to make him love me...

  The car stops outside Joanna s little cottage.  Darryl and 
    Joanna get out, he helps her to the door.  She hangs on him 
    drunkenly, but he is a perfect gentleman.

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  I m gonna try tomorrow.  I m gonna 
                  see if it works.  I m gonna use my 
                  eyes...

                                DARRYL
                   Atta girl.

                                JOANNA
                  Do you like my hair?

                                DARRYL
                  Yes.  I like your hair very much...

  We see THE FULL MOON rising behind them...

    EXT. BEACH -- NIGHT

    Roxie s daughter, MIA, walks under the FULL BLOOD RED MOON,  
  now high in the sky, with GUS.  Storm clouds move over the 
    sky, quickly.

                                MIA
                  It s about to rain... 

                                GUS
                  That just makes it more romantic.

  He puts his arm around her, she s nervous, not into it.

                                MIA
                  I m cold, I think I wanna go home-

                                GUS
                  I ll keep you warm.  You promised 
                  me tonight!  You re just scared...                                                                                  52.



  He kisses her neck.  The RAIN starts to pelt them.  He gets 
    more aggressive.  Pulls her to the ground.

                                MIA
                  Gus!  Stop it!  Please!  NO!

    He s on top of her, they struggle.  He gets violent-

                                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

    INT. DARRYL S BENTLEY -- NIGHT

    Roxie wakes up with a start.  IT WAS A DREAM.  Darryl s 
    beside her.  She s disoriented.

                                ROXIE
                  What just happened?

                                DARRYL
                  You fell asleep.  You have the most 
                  adorable little snore... 

  She reels.  He points through the open sun roof.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  Look at the moon, it s red...

                                ROXIE
                  It is... Oh my God...

    Roxie goes through her purse, pulls out her cell, dials, 
    waits-

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  ...She s not answering!  She was on 
                  a beach.  We have to find her.  

                                DARRYL
                  Because of a dream?

                                ROXIE
                  Yes, because of a dream!  Look at 
                  those clouds -- it s gonna rain!  
                  It s happening!  It s coming true! 

    Darryl sees that she s serious.  He leans forward.

                                DARRYL
                  Fidel, the beach.  Pronto.  

  The car takes off squealing.  It begins to rain...                                                                                  53.



    INT. KAT S HOUSE -- NIGHT

  Kat and Raymond argue.  The RAIN is coming down outside.

                                RAYMOND
                  You are an embarrassment, Kat!  To 
                  me, to your children.  I don t know 
                  what s wrong with you-

                                KAT
                  You know what s wrong with me?  
                  I ve taken your crap for ten years, 
                  Raymond, because you were the 
                  father of my children and I thought 
                  I had to.  But this ends now!  I m 
                  not gonna do it anymore!  You need 
                  to treat me with respect!

                                RAYMOND
                  What I need is a drink.  I m going 
                  to Buckets.   Cause I am this close 
                  to smackin  you.  

  He goes for the door, out into the rain, she stands in the 
    doorway, calls after him.

                                KAT
                  You know, maybe I m not the one 
                  with the problem!  Maybe the 
                  problem is you, Raymond!  Maybe 
                  there s something wrong with you!

  He stops in his tracks, stands there in the rain.

                                RAYMOND
                  Watch it, Kat, I mean it!

                                KAT
                  No!  I don t wanna watch it!  
                  Because not only are you a mean 
                  SOB, you re dull, Raymond.  You re 
                  boring!  You just sit on the couch 
                  and drink.  You ve got no fire, no 
                  spark, no electricity!

    Raymond turns to walk toward his car, and he s suddenly 
    STRUCK BY LIGHTENING.  He falls to the ground in a heap. Kat 
    gasps, her eyes widen.

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  Oh my God...

                                    END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                  54.



                                        ACT FIVE

    EXT. BEACH -- NIGHT

    Roxie and Darryl run up and down the beach in the rain.

                                ROXIE
                  Mia!

                                DARRYL
                  Miaaaaaa!

    Darryl notices something down the beach.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  I see them.

  He runs toward MIA and GUS, who struggle on the ground.  
    Darryl runs FAST, he lunges and easily pulls Gus off Mia, to 
  his feet.  DARRYL PUNCHES GUS.  HARD.  Gus falls to the 
    ground, Darryl looms over him.

                                DARRYL (CONT D)
                  Touch her again, I kill you.

    Meanwhile, Mia scrambles to her feet, crying, into Roxie s 
    arms.  Her clothes are ripped but they got there in time.

                                ROXIE
                  It s okay, baby.

                                MIA
                  Mom...

  Mia holds Roxie, sobbing, Roxie stares at Darryl, who meets 
  her gaze, they share a meaningful look.  She gives him a nod 
  of thanks, he nods back.

    INT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

  Kat runs beside the stretcher while the EMTs work on Raymond, 
    pushing him down the hospital hallway, she sobs...

    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

    Roxie hands Mia a glass of milk.

                                ROXIE
                  Do you wanna talk about it?

                                MIA
                  Mom.  Not now.  I just wanna sleep.                                                                                  55.



    Roxie nods.

                                ROXIE
                  Fine.  We can talk about it in the 
                  morning.

  Mia heads toward her room.  She turns.

                                MIA
                  I m sorry.

                                ROXIE
                  I know.

  Mia exits, Roxie walks toward the front door, where Darryl 
    waits, concerned.  His hair is wet from the rain.  

                                DARRYL
                  So I guess we took that shower 
                  together after all.

                                ROXIE
                  I don t even know... how to 
                  begin... to thank you.

                                DARRYL
                        (sincere, caring)
                  It s not necessary.

                                ROXIE
                  Yes, it is.  What you did for me 
                  tonight.  For Mia.  I just-

                                DARRYL
                  Well, I guess if you really wanted 
                  to thank me, I could spend the 
                  night.

                                ROXIE
                  You never stop, do you?

                                DARRYL
                  Do you want me to?

    Roxie looks at him.  She thinks about it.  Does she?

                                ROXIE
                  I m kinda seeing someone...

                                DARRYL
                  He s a child.  You need a man.                                                                                  56.



                                ROXIE
                  I can t, Darryl.

                                DARRYL
                  But you want to.

                                ROXIE
                  You should leave.

  He nods.  He turns to go -- SHE GRABS HIM.  Kisses him.  
    Quickly pushes him away, SLAPS HIM.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  Dammit.

                                DARRYL
                  Ow.

                                ROXIE
                  Sorry.

  She impulsively GRABS HIM AGAIN, KISSES HIM, and once again -- 
    pushes him away, slaps him.  He touches his reddened face.

                                DARRYL
                  Are you gonna do that every time?

    Roxie is out of breath.

                                ROXIE
                  No.  I m going to bed.

  He gives her a hopeful, raised-eyebrow look.

                                ROXIE (CONT D)
                  -Alone.

    Darryl nods, disappointed, he turns and leaves, as Roxie 
    climbs the stairs, visibly hot and bothered.

    INT. NEWSPAPER BREAK ROOM -- DAY

    Joanna walks in, looking sexy and confident -- dressed more 
    provocatively, hair down.  Will is standing there, eating a 
    donut.  Joanna pours herself some coffee.

                                JOANNA
                  Hey.

  He looks at her, surprised.

                                WILL
                  Wow.  You look...                                                                                   57.



    Joanna stares into his eyes.  He stares back, transfixed.

                                WILL (CONT D)
                  Different...

                                JOANNA
                  I know.  Less uptight, and plain...  

                                WILL
                  Yeah, less plain... Wait, no.  You 
                  were never plain... You were just...

                                JOANNA
                  ...Mousy.

                                WILL
                  Yeah, kinda mousy...
                        (blinks, realizing)
                  Wait, no.  Shy...  You were shy.

                                JOANNA
                  I m working on not being shy...  
                  From now on, I m just gonna ask for 
                  what I want.

    They stare at each other.

                                WILL
                  What is it you want?

    Joanna smiles, wickedly.  Then-

                                PENNY (O.S.)
                  -Guys?

    Will turns, breaking their eye contact, Joanna roars-

                                JOANNA
                  WHAT?!?

    Penny s taken aback.

                                PENNY
                  Clyde was looking for Will.

    Will nods, still confused by what just happened.  He heads 
  for the door, looks back at Joanna once, bemused.  Then he 
    goes.  Joanna is frustrated, Penny pours herself coffee.

                                PENNY (CONT D)
                  What happened to your hair?                                                                                  58.



                                JOANNA
                  Nothing.

                                PENNY
                  What s going on with you...?

                                JOANNA
                  Nothing.  Penny.  Nothing.

    Penny looks down into her mug, upset.

                                PENNY
                  I miss you.  I miss my friend.

    Joanna looks at her, feeling bad.

                                JOANNA
                  I m still here.

                                PENNY
                  No you re not.  You re different.  
                  You re acting different.  I don t 
                  know who you re trying to be, but 
                  you re not being yourself.

                                JOANNA
                  This is me.

                                PENNY
                  No, I know you.  Whoever this is -- 
                  it isn t you.  And you know what 
                  else?  If you get him, like this -- 
                  it doesn t matter.  Because it s 
                  not even real anyway.

    Penny turns and walks out, Joanna watches her, hurt.

    INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

    Raymond wakes up in bed, Kat is by his side.  Another NURSE 
  is in the room.  Kat turns to the nurse.

                                KAT
                  Can you give us a minute?

  The nurse nods, leaves.  A tear runs down Kat s cheek.  She s 
    resigned, sad, yet detirmined.  She looks at her husband... 

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  Oh Raymond... I thought you might ve 
                  been dead... I was so scared... And 
                  I started to think about the night 
                  Amy was born.  
                                (MORE)                                                                                  59.

                                KAT (CONT D)
                  When they said she was breech, and 
                  you held my hand, told me it was 
                  gonna be okay... Or the senior prom.  
                  When we danced all night, to Alanis 
                  Morrisette, remember...?  Or all 
                  those Saturday mornings when the 
                  kids pile into our bed and we watch 
                  cartoons... I m so glad you re okay.

                                RAYMOND
                  You did this to me.

                                KAT
                  No.  Listen.  I ve made a decision-

                                RAYMOND
                  You are some kind of a-

                                KAT
                  -Raymond!  Listen to me.  I m glad 
                  I remembered those things.   Cause 
                  they re important... They help me 
                  know you re not all bad.  And it s 
                  not all your fault...  I let you 
                  treat me this way, for years.  But 
                  not anymore.  I can t let you push 
                  me around anymore.

                                RAYMOND
                  I push you around?!  Says the crazy 
                  bitch who electrocuted me!

                                KAT
                  -I want a divorce.

                                RAYMOND
                  Yeah?  Done!  But I m taking the 
                  kids.  You re an unfit mother.  
                  Really shouldn t be a problem 
                  getting custody, the way you ve 
                  been acting lately.  I m sure I ll 
                  have no trouble getting a judge to 
                  side with me.

                                KAT
                  Raymond, you are not taking my kids-

                                RAYMOND
                  Watch me, Kat.  You wanna mess with 
                  me?  Fine.  This is war.

  Off Kat, devastated and scared.

                                    END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                  60.



                                        ACT SIX


    EXT. EASTWICK STREET -- DAY

    Roxie and Mia walk arm in arm down a quaint street.

                                MIA
                  So how long am I grounded for?

                                ROXIE
                  I m not going to ground you, Mia... 
                  it wasn t your fault, what he did... 
                  But I don t like the way you lied to 
                  me -- snuck around behind my back...  
                  And I blame myself for that -- I m 
                  always telling you to rebel, go wild.  
                  I thought you needed to hear it -- 
                  you can seem so grown-up sometimes... 
                  But I need to be more of a mother to 
                  you.  Hold you accountable.  Find out 
                  where you re going, make sure it s 
                  the truth... Take care of you.  I m 
                  just -- grateful that we got there in 
                  time.

                                MIA
                  But... how?  How did you...?

                                ROXIE
                  I guess we re connected...

                                MIA
                  I am so stupid.  

    Roxie tightens her grip on Mia, hugging her close.

                                ROXIE
                  Sweetie, you are the smartest 
                  person I know.  He s the jerk.  And 
                  so am I...  But things are gonna be 
                  different from now on... I m gonna 
                  be up your butt, young lady.  You 
                  have to check in with me.  Every 
                  hour.  No matter what-

                                MIA
                  Great.  I ve created a Mom-ster.

    They walk off together.                                                                                  61.



    INT. NEWSPAPER BREAK ROOM -- DAY

    Joanna stands alone in the break room, Clyde enters.  He 
    reaches for coffee, brushing her boob.

                                CLYDE
                  Sorry.  Tight squeeze in here.

    Joanna, disgusted, stares him down.

                                JOANNA
                  Clyde.  Look at me...

  He does.  He stares at her, transfixed by her eyes.  

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  You ve decided.  You are gonna give 
                  me that promotion.

  As if these thoughts are new, and coming from him-

                                CLYDE
                  Joanna, I ve decided -- you deserve 
                  the promotion.  It s yours-

                                JOANNA
                  And a raise.  Ten percent...  

                                CLYDE
                  And a ten percent raise-

                                JOANNA
                  And all the money in your wallet.

  He takes out his wallet.

                                CLYDE
                  Here.  Have some money.

  She does.  As she pockets it, still holding his gaze-

                                JOANNA
                  And also, it s not a tight squeeze 
                  in here.

                                CLYDE
                  It s really not, not at all-

                                JOANNA
                  You re just a creepy boob-brusher.  

                                CLYDE
                  -I just like boobs.                                                                                  62.



                                JOANNA
                  But you re not gonna do it anymore.

                                CLYDE
                  I m done.

                                JOANNA
                  Good, now get the hell out of here.

  He turns and leaves.  The look on his face says -- what the 
    hell just happened?  Joanna watches, the thrill all over her 
    face -- this is FUN.  A beat.  Will enters.

                                WILL
                  Hey Joanna... So listen, I was 
                  thinking.  Do you maybe... wanna 
                  have lunch?

    Joanna turns, stares into his eyes, bold, drunk on power.  

                                JOANNA
                  Will, the truth is, you ve always 
                  kinda had a thing for me.

  He stares back at her.  Nods.

                                WILL
                  You re right.  I ve always kinda 
                  had a thing for you...  I like the 
                  way you blush, and stumble around. 
                  How nervous you are, how sweet...

                                JOANNA
                  And right now, even though it sounds 
                  crazy, you just wanna kiss me. 

    They stare at each other.  He takes a step closer.

                                WILL
                  I would very much like to kiss you 
                  right now, Joanna.  

  She nods.  He leans in, and KISSES HER.  She sinks into it 
  for a beat.  Then -- she pushes him away.

                                JOANNA
                  Dammit!

                                WILL
                  What s wrong?                                                                                  63.



                                JOANNA
                  I want this... more than you could 
                  ever know... But I don t want it 
                  like this.  It isn t real.

  She rushes out of the room, leaving Will, dazed and confused.

    INT. BUN S ROOM -- HOSPITAL -- EVENING

  Bun sleeps peacefully in her coma. Pull back to reveal 
    DARRYL, beside the bed, looking down at her.  He places some 
    FLOWERS on the table.  He touches her hand tenderly.  And 
    then he turns and leaves.

    INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- SAME

    Darryl runs into a distraught Kat.

                                KAT
                  Darryl.  What are you doing here?

                                DARRYL
                  Well.  I was just... checking on 
                  you.  See if you re okay...

                                KAT
                  Actually I m not.  I m getting 
                  divorced.  And I might lose my kids. 
                  I don t know what I m gonna do...

                                DARRYL
                  I ll tell you what you re gonna do.  
                  The best lawyer in New York -- my 
                  lawyer.  Now he s your lawyer.  You 
                  don t have to worry about anything.  
                  Let ME take care of YOU.

                                KAT
                  No one s ever said that to me 
                  before...

  Kat is floored.  She looks at him through her tears.  Darryl 
    smiles.

                                ROXIE (PRELAP)
                  Well this is a new development...

    INT. ROXIE S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

    Roxie walks in, laden with groceries, to find CHAD on a 
    ladder, fixing the hole in her ceiling.  She s surprised.                                                                                  64.



                                CHAD
                  I m helping out.  I figure if I 
                  wanna be your boyfriend, I should 
                  do boyfriend things... 

  He hops off the ladder.  She looks at him, suspicious.

                                ROXIE
                  What smells so good?

                                CHAD
                  I made roast chicken, rosemary 
                  potatoes, salad, and brownies... 
                  Your favorite.
                        (off her look)
                  Mia told me... It s my favorite 
                  too... Okay, not my favorite.  But 
                  I like it...  See, we like the same 
                  foods... So, whattaya say?  Even 
                  though I m wildly inappropriate for 
                  you, will you have dinner with me? 

  She smiles, surprised.  He kisses her.

    INT. JOANNA S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT

    Joanna, alone, watches TV in bed.  Her hair is back in its 
    bun.  She looks sad and lonely.  She sighs, lets her hair 
    down.  She gets a little smile -- we see that she feels 
    better.  Her doorbell rings.  She gets up...

    INT. JOANNA S HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT

    -Opens the door.  It s PENNY.  Looking upset.

                                JOANNA
                  Penny!  Hey, what s up...?

                                PENNY
                  Somebody left this on my doorstep.
                  It s about your friend.  Darryl... 
                  He s not who he says he is.

                                JOANNA
                  What do you mean?  Who is he?

    Penny hands an envelope to Joanna, she opens it.  It s full 
  of pictures, documents, etc.  Joanna reads one for a beat, 
    then-

                                JOANNA (CONT D)
                  But, this is impossible-                                                                                  65.



                                PENNY
                  -It s all right there!  He s a 
                  liar, Joanna!  He s not Darryl Van 
                  Horne.  Darryl Van Horne is dead...

    INT. LENOX MANSION -- NIGHT

  Kat and Darryl fall into bed, kissing passionately.  

                                KAT
                  I ve never done anything like this...

  He grins devilishly, as they roll over together in passion.

    INT. ROXIE S SHOP -- DAY

    Roxie arranges pieces on a shelf.  ELI, her employee, rings 
  up a CUSTOMER.  Hands the customer a promotional POSTCARD.

                                ELI
                  I m doing an art show here next week.  
                  This is one of my paintings, it s of 
                  the night my parents conceived me.  
                  Or, as I imagine it...

  The customer looks at the postcard, is disgusted.  Turns and 
    walks out, quickly.  Eli calls after her-

                                ELI (CONT D)
                  -Art is truth, lady, deal with it!
                      (to Roxie)
                  Why do people have to live in fear?

                                ROXIE
                  Maybe it s not fear.  Maybe people 
                  just don t want to look at a 
                  painting of your parents having sex-

                                ELI
                  I think it s a tasteful rendering.

    Roxie is moving a delicate ceramic piece when THE DOOR TO THE 
    SHOP OPENS.  Roxie turns to see JAMIE, THE SINISTER YOUNG MAN 
    FROM HER DREAM.  He smiles at her benignly.

                                JAMIE
                  Hey, how you doin ?  Great shop!  I 
                  love your stuff... I m Jamie, by 
                  the way.  I m new in town...

    Roxie, freaked, drops the ceramic plate and it shatters. 

                                      END OF PILOT
