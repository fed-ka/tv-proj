The most powerful ruler in
Christendom, Philip of Spain, has
sworn to return all Europe to the
Catholic faith.
Images of rival monarchs Philip and Elizabeth in court
paintings: stiff, formal, imperious.

Hot sunlight. Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the
great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and
the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. The
Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him.
Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns
of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's
power.
Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the
crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's
eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his
people's adoration.

The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape:
its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful
fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting
bright shards of shining water in the sunlight.
P
eople passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling,
cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out.
Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than
any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something
chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the
Queen.
They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE.
Over this an insistent voice:
HOWARD (V.O.)
Why do you go among the people,
majesty? I tell you plainly, you
will be murdered! Every Catholic
in England is a potential
assassin!

The Londoners on the river bank cheer and wave as the royal

HOWARD (V.O.)
Treachery, ma'am. All Catholics
are traitors! Their loyalty is to
the Pope of Rome.
ELIZABETH (V.O.)
How many Catholics are there in
England, sir?
HOWARD (V.O.)
Immense numbers, majesty!
HATTON (V.O.)
We believe half the nation clings
to the old superstitions.

Londoners on the river banks wave and cheer. Elizabeth,
seated on the royal barge, sees them with satisfaction. She
gives an occasional slight inclination of her head in
acknowledgement.
Elizabeth sits with her favourite seated beside her, her
youngest and prettiest maid of honour, BESS THROCKMORTON.
Walsingham sits facing them, looking sourly at the cheering
spectators.
WALSINGHAM
The people are agitated.
ELIZABETH
What people?

WALSINGHAM
Your bishops are preaching that
God is showing his displeasure-
the Queen being still unmarried -
some are saying infertile -

Dangerous nonsense. Mary Stuart

Why does everyone torment me with
Mary Stuart?

Elizabeth looks back at Wsalsingham.
WALSINGHAM
Produce an heir and there'll be
no more talk of Mary Stuart.
ELIZABETH
Isn't it customary to obtain a

We shall have to look out a

BESS
Not too soon, my lady.
WALSINGHAM
There are husbands to be had.
ELIZABETH

Don't you want to be married?
BESS
I'll want the marriage if I want
the man.
WALSINGHAM
Austria. France. Sweden.
ELIZABETH
Why stop there? Turkey has a

WALSINGHAM
I confine myself to the possible.
BESS
An honest man. With friendly

Foresters at work felling great trees, working
rhythmically, in pairs. From all round echoes the same
sound, of axe on timber.

`Elizabeth! You are leading the
souls of your people to Hell!
Turn back! Marry me, and save
England!'I spoke to her just as I
speak to you now.
ow we see the royal carriage riding through mature forest,
accompanied by a mounted entourage.
IN THE CARRIAGE - The king, Philip II, the Infanta and
Father Robert Reston.
PHILIP
But she did not listen. She made
me a speech about the virtues of
virginity. Me! Virginity! She has
brought this on herself.
P

shudder.
PHILIP
Every tree that falls hurts me. I
lose a part of myself. I am
cursed with sensitivity. I feel
too much.
We don't yet know what the felling of the trees portends.
But Reston does. To him, it's a glorious sight.
RESTON
Your majesty has a merciful soul.
May 1 Blue Draft - p.11
PHILIP
I sacrifice my country's forests
to save the souls of a lost
nation. That is true mercy.
England is lost to darkness,
Father. I bring light.
WIDE NOW - We see the carriage and the royal party crest a
hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest
has been felled as far as the eye can see. Great piles of
cut timber dot the ravaged landscape. Everywhere men are at
work lopping branches from felled trees. Wagon teams haul
immense trunks away. Fires burn stacks of lopped branches,
and the smoke rises up into the empty sky.

A crowd of eager SPECTATORS and WOULD-BE COURTIERS has
gathered, held back by a line of guards, all hoping to
attract the attention of the Queen when she appears. This
is the route from the Presence Chamber to the Chapel Royal.
May 1 Blue Draft - p.15
Every Sunday the Queen processes here, and crowds gather to
see her. Two of Walsingham's men, AGENTS 1 and 2, mingle in
the crowd: faces we'll see again.
Tom Babington stands unobtrusively at the back of the
crowd. He carries a bag which may or may not contain a gun.
A
bustle of activity, a ripple of anticipation - `She's
coming!' - and the palace doors open.
BABINGTON'S POV: the crowd, the wall of BODYGUARDS, the
cluster of COURTIERS and LADIES, and in their midst,
Elizabeth, almost completely masked as she passes by.
Alongside the Queen, among her maids-of-honour, is Bess
Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham.
The people cheer, call out to the Queen, reach to touch
her, fall to their knees.
CROWD
God bless your majesty - God love
you! - See her sweet face!
Others in the crowd are shouting more militant sentiments.
CROWD
Hang the Papists! - Look out for
traitors, Elizabeth! Mary Stuart
is the whore of Rome!
Babington moves forward, easing his way to the front of the
crowd. Nearby there stands another young man who is
watching, not cheering: RAMSAY.
A WOMAN WTH A BABY pushes her way almost to the Queen,
holding her baby before her.
WOMAN WITH BABY
Your blessing, majesty. My little
one, your blessing.
BABINGTON'S POV- The Queen stopping to bless the little
baby, smiling, putting out her hand to touch the baby's
head. The mother bobs a curtsey. The Queen moves on, with
her entourage.
A sudden scuffle in the crowd. Babington turns to look.
A CLOAK SWEEPS THROUGH FRAME - dropping down to the ground -
revealing as it passes the handsome smiling face of
Raleigh, directly in R
the path of the Queen.
ALEIGH
A puddle in the way, majesty.
Elizabeth signs to the guards to stay calm. She stares at
Raleigh, then she looks down at the cloak. No sign of any
puddles. Bess Throckmorton watches, suppressing a smile.

Elizabeth looks back up, meets Raleigh's eyes with a cool
appraising gaze. Then she walks on over the cloak, shaking
her head.

The guards take up their positions once more. Bess throws
Raleigh a quick smile as she follows the royal party. His
answering shrug says: I tried. He picks up the cloak, and
stands gazing after the Queen.

Young Savage stands alone among trees, shivering, white-

Salve regina, mater
misericordiae, vita dulcedo et

In a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire. They are
young Catholic fanatics - Babington, Ramsay, and FRANCIS
THROCKMORTON. A fourth man stands before them, his back to
us, watching Savage. At first we don't see who he is.
May 1 Blue Draft - p.25
RESTON (O.O.V.)
His weakness endangers us all. He
can't go on with us. And we can't
leave him behind.
Now the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we
see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a
priest.
RESTON
Who will help him?
Babington rises. Reston nods his approval. Babington goes
off through the trees. Reston and the others follow a
little behind.
SAVAGE
(
singing)
Ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii
Evae. Ad te suspiramus gementes
et flentes in hac lacrimarum
valle -
He sings on as Babington approaches him, seeming no longer
to know what's happening. Babington takes the pistol from
his hand.
BABINGTON
Make your peace with God.
Savage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means
to do. Terror overwhelms him.
SAVAGE
No, Tom! Don't kill me! I don't
want to die!
Now he's blubbering with fear. Babington is shaken by this,
and can't shoot.
Reston begins to pray aloud.
RESTON
Si ambulam in medio umbrae
mortis, non timebo mala -
The others join in with the words of the well-known psalm.
Babington too joins in, now weeping.

Horses racing, hoofs pounding over the grass, manes flying -
Two riders hurtle between the trees, down a woodland ride,
neck and neck-
Elizabeth and Raleigh are racing against each other, faces
glowing, laughing, abandoned to the breakneck speed of the
moment.
Raleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length.
At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk.
RALEIGH
Mine!
Elizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak.

You have - the stronger horse.

The Queen does not give way to

Raleigh stops his horse. Elizabeth rides on up to him and
then past him. Raleigh secretly spurs his horse. The horse
springs forward, ahead of her.
RALEIGH
Whoa! Whoa!
(at Elizabeth, reigning
in the horse)
Forgive me, majesty. My horse
doesn't know his place yet
Elizabeth looks at him, amused, intrigued.

ELIZABETH
Have you ever known your place,
Mr. Raleigh?
She urges her horse forward, forcing Raleigh to catch up.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
I'm surprised you're not married
yet.
RALEIGH
I'm a sailor, majesty.
ELIZABETH
And can sailors not be lovers?
RALEIGH
(with a smile)
Must lovers be husbands?
ELIZABETH
Ah, I see. You like love better
than marriage. That I understand.
RALEIGH
Your majesty is not eager to be
married?
ELIZABETH
When I marry, I marry for my
country.
(looking at Raleigh)
When I love, I love for myself.
(pause)
You have had many loves, I think.
RALEIGH

ELIZABETH
You've yet to meet your equal?
Raleigh hesitates. She understands him.
RALEIGH
I would want someone who knows me
as I am.
Now it is Elizabeth who hesitates. He understands her as
well.
ELIZABETH
You want a friend, not just an
equal. You want someone to share
your joy when you're happy.
Double Blue - july 8 - p.43B
ELIZABETH(cont'd)
Someone to cry with when you're
sad. Someone to talk to when
there's nothing to say. Someone
to find by your side when you
wake in the night. Someone who
remembers what you once were,
when you've grown old.
She turns to him with a smile.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Ah yes. I know all about it.
There. I'm rested now.
She turns her horse around in the direction from which they
came. Raleigh follows.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
We can be something to each
other, I hope, Mr. Raleigh.
She spurs her horse, and suddenly she's racing away, back
across the park to the distant band of mounted courtiers
and Queen's ladies, including Bess. Raleigh spurs his horse
to follow, also fast, but this time careful to keep a
distance behind.
As they near the courtiers, Raleigh splits off. Bess
watches as Elizabeth turns and looks after him as he rides

away.

THROCKMORTON
He's old. He won't live long now.
Thank you for coming, dear Bess.

I was worried. You must send me
no more letters. You know what
would happen if I was caught.
THROCKMORTON
I need your help.
BESS
Do you need more money?
THROCKMORTON
My father is a tired old man. We

You are known Papists.
THROCKMORTON
The Queen loves you. Speak to
her.

I cannot betray the Queen.
THROCKMORTON
You are not betraying her. My

Bess is suspicious and starts to leave.
BESS
Don't put me in danger like this.
THROCKMORTON
Cousin Bess, we've known each

crashes into the sea.

Raleigh and Drake hurry along the deck in the whipping wind
and spray. Drake is watching the Spanish fleet, and
shouting above the noise of the storm.
DRAKE
They've dropped anchor. These
Spanish monsters can't handle our
English seas.
RALEIGH
We have the wind in our favour.
Do we go?
DRAKE
We go.

Raleigh at the helm of the Tyger gazing intently ahead.
Before him, the might of the Spanish Armada. Behind him,
men move down the ship with barrels, pouring pitch over the
decks. Calley lights a torch and hands it to Raleigh.

the fire-ships move inexorably toward them.

ship approaches. Men wildly fire off their muskets and the
cannons boom.

from the ship.

Raleigh, singed and wet from his exploits, is with Drake in
the cabin.
RALEIGH
How many ships are burning?
DRAKE
Four.
RALEIGH
Not enough.
He turns his face towards the coast of England. He speaks
as if to her, a quiet heart-felt prayer.
RALEIGH (CONT'D)
May God be with us all tonight.

Raging waves, black sea. The howl of the storm, the rending
of breaking timbers, the screams of drowning men. Somewhere
out there, tiny in the vast seascape, the Armada is being
smashed into oblivion.
EXT HILL ABOVE THE ENGLISH CAMP- NIGHT

Elizabeth stands there drinking in the tempest, the wind
lashing her clothes and hair, but she loves it, lives it,
breathes it. This is her storm - her victory.
