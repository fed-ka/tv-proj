      An ostentatious McMansion LIT UP for a party, in a luxury 
      gated country club community filled with homes built to 
      impress.  They re are all different, but exactly alike.


      JANE S POV from CBI VAN on the move -- The community is 
      upscale, but moving down.  Amid the ostentatious luxury are 
       FOR SALE  and  OPEN HOUSE  SIGNS outside houses.  A MOVING 
      TRUCK is backed up in a driveway. 


      As Jane and Lisbon walk toward the house from the van,  
      VICTOR MARQUESA, late 30 s, stunned, weary, and drawn, in 
      slacks, is at the front door, saying goodbye to ASRA HADAMI, 
      30 s, serious, raven-haired beauty in a business suit, and 
      MANDY RILJEK, 30 s, athletic, tough but perky, sporting pink 
      tennis togs.  He hugs each of the women, lingering a bit 
      longer on the hug with Asra.  Jane clocks this awkward hug 
      with interest.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Marquesa.  Agent Lisbon, CBI.

                                  VICTOR
                    Oh yes.  Please come in.

      He notes her significant glance to the two women...

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    These are dear friends, Asra 
                    Hadami, and Mandy Riljek.  They ve 
                    been looking after me and Oscar. 

      The two women acknowledge the agents.

                                  ASRA
                    Anything we can do...

      Lisbon nods politely...

                                  MANDY
                    Vic, I ll make sure Jim comes by as 
                    soon as he gets back in town.

                                  VICTOR
                    Thanks, Mandy.

                                  ASRA
                    Take care, Victor.

      Jane watches as Asra and Mandy walk away.          THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      8.

                    You saw the dinner theater way she 
                    hugged Victor.  She s deceiving 
                    him.  I thought it was a love 
                    affair gone awry, but it s 
                    something else.  She s probably 
                    stealing from him.

      Jane and Rigsby look out onto the majestic expanse of the 
      club s grounds that include the pool and tennis courts packed 
      with PLAYERS and SPECTATORS, a mostly female crowd.  We 
      feature PATIENCE BROADBENT on court number one, 20 s,

      cluster on the court along with Rigsby and Jane, several of 
      each on either side of the net.  There s already a 
      perceptible tension between the women.  NB we don t put focus 
      on it, but all of the women, except Heather, are wearing

      As they speak, DOLORES, wearing several layers of clothing 
      even though it s warm, attempts to approach Patience.  She is 
      tired and shivering a bit, but has a hopeful expression.  
      There is a noticeable shift in Patience s demeanor when she 
      sees her.

                    I have to go.  I have another match 
                    in half an hour and that toxic 
                    dwarf Mandy Riljek is trying to 
                    outbid me on the silent auction.  
                    What does she need  two romantic 
                    nights at the Cliffside  for?  So 
                    I ll save us all time and tell who 
                    did this if you like.

                                  JANE
                    Sure, I d like that.

                    She s having an affair with Victor.

                    How d you know that?

                    I just have an eye for that stuff. 
                    Asra must have killed Scarlett so 
                    she can have Victor for herself.  
                    Don t know why.  You ask me, he s a

                    Scarlett Marquesa so much, why are 
                    you wearing earrings that she made?

      CAPTION:  CLIFFSIDE INN 


      Last day of the tournament in full swing.  Jane and Rigsby 
      enter.  Jane notices Heather collecting balls from around a 
      court.  Rigsby sees Jackie watching a game at the courts.  

                                  JANE
                    I ll see you in there.

      Rigsby nods and moves off toward Jackie.  Jane approaches 
      Heather.

                    Kind of silly, isn t it?  Everybody 
                    so serious over a game. 

                                    HEATHER
                    Exactly.  Like it matters who wins 
                    the stupid trophy.

                                  JANE

                    they have a purpose.

      On the tennis players...


      Lisbon and Van Pelt by the CBI VAN, meeting Cho as he walks 
      up.  The place is crawling with MOTOCROSS PARTICIPANTS and 
      SPECTATORS.  The rumble of motorbikes doing aerials can be 
      seen and heard intermittently.

                                  LISBON
                    This is the designated spot for 
                      Scarlett s meeting according to the 
                    book.  Fan out and let s see if we 
                    can spot the contact.

      Lisbon, Van Pelt and Cho move in different directions.  In 
      Cho s direction, WARDELL SUGGS, 20 s, wiry, stands near his 
      CONVERSION VAN doing a deal with a BIKER when Cho approaches.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Scarlett Fever"     PINK 01/07/09      31.

      CONTINUED:3434

      As Cho reaches for his badge, Wardell pushes his bag of pills 
      on the biker and pushes him out of his way which causes the 
      bag of pills to disperse into the air and land everywhere.   
      Wardell makes a run for it.  

                                  CHO
                    Got a runner!

      Lisbon and Van Pelt see Cho take off and give chase as well.  
      Wardell ducks and weaves between bikes and people, but Cho is 
      hot on his tail. Cho herds Wardell toward an old Chevy, 
      forcing him to slow down.  Cho grabs and pushes him down on 
      top of the hood.   


      Lisbon stands guard over Wardell who leans against his van, 
      handcuffed.  Cho searches the van, and Lisbon looks up info 
      on the laptop.  Wardell sees jewelry and stuff fly out.

                                    WARDELL
                    Hey, easy there, that s antique 
                    Mexican silver!

                    I m assuming this isn t candy.

      Wardell doesn t answer.

                    What were you meeting with Scarlett

                    So we could trade beauty secrets.  
                    You mind if I smoke?

      Wardell sees his cigarettes, lighter and cell sitting on a 
      car hood near Lisbon.  Lisbon crumbles the pack and throws it 
      on the ground.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.  What ve you got, Van Pelt?

                    Wardell Suggs, AKA  Digger.   He s 
                    been arrested for several counts of 
                    petty theft, fraud and assault.

                                  LISBON
                      Impressive record.

                                    WARDELL
                    It could be better.

                                  LISBON
                    Why were you meeting Scarlett?

                                    WARDELL

                                  LISBON
                    Nothing.  She s dead.

      This straightens Wardell up.

                                    WARDELL
                    I had nothing to do with that.  
                    What happened to her?

                    Hey boss, come take a look.

      Lisbon comes around and Cho hands her several BAGGIES filled 
      with different types of pills.  The false bottom of the van 
      is filled with bags just like it.  Lisbon takes a bag of 
      pills and shakes them in front of a crestfallen Wardell.

                    bags saying this was her last time
