LOS ANGELES.
NIGHT.
(2nd Unit)
1.
A PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.
MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed
RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.
CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a
HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from
within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.
TITLES BEGIN.
CAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of
light.
CUT TO:
2.
HIGH SCHOOL.
DAY.
6.
FADE UP ON SHOT OF this large highschool and its crowds of
STUDENTS.
FOREGROUND, TINA climbs out of a cherry-red 1959
Cadillac convertible with two other students, best friend NANCY
WILSON, and Nancy's boyfriend and owner of the car, GLEN LANTZ.
FOREGROUND several GRADESCHOOLERS are playing jump-rope, and the
old ditty they sing continues unbroken from TINA's bedroom.
ROPE JUMPERS
Seven eight, gonna stay up late!
Nine ten -- never sleep again!
7.
MOVING ANGLE FAVORING NANCY.
She's a pretty girl in a letter
7.
sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural
leader.
GLEN, holding her hand, wears one of the school's
football jerseys; a good-natured, bright kid.
Tina's in
mid-conversation.
TINA
(referring to kids' song)
That's what it reminded me of --
that old jump rope song.
(shudders)
Worst nightmare I ever had.
You wouldn't believe it.
Nancy nods.
NANCY
Matter of fact I had a bad dream
last night myself...
TINA turns to NANCY, but before either can say more, ROD LANE, a
lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather and New Wave studs joins
up with them and interupts.
ROD
(to Tina)
Had a hardon this morning when
I woke up, Tina.
Had your name
written all over it.
Tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference.
TINA
There's four letters in my name,
Rod.
How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?
The guy's stopped in his tracks.
ROD
Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn
mower!
He cuts off across the lawn.
TINA
Rod says the sweetest things.
NANCY
He's nuts about you.
TINA
Yeah, nuts.
TINA makes a face and rakes her fingernails across a tree as she
passes.
TINA (CONTD)
(yawns)
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry
about the creep.
Couldn't get
back to sleep at all.
(beat)
So what you dream?
NANCY
Forget it, the point is, every-
body has nightmares once in a while.
No biggy.
GLEN
Next time you have one, just
tell yourself that's just all
it is, right while you're having
it, y'know?
That's the trick.
Once you do that, you wake right
up.
At least it works for me.
TINA looks at GLEN sharply.
He kisses NANCY and darts off for
class.
TINA
Hey!
You have a nightmare too?
But GLEN's gone.
TINA (CONTD)
Maybe we're gonna have the Big
Earthquake.
They say things get
weird just before that...
BELLS ARE RINGING, and STUDENTS crowding; TINA and NANCY are
drawn into the crush.
FADE TO BLACK
8.
A VALLEY STREET.
NIGHT.
8.
ANGLE ON A MODEST HOME; no car, just a couple of BIKES in the
drive.
Every light in the house and yard is turned on.
We HEAR
the rock group MADNESS played at a 'No adults home' volume.
9.
FRONT OF HOUSE.
NIGHT.
10.
CLOSE ON FRONT DOOR as a BOLT UNLOCKS, a KEY TURNS, a CHAIN is
REMOVED.
At last the door swings open and GLEN swaggers out.
GLEN
I'm gonna punch out your ugly
lights, whoever you are.
No answer but a slight RUSTLE in the bushes.
GLEN does a 180 and
walks right back inside.
The girls prod him right back out,
giddy with giggling fear.
GLEN
It's just a stupid cat.
NANCY
Then bring us back its tail
and whiskers.
The girls push him farther.
GLEN edges towards the shadows.
Then the SCRITCHING again.
GLEN stops; TINA edges back into the
house.
TINA
Anyway, I don't have a cat...
ANGLE INTO THE SHADOWS.
Turned from the girls, GLEN sobers,
listening.
IN HIS POV we see the street.
Silent houses.
Motionless trees on empty lawns.
GLEN
Kitty-kitty?
Chow chow chow?
Not a living, or dead, soul.
GLEN turns back to the girls with a
shrug.
Instantly, a large FIGURE pounces and throws him to the
ground with a shout.
The girls SCREAM in panic and run for the house.
11.
REVERSE -- ROD leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster --
11.
ROD
And it's number thirty-six, Rod
Lane, bringing Lantz down just
three yards from the goal with a
brilliant tackle!
And the fans
go wild!
ROD dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at TINA.
The girl's relieved and frightened at the same time.
TINA
What the hell you doing here?
ROD
Came to make up, no big deal.
Your ma home?
TINA
Of course.
What's that?
ROD takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's
wall.
It makes a terrible SCRIIITCHING SOUND.
He grins and
tosses it aside.
ROD
Intense, huh?
(sizes up the three)
So what's happening, an orgy or
something?
GLEN
Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.
ROD wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take
Glen's throat out.
NANCY breaks between --
NANCY
-- Just a sleep-over date, Rod.
Just Tina and me.
Glen was just
leaving.
ROD eyes GLEN, laughs and flips the knife closed and away,
putting his arm around TINA's shoulder and laughing as if it's
all a great joke.
ROD
You see his face?
(lower)
Your ma ain't home, is she?
(to Nancy & Glen)
Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.
He pulls TINA inside without further ceremony.
NANCY
Rod...
But ROD's already got himself and TINA halfway through the living
room, heading into the darker part of the house.
ROD
We got her mother's bed.
You two got the rest.
ANGLE BACK ON GLEN AND NANCY.
NANCY
We should get her out of here...
TINA darts to the front door, her blouse half out.
TINA
Hey -- you guys're hanging around --
right?
(fake laughing/whine)
Don't leave me alone with this
lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!
She disappears.
GLEN looks at NANCY.
Too innocent.
GLEN
So we'll guard her together.
Through the night.
(moving closer)
In each others' arms like
we always said.
NANCY
Glen.
Not now.
I mean,
we're here for Tina now,
not for ourselves.
She kisses him lightly, then pushes him back.
GLEN
(frustrated)
Why's she so bothered by a
stupid nightmare, anyway?
NANCY
Because he was scary, that's
why.
GLEN
Who was scary?
NANCY turns and looks at him.
NANCY
Don't you think it's weird, her
and me dreaming about the same
guy?
(GLEN looks away;
NANCY stares closer)
You didn't have a bad dream
last night, did you?
GLEN gives her a funny look.
GLEN
Me?
I don't dream.
He takes her inside.
Over the SOUNDS of locks falling shut we
FADE TO BLACK
13.
TINA'S HOUSE.
NIGHT.
16.
Not a car or person in sight.
A stricken breeze dies in the
trees.
17.
ZOOM IN on the window of the room where TINA sleeps.
By the time
17.
we're FULL IN CLOSE on it, the air is again still as death.
A
moment later a PEBBLE bounces off the pane.
The NIGHTMARE THEME
appears in the lower registers and holds its breath.
Another PEBBLE strikes, with a sharper RAP.
18.
TINA'S BACKYARD.
NIGHT.
21.
She looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees
rattling in the Santa Ana winds.
It seems deserted, though the
welling dark won't let her be sure.
Then another pebble -- PAP!
-- hitting with a sharp RACK FOCUS.
22.
A LOW ANGLE TO WINDOW as TINA jumps back, startled.
She hadn't
22.
seen that one coming.
But she's drawn back to the glass out of
curiousity, straining to see in the dark.
It's as if the stones
are materializing out of thin air.
23.
TINA'S BACK YARD.
NIGHT.
24.
WIDE ANGLE ON THE REAR OF THE HOUSE.
A LIGHT COMES ON.
TINA
appears in the doorway.
TINA
(listening)
Somebody there?
She can see through the backward to a yawning gate and the back
alley.
No one there.
But a word is spoken, as if by wind.
VOICE
(garbled)
Tina.
TINA straightens, unable to swallow.
There's a ragged, obscene
GIGGLE.
Deep in the throat.
Phlegmy.
TINA
Who the hell is that?
TINA charges across the yard and through the gate, the MUSIC
chasing after.
25.
A SERVICE ALLEY.
NIGHT.
25.
She brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around.
Listening.
Shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown.
A sharp crank of METAL, and fifty feet down the alley the lid of
an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals
noisily down.
26.
LOW REVERSE ACROSS LID TO TINA.
Despite herself she comes over
26.
and touches it.
She comes up with long worms on her fingers.
Next moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare
staggers into view fifty feet behind her.
TINA falls back into
the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion.
The
MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his
right hand as he spreads his arms wide.
He starts scraping the
steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall.
Orange sparks spurt
out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the
alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home!
CLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and
closer.
She begins to shake uncontrollably.
TINA
Oh, shit, please God...
KILLER
(softly, approaching)
This is God...
He holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider.
TINA runs for her life.
27.
WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace
27.
between the girl and her pursuer.
The MAN is fast; the distance
between them closes with each heartbeat.
TINA overturns ashcans
-- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a
window.
Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and
disappear in fright.
28.
TINA'S STREET.
NIGHT.
28.
TINA runs out onto front lawns, SCREAMING for help.
No help
comes.
In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on
the block to be turned off.
The MAN roars out from behind a tree
-- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl!
TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be
trapped against its locked front door.
She hammers against its thick wood.
TINA
Nancy!
Open the door -- Nancy!
The MAN slows.
He has TINA now and knows it.
MAN
She's still awake.
Nancy can't
hear you.
TINA turns and looks full at the approaching MAN.
Smudged by
deep shadow, he's big and hideous.
He wears the same dirty
yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging
and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin
over his misshapen face.
And on his fingers are the steel
talons.
29.
CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index
29.
finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand.
Then
another.
We SEE the PIECES OF FINGERS fall past TINA'S face in
SLOW MOTION.
ANGLE ON THE GROUND of the FINGERS squirming on the ground, one
flopping onto TINA's naked foot.
TINA leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they
were huge bugs.
The MAN snaps up his arm and the FINGERS fly back into place on
his hand.
He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her,
sweeping with his cutting hand!
TINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines,
and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand.
But the face
only slides off to the bone.
The MAN presses in, and TINA
contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder --
cutting her deeply.
29A.
TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably
29A.
caught in bedclothes!
She falls over her bed's conformter, twists
away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her!
The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling
-- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS --
and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until
they're beneath it, fighting for life and death.
30.
POLICE STATION.
NIGHT.
36.
FADE UP ON RED LIGHTS and SIREN as an unmarked POLICE CAR speeds
to the curb.
LT DON THOMPSON, a decent-looking man in his mid-40's, exits and
punches a cigarette from his pack.
His shaken aide, a uniformed
patrolman named PARKER, greets him.
(CAMERA FOLLOWS them from
the car straight into the station and eventually to THOMPSON'S
OFFICE.)
PARKER
Lieutenant Thompson.
Sorry to
wake you, but --
LT THOMPSON
I'd've canned your ass if you
hadn't.
What you got?
PARKER stumbles to open the door for THOMPSON as the man bulls
into the station at a furious pace.
PARKER
Her name was Tina Gray.
It
was her home.
Father abandoned
ten years ago, mother's in
Vegas with a boyfriend.
We're
trying to reach her now.
LT THOMPSON grimaces as if he knows the story.
LT THOMPSON
What's the Coroner got to say?
PARKER
Something like a razor was
the weapon, but nothing
found on the scene.
THOMPSON is already to the desk officer SERGEANT GARCIA.
The big
MAN shoves him a sheaf of papers --
SERGEANT GARCIA
(wary)
Leautenant.
You know who --
LT THOMPSON
Where is she?
SERGEANT GARCIA
I put her in your office...
PARKER scurries after.
PARKER
Looks like her boyfriend did
it.
Rod Lane.
Musician type,
arrests for brawling, dope --
LT THOMPSON
Terrific.
What the hell was
she doing there?
PARKER
She lived there.
LT THOMPSON
OMIT 37.
I don't mean her --
OMIT 37.
38.
STREET.
DAY.
40.
MUSIC slips back in, subtle but tense as we TRACK with NANCY as
she walks alone down a sidewalk edged with thick flowering
Oleander.
She cocks her head, puzzled, as if sensing something.
MUSIC mounts.
NANCY looks across the street.
40A.
REVERSE IN HER POV.
A MAN is over there in dark clothes, reading
40A.
a newspaper, but really watching her.
40B.
NANCY shrugs and continues on, then stops and looks back again.
40B.
40C.
IN HER POV we SEE the MAN is gone.
40C.
40D.
Next moment -- with a MUSIC STING -- a BLOODIED HAND jumps out
40D.
from the opposite direction, clamps over NANCY'S mouth and drags
her into the bushes.
41.
BUSHES.
DAY.
41.
NANCY struggles, twisting against the powerful assailant.
A WIDER ANGLE REVEALS ROD LANE -- barefoot, clad only in jeans
and leather jacket, still caked with dark blood.
The rest of his
skin is pale as a ghost's.
ROD
I'm not gonna hurt you.
He releases her warily.
NANCY makes no move to run or scream,
even though several STUDENTS pass on the nearby sidewalk.
This
reassures ROD just a little.
ROD
Your old man thinks I did it,
don't he?
NANCY
He doesn't know you.
(eyeing the blood)
Couldn't you change?
ROD
The cops were all over my house.
(shivers)
They'll kill me for sure.
NANCY
Nobody's gonna kill you.
He runs his hands down his face, trying to believe that.
The two
study each other.
ROD
I never touched her.
NANCY
You were screaming like crazy.
NANCY says this without accusation, just cool observation.
ROD
Someone else was there.
NANCY
The door was locked from your
side.
ROD grabs her hard.
His muscular body tenses.
ROD
Don't look at me like I'm some
kind of fucking fruitcake or
something, I'm warning you.
VOICE (O.S.)
Morning, Mr. Lane.
42.
The boy jerks around.
NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at
42.
ROD's belly, eases out of the bushes.
LT THOMPSON
Now just step away from her, son.
Like your ass depended on it.
I'm warning you.
ROD backs away, looking once at NANCY with a look of terrible
sadness.
Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell.
THOMPSON snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively NANCY
jumps between --
NANCY
No!
THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious.
THOMPSON
Jesus -- are you crazy!?
He plunges past the girl.
42A.
STREET.
DAY.
42A.
ROD races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is
soon cut off by the PLANECLOTHESMAN NANCY saw watching her before
-- and then TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, who close from another
angle.
The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and ROD is
soon wrestled to the ground.
Next moment one of the cops is
holding ROD'S knife into the air for THOMPSON to see.
THOMPSON
looks at NANCY, as if to say 'I told you.' Background, ROD'S
SHOUTS can be heard as he's shoved into a SQUAD CAR.
ROD (O.S.)
I didn't do it -- !
(fading)
I didn't kill her, Nancy!
The car's door slams and ROD is gone.
NANCY turns to her father,
livid.
NANCY
You used me, daddy!
LT THOMPSON
(exasperated)
What the hell you doing going to
school today, anyway -- your
mother told me you didn't even
sleep last night!
NANCY spins angrily and walks away.
LT THOMPSON
Nancy!
Hey!
But she just keeps going.
FADE TO BLACK
43.
THE SCHOOL.
DAY.
61.
NANCY walks out of the building, shaken.
Then she pauses at one
of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against
its bark, teeth set.
NANCY starts to shake, and next second
she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child.
OMIT 61A.
OMIT 61A.
62.
But she shakes herself silent.
Wipes the tears away with a slash
62.
of sleeve.
She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then
reacts in surprise and pain.
She lifts her arm and stares at the
spot she's touched.
INSERT ON HER ARM and the BURN there; about the size and shape of
a half-dollar.
WIDER ON NANCY.
Utterly, chillingly confused.
62A.
TINA, against the tree inches from NANCY, (SC 7) -- turns to her and
says --
TINA
Couldn't get back to sleep
at all.
(beat)
What you dream?
63.
A BUSY STREET.
DAY.
63.
NANCY is walking quickly, head erect, jaw set.
Then she enters
her father's Police Station.
64.
ELM STREET / NANCY'S HOME.
NIGHT.
66.
FADE UP ON ESTABLISHING SHOT as a spooky WIND sets a DOG BARKING
down the block.
A CAR goes by, then this pleasant residential
street falls into silence.
CAMERA has MOVED IN on NANCY's
well-tended two-story home.
67.
UNDERWATER SHOT.
NIGHT.
68A.
LOOKING UP PAST HER ANKLES we SEE NANCY pulled sharply down into
really deep water, the dim light of the surface and bathroom
beyond receding with each yank.
And yet she somehow flails and
gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure
panic to break the surface with her hands!
68B.
UNDERWATER SHOT.
NIGHT.
68C.
MARGE'S VOICE reaches to the girl, who thrusts up through main
force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders.
68D.
NANCY'S HOUSE AND STREET.
NIGHT.
76.
HIGH ANGLE, AT SECOND-STORY LEVEL.
NANCY looks directly across
the street to a lighted, open window.
Its curtains, sucked out
and waving in the night breeze, give the only motion to the
deserted street.
Then someone pitches out of the dark at her.
NANCY gives a YELP
-- then clamps her hand over her mouth as she recognizes GLEN,
balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside her window.
GLEN
Sorry!
Saw your light on.
Thought I'd see how you were.
She gets herself together, barely.
NANCY
Sometimes I wish you didn't live
right across the street.
GLEN
Shut up and let me in.
You ever
stand on a rose trellis in your
bare feet?
76A.
ELM STREET.
NIGHT.
78.
FADE UP ON NANCY, still in her pajamas, walking through the
shadowy streets near her home, listening for the slightest
sound.
We MOVE with her.
But nothing, not even the dog barking
earlier, is there now.
NANCY peers into the darkness of lawns
and trees behind her.
NANCY
(stage whisper)
You still there?
Across the street and a distance away, GLEN steps from behind a
tree.
GLEN
Yeah.
So?
NANCY
Just checking -- keep out of
sight!
GLEN throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of
sight.
NANCY turns and looks down between the houses, deep into
a dark alleyway.
Then she forces herself to walk into it.
79.
ALLEY.
NIGHT.
79.
MOVING WITH HER as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into
shadows.
Each time she pauses and waits, the MUSIC grows more
threatening and expectant.
The feeling is of immense tension --
we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any
second.
But he doesn't.
In fact absolutely nothing happens, and NANCY
emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed.
The only thing
strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to
80.
POLICE STATION.
NIGHT.
80.
The Police Station.
It takes her a little by surprise, it just
seems to have appeared.
MUSIC creeps into the NIGHTMARE THEME as NANCY whispers hoarsely
back down the dark alley.
NANCY (CONTD)
Still there?
81.
ALLEY.
NIGHT.
81.
We only HEAR the DISTANT VOICE, slightly ECHOED.
GLEN'S VOICE (OS)
(yawning)
Still here!
NANCY
On your toes, right?
NANCY stares into the dark trying to see him, but she can't.
She
turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight.
82.
POLICE STATION.
NIGHT.
82.
MUSIC MOUNTS as we MOVE WITH NANCY across the lawns to the police
station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees.
It's a
low, barred basement window, and NANCY reacts as soon as she
looks through it.
83.
POLICE STATION.
NIGHT.
84.
NANCY draws back sharply, swallowing in terror.
She looks behind
her for help.
NANCY (CONTD)
Glen.
No answer.
NANCY (CONTD)
(louder)
Glen?!
The street is absolutely deserted.
There is no motion, and no
sound save one: the distant but unmistakeable sound of GLEN
SNORING.
NANCY (CONTD)
GLEN!
A beat of silence after the shout's echoes die, then the steady,
boyish SNORES again.
NANCY swears under her breath and jerks
back around, forcing herself to look again into ROD's cell.
85.
POLICE STATION.
NIGHT.
86.
ANGLE BACK ON NANCY.
She pounds on the window, then turns in
frustration and yells into the night.
NANCY
Glen!!
She turns back to the cell in desperation.
87.
OMIT
OMIT 87.
88.
POLICE STATION.
NIGHT.
89.
NANCY pulls back from the window, stunned.
NANCY
I swear...
Suddenly NANCY feels utterly exposed.
She shivers, chilled and
vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes.
She can't
move.
It's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body
had been severed.
And she hears the SOUND behind her.
A sort of
filling-vibrating Scrriiitchh.
MUSIC sneaks in -- the unmistakeable NIGHTMARE THEME, creeping
over her.
NANCY forces herself, by sheer will, to look.
90.
Ahead of her perhaps twenty-five feet, covered with a thick
90.
plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is
TINA.
Standing square in the middle of the street.
A dark ooze
of BLACK EELS roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper
CHATTERS down and the greenish-white face of TINA lolls out.
She
gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some
desperate message.
The MUSIC FALLS TO A HUSH.
91.
NANCY backs away, eyes streaming tears.
91.
NANCY
Glen, where are you!
Wake up!
Glen!
DEEP RAGGED VOICE
I'm here.
NANCY twists around in horror at the same instant the KILLER
grabs for her face with his knife-fingers!
The girl
intinctively pitches back, then scrambles up and runs like
hell!
NANCY
Glen!
Glen!!!
92.
ELM STREET.
NIGHT.
92.
MOVING WITH NANCY at full gallop, running blind.
She crashes
through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet
cement over her ankles.
The stuff sticks to her legs in long
gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose.
The KILLER looms nearby,
mocking her -- his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight.
He
just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so
winded she can only stagger.
MOVING WITH THEM.
Time after time NANCY just barely manages to
elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and
pouring on more steam.
It's too close to even bother screaming
now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have.
The
only SOUND is of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, RASPING BREATH and the
KNIFE-FINGERS WHISTLING through the air.
93.
NANCY'S HOME.
NIGHT.
93.
NANCY tears across her front lawn and into the open front door of
her home, SLAMMING it with all her might.
There's a tremendously
satisfying CONCUSSION of wood against doorframe, and the LOCKS
fall shut.
94.
POLICE STATION.
NIGHT.
97.
GLEN's CADILLAC CONVERTABLE careens into the parking lot and
SCREECHES to a stop.
GLEN and NANCY jump out and head for the
station.
GLEN
You mind telling me what's
going on?
NANCY's races into the station without answering.
GLEN (CONTD)
Oh, I see.
That makes it all
perfectly clear.
98.
FOREST LAWN CEMETERY.
DAY.
105.
BURN ON:
THE FOURTH DAY
FADE UP ON a stark afternoon.
On a hill of sere grass
overlooking the valley, the casket of ROD LANE is lowered into
its grave.
A small group of FAMILY and FRIENDS watches soberly as the
MINISTER raises his hand in benediction.
MINISTER
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
May God be with this young man's
soul.
ON THE FACES of MARGE, LT THOMPSON, TINA'S MOTHER and ROD'S
PARENTS.
Just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an
outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks.
Furtive,
quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all
share, something beyond even this second death among their
children.
Then they are all staring ahead again, as if the
others weren't even there.
MINISTER (CONTD OS)
His life and his death attest to
the Scripture's warning that he who
lives by the sword shall die by
the sword.
ANGLE ON GLEN, watching --
NANCY, standing alone, not believing it for a minute.
MINISTER (CONTD OS)
But let us recall also our Lord's
admonition that we 'Judge not,
lest we be judged.'
Let us
attempt only to love.
And may
Rod Lane rest in peace.
NANCY
(quietly)
Amen to that much.
The mourners walk away from the grave, MARGE among them.
She
pauses near a MAN and two WOMEN in black -- TINA'S MOTHER, ROD'S
PARENTS.
They almost, it seems, speak.
Then MARGE hurries on.
WE MOVE WITH HER as she's joined by LT THOMPSON.
Both are worn
and on edge.
THOMPSON absently lights another cigarette,
offering one to MARGE.
LT THOMPSON
How's Nancy doing?
MARGE
I don't think she's slept since
Tina died.
(shakes her head)
She's always been a delicate
kid.
THOMPSON lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of
nonchalance.
LT THOMPSON
She's tougher than you think.
Any idea how she knew Rod was
gonna kill himself?
MARGE
No.
All I know is, this reminds
me too much of ten years ago.
THOMPSON blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks
away.
LT THOMPSON
Yeah.
Well... Let's not start
digging up bodies just because
we're in a cemetery.
He gives her a look that could cut stone.
MARGE toses down her
cigarete and crosses to NANCY.
The girl is simply staring off
over the valley.
MARGE
(very gently)
Time to go home, baby.
She moves her away from the brink of the hill.
106.
CEMETERY PARKING AREA.
DAY.
106.
MARGE opens the door of the station wagon for NANCY.
NANCY turns
to them both, speaking in a still, small voice.
NANCY
The killer's still loose,
you know.
She has a wild, Cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up
MARGE'S spine.
LT THOMPSON
You saying somebody else killed
Tina?
Who?
NANCY smiles a weird sort of smile.
NANCY
I don't know who he is.
But he's
burned, he wears a weird hat, a
red and yellow sweater, real
dirty, and he uses some sort of
knifes he's got made into a sort
of... glove.
Like giant finger-
nails.
As NANCY has described this monster from her dream, unseen by
her, 	the faces of MARGE LT and THOMPSON have drained completely
of color.
LT THOMPSON
(low, even, to MARGE)
I think you should keep Nancy
at home a few days.
'Til she's
really over the shock.
MARGE
I got something better...
(to NANCY)
I'm gonna get you help, baby.
So no one will threaten you
any more.
She takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car,
locking the door from outside.
NANCY never taking her eyes from
her father's as the car bears her away.

SHAKESPEARE BRIDGE.
DAY.
121.
ANGLE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET.
We hear GLEN's VOICE and PAN UP
to REVEAL NANCY and GLEN high above, two tiny figures walking
across this strange white bridge in old Los Angeles.
CAMERA
BEGINS A SLOW ZOOM.
GLEN
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
NANCY
And if you can't do that, you
sleep.
GLEN
Used to.
Not anymore.
GLEN jams more Big Mack into his face.
By now our ZOOM reveals
he's attacking a huge bag of Big Macks, and furtively eyeing
NANCY.
The girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight.
She's reading a book, hardly paying attention.
GLEN (CONTD)
You ever read about the Balinese
way of dreaming?
NANCY
No.
GLEN
They got a whole system they
call 'dream skills'.
So, if
you have a nightmare, for
instance like falling, right?
NANCY
Yeah.
GLEN
Instead of screaming and getting
nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna
make up my mind that I fall
into a magic world where I can
get something special, like a
poem or song.
(grins hopefully)
They get all their art literature
from dreams.
Just wake up and
write it down.
Dreamskills.
He stops, seeing the look on NANCY's face.
Our ZOOM is much
closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids.
NANCY
And what if they meet a monster
in their dream?
Then what?
GLEN
They turn their back on it.
(grins hopefully)
Takes away its energy, and
it disappears.
NANCY
What happens if they don't do
that?
GLEN
(shrugs)
I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.
NANCY
Great.
She leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book.
GLEN tips its cover and reads its title.
OUR ZOOM IS STILL
MOVING CLOSER, a MEDIUM CLOSE UP NOW.
GLEN
'Booby Traps and Improvised
Anti-personel Devices'!
NANCY
I found it at this neat
survivalist bookstore on
Ventura.
GLEN
(shocked)
Well what you reading it for?
OUR ZOOM LOCKS IN ON A TIGHT TWO ON THEIR FACES, NANCY's grimly
determined.
NANCY
I'm into survival.
She walks away, OUT OF FRAME, leaving GLEN watching after her in
astonishment.
GLEN
She's starting to scare the
living shit out of me.
122.
122.
ANGLE ACROSS NANCY'S "TREE LAWN", the grass between
the sidewalk and the street, in the general direction
of GLEN's home.
This ANGLE doesn't quite reveal
Nancy's house.
FOREGROUND is a utility truck in which a half dozen
Hispanic WORKERS are loading tools, extension cords
and hardware.
They
look like they've put in one hell of a hard day's work.
MARGE appears and hands a check to the FOREMAN of the crew, a
white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain.
He scrutinizes
it.
FOREMAN
And the other...
MARGE forks over a wad of cash, hands trembling in her
half-drunk, helpless rage.
MARGE
Where's your mask and gun?
The FOREMAN counts the money swiftly.
FOREMAN
Don't bust my chops, lady.
If the city found out I put
'em in without inside releases
I'd loose my license.
He shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck.
MARGE
EXITS FRAME for her house.
PAN WITH THE TRUCK as it pulls away, THEN PICK UP NANCY, walking
across the street from the corner.
Alone.
Dispirited.
She
lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks.
NANCY
Oh gross...
123.
WIDENING TO REVEAL THE HOUSE as NANCY walks across her front
123.
yard.
Every single window has been covered with brand-new
ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames.
CLOSER, AT A WINDOW.
NANCY gives a set of bars a powerful
shake.
They don't budge.
Then girl looks up and sees even the
window to her second floor bedroom is barred.
And the rose
trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a
tangle of wood, thorns and broken flowers.
124.
ELM STREET.
NIGHT.
127.
WIDE ON THE STREET AND BOTH HOUSES, GLEN's on the right, NANCY's
on the left.
A TELEPHONE RINGS.

BEDROOM WINDOW.
128.
THE VALLEY AND HILLS.
NIGHT.
131.
HIGH, WIDE SHOT.
The moon is above the horizon.
A cool wind
slides a bank of white fog inland.
The valley and its lights
stretch forever, an endless net of illumination and darkness.
A
coyote HOWLS on the dark hill.
132.
POLICE STATION.
NIGHT.
132.
A palm frond scuttles across the center of the parking lot.
LT
THOMPSON arrives in an unmarked car.
COP (passing)
Lieutenant Thompson -- what
you doing in at this time?
LT THOMPSON
Can't sleep, thought I'd come
break up the poker game.
The COP laughs and goes his way.
THOMPSON's smile evaporates.
133.
ELM STREET.
NIGHT.
134.
The neighborhood is utterly still, most of the homes already
dark.
But not NANCY's.
Or GLEN's.
ZOOM TO GLEN'S LIGHTED LIVING ROOM WINDOW.

floor bedroom and

NANCY'S HOUSE AND ELM STREET.
NIGHT.
144.
The sky has gathered in greater darkness.
LOW, DISTANT THUNDER
rolls around the horizon like a great drum.
ANGLE ON NANCY'S HOUSE from across the street.
The moon glints
off the barred windows. CAMERA ZOOMS to NANCY's window.
The
imprisoned girl hovers in the darkness behind the grill like a
ghost, her eyes turned towards GLEN's.
Then she switches to
something much CLOSER TO CAMERA ANGLE, and she draws back.
145.
REVERSE ON GLEN's father, standing on the front porch of his
145.
home, also in the shadows, looking straight across and up at
NANCY.
He 	draws on his cigarette; his face glows red.
146.
NANCY pulls down the shade.
146.
147.
GLEN's father grinds the cigarette beneath his shoe.
147.
MRS LANTZ
Shouldn't stare.
As the man turns our SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL MRS LANTZ.
MR LANTZ
Know what I think?
I think
that kid's some kinda lunatic.
The woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her
forehead.
MRS LANTZ
Shouldn't say such a thing about
the poor child.
If you mean the
bars, Marge's just being cautious,
her being alone and Nancy acting
so nervous lately.
The woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room.
As
he goes inside he takes one last look.
MR LANTZ (CONTD)
Well, she ain't gonna hang around
our boy no more.
Once the two are inside, the door is locked.
148.
ELM STREET.
NIGHT.
IN NANCY'S POV THROUGH THE BARS we ZOOM directly across to GLEN's
window.
156.
ELM STREET.
NIGHT.
165.
The SOUND of the SCREAM CROSS-FADES WITH the WAIL of the
AMBULANCE as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two
BLACK AND WHITES and an UNMARKED CAR.
Uniformed POLICEMEN spill
out FOREGROUND.
LT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car.
By habit or by
premonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home.
His
eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs
window, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through
her bars.
She gives a little wave.
Unnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's
home.
MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we
can hear the mother's WAILING inside.
166.
THE HEAVENS.
NIGHT.
180E.
CLOSE ANGLE ON NANCY as she curves like a swan though her
apogee, and begins falling, diving, planing through black air,
the wind ripping at her hair and eyes.
Suddenly the complex,
glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen
from the air slides INTO FRAME, and we see she's falling from
high, high over the earth.
NANCY falls, falls in slow motion against the spinning lights,
free as a sky diver freefalling -- a giddy, acrophobic plunge.

185.
ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOUSE.
NIGHT.
185.
NANCY crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just
outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched
and bloodied.
If she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass
of broken bones -- but somehow she's able to claw her way up and
look at her watch once more.
INSERT.
Just a few seconds from zero.
She staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later
KRUEGER crashes down atop her!
NANCY struggles to her knees just
as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades.
But
instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes
him in a desperate bearhug!
The surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him
--and they fall into the jumble of torn-down trellis of roses
beneath her window.
Almost at that very second we HEAR the
jarring, deafening RINGING of NANCY's alarm clock!
SMASH CUT TO:
186.
ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME.
NIGHT.
188.
HIGH ANGLE at the second floor level.
NANCY jerks open the
window to her MOTHER's bedroom and jams her face to the bars.
The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN
as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard.
NANCY
Help!
Hey -- Daddy -- I got
him trapped!
Where are you!?
189.
ANGLE ON the street.
PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees
189.
NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and
screaming like a lunatic.
But her meaning is utterly lost in the
noise of the ambulance next to him.
PARKER
(yelling up at her)
Everything's going to be all
right!
Everything's under
control!
ANGLE at the window.
Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his
response.
NANCY
Get my father, you asshole!
PARKER does a little take.
That almost sounded sane.
PARKER (OS)
You heard what I said!
Now get
back inside or I'll tell your
dad!
191.
Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS.
NANCY whirls around just in time
191.
to see KRUEGER bull in!
NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped
against the bars and has nowhere to go.
The man bunches his
knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing.
NANCY
closes her eyes --
Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two.
MARGE
No!
She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives.
Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars
behind.
Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand,
keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!
MARGE
Nancy -- for god's sake's run!
But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father.
NANCY
Daddy!
Where are you!
192.
ELM STREET.
NIGHT.
192.
PARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house,
sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window.
Something begins to dawn on the man.
Just a little.
PARKER
Poor woman's got her hands full
with that kid.
Maybe I better
tell the lieutenant.
He turns and jogs towards GLEN's house.
193.
NANCY'S HOME.
NIGHT.
201.
CRASH as NANCY breaks another window and presses against the
bars.
The house shudders and glows orange behind her.
She sees
her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house!
NANCY
DAD!
GET US OUTTA HERE!
LT THOMPSON
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!
(to his men)
Hey!
We got a fire!
202.
ANGLE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR.
Many MEN batter the door down as
202.
black smoke pours from the windows and NANCY's SCREAMS and SHOUTS
fill the air.
Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT
THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms.
But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the
front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild
woman.
NANCY
I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!
THOMPSON stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then
runs in after her.
The others follow, coughing and choking.
203.
ELM STREET.
DAY.
209.
CLOSE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR AS NANCY jerks it open and blinks in
the bright, diffused light.
The MUSIC FADES on a transitional
note, into light.
We hear BIRDS.
CHILDREN playing.
Early morning SOUNDS.
NANCY
(to herself)
God, it's bright.
MARGE sticks her head out, squinting, and nods.
Sober.
MARGE
Gonna burn off soon or it
wouldn't be so bright.
NANCY turns and looks her mother over.
NANCY
Feeling better?
MARGE
They say you've bottomed out
when you can't remember the
night before.
(shakes her head)
No more drinking, Baby, suddenly
I just don't feel like it
any more.
She touches NANCY.
MARGE (CONTD)
Didn't keep you up last night,
did I?
You look a little
peeked.
NANCY smiles.
NANCY
Nah.
Just slept heavy.
The girl gives a wave and goes off.
MARGE calls after.
MARGE
See ya.
NANCY turns and waves.
NANCY
See ya.
210.
WIDER ON NANCY as she walks to the curb.
The whole scene is
210.
wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse.
We notice
that NANCY's house no longer has bars on its windows.
Then we
see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down.
TINA
and ROD are in the back seat.
They all wave to MARGE as NANCY
climbs in.
GLEN
(calling)
You believe this fog?
MARGE
(laughs)
I believe anything's possible.
TINA slaps five with NANCY.
TINA
Lookin' good, girl!
ANGLE INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE.
GLEN slips into the seat next to
NANCY.
Someone else is driving, it seems.
NANCY looks up to the
DRIVER.
The big MAN turns and grins at NANCY, a terrible,
scarred, hideous leer of a grin -- FRED KRUEGER'S grin!
ANGLE BACK OUTSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE as its top clamps over the
kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast
and hard as a beartrap!
NANCY'S frightened face flies to the
window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away
from the curb and into the thick fog.
211.
CAMERA PANS TO a group of LITTLE GIRLS, half-hidden by the fog,

jumping rope and singing gayly.
GIRLS
One two --
Freddy's coming for you!
Three four --
Better lock your door!
Five six --
Get your Crucifix
Seven eight --
Gonna stay up late!
