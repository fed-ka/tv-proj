                    the spheres, we could act in
                    accordance with that order.  Rather 
                    than struggle uselessly against it. 


      We re LOW ANGLE on the deck of the parking lot, staring up at
    the modern store.

                    Nowadays, the lights of the city
                    outshine those in the heavens...

      SECURITY LIGHTS buzz overhead.  It s mostly empty at this
      late hour, only a dozen or so cars in the lot, as --

      A GRAY LUXURY SUV

      Breaks frame, coming to a stop near the front. 

      CLOSER - LEWIS PARKS

      Steps out of the vehicle.  In his 40s, balding and heavyset,
      he s dressed casually for a late-night errand.  He absently
      clicks his KEY FOB on his way in.

      HEADLIGHTS flash, LOCKS engage. Ka-chunk.


      Steven walks outside, his mind still on this strange
      incident.  He pulls a KEY FOB from his pocket and aims it at
    the gray luxury SUV we saw before.

    We hear the familiar BEEP BEEP of an alarm disengaging, but
      when he tries the handle, the car is STILL LOCKED.  Confused, 
    he presses the fob again. 

    In the next row over, ANOTHER CAR FLASHES its HIGH BEAMS.  
      Steven looks over, realizing he s at the wrong car. 

    He sighs and shakes his head at his mistake, about to go to
    his own gray luxury SUV, when - 

      REFLECTED IN THE GLASS, a FIGURE rises over Steven s 
      shoulder, CLOSE BEHIND HIM.  He sees this, starts to turn, 
      when - 

      A PLASTIC BAG is LOOPED OVER HIS HEAD and PULLED TIGHT 
      AGAINST HIS NECK. 

    In TIGHTLY FRAMED CUTS, we see: Steven s HANDS go to his 
      throat, struggling.  His BAG falls to the ground, groceries 
      tumbling out.  Steven s FEET kick, as he fights for his life.  
      GLOVED HANDS pull tighter on the improvised garrote.

    We get WIDER GLIMPSES of the violence in reflective surfaces:
    the side view mirror, the shiny dark hood of the car.  Until:

      With one final spasm, Steven whacks the driver s side door.
    The CAR ALARM explodes in the night as...

    The Figure hurriedly exits, Steven s INERT BODY collapsing on 
    the ground. 

      CLOSE - THE LITTLE HOROSCOPE TUBE rolls to a stop big in 
      frame, unopened.

                                        ACT ONE


    An n.d. FLEET SEDAN pulls to a stop outside the parking lot, 
      PERRI REED and JAIN McMANUS exiting, mid-conversation.  As 
      they walk:

                                  MCMANUS
                    And he didn t tell you what the
                    story was?

                                  REED
                    He said it was a homicide.  A man 
                    strangled here last night.

                                  MCMANUS
                    I know that s the story.  I m 
                    saying what s the story? 

      Reed smiles.

                                  REED
                    You mean Kolchak s story?

                                  MCMANUS
                    It can t just be simple homicide if
                    he s interested.  There s got to be
                    something... weird about it.

                                  REED
                    That s what makes life interesting,
                    isn t it?  The finding out.

    As they exit PAST CAMERA:

      ANGLE - CARL KOLCHAK 

      RISES into frame, studying last night s gray luxury SUV from 
      outside a line of yellow POLICE TAPE. 

    The crime scene has been thoroughly investigated, only a
      FORENSICS EXPERT, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER, and a couple
      UNIFORMED COPS left at this hour.  As Reed and McManus 
      approach from behind:

                                  REED
                    Good morning, Carl.

      Kolchak turns, pleasant, but his mind clearly working.
      Focused on the mystery that he s discovered here.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  7.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Morning.

                                  MCMANUS
                    What do you have?

      Kolchak s walking around the perimeter of the police tape,
      observing.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t know.

                                  MCMANUS
                          (disappointed)
                    You don t know?

      Reed consults her reporter s note pad.

                                  REED
                    The police wire said this man,
                    Steven Teague, 42, was strangled
                    with a plastic grocery bag.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Outside another shopper s car.  No 
                    witnesses, no security camera, no
                    motive.  Not yet anyway.

                                  MCMANUS
                          (hopeful)
                    There s got to be something...
                    weird about it.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Oh, there s something weird
                    alright.   Plastic gray whale. 

      McManus looks to Reed.  Confused by this.

                                  REED
                    Plastic gray whale?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    According to the police, a bag boy,
                    George Cawley, told the victim he 
                    was going to die.  Only moments
                    later, he did.

                                  REED
                    He was threatening him...?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  8.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Or warning him, possibly. It s not
                    clear.  Detective Tan is 
                      questioning him now.

                                  MCMANUS
                    And how does  plastic gray whale 
                    fit in?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Those are words he said to the 
                    victim before he told him he d die.

                                  REED
                    What do they have to do with
                    anything?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m not sure.  But...

      McManus smiles to Reed, getting excited.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We know the victim was strangled
                    with a plastic bag.   Plastic. 
                          (indicates car)
                    And the car where he was attacked. 
                    Its color...

                                  MCMANUS
                          (with growing interest)
                    Gray...

      Reed smiles, enjoying the game, but not really convinced.

                                  REED
                    So where s the  whale? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Check out the license plate.

      Reed and McManus turn.  The plate bears the frame,  I got a
      WHALE of a deal at OCEAN WAY MOTORS,  with a WHALE logo. 

                                  MCMANUS
                          (impressed, excited)
                    Plastic... gray... whale. Weird.

      Kolchak looks to Reed.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  9.

5 CONTINUED: (3) 5


                                  REED
                    Maybe you re right... But how could
                    this bag boy have known?  And why
                    give the victim such obscure clues? 

      Kolchak sees Detective STEVEN TAN exiting the store, walking
    to his squad car.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t know. 
                          (to the Detective)
                    Detective Tan.

    Tan sighs.  His wariness suggesting he s familiar with
      Kolchak, his strange questions.  Doesn t like him.  At all. 
    He keeps walking, forcing them to follow.

                                  TAN
                    Mr. Kolchak... 
                          (nothing against her)
                    Perri.  Been awhile.

                                  REED
                    Detective.

                                  KOLCHAK 
                    Are you done questioning the bag
                    boy, George Cawley?

                                  TAN
                    You could say that, yes.

                                  REED
                    Do you consider him a suspect?

                                  TAN
                    No, I can t say we do.

      Tan s practically smiling to himself as he says this.  Some 
      kind of hidden meaning behind his few words.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    How do you explain his telling the
                    victim he was going to die? 

                                  MCMANUS
                    And  plastic gray whale? 

    Tan stops, regards them.  A cat-swallowed-the-canary gleam in
    his eye.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  10.

                    Why don t you go in and ask him
                    yourself? 

    Off Reed, wondering at the Detective s attitude:

                    her contact us?  It s urgent.

                                  LEWIS
                          (he won t)
                    Yeah, right.

      Kolchak and Reed start off.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  27.

                                  REED
                    That was a complete waste of time.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Maybe not.

    Off Reed, wondering what Kolchak s thinking...


    The SUV rolls out of the car wash, the cycle complete.  Still 
    in neutral, it DRIFTS a few yards, then stops. 

      A car wash ATTENDANT, seeing this, turns and goes to the car. 

      ANGLE - THE CAR

      Cheryl s head is still slumped against the driver s window.
      From outside, it looks like she s fallen asleep. 

    The Attendant TAPS on the glass.  Getting no answer, he OPENS
    THE DOOR. 

      Cheryl s LIFELESS BODY slumps out, her hand flopping toward 
    the door.  BLOOD DRIPS past her wedding ring down her
      fingers, MINGLING with the SOAP AND WATER on the ground. 

    The Gloved Man is long gone.

                                      ACT THREE


      A NEWSSTAND filled with glossies.  The Gloved Man reads a 
      SPORTS BETTING MAGAZINE when he stops, noticing... The Daily
      Star tabloid featuring George on the cover.

    The Gloved Man picks it up, scans the headline --  The Man
    Who Knew Too Much  -- with growing unease, then opens it.
      WORDS, IMAGES in the story registering:

      CLOSE - THE PAPER.  Amazing gift to fight crime ...  helping 
      detectives identify a suspect.  PHOTOGRAPHS of GEORGE in his 
      room.

      CLOSE - THE GLOVED MAN

      Swallowing.  Silently unnerved. 

      ANGLE - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF A MOVING SQUAD CAR

    We see the Gloved Man standing at the curb, racking focus
      to... a MUG PHOTO of the Gloved Man on a dashboard laptop.

      RESUME - THE GLOVED MAN

      Looking up from the tabloid to see a SQUAD CAR PULL to a stop
    at the curb.

    The Gloved Man turns away from the Squad Car, and begins to
      walk away with false, but determined, casualness.

    The lights of the Squad Car FLASH.  The Gloved Man picks up
    his pace.  The Cop exits the Squad Car.

                                  COP
                    Sir, stop right there. 

      But, the Gloved Man breaks into a sprint.  The cop
      successfully tackles him to the ground, making quick work of
      CUFFING his hands behind his back.  

                                  COP
                    You re under arrest.  Suspicion of
                    murder.

                                  GLOVED MAN
                    How d you find me?  How d you find
                    me?





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  48.

    The Cop pulls the Gloved Man to his feet, escorting him to
    the squad car. 

      CLOSE ON the Gloved Man s CUFFED WRISTS.  With his right hand,
    the Gloved Man -- slowly, impossibly -- TWISTS HIS LEFT HAND 
    360 DEGREES.  It completely DETACHES.  It s a prosthetic hand,
      PLASTIC. 

    On the unsuspecting cop, speaking into his car radio.

                                  COP
                    Unit two.  Suspect in custody.

      Behind him, the Gloved Man, makes a move for the cop s gun,
      ripping it from its holster.  The cop spins...

      COP S POV: As the gun fires at CAMERA.  Off this:

25 - 27 OMITTED 25 - 27


      Kolchak s Mustang pulls to a stop on the street.  Kolchak and 
      Reed crossing to find... Erik and George, unloading groceries
      from the car.

                                  REED
                    Mr. Cawley? May we have a word?
                          (beat)
                    Hey, George.

      George cocks his head, but it s hard to tell whether he s
      acknowledging Reed or not.  Erik turns to him.

                                  ERIK
                    George.  Go on inside.

      George does as he s told.  Erik turning back to face them.

                                  ERIK
                    What is it you want?

                                  REED
                    It s about the story your wife gave
                    to that tabloid - 

                                  ERIK
                    She shouldn t have done that. 
                    She knows that now.  We just want
                    to be left alone. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  49.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That may not be so easy.

                                  ERIK
                    Why not?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    The police have identified a
                    suspect in these deaths George
                    predicted.

                                  REED
                    An ex-con by the name of Jonas
                    Weems.  Apparently, he scrapes out
                    a living killing people for hire.

                                  ERIK
                    If they know who he is, they can
                    arrest him.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    They tried.  He shot a police
                    officer and narrowly escaped.
                          (beat)
                    It s possible he could have seen
                    the story that identified George.

                                  ERIK
                    You think he d come after him?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    If he believes George is helping
                    the police find him, he just might.

      Erik digests this, thinking about what George said to him
      before. 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I know George wasn t able to pick
                    his face out of the mug book, but
                    George has a way of identifying
                    this man.

                                  REED
                    He said  plastic  when warning the
                    first two victims.  We ve learned 
                    the suspect has a prosthetic hand.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    And wears a plastic sleeve over it.

    On Eric, newly concerned.

                                  ERIK
                    Last night, George said something
                    to me as we were leaving the police
                    station.   Dark baseball plastic. 
                          (beat)
                    He said I was going to die.

    In spite of himself, Erik s a little rattled by this.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Mr. Cawley, I think you should get 
                    your wife and brother out of here.

                                  ERIK
                    I m not going anywhere.  The police
                    would have contacted me if there 
                    were any real danger.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Maybe I m scaring you for nothing,
                    but your brother successfully
                    predicted two deaths this week. I 
                    don t want you to be the third.

                                  ERIK
                    Those tabloids are full of crazy
                    stories, Mr. Kolchak.  I appreciate
                    your concern, but I think we re fine.

      Erik goes, leaving a troubled Kolchak and Reed looking after
      him:


      Kolchak and Reed head back to his Mustang. 

                                  REED
                    What do you think we should do?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Call Detective Tan.  See if he ll 
                    put a surveillance car on.

                                  REED
                    And if he won t?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George s other predictions came
                    true within 24 hours.  We may not
                    have long to wait to see if this
                    one does, too.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  51.

      UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

    Of Kolchak and Reed, getting into the Mustang.  WE ANGLE OVER 
    to reveal... the Gloved Man, lurking unseen.  Watching them.
    As he exits frame:

    At a UTILITY BOX, the Gloved Man FLIPS SWITCHES, CUTTING 
      POWER. 


    The Gloved Man steals to the back of the house.    NIGHT STALKER  "ASCENDANT"  YELLOW REVISIONS  11/11/2005  53.




    The Gloved Man expertly JIMMIES THE DOOR OPEN, using a lock-
      pick device.  A QUIET UNLATCHING, and he s in. 


      Kolchak and Reed RAP LOUDLY on the door. 


    Now a crime scene.  A SQUAD CAR departs, with the Gloved Man
    in custody.  GEORGE S BODY is wheeled away.  REVEAL Kolchak, 
      somber.  He exchanges a look with Detective Tan, as Tan joins
      Erik and Marla at the front door.

      ANGLE ON Reed leaning against the Mustang.Kolchak joins
      her.  They re both silent for a long time. Then:

                                  REED
                    You think we were wrong?  About 
                    George being able to read the
                    stars?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t.

                                  REED
                    Then why did he die?  Why not Erik?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    George tried to change fate.  And I 
                    think, somehow... he did.

      Reed looks at Kolchak, then turns her head skyward, looking
    up at the night. From her POV, we see the infinite field of
      stars, shining brightly.

      OVER THIS:
