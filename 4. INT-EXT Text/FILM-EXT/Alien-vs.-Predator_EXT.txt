DEEP SPACE
We OPEN on TOTAL BLACKNESS, a sea of stars spread across the infinite
depths of space.
As the TITLES ROLL, we notice that three of these
specks seem to be moving; one of them picking up acceleration and
racing toward us.
Our perspective changes, and we catch a quick
glimpse as it HURTLES past, and into the gravitational pull of a large
brownish planet.
Kicking up SPARKS of FRICTION as it hits atmosphere.
It seems to be manmade.
Or at least artificial.
PLANET SURFACE - DAY
The planet is dead, barren.
Death Valley on a grand scale.
We watch
the object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover, emitting a few last
burning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance.
A
BOOMING ECHO resonates across the dusty plains, before settling back
into an eerie silence.
FISSURE CANYON - DAY
We're looking into a deep gorge, dark and sinister.
A howling wind
whips dust into a sandstorm, reducing visibility to almost zero.
About
seventy feet down there's a hole in the rock-face that just might be a
cave entrance, and near is a peculiar SHIMMERING in the air.
We hear a
mechanical BEEPING and the SHIMMERING disappears, replaced by FIVE
humanoid SHAPES clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet
tall.
They are PREDATORS, a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on
permanent safari; their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of
aborigine and ultra-hi-tech.
In their hands are circular metal discs;
'smart weapons' which cut into the stone and give them purchase.
PREDATOR-VISION.
From their P.O.V., we see the fissure reduced to THERMAL HEAT SOURCES.
The entrance registers as a black gaping void.
PLANET SURFACE - DAY
A white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure, the result of the
PREDATOR's suicide-destruct mechanism.
The shuttlecraft pulls quickly
away, disappearing into the clouds.
SPACE
A large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet; the
PREDATOR Mothership.
The shuttle heads swiftly towards it.
SPACE
We see a pod ejected from the Mothership, rocketing away from the
planet into deep space.
The inference is obvious; the PREDATORS are
seeding worlds with ALIENS to hunt.
SPACE
In CENTER FRAME, the planet sits still and green, awash with nebulous
clouds. A hulking METAL FORM ROLLS RIGHT-TO-LEFT across our view,
sunlight glinting from it's surface.
It's a rectangular satellite-
construction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a
latticework of steel tubing.
We hear FILTERED HUMAN VOICES O.S.
Subspace chatter.
RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY
Imagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of
treetop foliage, and you've just drawn yourself a picture of the planet
Ryushi.
Nestled amongst this lush rainforest is the Yutani-Templin
Communications Relay Station.
Several inverted-'U'-shaped suspension
cranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of
preassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on
platforms, much like a truncated oil-rig.
A navigation beacon flashes
intermittently from a tall gantry tower above, while dominating the
view is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes
high.
Off to one side of the platform is a gigantic many-wheeled
haulage vehicle.
A flock of bird-like creatures fly past.
RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY
An eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain,
climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outpost's empty
main-street.
A group of rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds
indigenous to Ryushi - restlessly stir in their corral at it's
approach.
The crawler's pneumatics HISS gently as it comes to a halt,
while somewhere off in the distance a dog BARKS.
DON KAMEN, a lean man in his forties. climbs down from the cab mounted
five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna. He
adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the
street towards one of the buildings, ignoring a Pepsi sign CREAKING in
the gentle breeze.
A glass-paneled door SWISHES automatically open
before him.
LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON
Down here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in
gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana
bayou.
A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for
cover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby.
Seconds later,
a loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. and a pair of manta-ray-shaped
hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME
suspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a
swirl of spray.
The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES
scatter.
ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called "good 'ol
boys" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in
the other.
YORK
(yelling)
You missed 'em, Ackland!
ACKLAND
Little fuckers move too fast.
Let's do a sweep and catch 'em on the
other side.
YORK nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes.
The two
bikes ROAR off in pursuit.
LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON
Up on a mud-bank, at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two
blinking blue lights atop it, stands the camp.
It looks a little like
a Bedouin bivouac, but up-close we can see the techno-fitted details.
A hard-featured woman seated next to a solid-fuel burner sips from a
mug, while her Vietnamese counterpart is manually loading large-caliber
bullets into a belt-feed.
They
watch as ACKLAND and YORK roar past WHOOPING.
MINH scrambles out of
the way as a beer can lobbed by YORK CLATTERS to the ground near him.
MINH
Crazy idiots.
BEAUVAIS cups her drink with both hands, assessing him.
BEAUVAIS
Ahhh, they're just letting off some steam; don't let 'em get to you.
Ackland and York aren't such bad guys when you get to know 'em.
Just a
couple of weekend warriors...
She peers curiously at the clunky cartridges MINH's thumbing into the
belt feed.
On the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over-
the-shoulder guidance mechanism.
BEAUVAIS (CONT'D)
Nice howitzer you've got there.
MINH
Thanks.
BEAUVAIS
Good argument for gun-control.
What are you going after, rhino?
MINH
Nah.
I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.
'Sides, they tagged the
rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.
They'll dock
you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
He peers into the belt and blows out some dirt.
MINH (CONT'D)
Sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it,
though.
DEEP SPACE
Against a sea of stars, a small metal shape HURTLES towards us,
followed moments later by it's identical twin.
RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - AFTERNOON
A strand of HIROKO's hair falls forward into her face, slick with rain.
She brushes up at the miserable weather.
She and KAMEN are standing on
one of the twelve-feet-in-diameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage
vehicle we saw outside the base earlier.
Up on the side of the cab is
painted a Nordic Valkyrie with an impressive bustline, next to which is
the legend 'BIG BERTHA'.
Two mechanics, JAN GUTTIEREZ and KEVIN
DILLER, watch KAMEN point something out to HIROKO from the vantage
point of KAMEN's crawler parked in the swamp nearby.
KAMEN
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.
Same thing with the
pumps on the base air purifiers.
The algae out here just isn't good on
these new plastics.
HIROKO
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module.
That was four months ago.
I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares
in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
KAMEN shrugs.
KAMEN
If you want these things kept in working condition, that's the only
choice you've got.
DILLER leans in to murmur quietly to GUTTIEREZ.
DILLER
Maybe she wouldn't be so tetchy if she got laid every once-in-a-while.
GUTTIEREZ
You offering?
A buzzer inside the crawler goes OFF.
DILLER gets up to answer.
DILLER
Nah.
Freeze my dick off.
HIROKO shakes her head dubiously at KAMEN's comment.
HIROKO
I don't know.
I think we'll have to run it on a rota; one month down,
one month operational.
DILLER leans out of the crawler's cab and calls across.
DILLER
Miss Noguchi!
You're wanted in admin.
HIROKO
Thanks.
She turns back to KAMEN.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Let me sort this out and we'll go over the logistics in my office.
SPACE
A cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites,
and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move.
DEEP SPACE
The two pods ROAR towards us at immense speed.
SPACE
Framed against the green backdrop of Ryushi, the PREDATOR pods rocket
towards the communications platform.
CASSIE
Picking up velocity.
HIROKO
Match it!
A bead of sweat trickles down PARSONS' temple.
PARSONS
Not gonna make it...
DEEP SPACE
The pod speeds THUNDEROUSLY into CAMERA, blotting out our view.
SPACE
The mass of the satellite tumbles end-over-end.
A gaping rent is torn
through it; something sparks and flashes within.
The second pod
accelerates off curving into the atmosphere.
LINSON'S RANGE - RIVERBANK - DUSK
A SONIC THUNDERCRACK BOOMS overhead; YORK looks up in time to see an
object sear across the dusk sky.
He pulls his bike to a stationary
hover.
YORK
Shit!
What's that?
ACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the
ground.
A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the forest, followed by a few
plaintive SCREECHES from the planet's indigenous lifeforms, before
settling back into an eerie silence.
ACKLAND
Meteor, I guess.
He raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face.
THROUGH THEM
he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops.
ACKLAND
D'you feel any impact shock?
YORK
(uncertain)
Not really.
He lowers the binoculars and frowns.
ACKLAND
Me either.
I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto,
and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
YORK
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
ACKLAND
(hesitant)
I dunno... I dunno.
Something about this feels funny.
He looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky.
ACKLAND (CONT'D)
That is the damndest impact I've ever saw...
LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DUSK
The earth around the crater-rim is charred and cracked; some of the
surrounding brush still aflame.
A SCORPION scuttles inquisitively to
the edge of the pit and stops, it's stinger twitching hesitantly.
We
HEAR a LOW HUM, and the SOUND of METAL-ON-METAL.
Before the SCORPION
can decide what to do, it's fate is sealed.
A large METAL CLAW comes
down, crushing it in an instant.
A SECOND CLAW emerges, and a MACHINE
heaves itself out of the hole, it's surface smoking with heat.
It
pauses for a BEAT like some giant tarantula seeking prey, them moves
purposely outwards about twenty yards before halting.
A hatch on the
underside opens, and a complex delivery mechanism extends.
After a
moment there's a LOW CLUNK, and the mechanism retracts.
In it's place
is an ALIEN EGG.
The MACHINE crawls off, vanishing into the long
reeds.
RYUSHI STATION - NIGHT
HIROKO sits on the front wheel of KAMEN's crawler, her knees pulled up
to her chin, staring off into a thin mist that makes the night
impenetrable.
Behind and above, the lights of the cranes and the
communications array strobe on-and-off.
Above the bar on the main
street is a flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact, emblazoned with
the words "TORCHY'S".
The MUFFLED SOUNDS of MERRY-MAKING from within
become momentarily louder, and HIROKO glances over to see it's
pressure-door CRASH back, disgorging several drunken people. KAMEN
follows them through.
He spots HIROKO and heads over.
KAMEN
Hey, boss.
Wondered where you'd gotten to.
HIROKO
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.
Clear my head.
KAMEN
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
She shakes her head, and manages a smile.
HIROKO
I've got a lot of thinking to do.
'Sides, the room was getting too
crowded for me.
KAMEN
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
HIROKO
No, not really.
More sort of the
'claustrophobic' type.
KAMEN LAUGHS.
HIROKO is straight-faced.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
I'm serious.
That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary
installations.
KAMEN
Is that a fact.
HIROKO
Uh-huh.
Used to get it pretty bad.
I'd wake up in a cold sweat and
want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
KAMEN
How long you been out here for now, anyway?
Three months?
HIROKO
Four.
KAMEN
And before that?
HIROKO
Six month stint on Datus.
KAMEN
Only six?
HIROKO
What is this?
'Twenty Questions'?
KAMEN
Just curious.
There's a lot of talk goes around.
HIROKO shrugs.
Thinks about it.
HIROKO
I don't know.
I guess I've just never found anywhere I really felt at
home.
She hugs her knees again, and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease.
KAMEN spots a square glass balanced on one of the tire's wide treads.
KAMEN
What is that?
HIROKO
Real man' drink.
She offers the glass to him.
He takes it and sniff cautiously.
KAMEN
Seltzer?
HIROKO
Want some?
KAMEN hands the glass back and raises his own bottle.
KAMEN
I'll stick with my own.
He sits with her and stares into the darkness.
HIROKO
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
KAMEN
Nothing.
With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain
range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
HIROKO
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
KAMEN
'We'?
You wanna fly out there with me?
HIROKO
Sure.
Do me good to stretch my legs.
HIROKO takes a sip of her drink, her brow furrowing.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
This whole thing's got me spooked.
KAMEN hops off the wheel.
KAMEN
Don't worry about it.
If the Network goes by the book, like everyone
figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look-
see in four-or-five days.
They can go poke around out there and find
whatever it was hit us.
All we've gotta do is sit tight.
HIROKO
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
KAMEN
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
SPACE
A peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the
incapacitated satellite, examining every section.
it comes to the rent
torn through it, and pauses.
FROM THE SCANNER'S P.O.V., we see the structure of the satellite made
up from a series of blue geodesic shapes.
The damage registers as a
cold, black mass.
The beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly
on it's axis, thrusting towards the planet.
LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT
Shafts of torch-light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness.
YORK and ACKLAND wade through the chin-high reeds, cursing.
ACKLAND
Found anything?
YORK looks down at his data-stick, a handheld torch with a multi-
purpose readout screen.
YORK
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
ACKLAND
Well, just keep looking.
It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
ACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running.
YORK
What is it?
ACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the
rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground.
ACKLAND
It's a rhino.
YORK
Is it dead?
ACKLAND
No, it's still breathing.
Kinda clammy though.
Are you sure your
stick's not broken.
YORK looks at the data-stick again.
YORK
Yeah, it's fine.
ACKLAND
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
YORK
I told you we... what's that?
Their torch beams PAN ACROSS a three-foot high ovular shape.
ACKLAND
Looks like a spore.
Fungus of some kind, maybe?
YORK
Bloody big if it is.
Top's open.
ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside.
YORK (CONT'D)
Careful...
There's nothing inside.
ACKLAND looks disappointed.
ACKLAND
It's hollow.
Think our rhino must've ate something that didn't agree
with him.
A heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a
BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair.
YORK
Let's get back and call this in.
ACKLAND
Wait a minute.
YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing
foliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater.
It's beginning to
partially collapse, water seeping in.
YORK runs his beam over
something at the bottom of the shallow pit.
YORK
What is that... is that metal fragments?
ACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now.
ACKLAND
This is very fucking weird.
He sees the churned earth, and the muddy trail leading off into the
broken foliage.
ACKLAND (CONT'D)
It's like something came out of the crater and went that way...
There's a TINY CLICK, and ACKLAND looks over to see YORK taking the
safety off his rifle.
ACKLAND wordlessly unshoulders his too.
They
step around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to...
YORK
Another one?
ACKLAND prods this SECOND EGG with his gun.
ACKLAND
Yeah.
This's closed.
There's a CRACKLING NOISE, and the top of the EGG peels neatly open in
four sections.
The two men jump back in alarm, and YORK LAUGHS
nervously. Something organic is pulsing inside.
ACKLAND cranes his
neck forward for a better look...
There's an EXPLOSION of MOVEMENT.
A spindly shape with a long
segmented tail launches itself jack-in-a-box-style at ACKLAND.
It's a
FACEHUGGER.
ACKLAND trips backwards, caught off-balance.
His finger
involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls.
A volley
of shots describe and arc and
light up the night with a PERCUSSIVE
BOOM, and we...
CUT TO
...A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING.
SOMETHING is watching them
from the trees; something with a heat-vision P.O.V.
A PREDATOR.
We
see the flare of ACKLAND's gunshots, then SNAP IN to see the multi-
colored from of his body toppling over, trailing a purplish FACEHUGGER,
before we...
CUT BACK TO
...One of ACKLAND's bullets taking a meaty chunk out of YORK's thigh as
he races forward to help his friend.
The HUGGER's tail is already
around ACKLAND's throat, it's fingers scrabbling for purchase.
YORK
pulls at one set of digits, and manages to raise them for just an
instant.
What we see is horrific; the look of terror on ACKLAND's
face, and the questing tendril on
the HUGGER's underside trying to force it's way between ACKLAND's lips.
In a second, it's all over; the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORK's
grasp, and clamps itself firmly on ACKLAND's face with a faint SUCKING
SOUND.
YORK shivers, then uses his good leg to propel himself a few
feet away.
He watches the hapless Teamster go rigid, then stop moving
altogether.
YORK
Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God.
The FACEHUGGER's tail slithers tighter around ACKLAND's neck; and as
YORK quickly retrieves his rifle, we...
CUT TO
A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching the color-bloom of YORK dragging
ACKLAND's body away from the crater.
It CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER,
giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of circulatory fluid pumping around
the HUGGER and into ACKLAND.
YORK's limping badly, a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue
trousers. ACKLAND's not a small man, and the physical effort of hauling
him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely.
There's movement on
the ground, and YORK sees why; one of the LEMURS has fallen victim to
another FACEHUGGER, which dwarfs it's small furry body.
The HUGGER's
fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens it's hold; the
movement akin to somebody drumming their
fingers on a table-top.
LINSON'S RANGE - RIVER BANK - NIGHT
As YORK hauls ACKLAND onto one of the bikes, he hears a TICKING SOUND
from the trees, like an engine cooling on a warm summer's day.
YORK
clutches his rifle and stares upward.
There seems to be a VAGUE
SHIMMERING FORM in the bough of a tree.
Although it might be a trick
of the light, he isn't sticking around to find out.
YORK guns the bike
to life and ROARS off above the swamp.
LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT
PREDATOR-VISION.
We're looking at the site in colours:
the cold blue of empty ALIEN
EGGS, and the warm reds of just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the
FACEHUGGER parasites.
A group of PREDATORS appear in three-dimensional solidity, their
camouflage cloaks deactivated.
The LEAD PREDATOR SPLASHES across to
the exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an ANIMAL CORPSE
curled up there.
Most of it has been madly mutilated by something
erupting from inside it's body. The PREDATOR looks up and scans the
swamp, ignoring the swarm of FLIES buzzing in the air.
PREDATOR-VISION.
This time, an oscillating line appears to the left of our view, and a
band sweeps quickly ACROSS the screen synchronous to us hearing
different levels of SOUND STATIC.
This abruptly stops as the
oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys.
The PREDATOR is
picking up radio
waves.
A HUMAN VOICE; albeit grossly-distorted.
LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
We hear a RAPID BEEPING; movement-sensors set up on tripods to warn
against intruding animals.
The sound brings BEAUVAIS out of her tent,
bleary-eyed and fumbling with her pistol.
She's suddenly wide awake
when she sees YORK's hover-bike, lit by the sensors' flashing red
strobe.
It skids to a halt against a mud-bank, sending up a spray of
silt.
YORK climbs off the bike and stumbles, then starts to unfasten
the straps holding ACKLAND's body.
BEAUVAIS
Jesus Christ!
What happened?
YORK
Give me a hand with Ack.
She races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up.
BEAUVAIS
How bad is... oh my God.
As ACKLAND is turned over, BEAUVIAS gets her first look at a
FACEHUGGER. She shies away, repulsed.
BEAUVAIS
What is that?
YORK
Don't... uuh... don't know.
Help me... uuh... help me get him inside.
Shit!
YORK grits his teeth, but the leg injury is too painful.
He slumps
slowly to the floor.
BEAUVAIS
(yelling)
Minh!
Minh, get out here!
LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
MINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of
the camp, the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward.
He
studies the surrounding darkness.
There's nothing out there.
He
shakes his head in
disgust.
MINH
(muttering)
Take a goddamn wrench to those things...
He thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'.
There's a gentle WHINE,
and the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the
weapon up. It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a
target.
We see MINH's hand in CLOSE UP.
In addition to the firing
trigger, there's also a thumb button.
He squeezes it...
The gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking
something automatically.
There's a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off
three shots in rapid succession.
Something that was only yards from
MINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole, a
mass of luminous green liquid and motion.
MINH (CONT'D)
(dumbstruck)
God.
MINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a
SPLASH, then lie motionless.
YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in
an instant.
PREDATOR-VISION.
Three humans; in motion and 'hot'.
The triangular mechanism of the
PREDATOR's gun locks onto MINH.
A BLAST of plasma-energy rips a gaping hole through MINH's body,
spraying blood across YORK.
He topples dead to the ground, a look of
pained surprise on his face.
BEAUVAIS is there immediately, racing
across and scrabbling for the 'howitzer'.
She doesn't have time to
take the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger
guard and starts squeezing off random shots.
The air shimmers as an
unseen shape races at her.
There's a loud
SWISH of sliding metal, and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air.
It SLAMS through BEAUVAIS' body, lifting her off the ground and
impaling her against a tree.
YORK watches in horror as BEAUVAIS' arms thrash around.
A moment later
her struggles cease, and she'd dropped to the floor like a broken
marionette. There's a CRACKLING SOUND, and the hazy air around BEAUVAIS
disappears.
In it's place is a PREDATOR, a luminous green patch
trickling from a wound on it's arm.
It's head flicks around as it
zeroes-in on YORK, the three red dots of the PREDATOR's cannon
following suit.
YORK's quick though, already up and running when the
plasma bolt EXPLODES into the tree despite the pain in his leg.
His options are limited.
The hover-bike is nearby.
He sprints for
that and his luck holds...the key's still in the ignition.
He flips
it.
The engine COUGHS and then dies.
YORK looks up.
The wounded
PREDATOR bounds across the clearing at frightened speed.
YORK turns
the key again, but the PREDATOR's almost upon him.
The creature WHIPS
an ornately-shaped lance from it's back and thrusts it...JUST AS THE
ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE AND THE HOVER-BIKE RISES FROM THE MUD!
The blade
slices into the bike's body and jams there, while one of it's manta-
wings SMACKS into the PREDATOR's jaw, sending it reeling backwards into
the swamp.
YORK swivels the bike on it's axis as another plasma-bolt rips into the
rear, melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork.
He sees a PREDATOR
handing from a tree, and the SHIMMERING of two more PREDATORS in their
camouflage nearby.
He's not sticking around to argue though.
YORK
jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more
cannon-blasts blossom around him.
The group of PREDATORS appear in the camp and cautiously survey the
area. The LEAD PREDATOR - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses
to the tent and opens the entry flap.
LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
We PAN SLOWLY ACROSS the deserted campsite.
There isn't a soul there,
human or otherwise.
The wind whistles eerily through the tree-boughs.
RAINFOREST AIRSPACE - DAWN
First light the next day, the sun rising on the horizon.
A 'chopper' -
actually a twin-turbine heli-jet - flies in low above the veil of mist
hanging over the treetops.
LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
Twin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep
across the clearing.
The encampment has been wrecked, much of is
reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris.
All-terrain gear lowers
from the chopper, as it makes a watery landing in the swamp.
LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
The two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred
canvas. Part of the bivouac has collapsed - one of the guide ropes has
burned through.
HIROKO
(quietly)
Somebody picked an argument.
KAMEN
Yeah.
Somebody won.
HIROKO
Check out the tent.
KAMEN nods and heads off that way, while HIROKO carefully inspects the
wreckage dotted around the perimeter.
LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
Across the clearing, HIROKO turns a piece of charred plating over in
her hands before discarding it.
Her foot slips on an object sunk into the soft mud.
It's MINH's
'howitzer'. A dark slippery patch coats the metal.
She crouches down
and rubs her fingers through it.
Blood.
KAMEN's VOICE intrudes, O.S.
KAMEN
(O.S.)
I've found Ackland!
HIROKO
Hold on...
She begins to cross the camp, and her foot catches on a taut length of
rope. SOMETHING swings down from the trees, hitting her squarely in the
face and knocking her off her feet.
HIROKO CRIES OUT in fear and
surprise, then freezes at what she sees.
Two bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead; BEAUVAIS
and MINH.
Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition.
KAMEN
hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant.
He stops
in his tracks.
KAMEN
Jesus palomino...
RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - MORNING
It's raining again at the base.
Under cover of an overhang, HIROKO
watches as ACKLAND is trundled away from the 'chopper' on a paramedic
trolley by GUTTIEREZ and DOC REVNA, an Indian woman in her late
thirties.
As KAMEN slams the 'chopper's side door, we see that HIROKO
has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat.
KAMEN runs after
REVNA clutching a clear plastic bag.
KAMEN
Wait a minute, Doc...
He hands the bag over to REVNA.
She peers at the contents curiously.
The FACEHUGGER is inside, stiff and shriveled.
REVNA
Is this it?
KAMEN
Yeah.
Found it curled up in a corner of the tent.
Any idea?
REVNA shakes her head.
REVNA
Never come across one of these before. Maybe the original survey team
did.
I'll run it through records and see what comes up.
GUTTIEREZ checks that ACKLAND's body's secure on the trolley.
KAMEN
raps him on the back to get his attention.
KAMEN
Hey, Jan.
See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
GUTTIEREZ
What's the problem?
KAMEN
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.
Think the turbines
might be playing up.
GUTTIEREZ
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
KAMEN
Appreciate that.
REVNA interrupts.
REVNA
Where're the bodies?
HIROKO
Bagged and in the back.
They're not a pretty sight.
ACKLAND is wheeled into a freight elevator.
As KAMEN and HIROKO walk
away across the rain-swept platform, a SHIMMERING FROM detaches itself
from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the heli-jet pad.
PREDATOR-VISION.
A newly-arrived PREDATOR scans the towers and modules of the relay-
station with great interest.
An oscillating red line appears to the
LEFT of the SHOT as the PREDATOR analyses HIROKO's voice-pattern.
PREDATOR
(O.S., distorted)
Not a pretty sight.
Not a pretty sight...
He reaches down to his wrist computer and activates it.
LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DAY
Under the cathedral-like light filtering through the trees above, a row
of metal spikes have been driven into the earth.
Four are topped with
still-smoking ALIEN skulls.
Two and empty.
PREDATOR-VISION.
A newly decapitated ALIEN head is turned around in another PREDATOR's
hands in admiration.
This PREDATOR thrusts his trophy onto the next
spike, then stares at the vacant one for a long moment.
His wrist
computer BLEEPS for attention...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - AFTERNOON
A metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform.
DILLER leans
against it down by the access ramp, smoking a cigarette and idly
blowing rings into the air.
BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to
quietly SNARL.
DILLER glances down at her curiously.
DILLER
What's the matter, girl?
You smell something?
Now the rhino are restless too.
CASSIE walks across the concrete
roadway to join them.
CASSIE
Rhinos look a little antsy,
BREWSTER stops SNARLS and progresses onwards to full-fledged BARKING.
DILLER
Yeah.
Never seem 'em act like this before.
PREDATOR-VISION.
CASSIE and DILLER are 'warm', but the rhinos are BREWSTER are 'hotter'
still.
Their VOICES and BREWSTER's BARKS are filtered to the point of
unrecognizability, eerily distorted.
CASSIE's the first to hear the SOUND.
CASSIE
Do you hear that?
DILLER straightens up, looking out into the surrounding trees.
It's a
FAINT HUM, getting LOUDER every second.
DILLER
Yeah...
A hoverbike appears, trailing smoke from one of it's turbine intakes as
it hurtles towards the base.
Halfway between the trees and the ramp,
it clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end.
It's rider flies through
the air and hits the swamp face-first.
DILLER and CASSIE race down the
ramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead.
CASSIE
I don't believe it.
DILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the
mire. It's YORK.
Blood has caked around his wounded leg.
DILLER
He looks in a bad way.
Help me get him up to Infirmary.
CASSIE
Wait a minute...
Something else has caught CASSIE's eye.
A "something" almost two
metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike.
Grasping the haft firmly, she works it free.
CASSIE examines the
PREDATOR spear, and slowly shakes her head.
CASSIE (CONT'D)
Holy Mary...
PREDATOR-VISION.
The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the
weapon over in her hands.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
It's late, and the base's exterior lighting casts yellow pools of light
across the metal and concrete thoroughfares.
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES -
a tough-looking Afrikaan woman with a think accent - looks uneasily
about them. Another GROUP of PEOPLE with trackers and guns are
searching around in the BACKGROUND.
Nearby, the vertical yellow column
of a suspension-crane gantry towers high above.
DE VRIES
C'mon, man.
One more sweep.
GUTTIEREZ
One more sweep... one more sweep.
I'm getting tired of one more
fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now,
and found zip.
DE VRIES
Ah, quit griping.
Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
GUTTIEREZ
Hey!
I was in shape before we started doing this.
DE VRIES pauses, listening to the sound from the surrounding forest.
DE VRIES
Listen to that...
GUTTIEREZ cocks his head and listens.
He has no idea what she means.
GUTTIEREZ
Listen to what?
DE VRIES
That's what I mean.
This is the quietest I've ever heard it.
It's
unnatural.
GUTTIEREZ shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable
blackness beyond the confines of the base.
GUTTIEREZ
De Vries?
DE VRIES
Yeah?
GUTTIEREZ
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
BREWSTER the dog stares in fascination at the rhinos through the
meshwork fence of their pens.
The animals move around in agitation.
Not at her, but at something else...
DE VRIES
Something spooking the rhinos?
GUTTIEREZ
I dunno.
RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - DUSK
PREDATOR-VISION.
The rhino's, the dog, and the two humans can be seen way above on the
platform's edge, bright red.
Indistinct inside their camouflage cloaks, the small group of PREDATORS
wade carefully through the water towards the base of the installation.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES walk over to the rhino pen, BREWSTER pulling at
her leash.
GUTTIEREZ frowns at what he sees.
All the rhinos are
nervously huddled together in the far corner.
GUTTIEREZ
That's real peculiar behavior.
DE VRIES fingers a rough metal edge.
DE VRIES
Hey, Guttierez?
GUTTIEREZ
What?
DE VRIES
Take a look at this.
GUTTIEREZ moves over for a closer look.
There's a torn hole in the
meshwork, just big enough for a rhino to squeeze through.
Blood and
fragments of skin coat the edge of the gap.
GUTTIEREZ
One of 'em must have escaped.
DE VRIES
That's impossible, man.
This fence is high-tensile.
The breaking
tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it
up.
GUTTIEREZ shines the flashlight along the deck.
A trail of smeared
blood runs all the way to the perimeter.
The surrounding fence has
been buckled and twisted.
They cross to it and look down at the swamp.
The torch beam sparkles on the murky water far below.
GUTTIEREZ
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
DE VRIES
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
GUTTIEREZ
That's a fact.
GUTTIEREZ' tracker starts to BLEEP.
He raises it excitedly.
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Whoa, wait a minute...
DE VRIES
What?
GUTTIEREZ
Just got a reading...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
GUTTIEREZ sweeps the tracker slowly around, and BREWSTER begins to
gently SNARL.
DE VRIES pulls on the dog's leash to quieten her.
GUTTIEREZ
It's up there somewhere...
He shoulders his rifle.
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Come on.
A metal ladder runs up the side of one of the base buildings.
GUTTIEREZ crosses to it and starts to climb the first few rungs.
DE VRIES
What?
Are you nuts?
Just the two of us?
GUTTIEREZ
I've seen this mother, De Vries.
We can bag it, no problem.
DE VRIES
Forget it, man.
GUTTIEREZ
C'mon De Vries.
Think of the bonus.
DE VRIES
Fuck the bonus.
I hate heights.
You wouldn't get me up there even if
it wasn't night.
GUTTIEREZ starts to climb the ladder.
DE VRIES
What the hell are you doing?
GUTTIEREZ
Hey, fair enough.
If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
DE VRIES runs her fingers through her hair in frustration.
Comes to a
decision counter to what she wants to do...
DE VRIES
Wait a minute!
GUTTIEREZ stops climbing.
DE VRIES (CONT'D)
Alright, okay.
Look...
GUTTIEREZ
What?
DE VRIES
I'll come with you.
BREWSTER BARKS.
She drags the dog over to a metal stanchion and ties
the leash around it.
DE VRIES (CONT'D)
But I'm going first...
GUTTIEREZ
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
She climbs around GUTTIEREZ and begins to ascend the ladder.
BREWSTER
WHIMPERS and plaintively BARKS after them.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
The rooftop is dark, mysterious.
Pieces of retrofitted junk can be
seen in silhouette, edged in light from way below.
DE VRIES and
GUTTIEREZ carefully step over the threshold.
They speak in WHISPERS.
DE VRIES
Careful of that edging there...
GUTTIEREZ
Yeah, I got it.
Although we have an outstanding VIEW of the night lights of the base up
here, the immediate gloom is impenetrable.
DE VRIES
Where's that flashlight?
By way of an answer, a powerful ray cuts a swathe through the air.
DE
VRIES takes the torch from him and shines it on the ground.
Circular
extractor fans rotate quietly in the gloom.
DE VRIES (CONT'D)
Still got him?
GUTTIEREZ
It's moving slow.
About... eleven metres. On the left.
DE VRIES plays the flashlight across the rooftop.
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Little bit further...
The beam comes to rest on a protruding piece of apparatus.
A short-
range antennae, about seven feet wide.
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right there, right behind the antennae.
I think
we're got it cornered...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
HIROKO bends down to inspect a small plastic grating fitted flush with
the roadway.
The broken grillework is melted outwards.
KAMEN and two
other men - CALDWELL and THOMAS - stand behind.
THOMAS
The door to the food storage locker was smashed open.
It must have
come straight out of here.
HIROKO yawns.
HIROKO
Alright.
Keep your eyes peeled.
She voices her concern to KAMEN.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
If it got out of the systems, it could be anywhere.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
It's very quiet, and we can hear the NERVOUS BREATHING of GUTTIEREZ and
DE VRIES as they cautiously stalk forward.
GUTTIEREZ
Hold it, hold it...
DE VRIES
What's wrong?
GUTTIEREZ
I'm picking up another signal.
DE VRIES looks around, unnerved.
DE VRIES
What?
Where?
GUTTIEREZ
Just behind us, over to the right.
DE VRIES shines her beam over the surface of the yellow crane to their
rear, shifting her attention to-and-fro from it and the antennae.
DE VRIES
Can't see a thing.
Are you sure?
GUTTIEREZ
Yeah, I...
The second blip on the small screen abruptly vanishes.
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Wait.
Lost it.
DE VRIES
How?
GUTTIEREZ
I dunno.
Might be a glitch.
From behind the metal disc there comes a SHUFFLING SOUND, followed by a
METALLIC THUNK.
This gets their attention.
The two of them halt in
their tracks.
DE VRIES
Oh, man.
That's no glitch!
GUTTIEREZ
It's alright, it's cool...
DE VRIES
Is it still moving?
GUTTIEREZ
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe.
Nice and easy...
A small many-limbed SHAPE hurls itself from the confines of it's hiding
place with a FERAL SHRIEK.
DE VRIES YELPS in surprise, and looses off
a spray of bullets.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
HIROKO looks up, startled by the sound of GUNFIRE.
She sees the
rooftop of one of the building modules lit by tracer fire.
BREWSTER's
tethered nearby, BARKING furiously.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
The wind whips at GUTTIEREZ as he blinks away his shock.
GUTTIEREZ
Holy shit...
DE VRIES keeps her torch beam on the moving shape.
It halts by the
edge of the roof, and stares at them.
DE VRIES
Oh, nice going, man!
It was a lemur! A goddamn lemur!
GUTTIEREZ' radio headset CRACKLES to life.
HIROKO
(O.S., on headset)
Guttierez, what the hell's going on up there?
GUTTIEREZ
Uh... sorry about that, boss.
Everything's fine.
False alarm, that's
all.
DE VRIES glances around the rooftop, annoyed.
DE VRIES
Hey, look; let's forget it.
There's nothing up here.
PREDATOR-VISION.
DE VRIES in CLOSE-UP, glowing brightly.
Her VOICE replayed and
distorted.
PREDATOR
(O.S.)
Nothing up here.
Nothing up here.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES hear the gunfire from below.
GUTTIEREZ
The hell was that?
PREDATOR-VISION.
The PREDATOR's gaze SNAPS away from the two humans and down onto the
platform below.
He watches the infra-red shapes of other people
running towards the source of the shots...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
In a HAND-HELD SHOT we're running with HIROKO's group along the narrow
catwalk bridging the roadway to the Pump Room, KAMEN taking the lead.
DILLER sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides
with him.
KAMEN
Kev, wha...?
DILLER breaks free of the other man's grasp.
He looks as if he's about
to say something, but never gets the chance.
There's a sound of TEARING METAL, and a HISSING seven-foot express
train of teeth and biomechanical limbs ERUPTS from the shadows.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK
PREDATOR-VISION.
Gazing down at the platform, an unseen hunter watches the swift black
SHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the group of humans...
From the corner of her eye, DE VRIES sees something moving nearby.
She
violently pulls GUTTIEREZ out of the path of the shimmering FORM that
barges past them, launching itself from the rooftop.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
With superhuman strength, the ALIEN brutally back-hands DILLER,
splintering his skull and killing him instantly.
His body caromes into
THOMAS, knocking the man to the floor.
The ALIEN turns to KAMEN, it's
questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the
ground.
The space on the catwalk it limited; there's so many people
it's impossible to get a clean
shot...
HIROKO
Move!
Get out of the way!
HIROKO draws a bead on the ALIEN.
She flips off the safety on her
rifle. It's the tiniest CLICK, but the ALIEN somehow senses danger.
It's skeletal tail lashes out, sending both her and the weapon flying.
CALDWELL gets in for his shot, but the tail's there in a second.
It
strikes like a snake. Once.
Twice.
The stinger punctures CALDWELL's
chest and throat.
Nobody could survive something like that...
The ALIEN flicks it's skull back around to KAMEN.
The man's head is
inches away from it's eyeless face...a row of burnished metal teeth
open...the toothed inner tongue ready to strike...
WHOOMPH.
Something lands heavily close-up, jarring the catwalk.
The
ALIEN drops KAMEN and WHIRLS.
A spear wielded by an INVISIBLE FORM
appears out of nowhere and PIERCES the ALIEN's midriff, spraying acidic
fluid.
The creature emits a OUTRAGED SHRIEK and flails around, it's
ubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant.
The STINGER
makes contact:
there's a SPUTTERING SOUND as the PREDATOR's cloaking
device begins to flicker spasmodically, giving us peek-a-boo glimpses
of it's natural form.
Electrical sparks dance around the PREDATOR's
ruin wrist-computer, luminous green blood welling from a wound in his
arm...
From out of the Pump Room comes more NOISE, like metal being trashed in
a compactor.
HIROKO SCREAMS at KAMEN, who's COUGHING painfully next to
the door panel.
HIROKO
Get the door!
KAMEN hastily slaps the 'close' button and both halves of the exterior
pressure bulkhead RUMBLE together.
A SECOND ALIEN appears from the
shadows within and prises it's fingers into the dwindling gap,
struggling for purchase.
Despite the ALIEN's best efforts, the door
motors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid
CLUNK.
MUFFLED POUNDING comes from the other side.
Nearby, THOMAS has retrieved CALDWELL's weapon in the heat of the fight
and is bringing it to bear on the PREDATOR.
At the last possible
moment HIROKO sees what he's about to do...
HIROKO
No!
Reflexively, she knocks the barrel away as THOMAS looses a volley of
shots.
PREDATOR-VISION.
The PREDATOR's speech analyser plays back her vocal patterns as white-
hot bullets sear the night.
PREDATOR
No!
PREDATOR-VISION.
SNAPPING IN for a closer look at her.
PREDATOR (CONT'D)
No!
One of the ALIEN's hands clamps firmly onto the PREDATOR's mask and
wrenches it off.
HIROKO stares at the PREDATOR's face in fascination.
From the distinctive features, we see that it's BROKEN TUSK.
The
PREDATOR's good hand flashes down to his thigh, almost too quick to
follow.
In one rapid movement a circular 'smart-weapon' is brought up,
slicing the front of the ALIEN skull away from it's head.
In a feat of
strength, the PREDATOR lifts his opponent's corpse on the end of the
spear and hurls it over the catwalk railing...
Not wasting a second, BROKEN TUSK performs an almost-vertical bound of
some twenty feet with astounding grace.
He grips a pipe running down
the side of one of the building modules, then clambers over the roof's
edge and finally disappears from view.
BREWSTER continues to BARK
frenetically.
HIROKO's headset has been knocked to the floor and a FRANTIC MUTED
VOICE is coming from it.
She picks it up, and presses the 'transmit'
switch.
HIROKO
(into headset)
It's alright, Rob...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
THOMAS is moving from DILLER to CALDWELL, checking them for signs of
life. HIROKO catches his eye.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Well?
THOMAS shakes his head.
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES race across the
platform to join the stunned survivors of the skirmish.
GUTTIEREZ
bends down by DILLER's body.
THOMAS lays a hand on GUTTIEREZ' arm.
THOMAS
Come on, man.
Leave it alone.
GUTTIEREZ
Oh, God.
Dear Lord Jesus...
DE VRIES
This is like a bad dream, man.
A bad fucking dream.
HIROKO thinks quickly, and comes to a decision.
She speaks into her
radio headset.
HIROKO
Rob?
I want you to evac everybody from the non-connective modules into
admin. That goes double for anybody...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
HIROKO turns her headset off and watches numerous rotating coloured
lights dotted around the platform start to blink on-and-off.
KAMEN
COUGHS a few more times.
HIROKO
Are you okay?
KAMEN rubs his throat.
He nods.
KAMEN
I'll survive.
BREWSTER's BARKS cease, replaced instead with a TERRIFIED LOW WHINING.
DE VRIES
What's with the dog?
GUTTIEREZ jogs over to BREWSTER.
Lowers his rifle to the ground and
fumbles with the knot tying the dog to the pipe.
GUTTIEREZ
Hey; c'mon now, girl.
It's alright.
Let's just get this knot
undone...
A spray of plastic shards EXPLODES not three feet away from GUTTIEREZ.
The rifle goes skittering away out of reach, and he scrambles away as
an ALIEN half-pulls itself out of the sewer overflow, wet and
glistening...
KAMEN
Jan!
BREWSTER's a mass of fur, totally out of control.
When the ALIEN
lashes out to grab the HOWLING animal, there's nothing GUTTIEREZ can
do.
BREWSTER's legs are the last thing we see, thrashing helplessly as
she's dragged down into the splinter-edged gap.
DE VRIES
Get out of there, man!
THOMAS grabs CALDWELL's rifle from the deck.
He races towards
GUTTIEREZ, with
DE VRIES close behind...
THOMAS
Catch this!
From behind comes the SOUND of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid
limbs struggle up out of newly-broken ducts.
THOMAS heaves the rifle
over the heads of the emerging ALIENS.
Although GUTTIEREZ snags it
awkwardly, he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures.
GUTTIEREZ
Chew on this!
DE VRIES races up to join them, SCREAMING as she fires.
KAMEN glances
down at this tracker's tiny screen.
It shows clusters of signals, lots
of them.
KAMEN
(hollering)
They're all around, they're in the drainage system!
DE VRIES reacts swiftly, loosing a round of shots at the emerging
ALIENS. GUTTIEREZ yells across to KAMEN.
GUTTIEREZ
Get your ass out of here, boss!
ALIENS are appearing everywhere.
From the overflow ducts; over the
platform edges; along overhead cable supports.
Having taken on the
genetic characteristics of their hosts, many of them are non-humanoid.
All of them are living nightmares.
HIROKO
Oh my God...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK
THOMAS, GUTTIEREZ, and DE VRIES are cut-off.
As they race swiftly down
the street, GUTTIEREZ tries hard to interpret his tracker's signals.
A
particularly loud BLEEP registers from a source immediately behind
them.
He glances over his shoulder and sees an ALIEN crawling down the
outside of a module towards them.
GUTTIEREZ
De Vries!
DE VRIES' head turns.
She sees the ALIEN and nails it with a rapid
burst. It falls onto the concrete nearby, writhing in it's death
throes.
The group round the corner of a building.
Across the street from them
is parked KAMEN's crawler.
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Inside, inside!
They scramble up into the cab.
GUTTIEREZ throws himself into the
driver's seat.
An ALIEN sprints at the crawler with bared teeth.
THOMAS looses a shot, blasting it backward into a Pepsi sign.
THOMAS
Yo' momma, boneface!
DE VRIES
(to Guttierez)
C'mon, man; punch this cow!
GUTTIEREZ fumbles at the ignition.
They keys are there.
He flips
them, and the engine GROWLS to life.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - DUSK
PREDATOR-VISION.
From way up here, we've got an outstanding view of the humans running
across the platform...
Crouching on a bright-yellow catwalk, BROKEN TUSK presses closed a
panel on the small container balanced on his knee.
Inside it are rows
of metal instruments with a pristine surgical quality about them.
BROKEN TUSK flexes his hand experimentally.
Satisfied, he clips the
medical kit onto his back before getting to his feet.
Standing around him are several other PREDATORS.
All but one have
their camouflage cloaks activated.
The SOUND of GUNFIRE way across the
station draws their attention...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
HIROKO and KAMEN bolt towards an external hatch, with KAMEN laying down
a field of covering fire on full-automatic.
The blaze of light from
the rifle's barrel abruptly stops.
HIROKO
What?
KAMEN
I'm out of ammo.
Get inside, get inside!
HIROKO hears a HORRIBLE NOISE nearby.
A field of cows being
slaughtered by machetes would sound like this.
HIROKO
They're in with the rhino!
RYUSHI STATION - RHINO PEN - DUSK
An ALIEN is SMASHED sideways into the one solid wall of the pen,
broadsided and instantly crushed by a ton of FRENZIED rhino.
It's
yellow blood eats into the weighty quadruped, eliciting ANGUISHED
BELLOWS of pain from the hapless creature.
ALIEN stingers slice through the air.
Rhinos try to bolt but are
intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces.
It's wholesale carnage.
PREDATOR-VISION.
We're moving swiftly along the rooftops and surveying the melee below,
lessening the distance with each second...
Several indefinable FIGURES plunge into the fray, creating anarchy
within the ALIENS' ranks.
The biomechanoids HISS with fury as the
PREDATORS join battle against them...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
An ALIEN hurls itself through the air and onto the speeding crawler's
roof.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK
GUTTIEREZ' group hurriedly exits the crawler.
A cloud of acrid smoke
rapidly fills the cabin.
DE VRIES
(coughing)
Move it, man!
The dead ALIEN's corpse tumbles through the acid-eaten hole, falling
into the cab's rear seat and promptly burning through that as well. Not
far away across the platform, the massive doors to the auto-shop hanger
are RUMBLING slowly closed...
GUTTIEREZ
(shouting)
Hold the doors, hold the doors!
They don't hear him.
The doors seal with a BOOM of finality.
DE VRIES
Over there, on the right!
THOMAS sees the two ALIENS nimbly climbing the platform's edge.
He
squeezes off about five shots, managing to kill the FIRST ALIEN...
THOMAS
These bastards ain't so tough!
***************************
***** PAGE 70 MISSING *****
***************************
THOMAS looks concernedly at GUTTIEREZ.
THOMAS
Is that thing working?
GUTTIEREZ takes off the headset and scrutinises it closely.
GUTTIEREZ
Shit!
The casing's cracked!
DE VRIES rips her headset off and urgently passes it to him.
DE VRIES
Use mine.
Channel twenty-six.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
Despite their ferocity and weapons, it's clear that the small group of
PREDATORS are being overrun by the ALIEN horde.
BROKEN TUSK's shoulder cannon swivels automatically, blowing away
another attacker.
Hearing a distinctive SCREAM, he looks across the
platform.
One of the PREDATORS, it's camouflage cloak flickering
intermittently, is trying to resist being dragged down into a duct.
The two ALIENS in either side plunge their tail-stingers into the
PREDATOR's body, making it CRY OUT in agony.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK
The two ALIENS THOMAS killed must have been the scout party.
Others
appear, more cautiously this time...
DE VRIES
Hurry up and figure that thing out, man!
GUTTIEREZ is desperately trying to operate the tiny plastic
microswitches on the headset with his fingernails.
GUTTIEREZ
What?
THOMAS
We've got company!
THOMAS brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger.
He gets off
one shot, then nothing more happens.
He looks at the counter on the
side.
It reads 'zero'.
THOMAS (CONT'D)
Shit, I'm dry!
You're up!
DE VRIES raises her rifle.
She aims, and...
CLICK.
DE VRIES
I'm jammed!
THOMAS
You're what?!
She works the manual slide.
DE VRIES
It's locked solid...
THOMAS
Quick, give me the clip!
DE VRIES fumbles the ammunition clip from her rifle.
It falls from her
hands onto a plastic overflow grate.
THOMAS leaps after it...about a
second too late.
It slips through the narrow gap, gone for good.
THOMAS (CONT'D)
Oh, Lord!
Please, no!
Not now!
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK
Back outside, the ALIENS have sensed that something's amiss.
DE VRIES
turns desperately to GUTTIEREZ.
DE VRIES
You got any slugs left?
GUTTIEREZ looks down at the counter on his slung weapon.
GUTTIEREZ
Yeah.
Uh...
DE VRIES rips the weapon off his shoulder.
GUTTIEREZ completes his
sentence.
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
...Seven.
BLAM!
BLAM!
BLAM!
DE VRIES tries to make each shot count.
She
sights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical
storage containers. Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires...
A molten ball EXPLODES outward, transforming the immediate vicinity
into a blazing inferno.
The ALIEN's body twists end-over-end,
remaining immobile as it hits the deck.
A curtain of fire ripples
across the platform...
THOMAS
Yes!
Their victory is short-lived.
The other ALIENS crawl cautiously
forward, flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed.
We can
clearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws.
DE VRIES
Try again, man...
The headset in GUTTIEREZ' hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct
channel. He YELLS into it...
GUTTIEREZ
Matt!
Open these damn doors right now, I'll ream your ass so bad these
things out here'll seem like the Easter Bunny in comparison!
Swear to
God!
THOMAS turns and hammers on the impenetrable plate metal.
THOMAS
Open the doors!
Open the goddamned fucking doors!
BLAM!
BLAM!
BLAM!
CLICK.
GUTTIEREZ' bullets are gone.
DE VRIES
That's it!
We're dead!
The first of the ALIENS rushes at them.
This is the end.
DE VRIES
SCREAMS...
There's a blinding flash, and most of the ALIEN's head vaporises.
GUTTIEREZ blinks is disbelief as hazy SHAPES comprised of refracted
fire suddenly occupy the killing ground between the HUMAN and ALIEN
antagonists.
Intense bursts of light illuminate the platform as hi-
tech PREDATOR weaponry far in advance of the humans' sears the air...
GUTTIEREZ turns at the SOUND of the huge metal doors GRINDING slowly
open. Just enough for them to get through.
GUTTIEREZ
Move!
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK
The battle outside is going badly for the PREDATORS.
There's only
three of them left, and one is BROKEN TUSK.
A projectile WHISTLES through the air towards an ALIEN, expanding in
flight into a wire capture net.
Barbed tips on each corner bite into
the wall of a base module, trapping the enraged creature.
Small motors
WHINE as the thin metal pulls inward, slicing into the ALIEN's body...
The PREDATOR savors the scene for just a second...which is a second too
long. ALIENS are all over him, clawing and ripping at his body.
The
shoulder-mounted plasma-cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and
CLATTERS to the floor.
The PREDATOR goes down, groping for the self-destruct system on his
wrist. He manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar, but
gets no further.
An ALIEN pounces at him, it's tail descending.
The
PREDATOR raises his arm in reflex, but the stinger SMASHES straight
through the buries it in his face-plate, taking out the wrist-computer
in the process.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOPS - DUSK
BROKEN TUSK and the other PREDATOR scramble up onto the rooftop in a
bid to escape their unstoppable opponents.
Back-to-back, they take up
fighting positions.
A few seconds later, the first of the ALIENS
arrives.
Both the PREDATORS' shoulder cannons blaze, firing volley-after-volley.
Still the ALIENS keep on coming, finally reaching the point where it's
hand-to-hand...and nothing else.
It's a vicious, fast, and bloody on both sides.
BROKEN TUSK takes
flight; his companion is not as lucky.
The other PREDATOR kicks an
ALIEN from him and over the roof's edge.
The ALIEN lashes out with
lightning-fast reflexes, pulling the PREDATOR with it.
Both creatures
hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of
the modules.
Caught like flies in a spider's web.
Both thrash about,
severing cables as they do.
Electrical sparks CRACKLE through the
air...
RYUSHI STATION - ANTENNA ARRAY - NIGHT
The station's massive antenna array is being transformed.
Otherworldly
shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to
cover it's surface.
ALIENS drop from dizzying heights, exuding streams
of gelatinous gunk from the four 'exhaust' pipes on their backs.
They're building a nest of staggering proportions.
Unnoticed by the busy biomechanoids, faint sparks flicker from the
crane catwalk high above...
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT
BROKEN TUSK sits on the catwalk floor, a small shower of sparks
lighting his face.
He's attempting to repair his broken wrist computer
with an intricate tool.
He removes it and presses a switch.
The
display glows briefly, then fades.
He inserts it again.
Electrical
sparks CRACKLE across the computer's fascia, before burning out.
BROKEN TUSK throws the ruined machine away in disgust.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
BROKEN TUSK tries to be as unobtrusive as possible as he picks through
the aftermath of the battle down by the now-empty rhino pen.
He finds
something. A PREDATOR face-mask, with a massive crack down one side.
He turns it carefully over in his hands.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
Internal pressure forces the metallic plug out like a champagne cork.
It hits the platform with a loud CLUNK.
HIROKO hauls herself from the
shaft, trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit.
She
throws the helmet to the ground, SHATTERING the visor.
Yanks
desperately at the suit's release clamps, kicking the ruined garment
off.
As promised, the yellow-and-black hoverbike is nearby.
HIROKO starts
towards it, then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the
ruined pressure-suit.
She drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through
the smoking pile of cloth.
Finds the flap, RIPS it open, and withdraws
the keys.
SLAP!
A glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole.
HIROKO
scrambles to her feet as the injured ALIEN pulls itself out.
She tears
across to the bike and rams the key into the ignition.
The turbines
ROAR to life, and it lifts smoothly into the air.
HIROKO pivots the
powerful machine around, avoiding the creature's questing grasp.
Losing it's balance, the ALIEN SMASHES into the deck.
HIROKO's guns the bike away, speeding along the platform.
The fire
over by the auto-shop rages out of control, a column of black-and-
orange smoke rising into the air.
A DARK FORM hurls itself at her from an overhead cable-support.
Yet
another ALIEN.
It lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the
hoverbike, gaining balance in an instant.
HIROKO twists on her controls, trying to dislodge the creature by see-
sawing the bike side-to-side.
The ALIEN's got a firm hold though,
crawling hand-over-hand towards her.
HIROKO releases her grip on both
throttles simultaneously.
Air-brakes cut in, and the bike SLAMS to a
halt.
The breath WHOOSHES out of HIROKO as her chest impacts with the
surrounding roll-bar. The ALIEN is even less fortunate; momentum hurls
it back onto the concrete. HIROKO guns the engine again, and the
leading-edge of the manta-shaped machine's aerofoil catches the rising
creature, neatly decapitating it.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT
The hoverbike GROWLS to a halt by the base of the crane.
HIROKO
dismounts and draws her pistol.
Takes in the sheer height of the
ladder she's going to have to scale.
Thumbs her headset.
HIROKO
Okay, I make it to the crane.
You...
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE LADDER - NIGHT
HIROKO's climbing the ladder.
She stops to catch her breath.
HIROKO
Yeah, well don't get too carried away; we're only halfway home.
Talk...
RHUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT
HIROKO reaches the top and sprints along the catwalk towards the
Control Cab. She narrowly misses something metallic near the base of
the handrail.
If she'd taken the time to stop and look, she would have
seen BROKEN TUSK's ruined wrist computer.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE - NIGHT
Smoothly maintained engineering comes to life.
The enormous yellow
crane starts to move on it's track-rails.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER MODULE
Complex mechanical assemblies attach the module to it's supporting
pier-platforms.
There are a number of LOUD BANGS, similar to car
engines misfiring.
Explosive bolts release the tethers.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT
HIROKO runs back across the catwalk.
She might have missed the
PREDATOR's damaged computer before, but she doesn't this time.
Her
foot comes down on it and she slips.
The gun goes flying from her
hand.
HIROKO watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalk's edge for
a moment...
HIROKO
No!
...Then goes over.
She drops to all fours and peers over the side.
Luckily it's only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge.
She
reaches out for it...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
The two crawlers TEAR OUT of the auto-shop's opening doors, headlights
blazing.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
KER-SMASM!
GUTTIEREZ' crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway
and through the platform safety barrier.
It balances precariously for
a second, until finally it's weight sends it plunging into the swamp in
a CACOPHONY of STRESSED METAL and CRUMBLING CONCRETE.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT
Holding the cracked mask to his face, BROKEN TUSK looks up at the
gigantic crane moving against the night sky.
PREDATOR VISION.
Although the helmet's nightsight is malfunctioning, it's still good
enough to register the 'hot' infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk.
The sound of the two crawlers hurtling across the platform gets BROKEN
TUSK's attention.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT
HIROKO gets a firm grasp on one of the railing rungs, anchoring
herself. Stretches for the pistol with renewed determination.
She
brushes the barrel. Not good enough.
Tries again.
Success!
Her
fingers curl around the weapon, and she tugs it upwards.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
The two crawlers plunge into the curtain of flames spreading across the
platform.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT
HIROKO leaps the last few rungs from the moving crane onto the
platform.
She dashes towards the hoverbike, some thirty feet away.
With no time to loose, she slides her boots into the foot-supports,
which automatically WHIRR closed.
Gropes for the ignition key...
Before she's even located it, the hoverbike moves.
SCRAPING across the
concrete.
ALIEN claws appear around the edge of one of the bike's
manta wings.
She's parked the bike over a drainage exit!
HIROKO SPINS the key and guns the engine.
The white-hot downblast from
the turbine exhaust SPLASHES across the SCREECHING ALIENS.
The vehicle
tilts and KICKS forward.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
The two crawlers emerge from the conflagration, scorched and trailing
fire. In the BACKGROUND, the crane-hoist centers over the admin module.
CATWALK P.O.V.,
looking straight down.
Four lasers scan quickly around the module's
edges.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
The sound of SHREDDING METAL makes HIROKO look down.
An ALIEN is
hanging on the underside of the bike!
She twists the throttle,
reducing acceleration and causing the vehicle to drop several inches.
Sparks shower the ground from where the creature makes contact with the
roadway.
The ALIEN's determination is astounding.
It's tail SLAMS up
through the alloy 'wing', anchoring it.
The biomechanoid starts to pulls itself up, shifting the bike's center
of gravity.
She fights the controls, but finds herself swerving.
One-
handed, she takes aim.
BLAM!
BLAM!
She misses the ALIEN, rupturing a
fuel pipe instead.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
The crane's clamping mechanism closes around the admin module, locking
into place.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
The crane hoists the module aloft, free of it's umbilicals.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
HIROKO's bike veers blindly around the corner of a building, with
HIROKO still SHOOTING.
She looks up and her eyes widen.
Ahead is the
out-of-control blaze.
A tongue of flame licks out across the platform,
directly in her path.
HIROKO slides the gun quickly into her shoulder-holster and ducks for
cover behind the bike's windshield.
The ALIEN's head twists around,
and they plunge into the inferno...
WHOOMPH!
The liquid from the breached pipe ignites, trailing a plume
of yellow flame.
HIROKO jams down on the foot-release and wrenches the
steering bar hard to the right.
She leaps for safety as the burning
bike with it's ALIEN passenger crashes through the station's safety-
rail and plummets into the swamp.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM RAMP - NIGHT
The two crawlers THUNDER down the ramp.
GUTTIEREZ' vehicle pulls into
a tight right turn, while MATT's continues on it's course.
The crane
with it's underslug module continues to RUMBLE slowly forward.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT
HIROKO mechanically tries to get up from the concrete roadway.
Winces.
Something hurts.
She looks down at the back of her left hand.
The
skin has been scraped away.
A DISTANT NOISE, something else being broken.
HIROKO turns.
Through
the conflagration, ALIENS are advancing.
RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
GUTTIEREZ' smoldering crawler pulls-up alongside Big Bertha's titanic
wheels.
RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES exit the crawler in a big hurry.
The moment
they're clear, the vehicle starts up and is gone.
DE VRIES is alert,
the tip of her rifle probing their surroundings.
DE VRIES
C'mon, man!
Let's shag it!
GUTTIEREZ begins climbing the tall ladder running up to the Bertha's
cab.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
HIROKO's running along the platform, pistol clenched firmly in hand.
She thumbs her headset.
HIROKO
Rob, it's Hiroko.
Come in.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
HIROKO spins around the corner, pointing her gun cop-stance.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.
Don't
wait for me.
The heli-jet pad's just up ahead.
The relief on HIROKO's face is
enormous.
HIROKO
No 'buts'.
Just do it.
Noguchi out.
RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - NIGHT
HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet.
The flicker of an
andrenalin-fueled smile plays on her face...the disappears.
Like a scorpion scuttling over a rock, the ALIEN climbs up on top of
the grounded machine.
It's head turn towards her.
HIROKO starts to
raise her pistol... then stops.
Other ALIENS are descending the nearby
navigation tower... straight for her.
HIROKO turns tail.
She races over to a ladder running up the side of a
building and begins to climb.
RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
The shadow of the crane and it's cargo falls over Big Bertha's rear
flatbed. Flashing warning strobes illuminate the twin hydraulic arms
which rise up to meet it.
SWAMP - NIGHT
ALIENS rise up out of the swamp below, and start to scale Bertha's
balloon tires.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT
HIROKO takes flight across the rooftops with the ALIENS in pursuit like
a pack of dogs.
She vaults extractor intakes and retrofitted junk with
ease. So do the ALIENS.
She cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the
main street, trying not to lose her footing.
Just before reaching the
other side, HIROKO slips and falls to her knees.
Her headset drops
thirty feet onto the concrete roadway.
Her hand rests on something
red.
It's the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to
the building.
She scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch.
Glances up.
The ALIENS are already starting across.
She pulls the
primer cylinder out by it's handle.
Jams it into the detonator, and
turns...
She's practically on top of the bolts.
The EXPLOSION is DEAFENING.
With the clamp on this side free, the conduit falls into the street
with a SCREECH of twisted metal.
One of the ALIENS is pulverized by
the falling debris, but the others survive.
All HIROKO's managed to do
is buy herself some breathing space...
She races across the building's roof.
Reaches the other
side...straight into a dead end.
RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
The admin module locks onto Bertha's manipulator arms with a satisfying
CLUNK.
Autocouplers slot into place, and the crane releases it's load.
SWAMP - NIGHT
Bertha's wheels GRIND to life, spilling ALIENS and crushing them under
it's treads...
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT
HIROKO's P.O.V.
It's a straight drop thirty feet onto concrete, with
no ladders or any other way down.
She looks desperately around for
another avenue of escape.
The leering face of an ALIEN comes up over the roof's edge.
HIROKO
swings her pistol over and fires.
It falls away...only to be replaced
seconds later by two others.
Her gun goes dry.
Quick as a flash, she ejects the spent magazine.
She slaps the spare in and continues firing.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT
BANG!
BANG!
BANG!
BANG!
CLICK.
HIROKO's gun's empty.
She reaches
for another clip on her bandolier...then realises that was her last
one.
The encircling ALIENS HISS triumphantly and close in.
With no place to
go, and no means of defending herself, HIROKO's a goner.
The lead
ALIEN's lethal double-barrel teeth open.
It's almost on her.
HIROKO
CRIES OUT...
WHOOSH!
The ALIEN's face is severed in half.
A circular metal object
blurs through the air and loops back on itself, almost faster then the
human eye can follow.
A massive form SLAMS down in front of HIROKO,
pushing her out of the way.
She hits the deck hard and gasps.
BROKEN
TUSK is standing before her.
He skillfully catches the frisbee-like
'smart weapon', then
throws it again.
HIROKO watches with awe as the PREDATOR joins battle against the
ALIENS. HISSING ALIEN jaws are silenced by BROKEN TUSK's formidable
fighting
technique.
Questing limbs are BLASTED and HACKED away by
advanced PREDATOR weaponry.
Acidic blood flows freely.
The skirmish
is surprisingly brief.
BROKEN TUSK and HIROKO stare at one another.
BROKEN TUSK pulls a slung
metal rod from his shoulder.
Two barbed tips SCHNICK outwards, forming
a spear. The PREDATOR looks at her, and his lip curls.
It takes a
second for HIROKO to realise he's offering it to her.
Bewildered, she
accepts it, pulling herself up.
A bright orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind, getting both of
their attentions.
BROKEN TUSK regards her.
His mandibles CLICK-CLACK
nervously...
HIROKO
Look.
Don't take this the wrong way, but when I imagined the cavalry
coming to my rescue... they never looked like you.
The PREDATOR turns away, seemingly uninterested.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
Another gout of flame BELCHES out of the churning mass in the middle of
the station.
RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT
HIROKO turns her recovered headset over in her hands.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Broken.
Useless!
She throws it aside.
BROKEN TUSK stands beside her, keeping guard.
Another DETONATION goes off behind, even LOUDER.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jesus.
I.C.C.'re gonna have to close the book on this place.
She SLAPS BROKEN TUSK on the arm.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Come on, Butch.
Let's go.
She begins to walk away.
BROKEN TUSK crosses to the safety barrier,
peering over the side...
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hey!
I said come on!
The PREDATOR turns a deaf ear to her.
He gauges the distance below,
then throws himself off the platform's edge.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
What...?
She races across to the rail and gazes downward.
HIROKO'S P.O.V.
The PREDATOR wades through the swamp towards something she cannot see.
HIROKO looks around the platform.
She's suddenly very alone.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Shit!
She crosses to a maintenance ladder and begins to descend.
RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - NIGHT
HIROKO SPLASHES through the swamp towards the PREDATOR.
BROKEN TUSK
has paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform
piers, running directly out into the swamp.
Most of the drain is
underwater, with only about eight inches protruding from the water.
The thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted.
Broken from
within.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
You've got to be joking.
No way am I going back in there!
No joke.
BROKEN TUSK starts submerging to get across inside.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hey!
BROKEN TUSK pauses for a moment.
He gives her a look, then disappears
into the blackness.
HIROKO looks around.
It's no fun being the last
person left alive here.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Goddammit!
She takes several deep breaths, then reluctantly follows...
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN
A VAST EXPLOSION rips through the base, broiling clouds of flame
rolling across the platform and seeping into the drainage ducts.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN
The metal plug HIROKO blew during her earlier escape still lies to one
side of the duct HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK crawl hastily out of.
Fireballs are erupting all around now, making their situation
precarious.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - PRE-DAWN
From a vantage point high above, we see HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK racing
across the platform towards the heli-jet pad.
RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN
BROKEN TUSK stumbles and falls.
HIROKO bends down to help him up, but
the PREDATOR shoves her away.
He doesn't want her assistance.
HIROKO
If you don't move your ugly butt, we're gonna end up barbecued!
Come
on!
RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet, with the PREDATOR close
behind. The landing pad is made up of an intricate series of grilles
designed to deflect downward exhaust gases.
HIROKO's feet CLATTER
across the metal...
KER-SMASH!
The metal is SMASHED from beneath, right in front of her.
The IMMATURE ALIEN QUEEN has made is out of the sewer system and has
got the jump on them.
HIROKO's forward momentum won't allow her to
stop running...she's too close.
Almost at the last moment, she jumps.
claws brush her trouser leg, but close on thin air.
She hits the deck
and quickly closes the last few feet to the chopper.
BROKEN TUSK stops.
ALIENS are appearing all over the pad and out of
nearby drainage ducts.
RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN
An orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind BROKEN TUSK.
With the
ALIENS blocking his path, there's no refuge for him. Almost.
The
Navigation Tower looms overhead, nearby.
BROKEN TUSK takes a
calculated risk and LEAPS for it.
RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN
The heli-jet rises, a little unsteadily.
The wash from the turbines
plays across the SHRIEKING ALIENS.
RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN
BROKEN TUSK scales the ladder as quickly as he can.
As the top of the
tower is a gallery catwalk surrounding the flashing beacon array.
The IMMATURE QUEEN, accompanied by a phalanx of warrior ALIENS, is
almost upon him.
The PREDATOR drives his wrist knives into the throat
of a grasping ALIEN, which falls downward, writhing.
It CRASHES into
the QUEEN, who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork.
She
HISSES, lashing out at the creature.
Sends it hurtling to the ground.
RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN
BROKEN TUSK makes it to the top.
There's not much space on the catwalk
to maneuver.
He looks around, then down.
This is his last stand.
Instinctively, he reaches down to his wrist for the self-destruct
computer. Of course, it's not there.
RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN
BROKEN TUSK SMASHES his foot hard into the face of an ALIEN.
A BLAST
of displaced air hits him like a sledgehammer.
He turns...
HIROKO's heli-jet hovers stationary just a few feet away from the
tower, the door on the co-pilot's side flapping open.
She HOLLERS at
the PREDATOR over the ROAR of the engines.
HIROKO
C'mon!
Jump!
BROKEN TUSK looks down.
It's a long drop...but it's the best option
available to him.
He jumps.
THWACK!
His hands grip the door frame.
The heli-jet wobbles slightly,
it's center of gravity shifting.
BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and
through the door as...
...KER-BLAM!
A massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the
storage tanks below ignite.
The shock wave buffets the chopper against
the tower.
RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN
CRUNCH!
The chopper hits, knocking several ALIENS from their
handholds.
One of the QUEEN's arms SHOOTS OUT, wrapping itself around
the port engine mount.
RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN
The QUEEN is hanging from the beleaguered craft, it's weight drawing it
slowly down.
In the BACKGROUND, the Navigation Tower begins to slowly
collapse.
RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO pilots the heli-jet over the station's storage tanks.
The
conflagration below has gotten completely out-of-hand.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
The QUEEN is starting to struggle up, it's arms flailing for purchase.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
A red dot of light runs across the QUEEN's head.
She must sense it
somehow. Her head comes round to bear...
BROKEN TUSK's got the pulse-rifle trained right on her.
BROKEN TUSK
Chew...on...this...!
BLAM!
A round open a nice, neat hole in the QUEEN's head.
She YOWLS.
BLAM! A second round does the job.
The QUEEN relinquishes her grip and
falls, SCREECHING all the way down into the raging inferno below.
RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN
The heli-jet accelerates hell-for-leather away.
An incandescent BALL
OF ENERGY expands outward, vaporising the station and most of the
surrounding bayou for about a mile's radius.
LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - PRE-DAWN
Big Bertha's parked by the blinking blue beacon tower, site of the ill-
fated hunting expedition.
About a dozen or so people are milling
around, smoking cigarettes or talking.
MATT and DE VRIES are leaning against the wheels of MATT's crawler.
They feel the concussive shock-wave, and look upward.
Their P.O.V.
Above the treetops, a blinding white-light BLURS OUT the horizon...
MATT
Holy shit!
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
A chunk of metal is propelled through the air and RIPS into the
chopper's starboard engine.
There's a BURST of flame, then the
extinguishers cut in.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
The chopper clips the tree boughs, and bounces.
SWAMP - PRE-DAWN
The heli-jet PLOUGHS into the swamp floor with a sickening CRUNCH,
spraying mud all around.
SWAMP - PRE-DAWN
The chopper comes to rest in the swamp.
The SQUAWKING of the local
WILDLIFE O.S. gradually dies down.
SWAMP - DAWN
The sun begins to rise as HIROKO exits the heli-jet and goes around to
the other side.
She manages to get the mangled door open.
BROKEN
TUSK's wound looks even worse up-close.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hold on.
This is gonna hurt some.
HIROKO gets her arm under BROKEN TUSK's shoulder.
The PREDATOR braces
himself, and starts to move.
The agony is excruciating; his mandibles
open and he lets out a LEONINE ROAR.
HIROKO helps him out of the seat.
The PREDATOR gets unsteadily to his
feet. What happens next is totally unexpected.
BROKEN TUSK's throat BURSTS, fountaining green blood.
Shocked, HIROKO
gets out of the path of the PREDATOR's tumbling mass.
She looks up.
The ALIEN stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts it's
sledgehammer tongue, it's head following her movements.
The PREDATOR's 'smart' weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying
blade-down in the mire.
HIROKO scoops up, activating it and scrambling
away.
She gets to her feet and holds the HUMMING disc before her.
The ALIEN climbs warily down from the heli-jet, and the two opponents
face each other like sumo wrestlers.
HIROKO assumes a defensive
stance, holding the disc ready to strike.
The ALIEN hisses, it's tail
stinger coming around. It leaps for her, and battle is joined.
The
ALIEN lashes out, but HIROKO counters by swinging the weapon time and
time again.
With each thrust, surgically thin wounds open up on the
biomechanoid's body.
One of the ALIEN's attacks sends her reeling to
the floor, it's stinger arching towards her.
She parries, slicing the
tail in half and struggling to her feet.
The ALIEN strikes again.
HIROKO feints, then thrusts, lopping off one
of it's hands.
The ALIEN HOWLS with pain, blinding lashing out at her
and sending the 'smart' weapon flying from her grip.
She's lost, and the creature knows it.
It's lips curl into a SNARL.
KER-POW!
KER-POW!
The ALIEN's head DETONATES, and it's skeletal body
slumps forward to SPLASH into the swamp...revealing BROKEN TUSK
pointing the pulse
rifle.
The dying PREDATOR GURGLES, his head drooping.
HIROKO stumbles across
to him.
BROKEN TUSK's in a bad way, green gore is pulsing freely from
it's throat.
It gazes up at HIROKO.
BROKEN TUSK
Not...a pretty...sight...
And with that, the PREDATOR dies.
HIROKO look around.
The sun is rising above the treetops, and the
setting is serene.
Somehow beautiful.
The speakers in the heli-jet cabin CRACKLE to life, jarring her.
VOICE
(O.S., on speakers)
Rimward Tracking Station, this is the one thirty-second Rim Corp
Battalion operating out of the cruiser Tartarus from Fort Powell.
Please respond.
Over.
There's a sound O.S., like a THUNDERCLAP.
HIROKO surveys the horizon.
HIROKO's P.O.V.
A pair of MARINE DROPSHIPS float above the distant rainforest, their
weapons arms unfurled like exotic armed insects. Searchlights probe the
ground far below.
A shadow falls over HIROKO, blocking out the sun.
A monstrous SHAPE
occupies the air above, delineated only by a telltale vibration.
The
PREDATOR shuttlecraft lowers it's cloaking device, extending landing
gear and a ramp. It touches down in the bayou with scarcely a whisper.
HIROKO watches the PREDATORS file slowly out.
BROKEN TUSK's body is
borne aloft and carried back inside.
The LEAD PREDATOR turns to
HIROKO.
He crosses to her.
HIROKO's face is reflected in the faceted
eyepieces of the PREDATOR's helmet.
The extraterrestrial hunter pulls out his telescopic spear.
KER-CHUNK!
The tips lock into place.
The PREDATOR offers it to HIROKO.
She
accepts, a little confused.
There's a long moment.
The PREDATOR is still standing there.
Waiting.
HIROKO's eyes narrow.
Her mind is working furiously.
What do they
want?
She realises.
It suddenly becomes clear.
She smiles.
HIROKO
Yeah.
Why not.
HIROKO glances back at the hovering DROPSHIPS, then walks around the
waiting PREDATOR and into the shuttlecraft without looking back.
The PREDATOR follows her.
The ramp SLAMS closed, as we...
