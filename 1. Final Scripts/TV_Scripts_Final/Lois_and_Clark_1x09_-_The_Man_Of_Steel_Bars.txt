	FADE IN:


1	DAILY PLANET - (DAY #1)	1

	An incredibly hot day in Metropolis.  Most everyone
	dresses in shorts.  Traffic is snarled as a car gasps, its
	hood up, steam billowing from a ruptured radiator.  A
	couple of kids literally try to fry an egg on the
	sidewalk.  A near-naked vendor hawks sno-cones.  But
	something's very wrong with this picture.

	The sounds of CHRISTMAS MUSIC lead us to a charity Santa
	Claus, sweltering in his heavy garb, ringing a bell for
	donations.  A sign in the nearby shop reminds: "Only 20
	More Shopping Days Until Christmas."

	PICK UP LOIS and CLARK exiting the swinging doors onto the
	street.  As they hit the outside air, Lois reacts.

				LOIS
		A hundred and five degrees in
		December!

				CLARK
		That was yesterday.  Today I heard
		one hundred six.

				LOIS
		I can't work like this. I can't
		think like this.
			(yells O.S.)
		Taxi!

	A CAB DRIVER stands outside his car, smoke billowing from
	his engine.  He's holding up traffic for blocks. She and
	Clark take  off on foot.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		We're walking, come on.

	She walks across the street, passing the overheated cab.
	Clark follows and, as he passes, he surreptitiously blows
	a puff of SUPER COLD BREATH onto the steaming radiator.
	Clark taps the frustrated cabbie on the shoulder.

				CLARK
		Maybe you should try her again.

	The cabbie looks under the hood.

				CABBIE
		Hey, waddya know...

	Clark jogs to catch up to Lois.

				LOIS
		This press conference better be air
		conditioned.

	She looks around, realizing she's talking to herself.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		Clark?

	He jog up.  Lois takes a look at him.  His tie is cinched
	up, his jacket is on, but he looks cool as a cucumber.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		What planet are you from?  You're
		running and you don't even sweat.

				CLARK
		Bio-rhythmic control.

				LOIS
		Mind over heat prostration?

				CLARK
		Something like that.

				LOIS
		Well, let's hope somebody has some
		answers about this heat wave before
		your brain boils.

	Lois notices a collection of obviously overheated kids,
	sitting on the sidewalk curb.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		Poor kids.

	As they pass by a fire hydrant, Clark holds back
	momentarily, reaches down and POPS OFF A PLUG, releasing
	a small gush of cool water.  The kids' faces light up as
	they rush to play in it.  Clark falls back in step with
	Lois without missing a beat.  Lois notices the water and
	the kids, shakes her head, keeps walking.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		I've never been a summer person.
		Especially in the winter.

2	INT. CITY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY	2

	A full-house of Media, print and broadcast, sit in folding
	chairs.  Lois looks like she just took a swim with her
	clothes on while Clark still looks fresh.  On a dais in
	front, backed by a large projection screen, sits Mayor
	FRANK BERKOWITZ, physicist DR. EDWARD SAYER and LEX
	LUTHOR.  Everyone fans themselves as reporters yell
	questions at random.

				REPORTERS
		When will it cool down?  What's
		causing the heat?  What do you
		know?  What aren't you telling us?
		etc.

	The mayor begs for order.

				MAYOR BERKOWITZ
		Please, ladies and gentlemen, I
		know we're all a bit uncomfortable
		but let's try to stay calm.  The
		last thing we need right now is
		panic.  One at a time.  Mr. McKee,
		from Channel Six.

	MIKE MCKEE, an outrageous tabloid-style journalist who
	makes Geraldo look tame, rises.

				MCKEE
		Is it true that if the temperature
		reaches 115 and everyone keeps
		driving their cars that we'll all
		die a slow, suffocating death from
		carbon monoxide poisoning?

	The place goes up for grabs.

				MAYOR BERKOWITZ
		Of course not!  Don't be
		ridiculous.  The citizens of
		Metropolis are perfectly safe.
		It's just hot out.

				MCKEE
		And getting hotter by the hour.
		Follow up?

				MAYOR BERKOWITZ
		No!  Next!  Miss Lane, Daily
		Planet.

	Lois stands.

				LOIS
		Mister Mayor, between the brownouts
		and the blackouts, there doesn't
		seem to be enough electricity to
		power the air conditioners, let
		alone the traffic lights.  What's
		the city doing about it?

				MAYOR BERKOWITZ
		There's absolutely no need to worry
		about the power supply, it is
		completely under...

	Just then the lights go off.  More pandemonium as they
	come back on, but still flicker.  Luthor steps up to the
	podium.

				LUTHOR
		Ladies and Gentlemen, if I may...

	The reporters quiet down.

				LUTHOR
			(continuing)
		The Mayor has asked me here today
		to assure you all that my LexCorps
		Power Plant is one hundred percent
		ready to go on-line.

	Clark stands now, challenging Luthor.

				CLARK
		Isn't that the nuclear facility
		that's still pending approval from
		the utility commission?

				LUTHOR
		Approval that's being granted as we
		speak.

				CLARK
		Weren't there concerns over the
		environmental impact statement?

				LUTHOR
		That statement has been
		re-evaluated by a panel of top
		scientists, Mr. Kent.
			(magnanimously)
		Metropolis need power.  I have it
		to give.  The plant will be
		operational as soon as humanly
		possible.

	The crowd responds positively as the lights flicker again.
	Lois rises again, as does McKee.

	They both start talking at the game time,, but Lois wins by
	simply refusing to yield.

				LOIS
		Another source of energy is helpful
		but it's not going to solve the
		problem.  Where's the heat coming
		from?

	The mayor turns to Dr. Sayer who continuously wipes his 
	brow with a handkerchief as he speaks.

				DR. SAYER
		We've been studying all
		meteorological phenomena in the
		area, the jet stream, the ozone
		layer, even sun spots, but all
		patterns have been consistently
		normal over a specific control
		period.

				LOIS
		Are you saying there's no
		explanation?

				DR. SAYER
		There are no firm answers...

				LOIS
			(agitated)
		But why only Metropolis It's
		twelve degrees in New York, there's
		eight inches of snow in Chicago and
		we're having a run on sunblock.

				DR. SAYER
		We're trying everything we can.
		There is a theory but...

	He trails off.  Lois is like a dog with a bone.

				LOIS
		But what?

				DR. SAYER
		Well, it hasn't exactly been
		proved.


		We have a right to know what's
		causing this extreme condition.

				DR. SAYER
		Not what, who.

				DR. SAYER
		Yes, I do.

				LOIS
		Dr. Sayer, on behalf of the
		citizens of Metropolis, I demand to
		know who's causing the heat.

				DR. SAYER
		Superman.

	The room goes up for grabs.  Lois is stunned, but not as
	much as Clark

	Lois fumes as science reporter EDUARDO FRIEZ studies

	Each pair contains one with more reds and oranges than its
	mate.  Clark sits, lost in thought.  JIMMY, wearing a tank
	top, loads a camera.

		Superman affecting our weather.
		Huh.  It's intriguing, I'll say
		that.

				JIMMY
		Mystery novels are intriguing.
		This is libel!

				LOIS

		Slander.

	CAT enters, wearing a bikini, leaving little to the
	imagination.  Jimmy looks up.  Friez forgets his photos.
	Every man in the newsroom (except Clark) tracks her
	intently as she moves to her desk.

		The gossip business has heat stroke.

				FRIEZ
			(handing Perry photos)
		These are weather maps of Greater
		Metropolis taken on successive 
		days.  Cool followed by hot.  Each
		of the hot days correlates to some
		super effort by Superman.

				LOIS
			(indignant)
		Coincidence!

				FRIEZ
		Maybe.  But most physicists do
		think Superman's power is solar
		induced.

				JIMMY
		So, lots of things are solar
		powered.  Why blame Superman?

	Clark answers, almost to himself.

				CLARK
		No one knows how strong his powers
		are or how much energy it takes to
		re-charge him.  Superman could be
		drawing the sun's rays down to
		Metropolis like a giant heat funnel
		and not even know it.

				PERRY
		But, Superman's been here for
		months.  I don't see any reason
		for Metropolis to start cookin' now.

				JIMMY
		Yeah, but we had a really hot
		summer.  Now it's winter, and it's
		still hot.

				LOIS
		Whose side are you on?

				CAT
		You have to admit, Lois, it could
		be possible.

		But what if he doesn't?  And if
		he's endangering the lives of
		everyone in Metropolis, shouldn't
		you be issuing a shoot-to-kill

		I hope we won't be forced to use

		This is lunacy.  We have to do

		The people are worried about me

	A BAILIFF, leading a shackled PRISONER, turns to catch a
	glimpse of Superman.  In a split second, the prisoner
	grabs the bailiff's gun and holds him hostage.  Somebody
	SCREAMS and everybody looks.

		Everybody back!

	The crowd begins to back up.  Another bailiff begins to go
	for his gun.  Before he can even upholster it:

		Don't even try it.

	It's a tense stand-off.  Superman looks around.  He
	clearly is the last, best hope to avoid a tragedy.  He
	aims his HEAT VISION at the weapon.  It becomes so hot
	that the defendant tosses it to the ground.  In an
	instant, Superman uses SUPER-SPEED to close the gap.  He
	pries the defendant loose, lifts him off the ground and
	delivers him to the second bailiff.

	The crowd breaks into spontaneous APPLAUSE.  Judge Diggs

	Superman stands before Sergeant STAHL.  On either side of

	As officer Gibson adjusts his glasses and peers at the

	all the cops of the booking area crowded around the Man of
	Steel Bars.


15	BACK TO SCENE	15

	As the group photo breaks up, back into reality.  Superman
	shakes hands with the cops like he's the guest of honor at
	a fraternity party.  He turns to Sgt. Stahl:

				SUPERMAN
		May I make a phone call?

				SGT. STAHL

		You've got one coming.

	Stahl points to a pay phone (Lex-Tel) on the wall.

	Officers Gibson and Keaton lead Superman down a corridor
	of facing cells.  The occupants stare and SHOUT as he
	passes.  They stop at one cell, open the door and Superman
	steps in.  The door CLANGS shut.

	Superman sizes up his surroundings as his cellmates size
	him up.  Nearly half a dozen men, large and mean, stripped
	to the waist because of the heat, including the prisoner
	Superman disarmed in the courtroom.

				PRISONER

	Cheng jumps up, inadvertently knocking her coffee cup in

	City Attorney Cheng looks over at him.

	An excited Jimmy leads Lois into the room.

				LOIS
		Air conditioning!  No wonder you
		spent the night here.

				JIMMY
		Well, it paid off.  I think I found
		something.  Actually, the computer
		found something.  I confirmed it
		with our distinguished science
		editor.

	Jimmy sits at one of the consoles.

				LOIS
			(impatiently)
		What?

				JIMMY
			(proudly)
		Polonium.

				LOIS
		What?

				JIMMY
		Pol... here.

	Jimmy loads on the screen a spider-webby geothermal map.

				JIMMY
			(continuing)
		Remember this?

				LOIS
		Yes.  Heat distribution around
		Metropolis.

				JIMMY
		Right.  Now...

	He looks another map on top: an exact match.  Lois leans
	in closer, reads aloud.

				LOIS
		'Metropolis Geological Survey...
		subterranean... bismuth.'

	She looks the question at Jimmy.

				JIMMY
		The naturally occurring element
		bismuth is distributed beneath
		Metropolis in the exact same
		pattern as the heat, concentration.

46	CONTINUED:	46

				LOIS
		Bismuth is causing the heat?

				JIMMY
		No, polonium.  Bismuth is
		relatively inert.  It wouldn't
		cause heat.  Unless it was
		exposed to radiation.  Then it
		could change to the radioactive
		element polonium.  That would
		cause heat.

				LOIS
		So you're saying radiation is
		turning this bismuth into polonium
		and that's what's heating us up?

				JIMMY
		That's the theory.

				LOIS
		Is the radiation coring from
		Superman?

				JIMMY
		Not likely.  He hasn't tested
		radioactive in the past.

				LOIS
		Are we all in danger of radiation
		poisoning?

				JIMMY
		Not necessarily.  You could get a
		lot of heat out of polonium before
		you'd get to threatening levels.

				LOIS

		That red spot, is that where it's
		the hottest?

				JIMMY
		Yeah.

				LOIS
		What's above it?

	Jimmy enlarges the red spot, then presses another button.
	The street map of Metropolis flashes on.  There it is, in
	bold letters:  LEXCORPS NUCLEAR PLANT.

				LOIS
			(continuing)
		But that plant isn't operational
		yet.

		Could be a slow leak out of the
		reactor core.

				LOIS
		They're due to go on-line this
		afternoon.  What happens when they
		throw the switch?

				JIMMY
		It could send a surge of neutrons
		straight into the ground and then
		it won't matter how hot it is
		anymore.

				LOIS
		We've got to find Superman.

	Lois bursts forth from the building onto the street.
	She's lost, looking around, trying to make something
	happen.  She sees McKee, the TV reporter, doing a stand-up
	in front of his camera crew.

				MCKEE
		Superman is taking a super hike and
		not soon enough as far as this
		reporter's concerned.  Not only is
		he responsible for baking
		Metropolis, but rumor has it that
		his force field is the real reason
		the Metropolitans lost the pennant
		this year.

	The gears are turning in Lois's mind.  A plan is hatching.
	She moves in front of the camera.

		Hey, we're 'live' here.

				LOIS
			(to cameraman)
		Keep rolling!
			(grabbing microphone)
		Superman, if you can hear this,
		come back!  Or if any of you out
		there know where Superman is, get
		him this message.  We've figured
		this out.  It's not you.  You're

		Stop!

				LUTHOR
		I'm afraid stopping is not one of
		the options, Superman.

				LOIS
		We think there's a leak in the
		reactor core.  That's what's been
		causing the heat, not Superman.

				LUTHOR
		Dr. Sayer has given me his
		assurance there is no leak.

				LOIS
		There has to be.  The only other
		possibility is that somebody was
		causing a chemical reaction to heat
		Metropolis up on purpose.

				SUPERMAN
		You know anything about that,
		Luthor?

				LUTHOR
		It's unthinkable.  Therefore, we
		must stop this leak you're talking
		about.

	A technician approaches Luthor, whispers in his ear.

		We're on-line.  The fuel rods are
