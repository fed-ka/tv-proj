One A.M. on a hellish summer night in Spanish Harlem.

The ENGINE SCREAMS and HONKS through the city.

FLAMES ROAR from the upper stories of this slumlord's
shitbox. An engine and ladder company are on-scene
attacking the fire with hoses. Neighbors gawk. Gordy's
engine company arrives. Gordy hits the ground, moves to
a battalion chief. The chief's terse orders are drowned
out by the NOISE of the EQUIPMENT, fire and men. Gordy
moves back to his company, who have already hooked the
engine up to water.
GORDY
Top story's fully involved. We're
supporting inside. Two lines up
the stairs.
He points to Junior and then to the channel surfer, MIKE
SHEA, a veteran firefighter of Irish descent.
GORDY
Junior and Mike --
He points to the chess player, SAL DIBIASE, another FD
veteran, Mediterranean descent, and then to the rookie,
RONNIE BOOK, a New York melting pot mutt.
GORDY
-- Sal and Ronnie.
The chauffeur, ART WESTPHAL, German-Irish, stays with the
engine as Gordy grabs a fire axe and leads his two two-
man hose teams into...

Gordy carries the family's small child outside. He
passes the child to its grateful parents, while...
The rescued Firefighter sits on a curb looking at a hero
and shaking his head in disbelief and admiration.
17
20
It appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the
chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering
as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League
plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League.
Gordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his
lungs.
The rivalry's intense. The game close.
The noise
deafening. Bets are going down.
NYFD goes up by one in the final minute.
Gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team.
LUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented
fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an
unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And
misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts
toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting,
devastated at missing the easy "two." Gordy yells at him
to defend.
GORDY
Luis, get back! Pick up your man!
(CONTINUED)
9.
20
CONTINUED:
20
Luis shakes it off. Hustles back on "D" as his man gets
the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And
Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The
BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins.
21
SAME SCENE - GORDY AND LUIS - MOMENTS LATER
21
In the game's immediate aftermath. NYFD celebrating
around them. Gordy's proud of Luis.
GORDY
We lose, win, whatever. But one
thing we never do. We never, ever
give up. Right?
OFF Gordy, smiling at Luis...
22
SAME SCENE - LATER
22
The crowds are gone. Gordy checks his watch and starts
off, when a SOUND draws his attention.
23
GORDY'S POV
23
Luis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence
around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew
match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the
fence, clearly trying to intimidate him.
24
BACK TO SCENE
24
Gordy stalks walking toward them.
Calls --
GORDY
Luis...
Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off.
Reaching Luis --
GORDY
What was that about?
LUIS
Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em
anymore.
But Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the
gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to
go.
10.
25
25
THROUGH the window, we see Gordy delivering Luis to a
Latin man, clearly Luis's father and the bodega's owner.
We don't hear the words, but we can tell Gordy's
complimenting the boy to his dad.
Gordy emerges.
Checks his watch.
Whistles up a taxi.
26
27
Anne waits on the corner with Matt, playing with his
spaceship. She checks her watch. It's five of twelve.
28
29
Gordy exits the cab and takes off running.
30
ANNE
30
checks her watch again.
She's pissed now.
In b.g., a cop leaves his police cart to write a ticket.
A caravan of Lincoln Navigators passes Anne and turns
east on 68th.
31
GORDY
31
turns onto 68th. As he runs, he jumps, trying to see
Anne and Matt over other pedestrians.
11.
32
ANNE
32
In b.g., the Navigators pull up at a building flying the
Colombian flag. Latin and American men in suits get out
of the Navigators.
33
33
Gordy dodges pedestrians.
Still trying to get a glimpse
of Anne and Matt.
The cop we saw writing tickets earlier is walking the
other way. Gordy nearly collides with him. At the last
moment, the traffic cop shuffles Gordy aside.
GORDY
Sorry.
Gordy reaches the corner. Sees Anne and Matt. Whistles.
In b.g., behind Gordy, we see the cop get into a brown
Ford.
34
ANNE AND MATT
34
hear the WHISTLE.
Matt sees Gordy.
MATT
There he is.
Matt waves.
35
GORDY
35
waves back, shrugs an apology to Anne as he starts across
the street, when...
36
INTENSE FLASH
36
suddenly lights up the intersection.
In SLOW MOTION:
37
SHOCK WAVE
37
wave rolls up 68th past Madison...
38
HUGE BALL OF FLAME
38
erupts behind Anne and Matt...
We hear the ENORMOUS BANG of the explosion...
12.
39
WINDOWS
39
are sucked into millions of fragments, a hailstorm of
glass...
40
GREAT CHUNK OF METAL
40
-- an engine block -- flies from the ball of flame...
41
ANNE
41
instinctively pulls her child to her...
42
GORDY
42
sees the engine block tumbling through the air toward his
wife and son.
His scream is lost in the thunderous ROAR all around.
43
GORDY'S POV - IN SLOW MOTION
43
The engine block is about to hit Anne and Matt, when...
A FedEx TRUCK, WINDOWS SHATTERED, SKIDS past, wiping out
Gordy's line of sight. When the truck clears...
Anne and Matt are gone. The corner's empty.
Just Matt's
spaceship, slowly falling to the ground...
44
BACK TO SCENE
44
There's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to
avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air,
tumbling, then smacks to the ground.
Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris.
Then struggles to his hands and knees.
GORDY
Anne!
He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a
large shard of glass embedded in his leg.
People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about
finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but
can't see them, when...
His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Gordy screams out his agony --
GORDY
Noooooo!!!
45
45
The blast detonated here. Some men from the Navigators
are dead. MIKE BRANDT is not. Rises from the
devastation, gun in hand, as SIRENS wail in the distance.
46
46
Emergency personnel - EMS, NYPD, NYFD -- swarm the area.
Two white plastic sheets cover two bodies.
Across the street, PARAMEDICS work on Gordy's leg.
PARAMEDIC #1
We're gonna give you a shot.
Gordy's oblivious to the pain.
Shoves him away.
GORDY
I need to see them!
PARAMEDIC #1
We gotta help you right now.
PARAMEDIC #2
We've done all we can for 'em,
Gordy.

ANOTHER ANGLE
47
FBI agent JOE PHIPPS ducks under the police tape.
REGGIE
DRAY, a young agent, meets him. As they walk --
DRAY
Device functioned in front of the
Colombian Consulate just as a
motorcade full of brass arrived.
PHIPPS
Who were the brass, and why were
they here?
(CONTINUED)
14.
47
CONTINUED:
47
DRAY
No one's talking yet, but it
smells high-level. There were
Colombians and Americans in the
cars. Three of 'em ate it. Guy
on the phone --
He indicates Brandt, talking on a cell phone.
DRAY
-- is one of the survivors.
Name's Brandt. C.I.A.
That gets Phipps' interest momentarily. Then, as they
continue toward the consulate, he notices security
cameras on the building.
PHIPPS
Check the surveillance cameras?
DRAY
We're pulling up the video now.
PHIPPS
(stops; looks around)
Where's N.Y.P.D. on this?
DRAY
They know it's ours. They're
helping with shoe-leather.
Phipps' eyes go to the white sheets up the street.
DRAY
We got two dead bystanders, a
mother and four-year-old son. The
father's over there with a leg
wound.
(indicates Gordy)
Guy's a lieutenant with the New
York F.D.
PHIPPS
Anybody talk to him yet?
DRAY
We've been giving him room.
48
BACK TO GORDY

In b.g., Mike, the veteran firefighter in Gordy's engine
company, looks under the sheets with a cop.
(CONTINUED)
15.

CONTINUED:
48
Junior puts a gentle hand on Gordy's shoulder.
JUNIOR
Gordy.
Gordy looks up him, meets his eyes.
JUNIOR
Me and Mike are here.
GORDY
... I was late... They shouldn't
have been there...
JUNIOR
It's not your fault.
GORDY
I need to see them.
Mike has walked up, lays a comforting hand on Gordy.
MIKE
No. You don't need to see 'em
that way, Gordo.
Junior spots a news camera crew focusing on Gordy's
grief, calls at a cop.
JUNIOR
Get those goddamn people outta
here!
Phipps, approaching with Dray, addresses the same cop.
PHIPPS
Put that tape out fifty more
feet.
The cop begins moving the camera crew back.
Phipps
continues to Gordy.
A Paramedic looks up at Mike.
PARAMEDIC #1
He needs to go to the hospital.
We can't take that glass out.
MIKE
If he's not bleeding to death,
leave him. He's not moving till
they do.

Phipps has heard and understands.
To Dray, re:
bodies --
PHIPPS
Chalk 'em and move 'em.
Dray goes. Phipps turns to Gordy and the two
firefighters standing with him. Addresses Mike --
PHIPPS
We gotta get on this quick.
I
need to talk to him.
Beat.
Mike nods.
To Gordy --
PHIPPS
Mr. Pitt, if you can you tell
me... What'd you see?
GORDY
(looks up; beat)
What'd I see? I saw my family
die.
Mike puts a restraining hand on Gordy.
MIKE
This guy didn't do the bombing,
Gordo. He's just trying to get
the people who did.
Beat.
Gordy eases up.
Then, after a moment, defeated --
GORDY
I didn't see anything except the
explosion.
Beat.
Phipps sees that's all he's gonna get.
PHIPPS
I know this is hard. I'm sorry I
had to bother you.
Phipps goes. Gordy looks over as the bodies of Anne and
Matt are placed on gurneys and rolled away. Chalk
outlines are all that remain of his family. Beat.
MIKE
We're gonna roll you to the
hospital now and get that glass
out.

Walking back to the consulate.
He approaches Brandt.
PHIPPS
Joe Phipps. F.B.I. Counter-
terrorism task force.
BRANDT
Mike Brandt.
PHIPPS
What got this place blown up?
BRANDT
We'll have this discussion
somewhere else more secure, after
I get your clearance.
PHIPPS
Whatever it takes. But I got a
bomber in the wind. I need
everything you can give me, and I
need it now.

57
A bagpiper plays "Amazing Grace."
REVEAL Gordy holding Matt's small coffin as Anne's is
lowered into the ground. Gordy's men are around him,
along with many other NYFD personnel, family and friends.
A second bagpiper farther away in the cemetery, picks up
the song, begins playing it in a round with the first.
Matt's coffin is taken from Gordy.
As it is lowered...
A third bagpiper, farther away still, begins playing the
song with the other two. One by one the first and second
bagpipers finish their rounds, until there is just the
third -- a haunting, mournful wail off into the distance.
And then...
There's only silence.
58
83A
The four connected townhouses sit behind gates on a tree-
lined street in Georgetown. A sign reads: Latin
American Institute.
83B
88
The highway terminates here, far short of Colombia. The
idea is to inhibit the northbound migration of people and
drugs. From this point south lies the Darien Gap, a
thick rain forest traversed only by rough trail.
A cab with a Panama City logo pulls up at road's end.
Gordy gets out with the Panamanian CAB DRIVER. The Cab
Driver indicates a Panamanian man waiting there with a
.9mm on his hip.
CAB DRIVER
My cousin, Ever.
Ever and Gordy exchange nods.
GORDY
How far's Colombia?
The Cab Driver indicates distant mountains.
(CONTINUED)

88
CONTINUED:
88
CAB DRIVER
Beyond those mountains... The
trail is very dangerous, but do
not worry, Ever will get you
there... You can pay him then...
You can pay me now.
Gordy pulls out his wallet, pays the Cabbie.
CAB DRIVER
Gracias, senor.
The Driver gets back inside the cab.
Out the window --
CAB DRIVER
Que la vaya bien.
He drives off. Gordy looks to Ever. Ever smiles,
motions him to follow, then turns south and starts
walking. As Gordy falls in behind...
89
89
Gordy and Ever pass through pristine tropical rain
forest.
90
NEAR STREAM
90
rushing fiercely through the jungle, Ever uses his
machete to cut two lengths of bamboo. He hands one to
Gordy and indicates how they'll ford the stream. Gordy
nods, then follows Ever's lead into the perilous, belly-
deep water. They struggle to maintain their balance,
even with the sticks. When they reach the opposite bank,
Ever signs okay to Gordy and smiles.
91
HELICOPTER CARCASS
91
They pass the carcass of a crashed and burned-out
helicopter, when...
Two dangerous-looking men armed with assault rifles step
out of nowhere onto the path ahead of Gordy and Ever.
Gordy and Ever stop. Gordy glances at Ever. Ever's
focused on the men and clearly doesn't like what he sees.
Gordy looks back. The armed men advance toward them
carefully, rifles in the ready position. Gordy watches
them approach, wondering who they are and what they're
going to do. Ever, frightened, takes a half-step back,
then swings the length of bamboo fast and hard, and...
(CONTINUED)
39.
91
CONTINUED:
91
He smashes it into the base of Gordy's head, knocking
Gordy out.
The men run up. One man covers Gordy, while Ever and the
other man rifle his pack and toss his pockets. They take
his passport, wallet, and an NYFD T-shirt. And then
they're gone.
92
CLOSE ON HUMMINGBIRD
92
Hovering over Gordy as he comes to.
As it flies off...
92A
GORDY
92A
sits up. Feels the bloody lump on his head. It hurts,
but it's not serious. He searches his pockets and
backpack, realizes the passport and wallet are missing.
Gordy stands. Looks around. He's alone.
He's in the
jungle... He keeps heading south.
93
93
Gordy trudges on. The thick jungle's hot and humid,
full of STRANGE SOUNDS and shadowy animal movements.
Gordy's going uphill, when he rounds a bend in the trail,
and...
He meets a man coming the other way. Alarm gives way to
the realization that the man is followed by a number of
people, including women and children. As they pass
Gordy, it's apparent they're refugees from their haunted
expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions...
Gordy addresses the passing people.
Indicates where he's
standing.
GORDY
Aqui?
Colombia?...
No one replies. Then a small COLOMBIAN GIRL comes up and
gets his attention. She runs back up the trail a short
distance and stops. She draws a line in the dirt.
COLOMBIAN GIRL
Panama.
She jumps backward over the line.
(CONTINUED)
40.
93
CONTINUED:
93
COLOMBIAN GIRL
Colombia.
She does it again.
COLOMBIAN GIRL
Panama... Colombia.
She smiles. At the sound of a sharp WHISTLE, however,
she runs back quickly, passing Gordy and rejoining her
family. Her father hands her a machete and a Zippo
lighter, says something to her. Whereupon the little
girl returns to Gordy and holds the items out to him.
Beat. Gordy takes them.
GORDY
Gracias.
The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the
refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back
uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in
the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he
walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people
to flee for their lives, and...
Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement
past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he
now steps over the line and advances into Colombia.
94
94
Where the rain forest of Darien continues in Colombia.
Darkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill.
At
night, the JUNGLE'S EVEN NOISIER. When...
EVERYTHING GOES QUIET. Gordy slows. And suddenly,
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere. Not close, but
not far, either. A FEW BURSTS, some SINGLE SHOTS -- the
call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE. And
then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return.
As Gordy walks on...
95
95
The sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a
break in the trees, sees a small town ahead.
41.
96
NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER
96
Gordy has left the trail. He lowers his pants just
enough to expose his injured thigh. A bandage covers the
wound made by the glass shard. Gordy unwraps the
bandage, revealing...
A wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of
Anne and Matt. A long, livid scar marks the wound.
Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then
removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and
photo inside the bandage.
97
BACK ON TRAIL
97
Gordy heads into the town.
98
98
One of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that
ply Colombia's back-country roads.
As the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road, Gordy
sleeps. He's an object of some curiosity -- not only a
gringo, but a virtual Gulliver in comparison to the
small-statured Colombians pressed in around him.
99
99
A sprawling farm/estate deep in the countryside. Beyond
the hacienda, we see a military compound containing tents
and three heavily camouflaged helicopter shelters. A
recently arrived Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) sits
on a chopper pad with its rotors still turning.
100
102
Gordy bolts awake from the nightmare with a scream. He
looks around at the startled faces in the crowded bus,
unsure where he is for a moment before he gets his
bearings. The dream lingers, depressing him.
103
ANGLE - AHEAD OF CHIVA
103
An oncoming bus flashes its headlights. As the buses
pass, the ONCOMING DRIVER yells to Gordy's chiva driver.
ONCOMING DRIVER
Inspecion militar. Chequeo de
papeles.
104
SECOND CHIVA
104
keeps going. Gordy's chiva slows to a crawl, and the
Driver calls back.
GORDY'S CHIVA DRIVER
Inspecion militar. Chequeo de
papeles.
Various passengers gather their things and begin to
disembark in a hurry. To anyone who'll answer --
GORDY
Habla Ingles?... Que pasa?
A MAN IN A YANKEES CAP is among the people getting off.
He answers in accented English.
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
There is a military checkpoint up
the road. They inspect everyone's
papers.
105
BUS
105
starts to pick up speed again. Gordy gets off just in
time. To the Man in the Yankees Cap --
GORDY
Where are all of you going?
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
We walk around.
The man heads into the forest.
Beat.
Gordy follows.
44.
106
106
To the Man in the Yankees Cap as they walk --
GORDY
None of these people have papers?
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
Some have the wrong papers. Some
have none...
The man puts a finger to his lips, hushing Gordy.
They've come abreast of the checkpoint, which can be seen
in the distance through the trees. Colombian soldiers
have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection.
The chiva's DIESEL GROWLS loudly. When suddenly...
107
FIGURES
107
We see figures moving in the forest between the group and
the checkpoint. And then...
The forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS FIRE being directed at the soldiers at the
checkpoint. In the same instant, an RPG takes out a
Colombian Army humvee in a bright, fiery EXPLOSION.
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
Alsuelo!
108
MAN
108
The man pulls Gordy down as the group hits the dirt.
The
GUNFIRE continues. On the ground, to Gordy --
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
Guerrilleros.
The attack rages furiously for twenty seconds, then wanes
to sporadic GUNFIRE. Other WEAPONS are FIRING now,
too -- clearly the Army is finally mounting a defense.
And then...
109
FOREST
109
We hear the sound of PEOPLE CRASHING through the forest.
They're running toward Gordy and the group. The CRASHING
GETS CLOSER. And now Gordy begins to hear the BREATHLESS
PANTING of the guerrillas in retreat. BOOTS THUD past
Gordy's head. When suddenly...
(CONTINUED)
45.
109
CONTINUED:
109
One of the running guerrillas trips over Gordy and goes
sprawling. The guerrilla, wearing the motley uniform of
an irregular soldier, whips a look back, and...
Gordy finds himself staring into the battle-hardened eyes
of a fierce young woman. In a heartbeat...
The woman jumps back to her feet, and
joins her comrades
laying down a suppressing FIRE at the
soldiers. Spent
cartridges rain down around Gordy, as
the AK-47 ON FULL
AUTO chops loudly over his head. And
then...
110
NEW ANGLE
110
The guerrillas are gone.
The Man in the Yankees hat hauls Gordy up, yells --
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
Vaya!
The group is in the greatest danger now -- caught between
the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers, who are giving
chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them.
Everyone in the group scrambles to his or her feet and
begins to run. And...
Soldiers do notice them and begin to FIRE.
111
FOLIAGE
111
BULLETS SHRED the foliage around Gordy, whipping past his
head... He and others keep running. A man goes down when
a BULLET BITES into his leg. Gordy slows, but the Man in
Yankees Cap won't let him stop to help. Slams him hard
on his back. Keeps pushing Gordy forward. A few moments
later, we hear M-16's on FULL AUTO back where they left
the man.
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
His trouble is over.
112
112
The powerful TORRENT ROARS through the forest.
Gordy and the others reach the near bank, where the path
drops into the water to reappear on the opposite bank.
The Man in the Yankees Cap is in the lead. He plunges
into the fast water up to his waist. Gordy and the rest
splash in behind, struggling to cross against the swift
current. The Man in the Yankees Cap reaches the far
bank. Takes two steps, and...
46.
113
EXPLOSION
113
BOOM!
An EXPLOSION rips into him.
114
GORDY AND OTHERS
114
stop mid-stream, but one of the group, a young woman,
believing the blast was caused by the pursuing military,
continues struggling to cross. An OLDER MAN looks, sees
the blast-hole.
OLDER MAN
Mina.
Gordy realizes the old man's saying "land mine."
To the
young woman --
GORDY
No!
Gordy moves to catch her.
Just manages to stop her as
she reaches the far bank.
Gordy points to where the land
mine detonated.
GORDY
Mina... Mina...
Beat. Slowly, the terrified young woman responds to the
strong, calm tone of command in Gordy's voice and the
unpanicked, reassuring look on his face.
Gordy brings her back to the group, which fights to stand
in the rushing river. He indicates for them to hold
hands for stability. Motions for them to stay.
GORDY
Alto.
115
GORDY
115
leaves the group in the middle of the river. The GUNFIRE
is now FAR-OFF AND SPORADIC. He crosses to the water's
edge on the far bank. Pulls the Zippo from his pack and
leans over. Uses the flame to illuminate the mud and
rock immediately in front of him. Scratches lightly at
the ground with the machete, searching for mines. Finds nothing
in that spot. And steps onto it.
Searching the ground and scratching at it with the
machete before each step, Gordy inches toward the Man in
the Yankees Cap. Three steps from the river...
(CONTINUED)
47.
115
CONTINUED:
115
He finds a small, round anti-personnel mine the size of a
hockey puck. He inches past it. Moves past another.
And another. To the writhing Man in the Yankees Cap --
GORDY
Don't move... Don't move...
116
NEW ANGLE
116
Finally, Gordy reaches him. One of the man's legs is
missing below the knee. He's bleeding from various other
wounds as well. Gordy uses the Zippo to inspect the area
for more mines. Then kneels in a footprint.
GORDY
You'll be okay... You'll be okay.
He takes a bandanna from the man and ties a tourniquet
around his thigh. By way of distracting him --
GORDY
Guerrilla bastards.
MAN IN YANKEES CAP
No... Military... To stop
guerrillas.
Beat.
Gordy finishes the tourniquet, when he sees...
117
YOUNG MAN
117
has left the group and emerged from the river in a
different place to avoid the mines.
Gordy's eyes go to something glistening in front of the
young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground.
The kid's about to hit it. Gordy shouts --
GORDY
No!
Alto!
The young man hears the alarm in Gordy's voice and
stops... But not before he plants his next step, and...
The trip wire bows against his shin, and...
Gordy ducks, covers the Man in the Yankees Cap, and...
Nothing happens. The young man just stands there, frozen
in position, his leg still bowing the line.
(CONTINUED)
48.
117
CONTINUED:
117
Using the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to
the young man. He follows the trip wire to where a Coca-
Cola can hangs from a nearby tree. On closer inspection,
Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade.
There's no pin in the grenade. The can keeps the
grenade's arming spoon in place. The trip wire's
designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to
explode at chest level... And the can's almost off.
Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire. Then
carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade.

When Gordy returns, the man's dead.
OFF Gordy, looking
down at the NY logo on the cap...
119
119
Gordy sees a sign for a town as the chiva rumbles along.
He pulls out his map.
120
INSERT - MAP
120
Gordy finds the town, which lies along a river. He
traces a road from the town. The road runs south through
the town of Mompos, and eventually reaches Caguan, the
ELC capital.
121
BACK TO SCENE
121
A COLOMBIAN WOMAN is looking over Gordy's shoulder.
COLOMBIAN WOMAN
No autobusses para este lugar.
Solamente el barco en el rio.
She leans over, traces the river, which also runs to
Caguan.
COLOMBIAN WOMAN

The FERRY'S WHISTLE TOOTS.
Lines are cast off.

CONTINUED:
122
Two plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry
load and now relax their vigil. One man holds a Xerox of
Gordy's passport photo. The other bites into an
empanada, which breaks open and spills its contents down
the front of his shirt. His partner finds it funny. He
doesn't. And while their attention's occupied...
Gordy hurries by, oblivious to the federales' presence,
and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away.
123
123
The ferry's the only means of travel south, and it's
packed. Gordy picks his way through. The only other
gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme
hat that says "Deerborn." The geek, PHILIP ARMSTRONG,
looks like a talker, and Gordy tries to avoid eye
contact. He's too late.
ARMSTRONG
Hey, yo, dude, here's a seat, man!
GORDY
No, that's okay --
But Armstrong's already throwing a bag off the bench.
ARMSTRONG
I was hoping for someone I could
communicate with.
He sees Gordy hasn't moved.
ARMSTRONG
Only room's at the back near the
bano, and I'd advise against it,
unless you like poop.
Beat.
Gordy sits.
Immediately --
ARMSTRONG
Philip Armstrong. Assiniboia,
Sasketchewan, Canada.
(indicates his hat)
Deerborn Heavy Equipment.
GORDY
... Gordy Pitt.
ARMSTRONG
Hey, howya doing? I love Germany.

GORDY
Austria.
American now.
ARMSTRONG
I love America. Never been to
Austria. Where from in America
would that be?
GORDY
New York City.
ARMSTRONG
I don't like New York City.
Buildings're too big. What kinda
work you in?
GORDY
(hesitates, then)
Coffee. I buy beans.
ARMSTRONG
Can't drink caffeine. Makes my
stomach do the rumba. I like that
commercial guy with the sombrero
and the mule, though. Headed
upstream, eh? Where to?
GORDY
Caguan.
ARMSTRONG
... You've never been to Caguan,
eh?
GORDY
How do you know?
ARMSTRONG
'Cause no one in their right mind
would ever go back. Caguan's in
the guerrilla zone run by the
E.L.C. E.L.C. as in 'Extra
Loathsome Communists.' They don't
care, and they kill. I'm going
there myself. But I have a 'get
outta jail free' card.
Armstrong doffs his cap, undoes a safety pin securing a
card inside the crown. Shows it to Gordy. Sotto --

123
ARMSTRONG
E.L.C. travel pass. I can go
anywhere I want.
(by way of
explanation)
Everyone needs equipment fixed.
Armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat. And now
his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone --
ARMSTRONG
If you don't have one of these,
you don't want to be up there,
Gordy.
Beat. Gordy's contemplating the warning, when his eyes
go to a small, sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped
deck, leaning against his father. Gordy reaches over and
taps the boy. The boy looks over. Shrinks away at the
sight of the large gringo. The father notices and looks
at Gordy, who stands, indicates his seat.
GORDY
Por favor.
The father's also apprehensive, doesn't move.
GORDY
Con mucho gusto.
Finally, the father accepts, sits down with the sleepy
boy on his lap. Nods his thanks at Gordy, who then gazes
down at the son. A kid about Matt's age. Armstrong
recognizes the look of a caring dad.
ARMSTRONG
Got kids, eh?
OFF Armstrong, as Gordy walks away...
124
124
Two Colombian armed man wearing guerrilla uniforms
bearing a distinctive ELC patch are walking a trail, when
the man in front notices something odd. He stops. Leads
the other man back a few steps. Looks into the foliage
along the trail. Something doesn't seem right. He
extends his AK-47. Prods a hump of greenery with the
rifle butt, and in a flash...
The greenery suddenly transforms into two men wearing
face-paint and full-body military camouflage gear and
pointing twin cocked-and-locked CAR-15 assault rifles at
the heads of the startled guerrillas.
52.
125
125
Brandt stubs a butt as a Colombian SOG group does killer
training nearby. Updegraf opens the door. To Brandt --
UPDEGRAF
One of Rocha's infiltration teams
just radioed in... We got our big
break...
126
126
Gordy stands along the rail looking out at the lush,
beautiful countryside sliding past.
Armstrong joins him.
ARMSTRONG
That little kid and I had a nice,
long snooze... We're almost to
Mompos.
(gazing out)
Beautiful country.
GORDY
It better be.
A lotta people're
dying for it.
ARMSTRONG
(looks overboard)
Y'know, I haven't noticed one
darn body floating downstream
this whole trip, have you?
Gordy doesn't respond.
Beat.
GORDY
I was thinking... Maybe we could
travel together into Caguan. You
could show me around.
ARMSTRONG
(shakes his head)
Pass is only good for one person,
if that's your idea, which I think
it is... Besides, I can't risk
traveling around up there in the
company of a big gringo with a
dumb-ass cover story about coffee
beans.
Gordy looks over.
Armstrong smiles back.
Beat.
(CONTINUED)
53.
126
CONTINUED:
126
GORDY
I've got money. I'll buy the pass
from you.
ARMSTRONG
I've worked too hard for it. And
you don't have that kind of money
on you.
GORDY
I'll be getting some life
insurance money --
ARMSTRONG
(shaking his head)
It's all cash and carry down here,
Gordy.
The FERRY WHISTLE TOOTS.
ARMSTRONG
Mompos... You want to have some
fun, we'll hook up later. I
always schedule a stopover. To
sample the local wares and such.
(winks)
Life can be what you make it here
on the frontier.
GORDY
No, thanks.
ARMSTRONG
Gotta get off the boat anyway.
Mompos is the last stop. From
here into the guerrilla zone you
can only travel by panga... If you
change your mind, I'll be at the
Tropicale later. It's a gringo
bar. Just follow the cockroaches.
127
NEW ANGLE
127
They see the beginnings of Mompos. Two 4x4 trucks are
parked on the riverbank. Lean, clean-cut men in jeans,
tight shirts, cowboy boots and sunglasses lean on the
truck and watch the ferry pass.
ARMSTRONG
Sicarios. Death squads. Avoid
those dudes at all costs.
54.
128
SAME SCENE - FEW MOMENTS LATER
128
The ferry pulls up to the dock. The dock street is a
culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders,
of big-wheel SUVs and mule carts. There's a definite air
of menace.
ARMSTRONG
Federales are looking for someone.
Gordy follows Armstrong's look to two plain-clothes
federales, one fat and one thin, standing near the dock
watching the boat pull up.
When Gordy glances back, Armstrong is gone.
129
129
Gordy disembarks amid the throng of passengers, when the
FAT FEDERALE confronts him.
FAT FEDERALE
Senor Pitt?
Gordy looks up in surprise at him and the thin federale
backing him up.
FAT FEDERALE
You'll have to come with us.
GORDY
Why?
FAT FEDERALE
Come with us, please.
He clamps a hand on Gordy's arm. Gordy shakes it off and
starts running. Almost immediately, he's tackled to the
ground by the thin federale. Two more federales join in.
Gordy's not gonna go down easy, though.
Even as only one against four, Gordy's a formidable
challenge. He's strong, and he's committed all the way.
He's not getting kicked out of this country again. It's
not a clean or artful fight. There's no karate. It's
four men trying to tackle a bull, and...
The bull gets away.
130
130
Gordy sprints down streets with the federales in pursuit.
55.
131
GORDY
131
jukes into a local bar.
132
ANOTHER ANGLE
132
Gordy pounds out the back of the bar into a littered
courtyard, where he's surrounded by ten-foot walls.
133
FEDERALES
133
blast through the bar.
134
GORDY
134
runs, jumps, launches off a beer keg, and...
135
TOP OF WALL
135
He reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up.
He's looking out across a block-long run of corrugated
tin roofs. Takes off across the roofs, each step
thundering, as...
136
FEDERALES
136
burst into the courtyard. Two men hastily build a stack
of boxes, etc., against the wall.
137
GORDY
137
runs as fast as he can across the rooftops, when...
A section of roof gives way beneath his feet, just as...
138
NEW ANGLE
138
One of the federales finally mounts the wall, looks
across the rooftops... and Gordy's gone.
139
GORDY
139
lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice, beans
and coffee. The building is dark and dusty. He lies
still and listens. FOOTSTEPS approach across the tin
roof overhead. Gordy burrows into the bags of rice,
pulls them over him.
56.
140
FEDERALE
140
on the roof peers down through the hole. Scans the
warehouse room below with a mini-Mag-Lite.
141
GORDY
141
sees the flashlight beam move past. He holds his breath.
Beat. Then the FOOTSTEPS pass on, RECEDE down the roof.
And Gordy can breathe again.
142
142
Gordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier
town. A noisy, neon-lit strip of bars and brothels.
Everyone's packing a gun. A new Dodge City, where death
squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's BLARING SALSA.
143
144
The building's ancient, constructed of wood and adobe.
145
148
In a field near Mompos, a canopied truck backs into
position. Men in guerrilla uniforms with ELC patches get
out and pull back the canopy, revealing mortar tubes
pointing skyward on a bed of sand.
149
ELC GUERRILLA
149
unit armed with AK-47s and Light Anti-Tank Weapons
(LAWs) infiltrates the town.
150
ANOTHER TWO-MAN ELC GUERRILLA TEAM
150
sets up a single mortar position overlooking the town.
One of the men checks his watch. Beat. He signals. The
other man drops a MORTAR down the tube. WHUMP.
61.
151
TWO MORTARS
151
go in the tubes on the truck.
WHUMP, WHUMP.
152
ANOTHER ANGLE
152
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A water tower, the Mompos fire
station and the town's power supply are direct hits.
WHUMP, WHUMP, WHUMP...
153
154
As MORTARS CONTINUE to fall on the rest of the town, the
unit of guerrilla infiltrators open up on the front of
the jail with LAW ROCKETS.
155
155
KA-BOOM! The front door and wall of the jail
disintegrate under the multiple LAW attack.
156
NEW ANGLE
156
Brandt, Rocha and the soldiers, approaching the front
door inside, are hammered by the massive concussion of
the BLAST and flung across the room, apparently dead.
157
ANOTHER ANGLE
157
The powerful, concussive shock-wave channels into the
cell area. Gordy's slightly protected by a wall.
Armstrong, standing at the bars, is thrown into the
opposite wall and knocked unconscious.
158
GUERRILLAS
158
charge inside with AKs BLAZING.
Surviving soldiers and
federales SHOOT back.
The blasts have caused fires in the building. Severed
wires spark, creating more fire. Flames begin to spread
through the tinder-dry structure.
(CONTINUED)
62.
158
CONTINUED:
158
The guerrillas take out the soldiers and federales, with
few casualties to themselves. They make their way toward
the cell area.
EXPLODING AMMO and stored FUEL CANS accelerate the fire.
159
NEW ANGLE
159
The guerrillas reach the cells. Two men see Gordy and
draw down on him. The others move to the next cell.
Guerrillas plant small explosive charges on the hinges of
the cell containing their two captured comrades. Beat.
The HINGES BLOW. The beaten man and the rebel with him
are freed, and the guerrillas quickly retreat the way
they came.
Gordy sees flames spreading into the cell area.
160
GUERRILLAS
160
exit the fiery jail past Brandt.
We see Brandt's not
dead.
161
161
A truck pulls up. The guerrillas get in.
The TRUCK
SCREECHES OUT as...
162
4X4
162
full of sicarios SKIDS onto the street, far ahead of the
truck. The sicario driving punches it, and...
163
TWO TRUCKS
163
ROAR toward each other. A game of chicken. With GUNS.
Men in both vehicles OPEN UP -- the sicarios with magnums
and Uzis, the guerrillas with AKs. SLUGS RIP through
automotive steel. Casualties are taken. When...
164
SICARIO
164
driving the 4x4 receives a round in the forehead, cranks
over the steering wheel, and...
63.
165
SPEEDING 4X4
165
does a Paris-to-Dakar road rally flip, twisting and
somersaulting, and...
166
NEW ANGLE
166
The 4x4 catapults completely over the guerrillas' truck,
disintegrating into spare parts and dead occupants, as...
167
GUERRILLAS
167
ROAR off.
168
168
A severely-dazed Brandt, bleeding from the nose and ears,
slowly gets to his knees, crawls out of the burning
building and collapses outside.
169
170
The town's in complete chaos.
There are fires
everywhere.
(CONTINUED)
64.
170
CONTINUED:
170
Still stunned and bleeding, Brandt looks from where he
lies on the ground as...
Gordy bursts out of the inferno carrying Armstrong.
They're singed and smoking, but they're alive. Gordy
drops Armstrong, pats himself and Armstrong down,
knocking out the burning embers on their clothes and
hair, when...
Gordy's eyes meet Brandt's. The two men hold the look
for a moment. If Brandt could speak, he'd be yelling at
Gordy to stop, not to go on. And Gordy knows it. But
Gordy's not stopping. Picks up Armstrong again and moves
off toward the waterfront.
171
171
There's less chaos here.
The fires are in the distance.
Gordy arrives carrying Armstrong.
Sets him down.
GORDY
I'll find a boat to take us
upriver.
He starts to go.
Armstrong stops him.
ARMSTRONG
No. I told you. The pass is only
good for one person. And you're
too dangerous to travel with.
Beat. Gordy reaches over and takes Armstrong's cap.
He
looks inside. There's no pass.
ARMSTRONG
It hasn't been there since we
landed.
Gordy's at a loss. He tosses the cap back.
Just looks
at Armstrong. Beat. Armstrong sighs.
ARMSTRONG
Aw, hell... I was through with
this place anyway...
He takes off a boot. Shakes out some money and the pass.
He hands the pass to Gordy.
(CONTINUED)
65.
171
CONTINUED:
171
ARMSTRONG
I'll call ahead and tell Felix I'm
not coming, and you're my
replacement. He'll meet you in
Caguan and take you to the
plantation... What do you know
about diesel engines?
GORDY
All the fire trucks are diesels.
ARMSTRONG
You'll have to be Austrian, eh?
They hate Americans. Name's gotta
change, too, in case they're
watching the news.
(beat)
It'll buy you a little time to
look around Caguan. But you'll
never find The Wolf.
Beat.
Gordy sticks out his hand.
GORDY
Heinrich Beckmann.
ARMSTRONG
Huh?
GORDY
My Austrian name.
Armstrong shakes hands with Gordy.
Armstrong doesn't
let loose right away. Beat.
ARMSTRONG
Luck got you this far. But up
there, luck doesn't make it.
I hope you know you're gonna die.
OFF Gordy, about to step over another line...
172
172
As dawn breaks over the river, FIND Gordy sitting in a
motored panga being steered by a local BOATMAN. Gordy
reaches into a pocket and pulls out the photo of Anne and
Matt. He looks at it for a few moments. Then pockets it
again.
173
SAME SCENE - LATER
173
The panga passes a dead body floating downstream.
66.
174
SAME SCENE - LATER
174
The panga passes revolutionary banners and signs lining
the riverbank.
BOATMAN
La zona guerrillera.
175
SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
175
The panga rounds a bend, and...
Two souped-up bass boats filled with heavily-armed ELC
guerrillas move to intercept it.
The Boatman slows, puts the panga in neutral and keeps
his hands in sight.
One boat of guerrillas pulls alongside. The other sheers
off and stops a short distance away, ready to open fire.
Gordy shows the guerrillas his travel pass. One of them
takes it. Reads. Looks Gordy over. Then starts to rip
the pass in half, when...
He stops. Grins. It's a big joke. He hands back the
pass, searches the boat quickly and waves the panga on.
OFF Gordy's relief as the panga heads on...
176
176
The panga arrives, and Gordy gets out. He's met by
FELIX. Felix has a 9mm in a shoulder holster. Felix
doesn't look the least bit happy.
FELIX
Beckmann.
GORDY
Yeah.
FELIX
Come with me.
Felix leads him towards a Land Cruiser.
FELIX
Armstrong should have called
sooner. We don't like changes
here... If I didn't need the
equipment fixed, I'd send you
back.
(CONTINUED)
67.
176
CONTINUED:
176
They reach the Land Cruiser.
FELIX
But now we have to see the E.L.C.
Supervisor for Caguan.
It's a prospect that seems to concern Felix almost as
much as Gordy. Off which, as they get into the Toyota...
177
178
Gordy and Felix pull away from the Supervisor's H.Q.
Felix resumes his former tone of command.
FELIX
The Supervisor made you my
responsibility... You don't go
anywhere without me, you
understand?
GORDY
No problemo.
Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive,
looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf,
searching the face of every man. He doesn't see The
Wolf, but what he does see surprises him. The ELC
Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos. It's a third-
world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot
of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here
the streets are calm and orderly. It's quiet, almost
eerie, as people go about their business. OFF Gordy,
seeing another side of the guerrillas...
179
179
Felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the
plantation. The entrance is guarded by a 4X4 "Rat
Patrol" assault truck and four heavily armed ELC
guerrillas.
GORDY
The E.L.C. guards your coffee
beans?
Felix thinks he's joking. Until he looks over and sees
Gordy's actually being sincere.
(CONTINUED)
69.
179
CONTINUED:
179
FELIX
... Coffee beans? Shit.
Armstrong didn't tell you much...
180
180
They approach a hacienda and outbuildings. The
accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors,
sheds, cats, etc. -- but clearly, this is no family farm.
There are lots of serious-looking men around. More ELC
guerrillas stand guard.
181
FELIX
181
stops the car. He and Gordy get out. Felix begins
leading Gordy toward two rows of long, open-walled sheds.
FELIX
The problem's with the diesel
generators. The sons-of-bitches
keep breaking down.
182
NEW ANGLE
182
They pass four very large pits, where green leaves steep
in a thick, foul-smelling liquid.
FELIX
We're using portables to keep
production going, but they don't
supply enough power to the heat
lamps, and we have to dry a lot
of... 'coffee beans.'
183
ANOTHER ANGLE
183
They're now walking between the two rows of sheds, where
portable gas GENERATORS THRUM, and...
Gordy can see long, wide platforms inside. Above the
platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps.
Spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two
of converted cocaine.
184
IN ANOTHER SHED
184
workers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for
shipment.
70.
185
GORDY AND FELIX
185
approach the two giant diesel generators.
FELIX
We can fix anything, but these
keep dying on us... You'll start
now. I'll have tools brought to
you.
(beat)
Armstrong's a magician with them.
Let's hope you have his skill.
Felix walks over to a guerrilla with an AK-47 and speaks
to him. Then goes. Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to
Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him.
186
SAME SCENE - LATER
186
Gordy has the diesels partially dismantled. The
guerrilla sentry is still right there. Felix returns.
FELIX
Well?
Gordy has to think of something fast.
Beat.
He throws a
machine part against a wall angrily.
GORDY
I can't work with these pieces of
junk.
FELIX
Junk? These generators cost a
fortune.
GORDY
Then treat them that way.
FELIX
(beat, then)
Armstrong always fixes them.
GORDY
Armstrong wants your money. He
makes them work, but he doesn't
fix them... To do this right, we
gotta order parts from Europe.
In the meantime, I can make
something temporary. There must
be a machine shop in town.
FELIX
... Yes.
(CONTINUED)
71.
186
CONTINUED:
186
Gordy stands.
GORDY
Let's go.
OFF Felix, forced to acquiesce...
187
187
Felix is driving. Again, Gordy uses the opportunity to
look for The Wolf. It's a long-shot, and he knows it.
But it's all he can do.
188
EMPTY STOREFRONT
188
They pass an empty storefront. A sign on the large,
front plate glass window says "Cine" and "Sabado."
189
BAR
189
They pass a bar. Felix watches it go by with something
like a look of desire. Gordy registers the look and the
connection to the bar.
190
191
Gordy finishes loading the parts into the Land Cruiser.
FELIX
Let's get moving.
GORDY
I'm thirsty. How about you?
Want
to get something to drink?
Felix pauses. We see the look of desire again. Gordy's
definitely struck a chord. But Felix quickly stifles it.
FELIX
We have to get back.
(CONTINUED)
72.
191
CONTINUED:
191
GORDY
I've been working all day out in
the sun. I need a drink... nice
cold beer? How about it? I saw a
bar in town.
Felix really wants to, but still hesitates.
GORDY
With the spare parts, I'll have
the generators running in two
hours... We have time for a
couple beers.
Beat.
Finally --
FELIX
Okay.
Just a beer. Maybe two.
192
193
The two guerrillas are just driving away in a big-
wheeled, high ground-clearance Suburban as Gordy and
Felix emerge. Felix is weaving.
(CONTINUED)
74.
193
CONTINUED:
193
Gordy keeps his eyes on the Suburban's tail lights and
opens the Land Cruiser's passenger door for Felix.
GORDY
You're too drunk. I'll drive.
194
194
Gordy gets in. Felix hands Gordy the keys.
Then slumps
against his door and closes his eyes.
FELIX
One day, I'm going to screw Berta.
Gordy STARTS the CAR and drives after the Suburban.
195
195
Gordy follows the Suburban as Felix rambles --
FELIX
... I'll take her to a small
restaurant... We'll have lobster
and drink lots of wine... I'll get
her drunk... We'll drive home...
I'll carry her inside... I'll kiss
her... And then, I'll screw her in
my bed...
The Suburban pulls up next to a house.
There are armed
guerrilla guards outside.
FELIX
... And when I am done screwing
her, she'll never want to look at
another man again...
Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the
guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start
carrying the beer inside. And a moment later...
Felix comes around with a start.
FELIX
What the fuck are you doing?!
He unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy.
GORDY
Hey, easy... What's the problem?
(CONTINUED)
75.
195
CONTINUED:
195
FELIX
You're going the wrong goddamn
way!
GORDY
I am?... Looks different in the
dark...
FELIX
Turn around!
Gordy turns the car around.
Felix keeps the gun on him.
FELIX
You drive where I say... Or the
Supervisor will have us both shot.
Gordy drives back. They approach the Suburban and the
house once more. This time it's on Felix' side. Felix
gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and...
Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the
other way: a large propane tank next to the house.
196
196
The work in the sheds continues.
Heat lamps dry down the
long tables of coke.
197
GUERRILLA GUARDS
197
are more vigilant at night, patrolling the grounds with
posted teams.
198
WORK LIGHTS
198
illuminate the two big diesel generators as Gordy
continues his overhaul. He has two sentries now. One
wears a combat vest, and as Gordy works, his eyes go to
the grenades hanging on the vest's front.
199
199
The sun's over the yardarm now, blazing hot, and Gordy's
still working under the watchful eyes of the guards.
Nearby, a group of guerrillas is playing soccer, when...

CONTINUED:

A man is injured, and his teammates call for one of
Gordy's guards to substitute. The man in the combat vest
responds. The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining
the skins. Puts down his AK, strips off his combat vest
and shirt, and runs in.
Gordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades.
With the other guard still watching him closely, however,
there's nothing Gordy can do.
200
SAME SCENE - LATER
200
The soccer game rages back and forth. Suddenly, an open
man gets the ball. Breaks toward the goal.
Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the
goalie. He cheers the action loudly, whereupon...
Gordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and...
Gordy grabs a grenade.
Almost gets it into a tool box,
when...
The player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and...
Gordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping
into the tool box by picking up a large wrench... But the
grenade's still visible as now...
Felix comes around the corner. He's sleepy and hungover.
And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress.
FELIX
It's afternoon. Yesterday, you
said it would only take two more
hours.
Gordy wipes his hands on a rag, throws it on the grenade.
GORDY
I have this one ready to go.
Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the
GENERATOR. It SPUTTERS, but won't catch. Felix just
looks at him. Gordy makes an adjustment, and...
This time,
the ENGINE TURNS OVER. PURRS like new. The
heat lamps
brighten in a row of sheds. Felix winces as
the DIESEL
ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head
pound even
harder.
FELIX
What about the other one?
(CONTINUED)
77.
200
CONTINUED:
200
GORDY
I just need another part from
town, and it's five more minutes.
FELIX
... Shit.
Fine. Let's go.
Gordy grabs the tool box.
FELIX
Why're you bringing the tool box?
GORDY
The old part's in there. I need
to match it, and it's all greasy.
Felix buys it and heads off.
As Gordy follows him...
201
201
They pass the "Cine" in the storefront. The ELC
Supervisor's big-screen TV is being wheeled in.
202
GORDY
202
sees an attractive woman playing with some children.
203
GORDY AND FELIX
203
drive past the bar.
Gordy notices Felix doesn't even
glance at it.
GORDY
Berta working today?
FELIX
Ha!
Puta!
We see that, whatever this means, it's an unexpected
complication for Gordy.
204
205
Gordy loads the part into the Land Cruiser.
To Felix --
GORDY
You as thirsty as I am?
FELIX
No.
Felix gets into the Land Cruiser.
206
206
Gordy climbs in.
Felix starts driving.
Gordy's down to
final straws.
GORDY
We can't stop for one beer?
FELIX
There's beer at the plantation.
GORDY
(thinking fast)
There's no Berta at the
plantation. I like drinking beer
around pretty girls, not a bunch
of guys with automatic rifles.
FELIX
To hell with Berta.
GORDY
What happened? Last night you
were in love with her.
There's a beat. Felix glances at Gordy.
Decides it's
safe to confide.
FELIX
... I had a dream... I fed her
lobster, got her drunk, and she
rejected me for another man.
(off Gordy's look)
Dreams tell the future.
GORDY
... That wasn't a dream, that was
the alcohol talking... You saying
two men can't go have a beer and
look at women's breasts because
of pink elephants?... Nothing
makes any sense down here.
(CONTINUED)
79.
206
CONTINUED:
206
Felix pulls out his .9mm.
Gordy doesn't blink an eye.
GORDY
Go ahead and shoot me, and you
fix the goddamn generator. Part's
in the back.
Beat.
OFF Felix, thinking it all over...
207
208
Gordy drops out the bathroom window.
209
209
Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box. He slides it
just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked
over the waistband. He finds some wire. Then searches
for something else. Finds a piece of string and checks
its length. From Gordy's reaction, we understand it's
too short.
Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets. Nothing. He
checks the glove box. No long string there, either. But
he does find two rubber bands. Gordy studies them a
moment, thinking. Tests their elasticity. Then pulls
out the Zippo and thumbs it. The lighter still works.
As Gordy pockets everything and walks off...
210
210
Gordy steals through town, hiding when he sees someone
coming. He's re-tracing the route he took the night
before, when he followed the Beaten Man's Suburban.
80.
211
"CINE"
211
He passes the "Cine" in the storefront. A movie's
beginning to play on the supervisor's big-screen TV.
The
place is packed. No one sees Gordy, who moves on.
212
GORDY
212
continues to make his way through Caguan, when...
He rounds a corner, and there's a four-man ELC patrol,
two in a truck and two out. Gordy turns, starts heading
back, when...
One of the GUERRILLAS calls to him.
GUERRILLA
Alto!
Gordy stops. The two standing men walk toward him. The
other two men get out of the truck to provide backup.
One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands
off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up. Gordy
carefully produces the travel pass. The guerrilla looks
it over. In butchered Spanish --
GORDY
Yo trabajo con Felix. Felix --
(indicates)
-- la cantina. Con Berta.
The attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the
children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy.
A
guerrilla waves them on. The woman and boy hustle by,
glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as
they pass. They hurry on toward the nearby "Cine."
OFF Gordy, as the guerrilla indicates for him to start
walking to the truck...
213
215
Felix is right there supervising for himself as Gordy
finishes working. Gordy stands. He stares hopefully at
the MACHINE. Then pushes the starter, and... VRROOM!
The heat lights in the second row of sheds brighten.
Gordy turns to Felix.
GORDY
That make you happy?
No response.
GORDY
Where's my money?
FELIX
You'll get it in the morning.
82.
216
217
The big-wheeled guerrilla Suburban drives in.
218
219
The Beaten Man finishes with Felix. Felix begins leading
the guerrillas toward the storeroom.
220
221
WHAM-WHAM-WHAM, one of the DIESELS Gordy repaired suffers
a spectacularly loud internal breakdown. The heat lights
dim in a row of sheds. Felix and the guerrillas stop to
see what's happening. At which point, the generator now
BURSTS into FLAMES.
222
BACK TO GORDY
222
He smiles.
GORDY
Just in time...
And we realize that he'd planned on the diversion, as...
The water jet breaks through.
The hole's still small.
Gordy begins to widen it.
84.
223
223
Felix, the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume
their march toward the storeroom.
They reach the storeroom. Water's pouring out under the
door. Felix unlocks the door and opens it to find...
224
225
The guerrillas report to the Beaten Man. They can't find
Gordy. To the men guarding the plantation --
BEATEN MAN
(in Spanish)
Keep looking.
He signals his men to come with him.
They get into the
Suburban. Whereupon we FIND...
226
UNDER SUBURBAN
226
Gordy's hanging onto the chassis. With the large tires
and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to
get his legs over the rear axle. He's just finishing
rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the
rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other,
to support Gordy's back. He hears the ENGINE START,
grabs the transfer case, and...
85.
227
SUBURBAN
227
ROARS off with Gordy suspended below.
The rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly, inches from Gordy's
face. And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy-
duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of
the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's
legs. ROCKS are PINGING everywhere. The dirt and the
dust are choking. Even for a short distance, it's going
to be a long, dangerous ride.
228
228
As the TRUCK BLASTS down back roads and through the
darkened town...
229
GORDY
229
continues to suffer underneath. Even with the rope
supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands.
A vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. It starts to
slip free. Gordy can't stop it without letting go. The
grenade falls, and...
Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. Barely. The spoon
just hanging on the end of his fingertips. Gordy can't
use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold
onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to
lose it. And just as it falls...
Gordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger
through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags
the grenade before it drops to the road. And then...
Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar
the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and
screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer
case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach,
where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back.
Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to
relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm.
230
ABOVE GORDY'S WORLD
230
the Suburban passes the "Cine."
The movie's over, just
letting out.
231
231
The Suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house Gordy saw
the night before. The men get out and go inside, leaving
the SUBURBAN RUNNING, clearly planning to leave again
right away.
86.
232
GORDY
232
carefully lowers himself to the ground. Slides out on
the side away from the house. Hides behind a large
wheel. The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut
trees. Gordy watches the guards. When the guards aren't
looking, he runs to the nearest tree. The sounds of the
SUBURBAN'S ENGINE covers his footsteps.
233
TREES
233
Gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't
looking, when he reaches one tree, and...
234
NEW ANGLE
234
THUNK!
A coconut hits the ground next to him, and...
One of the guards comes to investigate.
The guard gets closer. Gordy inches around the tree. He
can't get away without being seen. He nudges the coconut
with his toe. Nudges it harder, causing it slowly to
roll away, and...
The guard picks it up. Never sees Gordy in the shadow of
the tree, pressed against the trunk. The guard shows the
coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back.
235
GORDY
235
sneaks to another tree. Then reaches the house. He
moves to a window. Peers into a room. No one's there.
But we hear the sound of VOICES. Gordy creeps along the
wall. Looks into another room, and...
236
INSIDE
236
is a group of ELC guerrillas, including the Beaten Man,
packing suitcases, etc. Leaving in a hurry.
237
GORDY
237
scans the faces. Except for the Beaten Man, no face is
familiar. A man with his BACK TO us stands, and there's
nothing familiar about him, either. When...
238
ANOTHER ANGLE
238
Directly in front of us, another man emerges from a room.
He's also in ELC guerrilla camo.
(CONTINUED)
87.
238

OFF Gordy, looking intently at the man.

His face looms larger as he ADVANCES

242
CLOSE ON MAN (PRESENT)
242
in the room.
It's the same face.
243
BACK TO GORDY
243
He's found The Wolf, when...
Suddenly, a guard appears, and...
Gordy freezes. Eases into the shadows. His dirty face
and clothes blend in just enough. The guard moves past.
244
ANOTHER ANGLE
244
When the coast is clear, Gordy moves to the large propane
tank. He takes out the grenade. Puts the rubber bands
around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand,
holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then...
Slowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing
the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring-
loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now,
Gordy's going up in the blast.
Gordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands
stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're
barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it.
Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane
tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and
removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the
cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his
fingers. And...
(CONTINUED)
88.
244
CONTINUED:
244
Lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands.
Gordy
squeezes out as much as he can onto them.
Then Gordy gets the hell out of there.
He finds cover.
Ducks down. And waits.
245
CLOSEUP - GRENADE
245
The lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands.
246
BACK TO SCENE
246
Gordy suddenly hears a woman's gentle SINGING.
He looks
in the direction of the sound, and...
Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching
on the road. She's singing a gentle song in Spanish.
Gordy's eyes flash with alarm.
He glances at the house.
247
CLOSEUP - GRENADE
247
The lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands,
which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and
stretch from the pressure of the spoon.
248
BACK TO SCENE

Gordy looks back at the Woman and boy, closer now,
walking toward the house.

FLASHBACK - NEW YORK

Anne and Matt wave to him across Madison Avenue.

Gordy sees the Woman pull the boy close to her, lovingly.

The BOMB EXPLODES, and Anne moves to protect Matt.

He realizes the horror of what will happen.
And...

WIDER
Gordy bursts from his hiding place.
GORDY
No!
Stop!
Alto!
The Woman and Boy look over in alarm, see Gordy running
toward them and yelling.
GORDY
Get back!
253
INSERT - GRENADE
253
The rubber bands are about to break.
254
BACK TO SCENE

The Woman sees Gordy.
Screams toward the house --
WOMAN
Claudio!!
255
GUARDS
255
see Gordy running.
They OPEN FIRE.
256
MEN
256
pile out of the house.
257
GUARDS
257
STOP FIRING.
Gordy's too close to the Woman and Boy now.
258
GORDY
258
reaches the Woman and Boy now. Pulls them down.
Covers
them protectively with his body, when...
259
NEW ANGLE
259
KA-BOOM! A gigantic EXPLOSION lights up the night and
utterly destroys the house.
90.
260
DEBRIS
260
rains down for what seems like forever.
Dust fills the
air.
261
GORDY
261
opens his eyes. Gets to his hands and knees.
Sees the
Woman and Boy are safe, when...
A vicious kick in the ribs lifts Gordy off the ground,
rolling him away from the Woman and child.
THE WOLF
You bastard!
The Wolf's alive and unhurt.
Angrily punts Gordy again.
THE WOLF
You think you can kill The Wolf?!
A boot in the face this time.
THE WOLF
You think you can kill The Wolf?!
A piece of paper has fallen from one of Gordy's pockets
and fluttered to the ground nearby. The woman picks it
up, and we see...
It's the photo of Anne and Matt.
The woman stares at the photo a moment, as...
Gordy absorbs another blow.
He tries to stand.
GORDY
You killed my wife and son --
Whack! The Wolf slams the butt of an AK-47 against
Gordy's skull. Gordy drops hard. The Wolf reverses the
AK. Points it at Gordy's head, about to pull the
trigger, when...
The Woman lays a hand on The Wolf's arm.
WOMAN
Claudio.
The Wolf doesn't take his eyes off Gordy.
The Woman
squeezes his arm. Implores him --
WOMAN
Claudio.
(CONTINUED)
91.
261
CONTINUED:
261
The Wolf glances over. Meets her eyes a moment. Sees
the photo in her hand. Glances up into her eyes again.
They hold the look. A whole conversation exchanged
without words. Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy, lying
in a pile on the ground. Beat. To Gordy --
THE WOLF
You were just saved by your
guardian angel.
262
271
It's RAINING buckets. Most of the people inhabiting the
village have been driven under roofs or indoors.
Guerrillas drag Gordy roughly up out of the bunker into
the tropical DOWNPOUR. They march him out into the open.
Throw him to the ground. A man draws his pistol as Gordy
gets to his hands and knees. The GUERRILLA puts the
pistol to Gordy's forehead.
GUERRILLA
It's time, gringo.
Beat.
He extends a bar of soap with his other hand.
GUERRILLA
Bath time... You stink, gringo.
The guerrillas laugh. Gordy throws the soap in the mud.
Gets to his feet. Points his face up into the soothing
rain... When he hears ARGUING and looks over to see...
272
WOLF AND SELENA
272
are inside a small house nearby, obviously fighting about
something. Selena emphasizes her argument by slapping
her hand. The Wolf storms off, and we hear a DOOR SLAM.
Selena is left alone, disconsolate, framed in the window.
She looks up and sees Gordy outside. Her eyes meet his.
OFF their look...
99.
273
273
It's POURING here, too. In b.g., assault preparations
are underway in spite of the rain. Brandt checks his
watch. Then lights another butt from the one he just
smoked. Stares off into the distance, his thoughts
intense and far away. Updegraf emerges, crosses.
UPDEGRAF
The weather system's intensifying.
BRANDT
(distracted; beat)
What?
UPDEGRAF
The storm's gonna be real bad for
at least twelve hours. Here's the
data.
He hands a paper to Brandt. Cops a puff off Brandt's
cigarette while Brandt reads.
UPDEGRAF
Air ops says it's too heavy for
the Blackhawks. Also, Sat-Intel
is saying the clouds're too thick,
and we're blind.
BRANDT
(beat; pissed)
Got any good news?
UPDEGRAF
Yeah. The creeks are rivers
around Caguan. Unless The Wolf's
a fish, he's not moving... And
there's fresh coffee.
BRANDT
Only good thing down here... Put
everyone on red till tomorrow
night. And then, I don't care if
there's a typhoon, I want those
fucking rotors turning.
Beat. Updegraf goes. Brandt crumples the fax and
pitches it. Then sees he got fax ink on his hands. OFF
Brandt, holding his mitts out in the rain, trying to wash
off the stains...
274
276
The front's moved through.
The night is clear.
277
277
Water drips from jungle leaves and the eaves of
buildings. We see the bustling life of the place, the
families, the women and children who live with and
support the well-organized and high-tech guerrilla
military. The village is simple but decidedly not
primitive. These people have generators, a satellite
dish and a school with a computer. At night, the school
is a TV room. Right now on the tube Daffy's getting his
beak blown off.

MAURO

sits next to Selena on the porch of a house. He plays
with the shells of her bracelet as she stares off into
the night.
281
281
The Blackhawks, black and menacing, sit on an illuminated
tarmac as:
Heavily armed troops in black uniforms and assault vests
load up.
Door gunners check mini-guns.
Ground crews yank arming ribbons on rocket pods.
A co-pilot in a specially rigged helmet tests his forward
mini-gun: wherever he looks, the gun points.
Pilots finish checklists, and...
Chopper ENGINES start WHINING. ROTORS begin to TURN.
The noise mounts to an incredible ROAR.
282
ANGLE - L.O.H.
282
The small helicopter's rotors are also turning. Brandt
stands at the chopper door with Updegraf. Slams the
magazine on a Glock .45, making sure it's in solid, then
slides the pistol into his shoulder holster. He checks
his watch. Loud, to Updegraf --
BRANDT
It's time to make The Wolf howl.
He takes a last drag on his cigarette, passes the butt to
Updegraf to finish and gets in the rear of the L.O.H. as
Updegraf scoots clear.
283
L.O.H.
283
THROTTLES UP and SCREAMS away.
284
BLACKHAWKS
284
one by one in quick succession, lift off the deck and
follow the L.O.H. into the night sky.
103.
285
286
The Blackhawks and L.O.H. fly map-of-the-earth, a few
feet over triple-canopy rain forest.
287
289
Gordy and Selena ascend the bunker steps. They stop at
the top and peer into the village. An armed guerrilla
approaches, unaware of their presence. Gordy fumbles
with the AK-47, looking for the safety switch on the
strange weapon. Selena reaches over and expertly flicks
it off. When...
They hear the sound of the CHOPPERS.
The guerrilla approaching them stops and looks up.
And...
290
ANOTHER ANGLE
290
WHOOM! The first wave of BLACKHAWKS FLASHES OVER the
village. Selena and Gordy barely have time to duck as
ROCKETS EXPLODE into ground targets, and front and door
MINI-GUNS SPIT BULLET-STREAMS that RIP THROUGH people and
STRUCTURES. And then the first wave's past.
291
GUERRILLAS
291
In the momentary lull after the first wave, guerrillas
run to pre-arranged fighting positions. Women and
children are screaming.
292
SELENA
292
pulls Gordy from the steps. They start to run. But not
far. Just seconds after the first wave of Blackhawks has
left, the second wave hits.
293
BLACKHAWK CO-PILOT'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)
293
The village and all its details are visible as different
shades of green.
We see rockets streak toward parked guerrilla vehicles.
We see rockets trail fire toward the TV in the school,
which is then obliterated in a FIERY EXPLOSION.
Wherever the co-pilot looks, the forward MINI-GUN aims
its hellish RAIN OF BULLETS. We TRACK WITH a running
guerrilla and see him chopped down, then SWIVEL TO a gun
pit and watch the men there eat lead.
294
GORDY
294
He sees the burning school. Watches the continuing
slaughter caused by the ROCKETS and MINI-GUNS.
105.
295
298
Two thermite parachute FLARES SHOOT from rocket tubes and
IGNITE. Immediately after, the L.O.H. banks. And...
The SAM ZIPS past the hot, bright flares.
299
299
The second wave's gone. Gordy and Selena start to run
again. Buildings burn. The SCREAMING's endless. Gordy
almost trips over the burned body of a child. And now...
300
THIRD WAVE
300
BLASTS in over the treetops. These are the Blackhawks
carrying the assault troops. They use a "skid 'n' git"
maneuver to insert the men, coming in hot, MINI-GUNS
BLAZING, barely touching down as the soldiers spill out,
then tipping forward to gain speed and quick peeling out
in a hard right turn.
Gordy and Selena hit the dirt again as the choppers come
in and land the troops, and the ground BATTLE ERUPTS.
The assault team's GROUND COMMANDER, an American Army
Captain, radios his men via comm-link --
GROUND COMMANDER
We're going for body count.

301
GORDY AND SELENA
301
There's a break in the fighting nearest them. They jump
up and start running for the trees edging the compound.

Gordy and Selena sprout from the ground and run.
The
SOLDIER OPENS FIRE.

BULLETS TWITCH the smoke around them. A SLUG PLUCKS the
AK from Gordy's hand. They're almost to the trees.
304
SOLDIER ON GROUND'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)
304
Gordy and Selena are in his sights.
They'll never make
the trees. When...
The Soldier's head WHIPS AROUND TO FACE a guerrilla
FIRING at him. He KILLS the guerrilla. Then looks back
at Gordy and Selena, and...
They're gone.
Into his comm-link --
SOLDIER (O.S.)
Two in the jungle.
GROUND COMMANDER (V.O.)
Hunt 'em.
305
305
Sounds of GUNFIRE. EXPLOSIONS in the compound flicker
light through the dense foliage. Selena leads Gordy to
a bush and pulls back leaves, revealing Mauro, cowering
fearfully, clutching an old leather doll to his chest.
Selena takes Mauro's hand, grabs a small pack lying next
to him, then leads Gordy off through the jungle.
306
SOLDIER'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)
306
He SEARCHES the jungle. Up ahead, Selena, Mauro and
Gordy are visible for a split second when they run
through a gap between in the foliage. The Soldier moves
after them.
107.
307
307
Selena, Mauro and Gordy reach the fast-flowing water.
SELENA
We have to swim.
Gordy spies two empty fuel cans nearby. He gets the
cans, throws them in. Then picks up Mauro.
GORDY
Go!
Selena jumps in. Gordy and Mauro follow. They swim for
the fuel cans. Gordy, with Mauro clinging to his neck
and still clutching the doll, gets an arm over one can.
Selena just manages to grab the other.
308
SOLDIER'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)
308
He REACHES the river. Sees Gordy, Mauro and Selena
bobbing downstream hanging onto the cans. OPENS FIRE.
309

BULLETS WHIP the water around Gordy, Mauro and Selena.
They hide behind the cans. BULLETS PING OFF the METAL.
They're swept through some rocks, blocking them from the
Soldier, who FIRES anyway. BULLETS CHIP the STONE.
There's one more clear shot after the rocks. They're
almost around a bend. The Soldier aims. BANGS! And...
Selena's hit.
Gasps.
Gordy looks over, calls.
GORDY
You okay?
Selena endures the pain.
Hides it behind iron eyes.
SELENA
Your hired soldiers can't shoot.

The village is a silent, smoking ruin. Everyone who
lived there is dead. Troops check the faces of the
bodies of the men against the freeze-frame of The Wolf
outside the Colombian consulate in New York.
The L.O.H. lands.
Brandt's met by the Ground Commander.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
310
GROUND COMMANDER
No sign of The Wolf. Two people,
possibly a third, got away.
They're in the river.
Brandt moves back to the L.O.H., gets in.
A moment
later, the chopper's up and away.
311
311
Gordy, Mauro and Selena are still floating, hanging onto
the cans, when they hear the sound of a HELICOPTER.
Gordy looks, sees the L.O.H. flying downstream ten feet
off the river.
GORDY
Under the water!
(to Mauro)
Uno, dos, tres...
He takes a big breath and holds it. Mauro understands
and does the same. They go under. So does Selena.
312
313
Gordy, Mauro and Selena surface, gasping for air.
314
315
The L.O.H. sweeps back in on the customs boats. ROCKETS
LAUNCH from the pods. One customs BOAT goes up in a
massive EXPLOSION. The other boat scoots.
109.
316
317
Gordy hears the L.O.H. again.
The three of them duck
again, and...
WHOOM! The CHOPPER ZIPS by just overhead. And continues
on. A moment later, Gordy, Mauro and Selena re-surface.
OFF them, as the copper recedes upriver...
318
318
Gordy and Selena float side-by-side, still holding onto
the cans. Mauro's asleep on Gordy's back, his arms
around Gordy's neck. Weakened by her wound, Selena keeps
bobbing below the surface. Gordy pulls her up.
GORDY
Hang on. We just have to keep
floating a little bit more...
Suddenly, in the growing light, Gordy sees Selena's blood
in the water and realizes she's wounded.
GORDY
You were shot.
SELENA
... I'm okay.
GORDY
We gotta get you outta the river.
319
GORDY
319
kicks them all to shore.
(CONTINUED)
110.

CONTINUED:
319
He climbs out of the river carrying Mauro. As Gordy
ascends the bank, Mauro wakes up, terrified. Gordy
tries to soothe him.
GORDY
Esta bien.
Esta bien.
But Mauro squirms free, and immediately, Mauro runs back
to his mother. Selena uses sign language to tell him
everything's okay. OFF Gordy's surprised look --
SELENA
He can't hear or speak.
Gordy just looks at them a moment. Then moves to Selena.
Re: Mauro, as Gordy examines her arm --
SELENA
He's a war orphan. I adopted him.
Beat.
Gordy finishes checking the bullet wound.
GORDY
You're lucky.
He uses part of his shirt to make a pressure bandage.
As
he ties it around Selena's arm, she looks around.
SELENA
I know where we are. There's a
secret trail nearby that leads
toward Mompos.
GORDY
Can you walk?
SELENA
It's just my arm.
Gordy admires this woman's bravery. Selena stands.
Mauro's clutching her skirt. Gordy looks at him.
GORDY
How do you say 'hello'?
Selena looks at Gordy a moment. She signs "hello" for
him, her seashells clacking as she does it.
Gordy taps Mauro to get his attention. Tries out the sign
for "hello." The boy just looks at him... then reaches
out and takes Gordy's hand, shows him the correct way to
do it. Gordy tries again. Mauro nods "yes" and smiles.
Gordy smiles back.
111.
320
320
Selena, Mauro and Gordy follow the secret trail, which
ends below a large waterfall. Gordy wonders what they do
now, when Selena keeps walking, suddenly disappears behind
the ROARING CASCADE. Beat. Gordy follows.
321
BEHIND WATERFALL
321
The trail continues, curtained by the falls. Gordy joins
Selena and Mauro. Mauro's excited by the experience of
being inside the waterfall. Gordy holds him, lets him
touch the sheet of water flowing past.
They walk to the other side of the waterfall.
Gordy
follows Selena and Mauro through.
322
322
Gordy emerges from the waterfall, and...
He's surrounded by Colombian soldiers with guns. More
soldiers point guns at Selena and Mauro. Gordy raises
his arms.
GORDY
Yo soy Americano... Gordy Pitt...
Gordy Pitt...
323
323
Claudio, The Wolf, rides into the capital from Dulles.
324
324
A Blackhawk lands in the clearing. The Colombian
soldiers escort Gordy, Selena and Mauro to the chopper.
The chopper door opens. Brandt's inside.
325
327
A Lear stops by a convoy of black government Suburbans
parked on the tarmac. FBI agents Joe Phipps and Reggie
Dray are among those waiting by the cars. The Lear's
door pops, and Gordy, carrying a sleeping Mauro, emerges
with Selena. Brandt and a medic follow.
328
329
The convoy slows outside the Latin American Institute.
An attached garage opens.
330
332
Claudio opens the door of a cheap rental garage in an old
commercial strip. He steps inside. There's a rental van
and a big Ducati motorbike against a wall. Claudio
straps a black bag onto the bike, then rolls it out and
shuts the garage. Pulls on helmet and STARTS the BIKE.
As Claudio speeds into traffic --
333
335
Security tightens all over the city.
Among the images we
see:
A forklift places huge planters -- really decorative
barricades -- to re-route traffic near vital buildings.
336
UNDERCOVER PEOPLE
336
with earpieces patrol public structures.
Some lead dogs
that sniff for explosives.
116.
336A
336A
Claudio weaves the Ducati through heavy traffic.
337
340
A man sits on a bench. He's wearing sunglasses and a
baseball cap. He puts a shoulder bag on the bench, takes
something out, then gets up and walks away, when...
Suddenly, two tourists and a hot dog vendor are right on
him. One of 'em jams a concealed gun jammed into his
ribs, while the other two hustle him forcefully to a van.
He's shoved inside. His bag's tossed in. The van drives
away.
341
353
Selena emerges with the two CIA agents.
354
ANGLE - DOWN BLOCK
354
Claudio sits on his parked motorcycle. He sees Selena
emerge. Drops his helmet visor and STARTS the BIKE.
121.
355
359
Selena and the agents cross the street toward the safe
house.
Claudio GUNS the BIKE toward them.
Selena hears the BIKE. Sees Claudio coming. Uses the
front edge of her hand to strike the female agent hard in
the throat. The agent falls to her knees trying to suck
air through a crushed windpipe. Selena whip-kicks the
other agent to the ground.
Claudio brakes hard next to Selena, who takes the female
agent's pistol and spare magazines as...
122.
360
GORDY
360
bursts outside, followed by Phipps et al.
Claudio OPENS FIRE with a MACHINE PISTOL, hitting two
agents and scattering Gordy, Phipps and the rest. Selena
SHOOTS the two escort people dead, then BLASTS away at
the other people pouring out of the institute as she
straddles the Ducati behind Claudio, and the powerful
BIKE SCREAMS off down the street.
Gordy jumps to his feet and runs after them.
361
361
BOOM! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION spits flame out of the windows
of the building's top floor.
362
PEOPLE
362
dive for cover.
Debris showers the street.
363
GORDY
363
keeps moving.
364
STREET IN FRONT OF INSTITUTE
364
runs one way in the direction the Ducati's headed. Far
down the block, the bike turns right onto another one-way
street.
365
GORDY
365
spots an alley on his right and turns into it.
366
366
Gordy's now moving parallel to Claudio and Selena,
sprinting hard toward another one-way street, which
crosses the alley ahead. He doesn't know if he'll
intercept the bike, but it's his only shot.
367
367
Claudio GUNS the BIKE down the second street, parallel to
Gordy's alley. He and Selena reach an intersection with
the one-way street. A right turn will complete the "U"
and take them back toward Gordy. Straight ahead, the
street they're on is one-way in the opposite direction.
Claudio hangs right and cranks on the speed.
123.
368
368
Gordy's almost to the next street. He can hear the WHINE
of the DUCATI growing closer. When...
A truck stops ahead of him and blocks the alley.
Gordy veers into a walkway between buildings.
369
369
A parked
car suddenly pulls out in front of the speeding
Ducati.
Claudio can't swerve around it. SLAMS ON the
BRAKES.
The car's driver, frightened and flustered by
the near
collision, is slow moving out of the way.
370
370
Gordy bursts through a gate. Sees back steps leading to
the open door of a second-story over a garage and charges
the steps.
371
371
The driver of the car finally backs up. Claudio aims the
DUCATI through a narrow gap and ZOOMS on.
372
373
The Ducati tears around traffic, when...
Gordy leaps out of the hayloft, launches himself off a
parked car as the DUCATI SCREAMS past, and...
He just manages to grab Selena and yank her off the bike.
Selena's arms are wrapped around Claudio -- when Gordy
rips her out of the saddle, Claudio goes, too. The three
of them tumble to the ground as the speeding Ducati
spins, flips and disintegrates.
124.
374
CLAUDIO
374
in leathers and a helmet. He takes the fall better than
Selena. Gets to his feet. Looks for the guns they
dropped. Before Claudio can get to a gun, Gordy's on
him. They grapple. Gordy pounds Claudio hard. Once.
Twice. When...
375
SELENA
375
side-kicks Gordy. He sags. She front-kicks a heel into
his spine and between his shoulder blades. Gordy lets go
of Claudio and drops. Selena's relentless, kicks Gordy
repeatedly as...
376
CLAUDIO
376
gets the pistol. Turns.
Aims the gun two-handed at
Gordy's head, and BANG!
377
DRAY
377
SHOOTS Claudio dead from the mouth of the alleyway down
the block. The first SHOT CRACKS the back of Claudio's
helmet. The second SHOT punches through and exits his
visor in a bright red mist of blood.
378
SELENA
378
bolts.
379
GORDY
379
goes after her.
380
DRAY
380
EMPTIES a CLIP at Selena, but he doesn't have a clear
shot and misses.
381
SELENA
381
sees a walkway between houses and turns in.
382
SAME SCENE - BEAT LATER
382
Gordy turns in behind her.
125.
383
383
Selena has ten yards on Gordy, but he's closing. She
knows she can't outrun him in a straight line. Jukes
through a gate into...
384
384
A shovel lies in the grass. Selena scoops it up and in
one motion, spins back toward the gate, launches it
blade-first with all her strength, timing it perfectly,
as Gordy runs through the gate, and...
385
GORDY
385
just barely evades the sharp shovel edge headed for his
face. It doesn't hurt him, but it stops him, and Selena
breaks toward an open door of the house.
386
395
The window Selena slipped through easily is small for
Gordy. He gets hung up on the glass, losing precious
seconds. Selena's already halfway up when Gordy hits the
fire escape steps.
The fire escape ends at a top floor window. Selena
BREAKS out the GLASS with the crowbar and goes in.
396
402
This is where the woman was gardening, tending a rooftop
flower bed. Selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs
to the next town house roof.
Gordy hits the roof behind her.
403
SELENA
403
As Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of
town houses, we see her warrior determination and
discipline. She's thinking ahead and she never
hesitates. Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally
well-trained and determined firefighter. And
he's not far back. One tumble, and he'll catch her.
Selena strains harder.
404
SELENA
404
vaults a gap.
Moments later, Gordy vaults it.
405
SELENA
405
finally runs out of roof. She looks down. A fire escape
ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard
of a small foreign embassy. Still holding the crowbar,
Selena takes the ladder down.
128.
405A
MOMENTS LATER
405A
Gordy reaches the ladder. Selena's ahead of him by a
floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. Gordy doesn't
fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the
roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands,
squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets
gravity take over.
406
406
The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony
running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin
staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where,
across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate
opens onto the street.
Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena. He
grabs her. Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm.
Gordy has to let go. Selena heads for the stairs leading
to the ground.
407
GORDY'S
407
got one chance to intercept Selena. The balcony's too
high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with
trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either.
Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife
and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a
living.
Gordy runs down the balcony. Gains speed. Jumps.
Launches off the balcony railing. And hurtles himself at
the trunk of a medium-sized tree. He hits the trunk.
Hangs on. And slides to the ground. And now...
408
ANOTHER ANGLE
408
He's between Selena and the only way out.
And there's no
way she's getting past him.
But that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with
the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of
the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can.
It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling
garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the
crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over,
the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard.
Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit.
It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg.
It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his
feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head.
(CONTINUED)
129.
408
CONTINUED:
408
Gordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all
dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and
then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy
stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate.
Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can
across the slate pavers, and...
The can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She
falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to
run, when...
Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a
brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm
around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks
backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing
whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's
not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have
to kill him before he'd let go.
Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around
Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller
woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till
she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of
the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do
is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the
courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped
with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses
in her ear --
GORDY
You killed them.
SELENA
(beat; with
contempt)
One woman, one boy -- they mean
nothing next to the thousands
who've been slain.
Gordy hears it.
It only drives him to a deeper fury.
GORDY
They were my family.
Gordy's blind with rage. Chokes her neck hard.
Summoning all the power in him, first to shut off her air
and blood, and then to continue squeezing, relishing her
every dying moment, until he's snuffed out the life of
the person who took Anne and Matt from him. And...
(CONTINUED)
130.
408
CONTINUED:
(2)
408
He can't... it's all he's wanted since he saw Anne and
Matt die, but now he can't do it. He's a firefighter.
He saves lives. If he kills Selena, Gordy crosses into
her world, into Brandt's world, into the brutal nightmare
destroying Colombia and all the places like it, and becomes
part of that sadness and death... And...
Gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe.
Selena gasps for air. The impulse to murder has left
Gordy. There's a new resolve...
GORDY
The killing ends here.
Beat.
Selena pants.
SELENA
It will never end.
409
NEW ANGLE
409
Under which an EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD emerges from the
building. He sees Gordy and Selena -- a large man
holding a smaller woman in a chokehold. Draws his gun.
EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
Let her go!
Gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun.
Selena screams.
SELENA
Please help me!
EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
Let her go!
GORDY
No.
You don't understand.
SELENA
He's trying to kill me!
EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
Let her go, or you're dead!
He's going to shoot. Gordy has no choice.
As he lets
Selena go and stands --
GORDY
Hold us both till the police get
here.
131.
410
ANOTHER ANGLE
410
It's too late. Selena stomps a heel into the Guard's
knee, crushing it, then twists the gun from his hands.
She points it at him and pulls the trigger, and...
In his agitation, the guard never took the safety off.
Selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety.
411
ANOTHER ANGLE
41
In the same moment, Gordy grabs the crowbar from the
ground.
412
SELENA
412
flicks off the safety and points the gun again.
413
GORDY
413
hurls the crowbar with all his might, and...
414
NEW ANGLE
414
The GUN FIRES, just as the crowbar hits Selena, spoiling
her aim. The bullet creases the guard's arm. Selena
recovers. And the next BULLET...
415
ANOTHER ANGLE
415
Isn't hers. It's from Phipps' GUN. It takes Selena in
the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way
through her body. She's dead on her feet. Her body
crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large
pool that quickly spreads over the slate.
416
OTHER AGENTS
416
move in to help the guard as Phipps holsters his pistol.
He walks to Gordy. The two men share a long, silent
look. It's over. Gordy looks again at Selena's body in
its pool of blood. Then turns and goes.
417
BRANDT'S
417
entering the courtyard as Gordy walks out.
Brandt's seen
Selena. He's smiling.
(CONTINUED)
132.
417
CONTINUED:
417
BRANDT
We got the bitch.
Gordy hits him. One of the jackhammer blows he slammed
into Claudio in the bunker. A hard fist deep in the gut
that drives all the wind from Brandt and drops him to his
knees. Beat. Gordy's voice is cold and hard --
GORDY
You're no better than she is.
And Gordy goes.
418
