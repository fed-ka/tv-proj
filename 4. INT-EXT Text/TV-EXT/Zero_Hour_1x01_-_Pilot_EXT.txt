marching in lock-step. Gargantuan Nazi standards above. IN

Moving through the sidewalk crowds: Priest & Colleague. With 
a nod to the torches the troops carry--a sea of angry flame--

back, and the rest of the market falls away; it s only the 2

And this moment is, well, a cinematic affirmation of that.  

Then, of course, his iPhone chirps. A text. He checks it.

Hank exits the building with Rachel, Arron, and Mickle.

something into his hand. An envelope. Inside, the diamond.

breath, looks to Rachel & Arron. It s go time.


Camera pans down from skyscrapers--a sea of windows--down to

Majestic castles, rolling verdant hills. Camera finds a 
rental car, winding its way up into the mountains. 


--guiding the car up a smaller road--


The car rolls to a stop in front of a dying chalet far from 
the rest of the world. Something very  survivalist  about it. 
Off the grid. A smoking old generator. Palette-loads of old 
canned goods. As Rachel & Arron climb out of the car--

ARRON

'Bavaria' in German.

The pontoon plane swooping into view. Nothing but a thousand 
miles of snow in one direction, a thousand miles of sea in 
the other. As the plane skirts the coast--


The Plane, landing in the shallows along the coast. Hank, 
Beck, & Pilot hop out on the skid. Survey the coastline.

Positive.

Camera swings around, reveals their vista: nothing but frozen 
tundra in every direction.

The only anomaly...a single low hillock, just on the edge of 
the water, windswept with snow...

Right then, a tiny palisade of snow collapses beneath his 
feet, calving away, revealing...black rusting steel.

They meet eyes. Hank kicks away more of the palisade. More 
steel becomes visible...10 feet of it, 20 feet...

Their eyes widen-- 

A massive rusting Nazi Swastika looks back at them. 

Hank & Beck begin frantically clearing the snow away--slowly 
revealing a vessel long lost to the world--

--a decaying, beached NAZI SUBMARINE.
