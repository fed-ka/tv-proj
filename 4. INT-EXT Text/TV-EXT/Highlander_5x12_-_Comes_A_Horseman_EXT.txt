      On a bleak hillside, the ruin of an ancient STONE TEMPLE
      stands testament to the grace of a vanished people.  Inhabited
      now only by bird-cries and the lonely wind that blows through
      it -- or so it seems.  Then, standing in the shadow of a
      ruined archway we see --

      A MAN, motionless as an effigy carved from stone, leaning
      silently on a wooden staff.  A sentinel.  Coarse robes
      proclaim him a member of some obscure Christian Order.  His
      ancient face, lined by the elements, is as severe as the
      stone he watches over.  He stirs alertly as a lone figure
      approaches him:

      A YOUNG ACOLYTE

      in the same robes, toiling toward him with a woven BASKET. 
      Reaching the old monk, the Acolyte bows respectfully.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    It's a long walk.

      The Monk motions him to follow.

                                    MONK
                    Toil is good for the soul.

      They move to another area of the temple, where they reach --

      A WELL

      set into the stone.  Mossy with age, the opening is blocked
      by an ancient, heavily built GRATING of thick metal bars. 
      There is a small space in them, but a massive metal BOLT
      ensures the grate will never open.  Beyond the grate, a black
      recess stretches deep into the earth.

      The Monk nods to the Acolyte.  The lad lifts the basket,
      filled with grapes, a few figs, some bread -- but he hesitates
      it seems such a waste of good food.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    I thought it was a sin to waste food.

                                    MONK
                    It is only a waste to you.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    2.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1101CONTINUED:1101

      The Monk motions him severely to continue.  The Acolyte shrugs
      and carries out a ritual: keeping his distance, he carefully
      dumps the contents of the basket through the grate, into the
      well.  The food drops into the darkness.

      Finished, the Acolyte collects the basket and they move away
      from the well.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    And why watch an empty pile of rocks? 
                    It's been sealed for centuries.

                                    MONK
                          (curt)
                    Is there no end to it?
                          (beat)
                    It was sealed for a good reason.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    By pagans.

      The Monk grabs his arm, glares at him.

                                    MONK
                    We do not question the rules of the
                    Order!  We obey them, as we have
                    obeyed them since the beginning!
                          (beat)
                    The ancients were pagans, but they
                    were not fools.

      He grabs the empty basket and limps away.

      The Acolyte shakes his head, bemused, and settles down to
      stand his watch.  He takes a cluster of grapes from his robe,
      but as he begins to eat them -- he hears a sound.

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          (very faint)
                    Help...

      The Acolyte pauses, doubting his ears -- was it a voice, or
      just the wind?  Then it comes again.

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Please... someone help me.

      The Acolyte is certain now: it's the voice of a child.  He
      scans the ruins, looking for the source.

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Please help me.  It's dark!

      No doubt now: it's coming from INSIDE the well.  The Acolyte
      moves toward it, eyes wide in disbelief.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    3.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    I fell... I think my leg is broken.

      The voice is pitiful, a frightened child in distress.  The
      Acolyte wavers, recalling the monk's warning -- but this is
      a child.  He tugs at the heavy grate, but the massive BOLT
      won't budge.

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                          (a whimper)
                    Help me, please, I'm afraid!

      Crying now.  Pitiful, wracking sobs.  More determined than
      ever, the Acolyte picks up a large rock from the ground and
      strikes at the bolt.  Once... twice... on the third blow it
      comes loose.  The Acolyte drops the rock and shoves the bolt
      free.

      He lifts the heavy grate and shoves it aside, then stretches
      his hand down into the darkness.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    Reach up... take my hand!

      He waits for the child's hand to grasp his -- then his
      expression changes.  The hand that grips his is hard,
      muscular, with a grip like steel.

      The Acolyte struggles to pull free, but he's dragged
        relentlessly towards the opening.  His head thumps into the
      side of the well.  The Acolyte stumbles back, sprawls to the
      ground.

      ON THE ACOLYTE

      lying in the dirt, dazed.  He looks up to see --

      ACOLYTE'S POV

      the creature that struck him: it is a man.  Big, dirty, with
      wild matted hair, a naked back: this is KRONOS, entombed for
      a thousand years and he looks like it.

      Kronos gazes down at the Acolyte and smiles at his fear and
      confusion.  He moves his lips oddly and a voice comes out:

                                      KRONOS
                          (a child's voice,
                            mocking)
                    Help me, please... I'm afraid!

      The child's voice, coming from this huge, frightening face. 
      The Acolyte crosses himself in fear.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    God protect me!

      Kronos reaches down, hauls the Acolyte to his feet.

                                      KRONOS
                    What gods do you call on, boy?

                                      ACOLYTE
                    Our Holy Savior... the King of Kings.

      Kronos thinks a BEAT, searching his memory.

                                      KRONOS
                    Never heard of him.

      He lifts the Acolyte and tosses him down a nearby hill.

      Kronos flexes his arms, enjoying the feel of muscles long
      disused, like a pianist warming up after a long absence.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    It's good to be back.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A sign reading: WHEEL OF HISTORY - CONTESTANT TRYOUTS

      BELOW this, a line of waiting FANS stretches along a cordon
      at the studio entrance.  Methos steps from the door, MacLeod
      at his side.  Methos looks perky.  MacLeod definitely doesn't.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't believe you did that.

                                      METHOS
                          (lightly)
                    C'mon, MacLeod, the guy handed me a
                    ticket.
                          (beat)
                    It was a selfless act in the interest
                    of historical accuracy.

      The crowd sees Methos and breaks into applause.  Methos
      pauses, smiling, to give a little bow and a wave.

                                      MACLEOD
                    An oversized ego wouldn't have
                    anything to do with it.

                                      METHOS
                    I think they love me.

      MacLeod pulls him away from the crowd.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's a game show.  They'd love a
                      hammerhead shark if it had a nice
                    smile.

                                      METHOS
                    They asked me back.  What do you
                    think?

                                      MACLEOD
                    One word.
                          (beat)
                    Animal.  Four legs, carries heavy
                    weights.

                    Very funny, MacLeod.

      And OFF THIS they turn a corner.

      as they turn down a deserted street.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What if someone recognized you?

                                      METHOS
                    Not likely.  Besides, I never went
                    on to the finals.

                                      MACLEOD

                          (pointed)
                    Tom Jones did not popularize the
                    twist.

                                      METHOS
                    So I'm a little weak on pop culture. 
                    I mean, who the hell is Chubby Checker
                    in the grand scheme of things?
                          (beat)
                    I know how tall Nero was, and Caesar's
                    favorite food.  I know that Helen of
                    Troy didn't have much of a face, and
                    it only launched a hundred ships. 
                    And Jefferson never...

                                      MACLEOD
                          (interrupting him)
                    Blah, blah, blah.

      The conversation ends abruptly as they get the BUZZ.  They
      stop and look at each other, suddenly serious.

                                      METHOS
                    Expecting anyone?

      MacLeod shakes his head.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe it's your fan club.

      Methos looks worried.

                    There's another way back.  It's
                    longer, but I prefer the view.

      He starts to turn away, but MacLeod doesn't move.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Send me a postcard.

                                      METHOS
                    You're not coming?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I like to know who's around.

                                      METHOS
                    Maybe I don't know Chubby Checker,
                    but I know when to disappear.
                          (beat)
                    Good luck.

      He moves off.  MacLeod continues alone down the street.  The
      BUZZ growing stronger.

      NEW ANGLE

      as MacLeod passes an alley.  The BUZZ is stronger.  Then he
      catches a brief sight of an Immortal at the end of the
      alleyway coming toward him, the same one from the TEASER,
      but he has cleaned up considerably: short hair, black clothes,
      a long jacket.  It is a glimpse obscurred by steam coming
      from a manhole cover.

      As MacLeod stares into the steam, it becomes:

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Through the SMOKE from a smoldering wagon, five horsemen can
      be seen approaching at a hard gallop.

      They arrive at a wooden BUCKBOARD, or what's left of it: the
      wagon is turned on its side, scorched and still smoking. 
      The result of a vicious attack.

      The riders are TEXAS RANGERS MacLeod is working with, hard-
      faced men wearing long coats.  They are serious, cold-eyed,
      somber.  TIPPET, the leader; PAXTON, two others.

      MacLeod dismounts and moves around the smoldering ruins. 
      Clothes, household items are strewn around -- the rig has
      been ransacked.

                    It was Koren, all right.  He and his
                      Comancheros left their mark.

      MacLeod's face darkens as he lifts something from the ground:
      it's a soot-covered CHILD'S DOLL.  MacLeod kneels and examines
      the ground, then looks up.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    We're about two hours behind 'em.

                                      TIPPET
                    How many with him?

                    I make it six, plus the horses they
                    stole.

      He motions toward the horizon.

                    Didn't even bother to hide their
                    tracks.  They headed straight for
                    Laredo.

                                      TIPPET

      He lifts the DOLL he's still holding, looks at it.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    We'll just have to prove they're
                    wrong.

      He lays the doll gently on the buckboard, and mounts up. 
      Tippet shakes his head at the bodies.

                                      TIPPET
                    Hate to leave these poor souls like
                    this.

                    We'll come back.  Let God watch over
                    them for now.
                          (beat)
                    If we don't stop Koren, there'll be
                    a lot more bodies to bury.

      They spur their horses and ride off.


      MacLeod and three of the Rangers are at one end of town,
      their horses tied, waiting.  Tippet smokes a thin cigar,
      looks speculatively at MacLeod.

                                      TIPPET
                    You're quite a tracker, MacLeod. 
                    You been in the military?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I've done my time.

      Tippet draws on his cigar.

                                      TIPPET
                    They say Melvin Koren's been shot,
                      stabbed... some claim he was even
                    lynched, but I find that hard to
                    credit.
                          (beat)
                    His Comancheros call him El Gato,
                    the Cat.  Say he's got nine lives.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just one, like everyone else.
                          (beat)
                    And he can lose it.

      The fourth Ranger, Paxton, scuttles back to them.

                                      PAXTON
                    Other end of town.  Near the corral.

      MacLeod pulls his gun, spins the chamber.

                                      TIPPET
                    Hope you shoot as well as you can
                    track.

      They check their pistols, slide shotguns and rifles from
        saddle-scabbards, all in grim silence.

                                      TIPPET (CONT'D)
                    Show no mercy and expect none,
                      gentlemen.

      They turn and move slowly down the street.

      ANGLE - THE SIDEWALK

      Townspeople start dispersing, expecting trouble.

      THE RANGERS

      fan out across the street, rifles ready, eyeing rooftops and
      doorways as they walk.

      As they round a jog in the main street ahead of them they
      see --

      THE CORRAL

      and five of the COMANCHEROS there, celebrating.  A mongrel
      mix of Indian, Mexican, white -- they're dirty, brutal, and
      swaggering.  Some wear ponchos, items of Indian clothing,
      bandoleers crisscross their shoulders.  One of the Comancheros
      waves the dead woman's parasol as he swigs from a whiskey
      bottle.

                                      TIPPET
                      Afternoon.

      The Comancheros see the Rangers and react.  They fan out,
        belligerent, hands roving near their guns.

      MacLeod gets the BUZZ.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Steady.  There's another one
                      somewhere.

      From a nearby storefront MELVIN KOREN emerges.  Dressed a
      cut above his gang, he's Kronos, the Immortal from the TEASER. 
      He wears two pistols stuck in his belt, a large bowie knife
      in a scabbard, a scraggly beard.  His eyes rove over the
      Rangers, stop on MacLeod.  Each knows what the other is.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS
                    Look who we have here.  The famous
                    Texas Rangers.

      He looks at MacLeod.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    And they brought a friend.

                                      TIPPET
                    Melvin Koren, I'm obliged to place
                    you and these men under arrest for
                    murder.

      Koren grins.

                    Then what?  A judge in fancy robes? 
                    A lawyer in a nice suit?

                    Maybe just a rope and a funeral.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS

                    I like it fine right here.  Saloons,

                    No, I think we'll stay put.

      The Comancheros take the cue, ready themselves.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Either way, Koren.  On your feet, or
                    on your back... but you're finished.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS
                    I think you came a long way to die.

      He suddenly draws both pistols.  In a moment, everyone is
      shooting.  (PLEASE NOTE: It is important for the European
      Version that this be shot stylistically.  Fingers on
      triggers... Horses hooves stumbling about... On men's faces,
      etc.  The fewer bullet hits seen on camera, the better.)
      They're at close quarters -- fifteen to twenty feet apart. 
      The Comancheros blast wildly, missing many shots.  The Rangers
      fire in a measured way, taking aim.

      Ranger, Neville, fires his shotgun --

      COMANCHERO

      flies ass over tea-kettle back into the corral fence.

      The Comanchero with the parasol is shooting wildly at MacLeod. 
      MacLeod takes careful aim -- blows him down.

      KOREN fires, hits Neville in the thigh.  Neville goes to his
      knees, but keeps firing.  The gunfire is deliberate,
      continuous -- if men are breathing, they are shooting.

      Another Comanchero falls.

      Koren starts backing off, firing both pistols, a Comanchero
      beside him.  The gunfire is constant, confusing.  PAXTON
      goes down, wounded.

      Koren turns and slips into the STABLE.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    12.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1104CONTINUED: (3)1104

      MacLeod shoots a last Comanchero -- and suddenly there is
      silence.  Smoke everywhere, bodies strewn around.

      Two Rangers are down, one standing wounded, several sprawled
        Comancheros, one still moving.

      The remaining Rangers re-group, and Tippet moves to help the
      wounded Paxton.  As he does --

      MacLeod slips into the stable after Koren.


      A bleak, windswept cemetery.  The crosses are simple wooden
      affairs, hastily erected.  This is an outlaw's burial place,
      and no loving hand lingered over these crude markers or laid
      flowers here.

      We see older CROSSES with scrawled messages on them:

      LYLE LEVITT: CARD CHEETER AND THIEF.

      HENRY BLAGGET: GOAT DEFILER.

      CHIP MORGAN: JUST TOO SLOW.  Then, stopping on a newly erected
      cross:

      MELVIN KOREN.  1867.  BETTER THAN HE DESERVED.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    14.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1106CONTINUED:1106

      And below the cross, an EMPTY GRAVE.  Koren has dug himself
      out of the shallow hole and escaped.

      MacLeod picks up the cross and looks at it, jaw twitching
      with his frustration for Koren's escape.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Next time.

      He tosses the cross aside, and walks away.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Koren smiles at MacLeod.  He turns and slips away.  MacLeod
      draws his sword and goes after him.  He reaches the corner --

      Koren is gone.  MacLeod follows, moving warily along the
      street, past storefronts, cars, along deserted streets.  He
      catches sight of Koren, moving ahead of him.  Finally Koren
      ducks into an abandoned building.

      Spread out in the sand, a scattering of goat-skin tents,
      women and children of the tribe with their animals. 
      (CASSANDRA DESCRIBES IN V.O.)

                                      CASSANDRA (V.O.)
                    It was before science or reason. 
                    When there was a young world waiting
                    to be discovered and understood...
                    or feared.
                          (beat)
                    Life was hard.  A sickness, a broken
                    bone could mean death.  The greatest
                    gift was the skill to heal.

      ANGLE - A TENT

      larger than the others.  We hear a brief YELP of pain.


      An injured TRIBESMAN watches fearfully as Cassandra,
      wildhaired and beautiful, applies a poultice to his arm, as
      her mentor, HIJAD, tall, aging, the tribal healer, looks on.

                                      CASSANDRA (V.O.)
                    Hijad was our Tribe's Healer.  He
                    had found me as a baby, and taken me
                    in as his student.
                          (beat)
                    I wasn't yet Immortal, but I had
                    skills, and Hijad trusted me.  Maybe
                    he could sense I was different.

      (NOTE: when Cassandra speaks in this FLASHBACK, she does not
      have a British accent).

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    The pain will leave you soon.  But
                    do not use the arm until I tell you.

      The man moves to rise -- Hijad stops him.  He takes the man's
      hand, then waves his other hand slowly over the poultice,
      muttering an incantation under his breath.  The action has
      an eerie, mystical quality.

      During this, Cassandra stares at Hijad in surprise.

                                      CASSANDRA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Hijad schooled me in the healing
                    arts until I knew all his secrets.
                          (beat)
                    Or I thought I did.

      Hijad finishes, releases the man's arm.  The Tribesman smiles
      gratefully, then leaves the tent.

      Cassandra turns to Hijad, rebuffed by his actions.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Did I make the medicine badly?

                                      HIJAD
                    You made it perfectly.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Then why did you make magic over
                    him?

                                      HIJAD
                    There is more to healing than herbs.
                          (beat)
                    He believes the spell will help. 
                    So, it will help.
                          (beat)
                    Do not worry... you will learn.

      Hijad sets aside some of the pouches.

                                      HIJAD
                    And one day you will pass my simple
                    skills... Then you will be the Healer.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (objecting)
                    But you will always be here.

      Hijad reaches out, tenderly touches her cheek.

                    Not always.


      Far from the tents, a NOMAD walks the dunes, collecting a
      bundle of DRIED WOOD for the fires.  As he bends to pick up
      a branch -- he pauses at a distant sound.  As he listens, it
      grows louder, until it is clear: HOOVES thundering along the
      sand.

      ANGLE - HORSES HOOVES

      at a full gallop as they chew up the sand.

      THE NOMAD

      looks worried.  He turns, quickly scans the horizon -- and
      freezes in fear.  Coming straight at him --

      THE HORSEMEN

      four MOUNTED WARRIORS are bearing down on him at a FULL
      GALLOP, bodies covered with plates of leather armor, marked
      with METAL SPIKES; heads covered by hideously carved FRIGHT
      MASKS, individual, highly stylized.

      Three of them wield bronze SWORDS of various shapes, the
      fourth carries a huge bronze AXE.  They look elemental, as
      if mounted demons had descended to earth.

      For a BEAT the Nomad is frozen, then fear pushes him into
      action.  He turns with a cry and tries to run.

      THE HORSEMEN

      are bearing down on him.

      THE NOMAD

      runs for his life, but the Horsemen are too fast.  As they
      gallop past, a SWORD flashes -- the Nomad tumbles into a
      lifeless heap in the sand.

      The Horsemen continue at a FULL GALLOP, not slowing their
      pace a bit.


      Cassandra mixing herbs as Hijad looks on.

                    Hijad told them I was a gift from
                    the desert... and one did not refuse
                    such gifts.  He saw things that others
                    could not see.
                          (beat)
                    He could not foresee what was to
                    happen.

      As they work, there is an eruption of SCREAMS.  Cassandra
      and Hijad drop what they are doing and race toward them.


      As Cassandra and Hijad come around their tent to find a sight
      of pandemonium:

      The HORSEMEN have hit the camp.  (NOTE: For the Foreign
      Version, please shoot the following stylistically.  On horses
      and faces, showing as little carnage as possible.)  People
      run, women grab children, men try to resist with knives. 
      The Horsemen are fighting machines, people falling, scattering
      for their lives.

                                      HIJAD
                    STOP!

      The Leader of the Horsemen sees Hijad.  He raises his arms --
      and the other Horsemen pause in the slaughter.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What are they?

                                      HIJAD
                          (stunned)
                    The Horsemen.

      Cassandra's eyes widen in fear as the leader rides slowly
      towards them.

                                      CASSANDRA (V.O.)
                    Everyone knew of the Four Horsemen. 
                    The destroyers.  The ones who lay
                    waste.
                          (beat)
                    Across the world we knew, people
                    lived in terror of them.  Where they
                    rode, whole villages were destroyed...
                    or simply vanished.  They were without
                    mercy, without fear.

      The Leader spurs his horse toward Hijad.  His mask makes him
      seem a god, or a devil, and his voice booms from inside it,
      oddly distorted.

      Hijad gathers his courage and steps forward.

                                      HIJAD
                    We have nothing you want!

                    No, wait!

      Cassandra turns to the tent, quickly drags out a worked METAL
      CASKET.  She throws it before Kronos.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)

                    This is all we have, I swear!

      Kronos raises his mask.  Under it, his face is weirdly painted --
      it is as frightening as the mask.

                                      KRONOS
                    Then kill them.
                          (beat)
                    Kill them all.

      Kronos lowers his mask and spurs his horse towards Hijad.

      Cassandra steps in his path, screaming, raises her arms to
      stop him -- but Kronos swings, and she is the first to die.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      the smoke that rises from the smoldering remains of the tents.

      A modernistic structure, kind of Frank Lloyd Wright in metal
      and glass.  Methos is approaching his 4-wheel-drive vehicle,
      looking tight-lipped.  He's concerned about MacLeod and the
      unknown Immortal.  He stops as he gets the BUZZ.  He reacts
      in relief, starts to turn around.

                                      METHOS
                    MacLeod!  I was starting to worry --

      SCHWING.  He's cut off in mid-sentence, eyes wide in shock. 
      He looks down to see --

      A DAGGER BLADE sunk deep into his chest, right over his heart.

      Kronos, a few feet away.  He smiles at the look on Methos'
      face as his failing heart struggles to beat.

                                      KRONOS
                      Greetings, brother.

      Methos tries to shake his head -- this can't really be
      happening.

                                      METHOS
                          (a whisper)

      Then he slumps against the van, dead.

      As he pulls the dagger from the chest of the dead Methos.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      The Horsemen's camp.  FOUR TENTS, each fronting a pole with
      flying cloth COLORS on it.  Strung on one pole is a brace of
      HUMAN SKULLS.  Before the tents, plunder from various raids
      is laid out.  One or two captive SLAVES work over a fire.

      A bundled CARPET is dragged from the back of a horse, flopped
      on the ground.  Hands grip the rim of the carpet, pull hard. 
      The carpet unrolls, and CASSANDRA, clothing torn, sprawls
      out.  She pushes shakily to her knees to see --

      A masked HORSEMAN gazing at her.  His mask is hammered metal,
      a work of stylized cruelty.

                                      HORSEMAN
                    You'll live.
                          (beat)
                    Your type is very hard to kill.

      He offers a hand to draw her up -- suddenly she lunges at
      him, a dagger in her hand.  The Horseman catches her arm,
      twists with practiced efficiency, and disarms her.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    31.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1122CONTINUED:1122

      He raises his mask -- it is METHOS.  Not the Methos we're
      used to: this man is cold, without compassion or humor.  His
      face is painted half-blue, giving it a barbaric look.

                                      METHOS
                    You'll have to do better than that.

      Cassandra struggles in his grasp.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Where are they?  My people, my tribe,
                    Hijad... take me to them!

      Methos looks puzzled, as if she's asked an odd question.

                                      METHOS
                    You want to see them?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Yes!

                                      METHOS
                          (shrugs)
                    If you like.

      He waves toward Caspian's tent.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Caspian keeps the heads.  He thinks
                    it makes him smarter.
                          (frowns)
                    So far it hasn't worked.

      Cassandra stares in horror.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You killed them?  All of them?!

                                      METHOS
                    Including you.

      He indicates the blood on her robe.  Cassandra stares at it,
      grief drowned in wonder as she feels her side.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    The wound.

                    It's gone.  I should be dead.

      She looks at him in wonder.

                                      METHOS
                    You live because I want it.

      He slides his hand along her leg.  She slaps him hard he
      instantly cuffs her back, sends her reeling.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    That did not please me.

      Again he runs his hand along her leg.  This time she flinches,
      but doesn't resist.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                          (approving)
                    Maybe you're clever enough to stay
                    alive after all.

                    I am Methos.  And you live to serve
                    me.  Never forget that.

      He smiles for the first time.  As she cringes back --

                                      SILAS (O.S.)
                    It's mine.  It belongs to me!

      ANGLE - SILAS' TENT

      As Caspian and Silas spill out of it, each holding the end
      of a beautifully embroidered cloak.

                                      CASPIAN
                    It belongs to whoever can take it!

      Methos shoves Cassandra down on the carpet, and moves to the
      other two.

      NEW ANGLE

      as Methos approaches Silas is quiet, stolid.  Caspian has
      the mercurial temper of a psychopath.

                                      SILAS
                    I saw it first.

                                      CASPIAN
                    I fought as well as you!  I killed
                    more people!

                    Women and children don't count.

      Caspian whips out his blade and has it to Silas's throat in
      a second.

                    I can kill you just as well.

      Silas says nothing.

      CASSANDRA

      sees Methos' HORSE standing nearby.  She starts edging toward
      it.

      RESUME SCENE

      As Methos reaches Silas and Caspian.  He edges around the
      two.

                                      METHOS
                    Lay it down, Caspian.

                                      CASPIAN
                    Why should I?

      Methos whips out his sword with blinding speed, puts it to
      Caspian's neck.

                                      METHOS
                    Because if you don't, I'll kill you.
                          (beat)
                    Look at me, Caspian, and believe. 
                    If I have to lose someone, I'll lose
                    you.

      Caspian sees he's serious.  Slowly he lowers his sword, as
      Kronos steps up.

                                      KRONOS
                    Problems?

                                      METHOS
                    Not any more.

                                      KRONOS
                    There's one way to make sure.
                          (beat)
                    Lift it.

      Caspian and Silas lift the cloak between them.  Kronos draws
      his sword -- swings -- and cuts the cape in half.  He gives
      them a hard look.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    We share.  Everything.

      They hear a sound --

      CASSANDRA

      is on Methos' horse, trying to ride past them.  She can barely
      stay on.

      Methos sees her.  He races after her, and as the horse passes,
      he lunges at her and throws her to the ground.  She tries to
      rise, but he pushes her back, puts a knife to her throat.

                                      METHOS
                    You died once today.  Did you enjoy
                    the feeling?

      Cassandra shakes her head.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Then remember this well.  I will
                    kill you as often as it takes to
                    tame you.

      He raises his knife for a painful object lesson.  As the
      blade falls --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      Methos is packing his van, tossing in laundry bags full of
      clothes, a satchel, preparing to leave in a hurry.  He gets
      the BUZZ, turns as --

      MACLEOD'S T-BIRD

      screeches to a stop near him.  MacLeod hops out and
      approaches.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Going somewhere?

      Methos turns, heaves more items into the van.  His face is
      tight.

                                      METHOS
                    You shouldn't be here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What are you running from?  The
                    question or the answer?

                                      METHOS
                    There is no answer.

                    Leave it be, MacLeod.

      He turns to the van, but MacLeod spins him around to face
      him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Is what she said true?

                                      METHOS
                    I'm out of here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not yet, you're not.
                          (hard)
                    Is it true, or isn't it?

      Methos throws down a satchel in frustration.

                                      METHOS
                    Dammit, they were different times! 
                    I was different... the whole bloody
                    WORLD was different!

                                      MACLEOD
                    DID YOU KILL THOSE PEOPLE!

      Methos finally snaps, turns and HAMMERS the mirror of the
      van, snaps it off.

                                      METHOS
                    Killing was all I knew.  Yes!
                          (beat)
                    Is that what you wanted to hear?

      MacLeod looks at him a long beat.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's enough.

      He starts to turn away, but Methos stops him.

                                      METHOS
                    No, it isn't enough!
                          (beat)
                    I killed, MacLeod.  But not just
                    fifty... not a hundred...
                          (beat)
                    I killed a thousand.  Ten thousand! 
                    And I was GOOD at it!
                          (beat)
                    And it wasn't because of vengeance. 
                    It wasn't because of greed.  It was
                    because I LOVED IT.

      Now that he's started, it comes out like an eruption.

                                      METHOS
                    Cassandra was nothing.  Her village
                    was nothing.
                          (beat)
                    You want to know who I was?
                          (beat)
                    I was Death in a mask.  When mothers
                    told their children the monster would
                    get them, I was that monster!  I was
                    the nightmare that kept them awake
                    at night!  Is that what you wanted
                    to hear?!

      He finally winds down.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    The answer is yes.  Oh, yes.

      MacLeod doesn't answer for a moment.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Leave.  Now.  Just get in and go. 
                    We're done.

      He turns and walks back to his car.  And OFF Methos' face,
      watching him --


                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    You can't defend what he did.  Stop
                    trying.


      Methos carries Cassandra onto the walkway of the bridge, and
      props her on it, just as she wakes up.  She starts to
      struggle, but he twists her arm behind her.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You should have killed me when you
                    had a chance.

      Methos doesn't answer.

      He shoves.  Cassandra sails off the bridge and plummets down
      into the water.


      Methos stands by the building wall, which has a sheet of
      FLAMES licking up the side.  He holds the open JERRY CAN he
      used to start the fire and to make the Molotov cocktail.  He
      considers the flames a BEAT.

                                      METHOS
                    What the hell.

      He tosses the can onto the flames for good measure, then
      turns to the wall, and yanks a FIRE ALARM there.  The ALARM
      blares out a shrill scream.

      He turns and leaves.


      Methos stands there, stock still, a sword to his neck.  It's
      held by a furious Kronos.

                                      KRONOS
                    You stopped the fight... you saved
                    MacLeod!

                                      METHOS
                    It could have gone either way.  I
                    couldn't take the chance.

                                      KRONOS
                    Of me losing?  Or MacLeod?
                          (beat)
                    Maybe I was wrong.  Maybe I'll just
                    kill you anyway and make sure.

      He brings back his sword.

                                      METHOS
                    You do that, and you'll never have
                    the Four Horsemen.

                                      KRONOS
                          (beat)
                    What are you saying?

                                      METHOS
                      Caspian... Silas... They're alive.

      Kronos wavers a beat.

                                      KRONOS
                    You're lying.

      He puts the sword to Methos neck.

                                      METHOS
                    It's true.  I can take you to them!

      Kronos searches his face, believes him.  He lowers his sword,
      his eyes lighting up with a searing intensity.

                                      KRONOS
                    Then you live.
                          (beat)
                    The Four Horsemen ride again.

      And OFF his look --

                                                                              FADE OUT.
