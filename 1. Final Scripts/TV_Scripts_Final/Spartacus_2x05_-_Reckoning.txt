  FADE IN:


  INT. PANTRY/MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  MOVE WITH a pair of feet as they descend the pantry stairs. 
  REVEAL MELITTA as she selects wine from the storage rack. A 
  HAND reaches in from the shadows, touching her cheek. She 
  whirls in surprise as GANNICUS emerges from the shadows.

                                          MELITTA
                                  hushed, worried)(
                        How did you get beyond the gate?

                                        GANNICUS
                      It is a weak thing, against such 
                        strong purpose...

  He gently brushes a rogue lock of hair from her eyes. Her 
  heart quickens.

                                          MELITTA
                        You risk discovery.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I would risk everything. For you.

  The air between them thickens with desire. Melitta vainly 
  attempts to resist it.

                                          MELITTA
                      We cannot do this.

                                        GANNICUS
                        No. We cannot...

  He kisses her, his actions belying his words. Melitta s 
  protest is swept away as she passionately devours him. His 
  hand slides up her dress. She gasps as he enters her.

  MELITTA SMILES,

  an expression of pure ecstasy. This is what she has wanted. 
  What she has denied herself.

  BLOOD SUDDENLY SPLATTERS

  her in the face, shattering the moment. Melitta stares in 
  horror at the BLADE OF A SWORD sticking through Gannicus  
  throat. He gurgles in surprise, collapsing to REVEAL




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  behind him. Deadly sword clutched in hand. Tears of rage and 
  hurt sting his eyes.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You fucking whore.

  Oenomaus REARS HIS SWORD BACK and with a violent wrath 
  BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN --


  INT. MELITTA S QUARTERS - BATIATUS  VILLA - MORNING

  Melitta slams awake. NAEVIA is at her side.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Domina summons you.

  Melitta nods, her heart pounding -- and mind racing over the 
  dream. And the betrayal of her unconscious desires. OFF HER 
  DISTRESS as she rises, WIPING US TO --


  INT. GAIA S BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - MORNING

  LUCRETIA sits on the edge of the bed, Gaia s RED WIG cradled 
  in her hands. Lost and alone in her grief. A long beat, 
  finally broken by Melitta entering. Naevia follows.

                                          MELITTA
                        Apologies. I did not hear you 
                        calling.

  Lucretia stares at her for a moment, not really hearing.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Collect Gaia s belongings. Titus 
                        would have them removed.

  Melitta and Naevia comply, carefully placing Gaia s things 
  into her trunks. Melitta gauges Lucretia s pain, struggles 
  to find words to ease it.

                                          MELITTA
                        I know how close you held her. It 
                        was an unfortunate accident.

  Lucretia stiffens. The word accident a sore subject. She 
  knows Gaia was murdered by Tullius (in Ep. HB4), but has 
  been ordered by Titus to cover it up.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                        She was taken from us too soon.

                                          MELITTA
                        Yet blessed to count you as friend, 
                        while she was among us.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        She was more than friend. She was 
                        family.
                                  a beat, soft)(
                        Titus orders her slave removed. And 
                        commands salt and spelt be 
                        scattered. Decision and ritual, to 
                        cleanse all trace of Gaia from 
                        beneath his roof.

  Her eyes drift to Gaia s wig in her hands.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I asked Quintus to speak to his 
                        father. To not let Gaia be so 
                        easily swept from memory. But a 
                        wife s desires do not always mirror 
                        the wishes of her husband.

  This lands with Melitta, whose recent desires are most 
  certainly at odds with those of Oenomaus.

                                          MELITTA
                                  soft)(
                        Then she must keep them hidden.

  Lucretia looks to Melitta, not understanding.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                      We will tell them ritual was 
                        performed, even in absence of the 
                        deed. Naevia and Diona to attest, 
                      if questioned.

  Lucretia is deeply touched by the gesture.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gratitude.

  OFF LUCRETIA, eyes clouding with tears...

                                        BATIATUS (PRE-LAP)
                        I am assaulted on all fronts!                                                                                    4.


  EXT. MARKET - CAPUA - DAY

  BATIATUS and SOLONIUS move through the sparsely populated 
  streets. The ROAR OF A CROWD audible in the b.g.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  hissed)(
                        Tullius spills blood in our own 
                        fucking house, yet my father 
                        condemns innocent son!

  A FLASH of guilt seizes Solonius. Unbeknownst to Batiatus, 
  he was the one that informed Tullius of Petronius  party at 
  the villa (in Ep. HB4).

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The blame is mine.
                                  quickly, covering)(
                      If I had only stayed a while 
                        longer...

                                        BATIATUS
                        You might have joined Gaia in 
                        untimely end. No. The fault rests 
                        with Tullius alone.

  The crowd ROARS in the distance. Batiatus tightens.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Listen to them. Cheering the final 
                        games of the old arena. Yet here we 
                        stand. As removed from them as Gaia 
                        from this world. Courtesy again of 
                        fucking Tullius.

  Solonius squirms, needing to broach uncomfortable subject.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      It appears I will be making 
                        appearance after all.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You gain invitation to the games?

                                        SOLONIUS

                        A minor position, the effort far 
                        exceeding the reward.

  A tense beat. Batiatus smiles, warmly grasping his friend s 
  shoulder.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It stirs heart, to know you 
                        unscathed from association with me.

                                        SOLONIUS

                                  subject)
                        Petronius seemed quite pleased with 
                        your offerings. Perhaps there is 
                        still opportunity for you to gain 
                        placement in the opening games of 
                        the new arena.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fuck the new arena. Fuck Tullius, 
                        fuck the fucking gods! None of it 
                        fucking matters now.
                                  soft, pained)(
                      My father gives ultimatum. Lucretia 
                        must no longer hold title of wife.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  shocked)(
                        Titus dissolves your marriage?

                                        BATIATUS
                        That would be a kindness. He 
                        demands I dissolve it. Or find 
                        myself put to street with her.

  Solonius takes that in, his own blossoming interest in 
  Lucretia getting the better of him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Then perhaps it best... if she were 
                      to find another husband.

                        I would fucking sever cock from 
                        body, than see her from my arms.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would hold the same at first, in 
                        your position. Yet it would crumble 
                      to simple reason: If you still 
                        intend to run the ludus, what other 
                        choice remains?

  OFF BATIATUS, feeling the sting of truth in Solonius  
  words...                                                                                    6.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  GLADIATORS train in the early day s sun. GNAEUS snares a 
  palus with his net, gaining in skill.

  CRIXUS AND BARCA

  spar. Crixus manages to topple Barca. Barca laughs in 
  surprise. Crixus extends a hand to help him up. Barca takes 
  it with a grin, their friendship growing.

  ASHUR AND DAGAN

  pass by, trading blows. Dagan is on the offensive, angrily 
  pummeling Ashur. Driving him back before finally KNOCKING 
  Ashur off his feet. Ashur lands hard near RHASKOS and 
  DURATIUS as they spar.

                                          RHASKOS

                        presented your ass to a Roman for 
                        rough pleasure.

  Ashur glares at the reference to what he did to Dagan at 
  Petronius  affair. Spits in contempt as he rises.

                                        ASHUR
                        You speak of piss.

                        dull wit can be honed, he will 
                        prove asset.

  Oenomaus  attention is pulled away by Gannicus appearing 
  from the Infirmary. Wounds still fresh from his fight with 
  Tullius (in Ep. HB4).

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Gannicus. Work the palus, if you 
                        are able.

  Gannicus nods, heads for the palus. The guilt of his illicit 
  kiss with Melitta (HB4) hangs heavy as he passes Oenomaus. 
  Titus fumes at the sight of Gannicus  condition.

  Titus nods, grasping Oenomaus  shoulder warmly as he moves 
  off. Oenomaus CRACKS his whip, gaining the men s attention.

  The men pause in their training. OFF OENOMAUS, his eyes 
  hardening to the task he has been given...                                                                                    9.


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Gaia s BODY SLAVE is led out of the villa in chains, passing 
  DIONA as she attends to the daily cleaning. Eyes distant. 
  Being used as a sex slave draining the life from her. Naevia 
  glances over from where she toils. Searching for the words 
  to bring her friend comfort.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Diona --

  Titus interrupts as he passes.

                        Where is Lucretia?

                        Leave her where she is. You may 
                        answer question. Has salt and spelt 
                        been scattered?

                                        NAEVIA

                        Yes, Dominus. We have swept it from

  Titus nods with a frown.

                                        TITUS
                        A step towards proper path.

  Titus exits. Diona grumbles bitterly.

                                        DIONA
                        Should have let the bitch tell her 
                        own lies.

                        Diona. Lower voice.

  Diona turns on Naevia. Rage and hate in her eyes.

                                        DIONA
                      So now you command me? Will you 
                        decide who fucks me as well?

                        Friendship is a privilege. One not 
                        deserving of a whore.

  Diona exits. OFF NAEVIA S DEVASTATION....


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  MUSIC SWELLS as we MONTAGE through several fights of the 
  gladiator ranking competition. Oenomaus circles with whip in 
  hand. Titus watches from the balcony as:

  BARCA

  battles Ashur. Ashur presses an assault. Barca counters, 
  cracking Ashur in the face with his practice spear. Ashur s 
  BLOOD FLIES and CAMERA REVERSES TO

  GANNICUS

  as blood SPLATTERS his cheek. He battles Rhaskos, who is on 
  the defensive. Gannicus SWINGS his practice swords, sending 
  Rhaskos crashing back. As he hits the ground we see it is 
  now

  AMBIORIX,

  a burly gladiator being attacked by Dagan. Ambiorix rolls to 
  his feet. Dagan brutally dismantles him, sending him back to 
  the ground in an

  EXPLOSION OF SAND

  that TRANSITIONS us to Crixus battling NICOMEDES, a lean 
  Greek who fights with a long shield and wooden gladius. 
  Crixus seems at ease, his confidence growing as he deflects 
  Nicomedes  assault with a grin. The men CHEER them on.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.
  CONTINUED:

  ANGLE ON THE PANTRY

  as Melitta retrieves an amphora of wine. She glances at 
  Oenomaus across the square, who is unaware of her presence. 
  Her eyes drift to Gannicus, watching the fight from the back 
  of the throng. Her gaze lingers, her dream still fresh.

  GANNICUS

  senses her gaze, turning to lock eyes. He offers a hesitant 
  smile. Melitta STARTLES, quickly turning away to move back 
  upstairs. Gannicus longingly watches her go.

  THE ROAR OF THE MEN

  pull his attention back to the fight as Crixus hammers 
  Nicomedes to the ground. Nicomedes throws up the missio, 
  bloodied and beaten. The men BELLOW. Oenomaus CRACKS his 
  whip.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Gnaeus! Pollux! Take position!

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus steps from the villa, surprised by the activity.

                                        BATIATUS
                        What is this?

                      My decision still to be given 
                        voice, yet you proceed as if I am 
                        already absent.

                                        TITUS
                        This house must be turned to order, 
                        regardless of whether you happen 
                        upon your senses.

                        A word that should lift a man, 
                        filling his life with ease and 
                        children. She gives you neither.

                        and expect gratitude it no longer 
                        beats.

                                        TITUS
                        I seek only to call you son, absent 
                        shame in the title.

  Batiatus is stung by this remark. Hurt by the truth of it.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  soft)(
                        And I only ever wished to make you 
                        proud, father.

  And it s out there. Batiatus laid bare. Titus  own anger 
  gives way to painful regret, the gulf between them ever 
  widening. He turns back to the contest, unable to find words 
  to bridge the gap.

                                        TITUS
                        The rankings will be decided at 
                        contest s end, two days hence. I 
                        will grant you equal time to prove 
                        you have moved beyond past 
                        transgressions. Dissolve your 
                        marriage... or call me father no 
                        more.

  OFF the ultimatum...

  Fuck.  The oxygen sucks out of the room.  Batiatus instantly 
  regrets his words.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I speak without thinking.

  Lucretia exits with Melitta, devastated.

                        Lucretia --

  She s gone.  OFF BATIATUS, his world crumbling...


  INT. OENOMAUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Oenomaus stirs from sleep, awakened by the flickering of 
  candles at the altar.  Melitta is kneeling before it, 
  pouring an offering of SPICE from her hands as she prays.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The gods call you from our bed

                                          MELITTA
                        I seek their guidance.  Return to 
                        sleep.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  warmly)(
                        I would only dream of you.

  She forces a smile in reply, guilt welling.

                                          MELITTA
                      My own are filled with troubling 
                        image.  The walls alive with 
                        secrets, condemning those privy to 
                        them.

  Oenomaus rises to comfort her, misunderstanding.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      We have borne witness to 
                        unfortunate events, removed from 
                        our hands.  Yet this is an 
                        honorable house.  One of deep 
                        history.  The gods must surely 
                        remember this.

  Melitta sees the fierce loyalty in Oenomaus  eyes.

                                          MELITTA
                        You truly love this place.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

                      My life held no meaning before I 
                        was brought here.  This house is 
                        the foundation upon which I was 
                        built.

                                          MELITTA
                        I feel nothing but the weight of 
                        its beams.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The burdens placed upon us often 
                        overwhelm.  But it remains our duty 
                      to bear them.

  Melitta looks in his eyes -- if you only knew.  Oenomaus 
  kisses her.  Gently takes her hand.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Come.  Let us pray, and together 
                        see weight lifted.

  As the two bow their heads, we PUSH IN on the candle, its 
  flame MORPHING INTO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  -- THE BLAZING SUN scorches the CHEERING MEN as Gnaeus 
  battles Ashur.  Gnaeus SLINGS HIS NET, entangling Ashur.  
  KICKS him to the ground, trident at his throat.  Ashur gives 
  the missio.  The men CHEER.

                                        GNAEUS
                        Perhaps I should throw the tadpole 
                        back.

  The Gladiators ERUPT in laughter.  Ashur glares, but there s 
  a good bit of humiliation and worry behind his anger as he 
  untangles himself.  The contest is not going well for him.

  THE BALCONY

  Titus and Batiatus gaze down at the men.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Gnaeus continues to gain in skill 
                      as Retiarius.  Soon he will ignite 
                        the crowd, as I promised.

  Titus GRUNTS, barely acknowledging the comment.  Batiatus 
  tightens, starts to reply.  Lucretia appears with Melitta, 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.
  CONTINUED:

    interrupting the thought.  Melitta carries a simple amphora 
  of honeyed wine.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Apologies for the hour of my 
                        rising.  Sleep came with difficulty 
                        last night.

  She casts a cool look at Batiatus.  Batiatus tenses, unsure 
  of what she will say in front of his father.  Titus ignores 
  them both, his eyes instead on Crixus and Duratius as they 
  finish gearing up to face each other.

                                        TITUS
                        Your absence was not noticed.

  Lucretia forces a smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Yet the apology stands.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  quickly)(
                        A noble gesture, well appreciated.

  Titus glances at her, cool to the sentiment.  His eyes fall 
  on the amphora of wine.

                                        TITUS
                        The mulsum more so.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Let me fill your cup.

  Lucretia takes the amphora and pours.  Batiatus relaxes.  
  She s taking his advice in plying Titus with kindness.  
  Oenomaus announces the next pairing in the square below.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Duratius!  Crixus!  Take position!

  Duratius and Crixus move to comply.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus appears of a form, does he 
                        not?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Begin!

  Crixus attacks.  A deadly show of grace and speed.  Lucretia 
  hands Titus his cup.  Titus nods, drinks.  Lucretia eyes 
  Crixus as he fights.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                        One that Gaia favored from first 
                        sight.

  Titus darkens upon mention of Gaia.  Naevia appears before 
  he can reply.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Apologies.  Tullius arrives.

                        See him to my office.

  Naevia exits.  Lucretia barely contains her outrage.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What is that man doing in our 
                        house?

                      My house.  And he comes in response 
                      to invitation.

  Titus exits, giving no further explanation.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Tullius should be hurled from 
                        fucking cliff.  Yet instead my 
                        father takes knee to swallow cock.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And you do nothing to stop him.  
                        Save lay blame where none should 
                        rest.

  Batiatus  anger turns to guilt over his words last night.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I am a fool in such regard.  
                        Allowing frustration to strip 
                        tongue of sense.

                        Everything spins from fucking 
                        control.

  The pressure of Batiatus  impossible situation crushes down 
  on him.  He stares out at Crixus battling Duratius.  Lost.  
  Lucretia sees this, softens.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You desire a son of your own.  To

                        I would do anything to give you 
                        such a treasure.

  Batiatus looks at his wife.  Loves her so fucking much in 
  this moment.  Which makes what he has to say all the more 
  painful.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I must give him my decision 
                        tomorrow.  It is too late for such 
                        dreams.

  Crixus lays out Duratius down below.  The men ROAR.  Crixus 
  throws his arms up, his confidence rising quickly to the 
  levels of season 1.  Lucretia smiles at the victory.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It is never too late.  When will is 
                        set to purpose.

  Lucretia s meaning is clear: we must do what it takes to rid 
  ourselves of Titus.  OFF BATIATUS, the pressure 
    increasing...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  TIGHT ON AN ORNATE AMPHORA OF MULSUM, carried by powerful, 
  calloused hands.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S.)

                        mulsum.

  WIDEN TO REVEAL TULLIUS.  He takes the amphora from his 
  bodyguard THERON and hands it to Titus.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

  Titus takes the amphora with a tight smile.

  A cough takes hold, quickly passes.

                                          TULLIUS
                        A simple gesture.  To smooth edge 
                        from jagged events.

                                        TITUS
                        Jagged?  A woman is dead, Tullius.  
                        A Roman woman, in my house.  You go 
                        too far.

  Tullius stares, ominously silent.  No one talks to him like 
  this.  A tense beat.  Then very calmly...

                                          TULLIUS
                        I have come to make amends.  With a 
                        gift.

                        I offer position.  In the opening 
                        games of the new arena.

  Titus reacts in surprise.  And suspicion.

                                        TITUS
                        Why would you do this?

                        the House of Batiatus over the 
                        years.  Hadrianus.  Magnetius.  
                        Oenomaus.  Countless others, forged

                        one.  The storied victories of your 
                        men were part of the old arena as 
                        much as its wood and its sand.  Yet 
                        its final day passed absent the 
                        House of Batiatus.  An unforgivable 
                        tragedy.  Caused by the actions of 
                        a foolish son.

                                        TITUS
                      He knows my mind towards this 
                        regard.  Yet his actions do not 
                        stand alone in deserving 
                          condemnation.

                                          TULLIUS
                        The past cannot be changed.  Let us 
                        turn eye towards horizon of glories 
                        untold.  Ones to share in together.

  Titus gauges Tullius carefully.

                                        TITUS
                        And what is it you seek in return 
                        for such generosity?

                                          TULLIUS
                        The only thing I have ever sought.  
                        Gannicus.

  A beat as Titus absorbs that.

                                        TITUS
                      My son believes the man a champion.  
                        Above all others.

  Tullius clocks Titus  reticence.  Smiles warmly.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You are a reasonable man, Titus.  
                        You always have been.
                                (the hint of a 
                                  threat)
                        All I ask is that you consider what 
                      is best for your house.  Enjoy the 
                        wine.

  Tullius exits.  OFF TITUS, considering the amphora of 
  mulsum.  And the devil s bargain that accompanies the 
  gift...                                                                                    21.


  INT. HALLWAY/GAIA S BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Naevia hurries down the hallway, searching for something.  
  She spots her quarry in Gaia s bedchamber:  Diona, her back 
  to CAMERA among Gaia s packed belongings, sitting on the 
  edge of the bed.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Domina calls for food and wine.
                                  gets no reaction)(
                        Diona?

  Diona turns, wiping tears from her face as she nods.  The 
  sight of her friend in such a state is a knife in Naevia s 
  heart.

                                          NAEVIA(cont'd)
                        Pause a moment, if you need.  I 
                        will say I could not find you.

  She turns to go.

                                        DIONA
                        Naevia...?  My words.  I did not 
                        mean them.

                                        NAEVIA
                                  soft)(
                        I know.

                                        DIONA
                        Your friendship... your love...  It 
                      is constant reminder of what I have 
                        lost.

  Naevia takes a seat beside Diona.  Tender.

                                        NAEVIA
                        I am still here.  And will forever 
                        be.

  Diona loses it.  Begins to SOB.  Naevia holds her.

                                        DIONA
                        Those men... what I have done with 
                        them...

                                        NAEVIA
                        You did only as commanded.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    22.

                        I pray to the gods every night.  
                        That the next man I am forced to 
                        lie with takes my life...

  Naevia holds her friend tight, wanting more than anything to 
  shield her from the pain of the world.  OFF the shattered 
  life...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  TIME SLOWS as a SPEAR stabs towards camera.  REVERSE TO FIND 
  Gannicus, bending out of the way, the tip narrowly missing 
  his face.  RAMP TO REAL SPEED as Gannicus straightens and 
  attacks Barca, his twin practice swords slicing the air.

  ANGLE ON ASHUR

  as he cautiously sidles up to Dagan, who stands watching the 
  match with Rhaskos and Ambiorix.

                                        ASHUR
                                in Aramaic)(

                        each other in the next match, my 
                        brother.]

  Dagan ignores him.  Ashur licks his lips, clearly worried as 
  he whispers to Dagan.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

                        rankings.  I fear the mines, if I 
                      do not gain better showing.]

  Dagan spits, his eyes never leaving the match.  Ashur s 
  worry increases.  The men CHEER as

  GANNICUS AND BARCA

  trade thunderous blows.  Gannicus  focus is momentarily 
  pulled away by



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.
  CONTINUED:

  MELITTA

  attending Batiatus and Lucretia on the balcony.  She locks 
  eyes with Gannicus for a frozen moment.  Filled with longing 
  and pain.

  WHAM!

  Barca cracks Gannicus in the face with his shield.  Gannicus 
  spits blood, eyes flashing murder.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You lumbering shit!

  Gannicus attacks, his swords hammering Barca.  Gannicus 
  dismantles the big man, sends him crashing to the sand.  
  Gannicus raises one of his swords to bash his skull in.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Gannicus!

  Gannicus whirls to face Oenomaus.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                                  calmly)(
                        You are the victor.

  Gannicus regains control.  Barca rises with a grin.

                                        BARCA
                        I nearly had you.

                        Nearly.

  He glances up to the balcony.  But Melitta refuses to look 
  at him.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Dagan.  Ashur.  Take position.

  Dagan grins darkly.  Ashur realizes he s fucked.

                                        ASHUR

  Dagan says nothing as he takes position.  Ashur grips his 
  sword, tensely waiting for the command to --

  Ashur attacks, hammering Dagan.  Dagan is driven back.  
  Ashur presses, hope swelling.  It is quickly dashed as Dagan 
  counters.  He pounds Ashur, delivering a brutal beating.

                                        DAGAN

                        fucked.]

  THE BALCONY

  Titus enters from the villa.  Batiatus greets him with 
  barely concealed hostility over Tullius  visit.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Good Tullius has taken leave?

                                        TITUS
                      He has.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And what has he carried from our 
                        house this time?

  Titus greets that with a frown, Tullius  offer weighing 
  heavy on his thoughts.  The CHEERS of the men grant him 
    distraction, pulling his eyes to

  DAGAN

  as he dismantles Ashur.  A devastating blow sends Ashur to 
  his knees, blood dripping from his battered face.  Dagan 
  moves in to finish him off.  Ashur looks up, eyes pleading.

                                        ASHUR
                                in Aramaic)(

                      me to end this on my feet...]

  Dagan looks at his helpless companion before him... and 
  softens.  With a subtle NOD, he gives Ashur the go-ahead.  
  Ashur suddenly surges up, catching Dagan in the face with 
  his shield.  Dagan staggers.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

  ASHUR SWINGS HIS PRACTICE SWORD

  with all his might.  It slams into Dagan s face, RIPPING 
  OPEN HIS EYE in a spray of blood and gore.

  DAGAN SCREAMS

  in agony, collapsing to the sand, clutching his ruined 
  socket.  Ashur throws his arms up in triumph, shouting to 
  the stunned spectators.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

  Titus calls down to Oenomaus and the men.

                        Rest, and tend wounds.  Tomorrow 
                        bring send of contest.  And 
                        appropriate reckoning.

  Titus turns, heading back into --


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Batiatus follows.  Naevia and Diona set out food in the 
  background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would have words.

                      As would I.  Accompany me to town, 
                        and let us break them.

  Titus moves off.  Batiatus glances back to Lucretia.  Holds 
  her gaze for a moment.  He nods, setting his will to the 
  deadly purpose she spoke of as he exits.  Lucretia watches 
  him go.  A beat as she considers her next move.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Melitta.  Once they have departed, 
                        there is something I would ask of 
                        you.

  OFF LUCRETIA, her eyes setting in grim determination...                                                                                    26.


  INT. PANTRY/MESS HALL - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  The rising moon hangs low, casting deep shadows.  FIND 
  MELITTA waiting inside the pantry at the gate.  A beat.  She 
  shifts nervously, peering out into the gloom.

                                        GANNICUS (O.S.)
                        I have felt your eyes.  Lingering.

  She starts as Gannicus emerges from the darkness on the 
  other side of the gate.  Melitta guiltily avoids his gaze.  
  Gannicus smiles sadly at the action.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Yet they always turn away when I 
                        meet them.

                                          MELITTA
                      As should yours.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Then I must tear them out.  It is 
                        the only way they will obey such 
                        command.

  Melitta looks up, unable to resist meeting his eyes.  They 
  are filled with pain and longing.

                                          MELITTA

                                        GANNICUS
                      As if they were my own.  You move 
                      to erase the moment between us.  
                        When we embraced, and pretense fell 
                        away.

                        I have vowed to, a thousand times a 
                        day.  To return to drink and 
                        whores, forcing you from mind.

                        Then I catch glimpse of you.  And 
                        the world ends.

  His hand touches hers through the bars.  An electric beat.

                                          MELITTA
                                (soft, filled with 
                                  regret)
                        I have never felt greater love... 
                        than when I hold my husband in my 
                        arms.

  Gannicus  heart seizes.  Melitta pulls her hand away as a 
  GUARD approaches with Crixus, unlocking  the gate.  Melitta 
  and the Guard usher Crixus upstairs.  Gannicus watches her 
  go, his heart breaking.

                                        OENOMAUS (O.S.)
                        What fucking seizes you?

  Gannicus tenses, shocked to see Oenomaus approaching.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You drop guard, allowing Barca 
                        advantage.  The man almost had you.

  Gannicus realizes this isn t about Melitta.  He takes him in 
  with guilt and regret.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I lost myself for a moment.  Taken 
                      by a dream.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Wake from it.

  Gannicus smiles sadly, the pain of a love he will never know 
  a fist in his chest.

                                        GANNICUS
                      As all fools must.

  He moves off into the darkness, WIPING US TO --


  INT. GUEST BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Melitta escorts Crixus in.  His eyes dart nervously to 
  Lucretia.  [NOTE: She is in her dress from scene 14.  No 
  sheer gown, no sexy sexy.]  She eyes him, equally nervous.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

                        Leave us.

  Melitta sees Lucretia s anxiety.  Hesitates.  Do you really 
  want to do this?  Lucretia nods.  Melitta exits.  A tense 
  beat as Lucretia steels herself.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        You are a Gaul, are you not?

                        Yes, Domina.

  Lucretia begins to circle him.  Inspecting.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Many believe the seed of a Gaul to 
                        rival that of Jupiter himself.  
                        Tell me.  How many sons sprang from 
                        your father s cock?

                                        CRIXUS
                        Five.

                        And his father before him?

  Crixus starts to get a very bad feeling about this.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The same.

  Lucretia stops circling.  That was the answer she needed.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Your subligaria.  Remove it.

  Crixus hesitantly removes his subligaria.  Lucretia glances 
  down OFF SCREEN at his cock.  There is no smile.  No hint of 
  the lust from season one.  Only trepidation and revulsion.  
  She pushes it aside, locking eyes with him.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        You are never to speak of this.

  Crixus just stands there.  Not sure what he s gotten himself 
  into, but knows it s trouble.

  A tense beat.

                        I would not look upon you.  The 
                        sight turns stomach.

  She turns away, bending over the bed and lifting her dress.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)

                        you have spilled seed.

  Crixus reluctantly moves to her.

  ON LUCRETIA,

  flinching as he enters her.  SLOW PUSH IN on her face, her 
  eyes filling with tears that she has been brought to this...


  EXT. OLD ARENA - NIGHT

  CAMERA slowly sweeps the empty stands.  Sections of wood and 
  railing have been torn away by rowdy fans seeking souvenirs 
  before the arena is torn down.  Debris litters the sand.

                                        TITUS (O.S.)
                      My very first memories were formed 
                        within this arena.

  SWING AROUND to REVEAL Titus taking in this relic of glories 
  past.  Batiatus follows a few paces behind.

                                        TITUS
                        Attending the games as a child, 
                        upon my father s knee.  Too young 
                      to yet form words.

  Titus takes a handful of sand.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Yet I knew even then.  That I would 
                        give my life to this place.

  He lets the sand drift through his fingers.  Feeling how 
  easily it is lost.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A noble calling.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                        in.

  Batiatus processes that.  Picks up a scrap of wood the rough 
  size of a club.  Considers it.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  soft)(
                        Was I not raised here as well?

                        You were.

  Titus smiles at the memory.  It is short lived.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        I fear it is the only thing we hold 
                        common now.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And you stand me at fault.  As you 
                        always have.

  Batiatus  grip tightens on the scrap of wood.  Just the 
  right heft to bash a man s skull in....

                                        TITUS

                        I stand you accountable for your 
                        actions.

  Titus is racked by a fit of coughing, gets control of it.  A 
  beat as his anger gives way to weary sadness.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        You have caused me much heartache.  
                        Never heeding my words. Fighting me 
                      at every turn, your ambition the 
                        bolt hurled against my wishes.  And 
                        here is where it has led.

  He turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  Unable to face 
  his son.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Two men at constant odds.  Mired in 
                        the ruins of what might have been.

  Batiatus darkens, steeling his courage to what must be done.  
  For Lucretia.  For himself.  He slowly advances on Titus  


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                        them buried.

  Titus turns back to face him.  Batiatus tenses, well within 
  striking distance.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)

  Batiatus wavers.  This is not what he was expecting.

  Titus turns to go.  Batiatus wrestles with himself, comes to 
  a decision.

  Titus pauses.  Batiatus advances with the wood scrap -- and 
  hands it to him.

  Batiatus walks out.  OFF TITUS, small and alone...


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGH

  SLOW PUSH IN ON Lucretia, sitting in the bath.  Alone.  No 
  slaves.  The water DRIPS as her mind processes what she s 
  done.  What it has cost her.

  BATIATUS

  appears, lost in his own troubled thoughts.  Pulling 
  Lucretia from hers.  An expectant beat.

                        the moment came...
                                  a beat)(
                      He spoke to me with affection.  
                        Giving voice to sentiment...

  He bites back the tears, overwhelmed as he wades into the 
  water.

                        I was wrong to push you to such 
                        thoughts against him.
                                  thinking of Crixus)(
                        Some actions carry too steep a 
                        price.

                        Even in refraining, the ground 
                        beneath us pitches.
                                  a beat)(

                        The only one my tongue could ever 
                        speak.

  Lucretia is deeply moved.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You honor me.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  bitterly)(
                        I attempt to gain the sun, only to 
                        plunge into the depths. While 
                        Tullius rides with Apollo, bribing 
                        his way with an amphora of mulsum 
                        and promises to the air.

  Lucretia gently bathes him.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It does not matter.

  The anger drains out of him, leaving an empty shell.

  She gently kisses him, taking him into her arms.  He clings 
  to her, desperately attempting to resist being dragged under 
  by conspiring fate.  OFF THE MOMENT...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - MORNING

  Titus enters with Oenomaus at his side.  Titus looks tired 
  and drained.  The emotion of recent events taking its toll 
  on his health.

                                        TITUS
                        The men have fought with passion 
                        and honor.  A testament to your 
                        work as doctore.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I but carry torch lit by more 
                        deserving predecessor.

                                        TITUS
                      He would have been proud.  This 
                        house has seen many champions, 
                        Oenomaus.  Yet you stand tallest 
                        among them.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  clearly touched)(
                        I have not the words, Dominus.

  Titus laughs.  It quickly turns into a brief fit of 
  coughing.

                                        TITUS
                        Those who do tend to weave them to 
                        undeserved advantage.  Where do we 
                        stand upon the rankings?

  Oenomaus hands over a list.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.
  CONTINUED:

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Eight men have yet to hold victory.  
                        And one suffers grievous injury.

                                        TITUS
                                  eyeing list)(
                      It pains to lose Dagan.  The Syrian 
                        had shown much promise.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        More so than Ashur.  Yet Dagan is 
                        now blind to attack from the right.  
                          A disadvantage in the arena.

  Melitta enters, bringing food and wine.  Pours.

                                        TITUS
                        Let us shift from the unfortunate 
                      to the blessed.  Who holds the 
                        pinnacle?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Two men own equal victory.  Crixus 
                        and Gannicus.  They are to face 
                        each other in the final --

  Titus waves that away.

                                        TITUS
                        Gannicus is removed from 
                        contention.  I have sent word to 
                        Tullius agreeing to terms of sale.

  Melitta reacts in surprise.  Oenomaus glances at her, 
  sharing the feeling.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Tullius?

                                        TITUS
                      He makes offer.  I had thoughts 
                        towards refusal, but they have 
                        dimmed.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I would speak towards reigniting 
                        them.

                                        TITUS
                        Now you find words?  Quintus has 
                        plied me with many upon the 
                        subject.  He inflates Gannicus  
                        worth, at great cost to this house.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.
  CONTINUED:

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Apologies, but in this your son and 
                        I are in agreement.  None stand 
                        more worthy of the title of 
                        champion.

                                        TITUS
                        You allow personal relation to 
                        cloud judgement.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        True, Gannicus is trusted friend.

  Melitta shifts uncomfortably.  Oenomaus doesn t notice.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Yet I speak from position of 
                        doctore.  One but a moment ago you 
                        sought to praise.

  Titus considers that with a sour frown, knowing he s right.

                                        TITUS
                      If I pull acceptance to Tullius, we 
                        will be excluded from future games.  
                      We would be forced to beg for 
                        matches in the lesser venues of 
                        Nola or Neapolis.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        A heavy price.  As is often that of 
                        the honorable choice.

  A long beat as Titus carefully weighs Oenomaus  words.

                                        TITUS
                        Let the gods show us the way then.  
                      If Gannicus proves himself against 
                        Crixus, he shall remain.  Yet if he 
                        falls, he shall leave this house.  
                        Following the others that have 
                        failed to honor it.

  OFF TITUS  COMMAND...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The sun hangs low.  Storm clouds have marshaled in the 
  distance.  The men have gathered for the final contest of 
  the day.  Oenomaus consults with Gannicus before it begins.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.
  CONTINUED:

                                        GANNICUS
                                  stunned)(
                        I am to be sold to Tullius?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Only if you fall.  Clear mind.  And 
                        prove yourself the man I know you 
                      to be.

                                        TITUS
                        Doctore.

  Oenomaus looks to the balcony where Titus stands.  Naevia 
  attends in the background.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Let us begin.  And know who truly 
                        stands champion of this house.

  His eyes fall on Gannicus with a frown.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Crixus.  Gannicus.  Take position.

  Gannicus moves to comply, meeting Crixus in the center of 
  the square.  Crixus  eyes blaze with determination.

                                        CRIXUS
                        A second chance to prove myself 
                        against you.  The gods have heard 
                      my prayers.

                                        GANNICUS
                        And curse you in the answering.

  Gannicus  eyes go hard and cold, knowing his fate hangs in 
  the balance of this match.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Begin!

  Gannicus and Crixus clash together.  Gannicus is surprised 
  to find Crixus much improved since their match before Varus 
  (Ep. 2).  They battle it out, each landing blows.

  BATIATUS

  steps out onto the balcony with Lucretia.  Lucretia wears 
  Gaia s red wig for the first time.  A final act of defiance.  
  Melitta and Naevia attend.  Titus does not notice them, his 
  attention fixed on the fight.  Batiatus eyes him, 
  conflicting emotions roiling.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                        Father.  We near ready to leave.

  Titus does not turn around, yet his heart is clearly 
  troubled.

                        Pause a moment.  And see contest 
                        ended.

  A small spasm of COUGHING seizes him.  Batiatus hesitates, 
  looking to Lucretia.  She nods in acceptance.

                                        LUCRETIA

  Naevia exits.  Batiatus joins his father at the railing, 
  looking down at the fight.  A beat.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus again shows form.

                      As does Gannicus.  Both men you 
                        have often praised.

                        Perhaps you have learned something 
                        after all these years.

  Batiatus smiles sadly at that.

                        Perhaps.

  Crixus unleashes a furious volley down below.  Melitta 
  wincesas Gannicus gets hammered.  Lucretia eyes Crixus with 
  mixed feelings of revulsion and fascination.

  GANNICUS COUNTERS,

  assaulting Crixus with lightning fast blows.  Crixus takes a 
  blow to the face, sending BLOOD flying.  Crixus staggers 
  back -- and grins.  Is that the best you got?  The men CHEER 
  as he attacks, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    39.


  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  The SOUND of the CHEERING MEN echo faintly from outside.  
  Naevia appears, pulling Diona in her wake.

                      No one  will notice your absence 
                        for many hours.

  Diona wrenches her arm away, fear flashing in her eyes.

                                        DIONA
                        They will brand me fugitivus!

                        They will not find you.

  She produces a small purse of coins, presses them into 
  Diona s hands.

                        Buy passage far from Capua.  And 
                        the things that have been done to 
                        you.

                        Spirited from Gaia s things.  They 
                        will not be missed.

  Diona wavers, tears welling.  Naevia barely holds it 
  together

  Diona embraces Naevia, hot tears wetting her cheeks.

                                        DIONA
                        I will see you again, one day.  I

                        Go.

  Diona gives Naevia one last smile, then turns and hurries 
  out.  Naevia watches her go, heartbroken at losing her but 
  welling with hope that Diona will find a better life.  OFF 
  THE MOMENT...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNSET

  Crixus CHARGES Gannicus.  TIME SLOWS as Gannicus SWINGS his 
  practice swords to meet the attack.  Crixus SLIDES beneath 
  the arcing blades, SHOWERING the camera in a SPRAY of SAND.

  RAMP BACK TO NORMAL SPEED,

  as Crixus slams Gannicus in the back of the knees with his 
  practice sword, collapsing him to the ground.

  OENOMAUS TENSES,

  aware of the fight s stakes and sensing that Gannicus has 
  his hands full.

  CRIXUS RISES

  and attacks, narrowly missing Gannicus who ROLLS AWAY just 
  in time.  Gannicus surges to his feet.  The two trade bone-
  jarring blows.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus can t help but be taken by the display, despite his 
  current situation.

  Titus smiles sadly, a COUGH building.

  Melitta pours a cup, hands it to Titus.

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Gannicus catches sight of Melitta on the balcony.  They lock 
  eyes, both filled with pain and regret.  And once again she 
  turns away.

  CRIXUS SEIZES THE MOMENT

  and attacks.  Gannicus narrowly counters.  But there s 
  something different about him.  A spark that has been 
  dimmed, threatening to fade altogether.  As Crixus presses, 
  Gannicus FLASHES TO --


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Gannicus and Melitta forced to make love (Ep. 2, Sc. 27 - 
  already shot).  Both of them unexpectedly swept away in the 
  moment.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - SUNSET

  Crixus hammers Gannicus.  Gannicus is driven back under the 
  assault as he FLASHES TO --


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Gannicus is bloodied and beaten from his  exhibition  match 
  with Tullius (Ep. 4, Sc. 18 - already shot).  He pulls 
  Melitta into a kiss.  The world stops.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNSET

  Gannicus counters Crixus  attack, but it is halfhearted.  
  Oenomaus tenses, not liking where this is going.

  THE BALCONY

  Melitta s eyes are pulled to Gannicus, concern blooming in 
  her eyes.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

  Crixus continues to press.  Gannicus counters, FLASHING BACK 
  TO --


  INT. PANTRY/MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  From scene 15 of this episode.  Gannicus  hand is on 
  Melitta s through the gate.  She pulls away, turning away 
  from him.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNSET

  TIGHT ON GANNICUS, his eyes filling with pain and loss as he 
  defends against Crixus  onslaught.  He comes to a decision 
  -- he is going to lose.  Gannicus subtly lowers his defenses 
  just enough to give Crixus an opening.

  RAMP TO SLOW-MO

  as Crixus swings around, his shield slamming into Gannicus  
  face.  Blood flies as Gannicus is lifted from his feet and 
  slams to the ground.  RESUME NORMAL SPEED as Crixus pounces, 
  positioning his sword to Gannicus  throat.  A tense beat.  
  Broken by Gannicus raising the missio.

  THE GLADIATORS

  erupt, stunned by the display.  Melitta s heart sinks.  As 
  does Oenomaus  as he s forced to announce --

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Crixus, victor.

  The men CHEER for Crixus as he offers hand to Gannicus.  
  Crixus hisses as he helps him up, eyes narrowing in 
  suspicion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Why did you drop guard?

                                        GANNICUS
                        You are champion now.  That is all 
                        that matters.

  Gannicus turns and heads towards his cell.  Crixus watches 
  him go, his victory ringing hollow.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus is absolutely stunned that Gannicus has lost.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

  Batiatus just manages to catch Titus as he collapses.

  Melitta hustles out.  Batiatus holds his father, not knowing 
  what to do.  Lucretia stands in the background, her face 
    unreadable...


  INT. BEDCHAMBER/PERISTYLE - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Titus rests in bed.  Sweating.  Barely conscious.  ADJUST TO 
  FIND the MEDICUS outside in the peristyle, delivering the 
  news to Batiatus and Lucretia.  Oenomaus looms a few paces 
  behind, concern etching his face.  Melitta beside him.

                                          MEDICUS
                        Your father burns high fever.  A 
                        worrisome condition, for a man of 
                        his years.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Is there nothing to be done?

                                          MEDICUS
                        I have not the herbs.  And the hour 
                      is late for us to procure them.

  Batiatus shares a pained look with Lucretia.  Despite 
  everything, the man is still his father.

  Medicus hustles out with Batiatus and Oenomaus.  OFF 
  LUCRETIA, considering her options....


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  CLOSE on a CUP as it s filled with honeyed wine.  WIDEN TO 
  REVEAL Lucretia pouring it from the ORNATE AMPHORA given to 
  Titus by Tullius.  Titus COUGHS, pale and barely conscious.

                        Drink.

  Lucretia forces a smile.  She sets the cup down and hands 
  the amphora to Melitta.  Melitta takes it, her own concerns 
  for Gannicus bubbling to the surface.

  INT. GANNICUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  CANDLELIGHT dances across Gannicus  battered face.  He sits 
  on the floor, lost in thought of what has been lost.  The 
  door opens behind him.

  MELITTA APPEARS,

  the amphora of mulsum from Tullius still clutched in her 
  hands.  Gannicus stares at her silently for a beat.  He has 
  no words.  Melitta struggles to find a few of her own.

  mounting sadness.

                        taste.

  She knows he s not talking just about wine.

  She takes a deep drink of her own cup to steel her nerves 
  for what she has to tell him.

                        Because despite my words... I stand 
                      as weak...

  She kisses him, her hands trembling.  Gannicus looks into 
  her eyes and finally sees what he has been searching for.  
  As he takes her into his arms...


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON TITUS, wracked by a fit of COUGHING.  WIDEN as 
  Lucretia presses the cup of mulsum she poured from Tullius  
  amphora to his lips.

                                        TITUS
                        I want no wine.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Medicus gave order.  Drink.

  Titus reluctantly complies.  His fit passes.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        There.  That should help you rest.

  Titus eyes her through a fog of fever.  Dissecting her.

                                        TITUS
                      My son... gives up everything for 
                        you.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      As I for him.

                                        TITUS
                        You truly love him?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        With all my heart.

  Titus COUGHS.  He s weak.  And very honest here.

                                        TITUS
                      He is never happier, than when he 
                      is by your side.
                                (wanting it to be 
                                  true)
                        Tell me I have been mistaken about 
                        you.  Tell me you are not the 
                        serpent I have thought you to be.

  Tears shine in Lucretia s eyes as she responds with equal 
  honesty.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I am not.

  Titus sees the sincerity of that.  The smile of impending 
  truce bends his lips.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I am far worse.

  Titus COUGHS, his smile fading.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I never cared what you thought of 
                        me.  My lack of breeding.  The 
                        absence of family or a name of 
                        worth.  These things I cannot deny.  
                        Yet how low you considered your 
                        son... a man I love more than life 
                        itself...  That could not be 
                        tolerated.  So I began to poison 
                        your beloved honeyed wine.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  Titus  eyes widen in shock.  He tries to speak, but is 
  seized by a fit of deep, wet COUGHS.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                      My intent not to rob you of life.  
                        Only to mimic illness.  A cough, 
                        increasing in its discomfort, 
                        easily blamed on Capua s dust and 
                        heat.

  Titus GASPS for air.  Sweat pouring from his brow.  Hands 
  clutching the sheets.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                      It brought much joy when you 
                        departed for the wet shores of 
                        Sicilia.  And Quintus, how he 
                        flourished when removed from 
                        beneath overbearing shadow.
                                  a beat, soft)(
                        Then you returned.  To torture him, 
                      as you did all those years.  So I 
                        began bringing you your honeyed 
                        wine again.  To force you back to 
                        Sicilia.  Yet it was not enough.  
                        You were not moved, despite ailing 
                        health.  No.  A more permanent 
                        solution was required between us 
                        this time.  One that I have added 
                      to Tullius  gift.

  Titus  eyes fall on the wine cup.  The fatal dose.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Quintus will not forgive Tullius 
                        for this.  He will strike in your 
                        name.  And Gaia s death will be 
                        avenged.

  Titus goes into a seizure, coughing blood.  INTERCUT WITH:


  INT. GANNICUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Gannicus and Melitta are lost in each other s embrace, 
  mouths and hands desperately exploring... Gannicus starts to 
  remove her dress.  She stops him, her eyes widening with 
  sudden fear as she begins COUGHING.

                                          MELITTA
                        Gannicus....



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

  She coughs BLOOD, going into the same kind of seizure as 
  Titus.  Gannicus doesn t know what to do.  RACK TO TULLIUS  
  AMPHORA siting behind them.  The poison claiming an 
    unsuspecting victim.


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Titus claws at Lucretia s gown, spitting out his final 
    blood-soaked words.

                                        TITUS
                        You curse this house.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  with tenderness)(
                        No, father.  I elevate it.

  Titus  breathing slows.  Stops.  His hand releases her, his 
  eyes dead.  Lucretia looks on, resplendent in her wig.  A 
  red serpent made flesh.  A slight smile of victory bends her 
  lips as she rises from Titus  bedside and drifts out into --


  INT. PERISTYLE - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Lucretia s smile shatters, her eyes falling on Melitta 
  carried in Gannicus  arms.  A stricken Naevia and Two Guards 
  accompany him.  Naevia holds the poisoned amphora of honeyed 
  wine.

  MELITTA S EYES ARE OPEN,

  yet staring lifelessly.  She is dead, blood staining her 
  lips and dress.  Lucretia s eyes widen in horror.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  destroyed)(
                        The wine... it was the wine...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Return to the ludus.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Domina --

  She motions for the Guard to take Melitta.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Oenomaus must not know she came to 
                        your cell.  She was never with you.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.
  CONTINUED:

  The Guard takes Melitta s body.  Gannicus reluctantly 
  releases her.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Go.

  The other Guard escorts him out.  Gannicus looks back at 
  Melitta, devastated.  MUSIC SWELLS, propelling us into a 
  MONTAGE OF SLOW MOTION GRIEF --


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Batiatus and Oenomaus rush through the atrium as they 
  return, faces stricken with the news delivered by Naevia.  
  Medicus is left in their wake.


  INT. PERISTYLE - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Oenomaus sees the Guard holding Melitta s body.  He takes 
  it, sinking to his knees as he cradles her, devastated.

  BATIATUS

  looks to Lucretia, stunned and shocked.  What the fuck has 
  happened?  Lucretia s eyes move to the bedchamber in 
  response.  Batiatus reacts, his own eyes widening in fear as 
  he rushes into the bedchamber.


  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Batiatus freezes in horror.  Tears spill down his cheeks as 
  he kneels beside his dead father, clutching his hand. 
  Lucretia looms in the background.  Drained by what she has 
  had to do.  And deeply troubled for the price it has cost.  
  The CAMERA SINKS down, TRANSITIONING US TO --


  EXT. MESS HALL/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Oenomaus carries Melitta s body down from the villa.  
  Consumed with grief, he does not see

  GANNICUS

  standing by the cliff in the training square.  Gannicus 
  watches Oenomaus carry Melitta into the ludus.  SLOW PUSH IN 
  on Gannicus.  Melitta s blood still fresh on his skin.  Hot 
  tears of loss and guilt stinging his cheeks.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

  LIGHTNING FLASHES,

  followed by the crack of THUNDER.  The skies open, weeping 
  in sympathy.
