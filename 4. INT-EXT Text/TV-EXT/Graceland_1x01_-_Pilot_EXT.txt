      The lonely sound of a BUOY BELL in the distance. Water
      slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. The Vincent
      Thomas Bridge rising in the background like the bones of
      some long-dead behemoth.

      DONNIE MARTINEZ - 27, attractive - sits alone in a beat-to-
      shit Pontiac GTO. And to save time, every character in this
      script is pretty damn good looking unless you hear otherwise.

      Donnie scans the dirt parking area ahead of him. No sign of
      anyone. Over this, Campbell continues:

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    You are walking out of onebattlefield
                    onto another...

      Donnie casually plays with a flesh colored Super Ball - you
      know, those rubber balls you got out of a vending machine
      when you were a kid - he holds it in one hand, and passes                                                                                         2.


      his other hand in front of it, making it disappear. He turns
      over his hand, revealing that it never moved. As far as magic
      tricks go, it's a good one. 

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But the battlefield out there is
                    real.

      Donnie bounces the ball off the far window and catches it.
    He is a master of this particular skill set. He spins it on
      his fingertip like a miniature basketball.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    The dangers are real...

      Suddenly headlight beams rake across Donnie's face as an
      aging Lincoln pulls in and parks across from him. The car
      flashes its lights. Donnie flashes his lights back.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    You die out there, it's game over.

      Donnie reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a Drug
      Enforcement Agency badge identifying him as a special agent
      for the DEA. He opens the glove compartment, puts the badge
      inside, then slaps it closed. 

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I want you to take a moment and think
                    about that.

      Donnie holds up his Super Ball, makes it do one final
      disappearing act, then gets out of the car to join the two
      MEXICAN MEN - members of the Gallardo Cartel - just stepping
      out of the Lincoln, the passenger carrying a briefcase. They
      greet each other in Spanish with friendly waves.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Because I don't care who you are... 

    As Donnie and the Mexicans meet up and shake hands, another
      pair of headlights cuts the darkness, this time belonging to
      a newer model Mercedes. It parks, and three people get out.
      They are RUSSIAN MOBSTERS, members of the Vzakonye (pronounced
      Za-con-ya), or The Brotherhood. 

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    You're not going to live forever.

      The Russian men look like ex-weightlifters. The third is a
      WOMAN, a real beauty. We will know her soon as LAUREN. 

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      The Russian passenger removes a suitcase from the back seat
      and opens it on the trunk of the car. Inside are 20 kilos of
      heroin. The Mexicans open their briefcase: in it are stacks
    of hundred dollar bills.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    That means that at this moment you
                    are in a unique position that you
                    may never ever be in again...

      Donnie takes out his heroin rig (utensils for shooting up).

                                      DONNIE
                    Let's cook it up.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    You havenothing to lose. 

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      TIME CUTS OF DONNIE:

    As he cooks some of the heroin taken from a cut in one of
      the bags. The others watch him intently, especially the woman,
    as he loads the needle. 

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    Whatever you think success means in
                    this life...

      Donnie wraps a piece of surgical tubing around his upper
      arm, pokes the needle into the crook of his arm.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I hope you will stay open to the
                      possibility that you ve got it all
                    wrong.

      EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE NEEDLE

    We can see that Donnie hasn't injected his skin, but instead
      he's plunged the needle into the Super Ball that he's hidden
      from the crook of his arm. The trick has fooled both the
      Mexicans and the Russians.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    That you have absolutely no idea
                    what life has in store for you.

      Only the woman (Lauren) knows what he is up to. Donnie catches
      her eye - a silent communication passes between them - she's
      impressed with this particular bit of magic as he pushes
      down the syringe's plunger.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    And when that day comes...

      Donnie lets his eyes close and his body relax, mimicking the
      effects of the heroin. A thin smile traces across his lips. 

                                      DONNIE
                    Esta es la buena. 

      Both the Mexicans and the Russians smile. The deal can proceed.

      Donnie starts to pull out the needle and... the Super Ball
      slips. No reason. Just one of those terrible, shitty things
      that happen in life that change everything.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    And it will...                                                                                        5.


      The ball drops from Donnie's arm, bounces twice and is caught
    by the larger of the two Russian men.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Trust me. It will...

      A moment of collective silence. The RUSSIAN squeezes the
      ball and the liquefied heroin drips out of the needle hole...

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Sudden and complete hell breaks loose. The big RUSSIAN cross-
      draws with lightning swiftness, pulling a Sig Sauer .45 from
      his shoulder holster and FIRES twice -- Donnie's body jerks
    as both slugs penetrate. He slumps to the ground.

      The remaining Mexicans grab their briefcase full of money,
      yelling in Spanish as they stumble over themselves to get back
    to their Lincoln. The driver jams the car into gear, kicking
    up a hail of gravel as it tears out of the parking lot.

      The Woman is screaming at the shooter in Russian as he steps
    up to the body, takes dead-aim at the center of Donnie's head--

      She grabs his arm, imploring him to get in the car. Off in
      the distance we hear POLICE SIRENS. 

      The man considers... at last he re-holsters the gun, lets
      the woman drag him into the Mercedes. She throws a last long
      look at Donnie's body as the car tears into the night.

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      They walk along the boardwalk. Mike is carrying his bags,
      trying to keep up with Tuturro. Tuturro throws a questioning
      thumb at Mike's earbuds.

                                      TUTURRO
                    What are you listening to?

                                    MIKE
                    Spanish. For the language requirement.

      Tuturro laughs, shakes his head.

                                      TUTURRO
                    It's a bitch. I can read Miranda in
                    twelve different languages.

                                    MIKE
                          (overwhelmed)
                    Twelve?

                                      TUTURRO
                    LA's a melting pot. 

      A pair of girls pass in bikinis. Mike can't help but stare. 

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, it's like this all the time.
                    Except during Spring Break. Then it
                    gets really out of hand. Do you surf? 

                                    MIKE
                    No.

                                      TUTURRO
                    You will. Do you have shorts?
                    Sunscreen?

                                    MIKE
                    No. No.

                                      TUTURRO
                      Flip-flops?

                                    MIKE
                    What?

                                      TUTURRO
                    You've got to go shopping.

      Mike takes out his notebook and writes down flip-flops.
      Another girl smiles at Mike as she passes.                                                                                         20.


                                    MIKE
                    Do the people around here know?

                                      TUTURRO
                    That we're feds? No way. We tell 'em
                    different things. Briggs says he's a
                    ski instructor. One girl I'm dating
                    thinks I'm a Lear jet pilot.

                                    MIKE
                    She believes that? 

      Tuturro takes out his keys, shows him a barrel shaped one.

                                      TUTURRO
                    See this? It's a Lear jet key.

                                    MIKE
                    It looks like the key to a bike lock. 

                                      TUTURRO
                    You're smarter than the girl I'm
                    dating.

                                    MIKE
                    Tell me about Briggs.

                                      TUTURRO
                    He's the best agent I've ever seen.
                    You're lucky you got in the house.

                                    MIKE
                    That's what they keep telling me.

                                      TUTURRO
                    This is it.

      They stop in front of... GRACELAND. A sprawling, expensive
      villa nestled a hundred feet from the ocean. The kind of
      place I'll buy if this show is a huge hit.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Not bad, huh? 

                                    MIKE
                    Why do they call it Graceland?

                                      TUTURRO
                    We seized it from this drug lord,
                    Cardenez -- guy was a hard-core Elvis
                    freak. When they turned it into a
                    flop house for us no one wanted to
                    pay to redecorate, so the name stuck.

      Tuturro points to the letters "EP" wrought into the iron
      scrollwork on the door.                                                                                        21.


                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    See that? When Elvis remodeled the
                    real Graceland, Cardenez bought the
                    old doors. 
                          (off Mike's impressed
                          look)
                    It gets better. 

      Tuturro opens the door and they step into...


      A pair of Jamaican men, dressed in traditional red, green
      and gold shemiz (shirts) and tams are standing around the
      liftgate of a truck that shields them from the view of
      customers walking along the boardwalk. STEEL DRUM RHYTHMS of
      Marley's "CHANT DOWN BABYLON" pump from the stereo of a half-
      restored Monte Carlo in the foreground. 

      The Jamaicans are involved in the illegal bird trade. From
      their heavily accented English you would guess they were
      from British Guiana.                                                                                         25.


      The TALL JAMAICAN examines a parrot held by the SHORT
      JAMAICAN. Both cast cautious glances around as they talk.

                                      SHORT JAMAICAN
                    I can get you two hundred of these
                    little guys next week. Three hundred.

                                    TALL JAMAICAN
                    Too much.

                                      SHORT JAMAICAN
                    Come on, man. These are yellow-headed
                    Amazon. Every rich white couple in
                    the valley will pay you a thousand.

                                    TALL JAMAICAN
                    Two hundred.

                                      SHORT JAMAICAN
                    We split it. Two-fifty.

                                    TALL JAMAICAN
                    Okay man. We have a deal. But they
                    all better talk. 

                                      SHORT JAMAICAN
                    Like my wife. They will never shut
                    up.

      Both men laugh, hug and say good-byes. The tall Jamaican
      gets in the Monte Carlo and drives.

    He turns a corner and we see an amazing transformation take
      place. The crocodile smile fades as he ejects the Marley CD,
      drops in Coltrane's "LUSH LIFE." He takes off the tam, pulls
    on a black leather Monty and a pair of Wayfarers. 

    He flips over a photograph sitting on his dashboard. It's of
      himself and a 10-year-old kid - his son. He kisses the picture
      and settles back, the smooth jazz soothes him as he drives.

      Meet U.S. Customs Agent DALE JAKES.


      A cloudy platinum morning. Glassy, blue walls of water
      beckoning from beyond the soup. 


      Muted thunder as five-foot sets CRASH below a crimson sky.
      The sun is still beyond the horizon. 

      Briggs and Mike come out in wetsuits. Mike is carrying a big
      training board -- a rhino chaser they call it. Briggs has
      his short board. He is in instructor mode.

                                      BRIGGS
                    This is a south swell with a five
                    foot face. Manhattan breaks left so
                    stay to this side of the pier or
                    you're gonna get slammed...

                                    MIKE
                          (trying to absorb it)
                    Right. South swell.

    As Briggs continues his lecture, Tuturro comes running out
      after them, pulling on his suit.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Hey Briggs! You were supposed to
                    wake me up!

      Briggs ignores him, looks at Mike.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Surfing is about balance and
                      coordination. You got balance, right? 

                                    MIKE
                          (convincing himself)
                    Yeah.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Let's hit it, Poseidon.


      WHAAAAAM! Mike is CRUSHED by a wave.                                                                                        32.


      He's flipped off his board and the roll churns him like a
      washing machine. Stunned, gasping for breath, he fights to
      pull himself up back onto his board.

      Briggs and Tuturro watch from their boards, bobbing out beyond
      the break.

      Mike bellyboards all the way onto shore. He staggers across
      the sand, drops onto his towel. Shivering. Miserable.

    He goes to put on his new flip-flops, but the right one is
      missing. He looks around and spots a stray collie fifteen
      feet away, staring at him, his flip-flop in its mouth.

                                    MIKE
                    Come on boy. Bring it back.

      The dog continues to stare.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Drop it! Come on, drop it!

      Mike gets to his feet and takes a few steps towards the
      collie. The dog moves a few steps back.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I'm not in the mood.

    He rushes the dog. It takes off running across the sand,
      cuts inland and disappears onto the boardwalk along with
      Mike's flip-flop.

      Mike stands there, wet, exhausted, with only one shoe. From
      behind him:

                                      CHARLIE
                    Enjoying yourself yet?

      Mike turns, perking up at her presence.

                                    MIKE
                    No. I'm not.

    He laughs, and drops back down on to his towel. Charlie sits
      next to him. They look out to the ocean. Briggs has just
      caught the front of a monster.

    He moves like a dancer, in perfect harmony with the wave.
      Dipping, carving, slicing, making it look easy.

                                      CHARLIE
                    So what do you think of Briggs?

                                    MIKE
                    Look at him. He's amazing.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'm not talking about the surfing.                                                                                        33.


      She eyes him, knowing Briggs is nothing like he expected.

                                    MIKE
                    At Quantico they talk about him like
                    he's some sort of God.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Were they wrong?

      Mike laughs.

                                    MIKE
                    I wasn't expecting the long hair.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You are expecting the perfect FBI
                    agent. Button down. Suit and tie.

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah.

                                      CHARLIE
                    He was like that once.

                                    MIKE
                    What happened?

                                      CHARLIE
                    About eight years ago something went
                    down. Briggs took a leave of absence.
                    He came back all zenned out like
                    that.

                                    MIKE
                    You don't know what changed him?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Nope. He never talks about it, and
                    the case file was sealed.

                                    MIKE
                    You tried to get the case file?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Are you judging me? Don't go judging
                    me.

                                    MIKE
                    I'm not.

                                      CHARLIE
                          (playful)
                    Yeah. You are. 
                          (more serious)
                    The house is a tight fit. If one of
                    us is jacked in the head then the
                    others need to know about it.
                          (beat)
                    There are no secrets in Graceland.                                                                                        34.


                                    MIKE
                    Except for Briggs.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah. Except for Briggs.

      Mike considers that as he watches Briggs shred the ocean.
      Mike stands up, suddenly with new determination. He grabs
      his board and charges into the waves.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Kick that waves ass, Mike!

    As he's swallowed up by the water we TRANSITION TO:


      Briggs driving, Mike in the passenger seat. Tuturro in back
      leaning up between them as they cruise through Hollywood.

                                      BRIGGS
                    This is a simple reverse. You walk
                    in the apartment, make the deal,
                    give us the bust signal. 

      Mike has his notebook out. He's nervous. Writing furiously.

                                    MIKE
                    Okay. So what's my name?

      Briggs and Tuturro swap looks.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Your name's Mike.

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Then go with Mike. 

      Mike writes that down.

                                    MIKE
                    Last name?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Don't give him a last name.

      Mike writes that down. "No last name." Briggs gets annoyed.
      Throws the notebook out the window. 

                                    MIKE
                    What did you do that for?

                                      BRIGGS
                    You can't take a crib sheet with
                    you. Keep it simple. Where are you
                    from?

                                    MIKE
                    Boston.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Then if he asks, you're from Boston.
                    But bad guys don't ask a lot of
                    questions because they don't want
                    you asking a lot of questions. 

      They ride in silence.                                                                                        38.


                                    MIKE
                    What's our legend?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Our what?

                                    MIKE
                    Our backstory. How'd we meet?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Our legend? Is that what they're
                    teaching at Quantico?

                                    MIKE
                    How do we know each other... if he
                    asks?

                                      BRIGGS
                    If he asks just say "around". 

                                      TUTURRO
                    Come on Briggs, make it interesting.
                    Put him in the movie.

                                      BRIGGS
                    No way.

                                    MIKE
                    What movie?

                                      BRIGGS
                    It's nothing.

      Briggs signals for Tuturro to shut the fuck up. Too late,
      Mike turns to him.

                                    MIKE
                    What's the movie?

                                      TUTURRO
                    This is great. So we're on this three
                    month undercover sting of the Colima
                    Cartel. These guys are hard core --
                    shoot you just to see if the gun
                    works. In the middle of this, Briggs
                    gets some freakin' Bureau award, top
                    seizure agent of the century or some
                    thing. CNN sends a camera crew, so
                    for a week they've got his face
                    plastered all over the news.
                          (pauses for dramatic
                            effect)
                    We're meeting with the heads of the
                    family... 

                                                                          FLASH CUT TO:                                                                                        39.


      The area is surprisingly middle-class. Mike parks his car --
      a used Chevy Malibu -- at the curb, walks up to the door
      with his backpack. KNOCKS. 

      A young kid, ALEX, 10, answers. Mike is taken aback by this. 

                                    MIKE
                    I'm looking for Felix.

                                    ALEX
                    Dad!

      FELIX, a jovial Mexican, appears at the door.

                                      FELIX
                    Hey! You're Paul's friend?
                          (Mike nods)
                    Right on time. Come on in. You want
                    some lemonade?

      Mike follows him inside. 


      Four unmarked FBI takedown cars lurch forward from their
      stakeout positions, nearly colliding. Like something out of
      the Keystone Cops...

      BACK TO THE RV COMMAND POST - SAME TIME

      Briggs and Silvo, listening to confused radio chatter:

                                      RADIO CHATTER (V.O.)
                    ... I've lost 'em...
                          (and)
                    ... Negative, negative, no visual...
                          (and)
                    Can't get in there without burning it!

      Briggs runs a hand through his hair. Weighing options...

                                      BRIGGS
                    I can get a guy in there on foot.

      Briggs and Silvo simultaneously turn and look at Tuturro. 

                                      SILVO
                    You were running fast in fifth grade,
                    right Tuturro? 

      Tuturro rips off his FBI jacket, mutters in indignation.


      Tuturro running like a madman toward the alley... 


      Mike and Felix come out. There's a big semitrailer taking up
      most of the alley. Felix opens the back.

                                      FELIX
                    Check it out. Levi's finest. 

                                    MIKE
                    Jeans?

                                      FELIX
                    Twelve-thousand pairs.

      Mike lets out a low whistle.                                                                                        47.


                                    MIKE
                    You want to trade straight across
                    for the eight?

      Felix clutches his chest, feigns a heart attack.

                                      FELIX
                    Straight? Come on man, you can get
                      fifteen-bucks a pair on the street.
                    That's uh... uh... 

                                    MIKE
                    A hundred and eighty thousand.

                                      FELIX
                    Yeah. That's a lot of money.

                                    MIKE
                    And I bet your wife's chewing your
                    ass to get this thing out of here.

      Felix laughs, slaps a brotherly arm around Mike.

                                      FELIX
                    Tell you what, bro, you make this
                    thing disappear and we got a deal.

                                    MIKE
                    I think I can make that happen.
                          (offers his hand)
                    Pleasure doing business with you,
                    Felix.

      The men shake hands. A beat. From way down the alley we hear
      someone SHOUTING. We can just make out Tuturro running and
      huffing toward them, holding up what must be a badge.

                                      FELIX
                    What the hell is that guy yelling?

      Distantly, we hear:

                                      TUTURRO
                    ... Federal... Bureau... 

      Suddenly the four takedown cars explode into the alley, dash
      lights and SIRENS blasting. Felix's face collapses. 

      The cars blow past Tuturro. AGENTS jumping out, screaming,
      "FBI! GET DOWN!" Felix raises his arms. Mike does the same.

      Tuturro runs up, gun drawn, completely out of breath.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Federal... federal... screw it, you're
                    both under arrest.

      Tuturro drops Mike down next to Felix on the hood of a car
      and cuffs him.                                                                                        48.


                                      FELIX
                    Irina's gonna kill me. I knew these
                    jeans were bad luck.

      Mike registers the slightest moment of guilt as Tuturro yanks
      him away.

      ANGLE ON: SILVO - MINUTES LATER

    In the alley, mad as hell. Screaming into his hand radio and
    at anyone who will listen.

                                      SILVO
                    I need something that can haul a
                    half-billion jeans... That's what I
                    said!... Blue Jeans. No, I don't
                    know where they're going.

    He picks up a pair. Laughs ironically.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    And they're knock-offs! Hallelujah. 


      A serious game of beach volleyball is going down, the court
      rimmed by a dozen car HEADLIGHTS at the edge of the sand.

      Briggs, Tuturro and a half dozen locals face off against
      Mike, Charlie and their locals.

      MONTAGE STYLE - The competition is fierce. Killer serves.
      Devastating spikes. This is beach sport raised to mortal
      combat.

      And Mike, caught up in all of it, having a great time.

      The game ends when Mike digs one out of the sand and Charlie
      smashes it home. High fives all around.

      Briggs shoots looks to the Graceland agents.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Just us.

      Charlie and Tuturro know what this means. Mike follows them
    as they stay by the locals and head farther down the beach.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      The Graceland Agents sit on the sand next to a blazing fire
    in a cement firepit. No locals this time. Someone has dragged
      out an old radio and music plays.

      Four shot glasses raised. Mike, Briggs, Tuturro and Charlie --
      salt on their wrists, each holding a slice of lime.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Everybody here has bought dope as a
                    rookie. Some of us even on the job.                                                                                        50.


      A few laughs.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    This was one to remember. 

      They CLINK glasses, then everyone licks the salt off their
      wrists, downs the shots, then sucks the lime. Everyone but
      Mike who is hopelessly lost.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Too much studying, not enough
                    partying. You never done a shot?

                                    MIKE
                    Back east we just drink it. We don't
                    dance with it.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Let me show you.

      She pours him another shot. She licks her own hand and
      sprinkles salt on it. 

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, first you lick off the salt.

      She holds out her hand. Mike sucks the salt off. It's a sexy
      move, no doubt about it.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Now drink.

    No problem. Mike pounds the shot. 

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Now suck.

      Mike bites the lime, the sour twisting up his face. 

      Charlie busts up laughing, jumps over, cranks the stereo.
      SALSA. Pulsing and sexy. She begins to move, the music
      sweeping her into its rhythm. Her body tight... hot... Her
      eyes on Mike. She's pulling him up with her... their bodies
      pressing into each other... and Mike, finding he can't look
      away...

      And at that moment - the worst possible moment - Mike's cell
      phone begins to RING. He can't help himself - he checks it.
      It's Campbell.

                                    MIKE
                    I've got to take this.

      Mike steps away from the party and takes the call.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Agent Campbell.                                                                                        51.


                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    Agent Warren. How are things on the
                    other side of the world?

      Mike looks toward the fire and Charlie dancing there.

                                    MIKE
                    Things are... getting better, sir.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    Good. I've got the deputy director
                    convinced that taking you out of DC
                    is a personal affront to the Bureau. 

      Mike is only partially listening because at that moment Briggs
      sweeps Charlie into his arms and she kisses him. This is no
      friendly peck on the cheek. This is passion.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But I'm encountering an unusual level
                    of resistance here. A lot of locked
                    doors that have me concerned.

      That pulls Mike out of it. 

                                    MIKE
                    Locked doors?

                                      CAMPBELL  (V.O.)
                    What I'm saying is that I have no
                    idea what's going on. Some powerful
                    forces have aligned to move you to
                    L.A. This is more than just politics. 
                    Sit tight. We'll figure out how to
                    get you back to D.C.

                                    MIKE
                    I would like that, sir. 

      Mike hangs up the phone, concerned about what Campbell has
      told him. He watches Briggs and Charlie dancing. Nothing in
      his life makes sense.


      Mike follows Nayfeld out. A Mercedes waiting there with a
      DRIVER. They get in the back. 


      The Mercedes approaches a Russian restaurant, "PALICH", one
    of those neighborhood dives that never has a dinner rush and
      the regulars view any newcomer with suspicion.

      The car turns into a side alley and glides into an underground
      parking structure.


      A BLACK MERCEDES SUV, with heavily tinted windows, glides to
      a stop at the curb.


      Ludwig and Benjamin in the Mercedes. They can hear the MUFFLED
      SHOTS from inside the house. A quick series of two, followed
    by two more. The brothers exchange a nod. It looks like the
      kid pulled it off...

      A long beat -- the front door opens, Mike comes out, walking
      quickly, gun hand tucked in his jacket pocket, throwing
      worried looks back at the house. He gets in the car, his
      breath coming in ragged gasps.

                                    MIKE
                    You didn't tell me he was a goddamn
                    DEA agent!

                                      LUDWIG
                    Is he dead?

                                    MIKE
                    Yes.

                                      LUDWIG
                    Give me the gun.

      Mike hands over the .38. Ludwig takes it with the cloth by
      the barrel, slips it into a Ziploc.

                                    MIKE
                    You'll let the family go?

                                      LUDWIG
                    Yes, but if Felix talks, the police
                    get this gun in the mail.                                                                                        76.


                                    MIKE
                    I get it. Just drive.

      The car pulls away from the curb. Mike casts a last furtive
      glance back at the silent home as they speed into the night.


      Mike sits alone on the sand, watching the rhythm of the waves.
      His phone RINGS. It's Campbell.                                                                                        78.


                                    MIKE
                    Agent Campbell.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    Mike! What the hell are you doing
                    out there, son? Less than a week and
                    you're already a rock star.

                                    MIKE
                    Just doing my job, sir.

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    Keep it up. Listen to me, Mike. The
                    more I dig into this the more
                    concerned I get.

                                    MIKE
                    What do you mean, sir?

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    The order to move you to LA came
                    down form the top. It has something
                    to do with Briggs. 

                                    MIKE
                          (Mike's face falls)
                    Briggs?

                                      CAMPBELL (V.O.)
                    That's right. At first I thought it
                    was just political dick swinging but
                    it's not. I don't know who wants you
                    there and I don't know why, but Briggs
                    is involved. I'll keep digging. Hold
                    tight, kid.

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir.

      The phone goes dead. Mike ponders everything Campbell said,
      not liking the implication. He looks up to see the stray
      dog/collie sitting a few yards away, staring at him. It's
      got his flip-flop in its mouth, but it's been chewed so
      heavily it barely resembles something you could put on your
      foot.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    You son of a bitch.

      The dog brings the flip-flop over and drops it at his feet.
      Mike examines the chewed mess and pats the dog on the head.
    It lays down next to him and puts its head in his lap.

      Mike and the dog sit, watching the sunset over the Pacific.

                                                                                FADE OUT.



                                        THE END
