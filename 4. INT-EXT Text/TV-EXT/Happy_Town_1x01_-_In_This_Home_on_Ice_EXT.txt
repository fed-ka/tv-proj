    A dense, mossy-floored FOREST of pine, aspen, birch and 
      tamarack.  Vaguely-limned by a heavily-bruised moon, dimmed 
    by angry clouds approaching from the southern sky...

    WE GLIDE through this thick undergrowth, lashed by the wind 
    and spit-on by a light rain, and WE HEAR:

                                  GIRL S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Maybe one of these days, you ll 
                    actually be able to drop me off in 
                    front of my house -- 

      The response is male.  And muffled.  The sound of A CAR DOOR 
      OPENING... Just as WE CREST a line of black fir trees on a 
      hill brow.... To ARRIVE AT the mint  69 CUTLASS 442, 
          splendidly-restored, parked on this promontory overlooking --

      MAC S POND

      which is technically more of a lake, in that it covers some 
      six square miles, most of which are now FROZEN-OVER.  This is 
    a popular make-out spot for the local high-schoolers...

      Indeed.  A GIRL emerges from the passenger side of the 
      Cutlass.  Her name is GEORGIA BRAVIN, 17.  And, as she gets 
      her bits together (coat, scarf, hat), after a heated session, 
      we can see she is very pretty, almost in spite of herself.

      She leans down to the passenger-side window... 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Late --

      And she walks off.  Straight into the pitch of the woods...


      Georgia hews to the path that wends its way along the banks 
      of Mac's Pond.  It is quiet, but for the distant rumble of 
      thunderheads, as she picks her way along the scrim of frost-
      rimed rock and dirt and branch...

      When she hears what sounds like A SCREAM.  Coming from the 
      pond.  Coming from the middle of the pond...

      Georgia squints.  She can barely make-out, in the occluded 
      moonlight, the SMALL FRAME SHACK in the center of the pond...                                                                                      2.


    It is an ICE FISHING HUT.  And, oddly enough, there appears 
    to be a LIGHT on inside of it...

      Georgia frowns.  As another CRY splits the night.  Yes, that 
      was definitely a human cry... 

      Georgia debates whether or not to investigate.  All around 
      her, dead branches rustle dryly, like dead men s bones...  

    In a birch snag, an OWL HOOTS, as they so often do in these 
      instances, startling her... Georgia looks up at the treetops:

                                  GEORGIA
                    Are you kidding me, dude?

    Her eyes tick back to the ice shack.  And she makes a 
      decision.  She steps out onto the pond s frozen surface... 
    And begins to walk toward the ice shack, some 20 yards away.

      When suddenly it begins to POUR.  Coming down in thick, 
      sideways sheets... 

    So Georgia gives up the sleuthing.  And beats a hasty retreat 
    the way she came...

    We, however, remain at the shoreline.  Staring directly at 
    the ice shack.  As a SHADOW moves across the lone window.  

    And we HARD CUT TO:

    A KNOBBY FINGER PRESSING PLAY ON AN OLD-SCHOOL BOOM BOX.

    As the crunchy aggro riff of Megadeth s metal classic, 
       Symphony Of Destruction  begins --


    An old-school depot on the outskirts of town.  A bright, 
      sunny day.  The storm has passed.  Leaving us with a March 
      morning, as crisp and clear as a flute of flat champagne...

    The flashing SIGNAL GANTRY heralds the arrival of the TRAIN - 
    a rambling, eleven-car affair.  A few COMMUTERS get on.  
      Heading to the Twin Cities.

      Only one person emerges.  A GIRL, early 20s.  Her look is 
          lonely-little-rag-doll meets early 90s Seattle Grunge.  She 
      carries a duffel bag and a guitar case.  This is HENLEY. *

    The train is quick to leave the station. And Henley is the 
      only one left.  She stands there.  Unsure as to her next 
      move.  When --

    A MINI-VAN pulls up.  A spry little blonde, early 30s - all 
      chirpy good cheer and blonde side-swept bangs - at the wheel.  
      This is MIRANDA KIRBY, Real-Estate-Agent-cum-Welcome-Wagon-
          Envoy-cum-Former-Pep-Rally-General...

      Miranda bounds from the van like a perfumed labrador.                                                                                      5.


                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    It s Henley, isn t it?   I m 
                    Miranda Kirby!  How fun!  Welcome 
                    to Haplin!  You are going to 
                    looooove it here!

      And, yes, Miranda Kirby speaks in staccato bursts of joy that 
      must have exclamation points affixed to them...

      Miranda grabs Henley s duffel... Her words a non-stop gout, 
      with what appears to be no pause for breathe:

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Do you play the guitar?  I always 
                    wanted to play!  Took lessons when 
                    I was nine.  But I didn t like my 
                    teacher.  He smelled.  So I asked 
                    my parents if I could quit.  And 
                    they let me!  

      Miranda tosses the duffel in the back of the van... 

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    I have half a mind to sue them now!  
                    Can you imagine if they hadn t let 
                    me quit?  I d be flippin  Eric 
                    Clapton today!  My Jordan (she s 
                    eight!), is going to start taking 
                    lessons this summer.  And if she 
                    wants to quit?  Sorry, customer!  
                      No-can-doofus!

    As Miranda goes around to the driver s side... Henley smiles 
      slightly at this shiny, happy person and WE CUT TO:


    A robust craftsman on a lovely cedar-lined street.  A 28-foot 
      performance FISHING BOAT - with a forward-casting platform 
      deck and  Dallas Alice  painted on its transom in cursive 
      curves - sits on a trailer in the driveway...

      Next to it, is parked an SUV and a Welly Crown Victoria, with 
    the words  Haplin County Sheriff  stencilled on the sides...


    As they pass the sign ( WELCOME TO HAPLIN:  WHERE THE BREAD *
      ALSO RISES ) Miranda Kirby gives Henley the quickie tour of 
      this small (population, 9,000), lake-spangled berg, some 40 
      miles from Minneapolis, clenched between empurpled, 
      stratified cliffs and majestic strands of Norway pine 
      forests...*

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    This area was first occupied by the 
                    Sisseton Indians.  One of the seven 
                    original tribes of the Dakota... 

      We should be struck by the splendor here:  the Victorian  *
      houses and family farms;  the latticework of canoe trails and 
      tawny oceans of wheat.  Pheasants fly to the shelter of an  *
      alfalfa field;  above abandoned copper mines, adits grown- *
      over with bluegrass, decades after the ore went dry...

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    The first white man to set foot 
                    here, was Wilmont Haplin, who came 
                    to map out the area in 1846... 

      They pass the entrance to an enormous GATED MANSE.  It s one 
      of those houses with a name:   WEEPING WALL ...                                                                                      9.


                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Wilmont Haplin is the great, great, 
                    great grandfather of John Haplin, 
                    whose mother, Mrs. Peggy Haplin 
                    lives there.  She s The Grand Dame. 
                    Pretty much runs this whole show! 

      Henley notices a strange BIT OF GRAFFITI spray-painted on the 
      side of a building:  it is A QUESTION MARK WITH A HALO OVER 
      IT... But before she can comment, they have driven into --

      DOWNTOWN, HAPLIN*

    A bucolic sprawl of 19th century wood and brick structures,  *
      with more modern buildings interspersed: the St. Paul Church, 
      with its patron saints carved in stone and set in apsidal 
      chapels.  The Sheriff s Station.  The shops and saloons.  The  *
      boardwalk, imprinted with the area s ranch brands... *

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    So why have you chosen Haplin, hon?   *
                    Aside from wanting to display 
                      impeccable geographic taste!

                                  HENLEY
                    My mother vacationed here.  As a 
                    child.  She recently passed away.   *
                    But she always spoke so fondly of 
                    this place... 

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    What do you plan to do?*

                                    HENLEY*
                    Maybe open a candle shop.  With my  *
                      inheritance?  What do you think?  *

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY*
                    That s amazing!  I adore candles!   *
                      Especially scented ones!  *

                                    HENLEY*
                    Then you ll love my  Strawberry *
                    Fields Glow-ever  candle.  I use  *
                    sweet sun-ripened strawberries in  *
                    the wax and hand-grubby the top with  *
                    banana slice wicks.  The aroma! *

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY*
                    Put me down for five!  And when  *
                    you re ready to look at retail  *
                    space, I m your girl -- !*

      Henley sniffs the air... She has noticed it since she here:                                                                                    10.


                                  HENLEY
                    Speaking of aroma.  Everything  *
                    smells so good here --*

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Of course it does, sweetie.  Look --

      Miranda gestures to the FACTORY, up on the hill, presiding 
      over all, smokestacks billowing smudgy fingers of industrial 
      cumulus across the otherwise perfectly blue sky... 

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    That s the bread factory.   Our 
                    Daily  Baking And Confectionery.  
                    The locals call it  The Bready .  
                    And, in this day and age, with 
                    factories closing down all over the 
                    country, not only does that 
                    wonderful place employ 12 percent 
                    of Haplin s residents, but it also 
                    makes Haplin a place where the air 
                    is alive, not with uncertainty, but 
                    with the aroma of baking bread, all 
                    the live-long day!

    As the mini-van motors down Main Street, we recognize this  *
      place for what it is:  a glimpse of another era, frozen in an  *
      amber untouched by the voracious predation of Starbucks and  *
      Wal-Mart and Blockbuster...*

    But on a railroad trestle, Henley once again clocks the  *
      GRAFFITI OF THE QUESTION MARK WITH THE HALO OVER IT... *

      Miranda follows Henley s look.  Sees the question mark.  She  *
      grimaces.  But it is only fleeting, as her chirp returns: *

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY*
                    Welcome to Haplin.  Or, as some  *
                    folks like to call it:   Happy *
                    Town .  Because they know, Henley.   *

      Henley looks at Miranda and her rictus grin, which is almost  *
    as unsettling as whatever it hopes to conceal;  like the  *
      disinfectant used in hospitals to cover the smells of decay. *

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY*
                    They know.*

    OFF OF Henley.  As they drive beneath the railroad trestle.   *
    As she clocks that mysterious question mark, it is apparent  *
      that cryptic glyph has great meaning for her... *

                       END OF ACT ONE*                                                                                    11.


                          ACT TWO*


      Tommy and Emma are eyeballing the  Dallas Alice , in 
      preparation for taking it out of dry-dock...

                                  TOMMY
                    What do you think?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    I think it s too cold.

                                  TOMMY
                    You see that s where you re wrong.  
                    It s all about visualization.  
                    Yeah, it s too cold.  But if you 
                    think on it.  Wish on it.  
                    Visualize the  Dallas Alice  on 
                    Lake Spirit.  Are you seeing it?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Nope...

                                  TOMMY
                    Are you seeing my string?  With the 
                    glittering array of trout and 
                    sauger and walleye dangling from 
                    it?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Nope.

                                  TOMMY
                    Are you visualizing anything?

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Grilled cheese.

    He looks at her.  But then he clocks Georgia Bravin  - the 
      girl from our opening - ambling up the walk, with her 
      backpack... Emma doesn t see her...

                                  TOMMY
                    Okay, I ll prove that it works.  
                    Right now, I am visualizing your 
                    baby-sitter, Georgia, who has come 
                    to walk you to school... And, oh, 
                    hey, look -- !

      Emma does, sees Georgia... Shakes her head...

                                  GEORGIA
                    What are you guys doing?                                                                                    12.


                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Daddy is being dumb.

                                  GEORGIA
                    Daddy s do that...

    She helps Emma put her knapsack on.  To Tommy:

                                  GEORGIA
                    You really putting her in the water 
                    today?

                                  TOMMY
                    Yep.

                                  GEORGIA
                    Pond is still frozen-over.  I was 
                    by there last night...

                                  TOMMY
                    Pond isn t the lake.  And what were 
                    you doing by the pond last night?

    He looks at her, vaguely suspicious... But before she can 
      answer, another Haplin County Sheriff Welly Crown Vic pulls 
      up... Georgia smiles for:

                                  GEORGIA
                    Saved by the belly.

    And out steps SHERIFF GRIFFIN CONROY, early 60s.  Sheriff 
      Conroy has managed to retain the giddy ebullience that s 
      usually beaten out of men from these parts, when they get to 
    be this age.  And, yes, he s got an impressive gut.  Although 
    it looks to be made of poured concrete...

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Grampa -- !

    And she goes and wraps her little arms around his legs...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Hey, Li l Bean --

    He pats her head... Nods to Georgia...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    How s your father, Georgia?

                                  GEORGIA
                    Sleeping one off...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Ain t that much sleep in creation.                                                                                    13.


                                  GEORGIA
                    Truth.

      Sheriff Conroy turns to Tommy...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    We got a situation at the square.  
                    Wanna ride along?

                                  TOMMY
                    Not really.  It s my day-off.  
                    Gonna put the  Dallas Alice  in the 
                    water...

      Sheriff Conroy appraises the boat.  Named for his late wife.

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Too damn early in the season to put 
                    her in the water...

                                  TOMMY
                    What, was there some meeting this 
                    morning, where you all got together 
                    to talk about the weather?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Let s go...

                                  TOMMY
                    Lemme put on my khakis...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Your fine like you are.  We ll see 
                    ya later, Li l Bean?  Georgia.

                                  GEORGIA
                    So long, Sheriff --

      Tommy kisses Emma...

                                  TOMMY
                    Tell Mommy I had to leave.   Cause 
                    my Daddy is meaner than your Daddy.


      Henley and Miranda are on foot now... Walking along the 
      bustling Main Street...

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Are you hungry, Henley?

                                  HENLEY
                    I could eat.                                                                                    14.


    As they go, they pass a SMALL POSTER affixed to a TELEPHONE 
      POLE.  It has the PHOTOGRAPHS OF FIVE CHILDREN, between the 
      ages of 9 and 11, on it, beneath the SYMBOL Henley spied 
      earlier:  the question mark with the halo...

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    I know just the place.

    As they walk, Miranda snatches the poster off the telephone 
      pole.  Balls it up.  And tosses it into a trash can...


    The words:   The Home Of The Monster!  are painted in spooky, 
      horror-movie-style scrawl, on the plate glass window...  *


    An expansive plaza of grass and wrought-iron fence and old-
      timey gas lamps.  The square covers the equivalent of a city 
      block, and is now being readied for the  Thaw Fest :  

      Vendor booths are set-up, to sell food, arts and crafts, face-
      painting, etc.  And there are carnival-style games.  Bleacher- 
      seats and a band-riser are being erected...

    But right now there is something of a brouhaha brewing.  A 
      barrel-chested BLACK MAN, 46 - in  OUR DAILY  coveralls - is 
      regaling a GROUP OF WHITE MEN.  This is CARL DANCO.  And he 
      is enraged.  With him is a black woman, 40s, ZURI SORRELL.

                                  CARL DANCO
                    And I m saying this ain t close to 
                    right!  We been excluded for 14 
                    damn years!  And it stops now.  It 
                    stops here!

      The target of Danco s rage is JOHN HAPLIN, 38, and pretty 
      much the closest Haplin has to a Favorite Son...  With him is 
      PERRY STECKLER, 41... A large, angry, meat-faced fellow... *

                                  CARL DANCO
                    It s a damn glaring omission, ya  *
                    hear me?  This woman s son not 
                    being included!  A damn glaring  *
                    omission -- ! *

                                  PERRY STECKLER
                    Step back, Danco --

                                  CARL DANCO
                    You put that boy s picture on that 
                    banner... Or I swear to God, I will 
                    get the Reverend Sharpton down 
                    here, with a bunch of TV cameras, 
                    and we ll do a number on the steps 
                    of your bread factory - your white 
                    bread factory - have the whole damn 
                    state in tears... !

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    You keep trying to make this into a 
                    racial issue, Carl.  And I keep 
                    telling you it s a question of 
                    geography:  little Chad Sorrell was 
                    from Cook s Ridge.  Which is not 
                    Haplin proper.  Which is the only 
                    reason he is not included on the 
                    banner.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  JOHN HAPLIN (cont'd)
                    What all these kids have in common 
                    is that they are Haplin kids...

                                  CARL DANCO
                    What all these kids have in common 
                    is that they were taken by The 
                    Magic Man --

      And there is stunned silence from the crowd.  As if he has 
      said some kind of incantation that should never be uttered.

                                  PERRY STECKLER
                    You sonuvabitch -- !

      And he charges at Carl Danco... John Haplin and some of the 
      other men intervene... Just as Root Beer Rogers has arrived, 
      running up to the fracas, to separate the men...

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Settle down now, people.  

      But they don t... Danco goes for Haplin, Steckler goes for 
      Danco... Zuri Sorrell weeps... There is shouting and swearing 
      and considerable hue and cry... And then there is a WHISTLE.  
      An old-school wolf whistle... 

      All eyes turn... To where Sheriff Conroy and Tommy amble from 
      their Welly... Sheriff Conroy, walks with authority, hands 
      placed on either side of his belt, in proper  command 
      presence  posture.  He s as cool as a cobra.  To John Haplin:

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    Thought we agreed this wasn t to be 
                    hoisted, John -- ?

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    We agreed to nothing of the kind...

                                    SHERIFF CONROY
                    Sure we did.  We sat there.  At 
                    that City Council meeting.  And the 
                    talk was of healing.  Of not 
                    dwelling in the past.  And we 
                    agreed, then and there, this wasn t 
                    to be hoisted...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Which, I would imagine, is easy to 
                    do, when your own flesh and blood 
                    isn t pictured on it...

      More shouting... Sheriff Conroy studies the banner for a 
      beat... He looks at Tommy... Tommy, with his hands in his 
      back pockets... Sheriff Conroy shakes his head.                                                                                    18.


                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    As long as they remain missing, 
                    there is still hope, Sheriff...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    No doubt.  I m not trying to be 
                    insensitive, John.  Perry...  

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    Maybe you d like to discuss this 
                    with my mother...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Maybe I would...

    And Carl Danco rushes Steckler, swinging out wildly with a 
      fist like a lunchbox... Except that Tommy is in the middle... 
      Danco accidentally connects with Tommy s eye-socket... Tommy 
      goes down... Sheriff Conroy bellows:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    THAT.  IS.  ENOUGH!

    And everyone settles down... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Get up, son --

    And Tommy s eye looks like it s going to develop a healthy 
      shiner... Sheriff Conroy looks mildly disgusted... But then 
      Root Beer Rogers approaches Sheriff Conroy, radio in hand... 

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Hobbs got something, sir.  Out to 
                    Mac s Pond... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    The banner goes away.  The  Thaw 
                    Fest  is about corn dogs and 
                    carousels.  Ain t about darkness.  
                    The banner goes away...
                          (turns to Tommy)
                    Come on then --

      They walk off.  We LINGER ON John Haplin.  He is not pleased. 


      Tommy and Sheriff Conroy climb from the Welly, and begin to 
      walk across the ice... As they go:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    How s the eye?                                                                                    19.


                                  TOMMY
                    Better than it s gonna be in a few 
                    hours...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Your own damn fault --

                                  TOMMY
                    How you figure -- ?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    We ve had this conversation a 
                    million times.  You don t act like 
                    a cop.  You stand with your hands 
                    in your back pockets.  Instead of 
                    properly  blading   em.  Command 
                    presence. You act like you re 
                    selling ice cream... 

                                  TOMMY
                    You sound like Rachel.  This is 
                    Haplin.  Why make things difficult, 
                    when the world is offering this? *

    And he spreads his arms to include the level white plain of 
    the frozen lake, and the high blue vault of sky overhead... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Just know about the inevitability 
                    of the Vis Major...

                                  TOMMY
                    The what?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    The Vis Major.  It s a Latin term.  
                     A natural and unavoidable 
                      catastrophe that interrupts the 
                    expected course of events.   And
                    every life can expect a visit from 
                    the Vis Major...  

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah, well, I figure the trick is 
                    to avoid Major Vis.  Or Vis Major.  
                    Or whatever the hell it is.  For as 
                    long as possible...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    That is the trick.  I would tell 
                    that to Chloe, if ever I saw her 
                    again...                                                                                    20.


                                  TOMMY
                    What?  

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    What?

                                  TOMMY
                    Who s Chloe?

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Who?

                                  TOMMY
                    You just said--

    But before the Sheriff can answer, they have neared the ice 
      shack.   Where another Deputy - the large, African-American 
      KELVIN TOLLIVER, 35 - awaits them, near some EMTs... And a 
    few scared, sniffling KIDS... 

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER
                    These kids were skating... When 
                    they found him...

      From out of the shack, steps the irascible ROGER HOBBS, 53.  
    The Chief Deputy/Investigator, he is the Sheriff s number 2.

                                   ROGER HOBBS
                    You ain t gonna believe this, 
                    Griff...  

      Hobbs holds open the door for them.  Father and son approach.


      An enormous three-story, neo-Jacobean pile, up on a hill 
      overlooking town.  The house looks mostly exhausted - 
      crumbling gables, tarnished lead roof, a listing weathervane - 
      although the landscaping is bright and well-tended...

      Henley and Miranda Kirby pull into the circular drive...

                                    MIRANDA KIRBY
                    I really do think you ll be quite 
                      comfortable here... Until we can 
                    find you something more... 
                      Permanent.

      Henley nods.  She eyes the house, a little warily...


      KIDS and cars are scattered about this public school, erected 
      in the early 1930s.  Brick and bramble and clinging ivy... 


      It s a fetid cluster of tilting structures, surrounding a 
      MAIN HOUSE... This was clearly once a working farm... Only 
    now the pasture is a delta of mud;  the tower silo leans to 
    the left;  the machinery shed is missing its roof, etc.  

    All fronting - a half mile in the distance - the TOWN DUMP - 
    a veritable 30-acre landscape of dirt and discarded objects 
      atop of foundation of garbage and debris.                                                                                      37.


      Gulls circle and dive-bomb and caw their strident caws... A 
      pair of enormous EARTH-MOVERS gleam shiny yellow - as if they 
    are the only things in this blighted place that are lovingly 
      cleaned and tended-to...

      Tommy and Sheriff Conroy pull-up in the Crown Vic... 

                                  TOMMY
                    God, I hate these guys...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    You and the rest of the free world.

      They climb out of the car... A few chickens cluck and 
      scrabble in the dirt, avoiding the trio of nasty ROTTWEILERS 
      chained to a buried spike by the former sheep shelter...

    As Tommy and the Sheriff approach the front door, they see a 
      MAN, 24, chasing a piglet around the yard... He is called 
      BABY BOY, and he is mentally disabled, possessing the 
      guileless curiosity inherent in his condition. 

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Hello, Sheriff Griffin Conroy.  Top 
                    of them morning to you...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Top of them morning to you, too, 
                    Baby Boy... 

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Greggy is coming home soon from The 
                    Long Place, Deputy Thomas Conroy.  
                    Are you scared?

                                  TOMMY
                    Why should I be scared?  Greggy is 
                    gonna come out of penitentiary a 
                    proper citizen...

    And Baby Boy sniggers... Even he is not too slow to know 
      there s not a fucking chance of that...

      Tommy and Sheriff Conroy go around the back of the main 
      house, where they find the rest of the Stiviletto Brothers.  
    Who are:

    - RONALD STIVILETTO.  At 31, he is the putative leader, while 
    the oldest brother - GREGGY - is away at prison. 

    - LINCOLN STIVILETTO, 29.  A scrawny, weasel with a pinched 
      face and a nasty disposition...

    - WOMPER STIVILETTO, 27.  Enormously fat and mean and dirty.                                                                                    38.


    *** (A word about The Stiviletto Brothers.  Every town has - 
    and fears - a family like The Stiviletto Brothers.  They were 
      bullies in high school, piling up expulsions, DUIs, B&E 
      arrests, and if there was trouble to be had, they found it.  
    As adults, one would assume they are still up to no good.)

    As Tommy and the Sheriff approach... We see that the 
      Stiviletto Boys are building some kind of WOODEN TANK, like 
    the kind used in  dunk-the-clown  games at carnivals:  

      There is a seat, above a tank full of water... And softballs 
    are thrown at two targets on either side of the seat... It is 
      almost finished... A painted SIGN, with the letters  DUNK-THE-
      DIMWIT  across it, hangs on the side... 

    A keg is buried in a barrel of snow.  Stereo speakers in the 
      windows of a tractor shed blast some old-school metal (not 
      dissimilar to the Megadeth played in the ice shack)...

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Look... It s Sheriff Andy Taylor 
                    and his boy, Opie, come-a-calling!

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Whatchoo boys doing??

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    It s our contribution to the  Thaw 
                    Fest .  For 50 cents, you get three 
                    chances to  Dunk-The-Dimwit .
                          (gestures to Baby Boy)
                    And here s the dimwit!

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Well, that ain t particularly nice.

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    Also ain t particularly nowhere 
                    near your business --

                                  TOMMY
                    Why don t you settle down, Ronald?

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    Don t even fake you re a hard guy, 
                    T.C.  Your old man weren t the 
                    Sheriff, you d be working for us at 
                    the dump, shooting rats...

                                  WOMPER STIVILETTO
                    If he knew how to fire a gun...

    And they chortle, as their kind will...                                                                                     39.


                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Where were you boys last night?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    We were here...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    All night?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    All night.  

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Break it down for me...

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    Why should we--

    But his brother holds up a hand to quiet him...

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                      Eazy-peezy, Sheriff.  We were here 
                    all night.  Exceptin  for when 
                    Lincoln went into town to get a 
                    pizza from Big Dave s.  He come 
                    back.  We ate the pizza.  And then 
                    Ronald and Link worked on The 
                    Dunker.  And then Baby Boy watched 
                    a little reality television.  And 
                    then my girl, Kissy, came by and I 
                    made sweet love to her, while she 
                    read a movie magazine...

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    You had a problem with Jerry 
                    Friddle?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Nah, he was okay.  Other than he 
                    did a lot of around-town-pervin ...

      Sheriff Conroy nods... Then:

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Chloe know you re here?

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Who?  What?

    And Sheriff Conroy looks like he s momentarily lost his place 
    in a novel he was reading...

                                  TOMMY
                    Dad -- ?                                                                                    40.


      Sheriff Conroy blinks and he s back... Just as Baby Boy comes 
      around, climbing onto the seat in the  Dunk-A-Dimwit  tanks.

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Watch this, Conroy Men.  Watch me 
                    go, go, go!!!

      Sheriff Conroy would rather not... He turns to Ronald, as 
      Womper picks up two softballs... 

                                  SHERIFF CONROY
                    Don t leave town --

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    We never leave town...

      Womper whips a softball at the target.  It goes wide left. 

                                  BABY BOY STIVILETTO
                    Womper stinks!  Womper stinks!

      Sheriff Conroy and Tommy begin to walk away... And the 
      rottweilers start to bark their heads off... Straining their 
      chains, jaws slavered with foam... Lincoln calls after Tommy:

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    Hey, T.C.?  Greggy be gettin  out 
                    soon...

      Womper has tossed another ball... This one connects... And 
      Baby Boy gets dunked... The Rotts bark their heads off... 

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    He s gonna be two things when he 
                    does...

                                  TOMMY
                    And what s that, Lincoln?

                                  LINCOLN STIVILETTO
                    He s gonna be rested.  And he s 
                    gonna be mad...

      Lincoln grins and goes back to where his brothers carouse. 
    Off Tommy, suddenly certain there are bad things ahead --

                   END OF ACT FOUR*                                                                                    41.


                                        ACT FIVE*



      Henley walks past the various shops... PEOPLE are out on the 
      stroll... The town is dressed up for  Thaw Fest .  Henley 
      sees Miranda Kirby across the street, with her daughter, 
      JORDAN.  Jordan is on her knees, feeding their PUPPY the 
      crust from her slice of pizza... Miranda sees Henley and 
      waves...

      Henley walks on... Passing cheese shops and ice cream parlors 
      and a record store that actually sells vinyl...

      When she comes upon Merritt Grieves, standing in the doorway 
      of  THE HOUSE OF USHERS .  Which is clearly a MOVIE 
      MEMORABILIA SHOP, WHICH seems so out of place here, not only 
    in its wares, but in a sense of gloom that pervades it.

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Absurdly cheery here, isn t it?

    If she is surprised to see him, she hides it.  In fact, we 
    are not sure if this meeting is happenstance or well-planned.

                                  HENLEY
                    Hello.

                                  MERRITT GRIEVES
                    Come in.  Please --


    A huge COLONIAL MANSION of lush foliage, terraces and 
      verandas, pools and fountains.  An 800-foot canoe lake, 9-
      hole golf course, tennis courts, six-stall stable.  

    The view is breath-taking, even with the trees bare... And 
    the sprawling property is center-punched, oddly, with the 30- 
      FOOT LONG, 20-FOOT HIGH SECTION OF 17TH CENTURY DRY-STONE 
      WALL, that gives the property its name...

    The SUV takes them past the residence and toward a free- 
      standing ICE RINK in the middle of the grounds...  

      Tommy can see the LONE FIGURE skating a precarious figure-8 
    in the center of the rink...  

    The SUV comes to a stop... Haplin turns to Tommy...

                                  JOHN HAPLIN
                    She d like to meet in private...

                                  TOMMY
                    I ll see ya, John.

      Tommy exits the vehicle and heads towards the skating rink.  
    The lone figure glides to the lip of the rink to greet him... 

      This is PEGGY HAPLIN, late-70s, the town matriarch.  Hers is 
    an august bearing, a leonine elegance both austere and 
      impenetrable, but still possessing a certainty and confidence 
      which belies her age and the tentative way she skates...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Deputy Conroy.

                                  TOMMY
                    Mrs. Haplin.

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    Let me get a look at you...

      She studies Tommy, who hates this kind of thing...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    You are your mother s son, aren t 
                    you?

                                  TOMMY
                    That s what people say.                                                                                    63.


                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    It s high praise.  She had a strong 
                    composition.  And was one of the 
                    best we ever had at Weeping Wall...

                                  TOMMY
                    She liked working here.  Always 
                    came home with a smile...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN 
                    Her facility with perennials was 
                    uncanny.  The gardens have never 
                    been the same since we lost her... 

    We now see the dynamic unfolding:  Tommy is bred from the 
       downstairs  contingency of Haplin County that serves at the 
      will of Peggy Haplin s  upstairs  command...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    And now, this with your father.  
                    It s heartbreaking...

                                  TOMMY
                    Yes, ma am.  It is... Unexpected.

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    And ill-timed.  With the incident 
                    at the pond...

    She looks at him... Tommy nods... 

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Walk with me... 

    And he climbs under the fence-post... And walks with Peggy 
      Haplin, while she slowly skates...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    You still play hockey?

                                  TOMMY
                    Not so much anymore.  Big Dave and 
                    I go down to the rink once in a 
                    while and slap a bag of pucks... 

      Peggy Haplin nods... Skates on... 

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    The good work your father has done 
                    for this county - for me -  during 
                    his tenure... It s needed now more 
                    than ever...                                                                                      64.


                                  TOMMY
                    Roger Hobbs is a pretty capable 
                    guy.  He was a cop in the Twin 
                    Cities before he came to Haplin...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Roger Hobbs mooches the stem.  He 
                    couldn t solve the mystery of the 
                    cheese sandwich if you showed him 
                    the pumpernickel and the provolone.

      And this is said with a savage bitterness... Tommy looks at 
      her... Peggy Haplin gathers herself... Smiles sweetly for:

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Which is why, until Griffin gets 
                    his right back:  I would like you 
                    to take over as Acting Sheriff of 
                    Haplin County...

    And Tommy couldn t look more surprised --

                                  TOMMY
                    Me?

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    I m effecting you as of this 
                      discussion...

    And she executes a little butterfly spin... 

                                  TOMMY
                    With all due respect, Mrs. Haplin: 
                    I m just a four-year Deputy.  And 
                    I m certainly not my father...

      Tommy searches for a way to get out of this...

                                  TOMMY
                    And there s a a chain of command.  
                    Hobbs is Chief Deputy and-- 

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    Roger Hobbs mooches the stem --

                                  TOMMY
                    I don t know what that means!

      Stated a little more forcefully than one speaks to the grand 
      lady... She merely smiles...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    It means:  I think you ll be great.                                                                                    65.


                                  TOMMY
                    What about John?  Your son is not a 
                    big fan of my father.  I don t see 
                    him sitting easy with another 
                    Conroy being perched...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    My son is an obsessive.  And though 
                    I share his agony over the 
                      disappearance of my granddaughter, 
                    his choice to fixate on The Magic 
                    Man has not only hurt the spirit of 
                    this community, it has rendered him 
                    an irrelevance.  Particularly at 
                    this moment of crossroad...

      Tommy clenches.  He can only speak the truth...

                                  TOMMY
                    I think you re making a mistake 
                    here...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN
                    And I think you can shift in your 
                    shoes all afternoon, young man.  
                    But I m an old lady accustomed to 
                    standing in the cold.  So I would 
                    suggest you do like your daddy did, 
                    and remind yourself whose founding 
                    capital pays for the apricots in 
                    your little girl s lunch pail...  

    She is not to be trifled with.  And Tommy gets it.  At last, 
    he nods... She eases.  Comforted by the victory...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (CONT D)
                    Good Luck.  Sheriff.

      With that, she skates off... Tommy watches Peggy Haplin 
      resume her figure-8s, thinking back to a mere two days ago.  
      When life was vastly simpler...

                       END OF ACT EIGHT*



                      

                                                                                                        66.


                        ACT NINE*


      Into the cool night air... But again, the ground is buckling, 
      canting, as if her entire vestibular system has shut-down...

    She turns... To look back into the hospital lobby... She can 
    see Handsome Sam... Still in the elevator... Keeping the door 
      from closing... Watching her... And she HEARS:

                                  HANDSOME SAM (SINGING;  O.S.)
                     I had some dreams/They were clouds 
                    in my coffee/Clouds in my coffee.. 

      Yep.  Carly Simon.  Georgia trips up... She sifts to the 
      ground... With nary a sound...                                                                                     70.


    It is only then that Handsome Sam exits the elevator... He 
      moves towards her... With those signature steady steps...

    He stands over her... Observes her... She looks up at him... 
    At his kind face... Those concerned eyes... Those unmoving 
      lips, which don t explain why she HEARS:

                                  HANDSOME SAM (SINGING;  O.S.)
                     You re so vain/You probably think 
                    this song is about you...  

    And Georgia gets to her feet.  And she runs.  Fast.  Away 
      from him.  As fast as she can possibly go... And as she does, 
      everything seems to waver... Not FADING... But DRIFTING --

    TO BLACK

      Over which, hyperkinetic, OVERLAPPING VOICES shuffle and 
      twist their way into our aural passage... Volume and pitch 
      fluctuate... Handsome Sam s singing, discordant and off-key, 
      CROSS-FADES, as we SNAP OUT OF BLACK to --

    AN OLD-SCHOOL TURNTABLE.  

    A vinyl record spinning on it.  Playing the actual Carly 
      Simon recording... And then we are looking up, from the 
      ground, to --

      Ronald, Lincoln and Womper Stiviletto.  For we are in --


      Actually, it s dawn.  The night has passed.  Georgia looks 
      out, to the dump, in the distance, lit by a pale, amber glow.

      Georgia gets slowly to her feet... And she begins to run... 
    Not quite sure where she is going... She looks behind her... 
      Because the Stiviletto Boys are giving chase... 

    Her heart THUMPS.  As she runs.  Toward the dump.  Turbid and 
      confused.  As they follow.  Laughing...

      Georgia comes to a stop.  At the edge of the dump.  Staring 
      out... She looks behind her.  But The Stiviletto Brothers are 
    no longer about... She looks back to the dump --

    Her face is lucent with the shimmering flicker of a debased 
      light... And then we see what she sees --

      Like something out of a Flemish painting.  Beyond the dump is 
    A VALLEY of great breadth and depth, a nameless gloom, with 
      globes of black and red FLAMES rising out of the stinking 
      pit...

    We can hear rustling CRIES.  Like souls undergoing torment.  
    We can smell the smoke... And, in the distance, there are 
      opal towers and sapphire battlements...

    And the awful firelight dances, a twisting, guttering pyre.

    And Georgia SCREAMS.*

                                        ACT TEN*



      Root Beer Rogers waits here, as Tommy slams his Welly to a 
      stop and bursts from the car... 

                                  ROOT BEER ROGERS
                    Got your message.  What s up, boss?  
                    We making an arrest?

                                  TOMMY
                    No.  Not an arrest.

    And Tommy hands Root Beer his badge.  And his gun.

                                  TOMMY
                    Not an arrest...

    And before Root Beer can even ask --


      Long shadows stretch across this well-kept lawn... A woman, 
      DORIS, old and rimpled, answers her front door, her face 
      immediately brightening when she sees Tommy...  

                                  DORIS
                    Tommy -- !

                                  TOMMY
                    Hey, there... He home?                                                                                    79.


                                  DORIS
                    No.  I expect him soon for supper, 
                    though... 

                                  TOMMY
                    No worries.  I just wanted to grab 
                    my drill gun... I can come back... *

                                  DORIS
                    Don t be silly... It s in the 
                      basement... You know the way...

    And as Doris lets Tommy in, we can see, by the expression on 
    his face, that this is exactly what he wanted.


      Town Square is all dressed-up for festival.  Beneath the 
       Remember To Never Forget  banner.  As it flies, high over 
      The Thaw Fest, just getting underway...

      The whole community has turned out.  

      The booths are thriving.  The farrago swirl of candied apples 
      and corn dogs and cotton candy freight the air... There are 
      FORTUNE TELLERS, JUGGLERS, MAGICIANS, etc.

      Calliope keens wrestle with the squeals of joyful children in 
    a scrum of pure Americana... The carousel glistens... The 
      Sunday CLOWNS make animal balloons...

      It is the NINTH GRADE GLEE CLUB, on the riser, singing 
       SATURDAY IN THE PARK  ( Can you dig it - yes, I can/And I ve 
      been waiting such a long time/For Saturday...  )...

      Henley walks through the festivities... Looking, all the 
      world, like a lost child... When, at once, there is Miranda 
      Kirby, her daughter, JORDAN, 9 and adorable and holding a 
      stuffed walrus  --

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Henley!  This is my Jordan.  And 
                    this her walrus, Wally.  Jords, 
                    this is Henley, who I told you 
                    about... The real guitar hero.

                                  HENLEY
                          (to Jordan)
                    Hello --

                                  JORDAN KIRBY
                    Hi...                                                                                    85.


                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Your first  Thaw Fest !  Are you 
                    having fun?

                                  HENLEY
                    It s great...

      Miranda is subsumed by the LADIES from the Garden Club... 
      Henley wanders away... To where Dot Manning and The Widows 
    are laying waste to the fried dough stand...Henley clocks the 
    lot of them, suitably preoccupied...

    Her time to go.  She starts to leave --


      Tommy and Big Dave pull up in the Welly... They climb from 
    the car... Tommy clocks the banner... Hanging high... His 
      scowl is apparent... He turns to Big Dave and barks:

                                  TOMMY
                    Stay close.  And let s just act  *
                    normal until we can figure this  *
                    out...*

    As Tommy enters the  Thaw Fest , he and Henley cross... There 
    is a look, a moment, albeit a brief one...  But then his 
      attention is drawn to --

    THE DUNK-A-DIMWIT

    The Stiviletto Brothers  contribution to all of this... Baby 
    Boy sits in the tank... Ronald, Womper, Lincoln hawking 
       three tries for a buck ...

      Tommy and Ronald share a dark glance... But before things can 
    get urgent:

                                  RACHEL CONROY (O.S.)
                    Where have you been?

      Tommy turns to his wife... 

                                  TOMMY
                    Just... All of a sudden... Stuff.

      Rachel kisses him...

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Happy  Thaw Fest , T.C...

    He nods... Clearly mad-distracted...                                                                                    86.


                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Your father is going to be fine...

                                  TOMMY
                    I know.

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Remember how, when we were kids, we 
                    used to hide from him every  Thaw 
                    Fest ?

      Tommy nods... She looks at him... He is clearly upset... She 
      touches his face... 

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    You okay, baby?

    He nods.  His eyes say otherwise.  She attempts to cheer him:

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                    Starting to warm-up.  Maybe you 
                    will get the  Dallas Alice  in the 
                    water after all...

                                  TOMMY
                    Where s Emma C.?

                                  RACHEL CONROY
                      Stockpiling goldfish...

      She gestures... To a booth... Where you throw a ring-toss and 
      win goldfish... Emma is tossing, Georgia with her...

                                  TOMMY
                    Keep an eye...

      And he walks away... And Rachel frowns after him...

      GEORGIA

      cheerleads Emma s tosses...

                                    GEORGIA
                    You go, Li l Bean.  You da man.

      When Andrew Haplin appears... To Emma:

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    It s all in the wrist, Em.  All in 
                    the wrist...

      Emma blushes... Clearly this older, cute boy has an effect.  
      Even on a 9-year-old...                                                                                    87.


                                  EMMA CONROY
                    Okay...

      Andrew notices the scrape on Georgia s face.  This 
      conversation is hushed, out of Emma s ear-shot and without 
      looking at each other, so to a casual observer they are 
      merely standing near each other --

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    What happened?

                                  GEORGIA
                    It s nothing.

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    Did your father do that?

    She considers what exactly to tell him.  Then:

                                  GEORGIA
                    Yeah.  He was on a real bender last 
                    night...

                                  ANDREW HAPLIN
                    I m gonna kill that guy, I swear...

                                  GEORGIA
                    It ll be fine, it ll be fine.

    But maybe it won t be.  Especially as we see --

      TOMMY

    On the other side of the park, keeping the peek on the 
      Stiviletto Brothers... When --

      HANDSOME SAM

    is at his side...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Sheriff Conroy?

    And Tommy is clearly not comfortable with this title...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Sam Dunning.  I work with Captain 
                    Frost.  State Police.  And I am 
                    here to help...

                                  TOMMY
                    You work with Frost?                                                                                    88.


                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    I do.  And I am here to help.

                                  TOMMY
                    Surprised the Captain hasn t paid 
                    us a visit himself.  Back in the 
                    day, he was a major presence...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    He sent me.  And I am here to help.

                                  TOMMY
                    You said that...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    How s your father?

                                  TOMMY
                    At this point:  we don t know...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    I am here as a resource.  We will 
                    get to the bottom of this.  Not 
                    here to step on toes.  Most of all 
                    not yours.  But we will find this 
                    guy.  A homicide.  We don t get a 
                    lot of them.  When we do... We are 
                      snap-sharp...

      Tommy looks at him... 

                                  TOMMY
                      Snap-sharp.

      Handsome Sam nods...

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                      Snap-sharp.

    We can see Tommy isn t happy with the appearance of this man, 
      seeing as how his best friend is the culprit.  And we aren t 
      quite sure what this man s involvement was in Georgia s 
      nightmare at the hospital...

                             ACT TWELVE*


      To resume.  There is the SQUEAL of FEEDBACK, and --

      PEGGY HAPLIN 

      is on the stage... At the mike, John Haplin behind her:

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (AMPLIFIED)
                    Hello.  Hello, everyone.  I am 
                    going to make this brief... So 
                    everyone can get back to the 
                    business at hand:  which is having 
                    a ball at, believe it or not, the 
                    53rd Annual Haplin County  Thaw 
                    Fest !

      There is a burst of applause and cheers... Womper Stiviletto 
      two-finger whistles...

                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (AMPLIFIED)
                    I remember my Daddy taking me to  -
                    and now I m giving away information 
                    I shouldn t - the very first  Thaw 
                    Fest ...
                          (laughter)
                    And I won a stuffed walrus.  I 
                    still have that stuffed walrus.  
                    Although he hasn t aged as well as 
                    I have... !

      There is more laughter... Doctor Pete sidles up to Tommy:

                                  DOCTOR PETE
                    Think she mentions the murder?

                                  TOMMY
                    Not a chance...

      When Ronald Stiviletto walks by:

                                  RONALD STIVILETTO
                    Hey, Tommy!  Wanna give it a go?  
                    Three tries for a buck?  Proceeds 
                    go to Baby Boy s college education!

      He s holding three softballs... Womper and Lincoln hoot and 
      holler from beside  Dunk-A-Dimwit ...

      Tommy turns away from them... He looks up to where Peggy 
      Haplin is finishing up:                                                                                    90.


                                  PEGGY HAPLIN (AMPLIFIED)
                    Anyhow.  Have fun.  Eat, drink, win 
                    walruses, and generally rejoice in 
                    the myriad pleasures of living here 
                    in Haplin... Thank-you!

    Big applause... Tommy and Doctor Pete share a look... Tommy 
      nods... Emma runs up to him...

                                  EMMA CONROY
                    I won!  I won a dragon!

    And she shows him the stuffed dragon... And Georgia trails 
      her... And she sees Handsome Sam... She appears most rattled.  
      Especially when he offers her a placed:

                                  HANDSOME SAM
                    Hello -- 

    But before Georgia can respond, Kelvin Tolliver approaches... 

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER
                    Trouble --

    And he gestures... To where a pick-up truck has pulled up to 
    the entrance to the park... And out steps Carl Danco, the 
      disgruntled Bready line foreman...

      He s with a 7 equally ANGRY MEN... Most of them African-
      American... They march to the ropes securing the banner... 
    And begin to tear it down... 

      Perry Steckler and some of the other Haplin MEN try and 
      intervene... And, in seconds, there s a full-on skirmish 
      erupting... And Tommy, Kelvin and Root Beer run over, to 
      break it up... Tommy wrests Danco away --

                                  CARL DANCO
                    This has got to stop!  They are 
                    flying that thing, it is like they 
                    are spitting in the face of little 
                    Chad Sorrell!  Do you get that?  Do 
                    you see that?  Do you?

    And one of Danco s men takes a swing at one of Steckler s 
      men... And the upheaval takes a more dire bent... Fists are 
      flying... Children are crying... Angry shouting and shoving, 
      Root Beer and Kelvin are jostled and pushed...

      When, at once, Tommy hears a voice.  Above the din.  A 
      panicked voice.  And Miranda Walsh appears.  And she looks 
      singularly crazed...                                                                                    91.


                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    Jordan?  Jordan, where are you? 
                    JORDAN?  JORDAN???

    All eyes are on her... Nervous chatter... When she stops.  
      Bends down.  And lets out A WAIL.  A high, terrified PULING --

    For she is holding the stuffed walrus, Wally...

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    JORDANNNNNN!!!!

    As we MOVE IN ON Tommy... And, in absurd counterpoint, the 
      jaunty piano and horn section OPENING of Chicago s  SATURDAY 
      IN THE PARK  fades up... ( Saturday in the park/I think it 
      was the 4th of July , etc.)

      As everyone looks around... True panic setting in... Tommy 
      looks over at Rachel... At Emma...

      Bedlam ensues... Tommy looks at Root Beer and Kelvin... At 
      Peggy Haplin... At John Haplin... At The Stiviletto Brothers 
      as, oddly unmindful, Lincoln winds up and tosses a softball 
      at the target of the  Dunk-A-Dimwit ... This one connects... 
      And Baby Boy is dropped into the water tank...

      Miranda continues to wail... Everyone seems to be looking to 
      Tommy:  Georgia, Andrew Haplin, Dot Manning, Carl Danco, 
      Perry Steckler... CUT TO:


      CONTINUE MUSIC.  As MOTHERS grab their CHILDREN.  As Kelvin 
    and Root Beer try and keep the peace... 


      CONTINUE MUSIC.  As FAMILIES run for their cars.  And a 
      hysterical Miranda Kirby rushes up to Tommy --

                                  MIRANDA KIRBY
                    What are you going to do?  What are 
                    you going to do?  WHAT ARE YOU 
                    GOING TO DO?  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO 
                    DO???


      CONTINUE MUSIC.  Emma runs into Tommy s arms... He holds her 
      tight... Looking at Rachel... And we HEAR:                                                                                    93.


                                  SHERIFF CONROY (O.S.)
                    He ll be back.  Now that blood s 
                    been spilled again.  Everything 
                    will unravel.  And he ll be back.

    As Tommy holds his daughter, he looks across the violent 
      swirl of panic that the  Thaw Fest  has become --

    To find Big Dave.  Their eyes lock.  Big Dave looks lost.  
      Lost and scared and terribly mistaken... And WE HEAR:

                                  DONNA FRIDDLE (O.S.)
                    One thing you can count on:  The 
                    Magic Man?  He s somebody you 
                    passed by on the street today...

    And Kelvin and Root Beer walk up to Tommy... *

                                  KELVIN TOLLIVER*
                    What are we gonna do, T.C. -- ? *

    He looks at them.  Considers.  Then he takes something from  *
    his pocket.  Looks at it.  It s the SHERIFF S STAR.*

    And Tommy pins it onto his chest.  He turns to them -- *

                                  TOMMY*
                    We re gonna find that little girl.*

      They look at him.  As if seeing him for the first time.   *
      Which, in a sense, they are --*

      And, off Tommy, fully aware that everything he has known up  *
      till now is forever changed, we CUT TO:


      CONTINUE MUSIC.  We begin at the banks of the pond.  As a 
      crack forms on the ice.  The thaw finally taking hold...

      And we FOLLOW THE CRACK.  As it spider-webs across the 
      surface of the pond.  Filament striations radiating from the 
      seam of the main crack...

      We FOLLOW IT... OUT TO THE CENTER OF THE ICE...  

      Still the joyful tune PLAYS ON ( People reaching/People 
      touching/A real celebration/Waiting for us all...  )...

      As the crack leads up to Raymond Manning s ICE SHACK... ( If 
    we want it, really want it/Can you dig it...  ) 

      Its interior lit with a lantern glow... ( yes, I can...  )                                                                                    94.


    As a SHADOWY FIGURE ENTERS... Dragging another FIGURE.  A 
      much smaller figure... ( And I ve been waiting such a long 
      time/For the day... ) 

      ... Closing the door behind the both of them.

      And we can see, in the pearlescent glow of the FULL MOON, now 
      skidding across the night sky, as if it, too, were melting, 
      like a tatter of butter in a skillet:

      The DOOR to the Manning ice shack.  Because we hadn t noticed 
      it before.  The color of the door...

    For it is blue.        

                            THE END
