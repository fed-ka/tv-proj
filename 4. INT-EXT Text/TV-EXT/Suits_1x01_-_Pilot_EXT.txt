  We pan across the water to the facade of a gorgeous office 
    complex at the southern tip of the city.  The offices in the 
    building are all dark.  Except one.  We ZOOM IN:   


    The unit s barely larger than the table at the law firm.  
    Mike is asleep on a pullout that takes up the entire place.   
  An alarm rings.  Mike hits snooze and goes back to sleep.   


    Mike, clean cut and wearing a suit, grabs the briefcase and 
    heads for the door.  Jenny enters.  Mike is startled.   

                                MIKE
                  You scared the hell out of me.

                                JENNY
                  Sorry.  Look at you.  You look great.  
                  Tell me you decided to work with Trevor.

                                MIKE
                  Trial basis.  What are you doing here?

                                JENNY
                  Wanna hear something ridiculous?  My mom 
                  is coming by my place later and I don t 
                  want to mess it up, so I m hanging here.

                                MIKE
                  That s not so bad.

                                JENNY
                  That s not the ridiculous part.  After I 
                  finish scouring the place for her visit, 
                  I sprinkle a tee-nybit of crumbs around.  

                                MIKE
                  Why?

                                JENNY
                  Because I don t want her to think I scour 
                  the place just for her visit.

                                MIKE
                  That is ridiculous.

                                JENNY
                  I know.  That s what I just said.

    Mike and Jenny share a smile.  He starts out, she stops him.  

                                JENNY
                  You want to look perfect your first day. 

    Jenny fixes Mike s tie, it s very intimate.  She finishes, 
    noticing he s staring at her.  A moment, then: 

                                JENNY
                  Do you ever wonder what would have 
                  happened if you and I had met first?        A Legal Mind                                            19. 



                                MIKE
                        (beat)
                  I ve got to go.


    The plane takes off as we hear the flight attendant.

                                FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.)
                  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Delta 
                  Flight 96 with direct service to Boston.


    Twenty people with name tags are in front of a sign:  Harvard 
    Law School Tour.   Mike sees a very cocky-looking YOUNG MAN 
  by himself.  Mike approaches and reads his name tag...      

                                MIKE
                  Clifford Watkins?   

                                CLIFFORD WATKINS
                        (air of superiority)
                  Can I help you?

                                MIKE
                  My name is Jonathan Atwater, I work for 
                  Dean Wormer in the admissions office.

    Clifford s attitude instantly changes.

                                CLIFFORD WATKINS
                  Yes, of course, what can I --

                                MIKE
                  Dean Wormer personally sent me to invite 
                  you to an intimate cocktail hour for some 
                  of our more... realisticcandidates.

    Clifford surveys the people around him and smiles knowingly.

                                MIKE
                  We d like to be discreet, so if you d be 
                  so kind as to subtly hand me your name 
                  tag you can proceed to the Dean s office.

    Clifford smiles smugly, hands Mike his name tag and exits.  
  As Mike dons Clifford s name tag, a YOUNG WOMAN approaches.  
  As she starts the tour, Mike follows, taking in Harvard...

                                YOUNG WOMAN
                  Harvard Law is the oldest law school in 
                  the country and boasts the most 
                  successful graduates in the world.

                                        ACT THREE


    Mike comes up from the subway with an excitement in his step 
    that only comes on the first day of a new career.  His cell 
    rings, it s Trevor again.  He silences it and keeps walking.     


    Mike opens an envelope, reads it and quickly heads off...


    Harvey eats with VANESSA, a gorgeous woman in a killer dress.

                                HARVEY
                  So, we get there and my client decides 
                  it ll be funny to introduce me to his 
                  pastoras a recovering sexaddict.

                                VANESSA
                  What did you do?

                                HARVEY
                  I hold out my hand to the pastor and go, 
                   Who said anything about recovering? 

    Vanessa laughs.  They share a moment... then:

                                VANESSA
                  I believe you have something for me?

                                HARVEY
                  That s what I love about you, Vanessa.  
                  Business over pleasure.  

    Harvey puts the envelope of cash Donna gave him on the table.  

                                HARVEY
                  By the way, that dress... damn.

                                VANESSA
                  This old thing?  It was my father s.

    Vanessa counts the money in the envelope and puts it away.

                                HARVEY
                  Vanessa, how come you and I never...

                                VANESSA
                  Because I don t sleep around.  And I 
                  could never have a relationship with you.    
                  All you ever think about is yourself.

                                HARVEY
                  That s ridiculous.  I m thinking about 
                  you and me right now.

    Vanessa smiles and shakes her head as she gets up to leave.        A Legal Mind                                            54. 



                                HARVEY
                  By the way, I m not selfish everywhere.

                                VANESSA
                  Neither am I.  But you ll never know it.

    Vanessa hands Harvey a manila folder and heads off.  Harvey 
    watches her go, then looks opens the folder and looks inside. 


    Mike stands as Harvey peruses his handiwork.  

                                HARVEY
                  This is good.  We re gonnahave some fun.

                                MIKE
                  Did... you say we?

                                HARVEY
                  You didn t think I was going to let you 
                  come along?

                                MIKE
                  No.

                                HARVEY
                  Good instinct, I wasn t.  Then I thought 
                  it would be cruel not to let you witness 
                  my greatness.

    Mike smiles.

                                MIKE
                  You re a true giver.


    Harvey, Mike and DEFENSE COUNSEL are arguing the motion to 
    dismiss in front of a JUDGE, BAILIFF and STENOGRAPHER... 

                                DEFENSE COUNSEL
                  Your honor, this case should be thrown 
                  out.  Other than her story, plaintiff 
                  doesn't have one piece of evidence.

                                HARVEY
                  Because the evidence lies within their 
                  personnel files, which they re 
                  conveniently refusing to hand over.        A Legal Mind                                            55. 



                                DEFENSE COUNSEL
                  Those files have sensitive information. 
                  He's fishing at the expense of our 
                  employees  right to privacy.

    Harvey scoffs.

                                HARVEY
                  Please, he doesn't give a rat's ass about 
                  his employees' right to privacy.  

                                DEFENSE COUNSEL
                  Your honor, Mr. Specter s claim that we 
                  don t care about our employees, though 
                  witty, carries no weight as a rule of law.

                                HARVEY
                  True.  But what does carry weight is that 
                  under Article Seven of the statute, the 
                  investigation of sexual harassment must 
                  be conducted without any duress.  

                                JUDGE
                  Your point? 

    Harvey walks the courtroom with ease as he makes his case.

                                HARVEY
                  Both the investigator and every person 
                  interviewed answers to the CEO they're 
                    investigating.  That is the definition of 
                  duress.  It d be like your bailiff accused 
                  you of sexual harassment, and you assigned 
                  your stenographer to investigate.  How 
                  likely do you think it would be that the 
                  investigation yielded any fruit?

                                JUDGE
                  You honestly think I would harass Herman?

    Harvey looks at the bailiff, a slovenly, fifty year old man.  

                                HARVEY
                  I don t know, your honor.  Some people 
                  have a thing for the uniform...

                                JUDGE
                  I d like to think Herman would come to me  
                  before it got to an investigation.

    Harvey glances at Herman.  Herman shakes his head no.

                                DEFENSE COUNSEL
                  I saw that.  That should be stricken.        A Legal Mind                                            56. 



    Harvey smiles, then continues to the Judge.

                                HARVEY
                  And what if Herman did come to you, your 
                  honor?  And you betrayed his trust by 
                  firing him under false pretenses?

                                JUDGE
                  You really think that little of me?

                                HARVEY
                  I wouldn t trust you as far as I could 
                  throw you, your honor.

    They share a smile.  

                                JUDGE
                  Your point is taken.

                                DEFENSE COUNSEL
                  Your honor --

                                JUDGE
                  Hand over the files. 

    Mike beams with their victory.  The Judge addresses Harvey.

                                JUDGE
                  But this doesn't go on forever.  You've 
                  got one week to show me evidence backing 
                  up your claim or I'm dismissing the suit.  

                                HARVEY
                  But, your honor --

                                JUDGE
                  That s it, I ve made my ruling, now Herman 
                  and I have some communicating to do.

    Mike turns to Harvey.

                                MIKE
                  That was awesome.

                                HARVEY
                  It was your argument.  I just framed it 
                  in a way that humanized the situation and 
                  brightened all of our afternoons.

                                MIKE
                  I feel like Michael Corleonein that 
                  scene where the fat guy teaches him how 
                  to shoot the gun.        A Legal Mind                                            57. 



                                HARVEY
                  Are you saying I m the fat guy?
                        (then)
                  I am not the fat guy.


    Mike exits quickly.  He sees Rene prancing toward the front 
    window holding ten thousand dollars of clothing.  Mike smiles 
  to himself at his getaway.  His cell phone rings, he answers.

                                JENNY
                  Mike, it s Jenny.

                                MIKE
                  Trevor s having you do his dirty work?        A Legal Mind                                            58. 



                                JENNY
                  Trevor doesn t even know I m calling you.  
                  And all I know is that you re not talking 
                  to each other and I miss you and I want 
                  things to go back to the way they were.

    This stops Mike short.  

                                MIKE
                  I miss you too.  But I don t think things 
                  are ever going back the way they were.

    Mike hangs up the phone.


    Mike enters.  He s been up all night and all the next day.

                                MIKE
                  I know where they don t want us to look.

                                HARVEY
                  You got through those files by yourself 
                  in a day and a half?

                                MIKE
                  I would have done it faster, but I 
                  ordered a pizza.  Have you tried that 
                  Papa John s crazy bread?  It s fantastic.
                        (off look, coming clean)
                  Rachel helped me.  Half the files were 
                  men.  Another chunk were women over 
                  sixty.  I read the rest.

    Harvey smiles at Mike trying to pull one over on him.

                                MIKE
                  Come on, it s still impressive!

                                HARVEY
                  What did you find?

                                MIKE
                  We pieced together from the records there 
                  was a dismissal on March 12, 2002.  But 
                  the file containing the employee name is 
                  missing.  That s our woman, I know it.  
                  I m moving to slap monetary sanctions on 
                  their attorney, possible jail time... 
                  this guy isn t gonnaknow what hit him.

    A beat.  Harvey dials his phone.  It rings on speaker.  

                                HARVEY
                  Phil, it s Harvey Specter.  Did you have 
                  anything to do with the March 12th, 2002 
                  files being left out of discovery?        A Legal Mind                                            62. 



                                PHIL (ON SPEAKER)
                  No.

                                HARVEY
                  If the file is here by noon, I ll believe 
                  you, if not we re filing for sanctions... 

    Harvey hangs up the phone and looks at Mike.

                                HARVEY
                  Threat of sanctions is better than filing 
                  for sanctions.

                                MIKE
                  That s what I meant.  I was going to 
                  threaten him.  Not file.  I meant that.


    Mike is dressed.  He goes to the oven, opens it, takes out 
    the briefcase, and heads out to work with it...        A Legal Mind                                            67. 




    Mike runs up to Joanna, who keeps walking...

                                MIKE
                  Joanna, wait...

                                JOANNA
                  This is why I didn t want to testify.  
                  They twist some thing from a hundred 
                  years ago and make me look like a liar.

    She turns to Mike.

                                JOANNA
                  They make it sound like what he did to me 
                  didn t happen.

                                MIKE
                  Look, I know it was hard.  But it doesn t 
                  matter what happened in there.  I need 
                  you to have the courage to give testimony 
                  to the Judge on Friday to keep this case 
                  alive.  I don t have time to find someone 
                  else between now and then...        A Legal Mind                                            72. 



    She looks at him, then starts walking again...

                                MIKE
                  Wait --

                                JOANNA
                  No.  I m not waiting.  You promised me 
                  this wouldn t happen and it did.

                                MIKE
                  You never told me you were arrested.

                                JOANNA
                  Please don t contact me again.

    Mike watches as his chance to win walks away.


    Katherine rings Phillip s doorbell.  He answers.


    Harvey s at his desk.  Mike enters, sheepishly.  Harvey 
    smiles.  

                                HARVEY
                  I see you came to work today.  Nice suit.

                                MIKE
                  It was a barter transaction.  I got 
                  twelve of them for one little briefcase.

    Harvey smiles.  He s proud of Mike.  Mike gets serious.

                                MIKE
                  Listen, I m sorry and --

                                HARVEY
                  Forget it.  When I started, Katherine 
                  rode me so hard, I quit once a month.  I 
                  just told you what you needed to hear.

    Mike still needs to say what he was going to say...

                                MIKE
                  That s just it.  When I was ten my mom 
                  and dad died in a car accident.  After a 
                  thing like that, you don t trust anything 
                  or anyone.  Except my Grammy.  She raised 
                  me, she did the best she could...     

    Mike takes a deep breath and gets emotional.        A Legal Mind                                            80. 



                                MIKE
                  She always told me what I needed to hear.  

    Mike looks at Harvey.

                                MIKE
                  I guess it s time I trusted someone else.    

    A moment.  Harvey is moved.  He tosses Mike a file.

                                HARVEY
                  Merry Christmas.

    Mike looks through the file, absorbs it contents, then:  

                                MIKE
                  What would you have done with this if I 
                  hadn t come in today?

                                HARVEY
                  I d have used it myself.

    Harvey lets it sink in that if Mike hadn t come in today, 
    Harvey wouldn t have tracked him down.  Then:

                                HARVEY
                  You know what to do?

                                MIKE
                  Yeah.  Press until it hurts.


    Harvey and Mike walk out of the courthouse.

                                MIKE
                  Okay, I just have one question, why did 
                  you go to Joanna Webster s house?

                                HARVEY
                  Because I figured it out.

                                MIKE
                  I think you did it because you cared 
                  about me.

                                HARVEY
                  I did it because it s my job.        A Legal Mind                                            83. 



                                MIKE
                  Admit it, you cared.  I saw the smile on 
                  your face when I showed up this morning.

                                HARVEY
                  I didn t smile.

                                MIKE 
                  Say what you want.  You know it, and I 
                  know it, you smiled.

    A beat.

                                HARVEY 
                  I was thinking of a funny joke.
