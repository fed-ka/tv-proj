Snowy suburbs of Toronto. From a nondescript house we hear:
KIM PINE (O.S.)
Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?
An eager Knives stands outside. Scott opens the door a crack.
SCOTT
You promise to be good?
KNIVES CHAU
Of course I'll be good!
SCOTT
No, really. Please be good.
KNIVES CHAU
Am I normally not?
Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.
SCOTT
Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen
Stills. He's the talent.
STEPHEN STILLS
Hey.
STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives.
STEPHEN STILLS
Is she gonna geek out on us?
SCOTT
She'll just sit in the corner, man.
STEPHEN STILLS
I mean, I want her to geek out on us.
SCOTT
She'll geek. She geeks. She has the
capacity to geek.

Scott bids adieu to a stunned Knives as she gets on a bus.
KNIVES CHAU
I can't even...Sex Bob-Omb.
Amazing.
Wallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL.
Uniformed boys and girls pour out.
WALLACE
I do not want to be here. At all.
SCOTT
This school has boys too.
WALLACE
I hate you. Even I would think twice
about dating a seventeen year old.
SCOTT
Well, she's only allowed out when
the sun is up, so I wouldn't call
it dating, more like...

KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
Scott! Heyyyy!
Knives skips to Scott. Her shy friend TAMARA lingers behind.
SCOTT
Hey Knives, this is my cool gay
roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.
KNIVES CHAU
Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in
my class is gay?
WALLACE
Yes. Does he wear glasses?
SCOTT
Wallace, you go now! Begone!
Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.
WALLACE
You're too good for him. Run.
Scott and Knives leave a pizza joint, slices in hand.
KNIVES CHAU
Tamara is into this Korean guy,
Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby
has a crush on Mina.
SCOTT
I thought Derek and Tamara had a
mutual like-each-other thing going,
what happened?
Scott and Knives amble down a snow covered sidewalk.
KNIVES CHAU
I mean, I've...I've never gone out
with someone so talented.
SCOTT
You go out with a lot of guys?
KNIVES CHAU
...no.
SCOTT
Yeah, so whatever, man!
KNIVES CHAU
I've never even kissed a guy.
Knives blushes and looks at the ground. Scott hugs her.
SCOTT
Me neither.
Scott and Knives walk up to the front of Wallace's apartment.
KNIVES CHAU
So this is your secret lair? Can I

SCOTT
My secret lair is one of those 'no

KNIVES CHAU
Oh, okay.
SCOTT
But do you want to see the house
where I grew up?
KNIVES CHAU
Sure.
They literally walk across the street to a small house.
SCOTT
Here you go.
KNIVES CHAU
Wow.
SCOTT
Yeah. Wow.
Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand...
...Scott wanders alone through a barren land. He falls to his
knees next to a lonely cactus.
SCOTT
Oh God...so...so alone.
A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She
wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink
hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun.
MYSTERIOUS GIRL
You're not alone. You're just
having some idiotic dream.
SCOTT
Does that mean we can make out?
But she's gone...
STEPHEN STILLS
I told you like fifty times!
Scott, Kim Pine, Stephen Stills and Young Neil walk down an
icy Toronto street. Scott's head is still in the clouds.
KIM PINE
We're going to this party, retard.
SCOTT
Party?
YOUNG NEIL
At Julie's.
SCOTT
Ugh. I thought you guys split.
STEPHEN STILLS
We did. But, you know, there may be
some label guys there, so...
SCOTT
Aw, man. This is going to suck.
KIM PINE
At least it will give us something
to complain about.
SCOTT
Awww maaan...
Scott and Knives walk out of a pizza joint. Knives chows down
on a slice. Scott doesn't eat, his thoughts elsewhere.

SCOTT
Why are you just standing there?
RAMONA
Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.
SCOTT
Sorry, I just assumed you were too
cool to be on time.
RAMONA
Well. You assumed wrong.

Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park.
SCOTT
This is good. So how'd you end up in
Toronto?
RAMONA
Just needed to escape I guess.
SCOTT
Oh yeah?
RAMONA
I got this job here. And Gideon had
always said Toronto was one of the
great cities so...
SCOTT
Is Gideon...is he your boyfriend?
RAMONA
He's...a friend.
SCOTT
Was he your boyfriend?
RAMONA
Do you mind if we don't get into
that right now?
SCOTT
It's so not interesting to me.
They sit on some swings in the park.

SCOTT
Well, it's certainly chilled here.
RAMONA
Yeah.
Uh. Chilled as in cold.
RAMONA
Yeah.
SCOTT
I'm totally obsessed with you.
RAMONA
I didn't mean to get you obsessed.
SCOTT
I just haven't been obsessed with a
girl for a long time. It's weird.
RAMONA
That's probably because you sleep
with a guy.
SCOTT
Um...

I was guessing from your apartment,
but you totally do!

RAMONA
Dude, relax. I believe you. You're
too desperate to be gay.
SCOTT
I feel so stupid.
RAMONA
Aw... you're probably not that

Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing.
SCOTT (CONT'D)
I'm... mostly stupid.
RAMONA
Well, you're definitely stupid if
you want to go out with me.
SCOTT
Exactly, yeah.
The snowfall gets heavier.
RAMONA
This is ridiculous. Isn't it like April?
SCOTT
Yeah. I can barely see you. This whole
thing is an unmitigated disaster.
RAMONA
I think 'act of God' is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.
SCOTT
So this is a 'date', eh?
RAMONA
Did I say 'date'? Slip of the tongue.
SCOTT
Tongue...
The snow gets heavier still. Ramona walks away.

Ramona skates towards the front gate, Scott walking next to
her. WAIST DEEP SNOW covers the roads and sidewalks.
SCOTT
Hey, can this not be a one night
stand? For one thing, I didn't even
get any...that was a joke.
RAMONA
What did you have in mind?

She hands him a note. 'RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'
SCOTT
Wow, girl number.
Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away.
RAMONA
See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim.

A shivering and annoyed Scott dials the payphone.
SCOTT
Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want
to, like, talk or whatever?
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
Are you wearing a tan jacket? Like
a spring jacket? And a hoodie?
SCOTT
Ummm...
Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores.
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.)
And a dorky hat?!
SCOTT
It's not dorky! Why are you psychic?
A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass.

Oh. Uh...okay. Hi.

Sex Bob-Omb tune up. Kim spins a drumstick in her fingers.
KIM PINE
Where's Knives? Not coming tonight?
SCOTT
Oh. No. We broke up.
Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look.
SCOTT (CONT'D)
OH! Check it out, I learned the
bass line from Final Fantasy 2.
Scott plays the insanely simple video game tune.
KIM PINE

Okay! From here on out, no

Okay!

Scott opens the door to see Ramona, now sporting BLUE HAIR.
SCOTT (CONT'D)
Hey...you're here?
RAMONA
Yes. Like you said. Is it not cool?
Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development.
SCOTT
You know your hair?

YOUNG NEIL

KIM PINE
Believe it or not, I actually dated
Scott in high school.
RAMONA

Scott and Ramona climb a STAIRWAY, long handrail between them.
RAMONA
Tell me we didn't come out here
just so you could cover your hair
with that hat.
SCOTT
Nooo. I just love me some walking.
Putting one leg in front of the other.
RAMONA
You seem a little...heightened.
SCOTT
Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm
with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not
that I do drugs, unless you do, in
which case I do drugs all the time,
every drug, but...you make me feel...I
don't know. Things seem a little
brighter around you or something.
Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and
NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.
RAMONA
What is this place?
SCOTT
A totally awesome castle. They're
shooting this movie up here.
Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded
by big, bright movie set lights.
RAMONA
Who's in it?
SCOTT
Winifred Hailey and some actor guy.
RAMONA
Oh, who?
SCOTT
I forget. Let's find out.

A crew readies a shot of WINIFRED HAILEY held hostage by some

WALLACE
I think I'm about to right now.

WALLACE

Ooh?
The UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FANFARE announces LUCAS LEE as he exits
his trailer, smoking a cigarette (blacked out). He skates
towards the set, doing kickflips. The spectators go 'oooh'.
WALLACE
I want to have his adopted babies.

LUCAS LEE
Hey. The only thing keeping me and
her apart is the two minutes it's

SCOTT

RAMONA
In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually,
it might have been math. I just
remember there being lots of drama.
LUCAS LEE
HEY!!!
Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious.
RAMONA
He just followed me around. He was
a little snot nosed brat.
SCOTT
He had snot? In his nose? But he's

It's not a big deal. I only dated

Lucas Lee THROWS Scott up into a castle turret, crumbling it.

Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy.
SCOTT
Hey... hey... hey! I'm not done-
Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!
LUCAS LEE (O.S.)
Looks like you're seeing double.
Scott turns to see the real Lucas, smirking on the sidelines.
POW! The identical Stand In punches Scott to the ground.
LUCAS LEE
He's good, right? Sometimes I let
him do wide shots if I feel like
getting blazed back in my winnie.
Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS
STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically
dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.
LUCAS LEE
I'm nothing without my stunt team.
The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES
through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.
WALLACE
Ask them how it feels to always get
his sloppy seconds!
SCOTT
How does it feel to-
KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a
barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.

Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline.
Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.

Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.
LUCAS LEE
It's called a grind, bro.
SCOTT
So can you do a grind thingy now?
LUCAS LEE
Are you serious? There's like 200

Hey, if it's too hardcore...

You really think you can goad me

Scott chases Ramona down the street outside the venue.
SCOTT
Ramona. I have something I need to
tell you.
RAMONA
Yeah, I have something to-

INTEGRATED FINAL 98A.
86 CONTINUED: 86
SCOTT
(RUSHED)
Great. Listen, I know you just play
mysterious and aloof to avoid
getting hurt. I know you have
reasons for not wanting to talk
about your past. And I want you to
know, I don't care about any of
that stuff. Why? Because I'm in
lesbians with you.
RAMONA
What?
SCOTT
I really, really mean it.

INTEGRATED FINAL 99.
86 CONTINUED: (2) 86
RAMONA
Oh. Okay.
SCOTT
What did you want to tell me?
RAMONA
That we have to break up.
SCOTT
What?
RAMONA
Yeah...it's not going to work out.
SCOTT
Oh okay...
A sleek black '61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.
RAMONA
It's Gideon. I just...I can't help
myself around him.
VOICE (O.S.)
That's the bad news.
GIDEON GRAVES appears behind Scott with Stills and Kim in
tow. The Lincoln parks. A driver opens the passenger door.
GIDEON GRAVES
The good news, Scottie, is I'm
officially loving the Sex Bombs.
SCOTT
Bob-omb.
GIDEON GRAVES
Three piece rock outfit with a semi-
attractive female drummer? Music to
my earholes.
Scott glowers. Ramona looks at the floor. Stills is ga-ga.
TEXT: An arrow points to Stills' crotch, captioned 'PEE'.
GIDEON GRAVES
You know, I'm not even going to wait
to see how you guys do in the final.
I'm signing you right now for a three
album deal.
Gideon produces a CONTRACT and clicks a pen.
GIDEON GRAVES
See? I'm not such a bad guy after
all.

INTEGRATED FINAL 99A.

Scott GRABS the contract and throws it onto the sidewalk.
(CONTINUED)
INTEGRATED FINAL 100.
86 CONTINUED: (4) 86
SCOTT
You think we're gonna sell our
souls to you? Well then guess-
We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is
furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs
it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.
SCOTT
Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band
with this douche-in-charge.
GIDEON GRAVES
Scottie, buddy, can I just say,
keep your emotions in check. Don't
let what's past screw up your
future.
Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the
mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.
STEPHEN STILLS
The people need to hear us, Scott.
SCOTT
Then you're going to need to find
someone else to play bass.
A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.
GIDEON
Looks like we're all set.
Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all
round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.
GIDEON
Oh and Scott, we should really be
thanking each other. I mean, if it
wasn't for me, you would have never
been with Ramona, but if it wasn't
for you, she wouldn't be back with
me. So I guess it all shakes out.
Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.
GIDEON
And hey, the whole League of Evil
Exes thing? I was in a dark place
when I put that together. Forgiven?
Gideon disappears into the Lincoln and drives off and Sex
Bob-Omb drift away. Scott stands alone. He slaps his head-
SCOTT
I said 'lesbians'!
INTEGRATED FINAL 100A.
Scott sits on the swings, staring straight ahead.
Night turns to day. Day turns to night.
Scott remains in the exact same position.
STACEY (O.S.)
Was she really the one?
Scott looks over to see STACEY on the swing next to him.
SCOTT
The wha?
STACEY
I mean, did you really see a future
with this girl?
SCOTT
Like...with jetpacks?
Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug.
STACEY
Time heals all wounds, little
brother. Maybe next time let's not
date the girl with eleven evil ex-
boyfriends.
SCOTT
Seven.
STACEY
Oh. Well that's not so bad.
Stacey heads off. Scott looks at the camera.
Snow blows around a steely eyed Scott as he stomps towards a
group of desolate WAREHOUSES near the water. A lone HIPSTER
KID smokes a cigarette, leaning against a warehouse wall.
HIPSTER KID
Password?
Scott shrugs.
SCOTT
Whatever.
HIPSTER KID
Cool.
The Hipster Kid waves Scott in.
INTEGRATED FINAL 104A.
Scott sits up next to a lone cactus, rubbing his temples.

SCOTT
Ugh.
Ramona appears out of nowhere; fainter than before.
(CONTINUED)
INTEGRATED FINAL 110.
95 CONTINUED: (2) 95
RAMONA
I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks.
SCOTT
You know what sucks? Getting killed
by THAT guy. Why him?
RAMONA
It's complicated.
SCOTT
Well, maybe now would be the time
to get into it. Seeing as I'm about
to die.
RAMONA
Alright... the truth is, it was me
who was obsessed. I was crazy about
him. But he ignored me. I was more
alone when we were together than I
ever was on my own. That's why I
had to leave... and that's when he
started paying attention.
SCOTT
So why go back?
RAMONA
I can't help myself around him,
Scott. He just... has a way of
getting into my head.
SCOTT
Well, that's legitimately
disappointing. I really will leave
you alone forever now...
RAMONA
No. I mean, he literally has a way
of getting into my head.
Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a
blinking CHIP implanted on her skull.
SCOTT
That is evil.
RAMONA
He's like that.
Ramona covers the chip, self-consciously touching her hair.
SCOTT
So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh?
(CONTINUED)
INTEGRATED FINAL 111.
95 CONTINUED: (3) 95
RAMONA
I'm sorry it had to end this way.
We had a good run, I guess.
SCOTT
You can't say I didn't try. I
really fought for you back there.
RAMONA
Uh-huh.
The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away.
RAMONA
But someone was fighting pretty
hard for you back there.
Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany,
SCOTT
Knives?
RAMONA
I wish I was ever as fanatically
devoted to anything as that girl is
to you.
Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.
SCOTT
I feel like I learned something. Which
would be great if I wasn't dead.
Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees.
SCOTT
So...so alone.
DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott.
SCOTT
Ahhhhhh...
We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST
FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We
hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart.
SCOTT
...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...
Scott Pilgrim RUNS towards the desolate WAREHOUSES. The same
HIPSTER KID smokes a cigarette against the wall.
SCOTT
Your hair looks stupid.
The Hipster Kid EXPLODES into COINS.
Knives and Ramona huddle in the snow outside Chaos Theatre.
They look expectantly at the entrance, worried for Scott.
Then...
Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake
hands and part ways. Scott approaches Knives and Ramona.
KNIVES CHAU
What happened?
SCOTT
Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit.
He's a super-nice guy. We actually
have a lot in common.
Scott runs his fingers through his hair.
KNIVES CHAU
Your hair.

KNIVES CHAU
It's getting really shaggy.
Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.
SCOTT
Yeah?
KNIVES CHAU
I like it.
Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking
his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.
SCOTT
You do?
Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see
her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness.
Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.
SCOTT
Hey... Where are you going?
Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.
RAMONA
I dunno. I should probably
disappear.
SCOTT
After all that?
RAMONA
It's hard, you know? I came here to
get away, but the past keeps
catching up. I'm tired of people
getting hurt because of me.
Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.
SCOTT
I think I understand.
Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.
RAMONA
I should tahnk you, though.
SCOTT
For what?
RAMONA
For being the nicest guy I ever
dated.

INTEGRATED FINAL 119A.

SCOTT
That's kind of sad.
RAMONA
(ALMOST LAUGHING)
It is kind of sad.
She takes his hand briefly, then lets it drop.
RAMONA
Well... Bye and stuff.
SCOTT
Yeah. And stuff.
She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-
KNIVES (O.S.)
Go get her.
Surprised, Scott turns back to see a smiling Knives.
SCOTT
Wha?
KNIVES
You earned it. You've been fighting
for her all along.
SCOTT
But what about you?
KNIVES
(totally sweet and sad)
I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you
anyway.
She grins and kisses his cheek.
KNIVES
There's someone out there for me.
We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her.
Guitar still in hand.
We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame.
Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-
KNIVES
Go talk to her. Before she's gone.
Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-
SCOTT (O.S.)
Hey... mind if I tag along?
(CONTINUED)
INTEGRATED FINAL 119B.
104 CONTINUED: (4) 104
Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.
RAMONA
You want to come with me?
SCOTT
(HOPEFUL)
I thought maybe we could... try
again?
Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
earlier. Scott takes it.
We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
middle of the street, snow swirling around it.
Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
to spring.
Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
'Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
cell phone airwaves.
JULIE (V.O.)
Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
with Gideon Graves at the grand
opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
was apparently awesome.
STACEY (V.O.)
Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
mean bananas. My little brother
kicked a guy's head off. Literally.
It was unbelievable. Someone
seriously should have been filming
it.
Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.
CONTINUE? 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...
