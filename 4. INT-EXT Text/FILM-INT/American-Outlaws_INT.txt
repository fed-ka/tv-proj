The room is comfortable and elegant in a simple way. Doc
Mimms is slumped in a big chair. Zee, her eyes red, is
pushing a glass of sherry into his hands. Jesse and Frank
sit across from him.
JESSE
-- rode right into them, screaming
like a banshee.
DOC MIMMS
My little Web did that?
JESSE
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over
our heads, killed a dozen Union
soldiers before they knew what hit
them.
Jesse looks at Frank, urging him on.
FRANK
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling
gun and the cannon all by himself.
JESSE
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of
the Liberty boys would have come
home if not for Web Mimms, Doc.
God's honest truth.
Doc is fighting back tears, but proud.
DOC MIMMS
Web died fighting?
JESSE
Died a hero.
ZEE
(quietly)
But still died.
JESSE
If there's anything we can do for
you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
DOC MIMMS
Start thinking about yourselves.
You, the Youngers, Clell Miller, all
of you. Don't end up like Charlie.
They found out Charlie rode with
Quantrill's Raiders. They arrested
him, tried him by military tribunal
and hanged him this morning.
FRANK
I thought there was general amnesty.
DOC MIMMS
For soldiers, yes. But if you rode
in one of the partisan bands,
they'll hang you for treason. And
you boys are in more danger, because
you've got a farm.
Jesse and Frank don't understand.
ZEE
Daddy, don't start with this again.
DOC MIMMS
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The
railroad men come through, offering
to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then
they start hanging men who own farms
for treason?
FRANK
You're saying the railroad's got
the Army doing it's dirty work?
DOC MIMMS
Rich men in Washington, don't
matter if they wear a tie or a
uniform, they're all the same.
JESSE
All we thought about was coming
home. I swore I'd kill anybody who
tried to get me off my farm again.
If I have to go to war with the
railroad to stay, fine by me.
FRANK
Think about this. If we just come
up with a story and stick to it, we
should be all right.
JESSE
What kind of story are they going
to believe?
ZEE
Hmm. You were in the Confederate
Army with General Hood's Texas Army
until... say Sharpsburg, then you
were reassigned to General Jeb
Stuart's cavalry until you
surrendered in Tennessee.
Pause. The men stare at Zee. Up goes the eyebrow again.
JESSE
That just might work.
FRANK
Maybe, maybe...
DOC MIMMS
Now go on to see your Ma. She'll be
glad to see her sons alive.
(choking)
And for her sake, stay that way.
Jesse and Frank enter, surprised to find Cole, Bob,
Comanche Tom, and a gawky 15 year old JIM YOUNGER all eating
at their kitchen table.
FRANK
Well look at Jimmy Younger. You're
all grown up.
JIM
(mouth full)
Mmmph-hmpph.
BOB
(sheepishly)
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until
we ate something.
COLE
That was two hours ago.
MA
I don't see clean plates.
The men dutifully return to the meal. Jesse nods his head
at Comanche Tom.
JESSE
(quiet)
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice
to our Injun friend.
MA
He's a good Christian and he killed
Yankees. Jesus told me that made him
an all right boy.
Ma WALKS OFF.
FRANK
She's still talking to Jesus.
JESSE
What worries me is that Jesus is
talking back.
Dozens of men and a few women are packed into the one room
school house. Among them are Frank and Jesse. Doc Mimms is
leading the meeting.
FRANK
I went up to the courthouse and
looked at the right of way documents
for the rail bed. The railroad
doesn't even need our land, they're
just taking the land on both sides
for as far as they can.
JESSE
Damn. All that reading paid off.
DOC MIMMS
Floor recognizes Clell Miller.
CLELL MILLER, tall and blond, steps forward.
CLELL
They're saying we don't sell, we
might end up with nothing!
FRANK
That's only if we don't stick
together.
DOC MIMMS
(pointing)
Loni Packwood.
LONI PACKWOOD, a sad, scruffy man stands up.
LONI
I say this is the last straw. I
came back from the war, I found my
house burned down. My cows was dead.
Now my wife's run off with my
cousin, Jeb, that sonofabitch.
(tearing up)
Took my dog--
DOC MIMMS
Ah, Loni, about the railroad.
LONI
I forget.
(almost weeping)
Took my dog...
Another FARMER steps up.
FARMER
I signed.
FRANK
Harlan, you can't.
FARMER
I'm tired of fighting. I'm just
gonna take my family and move west.
CLELL
Maybe we should hire a lawyer.
FARMER 2
That's a good idea!
FRANK
It would be, if the courts were on
the up and up.
CLELL
So what do we do?
ANGLE ON
the school house door as it BANGS open and Bob Younger
STUMBLES IN, bleeding from a cut on his forehead, being
supported by Zee.
BOB
They got Cole.
He collapses into a seat. The crowd surrounds him.
ZEE
He came to our house, Daddy. I
figured you'd all want to hear this.
Jesse and Frank are next to Bob. Zee puts a hand on Jesse's
shoulder. He notices.
BOB
They came up, made the same offer
they made you folks. Our little
brother Jim tried to chase 'em off,
one of those detectives hit him in
the head, knocked him out. Cole lost
his temper.
FRANK
(rubbing his
forehead)
Oh no...
BOB
He just lost his temper a little.
JESSE
(sighing)
How many of them did he kill?
BOB
Two.
FRANK
Damn!
BOB
They said because the detectives
were working for the Department of
the Interior --
FRANK
The Army can hang him.
BOB
Tomorrow.
CLELL
What do we do?
JESSE
Nothing.
The crowd stares at Jesse.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
You folks are going to do nothing.
You're all going to go home right
now. So you're going to be able to
swear on a Bible that you don't know
anything about what's going to
happen tomorrow.
Jesse's gaze is at once noble and terrifying. The crowd
quietly begins to disperse.
DOC MIMMS
Boys...
JESSE
Go home, Doc.
(softly)
They ain't gonna hang no more
Liberty boys.
Doc Mimms nods, EXITS.
Jesse walks to the other end of the school house. Bob,
Frank, Clell and Loni fall in behind him. The door SWINGS
OPEN again and Comanche Tom enters with Jim Younger sporting
six-guns way too big for him.
COMANCHE TOM
I couldn't lose him.
BOB
Jim Younger, I told you--
JIM
It's my fault they're gonna hang
Cole. I want in.
FRANK
Jim, it was just a matter of time
before they tried to hang somebody
else to scare off the other farmers.
JESSE
And you're too young.
JIM
(to Jesse)
I'm the same age you were when you
went off to war.
JESSE
And the same age Web was. No.
ZEE (O.S.) (O.S.)
You're wasting time.
Zee joins them.
JESSE
Zee, go home.
Zee's eyebrows go up.
ZEE
Who else was there when they hanged
the others?
The men look at each other. Nothing.
ZEE
(CONT'D)
You need to know how they do it.
Which way they walk up. What order
they do things in. And if you mess
up rescuing Cole because you won't
listen to a woman, then God damn you
all.
Pause.
JESSE
All right. Seven of us against a
Union regiment and Pinkerton
detectives in broad daylight in the
middle of Main Street.
Jesse smiles.
BOB
He's smiling.
JIM
Is that bad?
FRANK
Very.
Doc Mimms has just finished bandaging Jesse, who lies
unconscious beneath the sheets. Zee is holding an oil lamp.
ZEE
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
DOC MIMMS
The bullet came out clean, but he
lost a whole lot of blood. Praying
wouldn't hurt.
The SOUND OF HOOFBEATS APPROACHES from outside.
Doc Mimms opens the door. A UNION OFFICER and a squad of
soldiers push in.
OFFICER
Good evening, sir, we're looking
for a fugitive.
DOC MIMMS
A fugitive? Who?
OFFICER
We don't know, but he was very
badly wounded. We're checking all
the houses in the area.
Zee hears her father protesting, then FOOTSTEPS on the
stairs. Quickly she undresses, grabs a quilt from a chest
and jumps into bed with Jesse. She pulls the quilt up to her
neck, completely hiding him.
At that moment, the Officer barges in. Zee lets out a
little gasp as if startled awake. She covers herself with
the quilt.
ZEE
Sir! Who are you?
OFFICER
Oh. Sorry ma'am.
ZEE
I should hope so.
The Officer EXITS. Zee watches the door for a moment, then
looks down fondly at Jesse.
ZEE
(CONT'D)
Jesse, are you awake?
JESSE
(groggy)
Mmmm.
Zee gently pushes his hair off his face. Then her
expression changes.
ZEE
Jesse, is that your hand?
JESSE
Nuh-huh ...
Jesse smiles in his sleep. Zee jumps out of the bed and
wraps a dressing gown around herself. Doc Mimms enters.
DOC MIMMS
They're gone. What are you --
ZEE
I fooled them into thinking I was
alone.
DOC MIMMS
Well, I hope the boy pulls through.
We should know in the morning.
ZEE
(with a little smile)
I think he's already feeling better.
A puzzled Doc Mimms follows her out.
There are two teller windows, a couple of male customers
and a MOTHER and CHILD.
Jesse and Cole ENTER dressed for the trail, longrider coats
and spurs. Saddlebags are slung over their shoulders.
JESSE
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
but I have bad news. The railroad
payroll has been stolen.
The BANK MANAGER steps out from behind his desk.
MANAGER
What are you talking about? The
railroad's money is right over there
in that safe.
Jesse draws two guns, Cole produces a shotgun from his coat.
JESSE
That safe?
MANAGER
Ah.
Jesse and the Bank Manager are having a staredown.
MANAGER
This is outrageous. Who are you
people?
JESSE
The James Gang.
COLE
(annoyed)
The James-Younger Gang.
JESSE
Sorry.
COLE
Don't let it happen again.
Cole turns to the Woman and Child.
COLE
Ma'am, kindly cover that child's
eyes.
WOMAN
Why?
COLE
I don't want her to see me shoot
this man.
The woman covers the child's eyes. Cole raises the shotgun.
Jesse half covers his eyes and turns his head. The Manager
swallows.
A lean, middle-aged SHERRIFF is walking by his window. His
DEPUTY is whittling at the desk. The Sherriff pulls up short.
SHERRIFF
What the --
DEPUTY
What is it?
SHERRIFF
Old Man Tucker is just standing
quiet outside the bank.
DEPUTY
So?
SHERRIFF
When have you ever known Old Man
Tucker not to be yelling at
everybody?
He takes in the group of riders, reaches for his rifle.
The crowded saloon is alive with music, card-playing, and
dancing girls. Various James Gang members are playing cards
and drinking. Jesse, Cole, and Frank are at the bar.
COLE
It's not a bank.
JESSE
It's better. It's a construction
depot. They'll have the strongbox
and some ammo and explosives for us
to take. That way we can take on a
bigger job.
FRANK
And it's guarded by Pinkerton
detectives.
JESSE
And I do so want to shoot some
Pinkerton detectives.
Jesse and Cole grin and slap each other on the back. Jim
BURSTS in waving a newspaper. He quickly runs to the bar.
JIM
(stage whispering)
We're famous!
Jesse takes the paper.
JESSE
I'll be damned!
The other Gang members drift over to the bar.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
(reading)
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was
robbed on Tuesday by a gang of
twenty heavily armed men."
COLE
Twenty?!
LONI
What are the odds, another gang
robbing the same place right after
we did.
BOB
Yeah, Loni, that's exactly what
happened.
JESSE
"The outlaws calling themselves the
James-Younger Gang shot their way
out of town, wounding the Sherriff
and three other townsfolk."
BOB
Hey!
JESSE
"Bank officials estimate the loss
at fifty thousand dollars."
CLELL
We only got ten thousand.
COMANCHE TOM
This happens all the time when you
let the white man count the money.
JESSE
"The U.S. District Marshal at St.
Louis called this the first daylight
bank robbery in American history."
Jim whistles.
JIM
We made history. That's something
to be proud of.
COLE
The rest of this is all lies.
JESSE
That just means the next time,
we'll have to set the record
straight ourselves.
The Gang looks at him.
Doc Mimms is reading a paper to Zee.
DOC MIMMS
"...written by the outlaw Jesse
James himself."
Zee is pacing.
ZEE
He thinks this is some kind of game!
DOC MIMMS
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and
Cole know what they're doing. I'm
sure they won't press their luck.
Zee looks at him. Doc Mimms sighs.
DOC MIMMS
(CONT'D)
I know. But the Lord protects
madmen and prophets, and
Jesse's...one of them. I'm just not
sure which.
DISSOLVE TO:
The ENGINEER nudges the fireman.
ENGINEER
Look at that.
Outside, along the railbed, members of the James Gang are
holding a series of signs, each one a dozen yards after the
other. The engineer reads each one as they pass.
ENGINEER
(CONT'D)
(reading)
"Better... slow... down...
dynamite... ahead... too late...
you're dead!"
The engineer and the fireman look up. Ahead of them on the
track is an overloaded wagon with barrels marked "TNT".
The engineer slams on the brakes. The high pitched scream
of steel on steel sounds out over the avalanche of sparks
flying from the wheels.
Jesse sticks his head in, guns drawn.
JESSE
That was a fine piece of driving,
yes sir.
He looks at the wagon. The engineer and fireman follow his
gaze.
Jesse grins as the engineer and fireman hang their heads.
Jesse and Frank walk into a large bank dressed in suits.
Just inside the door, Frank notices something odd and
nudges Jesse. It's a "Wanted" poster. "Frank and Jesse
James. $5,000 reward."
They look back and forth at the artist's sketches and each
other. They shake their heads "no."
Jesse walks over to the teller's window. He hands a bill to
the TELLER.
JESSE
Could you change this please?
TELLER
(studying it)
Sir, this bill is counterfeit!
Jesse draws. Frank whistles and Cole, Bob and Jim burst in.
JESSE
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do
you mind if I take a look at all
your real bills to compare?
FRANK
It's the scientific method. It's
all the rage.
IN a richly paneled conference room, a group of BANKERS,
POLITICIANS and RAILROAD OFFICIALS are gathered around a
large table. On the table is a map with a dozen red markers.
Thaddeus Rains and Alan Pinkerton are studying the map.
RAINS
Senator, can't you do anything?
A Missouri SENATOR shakes his head.
SENATOR
The people see the James-Younger
Gang as heroes against the Eastern
businessmen. This is not an area
where men in suits are much loved.
RAINS
Pinkerton, why can't you get these
outlaws?
PINKERTON
It's early in the game yet, Mr.
Rains. Jesse James and I are just
learning how each other moves,
feeling out each other's patterns.
RAINS
I'm losing millions of dollars and
months of time while you play chess
with these farmers!
PINKERTON
Hardly farmers. I've done some
checking. All these were in the War.
These men know sabotage, tactics,
and have four years of bloody
fighting experience behind them.
They are disciplined, well-trained
and have a charismatic leader. If I
were to design the perfect outlaw
band, this gang is what I would
create.
RAINS
So you can't tell me anything?
PINKERTON
It's going to be a long winter.
Rains pounds the table.
MONTAGE: VARIOUS SHOTS
-- THE GANG On horseback, firing back at a posse.
-- THE GANG RIDES THROUGH A FIELD
Where dozens of sharecroppers are sweating away. They leave
a wake of twenty dollar gold certificates fluttering in the
furrows and hanging in the corn.
-- PINKERTON, LEADING TWENTY DETECTIVES,
RIDING HARD up to a crossroad. With a wave of his hand,
never stopping, he splits one group off to head East, and he
and the others head West.
WALL OF "WANTED" POSTERS
Marked the "James-Younger Gang." The James brothers and
Younger brothers nod at the likenesses, which are getting
better. All except Bob, who stares at his in disbelief. It
looks nothing like him.
Jesse tears down his poster and autographs it for a young
boy.
The same men in suits and the same map, only now with more
red markers on it.
In the center of the group are Thaddeus
Rains, Rollin Parker and Alan Pinkerton.
RAINS
Pinkerton. It's been eight months.
I see robberies. I see hold ups. But
I do not see men on the end of
nooses.
PINKERTON
All of the James Gang's encounters
have been with local law enforcement
who, quite frankly, are no match for
this group's cunning.
PARKER
What about your detectives? They
haven't --
Pinkerton suddenly CLOSES on Rains and Parker. Rains
doesn't back down, but we are acutely aware of the fact that
Alan Pinkerton is a big, violent Scotsman. He never raises
his voice here, but then again -- he doesn't have to.
PINKERTON
(to Parker)
First of all: you, shut up.
(to Rains)
Now, you've given me a thousand
miles of railroad to cover. Every
time the James Gang strikes, we
shift a hundred detectives to that
area. But there's just too much open
land, too many riverbeds to ride,
caves to hide in. This gang operates
across four states, often riding a
hundred miles between jobs.
RAINS
I can't believe this.
PINKERTON
And there are some towns in
Missouri where James and his men can
walk openly, as heroes.
PARKER
How can that be?
PINKERTON
They donate money to farmers, to
churches. Rumor has it they gave the
sharecroppers of Maddox so much
money they were able to build a
school.
RAINS
With my money!
PARKER
We should go burn that school to
the ground, sir!
PINKERTON
(dryly)
Yes, that's the way to win the
locals back to our side.
RAINS
I demand action.
PINKERTON
No, you demand results. They are
not the same thing. And if you want
results, you will let me do my job
as I see fit. Unless of course,
(jerking his head at
Parker)
You want this fool to saddle up and
take another run at it?
RAINS
Can't you tell me anything?
PINKERTON
It's going to be a long spring.
MONTAGE: VARIOUS SHOTS
-- THE GANG RIDES ALONGSIDE A PAYROLL COACH, The COACH is
marked with the "Rock Northern Railroad" logo.
Suddenly Pinkerton guards leap up from hiding places in the
coach and start firing! The gang fires back dropping two of
the men.
BANK WINDOW
Old "Wanted" posters are replaced by a new set.
THE COACH IS STOPPED
Jesse and Frank are pulling the payroll off as the rest of
the Gang keeps their guns on the remaining Pinkertons. Two
dead Pinkertons lie on the ground.
JESSE
See, that's a shame. If people
would just hand over the money and
not shoot at us --
Loni looks at something in his hand.
BOB
What's that?
LONI
Lucky Rabbit's foot. Took it off
that dead fella over there.
BOB
I don't think that one's working,
Loni.
Loni pockets the charm.
-- JESSE, FRANK, AND THE YOUNGER BROTHERS Sit heads bowed
in a small country church as the collection plate is passed.
Jesse drops in a handful of twenty dollar gold pieces.
-- A GROUP OF BOYS SWARM AROUND JESSE,
Getting him to autograph his "WANTED! $10,000 REWARD DEAD
OR ALIVE!" Poster. The Gang is all there, admiring the new
posters. The likenesses are remarkable -- except for Bob's.
It still looks nothing like him. And we can see Cole is not
pleased at all the attention Jesse's getting.
-- PINKERTON IN THE BOARD ROOM WITH HIS MAP,
Directing his lieutenants on how to cover the territory.
-- THE GANG CAROUSING IN A SALOON.
Jesse is off to one side, writing a letter on fancy
stationery. Frank is coaching him.
AT THE MIMMS HOME,
Doc Mimms hands Zee the envelope we just saw Jesse working
with. Zee takes the envelope and tosses it into the burning
fireplace.
Jesse, Cole, Frank, and Bob are in the middle of a
stick-up. All the BANK PATRONS have their hands up.
JESSE
Okay, folks, I think we know how
this is going to go...
BOB
One false move and I'll blow your
heads off!
Jesse, Frank, and Cole look at Bob.
JESSE
Beg pardon?
BOB
You heard me, Jesse. You know how
crazy I get!
Jesse and Cole turn to the HEAD TELLER.
JESSE
'Scuse us.
HEAD TELLER
Think nothing of it.
Jesse and Cole cross to Bob.
COLE
We got a problem here, brother?
BOB
(low)
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little
left out.
JESSE
(sighing)
This is about the "Wanted!"
Posters, isn't it.
BOB
Yes. I am obviously not standing
out in people's minds at the
robberies.
COLE
(to Jesse)
This is your fault for hogging all
the publicity.
JESSE
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob
is an important part of the gang.
Frank arrives.
FRANK
Gents, we are in the middle of
something here.
JESSE
Bob's upset.
FRANK
The posters?
JESSE/COLE
Yeah.
BOB
Don't say "yeah" in that voice.
This is important.
Frank, Jesse, and Cole exchange looks. They turn back to
the now puzzled crowd.
FRANK
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had
to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
JESSE
Bob here'll kill a man for
sneezing, and he's the best shot in
the gang.
HEAD TELLER
Better than you, Jesse?
JESSE
Bob Younger taught me how to shoot!
The crowd MURMURS APPRECIATIVELY.
FRANK
Now, we would like to get back to
the robbery.
HEAD TELLER
Of course.
The Head Teller starts filling a saddlebag with money. Bob
glares at a few people, then nods at Jesse. Jesse winks back.
DISSOLVE TO:
The place is alive with song, gambling, and the money the
James Gang is dropping. At one table, Loni Packwood lays
down his poker hand. As the other players moan, he rakes in
the pot.
CLELL
Damn, Loni, you're lucky.
LONI
Luckiest man in the West, now that
I'm riding with Jesse James!
He raises his lucky rabbit's foot in toast to Jesse, who is
at the bar nursing a bottle of whisky with Frank.
ANGLE ON
Jesse and Frank at the bar.
JESSE
This has been a good year.
FRANK
Jesse, we're outlaws.
JESSE
And we're good at it.
FRANK
It got to you, didn't it. All the
killing in the war. You need it now.
JESSE
You've killed your fair share of
men.
FRANK
If I could go back to farming --
JESSE
That's a lie. You could've bought a
dozen farms with the money we've
stolen.
FRANK
I can't quit and leave you alone. I
can't quit until you quit. Ma
would've wanted it that way.
JESSE
We're doing this for Ma.
FRANK
Maybe it started out that way. But
now...
JESSE
What do you want me to say, Frank?
I was killing men when I was
fifteen. I like getting shot at. I
like riding out of town with a posse
at my back. This is a helluva better
life than farming.
FRANK
A better life than the one you
could have had with Zee?
Jesse HURLS the whisky bottle against the wall. At the
CRASH the saloon falls silent. Every eye turns to the James
boys. Frank stands up.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
I'll bet you every dollar we've
stolen that she hasn't read a single
one of the letters you've sent her.
Jesse is boiling. His hand twitches.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
You going to throw down on me,
Jesse?
Jesse's jaw is grinding.
JESSE
Don't do this, Frank. You know I
love you.
Frank nods, embraces his brother. The saloon noise STARTS
UP again. Frank steps away.
FRANK
We're drunk.
JESSE
Oh yeah.
FRANK
Just do me a favor. Think about
what this is costing everybody. Not
just the railroad.
Jesse nods and Frank EXITS. Jim Younger, also drunk, steps
up.
JIM
You okay, Jesse?
JESSE
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky?
You're too young to be drinking
whisky.
JIM
Not too young to shoot a man, not
to young to drink.
JESSE
(jolted)
I guess so.
JIM
I was always jealous Web Mimms got
to go off and fight with you and
Cole. Now it's my turn.
Jesse takes this in silently.
JESSE
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
JIM
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting
ready to turn on the Younger charm.
Jesse raises an eyebrow.
JIM
(CONT'D)
Well, not exactly.
JESSE
You been with a girl ever?
JIM
(insulted)
Hell yeah! I been with...
(sighs)
Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't
want to get one of these paid
ladies, you know?
JESSE
I think so.
JIM
You and Frank and Cole, and even
Bob, get all these girls because
you're good looking and famous. You
don't have to pay. They just look at
me like I'm the baby brother.
(then)
Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
JESSE
I swear.
JIM
(whispering)
Tell you something else.
(belches)
I can't drink that good neither.
I'm going to go outside and throw up.
JESSE
You do that.
Jim stumbles away and OUT THE DOOR. We hear him THROWING UP
ENERGETICALLY a moment later. Jesse thinks for a moment,
beckons over the bartender.
Jim stumbles back in. A pretty young woman, LYLA,
approaches him.
LYLA
Excuse me. Are you Jim Younger?
Jim pulls himself together.
JIM
Why, yeah.
LYLA
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James
told me your name.
JIM
(crestfallen)
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
LYLA
Yes, but just so I could find out
who you were.
Jim brightens.
JIM
Really?
LYLA
I hope I'm not being too forward.
JIM
Not at all.
LYLA
I just though you were awful cute.
JIM
Thank you, Miss -- ?
LYLA
Lyla Devereux.
JIM
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you
a drink?
LYLA
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's
so loud down here.
JIM
(trying to stay
smooth)
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry
to sip while we talk?
LYLA
That is so gentlemanly of you.
As they head to the bar, WE SEE Jesse slide some money to
the bartender.
JIM
(crossing)
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a
European girl once.
LYLA
Really?
JIM
Don't talk about it much, though.
Parker is leading Rains into the room. Rains SNAPS SHUT his
ever-present Pocketwatch.
PARKER
The final route for the railroad is
complete.
RAINS
I look forward to seeing it.
A group of RAILROAD MEN wait around, wearing forced smiles.
Parker shows Rains the map.
REVEAL the wall-sized map of the United States. The plainly
marked RAIL LINE extends due west from New York, through
Philadelphia, a straight shot west --
-- until it reaches Missouri, where it takes a painfully
obvious swing in a large semi-circle south of the state,
then swings up again and continues due west.
Rains takes this in. Parker and the railroad men are trying
to look casual.
RAINS
(CONT'D)
Parker.
PARKER
Sir?
RAINS
What is that?
PARKER
What, sir?
Suddenly, viciously, Rains GRABS PARKER BY THE NECK and
SLAMS his face against the map.
RAINS
(calmly)
That.
PARKER
(strangled)
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Rains drops Parker, who slides to the floor stunned. He
turns to JENKINS, who is suddenly in an open area cleared by
the retreating railroad men.
JENKINS
Sir.
RAINS
Jenkins.
JENKINS
We've done a financial study of the
construction costs projected into --
RAINS
Jenkins.
JENKINS
It's cheaper to go around Jesse
James, sir. Even with the detour and
the extra track. It's just cheaper.
Rains turns to look at the map.
RAINS
So he's won.
PINKERTON (O.S.) (O.S.)
No.
ANGLE ON
The entire group looking at a serene Pinkerton staring at
the James Gang tracking map, which is now festooned with red
markers.
PINKERTON
(CONT'D)
Every three months, the James Gang
circles back to the vicinity of
Liberty, Missouri. They always pull
a job right before they return,
probably to have extra money to give
family and friends.
RAINS
In English, Pinkerton.
PINKERTON
There are only four banks within
that travel radius which they have
not robbed.
RAINS
Can you put men at all four?
PINKERTON
No need. I have another tool at my
disposal which will narrow it down
to one bank.
RAINS
What is that?
PINKERTON
(smiling)
Why, their intense hatred of you,
of course.
The room holds its breath. Rains begins to smile back.
Back in a semiprivate card room, Cole is talking to the
rest of the Gang.
COLE
It'll be the biggest score yet.
JESSE (O.S.) (O.S.)
What will be?
Jesse and Frank step from the shadows. Cole tosses them a
newspaper.
COLE
Hyperion Bank, two day's ride from
Liberty. They've got a hundred
thousand dollars in railroad money
just sitting there.
Jesse tosses the paper aside.
JESSE
Smells funny, it being mentioned in
the paper.
COLE
If you'd read about it first, you'd
have no problems.
JESSE
What are you saying?
COLE
I've robbed just as many banks as
you have! I know this town, and I
know this bank, and I say it's an
easy job.
JESSE
You're forgetting who's in charge --
FRANK
(calming him)
Jesse.
COLE
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't
partners any more, Jesse? You tell
Cole Younger where and when to ride?
FRANK
Cole, he didn't mean that.
JESSE
You taking sides against me, now,
Frank?
FRANK
No, I --
COLE
So being with me is being against
you? Well, we don't want to do that!
None of us poor idiots want to go up
against the famous Jesse James,
greatest outlaw who ever lived!
Jesse glares at Cole. The Gang is murmuring amongst
themselves.
COLE
(CONT'D)
That's what the newspapers say.
Weren't for Jesse James, this gang
wouldn't be able to find a goat's
ass with a stick.
BOB
What?
Clell Miller leans forward.
CLELL
You have got mighty full of
yourself lately, Jesse.
JESSE
You think so. You all do?
(to Frank)
You?
Frank hesitates a half-second too long.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
(spitting)
Beautiful.
COLE
Now the one time one of us comes up
with an idea --
JESSE
A bad idea.
COLE
I got us through the War all right.
JESSE
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
COLE
That's it.
Cole LUNGES for Jesse, and in a flash they're
streetfighting, all elbows and knees and rib punches,
GRUNTING and SWEARING. Frank and Bob try to break it up, but
it's too fierce.
COMANCHE TOM
Let them fight it out. The poison
needs to leave the wound, to heal.
Jesse lands a ROUNDHOUSE, knocking Cole away. Cole goes for
his gun, and in a blur they've both DRAWN and stand facing
each other with cocked six-guns. The Gang watches in stunned
silence.
BOB
This is healing?
COMANCHE TOM
Sometimes a wound will kill.
BOB
Now you tell us.
FRANK
(edging in)
Boys, we don't want this.
Neither Jesse nor Cole will back down. They circle, still
keeping their guns up.
COLE
(gritted teeth)
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
JESSE
And I'm the better outlaw.
Jim steps up.
JIM
And you both hate the railroad.
That's what's important. We do this
job, and Thaddeus Rains won't dare
come West again.
Jesse's gaze slides to Jim.
JESSE
What about that Rock Island bastard?
JIM
It's his money.
He's putting up
the payroll out of his own fortune.
You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains,
don't you Jesse?
Jesse and Cole stare at each other again.
JESSE
Still smells fishy.
COLE
Then let me run the show, General
Lee.
Jesse thumbs down the hammer of his Colt. Cole does the
same. The entire Gang breathes out as one.
JESSE
Fine. We hit this bank.
COLE
You'll be smiling once you've got
all that money to spend, cousin.
(to Gang)
Cole Younger's going to make
everybody rich!
The Gang CHEERS. Frank watches Jesse cross to the WINDOW
and sag against it, exhausted.
DISSOLVE TO:
Cole and the James brothers stride in.
COLE
Nobody move! This is a robbery!
The dozen or so farmers and tellers raise their hands.
door.
COLE
What the --
JESSE'S POV in a mirror by the door reveals all twelve of
the men in the bank drawing guns, shotguns, one rifle --
Jesse shoves Cole and Frank down. He KICKS a stool at the
man with the rifle, dives right and ROLLS across a big oak
desk. The men begin to FIRE. As BULLETS PING around him,
Jesse FIRES from between his legs as he rolls across the
desk. The assassins start to drop.
Jesse completes his roll at a railing separating the
manager's area from the bank floor. In one smooth move he's
up and RUNNING ALONG THE RAILING, defying gravity, drawing
his shoulder Colts and shooting...
The gunmen are crossing into each other's line of fire,
Jesse's movement confusing them. Jesse's killed another
five, only four left, but he's out of railing and --
CRASH! Through a teller's cage, disappearing behind the
counter. The gunmen turn and BLAST the wooden counter, some
screaming in panic.
CLICKS are heard as hammers fall on
empty magazines.
The gunmen stare at where Jesse disappeared, panting
heavily.
CLICK.
They forgot about Cole and Frank.
A shot of the open, empty VAULT.
COLE
Dammit!
JESSE (O.S.) (O.S.)
A trap.
Cole turns. Jesse is moving the surviving cowboys into the
Vault. As the last one steps in, Jesse SLAMS the door
closed. WE HEAR MORE GUNFIRE. Frank runs in from the back of
the bank.
FRANK
Another dozen out back.
COLE
They gonna rush us?
FRANK
They're just insurance in case we
run.
Jesse crosses to the front door.
Frank and Cole are shooting through the windows.
JESSE
They're all pinned down. Can't even
get to the door.
FRANK
Got any ideas, little brother?
Jesse thinks, then smiles.
FRANK
(CONT'D)
Oh Lord.
Jesse stumbles to his feet, yanks open the bag. Sticks of
dynamite tumble out.
FRANK/COLE
Oh Lord.
Where wary patrons have taken cover from the gunfire.
Suddenly --
BOOOM! One wall EXPLODES into dust! In the hole we see the
interior of the Bank and --
Jesse James running through, already readying another stick
of dynamite --
The blacksmith is gone, but there's a fire in the FORGE.
Jesse leaps and KICKS OVER the forge --
ANGLE ON
The white-hot coals IGNITING everything.
A PASTOR sits at his desk while Jesse finishes filling out
a marriage license.
PASTOR
This is unusual. Most of our
marriages are members of the
congregation.
JESSE
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Jesse slides him two twenties with the license.
PASTOR
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of
the charitable.
(reading the license)
"Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James?
The Jesse James?
JESSE
I could have lied I suppose, but I
want this marriage to be legal. I
just want you to know, I'm trying to
start a new life here. I'm depending
on your...
PASTOR
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the
cloth.
JESSE
Thank you.
PASTOR
Who needs to repair a leaky church
roof.
Grinning, Jesse slides over another forty.
PASTOR
(CONT'D)
Now let's have a drink.
JESSE
Right here in church?
PASTOR
Communion.
The Pastor pours. They drink.
Various townsfolk are lined up at the TELLER'S window.
Cole, Bob, Comanche Tom, Clell and some NEW GANG MEMBERS
BURST IN.
COLE
Nobody move! This is a robbery.
Everybody's hands reach for the ceiling. Cole gestures to
the Teller.
COLE
(CONT'D)
The safe. Now.
TELLER
Of course!
(pause)
Uh, sir?
COLE
What?
TELLER
Where is Jesse James?
COLE
This here is the Younger Gang!
A MAN speaks out timidly.
MAN
But the Youngers ride with Jesse
James.
COLE
Did ride. No more.
The crowd grumbles, plainly disappointed.
COLE
(CONT'D)
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
TELLER
All right, all right.
(muttering)
Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Bob and Comanche Tom exchange looks behind a fuming Cole.
The new Gang is spending its booty. Cole is putting a
healthy dent in a bottle of rotgut. Bob is consoling him.
BOB
This is the best score yet.
COLE
It's still taking too long. The
people used to snap to.
BOB
That was because of... the
reputation the gang had.
COLE
As long as people think Jesse's
still riding, we will never get the
respect we deserve.
BOB
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly
the most respectable job, if you
know what I mean.
COLE
Leave me alone, Bob.
Even Bob can't reach Cole now. He walks sadly away.
DISSOLVE TO:
Cole and the Gang are killing time. Bob runs in.
BOB
They arrested Jesse!
He throws the paper to the other Gang members, but walks
straight to Cole. The two brothers stare at each other.
COLE
How'd they --
BOB
What have you done?
COLE
I ain't done --
BOB
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Bob draws on Cole. Cole is shattered.
COLE
Bob. I didn't...
BOB
Swear.
COLE
I swear --
BOB
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
Cole hesitates. Bob thumbs back the hammer. Comanche Tom's
hand closes over Bob's gun.
COMANCHE TOM
Bob. You know Cole would never do
such a thing. He and Jesse are best
friends. They are cousins, blood
brothers.
Bob considers it, lowers the gun.
BOB
I'm sorry, Cole.
COLE
You're just upset about Jesse. We
all are.
Bob walks off. Comanche Tom speaks, but keeps his eyes on
Bob.
COMANCHE TOM
My people know that when a brother
kills a brother, a great curse comes
down on that man, and when he dies
he walks the desert as a dark
spirit. I like Bob too much to let
that happen.
(looking at Cole)
If I find out you turned in Jesse,
I'll kill you myself.
Comanche Tom moves off. Cole's thoughts are his own.
DISSOLVE TO:
A dank, black cell far in the bowels of Fort Jefferson. WE
HEAR CLANKING.
WIDEN TO REVEAL Jesse doing push-ups. They come easily,
despite Jesse being chained up like the Frankenstein monster.
The DOOR OPENS. Jesse looks up in mid-push-up. Alan
Pinkerton is looking down at him.
Jesse moves to the bed. Pinkerton, flanked by two guards,
ENTERS. He sits on a stool provided by one of the guards.
PINKERTON
We're moving you tomorrow.
JESSE
But I like the presidential suite.
PINKERTON
Oh, it's a similar room. But the
hotel is in Washington D.C. You're
not going to get a fair trial down
here, in front of a jury of Jesse
James sympathizers.
JESSE
So I'll get a fair trial in front
of a jury bought off by Thaddeus
Rains?
PINKERTON
That's the idea.
Pinkerton produces two cigars, presenting one to Jesse.
JESSE
Did you order our houses burned
down?
PINKERTON
Not that day. I am guilty of many
things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus
Rains and Parker, that day.
Jesse takes the cigar, and Pinkerton lights both. They puff
for a moment.
PINKERTON
(CONT'D)
(tapping bad leg)
Was this you, by the way?
Jesse exposes his scar.
JESSE
You almost ended my career before
it began.
PINKERTON
Pity.
Pause.
PINKERTON
(CONT'D)
How did you spot the ambush in
Torrell?
JESSE
Last February?
PINKERTON
Mmm.
JESSE
You had all those cattle there, so
I'd think the extra men were in town
from the cattle drive?
PINKERTON
Yes?
JESSE
The cows had a brand from a farm
just five miles out of town.
PINKERTON
Damn.
Pause.
JESSE
Almost got me in Billings. I saw
you there, shooting at me.
PINKERTON
I went myself to oversee the
operation. Didn't help much.
JESSE
No, that one was close. A couple
fellas quit after that one.
PINKERTON
Oh. That's nice to know.
(then)
We're going to hang you, you know.
JESSE
I figured.
PINKERTON
Was it worth it?
JESSE
Should have just killed Thaddeus
Rains and been done with it.
PINKERTON
That's what I would have done.
JESSE
I'm not hanged yet.
PINKERTON
(shaking his head)
You cocky little bastard.
JESSE
Ahh, you'll miss me.
PINKERTON
No, I'll hang you.
(then)
But I may miss you just a bit.
As Jesse and Pinkerton smoke and discuss the past year...
The guards turn Jesse over to a BURLY DETECTIVE. Pinkerton
enters just behind him. There are ten detectives in total in
the car.
PINKERTON
Hook him up.
The Burly Detective brings Jesse's arms above his head. He
loops Jesse's chain over a rail that runs the length of the
car. Two other detectives walk Jesse down the car, Jesse's
hands suspended over his head. Jesse can just barely sit
down.
PINKERTON
(CONT'D)
Now the guns.
BURLY DETECTIVE
I don't like it. We can handle him.
PINKERTON
In the ten seconds we have been in
this car, I have seen you get close
enough for Jesse James to grab your
guns at least three times. And I
assure you, if he gets his hands on
one of your guns, you are all, and I
mean all dead men.
BURLY DETECTIVE
He's chained up.
PINKERTON
I'll put that on your tombstone.
The guns.
Grumbling, the detectives deposit their pistols in a box
near the front of the car. Pinkerton walks out.
The Burly Detective slides a Colt into his waistband.
ANGLE ON
Jesse, alone, surrounded by ten Pinkerton guards. The train
LURCHES, and they're off.
Five guards are playing poker. Five others are standing
along the length of the car. Jesse looks at the gun box
waaay down the other end of the car.
Things shift, and we (and Jesse) realize the train is going
downhill.
JESSE
Hey, fatty.
The Burly Detective looks up.
BURLY DETECTIVE
What?
JESSE
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here
piggy piggy!
The detectives close on Jesse. Jesse stands as the Burly
Detective moves right up on him.
BURLY DETECTIVE
What you sayin' boy?
JESSE
I think I recognize you.
BURLY DETECTIVE
How?
JESSE
I think I saw you leavin' by the
front door just as I was coming in
the back.
The other detectives try to hide grins.
BURLY DETECTIVE
You shut up now, boy.
JESSE
No, really. You're wife said she
needed some help, seeing as you were
so fat you couldn't find your --
Burly Detectives BACKHANDS Jesse. Jesse spits blood and
grins.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Yeah, she said you did that to her
too.
Burly draws, points the gun right at Jesse's face. The
other detectives GASP. Jesse stares down the barrel, then
raises his eyes and speaks in a voice that is low and
terrifying.
JESSE
(CONT'D)
Y'know, I could do this without the
gun, but it just makes things easier.
SLAM as Jesse KICKS Burly in the crotch! The gun FIRES,
missing Jesse's head only because he jerks it like a
mongoose.
Jesse BACKHANDS the detective with the heavy chain! The gun
drops right into Jesse's hands --
The guards are running for the gun box --
Jesse flips the chain TIGHT, TUCKS UP and KICKS OFF from
the back wall and SLIDES THE LENGTH OF THE RAIL over the
detectives' heads! As he reaches the end he FIRES the gun,
blowing open the gun box. Jesse then SHOOTS the rail's
ceiling strut, and then KICKS at the roof.
The rail WRENCHES FREE, dropping Jesse to the floor. In a
blur he's up, reaching into the gun box. He tosses one gun
INTO THE AIR, then FANS THE HAMMER of another.
Half the guards drop, but the other half are right on top
of him and nobody's that fast --
Jesse drops the spent gun, CATCHES the other gun in the
opposite hand and FANS THAT HAMMER all in a single breath!
As the smoke clears, the last of the detectives falls with
a THUD.
Some Pinkertons LOOK UP as a BANG sounds from on top of the
car.
Pinkertons falling, drawing their guns, not able to get a
bead on Jesse because --
The detectives inside start as the wounded man falls into
the doorway.
Pinkerton is already moving as Parker and Thaddeus Rains
look around.
RAINS
What the hell is that sound?
PINKERTON
Vengeance.
Pinkerton bursts in. The men snap to.
PINKERTON
Outside! Get up on top! Go GO!
Pinkerton rushes back in. Parker and Rains are looking out
the window.
PARKER
There's only four of them...
PINKERTON
Move you fools!
He grabs the two businessmen and heads them to the rear of
the train.
