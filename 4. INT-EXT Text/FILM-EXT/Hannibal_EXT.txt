You've sought out The Institution all

Less obvious
is this:
that you require the
institution not to support you, but to
FAIL.
FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE.
ANGLE
ON STARLING, SITTING, NODDING, AS SHE DRINKS HER WINE.
SHE
PUTS THE GLASS DOWN, A TRIFLE WOOZY.

HIM, FROM BEHIND, TO THE SLUMPED FORM OF THE MAN, CAMERA CUTS
OFF AT THE MAN'S SHOULDERS, WE SEE LECHTER, FROM THE BACK,
LIFTING SOMETHING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE MAN'S HEAD, AND
CARRYING IT BACK TO THE FILTHY TABLETOP, WHERE, AS HE SPEAKS,
HE BEGINS KNEADING IT WITH FLOUR, WE SEE THE PAN SIZZLING
ON THE HOTPLATE.
ANGLE
IN THE SLUM ROOM.
STARLING, DAZED, AND LECHTER, REENTERING.
LECHTER (cont'd)
That the institution cannot but be
corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot be
but an act of complicity to seek to
appease it.
HE MOVES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN, PUTS THE BREADED PIECES OF
CUTLET INTO THE PAN, THE FIRE SHOOTS UP.
LECHTER (cont'd)
So many civilizations eat their slain
enemies... what do you think...?
How
much better to devour a person
physically, than to devour his spirit.
Which is, of course, the purpose of the
institution.
HE REMOVES THE MEAT FROM THE PAN, AND FORKS IT ONTO A TIN
PLATE.
LECHTER (cont'd)
(REENTERING THE DININGROOM)
:and that is the especial surprise,
I've prepared for You!
STARLING
I feel weak...

ANGLE, ON STARLING, AS SHE TURNS BACK TOWARD LECHTER.
LECHTER
(IN THE KITCHEN)
The gift, of course is not the meal--
but the identification--which of us does
not need help?
The identity, of your
true enemy...?
...for you always sought to befriend, to
wish the love of those who wished you ill.
ANGLE, ON LECHTER, STANDING BEFORE THE FIGURE TIED TO THE
CHAIR.
LECHTER (cont'd)
Come here--he is in no pain, there are
no nerves in the brain, come here...
ANGLE, LECHTER'S POV THE FIGURE OF CRAWFORD TIED TO THE
CHAIR.
LECHTER MOVES TO HIM AND EXTRACTS FROM HIS UPPER POCKET, A

Come here, I'm going to cure you.

HER.
ANGLE
LECHTER, FRISKING THE FILTHY STARLING, TAKES OUT THE
MARINECORP HATBADGE, WHICH WE SAW EARLIER, HE BREAKS IT
OPEN, AND REVEALS A MICROTRANSMITTER.
LECHTER (cont'd)
Oh, no.
Oh, NO.
They've put a beeper on
you.
How careless of me.
How finally
careless, Do you think?
Have I erred on
Purpose?
Eh?
Or am I just unlucky?
Could one not say that's the essential
question of Philosophy...?
ANGLE ON STARLING, DAZED, LOOKING ON.
STARLING
Might I have some more of the wine...?
ANGLE ON LECHTER, AS HE MOVES TO A BACK WINDOW.
STARLING, AS SHE RISES, AGAIN, IN HER BALLGOWN.
STARLING (cont'd)
Because, I find I like the effects.
You
may say that it's inebriation, but it
seems
(SHE SMILES)
This lovely evening, in particular.... it
seems to reward me with clarity...
(SHE LAUGHS)
THERE IS A SOUND BEHIND HER.
THE BEAUTIFUL FRENCHDOORS
OPEN AND ADMIT A HAPPY COTERIE OF GOWNED WOMEN AND FORMAL
DRESSED MEN, THEY ARE ALL CHATTERING THEIR JOY AT SEEING
HER.
