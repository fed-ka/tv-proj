A mountain peak dominates the landscape.
TITLES BEGIN.
Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a
company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.
CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS
reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted
against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.
The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.
OFFICER
Dis-mount!
RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that
this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The
"Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.
One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,
bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.
FIRST SCOUT
Herman's horsesick!
A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored
hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite
for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his
uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.
SCOUTMASTER
Chaps, don't anybody wander off.
Some of the passageways in here
can run for miles.
Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.
CLIFFS - DAY
INDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.
He pausessquintsshields his eyeslooks in all directions.
INDY
Mister Havelock! Anybody
Everybody's lost but me!
He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER,
HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.
FEDORA
There he isl
MEN
(AD-LIBS)
Let's go! Let's get him! Let's
go!
Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy
puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy
puts the Cross in his belt.
INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But
the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a
standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his
back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.
FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into
the saddle and gallop off.
CONTINUED:
INDY
Hyahl Hyah!
ROSCOE
Hey! Come back here!
FEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK
AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two
more gang members). Now we glimpse...
THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT
The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm
is out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from
the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in
the truck.
PANAMA HAT
Come on. Get him!
INDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace
with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.
Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched
low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin
pumping.
INDY VEERS OFF in a new directiontoward a RAILROAD TRACK.
The train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over
his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he
LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.
He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from
the truck onto the train.
HALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed
runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked
on a flatcar.
INDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still
running after him, Indy enters the trap door of...
INDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks
worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and
tosses it away.
ROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at
him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...
INDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a
long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto
the roof of the rhino boxcar.
ROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle,
rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.
Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.
IN THE BOXCAR BELOW
... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the
commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS
HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.
BACK TO THE ROOFTOP
as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and
Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.
SMASH! The horn comes up againRIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.
INDY
Holy smokes!
INDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from
falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.
The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The
door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.
INDY gets to his feetlooks aheadsees a WATER TANK alongside the track
directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...
In an instant, he calculates his approachtimes the distanceand LEAPS for
the tank's WATER SPOUT.
CONTINUED:
He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A
FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout
deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks
up to see FEDORA walking toward him.
FEDORA
Come on, kid. There's no way
out of this.
As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF
COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.
FEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, "reels" INDY out of the
Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.
The men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to
face them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.
FEDORA
You've got heart, kid.
(indicates Cross)
But that belongs to me.
INDY
(takes Cross from his belt)
It belongs to Coronado.
FEDORA
(overlapping)
Coronado is dead. And so are all
his grandchildren.
INDY
This should be in a museum.
ROSCOE
Now give me thatl
ROSCOE makes a grab for the Crossbut INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war
ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS
AROUND Roscoe's hand.
ROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDERreleases his grip on the Cross and tries
to shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO
THE NEXT CAR.
FEDORA
Don't let him get awayl
INDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading
"DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."
INDY
Magic?
He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping
inside.
FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.
FEDORA
Hold it. Make sure he doesn't
double back.
as INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name
"JONES" painted on the mailbox.
INDY
Dad!
Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths.
INDY (V.O .)
Archaeology is...
INDY escapes through the garden.
INDY walks briskly toward the street; smiling, erUoying his freedom. As he
arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD SEDAN pulls up before him.
MAN (O.S.)
Doctor Jonesl
THREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them bespeaks "G-MAN."
The First Man steps behind Indy.
MAN
Doctor Jones?
A FORD COUPE speeds down the tree-lined street.
The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. INDY climbs from the car and
hurries up the walkway. BRODY is a step behind.
BRODY
Your father and I have been
friends since time began. I've
watched you grow up, Indy. And
I've watched the two of you grow
apart.
(beat)
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.
They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. They exchange a
quick look of concern as they enter.
A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN
CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY.
BRODY
Tell me, what's going to happen
when we get to Venice?
DONOVAN
(overlapping)
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will
be there to meet you.
CONTINUED:
BRODY
(overlapping)
Schneider?
DONOVAN
(overlapping)
I maintain an apartment in Venice,
at your disposal.
BRODY
Oh, well. That's good. Thank
you.
BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo.
He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.
DONOVAN
Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be
very careful. Don't trust anvbody.
SUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York City to Venice,
Italy.
DISSOLVE TO:
INDY and BRODY disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other
Gondoliers steer their boats in the water.
INDY
Ah, Venice...
BRODY
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize
this Doctor Schneider when we
see him?
INDY
I don't know. Maybe he'll know
us.
CONTINUED:
Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes
that are bright and intelligent.
ELSA
Doctor Jones?
INDY
Yes?
ELSA
I knew it was you
She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.
ELSA
you have your father's eyes.
INDY is instantly attracted to her.
INDY
And my mother's ears. But the
rest belongs to you.
ELSA
Looks like the best parts have
already been spoken for.
INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.
ELSA
Marcus Brody?
BRODY
That's right.
The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.
ELSA
(introducing herself)
Doctor Elsa Schneider.
INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.
BRODY
Uh... how do you do?
CUT TO:
INDY, BRODY and ELSA walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on
either side.
CONTINUED:
ELSA
The last time I saw your father
we were in the library. He was
very close to tracking down the
Knight's Tomb. I've never seen
him so excited. He was as giddy
as a schoolboy.
INDY
Who? Attila the Professor? He
was never giddy, even when he was
a schoolboy!
INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy
himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal,
Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.
INDY
Frauleinwill you permit me?
ELSA
I usually don't.
INDY
I usually don't either.
ELSA
In that case, I permit you.
INDY gives her the flower.
INDY
It would make me very happy.
ELSA
But I'm already sadby tomorrow
it will have faded.
INDY
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
BRODY
(cutting in)
I hate to interrupt youbut the
reason we're here
ELSA
(interrupting)
Yes. I have something to show
you.
She hands a slip of paper to INDY.
CONTINUED: (2)
ELSA
I left your father working in
the library. He sent me to the
map section to fetch an ancient
plan of the city. When I got back
to his tablehe'd gonewith
all his papersexcept for that
scrap which I found near his chair.
INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.
INDY
Roman numerals.
ELSA leads INDY and BRODY into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at
tables in front of a large building.
ELSA
Here is the library.
They have arrived at the front steps of the library.
INDY
That doesn't look much like a
library.
BRODY
It looks like a converted church.
ELSA leads the way inside.
The perfect picture postcardSt. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.
Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet
and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.
INDY
(wryly)
Ah, Venicel
Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH
AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.
He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP
INTO A MOTORBOAT.
Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of
the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.
KAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock.
They chase after INDY.
INDY grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in
the Agent's hand. It FIRES.
As INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him
and two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.
INDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.
INDY
(to ELSA)
Are you crazy?! You don't go
between them!
ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.
ELSA
Go between them? Are you crazy?!
INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard.
Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN
the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.
INDY
I said go around!
ELSA
You said go between them!
INDY
I said don't go between them!
It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom
up on either side of them like cavern walls.
One Enemy Speedboat chases INDY between the two Freighters. But the Speedboat
containing KAZIM veers off and goes around.
It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever closer to one another.
Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the Enemy
Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO
THE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.
INDY AND ELSA
spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear
racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at
INDY and ELSA.
KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT
matches Indy's move for move.
FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR
The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING
MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until
finally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.
The machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control
of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.
As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of
ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY
steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then
turns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins
helplessly in the churning water.
ELSA
No!!
INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back
into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the
Steamer's giant propeller blades.
INDY
Why are you trying to kill us?
KAZIM
Because you're looking for the
Holy Grail.
INDY
My father was looking for the
Holy Grail. Did you kill him
too?
KAZIM
No.
INDY
Where is he? Talkor you're
dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell
me!
KAZIM
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones,
we'll both die.
CONTINUED:
INDY
Then we'll die.
KAZIM
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are
getting closer.
INDY
This is your last chance.
KAZIM
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and
jumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of
time.
INDY
All right! Where's my father
KAZIM
If you let me go, I will tell you
where he is.
INDY
Who are you?
KAZIM
My name is Kazim.
INDY
And why were you trying to kill
me?
KAZIM
The secret of the Grail has been
safe for a thousand years. And
for all that time the Brotherhood
of the Cruciform Sword has been
prepared to do anything to keep
it safe.
KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it
is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of
a broadsword.
KAZIM
Let me get off at this jetty.
The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to
bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.
CONTINUED: (2)
KAZIM
Ask yourself, why do you seek
the Cup of Christ? Is it for His
glory, or for yours?
INDY
I didn't come for the Cup of
Christ. I came to find my father.
KAZIM
In that case, God be with you in
your quest. Your father is being
held in the Castle of Brunwald on
the Austrian-German border.
KAZIM walks away.
A GONDOLIER SINGS as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past
Indy's window.
A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves. This is
SUPERIMPOSED OVER A MAP that charts their course from Venice across Austria
toward Salzburg.
Storm clouds darken the skies. THUNDER EXPLODES in the
distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the
formidable stone castle.
INDY
What do you know about this
place?
ELSA
I know the Brunwalds are famous
art collectors.
INDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.
CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE
A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.
INDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet...
swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING
THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.
BRODY disembarks from the train along with the other PASSENGERS, a cross-
section of ARABS and TUSKS.
BRODY
Does anyone here speak English?
Or even ancient Greek?
A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.
BRODY
No water, no thank you. No, fish
make love in it.
BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman
holds a chicken out to him.
BRODY
Thank you so much. No, I don't
like that. No, I really don't
want... No, no, thank you very
much. No, thank you, madam.
I'm a vegetarian.
The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.
BRODY
Does anyone understand a word I'm
saying here?
SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.
SALLAH
Mister Brodyl
They meet and hug, then begin to walk.
BRODY
Oh, Sallahl What a relief!
SALLAH
(laughs)
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is
Indy?
BRODY
(overlapping)
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight
detour.
SALLAH
You are on your own?
A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.
CONTINUED:
BRODY
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's
under control. Have you. . .have
you arranged our supplies?
SALLAH
Oh, yes, of course. But where
are we going?
BRODY
Oh, this map will show you. It
was drawn by, uh...
BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.
SINISTER MAN
Mister Brody?
BRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and
bows quickly.
SINISTER MAN
Welcome to Iskenderun. The
Director of the Museum of
Antiquities has sent a car for
you.
BRODY takes off his hat.
BRODY
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
SALLAH
And I am his.
SINISTER MAN
Follow me, please.
The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them.
BRODY
My reputation precedes me.
SALLAH
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.
SECOND MAN
Papers please.
SALLAH
Papers?
(laughs)
Of course.
CONTINUED: (2)
SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY.
SALLAH
Run.
BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.
BRODY
Yes.
SALLAH
Papers, sir. Got it here.
SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.
SALLAH
Just finished reading it myself.
(laughs; then, to
Brody)
Run!
BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.
BRODY
Yes.
SALLAH
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.
(to Brody)
Run!
BRODY
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches
him through the newspaper.
SALLAH
Run!
The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY
begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The
STAND COLLAPSES on impact.
SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.
SALLAH
(to Brody; pointing)
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl
Hide in that doorl Hide in that
door!
SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a
ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into
the darkness.
CONTINUED: (3)
ThenMETAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has
actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.
SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall
dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside.
as ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI
SOLDIERS .
Another car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into
the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan.
LIEUTENANT
Etwas wichtig, mein Herr.
DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.
DONOVAN
Well, we have Marcus Brody. But
more important, we have the map.
A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for
DONOVAN.
CONTINUED:
RADIO OPERATOR
Aus Berlin, mein Herr.
DONOVAN
(reading)
"By the personal command of the
Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to
success. Eliminate the American
conspirators."
(to VOGEL)
Germany has declared war on the
Jones boys.
(to DRIVER)
Los fahren.
The car drives off.
INDY looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, but HENRY
appears worried.
INDY
Ha!
FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES
They chase down the road after INDY and HENRY.
INDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps
as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along
a higher road running in the same direction.
INDY approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the NAZI SOLDIERS
approaches from a higher road.
A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as INDY and
HENRY SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.
GUARD
Halt! Halt!
THE NAZI SOLDIER rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier--
IT SHATTERS.
INDY AND HENRY
INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar pastit snaps off in his hand.
The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He
unshoulders his machine gun.
INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his
motorcycle.
THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE
drives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse,
COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.
The remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen
comrades and continues the chase.
INDY AND HENRY
As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun,
preparing to fire.
INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the
Nazi's front wheel.
The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into
the air.
CONTINUED:
INDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to
see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the
way to BERLIN or VENEDIG.
Indy starts down the road marked VENEDIG.
HENRY
Stop!
INDY
What?
HENRY
Stop! Stop!
The motorbike skids to a stop.
HENRY
You're going the wrong Way!
We
have to get to Berlin!
INDY
(pointing towards
Venedig)
Brody's this way.
HENRY
My Diary's in Berlin.
INDY
You don't need the Diary, Dad.
Marcus has the map.
HENRY
There is more in the Diary than
just the map.
INDY
All right Dadtell me.
HENRY
Well, he who finds the Grail must
face the final challenge.
INDY
What final challenge?
HENRY
Three devices of such lethal
cunning.
INDY
Booby traps?
CONTINUED: (2)
HENRY
Oh, yes. But I found the clues
that will safely take us through,
in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
INDY
But what are they? Can't you
remember?
HENRY
I wrote them down in my Diary so
that I wouldn't have to remember
INDY
Half the German Army's on our
tail and you want me to go to
Berlin? Into the lion's den?
HENRY
Yes! The only thing that matters
is the Grail.
INDY
What about Marcus?
HENRY
Marcus would agree with me.
INDY
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus
Christl
HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any
means entirely by the blow itself.
HENRY
That's for blasphemy. The quest
for the Grail is not archaeology.
It's a race against evil.
If it is captured by the Nazis,
the armies of darkness will march
all over the face of the earth.
Do you understand me?
INDY
This is an obsession Dad. I never
understood it. Never. Neither
did Mom.
HENRY
Oh yes, she did. Only too well.
Unfortunately she kept her illness
from me until all I could do was
mourn her.
Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES
IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.
A Nazi Rallya book-burning is in process.
The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College
Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.
Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically
from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous
crowd.
INDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi
Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes
too big.
HENRY
My boy, we are Pilgrims in an
unholy land.
Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG
HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:
THE PODIUM
where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as
they oversee the rally.
ANOTHER ANGLE
ELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi
Officers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she
knows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.
INDY
Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?
Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her
thoughts.
ELSA
How did you get here?
INDY
Where is it? I want it.
INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the
Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.
CONTINUED:
ELSA
You came back for the book?
Whv?
INDY
My father didn't want it
incinerated.
She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.
ELSA
Is that what you think of me?
I believe in the Grail, not the
Swastika.
INDY
(vicious)
Yet you stood up to be counted
with the enemy of everything the
Grail stands forwho gives a
damn what you think?
ELSA
(hard and fast)
You do.
Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.
INDY
All I have to do is squeeze.
ELSA
All I have to do is scream.
It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And
the same goes for screaming.
INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He
moves over to HENRY.
INDY
I've got it. Let's get the hell
out of here.
They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage
coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's
signature.
HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It
only lasts a moment but the moment is electric.
HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first
page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.
Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.
VOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him,
revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at
the rising Zeppelin.
VOGEL
Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!
INDY climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as HENRY takes the tail gunner's
seat.
HENRY
(with delight)
I didn't know you could fly a
plane.
INDY
Fly--yes. Land--no.
The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE SKIDS and
CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending
a cloud of dust into the air.
As INDY pulls himself from the cockpit:
HENRY
(sarcastic)
Nice landing.
INDY
Thanks.
Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:
TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS
coming in low. Guns BLAZING.
As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone
barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.
HENRY
Those people are trying to kill
us!
INDY
I know, Dadl
HENRY
It's a new experience for me.
INDY
It happens to me all the time.
An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.
THE MAN
turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward,
startling the Old Man.
The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE.
The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING.
The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It
SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS.
The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the
road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and
EXPLODES in the middle of the road.
The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in
the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet.
THE CAR
FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.
DISSOLVE TO:
INDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY.
INDY
Dad, he's coming back.
INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:
A DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY
INDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his
pants. He opens the chamberthe GUN HAS NO BULLETS.
THE MESSERSCHMIDT
swings around and is coming in for another pass.
INDY AND HENRY
exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no
place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.
Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and
shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...
THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.
INDY
Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then
THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea
gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a
FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE
ENGINE.
ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies
and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.
INDY stands as beforestunneda statue.
HENRY walks back to INDY.
HENRY
I suddenly remembered Charlemagne.
"Let my armies be the rocks and the
trees and the birds in the sky."
(he chuckles)
INDY wears a proud expression as he watches HENRY walk down the beach.
FADE IN TITLE: "REPUBLIC OF HATAY"
FADE OUT TITLE.
The SULTAN is seated in his royal chair, flanked by WALTER DONOVAN and
VOGEL and surrounded by his minions.
DONOVAN holds the missing Grail Diary pages.
DONOVAN
These pages are taken from Professor
Jones' diary, Your Highness. And
they include a map that pinpoints
the exact location of the Grail.
DONOVAN and the SULTAN walk together through an archway.
DONOVAN
As you can see, the Grail is all
but in our hands.
(beat)
However, Your Highness, we
would not think of crossing your
soil without your permission,
nor of removing the Grail from
your borders without suitable
compensation.
CONTINUED:
SULTAN
What have you brought?
VOGEL
Bring den Schatzl
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They open the lid
and begin to empty it of its contents:
Gold and silver objects of every description.
DONOVAN
Precious valuables, Your Highness,
"donated" by some of the finest
families in all of Germany.
The SULTAN gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right
past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby.
SULTAN
Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3
litre, 30 horsepower, six cylinder
engine, with Stromberg Downdraft
carburetor.
The SULTAN points to the engine under the hood.
SULTAN
Can go from zero to 100 kilometres
an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I
even like the color.
DONOVAN
(after a beat)
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.
SULTAN
You shall have camels, horses, an
armed escort, provisions, desert
vehiclesand tanksl
DONOVAN
You're welcome.
Somebody else is also taking note...and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the
court.
ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.
ELSA
We have no time to lose. Indiana
Jones and his father have escaped.
SALLAH drives his car through the crowded streets, INDY beside him and HENRY
in the back seat.
SALLAH
We go this way.
SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.
SALLAH
Get that camel out of the way!
INDY
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
SALLAH
(overlapping)
Ah, they set out across the desert
this afternoon. I believe they
took Mister Brody with them.
HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.
HENRY
Now they have the map! And in
this sort of race, there's no
silver medal for finishing second.
Elsa and Donovan's partyconsisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, OPEN CAR, TUhKISH
SOLDIERS RIDING CAMELS, SPARE HORSES AND A TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER
VEHICLESall moving along through the ramble of this box canyon.
ELSA, DONOVAN and VOGEL travel in the open car. The TANK is a vintage World
War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish soldiers wear native dress and
carry both carbines and sabers.
BRODY sits alongside ELSA in the rear of the car carrying DONOVAN. Donovan
hands a canteen back to him.
DONOVAN
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
BRODY
I'd rather spit in your face.
But as I haven't got any spit...
VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.
VOGEL
We must be within three or four
miles. Otherwise we are off the
map.
CONTINUED:
He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to
DONOVAN.
DONOVAN
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink
of the recovery of the greatest
artifact in the history of mankind.
BRODY
You're meddling with powers you
cannot possibly comprehend.
HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the
distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.
INDY
Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay.
They've got a tank. Six-pound
gun.
Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.
What he sees is:
THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS
HENRY
What do you think you're doing?!
Get down!
INDY
Dad, we're well out of range.
At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.
It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and
SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them.
SALLAH
That car belonged to my brother-
in-law.
INDY
(gesturing to the
others)
Come on--come on!
VOGEL
I can't see anyone up there.
CONTINUED:
DONOVAN
Maybe it wasn't even Jones.
ELSA
No. It's him all right. He's
here somewhere.
DONOVAN
(to VOGEL)
Put Brody in the tank.
KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below.
DONOVAN
(to ELSA)
Well, in this sun, without
transportation, they're as good
as dead.
BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck.
A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him.
KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA
and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car.
DONOVAN
It's Jones, all right.
ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP
INDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch
Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them.
HENRY
Now, who are all these people?
INDY
Who cares? As long as they're
keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you
stay here while Sallah and I
organize some transportation.
CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the
DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE,
killing one of Kazim's Brethren.
The battle continuesa fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and
MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.
INDY AND SALLAH
crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst
camels and horses.
INDY
I'm going after those horses.
SALLAH
I'll take the camels.
INDY
I don't need camels.
SALLAH
But, Indy
INDY
No camels!
DONOVAN AND ELSA
They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet.
ELSA looks saddened.
DONOVAN
(re KAZIM)
Who is he?
KAZIM
A messenger from God. For the
unrighteous, the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.
KAZIM dies.
INDY
leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to
the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; INDY mounts the
horse, knocking both Turks to the ground.
DONOVAN
Not that Jonesthe other Jones!
NAZI SOLDIER
Herr Colonel!
INDY rides away on one horse, leading three others as he goes.
SALLAH approaches on horseback leading five camels.
INDY
Sallah, I said no camels! That's
five camels. Can't you Count?
SALLAH
Compensation for my brother-in-
law's car. Indy, your father and
Brody
INDY
Where's my father?
SALLAH
They have them. In the belly of
that steel beast.
INDY and SALLAH charge forward leading their horses and camels.
Then VOGEL commands the Tank Driver to give chase.
The tank starts firing at INDY on horseback. Indy zigs and zags as the tank fires
two rounds at Indy, barely missing him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume
of desert dust, hanging like a toadstool in the air.
DONOVAN shouts orders to the Troops. INDY is followed by various vehicles in
the caravan.
INDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far.
Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank,
turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.
POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT
VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with
INDY.
Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on
collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.
The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan
becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of
the six-pound cannon on the turret.
INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of
a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about
inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.
INDY gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging
several rocks inside. Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun.
INDY rides his horse alongside the tank.
INDY
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. VOGEL emerges
and aims his gun at INDY.
INDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse.
INDY pulls the trigger againhis gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the
high trail.
Now INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of
the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank.
CLOSE UP - VOGEL
Hate-staring at INDY
CLOSE UP - INDY
Hate-staring back at VOGEL.
Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy.
CUT TO:
SIDE ANGLE
One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a
galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY.
INDY is struggling with a German's Luger.
INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a
shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes
through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top
and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.
Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he
grabs INDY. They struggle and fall.
INDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's
neck.
A NAZI SOLDIER approaches.
INDY hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi Soldier screams as he
is dragged under the rolling tank.
Now INDY and VOGEL struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around
Indy's neck.
INDY now lies on top of VOGEL. He kicks out at the periscope which spins
around.
VOGEL holds the chain around INDY's neck, pushing his head downward toward
the revolving tread.
A troop truck pulls near the tank.
The EXPLOSION knocks INDY off the tank and onto the tread. He grabs onto the
shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank.
VOGEL looks down at INDY and smiles smugly.
The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As INDY tries to secure footing, VOGEL
steps on his hands.
VOGEL now swings a shovel at INDY, smashing at his hands.
BRODY climbs up out of the tank, followed by HENRY.
CONTINUED:
HENRY
Didn't I tell you it was a rescue,
huh?
A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls HENRY down.
VOGEL raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on INDY,
still hanging from the protruding gun.
INDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of
his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending
stones tumbling down over him.
INDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely
missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull
himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then
peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank.
INDY
Dad?
HENRY
You call this archaeology?
INDY
Get out of there, Dad!
INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the
tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs
Vogel's arm.
BRODY
How does one get off this thing?
As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the
backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.
HENRY
(to INDY)
Where's Marcus?!
Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks
but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving
tread.
INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside.
As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with
lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around
Henry's right ankle.
INDY
Dad!
HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto
the end of the bullwhip.
INDY
Hang on, Dad!
SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.
SALLAH
Father of Indygive me your
hand!
VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still,
INDY refuses to let go of the whip.
INDY
Sallah! Get Dadl
SALLAH reaches out to HENRY.
SALLAH
Give me your hand!
SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the
cliff's edge.
INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away
from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.
INDY
looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.
We SEE his
HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.
VOGEL
He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top
of his lungs!
LONG SHOT
The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.
HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage
of the tank.
HENRY
Junior?!
We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.
SALLAH
Indy?!
HENRY
Oh, God. I've lost him. And I
never told him anything. I just
wasn't ready, Marcus. Five
minutes would have been enough.
And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM.
He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below
with a bewildered expression.
Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.
HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he
throws his arms around him.
HENRY
I thought I'd lost you, boy.
After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's
embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him.
He hugs his father back.
INDY
I thought you had too, sir.
BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.
HENRY
Wellwell done! Come on!
HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff
edge.
CONTINUED:
Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to
see INDY still sitting on the ground.
HENRY
Let's go then. why are you
sitting there resting when we're
so near the end? Come on
let's go!
HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly
the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet.
DONOVAN peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE CRESCENT
MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to ELSA.
DONOVAN
The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Now ELSA peers through the binoculars.
INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING
WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger.
Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian
facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles,
camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance.
CUT TO:
INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY emerge from the Mountain Temple through
the Grecian Facade.
From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN IS HEARD. A
cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance.
HENRY turns to INDY.
HENRY
Elsa never really believed in the
Grail. She thought she'd found a
prize.
INDY
What did vou find, Dad?
HENRY
Me?... Illumination.
HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son.
HENRY
What did you find, Junior?
INDY
Junior?! Dad...
SALLAH
Please...What does it always
mean, this...this "Junior?"
HENRY
That's his name. Henry Jones,
Junior.
INDY
I like Indiana.
HENRY
We named the dog Indiana.
BRODY
May we go home now, please?
CONTINUED:
SALLAH
(to INDY)
The dog!?
(laughs)
You are named after the dog...
INDY
(embarrassed)
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.
A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh
at INDY.
INDY
Ready?
HENRY
Ready.
BRODY
Indy! Henryl Follow met I know
the way!
(to his horse)
Haaa!
HENRY
(to INDY)
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
INDY
Uh-huh.
HENRY
After you, Junior.
INDY
Yes, sir!
(to his horse)
Haaa!
They THUNDER through the canyonwhose towering walls threaten to collapse
upon them.
as BRODY, INDY, HENRY AND SALLAH ride from the canyon toward the SETTING
SUN.
