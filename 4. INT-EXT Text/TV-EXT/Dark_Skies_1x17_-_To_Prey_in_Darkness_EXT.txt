      The city is alive with humanity, and a few other things.  A
      SUPER orients us:

                           November 5, 1965
                       Greenwich Village, New York



      A city that's always having a party is about to have more
      guests tracking their dirt on the carpet.



      Loengard and Juliet sit in a rented sedan.  Loengard checks a
      file labeled, "HERTZOG, DR. CARL A.", sliding out a
        surveillance photo of the house.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Looks like the place.

                                      JULIET
                          (briefing him)
                    Hertzog might still believe you're
                    on the run from Majestic.
                          (pointedly)
                    He'll want to help you -- if you use
                    the right approach.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You sound like Bach.

      Loengard starts to exit.  Juliet places a hand on his forearm.

                                      JULIET
                    John...
                          (beat)
                    If he took the film, he could turn
                      desperate.  Your weapon should be
                    ready.

      Loengard has had enough.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                10.


                                      LOENGARD
                    All Doc ever wanted to do was practice
                    medicine.  He just got sucked into
                    the kind they never taught him about
                    at school. 

                                      JULIET
                    It's not about who's at fault.

                                      LOENGARD
                    Point is, Juliet, that even if he
                    did take this film, I'm not going to
                    shoot him.

      Loengard exits, slamming the car door.  Juliet watches him
      head up the walkway.



      Loengard approaches, rings the doorbell.  A beat, the door
      opens a crack.  Inside, DR. CARL HERTZOG peeks through, then
      opens the door just enough.  He's grey and wrinkled, but not
      yet feeble.

                                      HERTZOG
                    John?  You're alive! 

                                      LOENGARD
                    Hey, Doc.

                                      HERTZOG
                    How did you find me?  Only Majestic
                    knows where I am.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I went back to your old place in
                      Georgetown, told your neighbor I was
                    your grandson.
                          (shrugs shoulders)
                    Here I am, gramps.

      Hertzog considers this a moment, then:

                                      HERTZOG
                    Get inside.

      Hertzog opens the door just enough, then practically pulls
      Loengard through it by grabbing at his shirt.



      Loengard sits in the front seat with Juliet, checking his
      watch.

                                      LOENGARD
                    I told him to be packed in an hour. 
                    What's taking him?

                                      JULIET
                    You're risking too much here.

                                      LOENGARD
                      I wouldn't have been if you hadn't
                    called it in right away.  You could
                    have given the man some time.

      Juliet looks at him as if she can't quite believe what she's
      hearing.

                                      JULIET
                    I will wait five more minutes.  Then
                    I'm going to the airport.  With or
                    without you.

                                      LOENGARD
                    You know, you're all heart.



      Loengard knocks.  No answer.  He begins to suspect the worst. 
      He pulls his gun, goes inside.



      The familiar skyline tells us we are back in New York.



      Loengard emerges from the apartment building side door.  At
      the street side of the alley, he sees Steele getting in a
      car.  He begins to chase after it.

      His last image is Kim Sayers, looking in her rear view mirror,
      driving away from him, as we:

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:



      There is no 500-channel universe.  There are only the Big
      Three networks.  This is the one where Walter, Dan and William
      S. worked together.



      A light descends from the twilight sky like a shooting star
      over an isolated mountain range stitched together with power
      lines ...

      BRZZZZZZZ!  A BRIGHT BLUE BEAM of light illuminates a single
      power pole.  From above, A FLYING SAUCER lowers into visible
      position above the power pole ... the light turns from blue
      to purple and -- KABOOOOOOOSH!  The transformer explodes.    DARK SKIES      "To Prey In Darkness"      Bryce Zabel                                                49.



      The clear satellite imagery we expect today, but was unheard
      of in 1965.  So, our POV is purchased with somebody else's
      technology.

      On the Hive monitor, city by city, the entire GREAT POWER
      BLACK-OUT OF '65 begins to plunge millions of people into
      complete darkness.  Rolling down the coast from North to South.
