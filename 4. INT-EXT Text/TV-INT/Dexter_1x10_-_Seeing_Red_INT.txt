    CLOSE on a LOCKSMITH changing out the locks in the kitchen.  
    Nearby, DEXTER stuffs lunch boxes into backpacks.  Behind 
    him, CODY and ASTOR finish bowls of cereal at the table.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      I m very good at problem solving.  I 
                        take ugly messes and find permanent, 
                        albeit bloody, solutions.  

    Dexter turns toward the table and claps his hands.

                        problems, I go with a lighter touch.  

    As the kids rise from the table and take their backpacks 
    from Dexter, RITA barrels into the kitchen, half-dressed in 
    a blouse and slip.

    Rita exhales and leans against a counter, still shaken from 
    last night s violent encounter with Paul.  Dexter turns to 
    Astor and Cody.

    the can and gives Dexter a grateful hug.

    The elevator door opens and Dexter, full HazMatsuit now, 
    steps out past TWO COPS standing guard.  Dexter trudges 
    alone down the long hallway toward Room 103, blood kit in

    A nightmare.  BLOOD is streaked and smeared everywhere -- on 
    the walls, the ceiling.  The carpet is a glistening SEA OF 
    RED.  It looks like a massacre happened here, but there are 
    no bodies in sight.

    Dexter barely registers this, before his body stiffens in an 
    epic anxiety attack.  Gasping, his legs go weak and he falls 
    forward, landing with a splash in the blood.  On his hands 
    and knees, he slips.  Can t stand.  Panics.  As he lifts his 
    head, the bloody room DARKENS, and we --

    Only this time, we WIDEN to reveal that he s sitting in a

    coming... just eerie shadows and glistening pools of blood,

    Dexter, on his feet now, stumbles backwards out of Room 103.  
    His heart pounds and he gasps for breath, his white HazMat
    suit streaked in blood.

                      me last night.  My boyfriend filed a

    Off Rita, trying to hold it together...


    A FORENSIC TECH in a bunny suit cuts out a SWATCH OF BLOOD-
    SOAKED CARPET and seals it into a bag for later analysis.  
    Another TECH uses a WET-VACto suck up excess blood, so a 
      similarly-attired PHOTOGRAPHER can snap a photo of bloody 
    FOOTPRINT impressions left under the swatch.  

    SEVERAL FEET AWAY 

    A TECH fills a syringe with blood from under a night stand.  
    He packs the vial into an IGLOO COOLER with dozens of other 
    vials.  Masuka treads by in his bunny suit, giving orders.

                                        MASUKA
                        Make sure you label the section of the 
                        grid each blood sample came from.

    Masuka moves over to the area by the TV and stares at a 
    blood-drenched wall in fascination.  A closer look reveals 
    the bloody smears are composed of tiny MIST-LIKE DROPS.

                                        MASUKA
                      You should really get in here, Dex.  
                        I ve never seen anything like this.

    A disembodied voice comes back to him.

    Dexter sits on the floor in his bunny suit, back against the 
    other side of the wall, deep breathing to keep it together.

                        Sometimes you can get too close to a

                      the answer into focus.

    Masuka leans outside into the hallway.

                      And how come the blood isn t clotting?

    Dexter s cell phone RINGS.  He stands up, awkwardly tries to 
    fish it out of his cumbersome bunny suit, nearly dropping it 
    into the suit s foot cavity before managing to answer.

                        ones.  They re charging me with a 
                        class-two felony.

    As Dexter listens, he hazards a glance into Room 103.  
    Instantly, his head starts swimming again.

    Dexter hangs up, then exhales.  He calls out to Masuka,

                      the far wall.  Something looks off.  

    Masuka walks to a section of wall so red it looks PAINTED 
    WITH BLOOD.  He squats and peers closer.  REVEAL a VOID OF 
    BLOODaround the socket.

                        plugged in here.  Probably a power

    Dexter enters to snoop, reacting again to an INFANT CRYING,

    Two porterhouse steaks sizzle in a pan.  Rudy, holding a 
    beer, rummages through drawers, searching through various 
    sharp utensils.  Dexter painfully watches.

                                        RUDY

    Rudy slams closed one drawer and opens another to search.

                      You wouldn t happen to have a good 
                        meat knife? 

    Dexter opens a drawer, pulls out a MEAT KNIFE, and hands it 
    to Rudy.  As he talks, Rudy casually waves the knife for 
    emphasis.

                                        RUDY 
                        Anyway, the other part of the argument 
                      was about you.

                        Yeah, it was already tense, but when I 
                        brought your name up, she lost it.

    Dexter considers this for a moment.

                      Deb doesn t like to feel left out.

                        Tell her it was all your fault.

                        Seriously?

                                        DEXTER
                      You will eventually.  Deb has a way of 
                        wearing you down.  So just start from 
                        that place.  It saves time.

    Rudy s cell phone RINGS.  He looks at the caller ID.

                                        RUDY
                        Sorry, gotta take this.

    Rudy puts down the knife and steps outside to take the call.


    Debra sits behind her desk, glumly going over files.

                        right.  I was mad at Dexter and took 
                      it all out on you.  My shift s almost 
                        done.  Can you come over and talk?

                      I d love to, Babe, but I m about to 
                      eat dinner with Dexter.

    There s an uncomfortable pause, as Debra bites her tongue.

                                        DEBRA 
                        Well, then after.  I ll wait up.

    Rudy turns off his cell and heads back inside.

    The DJplays slow and seductivemusic.  Batista sits alone, 
    dressed in a crisp suit and tie.  He spots a SEXY WOMAN and 
    they exchange a glance.  He takes a deep breath, pockets his

    Batista smiles, takes her hand, and leads her onto the --

    Where Batista starts out cold, his nervous energy making 
    their chemistry awkward.  But as the music builds, he 
    becomes smoother, more expert, and soon he s twirling her 
    around the room effortlessly, smiling ear to ear.

    The Sexy Woman can t believe it.  Who s this guy?She gasps 
    as the moves become more intricate.  Batista literally 
    sweeps her off her feet and into a dramatic clench.  A kiss

    Batista spots an OLDER GUY dancing with the beautiful woman,

    She smiles but seems a bit put off.  As Batista pulls 
    Monique aside, the Older Guy with her slips away.

                        Well you gotta give me something soon.  
                        This department can t afford another 
                        public relations disaster.

    LaGuerta sees her opportunity.  She takes a chance.

                        Then tell the D.A.to let Neil Perry 
                      go.  He s not the Ice Truck Killer.

                      The D.A.takes his cues from us.  If

                        straight to me.

    Matthews exits.  LaGuerta, holding an ace up her sleeve, 
    calmly returns to the work on her desk.

    Off the WHINE of a tile saw...


    PAN a collection of POWER TOOLS dripping viscous red liquid.  
    Like the devil s workshop.  We reach Dexter, wearing plastic 
    coveralls and clear goggles.  He dips a TILE SAW into a tray 
    of RED PAINT and lets the blade rip, spraying the walls and 
    ceiling with red.

    After a beat, Dexter stops the blade, removes the goggles, 
    and looks around.  The walls are covered by rolls of white 
    paper, with red spatter remarkably similar to Room 103.

    BLOOD.  The Uniform Cop leaves.

                        involved.

    Dexter pulls off a glove, reaches into his pocket, and hands 
    Rudy his cell phone.

    Dexter walks Rudy toward the elevator, laughing and joking.  
    Her jaw tightens in anger.

    His reproachful look tells her it is a verybig deal.  He 
    turns to the prosecutor.

    Rudy works on an artificial foot.  Surrounded by prosthetic 
    tools, partial limbs and paraphernalia.  Batista steps 
    through the open door and extends his hand.

                                        BATISTA
                      You Rudy Cooper?  Angel Batista.  I 
                        work with your girlfriend, Deb.

                                        BATISTA
                      I d like to ask you a few questions, 
                      if you don t mind.

                                        RUDY
                        Sure.  Let me just shut the door.  

    Rudy walks to the door, covertly glances down the hall to 
    see if anyone saw Batista enter, then closes the door. 

                                        RUDY
                        Would this be related to a case?

                                        BATISTA
                      You could say that.

                                        RUDY 
                        Wow.  Okay, so fire away.

    Rudy casually returns to his work on the artificial foot, 
    his back to Batista.

                                        BATISTA
                        I ran into this lady with a prosthetic 
                        hand, a call-girl actually.  Said she 
                      had a very unique client... an amputee 
                        devotee.

    As Batista talks, Rudy s hand finds a heavy METAL ROD among 
    the junk on his work counter.  He slowly wraps his fingers 
    around the metal, ready to strike.

                                        RUDY
                      You have a lead on this client?

                        I thought you might be able to steer 
                      me toward some of those weirdos.

    Relieved, Rudy releases his grip on the metal rod.  He turns 
    to Batista and smiles, warm and gracious as can be.

                                        RUDY 
                        Afraid I got into this business to

                      Oh, that dbe great.

                                        RUDY
                        Hey, how often you get a chance to 
                        help catch a bad guy, right?

                                        BATISTA
                      No no, I m good.  I m chasing a long 
                        shot really.  Just give me a call at

    Batista hands Rudy a BUSINESS CARD.

                        Will do.

    Batista glances around in genuine wonder at the menagerie of 
    prosthetics gear and walks out.  When he s gone, Rudy opens 
    a drawer -- revealing bottles of multi-colored FINGERNAIL 
    POLISH -- drops the card inside, and closes the drawer.


    CLOSE on the front door.  It bursts open and Astor charges

    Paul pulls Rita aside.

    see coming, and hedrops like a brick.  Dexter stares down.

    satchel of killing saws and knives and pulls out a SYRINGE.  
    He taps syringe and clears the air bubbles.

    A reporter calls out a question.

                        What about Neil Perry?  Wasn t he 
                        supposed to be the Ice Truck Killer?

                        Those questions should be directed to 
                        Captain Matthews.  He s been 
                        personally handling the Perry case.

    BACK IN THE BULLPEN

    More buzzing.  A steely voice cuts through the chatter --

                      Who knew?

    REVEAL Captain Matthews standing behind the detectives now, 
    watching the news on the TV screen.

                      it, Captain.

    Everyone in the room quiets.  Tries to avoid the Captain s 
    withering stare.  Off Matthews, doing a slow burn...


    LaGuerta sits at her desk, quietly filling out paperwork.  
    Captain Matthews enters and closes the door.  For a moment, 
    the two just stare at each other.  Matthews stays calm.

                                        CAPTAIN MATTHEWS

    Matthews turns and exits.  Off LaGuerta, suddenly unsure of 
    what she just unleashed...


    Dexter sets down dinner plates around the table.  He warily 
    keeps his eye on the front door. 

    DEXTER S POV

    Rita talks with her Lawyer in the foyer.  After a beat, the 
    Lawyer smiles, shakes her hand and exits.  Rita closes the 
    door then slumps against it, sobbing.  

    Dexter approaches worried.

    And then, her tears turn into a weird, wonderful laughter.

    She pulls her children into a tightly wound ball of hugs.

                      It is truly amazing, the things you

    Paul lies on the bed, looking stoned.  His arm is TIED OFF.  
    A SYRINGE OF HEROINhangs from his vein.  A GUN, a BAG OF 
    HEROIN, RUBBER TUBING, a BLACKENED SPOON, and a LIGHTER 
    TORCHare sprawled on a bedside table.  There s a POUNDING 
    on the door.

                        Police!  Open up!

    Paul stirs awake, blurry, incoherent.  TheTV BLARES and RED 
    POLICE LIGHTS flash through the curtained window.

                        will do just fine, thanks to Batista s

                        Code of Harry remains unbroken.

    Paul looks around in confusion, his mind still mired in a 
    heroin fog.  The silhouettes of two cops are at the door...

                                                                              RESUME:

    Batista pulls into his parking space and gets out.  He opens 
    the back seat and grabs a couple bags of groceries.  As he 
    stands, Batista sees a reflection in the glass behind him--

    REVEAL 

    An eerie FIGURE -- face hidden by a flesh-toned stocking and 
    cap over his head -- raises a WICKED KNIFE to cut Batista s 
    throat.

    With no time to think, Batista instinctively THRUSTS his 
    head backward into the face of his attacker, knocking him 
    off balance -- but not before the attacker DRIVES his knife 
    deep into the side of Batista, who drops his groceries.

    The attacker falls into an SUV, setting off the CAR ALARM.  
    Batista, bleeding heavilyand collapsing, fumbles for his gun.

    TWO YOUNG MEN

    Horsing around and laughing, emerge from a stairwell and see 
    the attacker climbing to his feet and reaching for aknife.

    THE ATTACKER

    Blood soaks through the stocking, where Batista head-butted 
    his mouth.  The attacker sees the young men running his way.  
    He needs to finish the job with Batista, but realizes he 
    doesn t have time.  With no options, he takes off running.

    As the two young men reach Batista, who lies on the ground 
    in a fast-spreading pool of blood...


    Debra and Doakes gather their things to head out.

    Debra looks up and smiles.  For a moment, Doakes thinks the 
    smile is for him.  Then he looks over his shoulder to see --

    RUDY

    standing in the hallway with a bouquet of WHITE ROSES, 
    waiting for Debra.  She stares at him.  He stares back.  
    Rudy enters the bullpen, and Doakes quietly slips away.

                        Rita s ex-husband taught me something.  
                        Problems don t go away by themselves.  
                        Sometimes they require... creative 
                        solutions.  I found one for Paul.  Now 
                        it s my turn.

    The elevator DINGS and the door opens.  With dread, Dexter 
    stares out at --


    Dexter nervously steps off the elevator and walks down the 
    long hallway.  His heart pounds. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      So this is doom.  I ve been the 
                        architect of so much of it, it s only 
                        fair I should know what all the fuss 
                      is about.  

    He reaches the door and stares at the room number: 103.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      He left me this room for a reason.  
                        Five women gave their blood, their 
                        lives, for this moment.  There s only 
                      one way to find out why.

    He ducks under the YELLOW POLICE TAPE and opens the door.

                      The belly of the beast.  

    Dexter takes a deep breath and enters, eyes cast downward.  
    He maneuvers through the scaffolding and sits on the floor 
    as the boy in his memory sat.  Dexter raises his head to 
    look at the bloodywalls.  Instantly, the room SWIRLS--

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


    The boy sitting in blood wails.  We see the whole picture 
    this time.        DEXTER 110        "Seeing Red"     Final Draft -- 9/20/06       60.

    The images are clearer, the details in sharper focus.  A 
    DEAD MANlies nearby, face down in inch-deep blood.  Around 
    him are more DEAD BODIES.  And BODY PARTS.

    THREE-YEAR-OLD DEXTER S POV

    A WOMAN,sprayed in blood, is held by a LARGE COLUMBIANMAN.

                                        WOMAN
                        Honey, don t cry.  Please don t cry.

    Another MAN steps into view and strikes the woman.  She 
    collapses into the blood.  Three-year-old Dexter wails.

                                        WOMAN 
                        Don t kill me.  Please.  I ll give it 
                        back.  I swear...

    A THIRD MAN pulls the cord on a CHAINSAW.  Over and over.

                                        WOMAN 
                      No!  No no!  Not in front of my baby!
                                (desperateto Dexter)
                        Don t look!  Don t look, honey!  Cover 
                      you eyes!

    Finally the engine catches and the blade ROARS.

                                          THREE-YEAR-OLD DEXTER
                        Mommy!  Mommy...!

    We hear her SCREAMS.  The chainsaw hits bone and GRINDS.  As 
    the blood SPRAYS THE WALLS around the helpless boy...

                                                                              RESUME:


    An OVERHEAD SHOT of Dexter.  Lying on his back.  Looking up 
    at us.  With tears streaming down his cheeks --

                                                                    SLAM TO BLACK.
