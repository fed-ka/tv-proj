               Morning establishing.


               The big yellow school bus drives down the road, past a sign 
               that reads 'Denver - 45 miles'.


               The school bus pulls up to the immaculate, glass building.

               The large stage (from Weight Gain 4000) is again set up in 
               the middle of town. The Mayor addresses the large crowd of 
               townspeople.

                                     MAYOR
                         Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed 
                         a great week for South Park. Ms. 
                         Hermans has opened the East wing of 
                         the library, and our own South Park 
                         Cows Elementary school dodgeball 
                         team is going to the national finals! 
                         Where they will undoubtedly be beaten 
                         senseless by the Washington team.

               The townspeople cheer.

                                     MAYOR
                         But most importantly, this week has 
                         brought to my attention a very serious 
                         and dreaded disease. Conjoined Twin 
                         Myslexia.

                                     MAYOR
                         And so it is in honor of this, that 
                         I declare this exciting week as 
                         'Conjoined Twin Myselxia Week'!

               The crowd cheers.

                                     MAYOR
                         And now, let's kick off our week 
                         long festivities with the first annual 
                         'Grand Conjoined Parade'!

               PARADE MUSIC begins. We can see a parade route, and everybody 
               standing on the sidewalks to get a view.

                                     MAYOR
                         Let's hear it for these brave souls!!

               The parade music gets louder, and Nurse Gollem, all by 
               herself, walks through frame, waving to a couple people 
               halfheartedly.

               As she walks out of frame, the parade music gets softer.

                                     MAYOR
                         What a glorious parade that was!! 
                         Let's hear it for the parade 
                         coordinators!!

               The mayor gestures to about eleven guys in suits, who stand 
               up and take a bow. Everyone applauds.

                                     NURSE
                         You know, Mayor, I really should be 
                         accompanying those kids to Washington 
                         in case they get hurt. That IS my 
                         job.

                                     MAYOR
                         Nonsense! This is YOUR week! You 
                         aren't going anywhere!


               Establishing.

               The school bus drives in and plows right into the side of 
               the Vietnam memorial.


               A lot of people have showed up for the big game. Chef and 
               the kids walk in to the large, decorated auditorium.

                                     CHEF
                         Damn man, this is the big time 
                         alright...

                                     STAN
                         Chef, we're hungry.

                                     CHEF
                         You can eat after the game. You 
                         children win this one and your 
                         national champions! Then you go on 
                         and play the Chinese.

                         My mom says there's a lot of black 
                         people in China.

                                     CHEF
                         What?

               But Chef is interrupted by a geeky looking referee.

                                     REFEREE
                         Are you Chef?

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah.

                                     REFEREE
                         The Washington team has forfeited 
                         the game. Congratulations, you're 
                         national champions.

                                     CHEF
                         What?! WE DID IT, CHILDREN WE WON!!

               TRIUMPHANT MUSIC.

                                     KYLE
                         Wow, that was easy.

               The crowd boos.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, let's hear a 
                         round of applause for the new national 
                         champions of dodgeball... THE SOUTH 
                         PARK COWS!!!

               Everyone Cheers halfheartedly.

               Stan and the boys walk over to the Washington bench, where 
               all the kids are getting ready to leave.

                                     STAN
                         Hey, why did you guys forfeit?

                                     WASHINGTON KID
                         You mean you don't know?

                         Know what?

               The lights dim... OMINOUS MUSIC begins.

                                     WASHINGTON KID
                         Last year's national champions were 
                         the Austin Pirates. They played China 
                         for the world championship... Only 
                         four of them came back alive.

               The boys eyes pop.

                                     WASHINGTON KID
                         The Chinese dodgeball players aren't

               The big, yellow school bus pulls up in front of the shitty 
               little Chinese school.


               On the stage, the Mayor again takes her place at the 
               microphone.

                                     MAYOR
                         Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth 
                         day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia week, 
                         all our prayers are with our little 
                         South Park Cows now playing their 
                         hearts out in China. Now, join me in 
                         saluting our Cows, and help make 
                         Nurse Gollem not feel like an outcast, 
                         with our first official CONJOINED 
                         TWIN MYSLEXIA HATS!!

               The mayor puts a hat on her head, that says 'go cows' and 
               also has a large plastic fetus hanging off the side. The 
               townspeople follow suit, putting on their ridiculous looking 
               hats. Now everybody has a little fetus hanging off their 
               head.

               Nurse Gollem can't believe her eyes.


               Establishing. Time passes.
