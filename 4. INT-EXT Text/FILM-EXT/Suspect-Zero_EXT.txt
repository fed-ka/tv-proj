Amongst the refuse is a discarded MILK CARTON, resting on its
back. The carton asks "Have You Seen Me?" above a photographed
face that's been obscured by grime.
Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... in
that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows through
it all. We stay with the carton...
Then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE grows
in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts
off and whips past us.
...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the
corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness.
Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. The
milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed.
A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime washes
away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. "Have
You Seen Me?" It's heartbreaking.
TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35:
concrete forever. In the distance, gray highway yields to
black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie.
A vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them.
CUT TO:
...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee.

Speck hurries out to his Buick, checking over his shoulder
repeatedly. Gets to the car, fumbles with his keys. They fall
to the asphalt. He grabs them, opens the door.
CUT TO:

Your standard roadside rest-stop: a parking lot with weeds
poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near. Those
STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now...
POLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site.
Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He and Mackelway get out.
Two men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; and his deputy, BUD
GRANGER, a gangly, baby-faced pup.
DYLAN
Afternoon, Rick.
(Charlton nods)
Looks like a robbery/homicide. Body's
over that way.
10.
He gestures toward a ravine, where a TOW TRUCK is currently
lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle.
It is Harold Speck's Buick, nose-down in the ravine, teetering
on a rock, like the balanced scales of justice.
MACKELWAY
Ya run the plates?
Charlton eyes Mackelway: "Easy, Hot-shot." Mackelway nods,
reminding himself to remember his new rank. Dylan hands a
preliminary report to Charlton.
DYLAN
Fella's name is Harold Speck. Traveling
salesman, from Abilene.
Charlton eyes the report, then hands it to Mackelway. The
hierarchy is being made clear. Very.
Mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a SIGN that
reads "Welcome to Texas" on one side and "You are now leaving
Oklahoma" on the other.
A vehicle, left right on the state-line. Odd...
Then, a NOISE: that Tow-Truck WINCH, grinding badly. It's just
about to yank the Buick out of this ditch.
MACKELWAY
(it blurts out)
Hey!
Before Charlton can react, Mackelway is running across this
weed-choked lot, zeroing in on the TOW-TRUCK DRIVER.
10
10
The Driver, JUMBO, is operating the winch from a hydraulic
handle on the back of the truck. Mackelway barrels in:
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
What the fuck're you doing?!
JUMBO
What's it look like, Bud?
Mackelway reaches past Jumbo and hits the "Stop" button
himself. The winch shuts down. Mackelway turns. A handful of
LOCAL COPS stand atop this ravine, watching.
11.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
You guys ever heard of evidentiary
procedure?
No one replies. Charlton approaches. Mackelway tightens,
expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds.
MACKWELWAY (CONT'D)
Sorry, Sir. There wasn't time.
Charlton eyes the car. Then Mackelway.
CHARLTON
Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway.
Let's have a look.
Charlton starts down the embankment. Mackelway doesn't,
hanging back as he eyes the TRACKS this Buick made before
tumbling. Something about them...
He pulls a small CAMERA from his pocket, a Minox. Snaps off a
few photos of the scene - the Buick, the ravine, those tracks,
some FOOTPRINTS alongside them.
Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment.
11
11
It's an ugly sight. Speck is inches from us, but his head is
facing in the other direction, twisted unnaturally.
Mackelway kneels beside the open window, pulls out some
gloves, puts them on. He will not lean on the car, or even
breathe on it, his caution around evidence obvious.
CHARLTON (O.S.)
What's that?
Charlton is opposite him, outside the passenger-side window,
pointing at the DRAWING that O'Ryan had tossed onto Speck's
lap. It lies face down on the seat.
But something's been FINGER-PAINTED on the back of it: A
RED CIRCLE, with a SLASH through it.
Charlton begins to reach for it, when:
MACKELWAY
(to stop him)
Sir?
Charlton stops. Mackelway indicates: "Gloves."
12.
Charlton eyes him. It's irritating being corrected by a guy
you outrank, especially when he's right.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Sort of a... stickler for procedure.
CHARLTON
I imagine you would be.
That was a jab, but we don't know it yet. Charlton puts on his
gloves. Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox,
looking over the rest of this car, as:
GRANGER
(aloud)
Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar.
Granger's by the trunk. Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo
has tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment: a
ten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us.
Everybody ducks... as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick.
Jumbo shrugs.
JUMBO
You said toss it.
Mackelway shakes his head. "Shitkicker." Granger grabs the
crowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as:
MACKELWAY
Hold it a second.
Granger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off
a few shots with the Minox.
Something catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He
kneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a
thin line on top of the paint in a single post.
He takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it.
Then he sniffs it. Pauses...
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Smells like... clove.
He looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk.
DYLAN
(re: Mackelway)
Where the hell'd you find this guy?
13.
CHARLTON
Field Office. Dallas.
DYLAN
(impressed)
Well now...
(Charlton shrugs)
So what the hell's he doin' here?
That one is left unanswered. Granger opens the trunk.
Mackelway and the others look inside...
There, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt-
shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel... And a
fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet.
Mackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's
nothing significant here. So he returns to Speck's body.
He leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the
steering wheel. Gently.
...which is when we learn that Speck's EYELIDS have been torn
off. It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly. Charlton
leans in, gets a look.
CHARLTON
Christ...
Mackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS
EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed
into a series of dark, disjointed images:
12
12
Seems like we're standing in a field of TALL WHEAT; we can't
say for sure. Everything's wet, wind-whipped.
A MUZZLE FLASH... Someone just fired a gun. We slump hard to
the ground. Then we look up.
Mackelway stands over us, his face wet with rain. Then, just
as quickly, those IMAGES VANISH and we are:
13
14
Picket fence, a swing on the porch, a lawn that needs mowing.
A LINE OF PEOPLE file in, each bringing food... and tissues to
cry into.
15
16
This time, everything before us is a blur of gray. We hear
that wet wind. We hear our own heavy BREATHING, as if we were
running somewhere... a VOICE, rising above the wind, seems to
be saying:
(O.S.)
Please...
The sound echoes oddly, as if bouncing off a satellite
somewhere, or a distance of time and space.
Then the sound and the soupy grayness VANISH. This vision just
ended. When we pop back out of it, we're TIGHT on Mackelway...
CUT TO:

21
Fran and Mackelway emerge, heading for the Bonneville.
MACKELWAY
We ought to work out some kind of
protocol.
FRAN
For what?
MACKELWAY
Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty
silly, our talking over one another.
FRAN
Fine. I'll handle them from now on.
He doesn't argue. They come to a stop at that Bonneville,
stripped down to its primer. Time to work...
Two agents, all instinct. We see them study things, details,
their minds always churning... Mackelway pulls out his Minox,
snaps off a few more shots. Then:
MACKELWAY
Trunk's ajar.
She turns. Sure enough, the Bonneville's trunk is ajar.
Mackelway approaches, cautiously.
He doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to
protect against prints. He opens the trunk.
First thing he sees is that SYMBOL again: a circle-with-a-
slash-through-it... staring right at him.
21.
But this time, it's been carved into somebody's back.
Mackelway stares. So does Fran. Before them lies a body,
stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged MAN. Dead.
Mackelway sighs. Things just got tougher...
CUT TO:
22
24
A three-story Victorian residence in decay, next door to a
CHURCH/SOUP KITCHEN in the middle of Oklahoma City's Skid Row.
Rain falls. The street is still.
Mackelway approaches this halfway-house. A few lights shine
within, and the blue glow of a tv. Upstairs can be heard the
strident, off-key voice of somebody singing.
25
25
The front door is open. Through a SCREEN DOOR, Mackelway can
see an old-fashioned "foyer." He knocks. Waits.
Two sounds dominate: the buzz from that tv, and the strident
singing, which we realize is an a capela version of "La Vida
Loca" audible through an open bedroom window.
But no one's coming to answer the door, and it's wide open
anyway... So Mackelway enters.
MACKELWAY
Hello?
26
We're RUNNING, dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe,
hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the
thuds of our own heavy feet.
This is Matamoros, Mexico, a shit-hole of a border town.
Squalor and sin. We find a DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN. He nods: "This
is the place," and sticks out his palm.
27.
30
42
A typical honky-tonk in a town called Sleeper, Missouri. Just
across the street from O'Ryan's cheap motel...
32.
43
45
Loretta walks to her VW Bug. Starkey exits the bar. She
doesn't notice. We TILT UP: the lights are off in O'Ryan's
motel room...
46
46
It all happens pretty fast: That chip-clip hits the ground
beside the open VW door. A battered PICK-UP speeds away,
kicking up gravel.
CUT TO:
...Loretta's eyes, wide with terror and dread.
47
50
Starkey lies, face up. Shocked. Squirming. Bleeding. Standing
over him, looming large as a Grizzly... is O'Ryan. A long
HUNTING KNIFE extends from his hand.
But his tone, to our great surprise, is conversational:
O'RYAN
Hey, listen, I'm sorta new in town. Ya
know where I can find a good donkey show?
Starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac:
STARKEY
Huh?
O'RYAN
Oh. Forgot. Wrong country... In America
animals have rights.
(pointedly)
Don't they, Virgil?
STARKEY
How the fuck should I know?
O'Ryan half-smiles, then kicks Starkey right in the head.
Loretta's eyes go wide. Another kick follows, to the ribs.
Then one to the groin. Then:
35.
O'RYAN
(at Loretta)
Turn around.
He said that without looking at her. But he can tell that she
hasn't moved - too frightened. So he eyes her.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(again)
Turn around!
She turns away, lying face down on the seat, covering her
head. No idea what kind of terror is to come next. We STAY
WITH HER... able only to hear what follows:
The sound is animal, awful - like a pig being gutted - a
horrible SQUEAL, covering the GRUNTS coming from O'Ryan.
In goes the knife again, prompting another agonized cry from
Starkey. Loretta's crying too: from fear, shock... She keeps
her face buried, shutting her eyes tight. The sounds of
savagery fill the night.
Then, one last gasp from Starkey... followed by an awful
silence... and the assault is over.
Loretta's too afraid to look up - certain that the maniac with
the knife will be coming after her next.
But then she hears FOOTSTEPS, trailing away. So she rises,
peeking over the edge of the window. WE STAY ON HER FACE, as
she sees what's become of her attacker.
Her horrified SCREAM fills the woods...
51
52
Law enforcement VEHICLES surround the site. COPS, Grieves,
CORONER'S GUYS taking pictures. Loretta is sitting on the back
of an ambulance, being tended to.
A COMPOSITE ARTIST sits beside her, trying.
LORETTA
I don't think the eyes are right.
36.
COMPOSITE ARTIST
Narrower?
LORETTA
No, they were... I don't really know.
Composite Artist keeps trying, but his attempt doesn't look
anything like the face of O'Ryan.
Charlton, meanwhile, stands over the body, mind racing.
A Missouri Highway Patrol car pulls up. Mackelway steps out of
it. We follow him as he takes in the scene.
A FLASHBULB illuminates Starkey's CHEST; is got a zero-with-
a-slash-through-it. But Mackelway hasn't seen the guy's face
yet.
MACKELWAY
Sir?
(Charlton turns)
We got an i.d. yet?
CHARLTON
Mmm-hmm.
(Mackelway waits)
Might wanna find yourself a fender.
You're gonna need to sit down.
(Mackelway's still waiting)
It's Virgil Ray Starkey.
Mackelway pales.
We stay on him for a moment as it registers. The man he
caught, and then lost, has killed again. No. God, no.
MACKELWAY
(struggling for composure:)
Starkey did this?
CHARLTON
No. Starkey's the one on the ground.
Mackelway pauses, thinks he must've heard wrong. But he turns
toward the face, as ANOTHER FLASHBULB illuminates it, searing
the image into the darkness. Starkey. Dead. His eyelids ripped
away.
Mackelway stares, stunned. Can't fucking believe it.
MACKELWAY
(breathless)
My God...
37.
It's like looking at a ghost - a spectre that's been haunting
him, dead now... Mackelway pulls out his Minox, starts
photographing, moving in on those LIDLESS EYES...
GRIEVES
Gonna make a wallet-size of that one?
CHARLTON
Give him a break, Grieves.
Mackelway doesn't comment. Just keeps snapping shots...
CUT TO:

A beautiful campus, quiet tonight. In its center lies a vast,
expensive structure - the Behavioral Sciences Building. The
place goes on forever.
57
70
That TRUCK has just thundered by, leaving a swirl of debris in
its wake. We TILT UP from it... to find that those STORMCLOUDS
once in the distance are upon us now.
And they are pulsing with menace. Rain, wind, lightning,
thunder. Like a black wave, about to descend...
71
72
A high school MARCHING BAND is out here, practicing.
Cheerleaders work on their routines nearby.
Then a LOUD WHISTLE SOUNDS. It's the BAND-LEADER, who is
taking note of the weather gathering overhead. The music from
the band ceases.
BAND-LEADER
Everybody into the gym!
The band-members start to move. LIGHTNING erupts overhead.
73
73
An unnamed MOTHER emerges onto her back-porch, where her FIVE-
YEAR OLD DAUGHTER is having a playdate with a FRIEND.
This house borders a wooded area. That wind is starting to
make the trees swirl.
MOTHER
Girls, I want you to come in now.
Startin' to rain.
The girls sigh, disappointed, deciding instead to hide
themselves inside the TENT they've erected out here.
They giggle. The mother doesn't. CONTINUE INTERCUT:
74
75
A SOCCER GAME's been called in the middle of the Second Half.
PARENTS and their uniformed 12 YEAR-OLDS scatter.
RAIN is pouring down now, blown sideways by that wind.
50.
76
78
O'Ryan leans against the door of the church, pelted by that
heavy rain.
BAM! Here comes those IMAGES AGAIN:
79
79
Tall wheat, whipped by wind and rain. A muzzle-flash. The
sound of a body slumping hard to the ground.
...and Mackelway, looking over us. Then:
80
80
We're back with O'Ryan. He leans against the door, his
torment constant.
He walks away from the church, into that heavy rain.
81
83
This is the lone source of light on an otherwise dark stretch
of road. Mackelway's Yukon pulls up.
84
89
We've been to this house before. Suburbia.
Mackelway sits in his car, at the curb, studying the place.
Rain falls in sheets, wind blows. And there he is, all alone,
six in the morning, staring at a house.
That idea - the thought that snapped his eyes open - it's
still working on him. Beside him is the DRAWING that was found
in Speck's car:
The rendering of a steamer-trunk, lined with plastic,
containing body parts in plastic bags... Mackelway seems to be
fixated on it now.
CUT TO:
90
90
A hand knocks on the front door. Jan Speck opens up.
JAN
(hoping for good news:)
Agent Mackelway?
Mackelway stands in the doorway, rain falling behind him.
MACKELWAY
(all business)
Mrs. Speck. Just had a few more
questions.
CUT TO:
91
92
Mackelway sits in his car. Through his windshield we see Jan
as she backs out of the driveway.
She pulls past us, giving Mackelway as friendly a wave as a
grieving widow can give. He waves back.
Then she's gone, disappearing around a corner.
Mackelway pauses a beat, checking his rear-view mirror to be
sure. Then he gets out of his car...
CUT TO:
93
93
Mackelway sneaks around the side of the house, pulling on a
lever to unlatch the side-gate.
94
94
He emerges into the tiny backyard, making a bee-line for that
storm cellar door.
He knows he shouldn't be doing this. It's beyond risky. But
here he is, without a warrant.
There's no lock on the cellar door. He reaches for it. Then he
stops himself. Just noticed something:
A NEIGHBOR-LADY, visible just over Speck's backyard fence, is
looking right at him through her bedroom window.
Fuck it. He enters the storm cellar.
95
96
He emerges from the storm-cellar, confused. Shuts the storm-
cellar door.
Then he turns. Something else just caught his eye:
Above Speck's bedroom window is another window, a tiny one. An
attic...
He heads for that UNLOCKED BACK DOOR, and enters...
97
102a
Close on Mackelway as he returns to his Yukon satisfied. He is
pleased with himself. Out of nowhere, a firm hand grasps his
right shoulder stopping him.
Mackelway turns abruptly, finding himself sandwiched between
his Yukon and Charlton, who is now in his face.
CHARLTON
Listen to me Cowboy. You have any idea
the kind of favors I had to pull with the
Abilene cops to cover your ass?!
MACKELWAY
Sir...
CHARLTON
(not allowing him to talk)
Breaking and ENTERING the Speck house
without a shred of evidence and NO
WARRANT?!
MACKELWAY
(not going down without a
fight)
The sample I took from Speck's bumper...
It's crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with
oil of Clove, the clove neutralizes the
odor of the acid.
Charlton shakes his head, he is not getting through.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
It was SPECK not his killer who was
hiding something.
CHARLTON
Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent
from Dallas gets sent down to the
Wichita Falls Field Office? I'll give
you TWO WORDS... Hell I'll even write it
down for ya.
Charlton leans in to emphasize his point. He pulls out a pad
and pencil from his breast pocket and writes what he says using
Mackelway's chest as support. It's humiliating.
CHARLTON (CONT'D)
"EVIDENTIARY PROCEDURE." Don't talk about
it. Learn it.
62.
Those words just hang there, haunting Mackelway. Charlton
tears off the sheet with those two words and stuffs them into
Mackelway's hand.
CHARLTON (CONT'D)
Turns out you were right about this guy.
You were right about both of them. But
that doesn't change the fact that you
went about your business like a rookie.
Got it?
Charlton turns, the buzz of a street lamp breaks the silence
throwing a circle of light around the Yukon. Mackelway watches
as Charlton puts on his headlights and drives away.
A sudden gust of wind tears that piece of paper out of
Mackelway's hand, he stares at it, as it disappears into
darkness.
103
105
Mackelway exits the office, heading for his Yukon.
Then he stops... because Katie is waiting out here, leaning
against her Toyota Camry.
MACKELWAY
(fondly)
Hey.
KATIE
Somethin', huh? Guy with a wife and kids
keepin' bodies in his attic?
He nods... but what is she doing out here?
MACKELWAY
Yeah.
(a beat)
You okay?
KATIE
Yeah. Just... Wondered if you could do me
a favor.
64.
Mackelway waits... as Katie hands over a manila envelope.
Mackelway opens it.
Inside, a photo of a heartbreakingly-sweet 22 year-old girl
named KAREN SUMPTER, with an attached sheet listing her
vitals: height, weight, age, etc.
Another face. Another disappearance...
KATIE (CONT'D)
Her name's Karen Sumpter. We were
friends.
(almost reluctantly)
She disappeared last year. Nobody knows
where. She was a little wild, but not
like that.
Her sadness is obvious. Mackelway nods.
KATIE (CONT'D)
Anyway, I know you're gonna be in on the
autopsies - of the girls they found over
at Speck's. Figured you might see if one
of 'em was...
Her voice trails off. This is hard.
KATIE (CONT'D)
If it is, I'd like to be the one to
notify her folks. Out families've been
friends for years.
MACKELWAY
(gently)
Sure. Of course.
KATIE
Thanks... 'Night.
Mackelway puts the envelope under his arm. She starts up the
Camry. The sky rumbles. He eyes her.
For some reason, she hasn't pulled away yet...
SMASH CUT TO:
106
107
Wet wind in a blur of gray. The sound of our own heavy
breathing. A voice rising above the wind, pleading:
(O.S.)
Please...
108
109
Tall wheat, wet wind. Then a MUZZLE FLASH, and a body slumping
to the ground. And suddenly we are in:
110
111
A stolen, non-descript CHEVY pulls out of a motel room parking
lot, on to the street.
112
114
The TROOPER approaches, noting the condition of the vehicle.
He stands before O'Ryan's window. O'Ryan's face reveals no
evidence at all of anxiety.
TROOPER
Evening.
O'RYAN
Evening, Officer.
TROOPER
See your license, Sir?
O'RYAN
'Course. Is there a problem?
O'Ryan reaches into his back pocket, produces an I.D. Hands it
over.
Trooper eyes it. According to this i.d., we are now staring at
"James Garvey" from Littleton, Colorado. But the Trooper
doesn't seem too convinced.
TROOPER
See your registration, please?
O'RYAN
Sure.
O'Ryan opens up the glove compartment, starts searching
through it. But it's a stall, that's obvious.
TROOPER
Mind stepping out of the car, please?
O'Ryan pauses. There is no way in hell he's going to let
himself get deterred by a State Trooper. But he gets out.
115
115
Trooper eyes him with caution. O'Ryan holds his hands in front
of his chest, keeping them visible to the guy.
67.
O'RYAN
Officer, I am carrying something that
could be construed as a weapon. I'd like
to hand it over, voluntarily, so you
won't think I'm trying to conceal
anything. Would that be all right?
TROOPER
What kind of weapon, Sir?
O'RYAN
It's a hunting knife, right here on my
hip.
Trooper notes the shape of that large, sheathed KNIFE - the
one O'Ryan butchered Starkey with - visible beneath O'Ryan's
shirt.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
I was on my way to the woods. My gear's
in the trunk.
(Trooper doubts it)
Would you like me to hand it to you? I
don't know what the procedure is for
something like this.
TROOPER
Take the weapon off your hip, place it on
the ground, and kick it toward me.
O'RYAN
Happy to.
O'Ryan takes the knife off his hip. The size of it gets some
attention from the Trooper.
TROOPER
What exactly were you planning on
hunting, Sir?
O'RYAN
A fifty-foot shark.
No reply. O'Ryan drops the menacing knife to the ground and
kicks it toward the Trooper.
Trooper, slowly, kneels down to get it - never taking his eyes
off O'Ryan.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Ya know, I used to be in law enforcement
too.
68.
TROOPER
(kneeling)
That right?
O'RYAN
Mmm-hmmm. FBI. 'Course this was some
years ago.
Trooper grabs the knife, straightens. Examines it.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Psy Ops. Classified.
TROOPER
Had anything to drink tonight, Sir? Under
medication of any kind?
An 18-WHEEL TRUCK rumbles by, distracting O'Ryan... rendering
him immobile for a moment.
TROOPER (CONT'D)
Sir?
O'RYAN
Oh. Sorry. Just found myself wondering
what was inside that truck.
TROOPER
Sir, I'm going to ask you to hand me the
keys to your vehicle, please.
O'RYAN
Of course.
O'Ryan opens the car door. We steal a look INSIDE.
...he's got a GUN under the front seat.
In a flash, that gun is in his hands and pointing right at the
forehead of that Trooper.
Trooper knows he's been had. And he knows that he's about to
die...

117
Mackelway approaches, carrying a greasy bag: another Frito Pie
and a soda. Fumbles with his keys... Then he notices
something, waiting on his doorstep.
69.
It's a thick FILE, roughly 150 pages, in a FOLDER. The word
"MACKELWAY" is written across the front.
He leans down, opens the folder. The light is spotty out
here... but it's just strong enough to show us the expression
on his face: a look of pure awe.
118
134
The sounds of that wave become fainter, receding to the
background, giving way to that sound of laughter, and the
squeaking of a PLAY-SET SWING.
Like an old tv slowly gaining reception, the image takes a
moment to crystallize before us. But then it sharpens:
We're in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER, but it feels
like we're looking at it through a broken lens. The images
appear SPHERICAL to us, surrounded by darkness.
Before us a 5-year old plays on a swing. Call him CHARLIE.
135
137
We WHIP AROUND quickly, getting a look into the diner itself.
There, through a window, we see a WOMAN, presumably Charlie's
mother. Her name's KATHLEEN, 40.
Kathleen has her back turned to us, because she's busy
diapering her nine month-old BABY at a table.
138
139
The sound of that wave is still a presence. Charlie looks up
at us as he swings. His smile is pure, genuine.
We whip around for another look at Kathleen. She's still busy
with that diaper. Then we look back to Charlie.
140
142
That swing is now EMPTY, dangling gently. And we're running
we know not where.
143
144
We run... toward a PARKING LOT. But we do so smoothly, without
effort, as if being carried by that relentless black wave.
Then, ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in. The BANGING of the Diner's back
door, which leads on to that Play Area.
And we hear a horrified yell:
KATHLEEN (O.S.)
Charlie?! Charlie, where are you, Honey?!
(fainter)
Charlie?! Honey, are you out here?!
The sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio, being taken
over by the sounds of that awful WAVE...
145
148
We've stepped out of that SUBJECTIVE POV now. Kathleen grabs
her infant, distraught, as another massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK
blows by us in the distance...
149
162
A copy-place, right off I-30. Mackelway's Yukon is parked in
front.
163
165
A huge lay-out, with a diner, rest-stop, and gas station.
166
169
Mackelway backs out in the Yukon, trying to keep a visual on
Vic's truck.
ANOTHER 18-WHEELER pulls in front of him, blocking his view
entirely.
93.
MACKELWAY
Dammit!
He honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler, heading
for the exit of the lot.
Just spotted Vic's rig again.
170
170
He follows Vic's rig out of the lot and onto a road
approaching I-30. But there are three cars between them -
Mackelway can't get a clean look at Vic's license plate.
Vic approaches the Interstate. So do the three cars between
them.
Vic passes the Interstate on-ramp. The three cars turn on to
it... putting Mackelway right on Vic's tail.
He grabs his cel, dials. This truck has license plates from
ten states.
MACKELWAY (INTO CEL)
This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a
plate. Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor-
Alpha. Got that?
He puts the cel down, but doesn't hang up. Vic just made a
turn onto a VAST DIRT LOT.
A huge BANNER overhead reads, "FOUNDERS DAY CARNIVAL!!!"
171
171
There are several BIG-RIGS parked here, but the vast majority
of the vehicles we see are garden-variety cars and SUV's. A
few pick-ups.
There are RIDES at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel,
and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking. Must
be a thousand people in attendance today.
Vic parks his rig. Mackelway hangs back, watching:
Vic gets out of the rig. From here we can see that that 5-year-
old BOY is still stick in his car seat, and he is still
screaming and flailing.
Vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, "Behave or
else." Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival.
94.
172
172
He gets out of the Yukon, approaching Vic's truck. We CROSS
THE LOT WITH HIM.
He reaches Vic's truck, looks in the passenger window. There's
the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face. (We
still can't tell if it's Charlie.)
Mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door. It's locked. Of
course. And he can't shoot his way in.
He looks to the kid inside:
MACKELWAY
You okay?
(Kid's a blank)
Kid? You okay in there?
The Kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked. Shit...
Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd. Vic's still
visible to us, but he won't be for long.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
(at the Kid)
I'll be back. Don't worry.
Mackelway heads into the carnival.
173
173
He begins running now, past the table where ladies are selling
TICKETS for the rides and games, past the Cotton-Candy Guy.
Running... because we just lost sight of Vic.
Mackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques, upsetting a
tray or two. Then he stops. There's the ferris wheel. Was that
Vic on the other side of it?
Mackelway takes off.
174
174
No Vic. But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy... heading back
in the direction of the parking lot.
He runs past the Pony rides, past a funhouse, past a popcorn
machine, past those ladies selling tickets.
95.
175
175
He hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance. But he bursts
through, runs into the dirt parking lot, around cars and big-
rigs, then turns a corner and:
...runs smack into Benjamin O'Ryan.
The shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to
recover from it. But here he is. O'Ryan, five feet away.
Mackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself. A
second ago he was chasing a possible Zero. Now he's face to
face with O'Ryan.
And O'Ryan isn't running. In fact, he almost seems amused.
O'RYAN
Well, well... Must be quite a moment for
you. Congratulations.
Mackelway still hasn't spoken, until:
MACKELWAY
What're you doing here?
O'RYAN
Waiting for you.
...which is when Mackelway realizes that he is standing right
in front of Vic's rig.
But he wasn't expecting what comes next:
Vic has returned to the rig, with a WOMAN beside him. Turns
out, she's his WIFE. Vic opens the passenger-side door,
unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat.
FIVE YEAR-OLD
Mommy!
The kid dives into the Woman's arms.
WOMAN
Morning, Baby!
VIC
I told you she'd be here.
(to Woman)
He's been a brat all morning.
96.
Mother hugs son... which means that Mackelway has misread
things, badly.
And O'Ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin.
MACKELWAY
(at O'Ryan)
Hands up.
O'Ryan raises his hands. Mackelway reaches for his cuffs.
CUT TO:
176
176
O'Ryan's hands are cuffed in front of him. Mackelway leads him
to the Yukon, opens a door for him, and puts him into the
backseat. A few LOOKIE-LOU'S strain for a peek.
177
180a
Out of a soupy darkness, a dreamlike spin on a location we've
visited before: It is the wheat field that O'Ryan has Remote
Viewed countless times. Only this time we see it through
Mackelway's fever, or nightmare... We see the tall wheat, the
wet wind - familiar images to us. All to the pounding Chant of
the Navaho.
But then OTHER IMAGES enter this world. They're jarring:
-That TRIBESMAN, eyes rolling back, foaming the mouth,
dancing around a fire in a frenzy. Then a curtain of wheat
obscures him, revealing:
-Fran, and Katie, giggling, crooking fingers as if inviting
us. Looks like they're naked. But as we approach them, they
seem to get farther away. Then that curtain of wheat that
separates us from them reveals:
-Charlton, extending a hand to us, warmly, congratulating us
for something, a job well done, when:
Mackelway himself is hunting through the wet wheat, gun drawn.
He FIRES... Then looks to see who he's just shot.
A body. He turns it over.
...and is staring at himself, lying dead on the ground in the
mud and pouring rain. It is a moment of shock and horror,
giving way as we...
181
FADE UP AGAIN...
181
...on O'Ryan - at a desk, sitting upright, making notes on a
pad. Calm. Businesslike. His back turned to us.
182
184
Out of a gray, soupy swirl - coming slightly into focus: Wet
wind, tall wheat, our own heavy BREATHING as we run... And
that non-descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the
sound of O'Ryan's voice, static-filled, wobbling:
O'RYAN (O.S.)
Please... I'm begging you.
That was clear enough. A gun rises. We seem to be holding
it...
Then those images vanish, and we are jolted back to:
185
188
We've seen this place before. That is, we've seen it in
O'Ryan's DRAWING, which lies on the dashboard before us: A
ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard.
O'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds on the roof and hood. Wind
blows. Mackelway studies the house. Then his eyes shift
briefly to the drawing.
MACKELWAY
Can't bring you in with me. You know
that.
O'Ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: "Cuff me."
The CUFFS are lying on the floor in the back seat. Mackelway
reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for O'Ryan
to club the guy.
But O'Ryan remains still. Mackelway grabs them. Then he stops.
Simply has to ask:
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me's...
How many of 'em is he actually
responsible for?
O'Ryan lays it right out:
O'RYAN
All of 'em.
Mackelway nods, sobered. Cuffs O'Ryan to the steering wheel
and approaches the house.
110.
189
189
The place is in some disrepair: untended lawn, chipping paint,
etc. Mackelway looks through the kitchen window.
No one's visible. He walks around the side of the house.
190
191
Mackelway moves cautiously, being pelted by rain. But now he
can see inside the Living Room of this home:
It's a bit of a time warp: plastic on the furniture, an old
radiator, pictures on the mantle in antique frames.
And an OLD LADY, leaning over a record player.
Tough to hear what's playing - we're outside, and that storm
is pounding - but it sounds like Glenn Miller. There's also an
old tv in here: "Wizard of Oz" is on it.
The lady is 70, frail, thin. She also happens to be BLIND.
Cataracts on her eyes. Her name's DELIA. Mackelway watches
her... as she exits the room, heading for the kitchen.
He moves to another window.
192
193
Mackelway watches as Delia makes her way into the kitchen.
It, too, is from another era: the dishwasher stands in the
center of the floor, connected to the sink with a long hose.
The refrigerator, the table, the toaster - all old.
The oven is an antique too. Delia crosses to it, grabs a
towel, opens it... and pulls a CAKE from it.
111.
She brings the cake to the kitchen table, moving well for a
lady who can't see. On the table is an old-fashioned baker's
frosting tube.
She grabs it, using her hands to orient herself... and begins
to write on the cake, in frosting. Slowly.
Mackelway can't see the top of that cake, but we can. The
first letters, in beautiful cursive, read: "Happy Bir..." It's
a work in progress.
194
195
Delia stands in the open doorway: an old blind lady, talking
to the dark rainy street. That confuses them.
...until we hear the rumble of an 18-WHEEL TRUCK.
It turns a corner onto this street. Mackelway turns now...
We've seen this truck before. A monstrous, rolling beast. And
Mackelway straightens, reaching for his sidearm. Behind him,
Delia smiles excitedly, almost dancing.
But that smile soon leaps from her face... as she hears the
sound of that 18-wheeler, BRAKING ABRUPTLY, its tires locking-
up on the wet road.
112.
Mackelway gets a look at the DRIVER now - a wiry, sinewy man
of 35... Let's call him ZERO.
Their eyes lock - until Zero throws his rig into gear again
and begins to rumble down the street.
DELIA (CONT'D)
(confused)
Daryl? Honey?
No answer. That truck is rumbling away. Mackelway turns,
racing for the Yukon, leaving Delia at the door.
196
197
O'Ryan drives, pursuing the big-rig. Mackelway gets on his cel-
phone, dials. Rain falls in SHEETS all around them.
MACKELWAY (INTO CEL-PHONE)
(urgently)
This is Mackelway! I'm travelling north
on... Grove Road, approaching I-30 in
Greenville. Request immediate back-up.
Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated
truck, Texas license plate Alpha--
The Yukon swerves hard to the right, narrowly avoiding the
tail end of Zero's rig as he swings it into our path.
Mackelway drops the phone. Grabs it again.
MACKELWAY (PHONE, CONT'D)
Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha.
Zero does it again - swinging the rear of his rig across the
road, forcing O'Ryan to swerve hard. The Yukon gets shoved on
to a curb, then clunks down to the street again.
113.
Then Zero jams on the brakes. Mackelway's eyes go wide.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
(at O'Ryan)
Brakes!
O'Ryan jumps on the brakes. The Yukon screeches to a stop,
throwing itself into a sideways slide. It bangs, passenger
side first, into the rear of the truck, breaking a window.
Mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass. Then the rig
pulls away again. O'Ryan follows.
198
THE CHASE - CONTINUING
198
Zero's rig turns hard onto a SERVICE ROAD, running parallel to
the Interstate. Mackelway is locked in on that truck.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
(into cel-phone again)
Travelling due west now. Don't see a
name. It's a service road, running
parallel to the--
Then Mackelway freezes, mid-word. He just saw something that
made his jaw drop:
On the other side of this road is a field of TALL WHEAT.
Time seems to stop. His blood feels like it just congealed.
Tall wheat in a wet wind. He has been here before. He has seen
it before.
And so has O'Ryan...
Mackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips past
them. The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he
forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid...
Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way. He knows
that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, with
O'Ryan.
And O'Ryan will be begging him for mercy. "Please..."
O'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the rig.
Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time.
That shreds their front tire.
...which means that in one minute this car is going to be
undriveable. So if they don't stop Zero from hitting that
Interstate - now - Zero will be gone.
114.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
(absently)
What're you...
O'RYAN
Can't let him hit the Interstate.
Mackelway braces himself, as O'Ryan guns his car up the left
side of the rig, shredded tire and all. Then:
He pulls right in front of the rig. At about 60 m.p.h. And he
jams on the brakes.
Zero swerves, out of instinct. It throws the rig into a
vicious JACK-KNIFE. The van whips around in front of the cab,
swatting the Yukon away like a fly.
We're inside the Yukon as it rolls, Mackelway and O'Ryan look
like tinker toys.
The torque pulls Zero's rig onto its side, sliding hard. Metal
hits concrete, sending up a shower of SPARKS.
The Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road,
upside down. Mackelway, alive and awake, strains to look out
the busted windshield.
What he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zero's rig
is lying flat on its side.
And, of course, he is mere yards from that wheat field...
199
199
The rig's cab lies driver's-side down. But the passenger-side
door pops open. And Zero pokes through it, his eyes
immediately scanning that TALL WHEAT. Rain pours.
Mackelway's watching. O'Ryan, who blacked out for a second now
opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry.
Zero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises. Only thing in his
hand is a TIRE IRON. Carrying it, he sprints into the wheat
field - vanishing.
Mackelway bursts out of the Yukon, in pursuit. O'Ryan's door
is stuck. Mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels
across the street.
Just then - a STATE RANGER CAR arrives.
115.
MACKELWAY
(over his shoulder, running)
Get the van open! He's got a kid in the
van!
STATE RANGER hurries out of his squad car. Mackelway sprints
into the tall wheat.
O'Ryan, with a grunt, gets his door open. Now he too
disappears into that Wheat Field.
200
200
Tall wheat in a stiff wet wind, and not a drop of moonlight to
guide us. Mackelway plunges in, gun drawn. No idea where he's
going.
...except he's been here before. He's seen it. And there is a
feeling of inevitability to all this; it's haunting.
He's practically blind in here. Can't see five feet in front
of him. Nothing but the sound of his own breathing.
That, too, was presaged. Those visions...
201
201
It's locked. Ranger pulls out his handgun and blows the lock
away.
202
202
Mackelway keeps running, deaf and blind.
O'Ryan is running nearby, but they can't see or hear one
another.
203
204
Mackelway keeps going, running blind.
116.
Then, another sound, up ahead. Sounds like the noise of
someone stumbling. Mackelway stops. Listens.
Silence. The sound does not repeat itself.
He continues along, step by cautious step now.
205
206
Mackelway, inching along, heart pounding. He hears a noise to
his left. Whips around, gun poised.
But it's nothing. He sighs. The wheat almost sounds like it's
laughing at him.
Then that TIRE IRON lashes out, from the right.
It catches Mackelway with horrific force, shattering his wrist
and sending that gun flying into the wheat.
Before Mackelway can react, Zero is upon him...
207
207
Fran's Ford skids to a stop outside the van.
...just as the Ranger brings Charlie out of the rig. The kid
is shaking, traumatized. He begins to cry...
Fran gets the idea. She hurries over.
208
208
Mackelway and Zero wrestle, surrounded and obscured by all of
that wheat... Zero is a monster, and he's got that tire iron.
Mackelway has a busted wrist. Hardly a fair fight.
But Mackelway is battling: kicking, clawing, getting in as
many shots as he can. His shirt rips away from his body,
exposing that brand-mark. They roll back and forth. Until:
117.
O'RYAN (O.S.)
(calmly, firmly)
Up.
Zero freezes. Mackelway too. They turn to find:
O'Ryan... who stands here, Mackelway's gun in hand.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Up.
Mackelway's relief is total. He pushes Zero away, rising. Zero
pulls himself off the ground, chagrinned.
ZERO
(re: Mackelway)
Glad you're here, Man. Guy was about to
kill me.
O'Ryan, without ceremony, puts a bullet through Zero's left
palm. That got Mackelway's attention.
Zero howls with pain, his palm gushing. The TIRE-IRON falls to
the ground. Mackelway approaches O'Ryan.
MACKELWAY
I'll take it from here.
He extends his good hand to O'Ryan: "The gun." O'Ryan pauses.
Then...
O'RYAN
Are you going to shoot him?
MACKELWAY
Give me the gun, O'Ryan.
ZERO
Hey, I just surrendered.
O'RYAN
Shut up.
ZERO
I surrendered! That's it!
O'RYAN
SHUT UP!!!
O'Ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at Zero's face.
That shuts the guy up in a hurry.
118.
From that service road now, we hear a line of SIRENS,
approaching from a distance. Unit after unit.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(quietly now)
Look at him, Mack. He's not human
anymore. Go dig up that old lady's
backyard - you'll find bodies there...
Maybe hundreds of them. Of course, ya
gotta get a warrant first, chain of
custody's gotta be followed. One breach,
and he walks.
(no reply)
My way, he's eliminated; the world is rid
of him. It's a lot closer to justice than
having some Prosecutor tell you you've
left a tissue sample in the wrong lab.
Isn't it?
MACKELWAY
(that stung)
Give me the fucking gun!
O'Ryan turns, studies him.
...and hands him the gun. Just like that.
Mackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses
back to Zero, and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground.
O'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as:
O'RYAN
(at Mackelway)
You have to understand: none of this was
arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I.
WHAP! O'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage.
We hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. He
drops to his knees, gasping.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
I saw us here. You did too.
THUMP! Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the
other side of Zero's torso. Now both sides of his rib-cage
have shattered. Breathing is almost impossible.
Mackelway tightens. His head just began to throb...
MACKELWAY
Okay. You made your point.
119.
O'RYAN
Bullshit! If I'd made my fucking point
you would've shot him yourself by now!
Another swing of that tire-iron, across the back of Zero's
neck. He crumbles, face down.
Fuck it. Mackelway crosses to O'Ryan and puts that gun right
up against the back of O'Ryan's head.
MACKELWAY
Enough!
Then, an odd thing... O'Ryan simply smiles.
Something about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a
relief.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
Drop it.
O'RYAN
Or what?
MACKELWAY
Just drop it.
O'RYAN
Would you shoot me?
That's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider.
MACKELWAY
Put it down.
O'RYAN
(calmly)
I want you to think for a second. About
your destiny. Who you are. You're cursed,
like I am - except you keep running from
it.
(Mackelway's silent)
You hear things. You see things. That's
why you can't sleep, why your head always
aches.
He turns. They are face to face. Nothing but that gun between
them.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
...and it's why you are going to let me
kill this animal. And then you're going
to kill me.
120.
That threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes the moment -
wheeling around...
He takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack. The tire-
iron impacts Zero's skull with a dull THUD, cracking it. He is
dead.
Mackelway's eyes go wide. Whole thing has been a blur.
O'Ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a
man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway.
Mackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in
skull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees.
But O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready.
MACKELWAY
Get up.
O'RYAN
I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this
already. For months now.
MACKELWAY
Get up.
O'RYAN
Every time, we're in this field: same
wind, same rain. And you...
He puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. Then he
pretends to pull the trigger. Mackelway gets the idea.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
It's okay. I want you to. I'm begging you
to.
Mackelway doesn't know what to do. Then, making matters worse:
FRAN (O.S.)
(aloud)
Mack?
She's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon
enough. That puts some heat under O'Ryan:
O'RYAN
I'm tired, Mack.
FRAN (O.S.)
Can you hear me?
121.
She's 90 yards out now...
O'RYAN
Pull the trigger...
(no reply)
I'm not going to jail. Now pull the
fucking trigger!
Mackelway's frozen. O'Ryan knows it.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Fucking coward.
O'Ryan rises now, facing Mackelway.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Some things are not up to us to decide.
They just exist. They're inevitable. This
field. This rain. This moment. It has all
already happened. You know that. You've
seen it too.
He shoves Mackelway in the chest.
FRAN (O.S.)
Mack?
She's 70 yards out now...
O'RYAN
Shut it off for me.
MACKELWAY
I'm not going to kill you, O'Ryan.
O'RYAN
Of course you will. I've seen it.
MACKELWAY
You saw wrong!
O'RYAN
(incredulous)
That's impossible.
FRAN (O.S.)
Mack? Can you hear me?
50 yards out now. Maybe close enough to hear O'Ryan's voice...
O'RYAN
(rambling, unraveling)
You don't understand. Those fucking faces
(MORE)
122.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
on that map. They call to me. I see their
eyes in the dark - they're staring at me:
"How did you let this happen to me?" But
that's the thing about them - they're
like pictures. They never blink. They
just...stare, and always at me. That's my
destiny, do you see? I didn't help them
when they needed me and this is my
penance. Fine. I ACCEPT IT. But I'm
opting out now, ya get it? I can't stand
this anymore! I wanna close my eyes for
once and see something other than
torture.
(Mackelway's expressionless)
It's not a bad start, Mack. We've made
the world a little safer now. Speck,
Fulcher, Starkey, now Zero. We've made
justice. But I get some too. You have to
end all this for me. That's why you're
here. It's your destiny.
MACKELWAY
Stop telling me about my fucking destiny!
O'RYAN
(again)
But I've seen it!
MACKELWAY
Open your eyes, O'Ryan! Here I am,
standing here. I'm not shooting you.
Doesn't that fucking tell you something?
You're a guy with a skill. Period. They
taught you more than they should've. I'm
sorry about that... But you're not God.
You can't see everything.
O'RYAN
Yes I can! And you can too! That's why I
chose you!
FRAN (O.S.)
Mack?
Mackelway's not budging. O'Ryan can see that.
O'RYAN
(re: tire-iron)
Fine. I'll make it easy for you:
O'Ryan picks up that tire-iron. Mackelway sees what's coming.
O'Ryan swings the tire-iron as Mackelway backs out of its
range.
123.
MACKELWAY
Put the fucking thing down, O'Ryan.
O'Ryan keeps pursuing. Another swing. Mackelway keeps backing
up. The swing misses.
O'RYAN
Look. It's perfect. Won't even need a
hearing this way. You apprehended the
suspect in the commission of a murder.
Then he turned on you and you fired in
self-defense.
O'Ryan isn't letting up. And Mackelway can't quite fire.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
These things are bigger than you -
haven't you seen that yet? Destiny.
Justice. Mercy. They're vast. We're just
puppets!
MACKELWAY
I'm not going to kill you!
O'RYAN
You don't get to decide that!
MACKELWAY
Yes I do!
O'Ryan takes one more swing, as:
FRAN (O.S.)
FREEZE!!!
Silence. Mackelway turns. So does O'Ryan.
There's Fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right
on O'Ryan. His shock is total.
FRAN (CONT'D)
Drop it.
O'Ryan doesn't move at first. Then, slowly, an ironic smile
snakes its way across his lips.
O'RYAN
(at Mackelway, surprised)
It's funny. I never saw anyone else out
here. Did you?
Mackelway doesn't answer. He can't. O'Ryan eyes him.
124.
O'RYAN (CONT'D)
Do it, Mack. Please.
(Mackelway's silent)
Please. I'm begging you.
There it was: the very thing Mackelway's been hearing all this
time, the exact words. Unsettling as hell.
...and we begin to INTERCUT: images of this moment with images
from those "VISIONS" that have been hinting at this very
wheatfield since Page One...
208a
Tall wheat, wet wind, O'Ryan's voice: "I'm begging you..."
...Mackelway snaps himself out of the vision.
MACKELWAY
I can't.
That was almost an attempt to make those images stop, to deny
its awful, inevitable conclusion.
MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
I'm not you.
O'RYAN
Yet.
Two men, neither of them flinching... until O'Ryan nods - as
if to say "Good-bye."
...more of that vision interrupts now: a gun, rising...
O'Ryan rears back and swings that tire-iron right at
Mackelway's head.
Fran has no choice. She fires.
O'Ryan is hit right between the shoulder blades. The tire-iron
hits Mackelway in the shoulder. O'Ryan crumbles to the ground,
landing face up.
...a body slumping to the ground. O'Ryan... Mackelway stands
over him...
Now, real-life again, Mackelway stands over O'Ryan, just as
O'Ryan had always envisioned it. That makes him smile, even as
he's dying.

O'RYAN (CONT'D)
(weak)
Thank you.
Then he dies, eyes open. Mackelway looks to Fran...
DISSOLVE TO:

Hours have passed. Dozens of LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES have
arrived. Sherrifs, Feds. Zero's rig remains on its side.
Mackelway sits nearby on a CURB, his shattered wrist is in a
SLING. Up above, the CLOUDS have parted. Morning sun streaks
through. No more rain. Fran sits beside him.
At their feet, in the gutter of this service road, lies a
discarded MILK CARTON, covered with dust. The face under the
"Have You Seen Me?" is unknown to us.
Kathleen is nearby, holding Charlie tight. Cops surround them.
An UNMARKED SEDAN arrives. Charlton hurries out of it, making
a bee-line for Mackelway.
CHARLTON
Nice work.
(Mackelway half-nods)
Where is he?
MACKELWAY
Sir?
CHARLTON
O'Ryan. Where is he?
Mackelway rises, studies Charlton. There's nothing to say.
So he extends a hand to Fran. She takes it, rising to her
feet. They leave Charlton behind...
We PULL AWAY from them, craning up, taking in this expanse of
tall wheat, TILTING UP to that morning sun.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
...an AFTERNOON SUN now - blazing white hot. TILT DOWN...

We're some distance away. HEAT RISES off parched Earth,
lending a vaporous screen to everything. But we can make out
the shapes of men in HAZ-MAT SUITS.
Delia's backyard is being torn up by a BACK-HOE. Looks like a
war-zone: BODIES, wrapped in cloth, being exhumed from the
ground. Dozens of them...
But there's plenty of soil yet to be turned... Might be
HUNDREDS unearthed by the time these guys are through. We...
FADE OUT...
