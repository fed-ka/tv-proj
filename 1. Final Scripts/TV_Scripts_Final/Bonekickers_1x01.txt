      DARKNESS - DAY X11

      Floating plain-song -  Beatusservusin Christi dominus... 

                                                                        SMASH CUT:

      EXT. RUTTED COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT X22

      Lightning strikesrevealing the BBCONE LOGO and then FIVE 
      CLOAKED MEN trudging the unforgiving road. Heads bowed. Two 
      riding the same thin horse - a mark of austerity. Remaining 
      three carrying a heavy structure hidden beneath muddy sheets.

      SUBTITLE: Larkhall, Somerset - October 1307

 Between the hospice and the childrens playground.

      Shadows in the trees - the party is being watched. They lower 
      their heavy icon to the ground.

      Thunder explodes and as if this is their cue, out of the 
      trees come the ambushing SARACEN WARRIORS. Their faces are 
      hidden behind black scarves - eyes that are dark and 
      fathomless.

    The CLOAKED MEN shout in subtitled Medieval French -  We re 
      under attack!  /  How can this be? Saracens!   Impossible!  / 
       It s an ambush! 

      These bowed men suddenly throw off their cloaks revealing 
      white robes emblazoned with red crosses and chain-mail that 
      flashes like dappled water.

      TEMPLARKNIGHTS!

      Their leader - JAQUES de SAINT-OMAR - strong and righteous.

                                  JAQUES DE SAINT-OMAR
                          (Medieval French / 
                            subtitled)
                    How can this be? The Saracens are 
                    abroad! In the name of Christ and 
                    the Temple of Solomon, defend the 
                    Relic! 

    The SARACENS charge.

      JAQUES de SAINT-OMAR draws his sword. The blade is long and 
      narrow, the pommel simple. (But this sword is highly 
      significant throughout the annals of History.)

    The Templarcommander holds it aloft - a simple weapon but it 
      immediately inspires his KNIGHTS.

                    Crush the heathen! For the love of 
                    God!*

    The KNIGHTS draw their swords and engage the rushing 
      SARACENS. Lightning flashes plunge us into blazing light then 
      darkness so that the battle is seen in staccato bursts.

    De SAINT-OMAR wades in to battle. The butchery is raw and 
      real and close-quarters. Hacking and panting. Blood splashing 
      into the ground.

    Two of the TEMPLARSare cut down. They fall but don t die, 
    lie squirming in agony in the mud with a dying SARACEN.

      Another SARACEN charges. De SAINT-OMAR engages with him. 
      Sword-metal upon sword-metal. The effort for the SARACEN to 
      swing his blade is immense. De SAINT-OMAR S sword feels so 
      much lighter in his grasp. The Knight cuts the SARACEN down 
      then plunges the blade full into the man. Spurt of blood 
      geysers into the air.

                    Fall back! Protect the Relic!

    The three remaining KNIGHTS protect the covered icon.

    The SARACENS encircle them.

    The KNIGHTS kiss their fingertips and gently touch the hidden 
      cargo - a beam of wood is glimpsed.

                    For the love of God.*

    The SARACENS fall upon them.

    The final slaughter of the remaining KNIGHTS is watched 
      through nearby bushes. The POVof someone unknown whose 
      breath hitches with fear.

      CUT: The bodies of the three fallen KNIGHTS sprawled together 
    on the muddy ground. One of the men twitches and then is 
      still. The rain and mud begin to smother them ...

      INT. UNIVERSITY - LECTURE ROOM - DAY 155

      A cluster of STUDENTS take diligent notes during an 
      astonishingly dry lecture. The round-shouldered LECTURER 
      points to a grid-reference map peppered with dots.

                                  LECTURER
                    If we take our example grid-map, 
                    the Cycladic island of Melos, we 
                    can identify that this grid was 
                    compiled using randomly stratified 
                    sample transects which were then 
                    field-walked such as in the process

      EXT. LARKHALL - OPEN GROUND - DAY 177

      A BUILDING CONTRACTOR refers to a sheet of planned housing 
      with his SUPERVISOR. The development sign is erected behind 
      them. The SUPERVISOR S heart sinks as two archaeologists 
      trudge towards him. All khakis and rain-hoods and North Face 
      gear. 

      PROFESSOR GREGORY PARTON - the slightly florid look of a man 
    for whom middle-age just makes him more interesting. Dirty 
      twinkle in his eye.

      DRBEN ERGHA- Thirties, West African descent but London by 
      birth and manner. A geezer with a PhD.

                                  GREGORY
                          (as they approach the 
                            Supervisor)
                    Oh God, you can see it in his eyes - 
                    job s worth. He ll be on our backs 
                    like a rutting grizzly. Still, on 
                    the up-side, there s a decent pub 
                    opposite. So that s lunch sorted.

    As they reach the SUPERVISOR, a battered mud-flecked Land 
      Rover is drawing up.

                                  SUPERVISOR
                    This is what I found.

    He hands BEN a dull battered coin. BEN whistles his 
      amazement.

                    aren t building on previous layers. 
                    So we haveto take a peek. At the

    The site now consists of a broad evaluation trench.STUDENTS 
      scrape at the soil with trowels. VIV grins eagerly as she 
      climbs over the fencing. Fragments of twisted bone and 
      carbuncled metal are placed in seed trays. It s hard, muddy 
      graft. GILLIAN S hand reaches out and finds a filthy old 
      ghetto-blaster. Queen -  Don t stop me now! I m having such a 
      good time. Having a ball! 

    The STUDENTS chuckle wearily before resuming work.

    VIV tries to get a proper look at GILLIAN - fascinated and 
      nervous. But GILLIAN has her back to her.

                    We have no idea. But the answer 
                    lies under that ground.

      - SARACEN attack. Men writhing and bleeding.

      - JAQUES de SAINT-OMAR rallying his men. 

      - The KNIGHTS surrounded and then slaughtered.

    - A flash of supernatural light silhouetting a cross that

      INT. BEDSIT - DAY 11414

      JAMES springs awake with a cry, his hand finding the knife 
      under his pillow. Young, touseledand clearly broke. The 
      bedsit is grey and lit by a single bulb. It is adorned as a 
      monk s cell. JAMES (trembling) gets immediately to his knees 
    in supplication. Another derelict, COLM, enters. He wears a 
      long dusty trench coat.

                                  COLM
                    James! If you want to get well you 
                    need to keep drinking. I ll do a

                    When we were little boys, Colm .. 
                    What did the Brothers tell us?

      COLM kneels beside him, concerned.

                                  COLM
                    That our founders were betrayed by 
                    those they had protected. That 
                    everyone turned on them.

                                  JAMES 
                    Our founders were betrayed by

                                  JAMES
                    And I ve dreamt about it.

      JAMES is on his feet. He is staring at the photographs on his 
      dusty mantelpiece - pictures of earnest young boys at a 
      monastic school, attended by monks.  

      Outside, a mullah calls to prayer.

                                  COLM
                    I ve just been down the court 
                    house. He s been acquitted.

      COLM switches on the only luxury in the room - a portable tv 
      linked to a digital box. 

    TV - News 24. Courtroom steps. We see a sign saying 
       Birmingham Central Court . EDWARD LAYGASS is a smiling,

    One boot hovers over a seed tray of delicate finds. GILLIAN 
      gestures placatinglyand VIV lowers her leg down slowly. 

    She points to the same patch of innocent turf GILLIAN was 
      staring at earlier.

      A fresh trench has been opened by the team. A small CROWD OF

      named HELENA brings a couple of PATIENTS outside to watch the 
      activity. The PATIENTS are in the last throes of cancer. 
      HELENA is attentive and caring.

      GILLIAN inches into the soil with her trowel. A length of

    in and positioned by the fresh trench. From its roof extends 
      a 15 meter pole with a remote-control HDcamera mounted on

    BEN stands at the back of the Land Rover, leaning over the

    TV - jaunty theme-tune with lots of optimistic synthesized 
      trumpet music. 

    We TRACK OVER the mantelpiece - more photos. A young James 
      singing in the choir and receiving his first communion. James 
    and Colm posing with others in a university fencing team. 
      Snap-shots of a life.

      JAMES sits cross-legged before the TV.

    TV - head and shoulders of EDWARD LAYGASS. LAYGASS strikes 
      just the right pitch - concerned but never somber, warm but

                    In a moment I m going to introduce 
                    you to Lionel. Lionel has served a 
                    sentence at a Category A prison. 
                    When he came to Christ he was 
                    surprised to discover that wearing 
                    a crucifix was considered 
                    provocative. He was staggeredto 
                    discover that his prison chapel was 
                    turned over on a weekly basis for 
                    Indian yoga classes. What has 
                    happened to our Christian identity? 
                    Has it been eroded or have we sold 
                    the Lord down the river to appease

                    I balance an academic commitment

      Empty. We hear singing. Beautiful, crystal-clear singing. 
      It s  Greensleaves . VIV carries the hunk of wood she found *
          absent-mindedlythrough the lab. She sings softly to herself. 
    She travels through the door at the far side into gloom ...

      Dark rows of books and jars containing scrolls and skulls. 
    VIV pauses, song snagged in her throat - a cardboard box 
      catches her eye - CHILD REMAINS, TUDOR, BUS-SHELTER DIG. 

      Sounds of GREGORY joining in with  Greensleaves - gravelly *
    and not so sweet. BEN gives GREGORY a patient, level stare *
    and GREGORY stops singing. Blessed relief.*

      GREGORY has more slides on display. The Crusades - Knights *

                    Our knights have been dated to the 
                    early 1300 s.That s when the 
                    Church turned against them, right?

                    The young lady with the 
                      proceleusmaticbosom is quite 
                    right; the Templarswere deemed too 
                    radical. King Phillip of France 
                    outlawed them in 1307. I believe 
                    the arrests began on Friday 13th. 
                    Hence that date is unlucky.

                    Ah yes, one of the pert little 
                    third years pulled this out. It 
                    definitely belonged to a 
                      Grandmontine.

                                  GILLIAN
                    Well the Grandmontinemonks were

                    Never ceases to amaze me .. all 
                    these centuries of blood-shed in 
                    the name of religion.

                                  VIV
                    Well it s not always like that. 
                          (offher look)
                    Well it isn t. The nastier stuff 
                    always leaves a bigger impact on 
                    history. But that s not how God 
                    works.

                    You were presumably brainwashed by 
                      God-bothering parents ...

                    But holy wars .. Crusades .. It s 
                    the big stuff. I always thought 
                    that God was found in the quiet 
                    corners. In the little things.

                                  BEN

                    someone may have been lacerated 
                    with a metal nail and bled into 
                    this wood.

      GILLIAN slaps down a picture from her collection of 
       Christian baubles  - the True Cross. They stare transfixed 
    at the image of the Cross. Then one by one they turn to look 
    at that mottled hunk of cedar sitting on the table.

                    I m under pressure from the 
                    construction company. They want us 
                    to seal up the find, protect the 
                    site with concrete and let them 
                    build on top. 

                                  GILLIAN
                    You can t do that. There could be 
                    something highly significant still 
                    down there.

                    There s another factor. Another

                    Someone who won t build on it and

      EXT. ALLEY WAY - DAY 24545

      JAMES leans against the dank wall. Runs a sharpening stone 
      along the length of his blade. Presses the cold steel to his 
      forehead. 

      A noise.

      JAMES moves quickly, sword flashing at his side. Along the 
      alleyway. Right turn. Nothing. He waits. Patient.

      HISHAM steps out of the shadows.

                                  HISHAM
                    I ve been learning about you. And 
                    the other orphans.

                    I have a Father.

                                  HISHAM
                    An entire monastic school, founded 
                    with money from Edward Laygass s 
                    family. What did he raise you all 
                    to believe?

                                  JAMES
                    The Truth.

                                  HISHAM 
                    I ve seen Muslims, good Muslims 
                    driven with that look that you have 
                    now. Mad with zeal and longing to 
                    make a difference. There is another 
                    way. If you follow it you ll be 
                    closer to God. Don t make me go to 
                    the Police. Come on mate, stand 
                    down from this.

      JAMES nods to himself, walking forward. HISHAM sees a glimmer 
    of hope. Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  35.

      JAMES swings his sword andHISHAM is decapitated in mid 
      sentence.His body collapses. 

      JAMES is at once aghast and exhilarated by what he has done. 
      Tears pour down his face. He sinks to his knees.

                                  JAMES
                    You have guided my hand and given 
                    me my resolve. I entrust myself to 
                    Your will.

    He leans against the wall and vomits.

    But when he looks back up, his eyes burn with determination 
      beneath his sweaty fringe.

    War drums.

    War drums - urgent. A clarion call.

      A BEGGAR plays the recorder for disinterested shoppers. JAMES 
      approaches him. The BEGGAR throws away his whistle and falls 
      into step with JAMES.

      A BEARDED MAN hands out Christian leaflets. JAMES and the 
      BEGGAR approach. The BEARDED MAN discards his pamphlets to 
    the wind.

      JAMES, COLM and EIGHT FELLOW SOLDIERS walk with purpose, 
      cutting through the crowds. Each wears a white t-shirtunder 
      a flowing trench coat. Swords beneath their coats.

    BIG CLOSE-UP of LAYGASS S TV show. The White Wings Alliance

      LAYGASS reading out a viewers letter.

                                  LAYGASS
                     Dear Edward, I know why we can t 
                    beat Bin Laden. He and his lot have 
                    faith. They may be wrong but at 
                    least they have that. Whereas we 
                    have the True Faith in Jesus but we 
                    don t stand up for it. And that is

                    What if Jesus could be proved? It 
                    would light a fire in all our 
                    hearts. Even in those who had no 
                    faith.  In my Father s house there 
                    are many mansions.  So said Jesus. 
                    Wouldn t those mansions soon be 
                    filled with Christian souls? The 
                    Believers would drive out those who 
                    did not follow the Truth. Just as

    Bay window with a wonderful view of the city. Tapestries on 
    the wall. Spartan urns on the shelf. VIV feels intrigued and 
      privileged. 

    She picks up a Chinese box. Opens the lid and peers in. 
      Reacts with a start and drops it. 

      A photo catches her eye - young Gillian with unruly teenage 
      hair standing beside her mother on a field dig. Mother looks 
      striking and confident. An emotional shadow passes over VIV.

      glasses.

      Then VIV notices the stacks of scribbled notes and sketches 
    on the desk. VIV clicks on the desk lamp, intrigued. Gillian 
    has been drawing swords. Variations on the same idea. And 
      star maps. Pinpointed constellations. VIV can not make sense 
    of it. Writing beneath these constellations -

      blasts on - all diodes blazing.  Bat Out Of Hell  loud. VIV 
      jumps with a yell. Then the surge is over and everything is 
      quiet again.

      A noise outside.

    She steps softly towards the front door. Floorboard creaks 
      outside. Shadow under the door. VIV is stock still. Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  39.


    The wood of the door begins to squeak. The architrave cracks. 

      Silence. She begins to relax.

      A sword blade slides through the gap between door and 
        architrave.Begins to twist and prize the hinges.

    VIV backs into the living room. Sounds of the door 
      splintering, groaning, cracking. What the hell should she do?

      GILLIAN and BEN - truly they can not believe what they are 
      seeing. A CROWD OF PEOPLE standing dutifully behind the 
      cordon in the gloaming, facing the site as though at an 
      altar. Some praying. Many looking sick or wheeling in sick 
      relatives. And men in trench coats (not JAMES or COLM) are 
      handing out white doves. The people take the doves and clasp 
      them tightly. GILLIAN realizes suddenly that the moment is 
      being taped. The camera has a White Wings logo.

      EDWARD LAYGASS moves through the crowd, a concerned hand on 
    the shoulder here, a cupping of a child s face there.

                                  LAYGASS
                    I believe the Knights Templar
                    brought the Cross of Christ to 
                    England. If they were butchered 
                    then maybe the Cross is still here.

                                  LAYGASS
                    Not necessarily. The Knights had 
                    become outcasts. Maybe they were 
                    killed simply for that reason. 

                                  GILLIAN

      INT. ECCLESIASTICAL LIBRARY - NIGHT 37272

      Small but labyrintinewith rows of dusty books. GREGORY lets 
    his fingers skip across the spines, humming something from 
       The Marriage Of Figaro . The stern female LIBRARIAN sssshes
      him. 

                                  GREGORY
                    Apologies madam.

    He locates a heading on  Obscure Monastic Writings. .

                                  GREGORY (CONT'D)
                    Now then, where art thou Brother 
                    Stephen?

      Sounds of the door swinging open. Someone else has entered 
    the candle-lit library.

      GREGORY feels an urge to hurry. He trawls quickly through the 
      spines of books until he finds what he is looking for. Flips 
      down the pages. Finds a heading on the GrandmontineOrder.

      Someone is moving down an aisle of books towards him. GREGORY 
      reads avidly, strolling deeper into the library.

    At her desk, the LIBRARIAN is writing. A shadow passes across 
      her. She looks up but there is no one.

      GREGORY has the book on a reading stand. He photographs the 
      relevant pages with his digital camera.

      A noise in one of the aisles. GREGORY can see nobody. 

      Creak. Floorboard on the opposite side of the case. Someone 
      standing on the other side. GREGORY begins to walk slowly 
      along the aisle. Can he hear footsteps matching him? He 
      freezes. Leans forward and pulls out a book.

      A pair of bloodshot eyes blaze back at him.

      GREGORY drops the book with a crash. He darts down another 
      aisle. He moves fast, switching from row to row. 

      COLMreaches the far end of the library. No sign of his 
      quarry.

      COLM moves out from the rows of books and realizes that 
      GREGORY has given him the slip. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Brother Stephen travelled with our 
                    knights as recounted in his 
                        Chroniculiminori.They were led by 
                    a great Templar; Jaques de Saint-
                    Omar.

    She is fascinated by a picture of Saint-Omar carrying a 
      distinctive narrow sword.

                    Why do you like that sword?

                    If I may resume ... The knights 
                    were attacked. Stephen is vague

                    Saracen coins but Brother Stephen 
                    knew differently.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    English Mercenaries in disguise. 
                    Stephen s careful here. He says 
                    they stole a  most magnificent 
                    relic.  He means of course the 
                    Cross. These thieves were in the 
                    pay of the Grandmontines
                      themselves.

                                  BEN
                    The jammysods! Why?

                                  GILLIAN
                    The Templarswere being wiped out. 
                    The monks couldn t trust them with 
                    the Cross. They made it look as 
                    though Saracens had killed them and 
                    taken the Cross back to the Holy 
                    Land. In fact they would have taken 
                    it to their own monastery in 
                    Cresswell.

                                  GREGORY
                    Cresswell sbeen heavily excavated. 
                    Nothing doing. 

                                  GILLIAN
                    They hid it somewhere!

                                  BEN
                    If the answer was in that book then 
                    Laygass would be lynching heathens 
                    and parading the Cross up Pall Mall 
                    by now. He s missing something.

    out for her. But suddenly she is dragged off the ground.

    She is suspended. The second empty harness is whipped past 
      her.

    VIV is trapped amongst the burning crosses with LAYGASS 
      hunting her.

    FX: A large part of the chamber is now on fire. 

      JAMES descends on the second harness. He draws level with 
      GILLIAN.

                                  LAYGASS
                    Kill her! Do it!

      JAMES swings in his harness, sword in hand. GILLIAN is forced 
    to do the same. He swings by her and slashes with his sword. 
    FX: Now GILLIAN is locked in a deadly game of pendulum with 
      James above a chamber of burning crosses.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    It s never been about faith Colm. 
                    It s been about power. Come on ...

    He holds out his hand - give me the sword.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      INT. DOVE-COTE - UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - DAY 49797

      JAMES swoops past GILLIAN who ducks a second before losing 
    her head. He swings in an arc, ready to get her the next 
      time. She is helpless in his path.

      A sword cuts his harness from above. JAMES falls to the 
      chamber floor, leg broken and helpless.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      COLM pulls back with his sword. Gregory and Ben start to haul 
      Gillian up.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      GILLIAN is being hauled up.

                                  GILLIAN
                    No, I m going down!

      LAYGASS grabs VIV and throws her to the ground, raising his 
      sword. In the hellfire glow of burning crosses he appears 
      demonic. 

    And VIV starts to sing.

                                  VIV
                     And did those feet in ancient 
                    times, walk upon England s 
                    mountains green? And was the holy 
                    Lamb of God, in England s pleasant 
                    pastures seen ..? 

      Beautiful. Pitch-perfect. Pure. LAYGASS is dumbfounded. The 
      song has captured him. He did not expect it. VIV stares at 
    him as she sings  Jerusalem  with utter sincerity. 

                                  LAYGASS
                    God gave you that voice sister. But 
                    the Devil uses it.

    It is the fraction of a beat that is needed.Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  63.


      GILLIAN swings in on her harness and collides with LAYGASS.
    He topples over backwards, splayed across a burning cross in 
      crucifixion pose. FX: He screams as his body ignites.

    VIV sits up. GILLIAN is swinging in for a second pass.

    VIV lifts up her hand - hope beyond hope.

      GILLIAN snatches it.

                                  BEN
                    Now!

    He and GREGORY pull in the harness. FX: GILLIAN rises away 
      from the fire, VIV dangling from her grip.

                                  VIV
                    Don t let go!

                                  GILLIAN

    On the chamber floor, JAMES opens his eyes. JAQUES de SAINT-
      OMAR, the captain of the Templars, stands over him.JAMES 
      lifts out his hand but the Knight does not try to help him. A 
      burning cross falls across JAMES and he is gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. GARWAY - GARDEN - DOVE-COTE - DAY 49898

    The TEAM stagger into fresh air. Black smoke drifts from the 
      cote. Siren sounds from far away. The ELDERLY MAN is running 
      back from his house.

                                  ELDERLY MAN
                    I called the Police! Anyone hurt? 
                    Should I make some tea?

      GILLIAN helps the sagging VIV to get her breath back.

                                  GILLIAN

    big hug.

    The chamber is raging inferno. The crosses are collapsing in 
      ashes. 

      Save one.

    One cross rests in the middle of the conflagration but it 
      does not burn. Then suddenly it ignites in a flame that roars 
      brighter than all the rest. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      PULL BACK from another fire. The flames of a cosy pub hearth.

      DANIEL MASTIFF finds the TEAM sitting around a table near the 
      fire all with pints of real ale.

                    pint of Smug? 

    He turns to leave. GILLIAN goes after him.

                                  GILLIAN
                    Daniel. You were hoodwinked by a 
                    fanatic.

                    anyone can become a fanatic. If I 
                    recall, it runs in yourfamily.

    He leaves her feeling troubled. She returns to the pub table. 
      They watch her. GILLIAN produces the hunk of 2000 year old 
      cedar.

    She tosses the chunk onto the fire. It roars up at once. They 
      watch it burn. They ve done the right thing.
