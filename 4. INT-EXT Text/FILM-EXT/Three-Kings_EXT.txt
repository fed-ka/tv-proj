WIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky.
THE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the
distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT
CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING.
The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders
APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY
BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is
a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby.
Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER
stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares
at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag
over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy
turns around, we see his face for the first time.
TROY
Are we shooting people, or what?
SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
Are we shooting?
TROY
That's what I'm asking you.
SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
What's the answer?
TROY
I don't know the answer. That's
what I'm trying to find out.
PAN TO THREE SOLDIERS 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN --
SOLDIER #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth.
TWO OTHER SOLDIERS put out their hands and get pieces of gum.
PAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands with
his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into his eye.
SOLDIER #3
It looks like a grain of sand, but
I don't know how I'm gonna get it
out--
CAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
If they surrender, don't shoot, if
they don't surrender, then shoot.
PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns
back to the dune and runs a few yards.
Stops and stares, raises his rifle.
He aims at the figure on
the horizon.
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE
The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing,
loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.
Slow motion RIFLE sound.
Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck
explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of
Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up
to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing.
SOLDIER #3 (O.S.)
That guy just shot a towel head.
SOLDIER #4 (O.S.)
Bullshit.
YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER
lies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away. He is
rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other.
He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him.
SMASH CUT TO
The rasping Iraqi dies.
PAN TO CONRAD VIG, 18 or 20, wiry, intense, deep south,
wearing Army issue glasses, out of breath.
VIG
Dag.
Troy turns, upset, murmurs "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys.
TROY
"Gettin' bugged drivin' up and
down the same old strip, gotta
find a new place where the kids
are hip, I get around --"
SOLDIER #1
I didn't think I'd see anyone get
shot over here.
VIG
It looked like the guy's head blew
three feet into the air --
FANTASY SEQUENCE IN SLOW MOTION
The Iraqi's head pops three feet into the air.
BACK TO THE SCENE
SOLDIER #1
Bullshit, that's not what happened.
VIG
I said it looked like that
happened, but then we got here and
he was still breathing.
SOLDIER #2
Oh, my God, it's just like
'Predator,' where the guy, the
black guy --
SOLDIER #3
Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot
off.
VIG
And when it hits the ground, his
hand keeps on firing.
SCENE FROM 'PREDATOR'
Carl Weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing.
BACK TO THE SCENE.
SOLDIER #5
Take my picture.
VIG
Do you still want to sell pictures?
TROY
(distracted monotone)
For twenty.
SOLDIER #5
Twenty dollars, man, what's the
meaning of life?
TROY
You're lucky you got to see
anybody shot in this war.
VIG
War's been over five days, Jim,
ain't gonna be much more of this.
SOLDIER #5
Bobby, take my picture.
He holds the camera out.
SOLDIER #4
If he shot the guy, it's up to him.
SOLDIER #5
It's not like he shot a fucking
deer. It's the enemy.
VIG
Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.
Soldiers get their cash out, Troy takes it.
TROY
Accept no substitute, this is the
real thing, oh, Jesus [winces] --
VIG
What's wrong?
TROY
I got a really bad headache all of
a sudden--
SOLDIER #7 bends next to the corpse and holds his camera out
at arm's length.
VIG
No free pictures, motherfucker.
Vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they roll
down the sand berm.
"I Just Want to Celebrate" by Rare Earth comes on LOUD.
Troy walks away holding his temple in pain; SOLDIERS gather
to stare at the dead Iraqi, getting their cameras out.
dance on a road in the desert. "I Just Want to Celebrate"
BLARES as the CAMERA DOLLIES THROUGH the soldiers.
DOLLY INTO TENT TOWN, past bare chested soldiers pumping free
weights; jogging in formation; sunbathing on big water
storage mattresses; DOLLY OUT OF THE TENT TOWN, past a
soldier taking a makeshift foxhole desert bath, past a dead
Iraqi on the road, a chopper hovering in the distance, to
MORE DANCING SOLDIERS, as music continues --
BILL SMITHSON (O.S.)
Spirits are high and the music is
boisterous as these young troops
celebrate -- Shit. Let me try that
again.
DOLLY AROUND the dancing soldiers to see: hundreds of
stripped Iraqi soldiers lying face down in undershorts.
BILL SMITHSON (O.S.)
Spirits are high and the music is
fucking motherfucking sand in my
eye --
PAN PAST CNN REPORTER BILL SMITHSON, 45, in white safari
jacket over Desert Storm fatigues, cleaning his eye; nearby
a cluster of ROWDY SOLDIERS who are mugging into the camera.
DOLLY TO ARCHIE GATES, 55, Lieutenant Colonel, Special
Forces, wearing sunglasses, talking to HAVICHON, a FRENCH
Special Forces Captain on CRUTCHES with a broken leg.
ARCHIE GATES
Is that what you got from this
experience? A goddamn watch?
HAVICHON
Ees a great fucking watch.
Close up: portrait of a sheik on a Rolex.
ARCHIE GATES
There's 700 million in gold out
there and you're fucking around
with a watch?
HAVICHON
Bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of
gold, man.
ARCHIE GATES
One bunker of gold and we retire
from this horseshit, Hashy--
BILL SMITHSON
Gates.
ARCHIE GATES
Just a second. The problem, Hash,
is how do you find it?
HAVICHON
Like one sowsan bunker out sair --
ARCHIE GATES
Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair,
Hash, how do you find Saddam's
bullion?
BILL SMITHSON
Could I have some help over here,
for Chrissakes?
ARCHIE GATES
My goodness, Bill, what seems to
be the problem?
BILL SMITHSON
I'm trying to do a story here and
the fucking sand is blowing in my
face --
ARCHIE GATES
You want me to stop the sand? I
can't do anything about that.
BILL SMITHSON
No, you're too busy talking about
the fucking gold, which by the way
makes a great story if you'd get
me a goddamn lead on it --
ARCHIE GATES
I think the Saddam story goes more
for the jugular, journalistically
speaking, I mean, he's still here
beating the shit out of his
country.
BILL SMITHSON
Would you just be my guide and not
my fucking producer? You're my
guide.
ARCHIE GATES
OK, go do your celebration story,
Bill.
SMASH TO: Rowdy soldiers mug for Smithson's camera.
SOLDIER #5
We're number one.
SOLDIER #6
Waaaa-hooooo--
BILL SMITHSON
You're heroes.
SOLDIER #6
We're heroes.
SOLDIER #7
Give war a chance.
BILL SMITHSON
You've exorcised the ghosts of
Vietnam with a clear moral
imperative --
SOLDIER #5
Is that what we did?
BILL SMITHSON
Where the hell are you going?
Archie is walking off with CATHY DAITCH a young reporter.
ARCHIE GATES
I'll be right back.
BILL SMITHSON
I don't want you helping other
reporters, goddamn it.
SOLDIER #1
We kicked ass.
SOLDIER #6
We didn't get rid of fucking
Saddam --
SOLDIER #8
Which totally sucks a big dick.
SOLDIER #6
Those people are getting reemed --
SOLDIER #7
Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man.
BILL SMITHSON
Who's getting reemed? The Shiites?
SOLDIER #8
I don't know who they are, man --
SOLDIER #6
We got big firepower but we ain't
saving them --
SOLDIER #5
Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait.
SOLDIER #1
Weehaaaaaaa.
Five soldiers chant Lee Greenwood's anthem, "Proud to Be An
American" into Smithson's camera --

WIDE SHOT -
HUNDREDS OF IRAQIS walking in the desert, hands
raised above their heads.
TRANSLATOR (MEGAPHONE)
Hasnala shi aluno quibaan --
CAPTAIN VAN METER
We will not hurt you. Lay down
your weapons, get on the ground --
TWO IRAQIS with bad face wounds get medical help.
FIVE IRAQIS
on their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as they disrobe.
They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as he holds his M-16
on the begging Iraqis.
TROY
It's cool, no one's gonna hurt
you --
Vig whips out his big Thunder 5 pistol and points it in their
faces.
VIG
Did you rape and torture anybody
in Kuwait, Abdul?
The Iraqis wail for mercy. Troy pushes Vig's pistol away.
TROY
You're making them all hysterical.
Vig points the big pistol at an OLDER IRAQI OFFICER who is
the only one not taking his clothes off.
VIG
Take your fucking rags off, take
this off. No comprende English,
motherfucker?
TROY
What is your fucking problem,
Conrad?
VIG
I'm trying to git him to obey the
spirit of things but he won't take
his rags off.
TROY
(leans down)
Sir? We need you to disrobe like
all the other towel heads, OK?
The Officer does not move, Troy punches his head once. Vig
and Walter forcibly pull the Iraqi Officer's pants off. Troy
takes out a bottle of aspirin, eats two.
VIG
Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy.
Vig points to the Officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled up
piece of paper is sticking out --
TROY
There's a document in that guy's
ass, Conrad.
VIG
That's the freaky thing.
WALTER
Do you think he ate it?
TROY
It wouldn't come out perfect like
that if he ate it.
Troy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket.
TROY
Go get it, Private.
IRAQI OFFICER
Hasa man timal!
The Officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by
Walter as Vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the rolled up,
greasy paper from the Officer's ass -- Troy looks disgusted.
TROY
Open it up.
VIG
You only gave me one glove.
TROY
I'm sorry I don't have another,
but you gotta open it up. That's
how the chain of command works.
Vig takes out a U.S. Army pen and uses it to unroll the
greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand.
CLOSE UP - THE RUMPLED PAPER
is a handwritten map, with scant Arabic writing, a few spare
roads, numbers, and three small boxes.
VIG
What the hell is that?
TROY
Important enough to squeeze your
cheeks for.
Archie is faced by an OLDER TWO STAR GENERAL (GENERAL PYE),
a YOUNGER ONE STAR GENERAL (GENERAL HORN).
GENERAL PYE
This is not the way we service the
media, Major. Stop her --
WHIP PAN TO Cathy runs away as she dresses, MPs grab her.
MP
You are in violation of code 37D,
grinding Major Gates.
They let her go. Soldiers in gas suits laugh.
ARCHIE GATES
You guys have no manners
whatsoever --
Bill Smithson runs up, agitated.
BILL SMITHSON
I told you he was with her --
GENERAL PYE
We're handling this, OK?
The MP pushes Smithson away.
BILL SMITHSON
I wanted help with the gold story,
and he took off on me--
ARCHIE GATES
That's a lot of bullshit.
Smithson is walked away. Archie pulls his pants up.
GENERAL PYE
I give you a prestige job in the
media war of the century and the
guy feels neglected.
ARCHIE GATES
I'm helping him plenty with his
big celebration feature -- Where
did you get this fucking star?
Archie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of General
Horn's collar, with its one star.
GENERAL HORN
They made me a general, pal.
ARCHIE GATES
For what? I don't even know what
we did over here, but Schwartzkopf
gets a book deal, you get a star,
Powell gets to be fucking
president--
GENERAL HORN
Are you high? This is a huge win
for us.
ARCHIE GATES
Running the press pool's a real
big win for me.
GENERAL PYE
You want us to kill more Americans
to occupy Iraq?
ARCHIE GATES
I'm just saying it's ironic,
that's all.
GENERAL HORN
What the fuck is ironic?
ARCHIE GATES
We got the biggest army in the
world here but Iraq still has the
d-bag dictator in power, but
that's how the world works I guess.
GENERAL PYE
Just take care of Smithson and
maybe he'll hook you up to consult
on movies.
GENERAL HORN
It's either that or be a security
guard when you retire.
ARCHIE GATES
Fuck you, Ron.
GENERAL HORN
I'm a general now, you can't say
fuck you to me.
ARCHIE GATES
OK, sir, but there's another thing
I'd like to say, if you don't mind.
GENERAL HORN
Go right ahead, Colonel.
Archie leans wild-eyed into Horn's face and whispers --
ARCHIE GATES
Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn.
SILENT - Troy walks in white shirtsleeves, dark tie, pulling
a cart with a salesman's black case on it over a curb.
Vig fires his pistols with fury at a series of stuffed
animals on logs -- blowing the stuffed animals to
smithereens.
BACK TO
VIG
I don't really have a day job.
TROY
What about the risk of taking a
Humvee and all that --
ARCHIE GATES
We do this shit all the time.
VIG
What else did you do, sir?
ARCHIE GATES
In Panama we went sailing in
Noriega's boats.
TROY
Wow.
ARCHIE GATES
In Vietnam, we got a big gold
Buddha, which we unfortunately
dropped in a swamp by accident.
DOC
What about Iraqi soldiers?
ARCHIE GATES
Let's see. They had the shit
bombed out them for two months,
they're deserting all over the
place, and they've completely
surrendered to us. That's a beaten
army in every sense of the word.
He looks at them.
ARCHIE GATES
You are now under my command,
salute --
They salute him. He straightens Troy's salute.
ARCHIE GATES
What's the guy's name outside?
TROY
Walter.
ARCHIE GATES
Cappy.
Walter comes in.
ARCHIE GATES
You will take Bill Smithson on a
special mission to find the gold
story, but it will be a
meaningless ride that lasts all
morning and takes him nowhere near
Karbala, is that clear?
WALTER
How am I gonna get out of the
company?
ARCHIE GATES
Your captain will be detained by
a friend of mine.
VIG
Is it true you got to take an
enemy ear to be Special Forces?
ARCHIE GATES
No, but if you talk to anybody
about this, I'll kill you.
Vig smile fades as he looks into Archie's cold stare.
Three figures in fatigues crouch low to the ground as they
run to a motorcycle and side car. Walter kickstarts the
motorcycle. PACO the cameraman sits behind Walter with a
video camera. Walter's face is painted beige and brown with
camouflage spots, so is Bill Smithson's, as he crouches in
the sidecar and dramatically gives Walter the thumb's up.
Cathy Daitch stands next to a cameraman filming Van Meter
while another man holds a boom over Van Meter's head.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
How about if I lean on it, like
this?
CATHY DAITCH
Very dashing.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Does it look too posed?
CATHY DAITCH
Would you ever stand like that?
Van Meter tries a couple of poses.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
I think I might, Jesus, this feels
stupid.
CATHY DAITCH
You'll get used to it. First
question: did you dream as a boy
you'd be commanding an infantry
company in a desert war?
CAPTAIN VAN METER
As a boy, I wanted to be either a
veterinarian or a CIA
sharpshooter --
Bach's Gloria, from Mass in B Minor plays as
Pow pow pow, Vig fires his big pistol into the desert.
DOC
Pull.
Troy throws a painted football into the desert. Doc fires the
M-16 and blows the ball to pieces.
Archie drives and moves his hand to the Bach.
The convertible Humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a
mounted 60 mm machine gun, a Bart Simpson doll on the grill.
The Humvee rolls into the vast desert, littered with burned
out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no people.
DOC
Pull.
Troy throws another ball, Doc blows it away.
TROY
Pull.
Doc throws a football from the moving Humvee, Troy fires a
pistol and misses the ball as it bounces to the desert.
TROY
I gave you a better arc, Doc.
DOC
What are you talking about?
TROY
I threw the ball in a higher arc
that was easier for you to hit.
DOC
Bullshit.
VIG
Blacks make better receivers than
quarterbacks.
TROY
Stop speaking right now, Conrad.
DOC
Warren Moon is an excellent
quarterback.
VIG
The Oilers have gone nowhere
behind Warren Moon.
DOC
Randall Cunningham.
TROY
Don't get down in the mud with
him, Doc.
VIG
The Eagles will never get to the
Superbowl with him.
Archie moves his hand to the Bach.
DOC
Doug Williams took the Redskins to
the Superbowl and won, OK?
TROY
We can all agree there are many
excellent black quarterbacks.
Doc throws a ball. Vig fires his giant pistol twice and
misses.
DOC
Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker --
VIG
This gun's too heavy to shoot
one-handed like a movie star --
Vig fires: blam, blam, bam. The Humvee stops abruptly.
ARCHIE GATES
Shut the fuck up.
They sit in embarrassed silence; the joyous Bach choir plays.
No more music. Troy, Doc, and Vig stand spread apart. They
wear white anti-gas suits and hold pistols and drink from
plastic water bottles. A bomb crater is nearby, a wrecked,
burned truck to the side, a SKINNY COW meanders.
ARCHIE GATES
When we pull up to the bunker, the
approach is something called
violence of action, which is
standard in special operations. It
means your movement is so fast and
decisive that the guards are
frozen and we haven't fired a
single shot.
Troy kicks at something in the sand -- and a decayed human
arm springs out, attached to a body with a half-rotted face.
TROY
Shit.
ARCHIE GATES
We dropped a lot of bombs out here
and we buried some guys alive --
VIG
What do you mean?
ARCHIE GATES
Bradleys with big plows cut
through the berms and covered the
trenches --
FANTASY - A HUGE PLOW
on the front of a Bradley pushes sand right TOWARD THE CAMERA
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
They had the option to surrender,
but they chose to die for their
country.
DOLLY INTO five terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the
sand rolls over them.
BACK TO THE SCENE
ARCHIE GATES
Let's rehearse.
They sit in the Humvee and hold their pistols ready.
ARCHIE GATES
We'll say the cow is the primary
guard outside the bunker. We pull
up fast, and stop short.
TROY
Got it.
ARCHIE GATES
And -- Go.
The cow stares as the Humvee pulls up to it fast. Troy and
Doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow --
The cow steps back, and explodes.
Troy and Doc stand splattered with cow entrails. The cow's
head lands with a thud on the hood of the Humvee.
ARCHIE GATES
Who's hurt?
DOC
It's all cow, I think.
VIG
Yeah, it's all cow.
He picks cow entrails off himself.
DOC
They said this was swept for mines.
ARCHIE GATES
Mines are forever, Doc. They never
get all of 'em.
TROY
(low murmur)
'If you could, help me Rhonda,
help help me Rhonda --'
Archie watches Troy.
ARCHIE GATES
Did you guys see any action at all?
VIG
Only night bombing on CNN, except
for Troy's supercool shooting that
guy in the neck--
Archie takes Vig's BIG PISTOL and EMPTIES THE SHELLS and puts
them into his pocket.
ARCHIE GATES
Is sepsis cool?
VIG
What's sepsis?
DOC
Infection of the blood.
ARCHIE GATES
As in septic tank, because that's
what happens when a bullet hits
you. The lead tears in there --
'I Get Around' by The Beach Boys BLASTS as the Humvee speeds
along. A big American flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at
the back of the Hummer.
The Humvee drives fast into the central square of a small
village of low, sand-colored stucco buildings and shanties.
Vig drives as the Humvee speeds around the town square,
zooming past scared Shiites in black robes, a few skinny
dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi soldiers.
VIG
Where's the bunker?
ARCHIE GATES
It should be right --
He studies the map and points to a decayed green building.
ARCHIE GATES
There.
Vig jerks the wheel right.
They drive fast.
ARCHIE GATES
No -- there.
Archie points left. Vig jerks the wheel left, drives straight
toward a low cement building with two Iraqi soldiers in front.
Iraqi soldiers look scared as the Humvee drives up, like it's
going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze.
Vig stands and speaks into a megaphone.
VIG
We are the Army of the United
States of America. We are here to
protect you. Remain calm.
Troy and Doc leap from the Humvee with pistols drawn and
their free hands held up in a 'halt' sign. The TWO IRAQI
GUARDS look stunned as Troy and Doc simply take their machine
guns and put the Iraqis face down on the ground. Troy and Doc
pull out plastic twist hand-cuffs, as used in urban riots.
Archie bounds forward holding up a thick white document.
ARCHIE GATES
Orders from President Bush, step
aside.
Troy finishes handcuffing one of the Iraqi soldiers, as a
gaunt mother, with a baby in her arms, opens her blouse,
revealing her small breasts. Other peasants gather.
IRAQI MOTHER
No milk. Baby milk.
Troy looks shocked until Archie suddenly pushes him past the
Iraqi mother and to the door of the bunker, which Doc holds.
VIG
(into the megaphone)
We are here for your protection
and safety.
Iraqi women and children kiss Vig's feet.
The five Iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands
raised, and the starved Shiite civilians spit and throw
stones at them while 'I Get Around' keeps playing.
VIG
Ya'll be cool now, this is the
U.S. Marines in charge here.
FOUR NEW IRAQI SOLDIERS, armed with rifles, run from the far
side of the square and start shooting.
30 rock-throwing Shiite scatter at the gunfire. TWO MEN fall
to the ground as they are shot.
CHILD
Ma-Maa.
Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone
as he points his big unloaded pistol. The soldiers point
their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of
them look to the side and shout.
ARMED IRAQI SOLDIER
Ganan azwar!
PAN TO a shiny METAL TANKER TRUCK three hundred yards out,
bearing down fast on the village square.
The soldiers open fire on the truck.
INT - THE CAB OF THE TANKER TRUCK
The Shiite riding shotgun fires back, as the windshield
shatters on the truck. The driver is dead. The other Shiite
grabs the wheel.
BACK TO THE SCENE
Archie bursts out the front door, followed by Troy and Doc.
They freeze as --
The tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet away.
An Iraqi soldier fires a grenade-launcher off his shoulder
which explodes the container on the back of the truck --
Milk explodes everywhere, gushing around the wheels of the
Humvee and the feet of Archie and the others.
Shiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush
out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk. Other Shiites
crowd the Humvee and climb in.
Iraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck.
Troy and Doc point their guns in the crowd.
ARCHIE GATES
Move. Out of the way.
Archie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee.
SHIITE WOMAN
Hos-pital.
She holds a SHIRTLESS BOY of 7 with a bandage around his
entire chest. Doc pushes her off the Humvee.
SHIITE MAN
America help.
He grabs Archie. Troy shoves the man off the vehicle. Vig
starts the engine.
ARCHIE GATES
Give them MRE's.
Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army
Meal Rations to the crowd -- Vig leans on the horn.
The friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it
starts to pull away. Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out,
and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites.
Archie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away.
Raging oil fires, 50 feet high -- billowing black smoke.
Walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke. Paco the
Cameraman sits on back. Bill Smithson sits in the sidecar.
BILL SMITHSON
This is boring, I already did this
damn story, goddamn it, where the
hell is the gold?
WALTER
How about rare pelican migration
out by the marshes?
BILL SMITHSON
What?
WALTER
These brave pelicans are migrating
in spite of massive pollution --
BILL SMITHSON
Fuck that. Stop the bike.
Walter keeps driving.
Doc gets out of the stopped Humvee, shaken, and walks around.
DOC
I'm all right, I'm cool.
He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.
Archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset.
ARCHIE GATES
What is the art of war, because it
is not for killing people, it's a
stratagem to give life to many by
killing the evil perpetrated by a
few -- I am burning up in this
goddamn suit --
He angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat-drenched
green T-shirt underneath.
Troy and Vig guzzle water.
ARCHIE GATES
Discriminating use of violence as
a last resort, and even then,
carefully, surgically, that's what
I learned, that's what I'm good
at. But now they underestimate all
this, bomb the same towns for six
weeks
and still leave the scumbag
dictator to starve and butcher his
own people.
The others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits.
TROY
(agitated)
I don't even know what happened
back there. Civilians were
spitting on their own soldiers;
the soldiers were shooting the
civilians and ignoring us --
DOC
They already surrendered to us.
Now they're after Shiites.
VIG
What exactly is a Shiite?
ARCHIE GATES
They make up the ethnic majority
but they don't have any power.
When Bush pulled us out, he told
them to start a civil war to bring
Saddam down, and now they're
getting wasted.
VIG
(totally puzzled)
The civil war? How could it be the
civil war?
FANTASY - STOCK FOOTAGE: UNION SOLDIERS FIGHT DIXIE REBELS
BACK TO THE SCENE
Vig looks puzzled.
TROY
It's a war inside the same
country, Conrad. That's a civil
war.
Archie chucks each of them MARINE UNIFORMS without name tags
which everyone puts on, except Troy.
ARCHIE GATES
Put these on, we are now U.S.
Marines.
TROY
I can't do this, OK? Because I've
got a family and if I shit in a
bag the rest of my life cuz I got
shot after the war's already over
that would be pretty fucking
stupid, wouldn't it?
ARCHIE GATES
What is the most important thing
in life?
TROY
What the fuck are you talking
about?
ARCHIE GATES
What is it?
TROY
Did you hear anything I said.
VIG
Respect is the most important.
ARCHIE GATES
Too dependent on other people.
DOC
Money.
ARCHIE GATES
Comes and goes, man.
TROY
What is this bullshit?
DOC
What's the most important thing?
ARCHIE GATES
Necessity. That's what dictates
what will happen at any given time
in life. Necessity says we don't
spend American lives taking out
Saddam,
which leaves Saddam the
necessity of taking out the
Shiites so he can stay in power,
which leaves us to take the gold.
TROY
We could've been shot.
ARCHIE GATES
Did you notice they didn't touch
us?
We decimated their entire
country. They're scared shitless
of us. [looks at his watch]
There's time to try another
bunker. I say we go.
DOC
Let's do it.
VIG
Rock and roll.
TROY
OK. And I'll be wearing
fashionable kevlar. As a necessity.
He pulls a vest out of the Humvee.
The motorcycle is stopped by the marsh. Siberian pelicans fly
all around. Many lie dead on the ground.
Bill Smithson paces
with a cell phone.
BILL SMITHSON
(on cell phone)
I'm at some goddamn marsh, all
we've seen are Russian cranes.
WALTER
Pelicans.
BILL SMITHSON
(on the cell phone)
I think the Saddam story goes more
for the jugular, journalistically
speaking, Al. Let's grow some
balls and do the Shiite uprising,
for Christ's sake.
Bill Smithson closes the cell phone.
BILL SMITHSON
We're going north to do the
Shiites.
WALTER
I thought the gold was the hot
spot.
BILL SMITHSON
Karbala's the new hotspot, and
I'm driving.
WALTER
Military regulations, you cannot
drive.
Smithson mounts the bike. The cameraman sits on back. Walter
points his pistol at Smithson.
WALTER
Get off the vehicle, sir.
Smithson starts the bike.
WALTER
Don't make me shoot you, sir.
The bike pulls out, leaving him behind. He runs after the
bike and jumps into the side car.
Captain Van Meter strolls, handling an M-16.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
The M-16 is the basic weapon of
the infantry. During Vietnam, it
was fully automatic.
GENERAL HORN (O.S.)
Doug?
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Yes, General.
GENERAL HORN
What the fuck are you doing?
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Well, I'm giving an interview to
CBS.
GENERAL HORN
Do you have authorization?
Van Meter pulls out a folded paper and gives it to the
general, who looks at it.
GENERAL HORN
No.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
No?
GENERAL HORN
Who gave you this?
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Major Gates.
GENERAL HORN
Archie Gates gave you this? Jesus
Christ, Doug, come with me.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
I don't get to do the interview?
GENERAL HORN
No, you don't get to do the
interview.
ARCHIE GATES
Faster.
Bach's 'Gloria' plays loud as Vig drives and Archie stares
straight ahead as the Humvee picks up speed.
The Hummer zips into a bigger village piazza with an old
fortress at one end, and races straight to the entrance to an
underground bunker in the middle of the piazza.
ARCHIE GATES
(into the megaphone)
United States Marine Corps. Put
your weapons down.
Troy and Doc leap out, hold pistols out at arm's length as
they accost TWO IRAQI SOLDIERS pointing rifles at them.
TROY
Drop your weapon.
DOC
Put it down.
Troy and Doc shove the two Iraqis face down in the dirt and
cuff their hands behind their backs.
VIG
Don't make me smoke your ass,
Abdul.
Vig keeps the TWO CUFFED IRAQI GUARDS on the ground at gun
point as 15 SHIITES with crude clubs and sling shots encircle.
One of the Shiites shoots a rock from the slingshot and nails
a handcuffed Iraqi in the back of the head.
VIG
Don't start this shit again.
The Shiites back away as Vig motions with his big pistol.
VIG
I know ya'll Shiite gettin' yer
asses whipped --
Hey, what the
hell is going on here?
PAN TO the ten Shiites, and the naked Man with Glasses, who
is getting dressed, exiting the side of the bunker, ushered
by the unarmed Iraqi Sargeant.
VIG
Git on the fucking ground, Arab.
IRAQI SARGEANT
Prisoner stay. Gabar matan.
VIG
What the fuck are you talking
about?
Suddenly a SHIITE WOMAN runs up to the tortured Shiite Man
with Glasses and embraces him, sobbing. A LITTLE GIRL with
dirty casts on both broken arms runs up and hugs his legs.
The bound Shiite prisoners start to walk away from the
bunker, and the unarmed Sargeant has a fit.
IRAQI SARGEANT
Kinam vanir! Vanir!
He chases the prisoners, pushes them back. The free Shiites
shoot rocks and club him.
VIG
Goddamn it everybody calm down.
The Shiite crowd curses and spits on the Iraqi soldiers. The
Sargeant is beaten.
Suddenly an Iraqi armored truck with a mounted machine gun
races up and SEVEN IRAQI SOLDIERS pour out swinging clubs,
followed by an IRAQI MAJOR, about 45. The Iraqi soldiers
savagely beat the Shiites.
Vig looks horrified as he watches.
TWO SOLDIERS grab the Woman from the Man With Glasses, and
drag her into a circle with three other soldiers; the ten
year-old girl with dirty casts on both arms, screams and
punches at them.
The Man With Glasses is held down at knife point.
VIG
(into the megaphone)
This is the United States Military.
The Iraqi Major glances over at Vig, but the soldiers do not
stop brutalizing the Shiites -- they round up eight more
Shiites and make them lay face down.
Troy runs out the front door.
TROY
Conrad, we need a trailer --
The Iraqi Major stares coldly at Troy. Troy stares at the two
soldiers beating Shiites; five others clustered around the
woman on the ground.
VIG
Did you get it? Troy, did you get
it?
TROY
Yeah, we got it.
VIG
Is it a lot?
TROY
Yeah, it's a lot.
LATER
Troy and Vig untangle, with difficulty, an ox cart from a
messy pile of old ox carts against a bombed out building.
Troy looks troubled --
TROY
(under his breath)
'Little deuce coupe with a fiat
head mill, she'll walk a
Thunderbird like it's standin'
still --'
CLOSE UP A SHIITE MAN is smashed in the face with a club.
CLOSE UP TROY pulls a heavy chain from the Humvee.
TROY
'She'll do a hundred and forty
with the top end floored --'
The Little Girl with arm casts is screaming while her father,
the Man In Glasses, tries to hold her.
Troy and Vig quickly chain the ox cart to the Humvee.
TROY
'She's my little deuce coupe --'
Archie, Doc, and the Interrogator charge out of the bunker
with Vuitton luggage and put it onto the ox cart Troy has
rigged. Archie and Doc stop and stare in shock --
Soldiers 6 & 7 drag and beat Shiites; 5 wounded men and women
lie on the ground bleeding. A cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with
a bleeding head. Five soldiers continue to encircle someone
(the Shiite woman). The Man In Glasses and the Little Girl
PRAY in ARABIC as they bow on the ground.
Troy and Vig stare back at Archie, looking tense.
The Iraqi Major greets the Interrogator warmly and they
embrace. Then the Major salutes Archie.
IRAQI MAJOR
You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?
ARCHIE GATES
We take the Kuwaiti gold. Yes.
IRAQI MAJOR
Saddam cannot keep.
ARCHIE GATES
No, Saddam cannot keep.
IRAQI MAJOR
Saddam have too many problem today.
ARCHIE GATES
He certainly does.
Shiites run past throwing rocks at Iraqi soldiers 6 & 7 who
tackle and pummel them to the ground.
IRAQI MAJOR
You need help to load?
ARCHIE GATES
We can do it ourselves.
The Major turns and shouts --
IRAQI MAJOR
Hazal jarat finan.
Iraqis 6 & 7 jog over. The soldiers are out of breath.
IRAQI MAJOR
These man help you.
INTERROGATOR
You go away fast from this
bullshit.
Archie looks at one soldier's hands.
CLOSE UP: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists.
PAN UP TO THE FACES of the Iraqi soldiers.
ARCHIE GATES
Let's load up and get out of here.
Luggage is loaded into the Humvee and the cart while Troy
directs Iraqis 6 & 7; Doc and Vig help.
TROY
Lay that one flat; OK, sideways --
ARCHIE GATES
This isn't gonna work.
TROY
Sure it is --
The cart collapses from the weight into a pile of broken wood.
The Vuitton bags roll onto the debris-cluttered ground, one
goes through a pool of blood. Doc picks the case up.
IRAQI MAJOR
You need a truck.
ARCHIE GATES
We'll rig two carts.
TROY
Let's take the truck.
ARCHIE GATES
We're not taking their truck.
TROY
Why not?
IRAQI MAJOR
We cooperate with peace accord.
Please take truck.
TROY
Let's take the truck.
Archie looks vaguely disgusted.
Troy backs the truck up.
Vuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck,
which is completely full.
Archie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee. Vig sits next to
him. Archie starts the engine. Iraqi 6 taps on the door of
the Humvee by way of saying goodbye. Archie nods.
The Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman.
IRAQI MAJOR
Nazaran yafit haisul.
Archie watches as Iraqis 6 & 7 walk directly to the circle of
soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been
raped. They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in
an open area and shoot her dead.
Troy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away. Doc stares.
Archie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there
for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman.
The Girl in arm casts screams. She is grabbed by the hair and
pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses
punches him and takes the girl. The soldier chases them with
a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.
Archie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks
slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers.
ARCHIE GATES
This has to stop.
The Iraqis look at him. The soldier with the knife continues
to slash the Man In Glasses.
INTERROGATOR
You get your ass kick in a war, it
feel good to be strong again.
ARCHIE GATES
What did you say?
IRAQI MAJOR
You go now, please.
He salutes Archie.
ARCHIE GATES
I don't think so. I'm sure you
know about the Geneva Convention,
right?
INTERROGATOR
Geneva convention? You bomb my
house, man.
IRAQI MAJOR
That Shiite man is leader of
uprising. He kill my man.
TROY
Archie, let's stick to the plan,
sir. The plan is for gold, right?
DOC
We can help them first, then be on
our way.
TROY
No, we can't. It's not what we're
here for.
ARCHIE GATES
How much?
IRAQI MAJOR
What?
ARCHIE GATES
How much gold do you want to let
these people come with us?
The Iraqi Major smiles. The Interrogator laughs.
INTERROGATOR
Cannot do.
ARCHIE GATES
What do you mean, cannot do? I'm
offering you a lot of money.
The Iraqi Major continues smiling.
IRAQI MAJOR
Cannot let Shiite go --
INTERROGATOR
Saddam kill us.
IRAQI MAJOR
Saddam kill to me if we let them
go, OK? Now you go.
ARCHIE GATES
Cover me.
TROY
Jesus Christ, we can't save
everybody.
ARCHIE GATES
Are you listening? I said cover me.
Troy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the
truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee, and they nervously point
their pistols. Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come
forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also
come forward. To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near
Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight
prone Shiite prisoners laying face down.
Vig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and
mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer.
ARCHIE GATES
No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is
that clear?
VIG
Yes, sir.
ARCHIE GATES
Because we know what bullets do to
vital organs, don't we?
VIG
Make infected pockets filled with
bile, sir.
ARCHIE GATES
That's right, that's what they do.
Troy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward
the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl.
Archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling
the blade away from the man's body. He holds the soldier's
wrist up. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free
hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting
the Iraqi into a choke hold. The soldier drops the knife in
the dirt.
The bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground,
clutching the Little Girl in arm casts.
Troy, Doc, Vig point their guns. The Iraqi Major is pissed.
Archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face
down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. Archie
helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl,
and walks them over to the Humvee.
Two Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick
them back down.
IRAQI MAJOR
(pissed)
U.S.A. is out of Shiite war.
The Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to
the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down.
ARCHIE GATES
No shooting.
Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi
soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.
CUT BACK TO the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his
machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee.
Archie winces, but doesn't let go. The Major does it again,
smashing Archie's hand. Archie winces, doesn't let go. The
Major tries to jerk the barrel up, but Archie pushes it down,
and it fires by accident, into the Major's leg. The Major
howls with pain. Blood dribbles out the bottom of his pants
leg like piss.
Troy covers Iraqi 6 with his rifle.
TROY
What's happening?
ARCHIE GATES
Accident. Stay cool.
Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun from one Iraqi
in the rear to another, but doesn't shoot. Iraqi soldiers
point their rifles at the Americans.
ANGLE ON TROY
TROY
No.
WHIP PAN TO Iraqi 6 jerks his rifle toward Archie and fires.
The sound cuts out.
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: WHIP PAN from Iraqi rifle to Archie.
The only SOUND is the BULLET PIERCING THE FLESH of Archie's
lower left arm and tearing his muscle as it passes through.
Archie grimaces violently in pain.
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Troy fires his pistol. NO SOUND except
for the SLOW MOTION SOUND of the BULLET EXPLODING.
SLOW MOTION: The bullet tears through Iraqi 6's chest.
THE ONLY SOUND is the IRAQI'S HEARTBEAT, the bullet tearing
flesh and crushing bone, and the heartbeat stopping with a
VIOLENT SPLASH. Iraqi 6 falls to the ground with only a dull
thud and the slow clank of his gear.
REGULAR SPEED: Vig swings the mounted machine gun from one
Iraqi to another, but still doesn't shoot. He looks terrified
as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.
Iraqi 7 FIRES twice.
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: a bullet tears into Troy's chest with
a DULL SNAP. He winces in pain.
PAN TO the windshield of the Humvee shatters behind Doc; he
turns and fires his pistol.
PAN TO -- slightly slow motion: NO SOUND EXCEPT THE BULLET
TEARING INTO IRAQI 7'S KNEE, smashing through bone. He falls
to the ground clutching his leg.
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Vig swings the mounted machine gun and
FIRES. NO SOUND BUT THE SLOW CRACKS OF THE RED TRACER BULLETS
EXPLODING from the gun.
SLOW MOTION: tracer bullets slice across the face of Iraqi 5
and Iraqi 2 in the rear, NO SOUND BUT THE BULLETS BREAKING
THROUGH BONE AND FLESH.
SLOW MOTION: Archie jams his pistol under the Major's chin
and FIRES -- the ONLY SOUND IS THE. SLOW EXPLOSION OF THE GUN,
and the slow tearing of tissue, ending with a sharp SNAP as
the tissue, bone, and the bullet CRACK out the top of the
Iraqi Major's head.
HIGH ANGLE LOOKING DOWN -- replay of entire shoot out at
REGULAR SPEED. Ending on the wide-eyed Little Girl with her
hand in her mouth, staring.
ANOTHER ANGLE -- replay of entire shoot out at REGULAR SPEED.
Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.
The dead Iraqi Major lies face down in sand with eyes open;
the Interrogator holds his hand and WEEPS.
Archie's lightly blood-flecked face stares down at the dead
Major, clouds pass overhead.
Dead Iraqi 6 lies with legs twisted under his body.
A rivulet of blood trickles through the sand. A spider runs
across it and gets stuck.
LOW ANGLE up at Doc, stone still, staring straight ahead as
clouds pass slowly above him in the sky.
Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun back and forth.
Troy, drenched in sweat, looks pained as he unbuttons his
shirt: there's a gunshot in his kevlar vest. The slug drops
out of the dent, into his hand -- he exhales.
Iraqis 2, 3, 4, and the Sargeant, throw their hands up in
surrender and drop their weapons.
Big Iraqi 2 walks toward
the Humvee in surrender, and bows down.
Archie points.
ARCHIE GATES
Cover these three.
Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining
Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.
ARCHIE GATES
Doc.
Doc follows Archie over to the three Iraqi soldiers.
DOC
Down.
The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.
IRAQI SOLDIER
Kazal stan hamir in fatar.
Doc takes the Iraqi soldiers' guns and pushes them down.
ARCHIE GATES
Put the Shiites in the Humvee.
TROY
There's no room.
ARCHIE GATES
Make room.
TROY
What the fuck happened to
necessity?
ARCHIE GATES
It just changed.
TROY
Not for me.
Shiites and Iraqi soldiers watch the debate nervously.
ARCHIE GATES
Obey the fucking order, Barlow.
TROY
This is fucked up.
Doc points to the Shiites.
DOC
What if that was you?
Troy displays the gunshot in the Kevlar.
TROY
What if this was you not wearing
Kevlar?
Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK. They turn.
A tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street,
followed by a truck with a rocket launcher.
TROY
Great, a fucking tank. That should
send us on our way.
VIG
Grenade launcher, sir.
Vig struggles to lift the grenade launcher.
ARCHIE GATES
No. Let's get out of here.
TROY
It's about fucking time.
Troy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine.
Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig.
PAN TO the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the
Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee. Doc jumps in.
The tank approaches. The Humvee pulls away. The tank rolls in
from the side, but the tank turret WHINES and CLICKS, stuck
in place. An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank.
TANK IRAQI
Hazal mafan.
He gestures to the whining, stuck, turret. Another Iraqi
tries pushing the turret. The truck with the small rocket
launcher pulls up.
as it bounces along fast. Archie is in pain while Doc pours
disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left
arm, and wraps it. Vig looks terrified as he drives.
Two Iraqi soldiers take a THIN ROCKET, four feet long, and
load a clear plastic canister of brown fluid into it. A
GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, a soldier is hit in the arm.
WHIP PAN TO a Shiite boy with an old rifle in the third floor
window of a small stone building. Iraqis shout and point at
the sniper. The tank turns to the building.
The Humvee drives fast over the bumpy two-lane road.
The tank fires a round at the building which COLLAPSES.
The Iraqi soldiers fire the rocket launcher.
DOC (O.S.)
Incoming.
DAY
Vig turns the speeding Humvee off the road. Archie jerks the
wheel back.
ARCHIE GATES
Stay on the road.
VIG
I don't wanna get hit.
SLOW MOTION: Doc looks straight up with the binoculars.
SLOW MOTION: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke
across the sky.
REAR OF HUMVEE, SLOW MOTION: half the Shiites hunch down,
bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their
necks, looking straight up into the sky. They cower when
there is an EXPLOSION above.
PAN UP TO - REGULAR SPEED: the ROCKET EXPLODES in the sky a
hundred yards above the Humvee -- INTO A BROWN CLOUD.
DOC
Gas.
Troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up
at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast.
Archie and Doc grapple to put on their gas masks. Vig reaches
around behind him for his mask as he drives.
VIG
Where's my mask?
He accidentally veers off the road into the open desert.
ZOOM IN TO a field of mines sitting right on top of the sand,
20 yards ahead. [Iraqi mines were often placed this way]
ZOOM IN ON Archie's alarmed face
ARCHIE GATES
Mine.
Archie dives from the Humvee followed by Vig, Doc, the Man In
Glasses holding the Little Girl, the other Shiites, including
the Two Five Year Olds. The Hummer drives ten yards, hits the
first mine with an explosion and flies into the air --
The airborne Humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is
blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces.
Troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a
halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked Humvee.
SILENCE. A wheel on the wrecked Humvee spin in the air,
squeaking.
Louis Vuitton suitcases are scattered all over. One has
opened and the gold bars are spilled around.
Shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some
limping. They cover their faces with their clothes as the
dense brown fog descends around them.
Vig's right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess -- he
gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down.
Archie puts his gas mask on the Little Girl with arm casts.
Doc takes his mask off when he sees what Archie has done and
gives it to the Shiite Man in Glasses.
Doc picks up Vig's glasses and hands them to Vig, who stands,
blinking his one good eye, while blood streams down his face.
DOC
Cover your face, Conrad. Cover
your mouth, man.
Vig is in shock. Doc lifts Vig's bloody hand to Vig's mouth.
Unseen in the fog, Troy climbs out of the overturned truck.
He picks up two Vuitton hat cases, looks up, sees the TWO
LITTLE CHILDREN from the Humvee, running across a mine field
SCREAMING.
TROY
Hey. Stop.
Troy stands watching as the children run farther away, crying.
TROY
Goddamn it.
He runs, hard, after the children, who are now 70 yards away,
the Vuitton hat cases banging against his legs.
Doc pulls a syringe from a sterile packet, is about to stick
it into his leg when Archie grabs his hand.
ARCHIE GATES
Don't do it, this isn't sarin.
We'd be dead by now.
DOC
Is it mustard?
ARCHIE GATES
It's C.S.
DOC
What's that?
ARCHIE GATES
Tear gas times ten, but it's not
lethal. Where's Barlow?
DOC
I don't know.
Troy chases the children through the brown fog, he drops one
of the suitcases, catches up to the Girl and scoops her up in
his left arm and covers her face with her coat.
TROY'S POV
as he runs between land mines after the Boy, who is way ahead.
BACK TO THE SCENE
Troy drops the other Vuitton bag, catches the Boy and has
both children under his arms like footballs -- when suddenly
Troy is grabbed from behind with a cord around his neck -- he
lands on his back with the two children in his arms.
TROY'S POV LOOKING UP
the Iraqi Interrogator, wearing a gas mask, kicks Troy in the
head. The screaming Children are torn from Troy's arms by
Iraqi soldiers. Troy reaches for his pistol and it is ripped
from his hand as he is dragged to an Iraqi jeep.
ARCHIE GATES
Does anybody see Barlow?
Archie and Doc circle through the thick haze carrying a
Vuitton hat case and cover their mouths and noses.
DOC
I can't even see the truck.
About five Shiites wander around, confused.
VIG
Look out.
Archie spins around, drops the bag and points his pistol.
TWO BLACK ROBED FIGURES pick up Vuitton hat cases.
ARCHIE GATES
Don't move.
A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared
Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.
More black cloaked figures appear. There are THIRTY IN ALL.
Archie, Doc, and Vig look disoriented, point their pistols
around as black robes appear and lead the Shiites away.
VIG
What's going on?
The robes lead the Shiites to a 4 FOOT HIGH TUNNEL ENTRANCE
in a mound of desert earth and disappear into it.
Vig stands and rubs his one good eye. Doc grabs Vig by the
arm and pulls him back toward the tunnel.
DOC
Get in the tunnel.
Vig jerks his arm away.
VIG
Troy.
Doc grabs Vig.
DOC
You're gonna die.
Vig punches Doc in the side of the head. Doc punches Vig in
the stomach. They fall to the ground, fighting.
Archie searches for Troy in the brown haze.
ARCHIE GATES
Barlow.
Two black-robed figures pull Vig off Doc and drag him to the
tunnel. Another robed figure pulls Doc to the tunnel.
Archie walks, looks for Troy, chokes, vomits into the sand.
A black robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back
to the tunnel, where they disappear inside.
Iraqi soldiers strip Troy's clothes as he stands in front of
Oasis Bunker surrounded only by fortress ruins in the desert.
The Iraqi Interrogator pulls off his gas mask.
Two Iraqi tanks are parked to the side. Small numbers of
soldiers and civilians mill about.
IRAQI SOLDIER (SUBTITLES)
Can we shoot him?
IRAQI SOLDIER #2 (SUBTITLES)
We're not even supposed to have
American prisoners.
INTERROGATOR (SUBTITLES)
He's proof they broke the cease-
fire.
A GUN SHOT RINGS OUT. The Iraqis turn to look.
INTERROGATOR
They're taking the tank.
PAN TO 7 Shiites with rifles climb the unmanned Iraqi tank.
4 Iraqi soldiers FIRE back at the Shiites.
Troy, naked, tries to break away in the chaos. He runs a few
feet, is tackled and dragged toward the bunker.
Bill Smithson drives the motorcycle up and stops.
BILL SMITHSON
Start shooting, Paco.
WALTER
I don't like this, we gotta go--
Iraqi soldiers pull them off the motorcycle.
WALTER
Hey.
BILL SMITHSON
Let me handle this.
Shiites rebels sit on top of the captured tank with rifles as
it drives toward the bunker. Iraqi soldiers FIRE on them, but
the turret aims at the bunker and FIRES -- blasting a hole.
Iraqi soldiers shoulder-launch a rocket at the tank,
EXPLODING it. Soldiers shoot into the flaming wreck.
PULL BACK TO Bill Smithson and PACO, the cameraman.
BILL SMITHSON
I'm being held captive by Iraqi
troops in the gritty city of
Karbala, where Shiite --
PACO
You said gritty city again.
BILL SMITHSON
OK, we'll go again.
PACO
What about Private Wogoman, Bill?
BILL SMITHSON
Let's lay a few of these down
first. In three, two, and, I'm
being held captive in a gritty
suburb of Karbala, where Shiite
fundamentalists are rising up --
PAN TO Walter is stripped naked by Iraqi soldiers. Their
CONVERSATION is in ARABIC and SUBTITLED in ENGLISH.
IRAQI CAPTAIN
You better not let that fucking
reporter see you doing this.
IRAQI SARGEANT
Hey, that's the CNN guy.
IRAQI CAPTAIN
Wow. He's much shorter in person.
IRAQI CAPTAIN
Get them out of here now.
LATER
Walter sits on the bike, naked. Bill Smithson in the sidecar,
Paco in the back. Iraqi soldiers pull the tape out.
BILL SMITHSON
At least let me keep the tape.
WALTER
Could I have my helmet, please?
They hand him his socks.
WALTER
Helmet. On my head.
They give Walter his helmet, with built-in radio headset.
GENERAL HORN
Who's missing?
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Is Doc here?
The White Assistant shakes his head 'NO.'
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Doc's not here?
GENERAL HORN
You don't know where one of your
own fucking aides is?
CAPTAIN VAN METER
How about Barlow?
The White Assistant shakes his head 'NO.'
GENERAL HORN
Check all the radio transmissions.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
I run a tight company, Ron. Don't
break my bails.
GENERAL HORN
I'm not breaking your balls, Doug,
I want to find these guys.
Archie climbs out of a small mound in the desert, squints in
the light and looks around.
A strange minaret stretches skyward from the flat desert, 200
yards away. The minaret is made of yellow stone, it twists
150 feet into the air, like a twisting wedding cake.
Archie leads the others toward the minaret. No one is around,
except for a few black robes. Archie, Doc, and Vig enter the
old wooden doorway of the ancient Minaret.
DAY
Archie leads a line of 55 Shiites across the desert. Everyone
carries at least one Vuitton bag. Imam carries his daughter.
VIG
You got the same name as the tall
model who does David Bowie.
DOC
That's Im-an, with an 'n.' He's
Imam with an 'm.'
VIG
That's the same name.
DOC
It's not the same name.
VIG
Whatever. They're both attractive
names.
Archie crouches low to the ground, moving quickly,
secretively. He turns and makes a hand signal to, Doc, 20
yards away, who turns and makes a hand signal to Vig.
HIGH WIDE SHOT: A lone Iraqi military truck, mint condition.'
Archie, Vig, and Doc form a semicircle, surrounding the
truck. They are all 40 yards back from the truck.
ARCHIE GATES
This is the United States Army.
Come out of the truck with your
weapons in the air.
No response. Suddenly Vig's pistol FIRES.
VIG
Shit. Sorry.
His gunshot blows a hole in the Iraqi truck -- which deflates
like a huge beach ball, circling wildly until it lies in a
heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while 50 yards away --
55 SHIITES flip sand-colored blankets off and stand up in the
desert to look. Doc lifts the limp canvass of the deflated
truck.
ARCHIE GATES
They used a lot of decoys to throw
off our bombers.
DOC
Where are we gonna get a vehicle?
IMAM
I know a place that's full of
deserters. Maybe they got
something.
HIGH WIDE SHOT: They walk in a single file line in the
desert.
Archie in front, carries a Vuitton bag.
Archie now walks among Shiites toting old rifles. There are
bomb craters, destroyed cars, a few mud dwellings nearby.
SHIITE
America!
SHIITE #2
America! Friend!
SHIITE
Freedom! Thank you to America!
Shiites cheer and pat Archie, Doc and Vig on the back as they
walk to a bunker built into the side of a small hill. TWO
IRAQI SOLDIERS come out smiling to embrace a disoriented
Archie and Doc.
The luxury cars ride across the desert, single file, Vuitton
bags strapped to the roofs.
Shiites finish passing 92 Vuitton suitcases into a trench.
The bags are buried. Archie drives a stake to mark the spot.
ARCHIE GATES
We get our man, we come back to
pick up the gold --
IMAM
And my people.
ARCHIE GATES
My gold isn't here, and I mean all
of it, your people will not
survive.
Doc and Vig pull off distributor caps from the Cadillacs and
Limousine (but not the Jaguar) and put them in Doc's pack.
IMAM
I understand.
ARCHIE GATES
OK. Let's load and go.
Imam hugs and kisses his daughter goodbye and tries to put
her, crying, into the arms of an older woman.
VIG
Wait a second, I want to talk
about this plan some more --
ARCHIE GATES
We're going to drive in and get
Troy, exactly like we discussed.
VIG
I have a bad feeling like we're
gonna get wasted.
ARCHIE GATES
You're scared. It's good to be
scared when there's guns around.
Vig looks uneasy. Archie hums Bach's 'Gloria' and moves a
hand in the air, then puts his hands on Vig's shoulders and
SINGS THE BACH LOUD. Vig eventually joins in the chorus.
DOC
I'm cool. I'm all right.
He lies down and breathes with a hand on his chest as Archie
and Vig keep singing.
Bach's B Minor Mass plays as the Mercedes, Infiniti, and
Rolls Royce Drive across the desert.
Archie, Doc, Vig, stand on a sand ridge and look down on the
Oasis bunker in the distance. Behind them are the three cars,
Imam, and a handful of Shiite gunmen. They get into the cars.
An empty ridge. The Infiniti, Rolls, Mercedes shoot over it,
arcing down toward the bunker, engines roaring.
It is quiet. A Slim Jim is unwrapped as an IRAQI GUARD slowly
raises it to his mouth, bites it, chews, and looks puzzled at
the cars approaching in the distance.
HIGH WIDE SHOT - looking straight down.
The cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the
bunker. The Infiniti is in the middle, flanked by the Rolls
on the left and the Mercedes on the right.
TWO IRAQI GUARDS, one chewing a Slim Jim, look bewildered as
they stare at the circling Infiniti fifty yards away.
Iraqi soldiers fire a grenade that blows up right behind the
Rolls as Doc skids right up to a rear entrance of the bunker,
the grill touching the metal door. Doc parks, blockading the
rear door shut, and, with three Shiite riflemen, jumps out.
Vig and the Shiite bail out of the moving Infiniti. Wads of
plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it
speeds towards the bunker, then drifts to the side --
VIG
Go straight, go straight --
He jumps up and down and points, but the Infiniti goes far to
the side of the bunker and explodes into some ruins. The two
guards point their guns at Vig and the Shiite and they run
into the desert as bullets pop around them.
Archie skids the Mercedes to a halt on the right side of the
bunker, jumps out, slams the door, followed by Imam and the
two other Shiites.
They run toward the bunker, Archie with a wad of plastic
explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in
the other. He HEARS the CHIRP of a car alarm being activated
as he runs to the bunker.
Imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker, pulls
off a grill. Archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic
explosive, and drops it into the vent.
The parked Rolls Royce blockades the rear door.
Archie and Imam run back to the Mercedes, but the car is
locked, his pistol sits inside on the front seat. A GUNSHOT
from the bunker roof shatters the window of the Mercedes,
setting off THE CAR ALARM.
Archie reaches in, grabs his pistol, and bolts as a launched
grenade blows the Mercedes.
12 Iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as 3 Shiite
riflemen with Doc fire on them. Two Iraqis go down, with only
the sound of bullets piercing their flesh.
6 Iraqis run for it, into the desert. 2 Iraqis throw their
hands up in surrender while 2 look ambivalent, one holds a
stack of new Levis. Doc raises a hand to stop his Shiite
gunmen from firing, but they fire anyway and 3 Iraqis fire
back -- the Shiite next to Doc is hit in the face.
DOC
Stop shooting, what's the matter
with you?
He reaches out and holds the rifle of a Shiite. Everyone
stops firing, slowly the Iraqis drop their guns. Doc has WET
HIS PANTS.
Archie runs up from the right, grabs Doc's arm and they run
past surrendering Iraqi soldiers and into the front entrance.
of the bunker. Imam takes cover on the side of the bunker
while Shiites and Iraqis aim at each other.
Vig approaches cautiously from the desert, HEARS AN AIRCRAFT,
and looks up. An Iraqi helicopter comes in fast and opens
FIRE with MACHINE GUNS --
VIG
Shit.
Vig runs toward the bunker for cover, but is cut off by
MACHINE GUN FIRE from THE CHOPPER. Shiites FIRE rifles up at
the chopper.
DAY
Vig and the six Shiites frantically search for cover.
The chopper FIRES and one of the Shiites running with Vig is
hit in the head, thrown by the force of the gunshot into Vig,
who goes down, faking it.
Vig lies face down, out of breath, with the dead Shiite on
top of him while the chopper hovers above.
VIG
Jesus God, I don't wanna get hit,
please Jesus, watch over me --
The chopper hovers right there. It FIRES A GRENADE which
EXPLODES next to Archie and Troy. They scramble back into the
bunker.
Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands
and knees with the dead Shiite on his back.
VIG
You gotta be my disguise, Mr.
Shiite, cuz they need my help over
there --
The six Iraqis who took oft from the bunker are still
running. Their CONVERSATION is in ARABIC and SUBTITLED in
ENGLISH.
TOUGH IRAQI
Let's go back and get them.
IRAQI #2
Fuck a donkey, no way.
TOUGH IRAQI
There's a chopper, we can do it.
He and another Iraqi stop while the other two keep running.
TOUGH IRAQI
They killed your families, you
fucking cowards.
The Tough Iraqi and his partner, sweating profusely, out of
breath, split up and head back toward the bunker.
Imam, lying in a ditch, is concealed on the side of the
bunker, and aims an old rifle at the chopper.
GUNSHOTS ring off the side of the chopper, chipping plastic.
The chopper banks toward Vig in response.
Vig watches the chopper turn toward him.
VIG
God help me.
Archie FIRES his pistol as he goes out the door with Troy,
also FIRING a pistol. Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning.
Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up.
Archie, Troy, Doc, stunned -- turn back to the bunker.
Imam, from the side of the bunker, FIRES again, the chopper
swivels toward him to RETURN FIRE --
SLOW TO FREEZE FRAME MID-STRIDE -- with just THE SOUND OF THE
CHOPPER: Archie, Doc, Troy, three abreast, mid-stride.
RESUME REGULAR SPEED -- Doc unleashes the football.
PAN TO - SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- the ball hits the chopper
broadside and THE CHOPPER EXPLODES INTO A BALL OF FIRE.
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: The chopper comes crashing to the
ground in a heap of metal. The rotary spins off, whips over
Archie, Troy, and Doc's heads and smashes into the bunker.
Silence.
Troy and Doc look at each other, and punch their fists
together. Troy notices that he's wet his pants.
ARCHIE GATES
We're not done. Check every Iraqi
here.
Archie rolls over bodies lying on the ground, pulls out their
weapons. Troy and Doc take rifles from wounded Iraqis.
TROY
(agitated)
Where's Conrad?
ARCHIE GATES
Don't let your guard down.
Doc nervously scans the area with his pistol pointed.
50 Shiite prisoners start streaming out of the bunker.
ARCHIE GATES
Stay there, don't move.
Imam directs the Shiites to stay clustered near the bunker.
IMAM
Jakar yizam ut naral --
TROY
How are we getting back?
DOC
We got the Rolls.
An IRAQI SOLDIER jumps up just as Archie knocks him to the
ground from behind and twists the gun away. Doc binds the
soldier's hands with a plastic cuff.
TROY
You got a Rolls?
ARCHIE GATES
It's been a busy day.
Archie pulls pistols from the bloody bodies of the two Iraqis
in the chopper.
TROY
Hey. That's a convertible.
He points to the flaming wrecked Infiniti.
ARCHIE GATES
Keep your fucking guard up.
TROY
Is that leather interior?
DOC
I think he's in shock.
TROY
It's a fucking Infiniti
convertible, isn't it?
DOC
Yes.
TROY
OK. So I owe you a car. I'm not in
shock.
ARCHIE GATES
We can talk about cars later, OK?
TROY
Freeze --
He points his pistol at Imam.
IMAM
Take it easy.
TROY
Who is this guy?
ARCHIE GATES
He's with us.
Troy and Imam look at each other a moment, Troy still points
his pistol at Imam.
TROY
You're the guy with the little
girl.
IMAM
That's right.
TROY
What are you doing here?
ARCHIE GATES
He helped us find you.
TROY
All right. You're all right.
He hugs Imam.
TROY
How's your girl?
IMAM
She's safe. For the moment.
TROY
All right. Excellent. How can we
help?
DOC
Calm down, man.
TROY
I'm calm. Don't I look calm?
IMAM
We had a deal to get us to the
border, but we need more vehicles
for these people.
Troy moves nervously.
TROY
We're gonna work it out. We can do
it. We have to work it out.
DOC
I'm not sure how. This is a lot of
people.
TROY
OK, you choose who we take. You
tell the others it's not
convenient, they'll have to die.
DOC
Take it easy, man.
TROY
You think I don't know what I'm
saying. I know what I'm saying.
We're gonna do more than steal,
that's what I'm saying. We're
gonna help these people out.
IMAM
This guy was worth saving.
ARCHIE GATES
He's a soldier.
Troy and Archie look at each other, smile slightly.
VIG (O.S.)
Yes. Yes. All right.
They all turn to look.
WIDE SHOT -- Vig pops up in the desert, 150 yards away.
VIG
You made it.
Vig comes running.
VIG
I thought that was you. Yeah.
Troy smiles as he steps in the direction of Vig. Suddenly a
RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps.
SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY
THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is
jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering
toward Troy, 125 yards away.
Troy looks stunned.
Archie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle.
An IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground
as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire.
Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig.
ARCHIE GATES
Cover him.
Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie
scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out.
ARCHIE GATES
Lock it down. Shoot anything that
moves.
IMAM
(translates)
Haza janav yasat.
Troy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and
embraces him. Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's
shoulder, as Vig tries to talk.
VIG
You made it, man --
Troy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms.
TROY
Help him.
Doc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the
ground, cradling his head in his lap. Vig spits blood.
VIG
What happened to the Jesus fire,
Doc?
DOC
It's around you right now, man, it
works on this side or the other
side.
VIG
You never told me that part. I
guess I could go to one of them
shrines that erase the bad you
did --
TROY
We made the right choice today,
Conrad.
VIG
We did good, right?
TROY
We made the right choice.
The hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. Troy puts
his hands over it. Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to
turns Vig's head to help him breathe.
DOC
Dear Lord watch over this man,
help him if you can. Our father
who art in heaven --
50 Shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near
the bunker watch from afar.
Troy stands up looking around helplessly.
TROY
Help.
DOC
-- hallowed be thy name, thy
kingdom come, thy will be done --
A gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy
in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches
over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the
sound of tearing tissue. Troy looks stunned as he is spun
around by the shot.
Archie spins around in the desert and looks at Troy.
ARCHIE GATES
Goddamn it.
He runs hard across the desert toward Troy.
Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other.
Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great
difficulty -- RASPING.
Troy's eyes are wide, staring up at the Girl as he has great
difficulty breathing. Archie rolls Troy's shirt up, exposing
Troy's chest, with the bullet wound. Archie points to a spot
on Troy's upper chest, near the collar bone --
Doc squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel onto this
spot -- the only sounds are the squirt of the ointment and
Troy's breathing.
Archie looks nervous, then focussed as he brings the shiny
metal scalpel down. Troy is in great pain as he watches
Archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest. Archie twists
the scalpel to open the incision wide --
There is a pronounced HISSING as trapped air rushes out. Huge
relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally.
Regular sound FADES BACK IN, THE FIRST SOUND IS THE GIRL'S
THIN, INTERMITTENT HUMMING --
TROY'S POV FROM THE GROUND, LOOKING UP
ARCHIE GATES
I've been waiting 18 years to get
that right.
He tears open a short I.V. tube and plunges the I.V. into the
scalpel hole. There is a small valve on the end of the tube,
which he tightens.
A GUNSHOT SOUNDS -- Archie turns and looks over --
FIVE SHIITE RIFLE MEN chase down and shoot, at 30 yards, the
last Iraqi gunner in the desert.
Troy sits up slowly and watches for a moment.
Shiite women and children chant and pray around Vig's corpse
as it lies in the open trunk of the Jaguar. Archie, Troy and
Doc stand together watching. Troy and Doc do a muted version
of Vig's Karate arm dance as they look down at his corpse.
TROY
He's got no family.
Archie sadly takes Vig's big pistol from Vig's clenched hand.
ARCHIE GATES
We're his family now.
DOC
He wanted to go to one of those
shrines.
IMAM
Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.
Archie takes Vig's glasses off.
ARCHIE GATES
Good. Take him.
Archie fills a single rusted oil drum with gold bars and
tapes it shut. Troy sits in a folding chair nearby. He looks
pained and uncomfortable.
ARCHIE GATES
Air pressure will build up about
every fifteen minutes. Release the
valve, close it up again.
Archie unscrews the valve on the tube in Troy's chest, and
air hisses out. Troy looks relieved. Archie closes the valve.
TROY
How long can I keep doing this?
ARCHIE GATES
Maybe four hours, if you're not
bleeding too bad inside.
TROY
I'm really thirsty.
DOC
There's no water anywhere.
IMAM
(to Archie)
I got you hooked up if you want to
call your man.
Archie operates a radio hooked up to a car battery.
ARCHIE GATES
(into the radio)
Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do
you read me?
DOC
We're gonna be court-martialed.
ARCHIE GATES
No, we're not.
Troy watches, tense.
ARCHIE GATES
(into the radio)
Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are
you reading this?
Walter drives the motorcycle, nude, wearing his helmet with
radio attachment. Smithson and Paco ride along.
Archie is heard in a crackling radio transmission inside
Walter's helmet. Walter speaks into the small mouthpiece.
WALTER
(into radio)
This is Tar Baby, come in.
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
Where are you?
WALTER
(into radio)
About two clicks outside camp.
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
We're about ready for the briar
patch, over.
WALTER
(into the radio)
Right.
He looks uncertain, worried.
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
You got me, Tar Baby?
WALTER
I think so -- who handles the
briar patch?
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
You do.
WALTER
Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to
the briar patch if everything's
OK, right?
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.)
No, the other way around.
WALTER
Shit, I'm sorry, sir, I don't
remember how the code goes --
INTERCUT WITH Archie, who looks exasperated. He is sweating
with a fever and his arm hurts.
ARCHIE GATES
Six personnel trucks and a Humvee.
WALTER
Wow. That's a tall order for a
secret operation, sir.
ARCHIE GATES
Talk to my friend Hash. Each
driver will get 100K.
WALTER
Did you say 100K?
ARCHIE GATES
Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North.
Add one medavac pack to the order,
and dump the reporter.
WALTER
Roger. Give me two hours.
Doc cracks open a snow globe with pliers as all the water and
dollars drain out. Imam filters the water through a cheese
cloth held above an urn.
CLOSE ON the plastic Three Kings and Baby Jesus with the
Mobil gas station glisten in the wet palm of Archie's hand.
Archie looks at the Three Kings in his hand.
Troy cracks open a snow globe, filters water with a Shiite.
Dozens of Shiites are doing the same.
Archie passes an urn to some parched Shiites who drink the
water thirstily. Troy, Doc do the same.
Captain Van Meter, General Horn, and two radio decoders stand
looking at logs of transmissions.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
There's so many transmissions --
GENERAL HORN
Narrow it down to what sounds like
Archie Gates and a Humvee.
A Humvee with HAVICHON and Walter drives by behind the
oblivious General, leading a convoy of several trucks.
GENERAL HORN
I want a direction, we're not
gonna comb the whole goddamn
desert --
A PRIVATE runs up and hands General Horn a paper.
PRIVATE
This is from Barlow's C.O. at Fort
Bragg, something with his wife.
GENERAL HORN
(reads)
Fort Bragg? I'll be damned.
Walter and Hash drive past Smithson and Paco and Cathy.
BILL SMITHSON
Where the hell is he going now?
CATHY DAITCH
I say we keep watching the General.
She takes off and Smithson follows her.
DAY
Imam pours gasoline on a pile of Vuitton suitcases,
Troy throws a match, the suitcases go up in a rush of fire.
Imam hands two gold bars to a Shiite peasant, who takes them
and moves on. There are two long lines of Shiite peasants
patiently waiting to get their gold, as it is handed out by
Imam and another Shiite while, Archie, Troy, and Doc watch.
Shiites stash their gold bars inside their clothing and bags.
LATER
Everyone sits and waits: Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his
daughter, 105 Shiite peasants.
Troy looks pained, then releases the valve on the tube
sticking through his chest bandage and there is a hiss of
air. He looks relieved.
There is the SOUND OF DISTANT MOTORS RUMBLING. An approaching
convoy in the desert: six open U.S. personnel trucks, led by
a Humvee.
Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, dozens of Shiites
watch the convoy approaching -- they hold their guns ready.
The U.S. Military trucks and the Humvee pull up to the bunker.
Walter stands in the front of the Humvee with Hash, both
wearing sand goggles as they pull up -- Walter salutes.
HAVICHON
Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got
yourself shot.
ARCHIE GATES
Those better be words of sympathy.
6 ARMY DRIVERS, among them the disillusioned infantrymen
interviewed by Bill Smithson earlier, get out of their
vehicles, greeted by Doc, Archie, and Imam.
Walter walks up, carrying a medical pack.
WALTER
Watcha doing out here, Troy?
They bang fists in greeting.
TROY
Protecting the free peoples of the
world, Walter, you know how it is.
WALTER
We better get you fixed up to go
home to the land of the brave.
Walter pushes an I.V. needle into Troy's arm.
TROY
Give me that penicillin, baby.
Doc pushes an I.V. needle into Archie's arm and tapes the
penicillin sack to Archie's shirt.
HAVICHON
Where ees bullion at, my man?
ARCHIE GATES
Bullion ees buried. I'll show you
after we get these people to the
border.
HAVICHON
Iranian border?
ARCHIE GATES
Part of the deal.
HAVICHON
C'est super, Archie, you got
yourself a pain in the ass mission
of mercy.
WALTER
Sorry I fucked up the code, sir.
ARCHIE GATES
It means we gotta move. They might
be coming for us.
Bach's "Gloria" plays powerfully.
Shiites pile into the six open trucks. The lone oil can full
of gold is loaded, as well. Imam and his daughter are helped
into a truck by Doc. Archie whistles loud from the front seat
of the Humvee -- which leads the way as the convoy pulls out.
Doc, in the back of a truck with Shiites, waves.
Troy smiles as he sits in the back of a crowded truck with
Imam, his daughter, and other Shiites.
HIGH, WIDE CURVING HELICOPTER SHOT
The six truck convoy, led by the Humvee, rolls across the two-
lane desert road.
SIX APACHE CHOPPERS are ROARING on the ground as Captain Van
Meter, his White Assistant, and General Horn board a chopper.
Smithson, Paco, and Cathy and her CAMERA MAN rush aboard the
last chopper in the line.
The Humvee slows to a halt.
Archie stands in the front of the Humvee with a rifle at his
side -- looking straight ahead -- concerned. Troy, Doc, Imam,
and daughter stare ahead, concerned
50 yards ahead -- a low wall of razor wire.
100 yards beyond it, dozens of Iraqi tanks are lined up along
the border, 100 feet apart, stretching into the distance
either way. There are 50 IRAQI GROUND TROOPS standing at the
border station, marked by razor wire on the one-lane road.
On the far side of the border, IRANIAN SOLDIERS with RELIEF
WORKERS wearing RED CRESCENTS wait by white school buses and
stare at the American convoy.
Archie stares at the border, thinking.
Imam helps Troy down from the truck. Doc carries the Little
Girl.
HAVICHON
What are you seenking?
ARCHIE GATES
I see an opening we can walk
through. But it's not wide enough
for a truck.
Archie gets out of the Humvee and looks at the border.
ARCHIE GATES
We'll walk them to the border. The
Iranians will take them. We'll
walk back to the trucks and get
out of here.
Doc turns and signals to the drivers to come up.
Troy takes the safety off his M-16.
5 U.S.Drivers get out with their rifles ready. They release
the safeties. Havichon, with his leg in a cast, stays back to
man the mounted machine gun on the Humvee. Iraqi soldiers on
the border nervously watch the Americans and the Shiites,
holding their machine guns.
ARCHIE GATES
Make a close group.
IMAM
(translates)
Jihad yamat -- yamat.
105 Shiites empty the trucks and gather in a crowd that walks
toward the border. Two Shiite men carry Vig's body, wrapped
in Arabic cloths.
Archie, Troy, Doc, lead the crowd single file through a
narrow opening in the razor wire. On the other side, the
crowd spreads out and keeps walking. Archie, Troy, and Doc
walk three abreast, 7 feet apart, rifles ready.
Imam and Walter are behind, flanking them.
FACES: CLOSE DOLLY - SHIITE Children, Women, Men, as they
fearfully walk toward the border. The five U.S. Drivers flank
the Shiites on either side, rifles ready.
PAN TO - Troy suddenly drops to one knee.
DOC
Let the air out.
TROY
It's not the air, I don't know
what it is --
DOC
Stay back.
TROY
I'm all right. I'm just dizzy or
something --
Iranian soldiers and relief workers stand watching.
PAN AROUND TO - IRANIAN SIDE POV
The backs of the Iraqi troops and tanks, and the approaching
Shiites and Americans, walking in the distance.
Archie helps Troy as they walk three abreast with Doc.
CHOPPERS ARE HEARD in the distance. They grow LOUDER. Imam
turns and looks back. Archie turns around and looks.
SIX APACHE CHOPPERS approach from the distance
CLOSE DOLLY Archie.
ARCHIE GATES
Double time.
He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy
cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others.
The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and
Walter look up also. Archie does not.
Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the
choppers as they pass overhead, loud.
PAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in
the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his
path, blowing up dust.
Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the
blowing sand.
10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers,
followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles.
Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively.
M.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from
the Shiites.
Troy shouts over the choppers.
TROY
Wait.
U.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border.
The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward
the border unaccompanied by American protection.
ARCHIE GATES
Let them get over the border.
Troy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest.
TROY
Let them get over, wait --
Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back.
TROY
I have to reach this --
Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front --
ARCHIE GATES
Put his cuffs in front.
He and Doc are pulled away from Troy.
Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them,
throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at
this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is
thrown to the ground and dragged.
TROY
Look what's happening.
He collapses to one knee.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
Not our mission, Barlow.
Troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs
prevent him from releasing his valve. Troy struggles.
TROY
Cut my cuffs --
Captain Van Meter leans down to Troy. He shouts over the
choppers.
CAPTAIN VAN METER
You fucked me and you're fucked
now, so shut your goddamn mouth.
Shiites are lined up in a firing squad.
DOC
He's gonna die.
Troy lies on the ground suffocating. Archie drags the MP
holding him as he goes to General Horn.
ARCHIE GATES
Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical
attention, don't let him die --
GENERAL HORN
We are not involved in the Shiite
problem, do you understand
me? You are AWOL, you are a
fugitive, you are under arrest.
ARCHIE GATES
Cut his cuffs.
General Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground,
concerned.
A US SOLDIER stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in
his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade,
crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing
by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with
difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes.
Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border.
Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's
body is dropped in the sand.
ARCHIE GATES
We got the gold.
GENERAL HORN
What?
ARCHIE GATES
We got the Kuwaiti bullion.
GENERAL HORN
Bullshit.
Archie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward
the lead truck -- where MPs grab and wrestle him down.
ARCHIE GATES
Pull that barrel.
GENERAL HORN
Pull it.
An MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold
bars spill to the sand.
The General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody,
watch.
The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers --
and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET.
THE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in
custody -- stand and watch Archie.
GENERAL HORN
How much do you have?
ARCHIE GATES
4 tons.
General Horn picks up a gold brick.
GENERAL HORN
Where's it at?
TROY
Get them over first.
ARCHIE GATES
They helped us get it, Ron. I made
a deal, and that's soldier's
honor. You can't fuck them now.
General Horn looks at Archie.
ARCHIE GATES
You can return this gold, be a big
hero, get another star maybe.
Everyone stares at General Horn. After a pause, the General
fires his pistol into the air.
Iraqi soldiers freeze as they are about to fire on the
Shiites.
GENERAL HORN
Let's go, Doug.
Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk 40 yards to the
frozen Iraqi soldiers and the terrified Shiites.
Archie, Troy, Doc in handcuffs with MPS, watch.
Walter and the other U.S. Soldiers watch from afar as
Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk into the midst of
Iraqi soldiers.
GENERAL HORN
Who's in charge here?
An OLDER IRAQI GENERAL steps forward and salutes.
GENERAL HORN
We have to talk about this
situation.
Archie, Troy, Doc, U.S. soldiers watch from a distance.
ARCHIE'S POV FROM AFAR
General Horn talks to the Iraqi general.
BACK TO THE SCENE
U.S. Soldiers watch.
TROY'S POV FROM AFAR
General Horn and Captain Van Meter walk back toward them.
It is QUIET. No one says anything.
Pan across Paco taping.
BILL SMITHSON
In a morbid tableau these men have
recovered some of the gold bullion
stolen from Kuwait --
CATHY DAITCH
--in violation of American policy,
saved over a hundred Shiite
refugees while recovering stolen
Kuwaiti gold --
GENERAL HORN
Turn that damn camera off.
He walks up and forcibly pushes the camera to the ground, Van
Meter pushes Cathy's camera down.
BILL SMITHSON
That's a 75 thousand dollar
camera --
GENERAL HORN
What the fuck are they doing here?
SARGEANT
I thought they were authorized --
GENERAL HORN
They are not fucking authorized,
for Christ's sake --
MPs take the tapes from the cameras.
GENERAL HORN
Haven't I taken care of you,
dammit?
He signals the choppers to start up.
THE CHOPPER ENGINES SLOWLY WHINE into gear.
CATHY DAITCH
I'm gonna get that tape back.
General Horn walks over to Troy, Archie, and Doc.
GENERAL HORN
You are under arrest. You are
going to be court-martialed. And
you will show us where the bullion
is right now.
He walks into a chopper, which is now revving at full speed.
PAN TO Troy, Archie, Doc turn to the border and watch.
Walter, the handcuffed Drivers, the MPS and other U.S.
Soldiers also watch.
The Shiites are released by the Iraqis. They collect
themselves and gather in a group. The group walks over the
border and is received by the relief workers.
Troy, Archie, Doc watch. A U.S. Soldier WHISTLES through the
loud choppers.
SOLDIER #10
Yeah.
Then another Soldier joins in, WHISTLING and CLAPPING.
Then another soldier, until all twenty U.S.
Soldiers and MPs present are whistling and cheering Troy,
Archie, and Doc as they stand there while the choppers throb.
50 yards away: Imam holds his daughter, on the Iran side,
about to get into a Red Crescent bus.
Imam and his daughter wave.
Archie raises his handcuffed wrists to wave back; Troy and
Doc follow, raising their cuffed hands to wave.
Freeze frame.
