A messy yard on a clear winter evening, string lights and 
patches of old snow; A Caja China pig roasting box is 
smoking.  In attendance are Piper, LARRY, KIRSTEN, and PETE.  
Kirsten is about seven months pregnant.  Pete and Larry walk 
over to the box to sniff it.  Piper and Kirsten are seated 
nearby warming themselves by a firepit.

ANGLE ON PIPER AND KIRSTEN:

Piper holds a cocktail, Kirsten, something non-alcoholic.

We follow Piper and Larry s Fiat through gates and up a hill 
to a parking lot.  Before them looms a hulking building with 
a triple-layer razor-wire fence.  A sign outside it reads--

  FACILITY  CORRECTIONS FEDERAL  STANSBURY

They pull into a spot between two other cars.  A white pick-
up truck with police lights pulls up in front them.  Piper 
opens her window and leans out.  ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK           "Pilot"               JENJI DRAFT  13.

A TEN YEARS YOUNGER PIPER in a bikini stands on a small, 
slippery rock at the top of a towering waterfall.  Thirty 
five feet below is a river pool of indiscernible depth.  
Another woman in a bikini, a few years older than Piper, ALEX 
VAUSE, is on a rock right next to her, and a native guide, 
GUIDE MAN, stand behind them.  They yell to be heard above 
the roar of the falls.

Piper summons all her courage and strength, and then flings 
herself off the rock, shrieking as she plunges into the green 
gorge below.  She bursts the surface, laughing.

PIPER
Whooooo!  That was awesome!  Holy 
shit.  Alex? ... Alex!  

Where s Alex?  Alex is still above on her rock.  Alex is not 
going to jump.  Alex is shaking her head and climbing back 
up.  Piper is alone in the water with the thundering falls.
