BACKYARD - MORNING
Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the
backyard.
He spins as he looks around.
Merrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side
stairs adjacent to the garage building.
Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each
other across the yard.
MERRILL
Where are they?
Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes.
CHILDREN
(yelling in the distance)
Daaaad!
Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the
YELLING.
They look away from the house, across the yard and
into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS.
CUT TO:
CROPS - MORNING
The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as
they run through the crops.
A LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them
like an apparition.
She is in her nightgown.
She is four.
They reach her fast.
She stands unaware of them in a daze.
Her hair is messed from sleep.
GRAHAM
Bo where's Morgan?
BO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.
Beat.
GRAHAM
Bo?
Bo finally looks at her father.
Beat.
She smiles softly.
BO
Are you in my dreams too?
Beat.
GRAHAM
This isn't a --
BOY (O.S.)
Dad!
Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE.
He's
close.
Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.
He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his
pajama bottoms.
DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.
GRAHAM
Morgan what's happening?
Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of
Morgan.
The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.
Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's
looking straight at him.
GRAHAM
Are... you... hurt?
Beat.
Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.
MORGAN
I think God did it.
Beat.
THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.
GRAHAM
Did what Morgan?
Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his
face.
Graham is forced to look to his right.
Beat.
Graham
sees something.
Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet.
He starts moving
forward towards something.
He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a
clearing.
Two German Shepherds are running back and forth.
They are clearly agitated.
Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING
FLAT ON THE GROUND.
THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED
FEET WIDE.
Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the
center.
Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.
The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL
THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF
THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.
WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE
HUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,
UNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.
LEGEND:
"BUCKS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA...
THIRTY MILES OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA"
CUT TO:
BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME
Graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the
right temperature.
The other hand holds a cordless phone to
his ear.
GRAHAM
(into phone)
... Lee actually the reason I'm
calling is about Lionel.
Graham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.
GRAHAM
(into phone)
Was he at home last night with you
or was he out and about with the
Wolfington brothers?
Graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads
towards the house.
GRAHAM
(into phone)
Well, there was a little mischief
done to our crops last night.
Beat.
GRAHAM
(into phone)
I know he's a fine boy... No one's
saying otherwise.
Graham steps through the back screen door into his
KITCHEN.
Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED
VOICE.
GRAHAM
(into phone)
Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it
was him.
You could just talk to
him and that would be enough for
me... See it was kind of strange
finding the crops like that.
The
kids were... confused by it.
It
would take the strangeness away if
we knew it was Lionel and the
Wolfington brothers just messing
around...
(beat, listens)
The movies...
(beat)
Are you sure?
(beat)
Okay, then... Thank you for your
patience Lee.
Graham turns off the phone.
He turns to put it on the
counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen
floor with one of their two German Shepherds.
There is a
LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.
MORGAN
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.
Graham looks at the majestic dog.
It's shivering.
GRAHAM
Take him outside.
I'll call Dr.
Reynolds.
Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on
their faces.
Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the
puddle of urine.
The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his
knees on the kitchen floor.
He leans back so he can see down
the hall.
A balding police officer stands on the other side of the
screen door.
GRAHAM
That was quick Edgar.
I only
called you boys about two hours
ago.
OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.
OFFICER PASKI
Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as
she put it, "diving for her life"
when a bunch of school kids rode
down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thorton's store
this morning and started spitting
on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
By the time I got there, Mrs.
Kindleman had sprayed the whole
damn place... She must have had a
cold or something.
It was enough
to turn a grown man's stomach.
Beat.
Graham stares at Officer Paski.
OFFICER PASKI
So what happened to your crops?
CUT TO:
BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME
Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water.
She
moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table.
Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the
grill.
He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,
before walking over to Houdini.
The two children sit down in the grass with the dog.
Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl.
She stops.
Takes a tiny sip of the water first.
She holds the glass out to Morgan.
BO
I think it's contaminated.
MORGAN
You don't even know what that word
means.
He drinks.
MORGAN
It's not contaminated.
It's just
tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
BO
It tastes funny.
MORGAN
He licks his butt everyday.
He's
not going to mind.
Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.
Beat.
Houdini just sits staring at them.
He is not shivering.
He
doesn't drink.
He is unnaturally still.
Bo pushes the bowl closer.
HOUDINI MOVES...
BO'S HAND PULLS BACK...
HOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO
BE.
HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER...
BEAT.
The children turn white.
MORGAN
Houdini?
HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL.
Bo stands up.
MORGAN
Bo don't run.
Houdini crouches down.
MORGAN
What's wrong boy?
THE DOG'S GROWL BECOMES DEEP, MENACING.
MORGAN
Stop it Houdini!
The German Shepherd trembles.
His body tightens.
He's about
to leap.
Beat.
MORGAN
(soft)
Bo, run.
CUT TO:
CROPS - LUNCHTIME
Officer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away.
They are on opposite ends of the crop circle.
Beat.
The crops all around them sway as the wind blows.
Beat.
Officer Paski yells over the wind.
OFFICER PASKI
(yelling)
It's the strangest thing Father.
GRAHAM
(yelling)
Don't call me Father.
OFFICER PASKI
(yelling)
What's that?
GRAHAM
(yelling)
Don't call me Father.
It's just
Graham now.
OFFICER PASKI
(yelling)
Sorry.
They stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each
other.
Beat.
GRAHAM
(yelling)
You said something was strange.
What's strange?
OFFICER PASKI
(yelling)
The footprints.
GRAHAM
(yelling)
What about them?
OFFICER PASKI
(yelling)
There are none.
CUT TO:
CORN CROPS - LUNCHTIME
Officer Paski's knee touches the ground.
He points to a
single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side.
OFFICER PASKI
(soft)
Look at where it's bent over.
Graham stands next to him and leans in.
The joint where the
stalk bends from the ground is a perfect "L".
GRAHAM
It's not broken.
OFFICER PASKI
What kind of machine can bend a
stalk of corn over without cracking
it?
Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn
stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave.
GRAHAM
(softy)
Can't be by hand... It's too
perfect.
Beat.
OFFICER PASKI
Doesn't sound much like Lionel
Prichard and the Wolfington
brothers.
They can't take a piss
without wetting the front of their
pants.
Graham, nods in agreement.
Officer Paski stands up.
OFFICER PASKI
Second thing this week I can't
explain.
GRAHAM
What was the first thing?
OFFICER PASKI
Some animals around the county
exhibiting uncharacteristic
behavior.
Sometimes violent
behavior.
Theo Henry had two of
his fingers bit off by his cow.
GRAHAM
Sounds like a virus.
OFFICER PASKI
No Father, they're edgy.
On alert.
Like they act when they smell a
predator around... Peeing on
themselves and everything.
We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes.
He turns back and
stares in the direction of the house.
You can barely see the
roof over the crops.
Beat.
GRAHAM
(preoccupied)
Edgar, please don't call me Father.
The two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them.
Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face.
OFFICER PASKI
What's wrong?
Beat.
GRAHAM
I don't hear my children.
CUT TO:
BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME
Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred
patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table.
Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and
Officer Paski enter the backyard.
They stop cold when they
look in his direction.
They begin a slow walk towards him.
Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on
his lap.
Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.
Bo is on
top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball.
As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is
crying.
Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE
FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK.
Beat.
They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his
pocket and brings it to his mouth.
He inhales the asthma
spray.
Beat.
He lowers the inhaler so he can speak.
MORGAN
(soft)
He wanted to kill Bo.
Beat.
Graham stares at his ten-year old son.
GRAHAM
Did he hurt you?
Beat.
Morgan nods, "No."
His tough exterior breaks as his
face starts to tremble.
He starts crying.
Graham picks him
up in his arms.
GRAHAM
(whispers in his ear)
I'm so sorry Morgan.
Graham reaches up for Bo.
She has dirt and tears on her
face.
Beat.
She slowly climbs down.
Graham carries both
his children as they cry in his arms.
He starts towards the house.
Merrill walks out from the back
holding a bowl of food.
MERRILL
I used a little Tabasco in the
potato salad.
Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym.
BO
Houdini's sick.
GRAHAM
Please tie up Isabelle to the back
of the shed.
Make sure the knot's
tight.
Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.
He
nods.
The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill
runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the
house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the
shed.
Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen
door.
The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is
the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of
their dead dog's neck.
CUT TO:
HOUSE - NIGHT
The large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight.
A MILLION CRICKETS AND BUGS FILL THE NIGHT AIR WITH SOUND.
THEY SUDDENLY STOP.
AN UNNATURAL SILENCE FILLS THE YARD.
CUT TO:
FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
Merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door.
MERRILL
Okay, this guy is trying to scare
us.
He's messed with our property,
he's coming around the house.
It's
time for an ass whoopin'!
GRAHAM
This is not an intelligent way to
approach this.
Merrill opens the front door.
It's pitch black outside.
Merrill turn to Graham and gestures with his fingers.
MERRILL
(whispering)
We both go outside and move around
the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger.
Make him crap in his pants and
force him around till we meet up on
the other side.
Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle.
GRAHAM
(whispering)
Explain, act crazy?
MERRILL
(whispering)
Curse and stuff.
GRAHAM
(whispering)
I'm not going to curse.
MERRILL
(whispering)
You don't mean it.
It's just for
show.
GRAHAM
(whispering)
It doesn't sound natural when I
curse.
MERRILL
(whispering)
Just make noises then.
GRAHAM
(whispering)
Explain noises.
MERRILL
(whispering)
Are you going to do this or what?
GRAHAM
(whispering)
No I'm not.
MERRILL
(whispering)
You want him coming in the house
next time?
Beat.
They HEAR MOVEMENT OUTSIDE.
Merrill and Graham look out into
the darkness.
MERRILL
(hushed tone)
On the count of three.
(beat)
One... two... three.
Merrill and Graham go out the front door in opposite
directions.
CUT TO:
MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT
Merrill is in a full sprint.
He hugs the side of the
building as he runs.
MERRILL
We're gonna beat your ass bitch!
CUT TO:
GRAHAM'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT
Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of
the house.
He waves his arms.
GRAHAM
Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger.
Graham spots a LARGE FIGURE darting around the corner ahead
of him.
GRAHAM
I've lost my mind!
It's time for
an ass whoopin'!
CUT TO:
MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT
Merrill turns a corner full speed.
THE LARGE FIGURE HAS COME
TO A STOP IN THE SHADOWS AHEAD OF HIM.
HE SEEMS TO BLEND
INTO THE DARKNESS WHEN HE'S STILL.
MERRILL
I'm gonna tear your head off!
Merrill charges.
WE JUST MAKE OUT MOVEMENT IN THE DARKNESS
AS THE FIGURE DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER.
CUT TO:
SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT
Graham and Merrill come screaming around two corners and come
to a stop facing each other.
Beat.
They look around, panting heavily.
GRAHAM
I cursed.
MERRILL
I heard.
Graham's eyes drift above them.
GRAHAM
He's on the roof.
They follow the roof around the corner.
They find themselves
in the backyard.
Their eyes catch movement away from the house.
They just
catch A GLIMPSE OF THE LARGE FIGURE as he disappears into the
crops.
The swing on the swing set is still moving from being
hit.
They stare across the yard silently.
ALL WE HEAR IS THEIR
HEAVY BREATHING.
MERRILL (V.O.)
It was very dark.
GRAHAM (V.O.)
Yes it was.
CUT TO:
PORCH - DAY
Officer Edgar Paski stands on the porch with his note pad
open.
He faces Graham and Merrill.
OFFICER PASKI
You can't describe him at all?
Don't you think that's find of odd?
GRAHAM
It does seem kind of odd doesn't
it?
OFFICER PASKI
I don't know whether to look for a
midget or a --
GRAHAM
He definitely wasn't a midget.
OFFICER PASKI
Okay.
(beat)
So he was tall?
GRAHAM
(to Merrill)
I would say so.
MERRILL
Probably.
OFFICER PASKI
Over six feet?
Beat.
MERRILL
It was very dark.
GRAHAM
Yes, it was.
OFFICER PASKI
We've established that.
(beat)
Just tell me about his clothing
then.
Graham and Merrill stare at Edgar Paski.
OFFICER PASKI
Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or
jeans?
They keep staring.
Edgar closes his pad.
OFFICER PASKI
Let me ask you two something.
Don't be embarrassed by the answer.
It is possible... Just possible
now, you might have been chasing
each other around?
You said you
went in opposite directions.
GRAHAM
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me
saying it, as it is to you hearing
it.
But we couldn't see him.
He
stayed mostly in the shadows.
All
we could make out was movement.
(beat)
But I'll tell you something with
absolute certainty.
There was
someone watching our house last
night.
He was looking in my
children's windows and I want you
to find him Edgar.
(beat)
I need you to take this seriously,
just incase, it is something
serious.
The three men stand in the doorway.
Edgar opens his pad.
OFFICER PASKI
I apologize.
Morgan walks up to the front door.
He holds up a baby
monitor.
MORGAN
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as
a walkie-talkie?
GRAHAM
Yes.
MORGAN
It needs batteries.
GRAHAM
Edgar, come inside.
The three men follow Morgan into the house.
They pass
through the family room where Bo stands at the television.
She is staring at the screen.
ON THE SCREEN IS AERIAL
FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER.
THE FOOTAGE IS OF A LARGE FIELD
WITH ENORMOUS CIRCLES AND DIAMONDS CARVED INTO ITS CROPS.
Bo changes the channel.
She finds a cartoon.
She sits down
on the sofa.
Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the
KITCHEN.
OFFICER PASKI
How certain are you, that this was
a male?
MERRILL
I don't know any girls can run like
that.
Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some
batteries.
He hands them to Morgan.
MORGAN
These are D's; I need double A's.
GRAHAM
I have some upstairs.
Graham starts out of the kitchen.
OFFICER PASKI
I don't know Merrill.
I've seen
some of those women on the
Olympics.
They could out run me
easy.
They all move into the
FAMILY ROOM.
Bo watches cartoons.
THE CARTOON MUSIC AND CARTOON PRAT
FALLS FILLS THE ROOM.
MERRILL
This guy got on the roof in like a
second.
GRAHAM
Bo, can you turn down the volume
until Officer Paski leaves?
Bo nods and moves to the television.
The pack of men follow
Graham up the
STAIRS.
MERRILL
That roof is over ten feet high.
GRAHAM
He's telling you the truth, Edgar.
Whoever it was, is very strong and
can jump pretty high.
They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his
bedroom.
He moves into his
BATHROOM.
They all move in with him.
OFFICER PASKI
They got women's high jumping in
the Olympics.
They got these
Scandinavian women who could jump
clean over me.
Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.
Tries to open
the back.
GRAHAM
Shoot, it needs a screw driver.
I
have double A's in here.
Graham waves the radio.
The men and Morgan move out of the
bathroom.
GRAHAM
I know you're making a point Edgar.
I just don't know what it is.
They moves down the STAIRS.
OFFICER PASKI
Yesterday afternoon, an out of town
woman stopped by the diner and
started yelling and cussing cause
they didn't have her favorite
cigarettes at the vending machine.
Scared a couple of customers.
No
one's seen her since... My point
is, we don't know anything about
the person you saw.
We should just
keep all possibilities available.
They move through the FAMILY ROOM.
Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.
BO
Dad, where's the remote?
Bo starts looking around the couch.
Graham stops before entering the kitchen.
The group stops
with him.
He looks at Bo searching the couch.
He walks over
to the television.
There are three glasses of water on the TV set.
He stands
next to the set.
Doesn't see what's on the screen.
GRAHAM
Bo, you're too old to still be
doing this.
The rule is, you take
a glass of water, you finish it.
(beat)
Now what's wrong with this one?
Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her
father.
Looks at the glass.
BO
There's dust in it.
GRAHAM
This one?
BO
A hair.
GRAHAM
This one?
BO
Morgan took a sip.
It has his
amoebas in it.
Beat.
Bo turns back to her search.
Graham tucks the clock
radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.
He heads
towards the kitchen.
MERRILL
Excluding the possibility that a
female Scandinavian Olympian was
running around outside our house
last night, what else is a
possibility?
OFFICER PASKI
I'm not done asking questions and I
don't appreciate the sarcasm.
They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into
the KITCHEN.
Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other
half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a
screwdriver.
He starts opening the clock radio.
OFFICER PASKI
Do you have anyone who might have a
grudge or something against you?
Maybe a church member, who might
not have liked the fact, that you
left the church?
Graham looks at Edgar.
GRAHAM
I don't think so.
OFFICER PASKI
Do you owe anybody money?
You can
tell me off the record if you need
too.
GRAHAM
No.
MERRILL
No.
Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts
replacing the batteries.
OFFICER PASKI
Is anything missing?
GRAHAM
No.
Graham hands Morgan the monitor.
He turns it ON.
THERE IS A
STATIC CRACKLE WITH SPIKES OF SOUND.
MORGAN
It's still making the noises.
It's
broken.
GRAHAM
It's old Morgan.
Morgan heads out of the kitchen.
MERRILL
Listen, I was out of line with that
whole female Scandinavian Olympian
thing.
Edgar nods.
MERRILL
It's just that, I'm pretty strong
and pretty fast.
And I was running
as fast as I could.
And this
guy...
(embarrassed smile)
He was just toying with us.
Beat.
Merrill walks out of the kitchen.
Graham watches
Edgar think it over.
CUT TO:
HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY
The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car.
OFFICER PASKI
Don't ask me what I think.
Cause I
can't think straight right now.
I'm going back to the station.
Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and
try to think clear.
After that I
might make some calls.
(beat)
Hoaxes... People got way too much
time on their hands.
Edgar turns back to Graham.
OFFICER PASKI
But I'll tell you something, what I
said in their, still goes.
You and
your family have been through a lot
in the last two days... Not to
mention what happened to you all
seven months ago.
GRAHAM
Six months.
Edgar stares at Graham.
GRAHAM
And three weeks.
OFFICER PASKI
It's left its mark still.
The last
thing these children need to do, is
worry about some crazy things
happening in the world.
Take them
into town.
Get their minds -- your
mind, on everyday things.
It's
good medicine.
GRAHAM
It's good advice...
(beat)
Say hi to Marcia for me.
OFFICER PASKI
You take care of yourself...
(beat)
Graham.
CUT TO:
STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON
WE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY.
RURAL
PENNSYLVANIA IN ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL.
TREE LINED STREETS.
WHITE PICKET FENCES.
APPLE ORCHARDS.
The Hess family rides in their station wagon.
Graham drives.
Merrill is shotgun.
The children are in the back.
Morgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO.
RADIO VOICE
... signs intended to be seen from
the sky --
CLICK.
Graham TURNS IT OFF.
GRAHAM
No radio either... Just for a
while.
Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat.
CUT TO:
MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON
Downtown Bucks County.
A group of small stores along a quiet
street.
The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking
meter.
Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around.
Merrill
puts change in the meter.
Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo.
MORGAN
Book money.
Morgan holds out his hand.
Graham gives his son a look as he
reaches into his back pocket.
GRAHAM
Only one.
Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand
and walks down the sidewalk.
Graham watches them turn into a store.
Merrill steps onto the sidewalk.
Hands in his pockets as he
walks away.
Graham turns and calls after him.
GRAHAM
(calls out)
Meet back in fifteen minutes.
Merrill waves over his shoulder.
He keeps walking.
Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy.
CUT TO:
STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON
Merrill, Morgan and Bo are waiting in the parked car.
Beat.
The driver's side opens and Graham sits in.
MERRILL
Pharmacy crowded?
GRAHAM
I don't want any one of you
spending time with Tracey Abernathy
alone.
Is that understood?
Beat.
Everyone nods, "yes."
Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on.
Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in
reverse -- and then stops.
Graham is staring out the windshield.
Merrill follows his
stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET
coming out of a store.
Merrill's face changes expression
too.
They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.
MORGAN
(soft)
Is that him?
MERRILL
(soft)
Yeah.
Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as
he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck.
It's here that
he notices the stares.
He glances up to see the faces
watching him from the station wagon.
The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck.
He gets
in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station
wagon, backs out of the parking lot.
Beat.
The Hess family sits quietly.
BO
Who is he?
Nobody says anything for the longest time.
MORGAN
He's the man who killed mom.
Graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into
the street.
CUT TO:
HESS HOME - AFTERNOON
THE SKY IS GOLDEN RED.
The crops sway hypnotically in a
gentle breeze.
The Hess station wagon pulls into their driveway.
It comes
to a stop in front of the house.
The engine goes off.
No
one gets out.
CUT TO:
BACKYARD - EVENING
WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE.
The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen.
We see Graham, Merrill and
the children doing dishes after dinner.
The DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.
OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS.
Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post
outside the barn.
The dog whips back and forth frantically.
She keeps looking in our direction.
WE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN.
WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE
HOUSE.
Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of
dog food and a bowl of water.
We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog.
When he
gets close, Graham slows.
He approaches the dog carefully.
He places the two bowls close but not too close.
The dog has
no interest in them.
She keeps barking and glaring in our
direction.
Graham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND
LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.
WE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.
CUT TO:
BARN - EVENING
Graham stands frozen looking across his yard.
Isabelle, the
dog turns in desperate circles behind him.
Graham's eyes
stay focused on the same point in the darkness.
He talks to
no one.
GRAHAM
You know something?
Even
entertaining the possibility of
this for a minute has been
exciting.
Beat.
Graham starts to move.
GRAHAM
I can see how people can get
carried away with this type of
thing.
Graham reaches the barbecue area.
There's a flashlight on
the picnic table.
Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.
A NARROW
BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.
Graham starts toward the crops.
GRAHAM
It's a kind of faith.
It's an
intoxicating thing to believe in
something you can't see.
THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE
BACKYARD.
Graham steps right up to them.
He hesitates and
then steps into the field of
CORN CROPS.
We can't see two feet in any direction.
Six foot stalks of
corn line Graham on all sides.
THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A
WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.
GRAHAM
You were always good at that...
THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.
Graham
starts following it.
His shoulders brush crops on either
side.
GRAHAM
Believing in things you couldn't
see.
(beat)
You would have been the first
person on that station wagon
wouldn't you?
You and Morgan would
have been wrestling for that baby
monitor.
SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.
Graham stops.
HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.
Nothing
but crops disappearing into darkness.
GRAHAM
It'll be secretly kind of sad for
everybody, when this turns out to
be -- all just make believe.
THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.
Graham spins and aims
the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.
THE LIGHT ONLY
PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.
GRAHAM
(yelling)
You're wasting your time here!
I'm
not going to report this or
anything you do to me crops, to the
news or TV or anybody!
You're not
going to get famous!
Beat.
There is no response.
GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN
BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF
HIM.
Beat.
Graham holds his breath.
THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE
BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.
Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.
THE
BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.
GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.
HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
BREATHING.
BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
HIS OWN BREATHING IS
FAST AND LOUD NOW.
Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.
His hands
search over the ground in all directions.
They finally touch
the flashlight.
Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the
"on" button.
He does.
A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.
SOMETHING POWDERY
WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.
It instantly moves into the darkness.
Graham tries to get
up.
He stumbles backwards into the crops.
He's tangled in
crops as he struggles to rise.
He gets up and starts
running.
Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions.
He panics.
He doesn't know where he is.
THERE IS SOMETHING COMING
BEHIND HIM.
Graham makes a sudden right turn.
He puts his hands in front
of him to protect his face and eyes.
He's running as fast as
he can.
HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.
Another sudden turn, this time left.
Graham emerges into his
BACKYARD.
Graham keeps running across the yard.
ISABELLE BARKS
FRANTICALLY.
When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.
There is no one behind him.
The wall of crops fifty feet
away sway in the gentle night breeze.
Graham gains control of his breathing.
He turns and walks to
the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.
CUT TO:
REDDY HOUSE - DAY
A mailbox reads "R. Reddy."
There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter
mile driveway.
We saw the roof of this house from the Hess
hallway window.
Graham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.
Beat.
Graham tries to look inside.
Curtains block his view.
Graham walks around the porch.
Turns the corner of the
house.
He looks in a side window.
THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN.
THE KITCHEN
CHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.
THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS
UPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR.
THE ROOM IS
TOTALLY WRECKED.
Graham stands straight up.
He looks around nervously.
He
takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the
safety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK
parked to the side of the house.
There is someone sitting in it.
CUT TO:
REDDY DRIVEWAY - DAY
The passenger side window of the truck is open.
Graham steps
up to it and looks inside.
The thin man with the leather
jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel.
He stares out
the windshield.
He is covered in sweat.
GRAHAM
Hello Ray.
RAY REDDY doesn't look over.
Doesn't react.
Keeps staring.
Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles
a yellow white.
Graham glances to the backseat of the truck.
There are two
large bags over flowing with clothes.
Graham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the
TWO BLOOD STAINED AREA ON HIS SHIRT.
Beat.
GRAHAM
What happened Ray?
Beat.
Ray doesn't look over when he speaks.
RAY
I wrote your number down to call
you.
It's been sitting next to the
phone for six months.
When I knew
it was inside the house, I couldn't
think of any other number to call.
I panicked.
(beat)
Thank you for coming Father.
GRAHAM
(soft)
You're welcome Ray.
Tears start falling down Ray's face.
RAY
I worked so long that night.
I
ain't never fallen asleep driving
before.
And never since.
Most of
the ride home, there wasn't a car
insight in either direction.
If
I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended
up in a ditch with a head ache.
It
had to happen at that right moment.
That certain ten-fifteen seconds
when I passed her walking.
It was
like it was meant to be.
Ray finally turns.
His red face quivers as he talks.
RAY
I guess if this is the end of the
world, I'm screwed right?
People
who kill Reverends' wives aren't
exactly ushered to the front of the
line in heaven.
Ray starts the car.
GRAHAM
Where you going Ray?
RAY
To the lake.
The way I see it, all
the places marked in the crops and
such -- none of them are really
near water.
I figure they don't
like water.
(beat)
Can't be any worse than here.
Beat.
GRAHAM
Ray, did you see one of them?
Ray looks at Graham.
RAY
I'm truly sorry for what I've done
to you and yours.
The two men stare at each other for a beat.
Ray looks away.
He puts the car in drive.
RAY
And don't open my pantry Father.
I
locked one of them in there.
Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down
the driveway.
CUT TO:
STATION WAGON - DAY
The station wagon knocks over the "Ray Reddy" mailbox as it
turns sharply onto the road.
Graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his
right.
THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.
Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon
comes to a fast stop.
Beat.
Graham gets out of the car.
He walks a few feet ahead
of the station wagon.
He bends down in the middle of the
road.
A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.
Its head is crushed.
Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers.
Beat.
Graham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY
above him.
GRAHAM
(soft)
Douche bag.
CUT TO:
HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON
WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.
We see Graham
inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room
after another.
WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.
OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.
She is
not pacing.
She is not barking.
She sits staring right at
us.
She is shivering.
OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill
carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs.
He's moving into the main house.
Merrill walks across the yard.
His eyes look around
carefully as he moves.
Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses
the lawn.
He stops walking and starts to gather up the
fallen things.
He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs
encased in glass cases.
The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has
cracked.
He takes the ball out.
Stares at it.
We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of
clothes and things on the grass.
He looks around and finds
what he's looking for.
A rake.
Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle.
With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball
in the other, he turns to face the crops.
WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.
PART OF OUR VIEW IS
OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.
Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a
batter's stance.
His left leg digs into the grass in front
of him.
His weight is mostly on his back leg.
He looks out
into the distance high over the crops.
He throws the
baseball up in the air...
Merrill grabs the wooden handle.
Merrill's shoulders move
with blinding speed.
The wooden rake handle slices the air.
And misses the ball.
The ball drops at Merrill's feet.
WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.
This
time his shoulders move even faster.
The wooden stick
actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.
The ball drops at Merrill's feet.
WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up
and tries a third time.
This time he YELLS as he swings.
He
rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the
eye.
The baseball drops at his feet.
Strike three.
Merrill stands still in the yard.
He's breathing a little
heavy as he stares down at the ball.
He gently picks it up.
He walks back to his pile of things
and then suddenly turns.
He throws the ball in the air as he
does.
His left leg goes out.
His weight goes to his right
leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and
power...
THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS
ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.
The ball rockets into the air.
We watch it fly overhead...
sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.
After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.
It
lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.
It
cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.
Maybe
more.
WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.
He drops
the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.
He
piles them in his arms.
When his arms are full, he starts
for the porch.
WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES
INSIDE THE HOUSE.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT
WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.
THE LIGHT IS MOVING.
WE
REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD.
The car door opens.
Graham Hess steps out.
His coat is
open.
He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.
A
priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black
shirt.
Graham looks around in a daze.
We are on a country road.
THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE
LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.
Four police cars are scattered
amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.
A large group of officers and workers hover around a green
truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.
Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.
He whispers
something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he
approaches.
Edgar looks badly shaken.
Beat.
The two men
look at each other.
OFFICER PASKI
What do you know?
Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides.
Beat.
GRAHAM
There was an accident.
Drunk
driving.
They weren't sure.
OFFICER PASKI
He wasn't drinking.
Ray fell
asleep at the wheel.
Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the
ambulances.
Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass.
His
arms rest on his bent knees.
GRAHAM
Is he okay?
OFFICER PASKI
Yes... That's the first thing
Colleen asked too.
Graham smiles a little smile.
GRAHAM
She's talking... Which ambulance is
she in?
Beat.
OFFICER PASKI
She's not in an ambulance Father.
GRAHAM
Why not?
OFFICER PASKI
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off
the road and ah... Hit Colleen and
then a tree.
She was pinned
between the two.
GRAHAM
Pinned?
What does that mean?
Beat.
OFFICER PASKI
The truck... the truck has severed
most of her lower half.
GRAHAM
What did you say?
Beat.
OFFICER PASKI
She won't be saved.
At this point
she's alive, because the truck is
holding her together.
She doesn't
feel much, and she's talking almost
like normal.
We didn't pull the
truck out, cause we wanted you to
come down here to be with her, as
long as she's awake.
That won't be
very long.
(beat)
Father, you understand what I've
told you?
Beat.
GRAHAM
Edgar.
(he starts crying)
Is this the last time I'm going to
talk to my wife?
Beat.
OFFICER PASKI
Yes it is.
CUT TO:
STREET - NIGHT
The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them.
He
walks on, unaware of the stares.
He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck.
It
sticks out onto the road a few feet.
He comes around the
side of the vehicle.
COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way.
Her straight
brown hair falls down over her small face.
She leans over
the front bumper of the truck onto the hood.
Her head rests
on her arms like a child resting on a school desk.
Her back
is against a tree.
The lower half of her is obscured by the
truck.
She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up
to her.
She is shivering slightly.
COLLEEN
(soft)
Hi sweetie.
GRAHAM
Hi baby.
Graham glances down.
There are bundles of blood soaked
blankets in the area below her.
They peek out under the
twisted front of the truck.
Graham looks up quickly.
COLLEEN
I was just taking a walk before
dinner.
GRAHAM
You love walks.
Beat.
COLLEEN
I guess it was meant to be.
Beat.
GRAHAM
Does it hurt?
COLLEEN
I don't feel much.
GRAHAM
Good.
Graham touches her cheek.
She starts crying.
Graham starts
crying with her.
COLLEEN
(crying)
... Tell Morgan to play games --
it's okay to be silly.
GRAHAM
(crying)
... I will.
COLLEEN
(crying)
... Tell Bo to listen to her
brother.
He'll always take care of
her.
GRAHAM
(crying)
... I will.
COLLEEN
(crying)
... Tell Graham --
GRAHAM
(crying)
I'm here.
COLLEEN
(crying)
Tell him... See.
Tell him to see.
Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.
She rests
on it.
Her eyes are distant.
COLLEEN
(soft)
And tell Merrill to swing away.
GRAHAM
(soft)
What?
(beat)
Colleen?... Colleen?
WE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE.
CUT TO:
BACKYARD - MORNING
Merrill and Bo find Graham kneeling in the grass.
Morgan
lays limp in his arms.
They kneel down in the grass with
him.
Merrill sees the empty syringe in Graham's hand.
He looks to
Morgan.
The boy's head is tilted back.
His tiny mouth hangs
open unnaturally.
GRAHAM
His lungs were closed.
(beat)
His lungs were closed.
No poison
got in... No poison got in.
Merrill stares at Morgan.
His body is utterly still.
GRAHAM
His lungs were closed.
Merrill reaches for Morgan's still hand.
GRAHAM
Don't touch him.
MERRILL
(soft)
Graham.
Beat.
Morgan lies lifeless.
BO
Daddy.
GRAHAM
Don't touch him.
Bo is crying.
MERRILL
Graham.
GRAHAM
Don't.
Beat.
MORGAN'S VOICE
Dad.
HIS SON'S VOICE MAKES HIM STOP.
Graham starts crying.
Every
bit of sadness trapped in his body is released.
He looks
down through tears and tears at Morgan.
MORGAN
Did someone save me?
GRAHAM
Yeah baby.
I think someone did.
