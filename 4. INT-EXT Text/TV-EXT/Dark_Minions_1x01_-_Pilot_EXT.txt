      It s quiet and peaceful -- the curve of KAVNICIA, a 
        luminous pink planet, fills the lower half of the frame.

      An enormous and sinister ship breaks into frame, with 
        appropriate SCARY music accompanying it. This is the GCS 
        EIGHT -- the Galactic Conglomerate Spaceport.



        Wreckage from the failed invasion is strewn about. Mel 
        and Andy materialize from thin air.

                                        MEL
                      You okay?

        Andy, hunched over, looks like he may vomit.

                                        ANDY
                      Yeah. Yup. Just need a sec.

                                        MEL
                      Wow. You teleport worse than anybody I ve 
                      ever met.

                                        ANDY
                      I used to get sick in the back seat of 
                      cars. Getting my atoms shot across space 
                      is a perfect storm for esophageal reflux.

                                        MEL
                      You gonna hurl?

                                        ANDY
                      Wait. Can t talk... (THEN) Okay I m good.

      He stands up. And hurls. On Mel s shoes.



      Andy is holding up a piece of debris, scavenged from the 
        battlefield.

                                        ANDY
                      Hey, look at this thing.

                                        MEL
                      Looks like one of ours. Better log it and 
                      fill out the appropriate forms.

                                        ANDY
                      Sounds like a lot of work. I have a 
                      better idea.

      He punts it like a football.

                                        ANDY (CONT D)
                      Two points! ... Wanna smoke a bowl?

                                        MEL
                      Are you out of your mind?! We re on 
                      official GCS business.

                                        ANDY
                      It s good shit. From planet Kathoobatine.

                                        MEL
                      No thanks. Last time I smoked that stuff 
                      I slept with a lizard creature.

                                        ANDY
                      How was that?

                                        MEL
                      The sex was great. The alimony is killing 
                      me.

        Suddenly a camouflage-clad Freedom Fighter jumps out from 
        behind some junk. She s got a laser gun pointed right at 
        our guys... she s CARLY... and she s beautiful.

                                        CARLY
                      One move and I ll turn you both into 
                      stains!      Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    11.



      Andy chucks his stash.

                                        ANDY
                      Nothing - what - it s prescription!

        Mel is pretty smitten by Carly, who is not about to drop 
        the laser gun anytime soon.

                                        CARLY
                      You guys are with the GC?

                                        MEL
                      GC! Us?! Like we would ever work for 
                      those evil, uh, guys. No, no... We... 
                      we re just... rummaging. We re antiques 
                      dealers!

      He nudges Andy.

                                        ANDY
                      Just rummaging. We like to rummage.

                                        MEL
                      We found these uniforms on some of the 
                      scum that invaded this sovereign planet. 
                      And they happened to fit. Perfectly.

                                        CARLY
                      I don t believe you.

                                        MEL
                      Look, if we were bad guys, wouldn t we 
                      have weapons? 

                                        ANDY
                      Exactly. No lasers. No plasma guns. All 
                      we got are these crap clipboards. 

                                        CARLY
                                (letting down her guard)
                      They usually send a recon mission down, 
                      especially after a defeat.

                                        ANDY
                      Well, they wouldn t find anything. 
                      Wreckage. Couple dead bodies.

      He gestures blandly at a corpse nearby. Carly goes over -- 
        gun still trained at our heroes. And she kicks the corpse 
      in the head. We can t see it, but it sounds like a foot 
        going through a canteloupe. Mel and Andy react 
        accordingly.      Dark Minions 01.01, Revisions Draft (Pink) 1-09-2013    12.



                                        CARLY
                      That s what I d like to do to all of the 
                      pawns of the GC.

                                        MEL
                      Heh. Yeah, us too.

                                          ACT TWO



        For a moment, the GCS spaceport floats silently above 
        Kavnicia. Then, the giant, unnamed super weapon lights up 
        and... blares DEATH METAL at the planet. Only a super 
        weapon could be so obnoxiously loud.
