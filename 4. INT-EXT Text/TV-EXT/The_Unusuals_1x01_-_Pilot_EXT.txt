      A windy desolate area near the Lincoln Tunnel.  A HOOKER in a 
      little black dress stands by the side of the road.  This is 
      DETECTIVE CASEY SHRAEGER, 28. She's the kind of smart, 
      together cop a criminal doesn't mind being caught by, as long 
      as they get to wrestle a little bit.  Other hookers are 
      visible in the distance.

                                  CASEY
                          (to herself)
                    Let me get this straight.  A man 
                    works a long day.  He comes home, 
                    kisses his wife, pats his son on 
                    the head.  After dinner he says I 
                    forgot something at the office.  He 
                    gets in his car, drives to an empty 
                    stretch of road and pays a stranger 
                    to have sex with him.  Am I the 
                    only one who thinks that s weird?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Walsh heads for his car.  Casey hurries after him.

                                  CASEY
                    I m sorry about Kowalski.

      Walsh climbs into the driver s side of a Ford four-door.  
      Casey gets in the passenger side.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The corner of Pitt Street and Grand.  We see street traffic, 
      patrol cars pulling out.

      TITLE CARD: TUESDAY

      SFX: We hear the sound of a man and woman screwing.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Walsh and Casey stand on a pedestrian overpass, looking down 
      at the crime scene.  A grassy area near the river, roped off 
      with yellow police tape.  CSU crews are working.  News vans 
      on the grass.

                                  CASEY
                    We re missing the autopsy.

      Walsh doesn t answer.  He studies the scene below.

                                  WALSH
                    No car.  He would have had to walk 
                    or take a cab.  There d be a record 
                    of that.  Also, no trees around the 
                    body.  Kowalski would have seen his 
                    attacker coming.

                                  CASEY
                    You don t want to go down there?

      Walsh shakes his head.  He prefers the big picture view.  

                                  CASEY (cont'd)
                    I ll call CSU, see what they ve 
                    turned up.

                                  WALSH
                    Here s the rule.  In a case with no 
                    obvious suspects the crime lab will 
                    produce no valuable evidence.  If 
                    we had two eyewitnesses and a full 
                      confession, CSU would cough up 
                      print-hits, fiber-evidence and a 
                      ballistics match.  That s the way 
                    it works. 

                                  CASEY 
                    What I don t understand?  Why does 
                    a woman like Hannah marry a guy 
                    like Kowalski?  She s smart, 
                    pretty.  She knew he was cheating.  
                    How could she stay?                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley19.


                                  WALSH
                    You think we fall in love with 
                    people because of their strengths?  
                    It s the skeletons.  Wait ten 
                    years.  You ll see.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Banks and Delahoy exit the Councilman s building.  

                                  BANKS
                    A cat?  A goddamn cat? Well, now we 
                    know where we stand.  We re the 
                    mopes you send to empty the litter 
                    box.

      As they walk, we start to notice several MISSING CAT FLIERS 
      stuck to mailboxes and lampposts. 

                                  BANKS (cont'd)
                    Am I crazy?  A cop was killed.  Our 
                    brother officer. 

      Delahoy isn t listening.  The Vicodin is starting to work, 
      and he has other things on his mind.                     The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley21.


                                  BANKS (cont'd)
                    ... and they have us running 
                      errands...

      Delahoy s cell phone rings.  He answers it, still walking.

                                    DELAHOY
                    Delahoy.

                                  DR. KAISER (O.S.)
                    It s Dr. Kaiser.  Don t hang up. 

      Delahoy hangs up, pockets the phone.  He realizes he s lost 
      Banks, turns.  Banks is staring up at the missing cat fliers.

                                  BANKS 
                    That s a lot of cats.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A SERIES OF SHOTS from around the neighborhood.  Banks and 
      Delahoy go door to door, missing cat posters in hand, talking 
      to their owners.  One OWNER hands Banks a black plastic 
      garbage bag, inside is the remains of her cat.  Banks opens 
      their car s trunk, throws the plastic garbage bag inside.  We 
      see other garbage bags in there.  It s a goddamn mess.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Delahoy and Banks get out of their car and approach an alley.  
      They see a WELL-DRESSED WHITE MAN who has corned a CAT near a 
      dumpster.  He s trying to coax it into a duffel bag.

                                    DELAHOY
                    Freeze!

      The man TAKES OFF.  Banks and Delahoy go after him.  The man 
      RUNS across the street.  The detectives give chase, Delahoy 
      quickly pulling ahead of Banks.  The man DUCKS into the...

      SUBWAY

      Delahoy follows.  The man JUMPS a turnstile.  Delahoy goes 
      after him.  The man reaches the platform.  A train is coming.  
      Instead of stopping he JUMPS ONTO THE TRACKS.  The train 
      brakes with a screech.

      The man doesn t stop.  He JUMPS over the third rail, running 
      toward the far platform.  Delahoy jumps onto the tracks 
      behind him, lands hard. The train is almost on top of him, 
      brakes screeching.  Delahoy turns to face it, the lights 
      blinding him.  Instead of trying to get out of the way, he 
        straightens, opening his arms.  This will be a good death.

      The subway STOPS inches from his face.  Delahoy can t believe 
      it.  Meanwhile, the man is up on the far platform and racing 
      toward the exit.  But then HE IS CLOTHES-LINED BY BANKS, who 
      has circled to the far entrance and cut him off.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Alvarez is in the middle of nowhere Queens, standing in front 
      of vacant lot, fuming.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    That address you gave me is an 
                    empty field.

                                  WALSH
                    I was just gonna call you.  The CI 
                    reached out again.  He messed up 
                    the address.  He s in a White 
                    Castle on Rockaway Boulevard.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    Are you screwing with me?

                                  WALSH
                    He told me he saw Kowalski right 
                    before the murder.  Three black 
                    kids follow him into the park.  
                    Says he knows one of them.

                                    ALVAREZ
                          (beat)
                    Rockaway Boulevard?

                                  WALSH
                    Yup.

      Walsh hangs up.  

                                  CASEY
                    You re an evil man.

      They reach number 314.  There s a LOCK lying broken on the 
      floor.  Walsh and Casey pull their guns.  Walsh reaches down 
      and rolls up the gate.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Walsh is driving, Casey beside him.

                                  CASEY
                    If Kowalski was keeping files on 
                    cops, maybe a cop killed him.

                                  WALSH
                    Until we know more we don t say a 
                    word.

      Casey s phone rings.  She answers.

      Off Casey:  Shit.  She sneaks a look at Walsh.

                                  CASEY
                    I can t help you with that.  I m in 
                    the middle of something.

      Casey covers the phone.  She really doesn t want to do this.

                          (to Walsh)

                    more than an hour.  Cover for me?

      Casey looks over at a black SUV.  There is a UNIFORMED 
      OFFICER driving.  A grey-haired man sits in back.  This is 
      LIEUTENANT LITTLE.

                                    LIEUTENANT LITTLE
                    I m Lieutenant Little.  Get in.

      The alley behind the station.  A squad car is parked outside.

      TITLE: WEDNESDAY

      Banks and Delahoy lead Harold Snaith out back.

                                  BANKS
                          (to Delahoy)
                    You think Beaumont and the Sarge...

                                    DELAHOY
                    Uncle Beaumont?  Does she even have 
                    the right equipment?

                                  HAROLD
                    Where are you taking me?

                                  BANKS
                    No place.  We just want to talk.

                                  HAROLD
                    I told you, I have nothing more to 
                    say.

      Delahoy pushes Harold against a squad car, uncuffs him.

                                  HAROLD (cont'd)
                    Are you going to hit me?

      Delahoy starts rolling up his sleeves.  

                                    DELAHOY
                    We know you killed those cats, 
                    Harold.  We re not going back 
                    inside until you confess.

                                  HAROLD
                    If you touch me, I ll sue.  I 
                    swear.                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley48.


      Delahoy cocks his arm.  Unnoticed, Banks takes a bottle of 
      fish sauce out of his pocket.  He squirts it all over Harold.

                                  HAROLD (cont'd)
                    Oh!  What are you...

                                  BANKS
                    Just a little seasoning.  Eric.

      Delahoy opens the back of a SQUAD CAR.  He shoves Harold 
      inside, closes the door.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The detectives arrive with a TACTICAL TEAM.  Walsh sends COPS 
      around to the back.  The others approach the front door.

                                                                            CUT TO:                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley57.



      The aftermath.  Emergency personnel are there.  Casey and 
      Walsh are on the street.

                                  WALSH
                    You sure you re okay?

                                  CASEY
                    Stop treating me like a girl.  I m 
                    fine.

      But she takes his jacket when he slips it over her shoulders.  
      Beaumont exits the building, holding up a zip-lock bag.

                                  BEAUMONT
                      Kowalski s badge and gun.  They 
                    were hidden behind the stove.

      Walsh goes over to her.  Casey turns away.  We can tell she s 
      not fine at all.  

                                                                            CUT TO:
