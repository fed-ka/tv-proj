  who looks bored and exhausted (hair unkempt, baggy eyes, etc.)

    CYRIL, also looking exhausted, comes in with a bunch of FILES.

                    Or me!  I have to re-do the annual
                    budget because she's blowing it all

                    Well his plane did crash, and the
                    distress signal was last heard coming
                    from a known pirate fortress, so...

                                      CYRIL
                    So?!  That doesn't mean Ray and Lana

                    Wasted, exactly, let's go be that! 
                    C'mon, happy hour at Pita Margarita's!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Is... that what it sounds like?

                                    PAM
                    Only if it sounds like a shitload of

    MALORY, also looking exhausted, and sloshing a large HIGHBALL
    around, lurches out of her office and stands in the doorway.

  As we PAN from the open balcony doors overlooking the Pacific
    ocean, across the things you'd expect to see in a pirate
    captain's quarters (old table covered with CHARTS, a TELESCOPE,
  RUM, a GLOBE, and quite possibly even a PARROT) we hear Archer.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    Ohhhh my God, stop, stop, stop,
                    seriously I can't take anymore!

  The PAN brings us to Archer, lying nude in a big old four-poster
  bed, holding a fifth of RUM and covered with two gorgeous nude
    NATIVE WOMEN (with sheets, etc. covering all the X-rated parts). 
    There's fruit and goop smeared around, ping-pong paddle, etc.

                                      ARCHER
                          (laughing)
                    Whew!  That was insane, I never even
                    heard of that position!  Did the
                      missionaries not swing by here, or...?

  KNOCK KNOCK!  We hear a knock and the heavy door creaks open.

                                    NOAH (O.S.)
                    Excuse me?  Sorry, pirate-king Archer?

                                      ARCHER
                    What!  Noah!

  NOAH stands by the door with a CLIPBOARD, pushes up his GLASSES.

                                    NOAH
                    Ready for the uh, morning briefing?                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     5

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah, I'm half drunk and slathered
                    in... every bodily fluid there is.
                          (swigs rum)
                    So yeah, this is about as pirate-
                    kingy as I'm gonna get.  Brief away!

                                    NOAH

                                      ARCHER
                    Good morning.

    Archer flashes that shit-eating grin a beat, then we CUT TO the


  MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     6

                                        ACT ONE



    Archer, in chinos and open Aloha shirt, looks out the balcony
    doors, distractedly tossing/catching a COCONUT with a FISH NET
    (i.e., lacrosse style).  Noah stands nearby with the CLIPBOARD.

                                    NOAH
                    Well --

                    C'mon, karaoke night's a big hit...

10FLASHBACK: KARAOKE NIGHT -- NIGHT

  On a makeshift bamboo stage lit with TIKI TORCHES, a slightly
    bucktoothed pirate, BUCKY, croons a weird Malay song...

                                      PIRATE
                    Roti dan mentega, bakar dan selai!

  Until Archer staggers onstage with RUM, his arm thrown over a
    native girl, and shoves him offstage as he grabs the MICROPHONE.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!

11FLASHBACK: FEAST -- NIGHT

    Sullen pirates sit on log stumps and crappy chairs around a 
    bonfire, attended by hot NATIVE GIRLS with big PLATTERS.  

                                      ARCHER (V.O.)
                    We have an awesome feast every night...

    Archer staggers into the foreground with RUM, his arm over a
    native girl, and smacks the PLATE right out of a pirate's hands.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     7

12FLASHBACK: INTRAMURAL LACROSSE -- DAY

  On a makeshift lacrosse field (bamboo goal with fishnet, COCONUT
    "ball" etc.), Archer totally pwns the other pirates (who use
  FISH NETS as sticks but somehow have sleeveless mesh JERSEYS)

                                      ARCHER (V.O.)
                    Not to mention intramural lacrosse!

  1) SWOOSH!  WHUMP!  Archer scores a goal and then cross-checks
  the GOALIE in the chest, knocking him down and out of frame.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!

  2) KRUNCH!  Archer decimates a (much smaller) pirate with a
    flying cross-body check as the other pirates look on sullenly.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!

  3) Archer bobs up and down, his NET/STICK held over his head.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!

  We PULL OUT to see he's "HALO-bagging" another pirate, whom
  (one assumes) he has just knocked both down and totally out.

                                      ARCHER (V.O.)
                    So how can they have low morale?


                                    NOAH
                    Well um, besides all of those things,
                    they haven't been paid.

                                      ARCHER
                    So pay 'em, what do you need, new
                    payroll software?  Cyril always
                    handled all that stuff.  Payroll,
                    budgets, he's a genius at that crap...


    Cyril, tie loose, looking crazy, a half-empty bottle of BOURBON
  and a ROCKS GLASS on his desk, types furiously on his KEYBOARD.

                                      CYRIL
                          (mocking Malory)
                    Just find the money, Cyril!  You're
                    an accounting genius, Cyril!

                          (normal)
                    That's right you hawk-faced harpy...

  ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

    Crazy.  Numbers scrolling up, down, sideways.  All Matrix-y. 
  The "how" TBD, but the upshot is Cyril is dumping money from
  ISIS into dozens of money-laundering accounts, then into Swiss
    accounts.  We see his crazy-eyed reflection on the screen.

                                      CYRIL
                    I am an accounting genius!  So good
                    luck finding all these Swiss accounts!
                          (maniacal laughter)
                    Mwah ha!  Mwah ha ha ha ha haaaaaa!

                                    PAM (O.S.)
                    Whatcha doin?

                                      CYRIL
                    Aagh!

    Cyril's shocked reflection turns toward the door, and we CUT
  TO see Pam standing there drunk, coat on, holding a big 32-oz.
    GO-CUP and a carpet-dripping FALAFEL PITA from Pita Margarita's.

                                      CYRIL
                    Hey, Pam...

                    Oh!  And dealing with disgruntled
                      employees, Pam's great at that...


  Pam moves unsteadily toward Cyril's desk, dripping yogurt sauce.

                                    PAM
                    Izzat innernet porn?

                    It's... kinda weird.                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     9

                    Is it?

  Beat.

                                      CYRIL
                    Yes?

  And as Pam takes another slurpy drag on her straw we CUT TO


    Archer is now distractedly feeding PEANUTS to the PARROT.

                    I think it's because she's such a

19FLASHBACK: FIRST BOARDING -- TUNA BOAT DECK -- CONTINUOUS

  Waist up on Archer as he frog-marches a Malaysian guy on deck,
  one hand on the guys's collar, his COLT .45 in the guy's cheek.

                    Dammit, I said get over there!

    Archer shoves him off-screen and we CUT WIDE to see the deck is
    stacked with big, freshly caught TUNA.  Archer has shoved the
  guy (who turns out is a pirate) toward Noah and the rest of his
    (armed, sullen) pirate crew.  He now stands between them and
  the CAPTAIN and CREW of the tuna boat, all with hands up.

                                      ARCHER
                    For the jillionth time, nobody is
                    raping anybody!  Actually no, you
                    know what?!  Now nobody gets anything,
                    because I'm letting him go!

                      [ad-libbed pissed-offness at this]

                                      ARCHER
                    Shut up!  He's a small business owner!
                    If he loses his ship he'll be ruined!
                          (to tuna captain)
                    You can go.  Ooh, but can we get
                    about fifty pounds of tuna steaks?


                                    NOAH
                    Which you let him talk you down to
                    twenty.

                                      ARCHER
                    Well?!  You know what kinda margins
                    those guys work on?

                                    NOAH
                      I actually don't...

                                      ARCHER
                    Well nice Ph.D.!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     11

                                    NOAH
                    My field's anthropology.  And I'm 
                    actually just a doctoral candidate? 
                    Or I was, until these guys captured
                    my research vessel and enslaved me...

                                      ARCHER
                    Ugh, not this again...

                                    NOAH
                    So I was thinking, if you freed me...

                                      ARCHER
                    You're my translator, I need you. 
                    That's why I made you first mate.

                                    NOAH
                    Which also went over pretty badly.  

                                      ARCHER
                    Yeah, so let's just put a pin in the
                    whole... manumission thing.

                                    NOAH
                    But --

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah!  Morale's low enough as it is.
                          (small gasp)
                    And I bet I know who's to blame!

                                    NOAH

  RILEY leans his forearms through the bars of his cell, talking
  to BUCKY, the HALO-bagged pirate, who sits outside the cell on
    a stool, lazily wiping his AK-47 with a RAG.  The floor of
    Riley's cell is covered with dirty straw, and the only other
  items in it are a thin BLANKET and a crusty, fly-buzzing BUCKET.

                                      RILEY
                    I'm not kidding, this Archer guy's
                    gonna get you all killed.  He --

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    Riley!

    Archer storms up with Noah on his heels.  Bucky glares
    malevolently at Archer as he wipes his AK-47 with the RAG.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     12

                                      RILEY
                    Archer, what a coincidence.  I was
                    just talking about you.

                                      ARCHER
                    With who?  Cause that bucktooth little
                    shit doesn't even speak English!

                                      BUCKY
                    I do little bit --

                                      ARCHER
                    No you don't.

                                      BUCKY
                    -- and correct syntax is "with whom!"

  Bucky leaps up and flip-flops away, down the dank corridor.

                                    NOAH
                    Man, that is not gonna help morale.

                                      RILEY
                    Yeah, Bucky's an incorrigible gossip.

                                      ARCHER
                    Who -- to whom you are forbidden to
                    speak!  I locked you down here so 
                    you couldn't contact my mother, not
                    so you could, whatever, sow disharmony!

                                      RILEY
                    You're sowing plenty all by yourself. 
                    Face it kid, you're a bust as a pirate-
                    king.

                                      ARCHER
                    King, exactly!  And unless you want
                    to spend the rest of the afternoon
                    with a bunch of scorpions, don't
                    forget it!


    Malory leans (OTS, butt on) her desk with a HIGHBALL.  On her
    monitor, a "DASH-CAM" SHOT of Lana steering the yacht is inset
  on a GFX MAP of Pacific, with a green DOT moving toward PANGU.

                    I'm sure you'd love it if Sterling

                    Wh-?  No I wouldn't!

                     -- but just try to control all your
                    jealousy and, ick, sexual frustration.

  Lana stares at camera a long beat, then reaches toward it...

                                    LANA
                    Oh no, you're breaking up.

    ZZZRPT!  Lana turns off her camera, the inset goes to STATIC.

  Lana stands and steers as Ray leans (butt on) the console next
  her facing aft, stirring his FRUITY DRINK with a CRAZY STRAW.

                                    LANA
                    I mean, am I jealous because Archer
                    gets preferential treatment?  Yes. 
                    But am I still attracted to him?

                    He asked, pretty sarcastically.

    Gillette, now in tactical attire (and watch cap), stands nearby
  as Manu puts CAMO MAKE-UP on him using CAMO GREASEPAINT STICKS.

  CUT TO Lana, peering through BINOCULARS as she steers.

                    Yeah, right?
                          (writing)
                    Gonna go ahead and change "morale
                    problem" to "potential mutiny"... 

                                      ARCHER
                    No!  You're not!  Because there is
                    no mutiny, potential or otherwi --

                                      BUCKY (O.S.)
                      Pemberontakan!

  We hear Bucky yell, followed by a huge yell from the pirates.

                                      PIRATES (O.S.)
                      Pemberontakan!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     24

  And as we hear that dreadful host spring into action   weapons
    clattering, calloused feet slapping   Archer turns to Noah.

                                      ARCHER
                    So, is that Malay for --

                                    NOAH
                    Mutiny, yes.
                          (raises clipboard)
                    So I guess I should upgrade it from
                      "potential" to, what would be the...?

                                      RILEY
                      Incipient?

                                    NOAH
                          (starts writing)
                    Ooh, nice...

                                      ARCHER
                    No!  Do not upgrade that mutiny,
                    Noah!  I will tell you!  When it's
                    time!  To upgrade the damn --

    KLINK!  A HAND GRENADE bounces off the side of the (unglassed,
    castle-like) window, hits the floor with a KLUNK, then rolls a
  foot or two and starts to smoke a little with a loud FZZZZZZ...

    A beat as they all look at it, then Archer turns to the others.

                                      ARCHER
                    Mutiny, okay, so...


  Under a low-volume, high-pitched WHINE, we find ourselves in

    RILEY'S POV: a woozy, double-vision PAN of the grenade-blasted
  room: the upended radio desk and chair, papers strewn about...
    here's Noah against the wall, clutching his knees to his chest
  and screaming like Private Ryan... now here's Archer on his
  knees before Riley, holding a (lacrosse) FISH NET, yelling:

                                      ARCHER

                      [unintelligible over the whine]

  CUT TO Riley, squinting, trying to make sense of it.  CUT TO
    Archer, still unintelligible, until a "Lost"-style WHOOSH SFX
  snaps everything, audio and visual, into clarity.  Now we can
  hear Archer, over the crackle of SMALL ARMS FIRE and a pounding
  (of what sounds like a pirate mob) at the thick oaken door.

                                      ARCHER

                    -- is what I was talking about, with
                    the whole tinnitis thing!  You hear
                    that high-pitched whine?  It's like --

                                    NOAH

                          Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

  CUT TO Noah about halfway through this scream, still clutching
  his knees to his chest like Private Ryan, until Archer yells:

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah!

                                    NOAH
                    Aagh!  What?!

                                      ARCHER
                    I -- well for one thing, I'm kinda
                      regretting making you first mate!

                                    NOAH
                    Me too!  Now I'm... management!

  CUT TO Riley, looking out the (unglassed, castle-like) window
  and ducking as a few SLUGS ping into the room through it.

                                      RILEY
                    Archer!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     26

                                      ARCHER
                    What?!

                                      RILEY

                    Shut up!  Noah!

                                    NOAH

                    What?!

                                      RILEY

                    What'd you say about a back-up radio?!

                                    NOAH

                    I -- that we need one!  It's itemmmm...
                          (checks clipboard)
                    Five!

                                      RILEY
                    Oh well that's just --

    KRUNCH!  We hear the door get smashed by something like...

                                      ARCHER
                      A battering ram?


    Outside the radio room, Bucky directs four PIRATES who heave
  back, then slam a (LOG) BATTERING RAM into the door: KRUNCH!

                                      BUCKY
                    Archer!  Kami membunuhmu!


  Riley still at one window, ducking the odd SLUG.  Archer is at
    another, ducking the odd SLUG as he catches   and throws back
    the occasional HAND GRENADE with the FISH NET.  Noah, a deer
  in the headlights, shields himself with his CLIPBOARD.

                                      ARCHER
                    What was that, what'd he say?

                                    NOAH
                    "We're going to kill you."

                                      ARCHER
                    Oh.  Thought they were surrendering.

                                      RILEY
                    Why?!  Would you think that?!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     27

                                      ARCHER
                    They did before!   For no good reason!

                                      RILEY
                    At least then we had assault weapons! 
                    Now we've only got -- give me that!

  Riley snatches his COLT .45 out of Archer's waistband.

                                      ARCHER
                    Yeah go nuts, Sundance, it's empty.

    Archer catches a GRENADE and throws it back out as we CUT TO


  On the upended SHORTWAVE, to show the tight grouping of BULLET
  HOLES which are (one has to admit) pretty damn dead center.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    All six, right in the ten ring...

  WIDE: as we were, dodging SLUGS and tossing back GRENADES.

                                      RILEY
                    Well, congratulations!  We're trapped!

                                      ARCHER
                    We're not --

    KRUNCH!  The thick oaken door gives inward a little, its rusty
    hinges straining, about to pop clean out of the damp stonework.

                                      ARCHER
                    Trapped.  Okay yeah, we're trapped.

                                    NOAH (O.S.)
                    Uh, why don't we just use that?

  They turn toward Noah, who points to a TRAP DOOR in the floor.

                                      ARCHER
                    Well obviously we're gonna use that.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     28

  CUT TO the door as KRUNCH!  KRUNCH!  KRAAWNCH!  The pirates
  smash it off its hinges, knocking it off-screen.  Their eyes
  go wide and we CUT TO their POV: the door has fallen on top of
  the trap door, so it looks like Archer et al. just vanished.

                                      PIRATES
                          (collective gasp, then)
                    Hantu!

                                      BUCKY
                    They not ghosts!  They just white!

                                      PIRATE
                          (low)
                    Rasis.

                                      BUCKY
                    You're racist!


    Malory wails into the crook of her arm on the desk, a DRINK in
  the other hand.  Cheryl/Carol, in her coat, stands beside her.

                                      MALORY
                    Those dirty pirate bastards!  They
                    killed my baby boy-hoy-hooyyy!

    Cheryl/Carol starts to rub Malory's hair, very tentatively.

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Oh now, you don't know that for sure...

    Malory jerks her head up.  Cheryl/Carol yanks her hand away.

                                      MALORY
                          (gasp)
                    You're right!  That sound could've
                    been anything!  Like... a firecracker! 
                    Orientals are crazy for firecrackers!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Oh my God, and rice?

                                      MALORY
                          (wheels turning)
                    Or maybe Rip shot a pirate, and
                    Sterling yelled "No" because he didn't
                    want to give away their position!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Pai Gow...                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     29

                                      MALORY
                    Yes, you know, I bet they've escaped!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                      Dragons...

                                      MALORY
                    Because if anyone can escape from a
                    pirate fortress, it's Sterling and
                    Rip.  Especially if they cooperate.


    Archer (on top), Riley (middle) and Noah (bottom) climb down
  using the rusty iron ladder rungs embedded in the damp stone.

                                      RILEY
                    Damn it, quit stepping on my hands!

                                      ARCHER
                    Quit bossing me around!  You're not

                    you're my father.

                    Fifteen.

                                      ARCHER

                    The feeling's mutual.  Because if my
                    son was as big a bonehead as you --

    Archer looks up as we hear the TRAP DOOR open.  CUT TO his POV
  to see two pirates looking down at him/us.  KLINK!  One of
  them pulls the pin on a GRENADE and holds it over the shaft.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)

                    Not really.  Why?


  Noah hangs by his skinny arms from a large round hole in the
    ceiling of... Riley's cell.

                                    NOAH
                    Just curious.


  Same (vertical) angle but much closer to the trap door as PING! 
  The pirate lets the striker pop off the GRENADE and drops it.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    Go go go go go!

                                      RILEY (O.S.)
                    Waaaagh!

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    Waaaagh!

    WHUMP!  We hear them slam into each other, then the ground.

                                    NOAH (O.S.)
                    Oww!


  The trio lies in a heap, Noah squished on the bottom, as the
    GRENADE falls out of the shaft and hits the floor right in
  front of them with a KLUNK then FIZZES for a tiny beat, then

                                      ARCHER
                    Oh, shi --

    KROOOMP!  A blinding flash, a deafening bang, and we CUT TO


  Where the two pirates give a "fist bump" over the shaft hole.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     32


  The same high-pitched WHINE from before, back in Riley's POV:

    A woozy, double-vision PAN of the grenade-blasted cell: here's
  Noah on his knees, a finger in his ear, mouthing something...
  now here's Archer on his knees before Riley again, yelling:

                                      ARCHER

                      [unintelligible over the whine]

  CUT TO Riley, dazed.  CUT TO Archer, still unintelligible,
  until that same WHOOSH SFX snaps everything back to normal.

                                      ARCHER
                    -- just a flash-bang grenade!  Still
                    super-bad for your ears, though...

                                    NOAH
                    Mawp!  Mawp!

                                      ARCHER
                    So when we get outta here, you should
                    go see my ENT doctor, he's good.

                                      RILEY
                    How the hell...! 

                                    NOAH
                    Mawp!

                                      RILEY
                    Are we supposed to get out of here?!

                                      ARCHER
                    Isn't this your cell?

                                      RILEY
                    Yes!

                                      ARCHER
                    So how'd you get out before?

                                      RILEY
                    I bribed Bucky!

                                    NOAH
                    Mawp!

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     33

                                    NOAH
                    Huh?

                                      ARCHER
                    That is annoying as shit!
                          (to Riley)
                    And I doubt we can bribe Bucky again,
                    since I crippled his girlfriend...

                                      RILEY
                    So what're we supposed to do now?!

  Beat.

                                      ARCHER
                    I dunno.


    Malory   coat on, purse over her shoulder   stands beside her
  desk.  Cheryl/Carol sits behind the desk, arms crossed, pouting. 
    Behind her, in the monitor, Lana's GREEN DOT is now at Pangu.

                                      MALORY
                    But I may as well go home and rest. 
                    If they haven't escaped already,
                    Lana will be there any time now, and
                    she'll get them out.  And it's not
                    like I can do anything from here...

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Exactly!  So why do I have to stay?!

                                      MALORY
                          (as she exits)
                    Because Lana may call.  Or because I
                    said so.  Pick one.


  On Cyril, snoring gently, face down at his desk, which is
    covered with printouts, spreadsheets, etc., the bottle of "OLD
    BUNCOMBE" BOURBON and GLASS.  His open door is in background.

                                      CYRIL
                    [snoring gently, maybe mumbling?]

    Malory walks past Cyril's door, backs up a step, WHISTLES.

                                      CYRIL
                    Waagh!

  Cyril jerks bolt upright, maybe knocking over the bottle.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     34

                                      MALORY
                    And why the hell are you still here?

                                      CYRIL
                    I, um, this is, uh, what was I doing?

                                      MALORY
                    Whatever it was, you better pray it
                    had about three coats of Scotch-Gard.

    Malory gestures with her thumb and we CUT TO see Pam is passed
  out, face down and nude, on Cyril's sofa.  If he has a coffee
  table it has TO-GO PITA and MARGARITA CUP on it (if not on the
    table, the floor).  Pam gives a teeny, high, 1.5 second POOT.

                                      CYRIL
                    And that it wasn't, ick, Pam...

                                      MALORY
                    [sound of utter disgust]

    Malory makes that sound and exits.  Pam POOTS again, shorter.

                                      CYRIL
                    Ugh...


    Archer leans his forearms through the bars.  Riley pulls vainly
  on the bars (on the other side of the door from where Archer
  is leaning, keeping door free).  Noah jumps up, repeatedly,
    trying to reach the hole in the ceiling (missing by three feet).

                                      ARCHER
                    We set Noah on fire --

                                    NOAH
                    What?

                                      ARCHER
                    -- and when they come to put him
                    out, we overpower them.

                                      RILEY
                    Don't have a lighter.

                                      ARCHER
                    Well then I'm out of ideas.

                                      BUCKY (O.S.)
                    And also out of luck!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     36


  Bucky strolls in smugly, flanked by two pirates with AK-47's,
  and sets about unlocking the door with some big old-timey KEYS.

                                      BUCKY
                    Because no rescue for you, Archer! 
                    We catch your friends on beach!

    Gillette walks into the shot, HANDCUFFED behind his back.  He
  walks past Archer, and into the now open cell, without a word.

                                      ARCHER
                    My -- Ray?!  Holy shit, where'd you --
                          (starts laughing)
                    -- get that eyepatch?!  What're you,
                    in pirate disguise?!  Good job, buddy!

  Now Lana walks into the shot, HANDCUFFED behind her back. 

    Riley's eyebrow slides up ("She's hot!") when he sees her, but
  we quickly CUT TO Archer, very nearly spluttering with relief,
  his mocking tone now gone, replaced by (actual) genuine feeling.

                                      ARCHER
                    Lana?!  You, you came all this way?! 
                    To rescue me?  Oh my God...

                                    LANA
                    [takes a breath, about to speak]

                                      ARCHER
                          (a shithead again)
                    Still got it pretty bad for me, huh?

  Lana exhales, walks into the cell.  KLANG!  Bucky slams the
  door closed behind her.  Archer grins, starts to chuckle.

                                      ARCHER
                    [starts to chuckle]

                                    LANA
                    Archer, don't you --

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooooo!

  And as he flashes Lana that shit-eating grin (yet again), we
