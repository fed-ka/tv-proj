      Alicia heads past a landscaped yard and up to the front door 
    of a large, traditional home.  Alicia becomes aware of 
      VOICES.  Lots of them.  A charity function?  A social 
      gathering?  Alicia looks back at the car; Kenny meekly waves, 
      slumps out of view.  Alicia steels herself, rings the bell.  
      LAUREN CHATHAM opens the door.

                    Hi Lauren.  

      Lauren is stunned to see her.  So are a dozen female 
      contemporaries hovering in the b.g.  

      Clearly, she s the subject of intense curiosity.  Lauren, for 
    her part, doesn t know how to handle this unexpected visit.

                    like this, but... I need to talk to 
                    you about Kenny.

      FLASHBACK - TEN YEARS EARLIER - DAYA14A14

      Alicia is an regular participant in these community meetings.  
      Stands near a punch bowl as Lauren sidles up.  Whispers --

                                  LAUREN
                    Unless we can start serving 
                    cocktails, I m quitting the board.

                                  ALICIA
                    You re terrible, you know that?

      They grin as 8 YEAR OLD KENNY steps up, wanting Mom s 
      attention.  Instead, he gets Alicia s; she smiles at the boy, 
      smooths his hair as-- 

                                  LAUREN
                    Honey, Mommy s busy.

      Alicia feels for the disappointed boy as he pads off, leaving 
      Lauren to survey the room, ostensibly put upon.  

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    I m just saying... someone else has 
                    to start hosting these meetings.

                                  ALICIA
                    Please, you love this.

                    Maybe.  But I couldn t do it 
                    without you.

    It seemed sincere.  At the time.  Then, Lauren notices an 
      urbane woman across from them, noting --

      FLASHBACK- CAPSTONE PREPARATORY SCHOOL- 3 YEARS EARLIER- DAY2626

      Alicia drops off a nervous 12 year old Grace (geeky in 
      braces) on her first day of high school.  

                                  GRACE
                    I don t like it.

                    And they won t like me.

      Alicia locks eyes with her insecure daughter.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Grace, this is the best school in 
                    the county.  It has a great 
                    academic program and a very good 
                    sports program.  Just give it time.  
                    I think you re really going to love 
                    it here.

      She s snapped out of her reverie by the roar of a couple of  
      BMW s driven by privileged teens showing them off.

                                  CARY

                    Reminds me of the high schools I 
                    used to vandalize.


      Alicia and Cary walk toward 17 year old SPENCER RANKIN, 
      leaning against a wall, backpack at his feet as the chats up 
      a girl.   

                                  ALICIA

                    friends.  

    He looks at Alicia, suspicious of her natural authority.  He 
      picks up his gear, starts to go.  Cary gets in step with him.  

                                  CARY

    do his thing.

                    in this neighborhood after 11 -- 
                    definitely would ve been noticed.  

    As they head across the street, Kalinda takes note of the 
      pristine surroundings.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Think they ve got enough manicured 
                    lawns here?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Grass can t be taller than two 
                    inches.

                    Neighborhood association wields a 
                    mighty sword.

                                  KALINDA
                    Pretty, doesn t seem like a good 
                    fit though -- your living here.  
                    Was it?

                                  ALICIA
                    Did it for over ten years, liked it 
                    at the time. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Ignorance is bliss, I guess.

    It stings, but before Alicia can respond, Kalinda knocks.


      Alicia and Kalinda look at a map of the area.  

                                  ALICIA
                    The Rankin house is about half a 
                    mile west of here.  

                                  KALINDA
                    The security guard called into 
                    operations at 11:15 to say he was 
                    doing a perimeter check and he was 
                    dead by 11:20.  

                                  ALICIA
                    The prosecution would argue that 
                    there was still time for Kenny to 
                    have attacked the guard and made it 
                    home on foot by 11:25 -- but is 
                    that even possible?  

                                  KALINDA
                    Run that distance in five minutes?  
                    Only one way to find out.  THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   34.




      Continued police presence.  Crime scene tape visible. 

                                  KALINDA
                    Guess there s no chance the S.A. 
                    will let us in without permission.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t exactly have a good relationship 
                    with the department anymore.  

      Kalinda smiles, best she can do is pictures.  Then, CARL 
      RANKIN (50 s) emerges from the main house, beelines for them.  

                                  RANKIN
                    You get within a hundred feet of my 
                    son again and I ll sue you, the 
                    Chathams, and your entire firm.  He s 
                    got nothing to do with this and how 
                    dare you intimidate him into giving 
                    false information.  There was never 
                    any permission given to enter, and 
                    there was never any pot and he s never 
                    going to testify -- you got that, 
                    lady?  Now get the hell off my 
                    property.

      With that, he turns, goes.  Off Alicia and Kalinda.  


      Cary and Raines walk.  Very date-like vibe. 

                                  RAINES
                    Thanks for lunch.  It was... very 
                      satisfying.  

                                  CARY
                    So, maybe we mix it up next time, 
                    try dinner?

                                  RAINES
                    I d like that.

    She smiles, takes out a business card, writes her number on 
    the back of it.  Electricity between them.  But her CELL 
      RINGS.  She answers, holds a finger up -- give me a sec.

                                  RAINES (CONT D)
                          (into cell)
                    Hello?

    She hands him her card; he studies it, proud of the conquest.

                                  RAINES (CONT'D)
                          (into phone)
                    Really.  Okay.  Thanks.

    She clicks off.  Disappointment on her face.

                                  RAINES (CONT D)
                    Deal s off.  

                                  CARY
                    What?

                                  RAINES
                    You lost Spencer Rankin -- his 
                    father just called our office.  
                    Burglary s back on the table.  
                          (then)
                    See you in court.


      Alicia walks Grace away from the home she was visiting, and 
      toward their car.  Zach leans against it, impatient and 
      texting.    

                                  ALICIA
                    You have a good time?

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah.  Except I forgot how much of 
                    a whiner Janna was.

                                  ZACH
                    I didn t.  

                                  GRACE
                    Like your friends aren t geeks.

    He smirks at his sister, opens the front passenger door but 
      continues to text.  Alicia opens the rear door for her.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Can we please go home now? 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #102 "You Can't Go Home Again" YELLOW COLL. 8/24/09   46.

                                  ALICIA
                          (checks her watch)
                    Told you I had to make more than 
                    one stop, remember?

                                  GRACE
                    Tell me you re not taking us to the 
                    crime scene.

                                  ZACH
                          (finally interested)
                    Seriously?  Awesome...

                                  GRACE
                    This is the real reason we came, isn t it?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Shoot me for having more than one.  


      Alicia s car rolls up.  She takes in the Rankin home.  Dark.

                                  ALICIA
                    Tape s all gone -- neighborhood 
                      association probably pulled it down 
                      themselves.  Looks like no one s home.
                          (sheclimbs out; to kids)
                    Stay here.

      Alicia furtively heads for the rear of the property.  


      Alicia scopes out the guest apartment above the garage.  Sees 
    the window that was jimmied open, the bushes Brian hid 
      behind.  Just like the model.  Stands where Brian would have 
      stood, checking the vantage point.  A clear shot.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Damn.

    But just then, she gets hit with a spray of cold water: timed 
      sprinklers.  She shrieks, jumps out of the way, soaking wet 
    in seconds.  Pissed, cold... but realizing something.
