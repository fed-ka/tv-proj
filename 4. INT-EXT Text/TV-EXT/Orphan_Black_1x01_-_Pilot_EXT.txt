      She s disgorged among the crowd, clutching the out-of-
      character purse.  Daylight hits her, street noise.  She pulls
      aside to get her bearings.  Skyscrapers tower all around,
      disorienting.  She picks a direction, heads off, holding
      herself to a fast walk.


      On a wide, empty sidewalk.  Sarah checks the address of the
      drivers license.  Looks up at a sleek, high end building.
      Nice.


      A bank of buzzers.  Swipe the key card, lock tumbles, slip
      in ...                                                                                      8. 



      Cross to elevator, hit the button.  An edgy wait, floors
      ticking down.  Shit - a moo-moo wearing WOMAN, 60 s, entering
      the lobby with a drop-kick sized dog. Sarah keeps her back
      turned.

                                      WOMAN
                    Beth?

      The dog starts barking at her furiously.

                                      WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    Pookie, stop that!

      Ding.  Elevator door opens. Sarah quickly hits floor 14.

                                      WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    Beth, hold the --

      The door slides closed.


      Sarah hustles back to Beth s.  So far, so good.  Except the
      heels are killing her. She bends down to take off the shoes,
      and is suddenly struck by a...

      VISION-FLASH:  The train station platform.  Beth bending to
      take off her shoes, identical.

      Sarah stands up quickly, wierded-out in a dead girl's clothes. 
      Ignore it, keep walking barefoot, almost  home .  But as she
      steps off the curb ...

      An unmarked police car skids up, cutting her off.  Out hops
      a plain clothes COP, early 30 s, black, pissed right off. 
      He eyes the shoes in her hand like she s crazy.

                                    COP
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                      SARAH
                    Is there a law against walking
                    barefoot?

                                    COP
                    Get in the car.

                                      SARAH
                    Why?

                                    COP
                    Don t fuck with me, Beth.

      Oh no, he knows her.  No choice, she reaches for the back
      door.

                                    COP (CONT'D)
                    In the front.  I ain t Drivin  Miss
                    Daisy.

                                      SARAH
                    Okay.  Calm down.

      He gets in behind the wheel.  Freaking out, she goes around
      to the passenger side...                                                                                      20. 



      Art pulls the car into a space.  He gets out fast and starts
      walking.


      She gets out, every Cop watching.  WTF is going on?

      Bull through, catch up to Art, make him fall into stride
      across the lot. Right up the wide front steps, in through
      the front door.


      Instant composure.  Sarah steps calmly out the door, picks
      the alley mouth offering the most traffic.


      Steps into pedestrian flow.  Checks her back.

      An unfamiliar phone chirps in her bag.  Still moving, she
      fishes out Beth s usual phone, but it s the other phone that
      chirps again, the one that hasn t rung yet                                                                                      28. 


                                      SARAH
                    The pink phone ...

      Its a TEXT:  1/2 blk mre, blk BMW, get in.  Sarah stops dead. 
      Scans the block ahead ...

      Half way up - black BMW, tinted windows, idling.

      Now what?  Jump down another rabbit hole?  She s stuck.  
      The BMW revs it s engine.  But then she sees ... Art.

      INTERCUT:


      He's on the sidewalk, casting about for Beth.  Pissed, he
      pulls out his phone.

      Sarah picks the devil she knows, turns quickly his way,
      slipping into Beth's "skin".  She switches to Beth's black
      phone and beats him to the dial.

      Art s phone rings as he s dialing.

                                    ART
                    The fuck, Beth --?

                                      SARAH
                    Easy.  I m right here ...

      He sees her coming, scours, still on the line.

      An engine roars. A backward glance.  Sarah sees the black
      BMW pulling away into traffic.

      Sarah and Art hang up next to each other.  She s on the
      offensive.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Don t start.  I needed to be alone
                    for a minute.

      Art just shakes his head at her, deeply disappointed.

                                    ART
                    You swore you were off the meds.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm a mess. What do you want me to
                    say?

                                    ART
                    Jesus Christ. How many pills do you
                    have to swallow to puke all over a
                      Disciplinary Hearing?                                                                                      29. 


                                      SARAH
                    More than I took.  I had to drink
                    hand soap too.

      It has that odd ring of truth that makes Art think twice.

                                    ART
                    You did that on purpose?

                                      SARAH
                    I was gonna screw it up, Art. I
                    panicked.  I just need some more
                    time to get my head straight.

                                    ART
                    A couple days they reconvene.

                                      SARAH
                    I'll be ready, I promise.

                                    ART
                    And now they fucking hate you.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm good. I'll walk in and just stick
                    to my statement.

      Art appears to soften. He reaches out to put a hand on his
      partner's shoulder. But instead he seizes the back of her
      neck and squeezes, dead fucking serious.

                                    ART
                    Just so we're clear, partner. I won't
                    let you burn my career.

      He turns and walks away. Sarah is rattled.


      The security door rolls up slow, revealing the Audi, Sarah
      behind the wheel.  She pulls out.


      Art is parked down the block, staking her out in his car. 
      He slumps down as she passes, starts his engine, pulls out
      after her.


      Sarah s car passes ...

      The black, tinted BMW at the curb.

      As Art s car passes, the BMW pulls out, starts tailing the
      both of them.


      Sarah parks, gets out with purse and briefcase.

      ANGLE ON:  Art pulls in a short way off.  Watches her go
      into the bank.

      ANGLE ON:  The black BMW, rolling slowly past.                                                                                      43. 



      Art, backed into a parking space watches ...

      Sarah emerge from the bank, cross the lot. She opens the
      trunk of the Audi, drops in the bag containing the money,
      slams it closed.


      Sarah s car pulls out into traffic.

      Art pulls in behind, leaving a couple cars between them.


      Sarah hops out of the car and hurries into the building

                                      SARAH (V.O.)
                    You're in your bathrobe, all pissed
                    off at me, and I'm coming over ...

      ANGLE ON: Art's car pulls up nearby. As she disappears in
      the building, he gets out, eyeing the Audi.


      Sarah emerges from the building and gets into the Audi. 

      REVEAL:  Art's car is no longer where he parked. He's gone.

      But the black BMW is there, nothing visible beyond it's tinted
      windows. As the Audi starts up, it does the same.


      The Audi rises above city streets onto a highway overpass.
      The BMW is on it's tail.


      As the Audi passes, the cityscape breaks down:  factory
      shells, decrepit warehouses, rusting lakers alongside canals.                                                                                      45. 



      A barren lot, clumps of bush along the water. The Audi parks
      overlooking the harbour.


      Sarah gets out of the car, walks a short distance down the
      shore to get a better view.

      She settles down and steadies the binoculars on the group. 
      Moans in dismay.

      SARAH S POV: Emotional Vic is delivering a eulogy.  He cradles
      the urn before a motley group of misfit MOURNERS - a couple
      of BIKERS with their old LADIES, a ROCKABILLY GUY, a teary-
      eyed, chain smoking girl, SHERRY.  And Felix, standing a
      little aside, perversely enjoying the whole charade.

      Sarah growls at him and pulls out her phone.


                                    VIC
                    She grew up rough, you know, so it
                    was always fight or flight with her
                    ... you want to hang on to someone
                    like that. I m sorry, Sarah.  I m an
                    asshole, I got some work to do. I m
                    sorry ...

      Under this, Felix checks his vibrating phone, smirks, edges
      further away. Quietly answers.

                                      FELIX (ON PHONE)
                    So?  Heaven or Hell?

                                      SARAH (ON PHONE)
                    I didn t want a funeral for this
                    very reason.                                                                                      46. 


                                      FELIX
                    Can t do much about that when you re
                    dead, can you? 

                                      SARAH (ON PHONE)
                    I m watching, right now.

                                      FELIX (ON PHONE)
                    Oh. I dressed Vic. How do we look? 

      Sarah sighs, her anger subsiding a little.  Her POV settles
      on the Rockabilly guy.

                                      SARAH (ON PHONE)
                    Not as good as Rockabilly Bob.

                                      FELIX (ON PHONE)
                    I know, still rockabilly after all
                    these years, you have to respect
                    that.

      SARAH S POV moves to: a bored BIKER and his leather-fringed
      BIMBO, totally unconnected.

                                      SARAH (ON PHONE)
                    I don t even know that bitch with
                    the fringe.
                          (POV to smoking girl)
                    Sherry s upset though.

                                      FELIX (ON PHONE)
                    She thinks Vic pushed you in front
                    of the train.  Priceless, really.

                                      SARAH (ON PHONE)
                    I got the money, Fee. I still want
                    us to be together.  It can work.

      Felix is silent.  Vic is glaring sideways.

                                      FELIX (ON PHONE)
                    Vic s getting mad I m taking a call.

      SARAH S POV:  The binoculars leave Felix and focus on a car
      pulling up behind them.

      A woman gets out - MRS. S, 60, heavyset, no-nonsense, working
      class Brit through and through.  Sarah s heart sinks.

                                      SARAH (ON PHONE)
                    Mrs. S.

      Felix spots Mrs. S with the same  oh shit  reaction.                                                                                      47. 


      SARAH S POV:  In the back seat is KIRA, 9, precocious,
      observant, too smart by half.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Felix, Kira is there!

      Felix beelines to head off Mrs. S.

                                      SARAH (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck did you do?  My daughter
                    can t think I m dead!


                                      SARAH (ON PHONE)
                    Felix! Felix?

      She s yelling into a dead phone.  Powerless, she hangs up,
      watches through the binoculars, trying to read body language.

      SARAH S POV:  Mrs. S is stern and concerned, interrogating
      him.  Felix placates, shepherding her back towards the car.
      Mrs. S gets angrily in and drives off.

      But WTF happened?  Sarah s gut-sick, a visceral reaction.
      She retreats to the car.  At a loss, she gets in.


      Sarah reels. Katja gets out of the back. 

                                      KATJA
                      Entschuldigung!  Sorry!

                                      SARAH
                    Keep the fuck away from me.

                                      KATJA
                    Beth, it s Katja. 

                                      SARAH
                    Holy shit, holy, holy fuckin shit.

      Sarah retreats, circling the car, keeping it between them,
      Katja waving that pink cell phone.

                                      KATJA
                    Bitte, Beth, I need to see the Doctor.

                                      SARAH
                    See whoever you want.

                                      KATJA
                    The Doctor must call me.

                                      SARAH
                    Just stay back.

                                      KATJA
                    I m Katja. Katja Obinger, Beth.

                                      SARAH
                    I get it, okay?  The German. I've
                    seen your birth certificate.

                                      KATJA
                    Jah. You asked for it. For proof.

                                      SARAH
                    Proof of what?

                                      KATJA
                    All of it, Beth.                                                                                      49. 


      Katja has a coughing spasm, hacks up clotted blood into a
      handkerchief.  Begs Sarah over her bloody hands ...

                                      KATJA (CONT'D)
                    Please. I need the Doctor.

      Blood on her chin, on the pink cell phone.  Sarah is
      horrified.

                                      SARAH
                    I can t help you.

      She s worked around to the drivers door again, quickly gets
      in.


      The Audi peels backwards, running over debris.

      Sarah stays low, peering out the rear window.  Hits a bump,
      yelps as Katja s still-seated body falls over.  Yelps as
      another bullet rips through the windshield.

      The Audi punches through a chain-link fence, skids Rockford-
      style into the street.

      Sarah shifts into first, lights up the tires.  She madly
      corrects the wheel as ...

      The Audi fishtails up onto the curb, bounces back into the
      street and speeds away.


      Felix bites his lip, deeply concerned with Mrs. S and Kira.
      His reactionary memorial is backfiring as he watches ...

      Vic holding the urn. Mourners dip handfuls of ash, wander
      off to say their private good-byes.

      Handfuls of  Sarah  tossed into the lake, the wind not
        cooperating, small clouds of ash blowing away.

      Vic, doing some kind of Ganges River thing, wades out in his
      suit, scatters the ashes in circles around himself.

      Felix at the water s edge, sighs at the scene.  He lowers
      his handful of ash to the surface, slowly letting the water
      seep into his hands, making a slurry.                                                                                      51. 


                                      FELIX
                    Sorry, Elizabeth Childs.


      The Audi careens into an derelect industrial lot and skids
      to a halt.


      Sarah paces, the phone in her hand. Her thumb is poised to
      answer, but she's terrified.

      She hits the button, stays quiet. She can hear breathing.

      Sarah switches voices and body language to "Beth".

                                      SARAH
                    Hello?
