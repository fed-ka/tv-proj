 
The jumbo jet, flying in the awful storm.  A sarcophagus, at 
    forty-thousand feet.  The cause of this gruesome event an 
  absolute mystery.  And things are about to get weirder. 
 
And as if to announce this fact, from the VERY EDGES OF  
FRAME, WHITE LETTERS APPEAR  - and CONVERGE NEAR THE RIGHT  
SIDE OF FRAME as the rest of the image, the background, TURNS 
GREY  - and our short but spooky THEME PLAYS as the LETTERS 
TURN BLACK  - AND SPELL, SIMPLY: 
 
                              F  R  I  N  G  E 
 
  FADE IN: 
 
 
  A cheap-ass motel.  An old neon TURNPIKE MOTEL sign.  The 
  constant SQUEAKING of a flimsy BOX SPRING is HEARD  - and as  
we DOLLY IN, WORDS FADE IN (NOTE: A SIGNATURE OF THE SERIES 
  WILL BE HOW LOCATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED  - WORDS WILL APPEAR 
    THREE-DIMENSIONALLY, AS IF EXISTING WITHIN THE SPACE).  In  
  this case they read:  LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTES , PUSH PAST  
THE WORDS to   
 
 
  PUSH IN, past the (signature, three-dimensional) WORDS THAT 
  FADE IN:  LOGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT   BOSTON    this is an  8

  access gate  - three POLICE CARS are here, lights BLAZING, 
  FLASHING in the night. 
 
  Olivia pulls up in her black hybrid Lexus, shows her creds. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        Olivia Warren, FBI. 
 
  Guards check her ID, squawk walkies, wave her in.  BOOM UP to 
  reveal the JUMBO JET from the opening, a light-show of two 
dozen EMERGENCY VEHICLES, including a CRANE, surrounding it.  
  Olivia parks, gets out  - crosses half a dozen FEDERAL  
  AGENTS, all ARGUING issues of protocol, information, 
    jurisdiction.  An angry, heated fight.  Olivia continues past 
them, met by 43 year-old fellow Agent CHARLIE FRANCIS. 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                        Inter-agency harmony and 
                        cooperation continues. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Who s winning? 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                        Langley by a nose. 
                              (then, re: jet) 
                        Flight out of Hamburg  - hundred  
                      and forty-seven passengers, towers  
                      lost contact three hours in.   
                        Thought there might ve been some  
                        electrical interference, apparently 
                      they were flying in a hell of a  
                        storm.  They entered our airspace  
                      radio silent -  Navy scrambled two  
                        F-18 s for escort.  They reported  
                        stains on the windows...and no  
                      signs of life aboard the jet. 
 
  This stop Olivia  - she looks up at the jet  - the cabin is too 
  dark for her to see anything. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        Stains? 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                        Blood. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      I m surprised they let  em land  - 
                       No signs of life  -  who was flying  
                      the plane, auto-pilot?

                                      CHARLIE 
                        Programmed to land right on  
                        schedule, which it did.  Unlike  
                      every flight I ve ever taken. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      If there was a decompression the  
                        windows would have frozen solid  - 
                      have they opened the cabin? 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                      White House approved a CDC request  
                      for the jet not to be opened until  
                      they arrive. 
 
  Behind them, a BLACK VAN arrives.  The drive gets out   
  it s JOHN, on a cell: 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      let me assure you, we d be happy 
                      to treat you like family too. 
                              (hangs up, grins) 
                      Good old NTSB.  All like to think  
                        they re cops. 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                      Agent Scott. 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      Agent Francis  - 
                              (no special regard) 
                      Agent Warren. 
 
Their relationship, their secret.  She turns back to Charlie: 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      They must ve looked in through the  
                        windows& 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                      CIA did.  Whatever the hell s  
                      inside that plan made Special  
                      Agent McNeary throw up in front  
                      of his whole unit.  And he s a  
                      good man, that was embarrassing.  
 
    A finger-to-mouth WHISTLE turns everyone to PHILLIP BROYLES, 
  SPECIAL-AGENT-IN CHARGE from HOMELAND SECURITY.  Broyles is a 
  bureaucratic Hitler, with authority to puppeteer the Federal 
and International agencies on-scene:

                      four HAZ-MAT suits, we should have 
                      your size in the van!  Move! 
 
Agents on the move, Olivia, disturbed, goes after Broyles: 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Sir: Olivia Warren, FBI Inter- 
                      agency liaison, I m EOD and NBC  
                        certified, I d like to suit up too-  
 
                                      BROYLES 
                        Liaison on an inter-agency task 
                      force.  Gotta love that.  Like 
                        powdered sugar on a glazed donut. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Excuse me, if I m gonna do my job  
                        effectively, I like my information  
                        first-hand -  that s not  
                        redundancy, that s accountability. 
 
                                      BROYELS 
                              (sotto, threatening) 
                      I know exactly who you are.  You  
                      put my best friend in prison two  
                      years ago. 
                              (she s stunned, louder:) 
                      You want in, Liaison?  Suit up. 
 
And the bully walks off   Olivia watches him go, indignant.

  VARIOUS SHOTS as CDC MEDCIAL OFFICERS connect an AIRLOCK to a 
  door outside the plane -  a twelve-foot-long elevated  
  corridor with three clean-room compartments.  A staircase  
leads up to it. 
 
Now there are FOUR CDC OFFICERS in HAZ-MAT suits.  They start 
up the stairs.  Following them are Olivia, Charlie and the  
  rest of the appointed agents, also in HAZ-MATS.  At first, NO 
  MUSIC.  Just the odd collage of oxygen tanks: INHALE&  EXHALE& 
 
The CDC Officer pulls out the recessed jet door handle.   
Turns it.  The HISS of DECOMPRESSION.  TIGHT ON OLIVIA S EYES 
as she anxiously watches the plane DOOR OPEN.  Darkness and 
  mist inside.  Their FLASHLIGHTS come alive: CLICK, CLICK, 
  CLICK, CLICKCLICK.  And they enter. 
 
  Olivia s eyes GO WIDE at what she sees. 
 
                                    CDC OFFICER 
                              (filtered) 
                      &holy God& 
 
    Red/white/blue FLASHES of emergency lights from outside and 
their flashlights the only illumination.  Every passenger  
dead.  Unrecognizable.  Crumple CLOTHES lie in GELATIN,  
BLOOD and BONE.  Tears come to Olivia s eyes   her breathing 
  uneven as she moves through the plane.  Charlie sees this: 
 
                                      CHARLIE 
                        Warren...you okay? 
 
OFF OLIVIA S STARING EYES, answering that question& 
 
 
Where Olivia drove in  - a passing WHITE VAN stops  - all 
  windows TINTED.  Even the front windshield has mild shading.  
The driver s window LOWERS a few inches, we don t yet see the 
  silhouetted DRIVER who asks on of the GUARDS about the POLICE 
  ACTIVITY surrounding the plane on the distant tarmac: 
 
                                      DRIVER 
                        Excuse me  - what s going on?  Some  
                      sort of problem? 
 
                                      GUARD 
                        Nothing you need to know about, sir  
                      -  please keep moving. 
  12

  PUSH IN on the Driver as he leans into the light -  REVEALING 
  THAT HE S THE SAME MAN WE SAW FROM THE AIRPLANE -  THE ONE WHO 
  INJECTED HIMSELF   WHO MELTED FIRST: TROUBLED! 
 
                                      DRIVER 
                      Okay&I ll do that.  Thanks. 
 
And with an eerily satisfied smile, the Driver DRIVES AWAY.  
And as our minds somersault, we CUT TO: 
 
  TELEVISION SCREENS -  DOLLY PAST an array of TV MONITORS of 
  NEWSCASTS all reporting on the plane  - LONG LENS SHOTS OF THE 
  ARILINER on the tarmac, NOW ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  Over this, 
  REPORTERS, some outside Logan, others in newsrooms: 
 
                                      VARIOUS REPORTERS 
                      --sources tell us the plane was  
                        deliberately set ablaze by the CDC 
                        shortly after landing/speculate  
                      some kind of hazardous materials on- 
                      board Flight 627/security has been  
                      increased in most airports, with  
                      many canceling out-bound flights -  
 
  Someone CROSSES -  FOLLOW HIM TO REVEAL we re in: 
 
 
  Middle of nowhere, grey day.  A govt-issue sedan FLIES  
  through frame against rural farmland  - 
 
 
  A MASSIVE STORAGE FACILITY.  Our 3D letters bleed in:  U- 
STORE STORAGE -  BACK BAY, MASSACHUSETTS.   The sedan pulls  
up.  Olivia and John steps out. 
 
 
Row after row of cinder-block, garage-sized units.  Olivia  
and John look around. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      That wasn t too much, was it?  The  
                      dry cleaning thing? 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      By your standards I though it was  
                        pretty tame. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      Petty bastard - he s pissed that  
                      his best friend sexually assaulted  
                      three Marine privates and I m the  
                      bad guy  cause I put him away. 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      He s an idiot.  You re smarter,  
                        stronger and more beautiful than he  
                      is, he s jealous.

She stops walking   after a few steps, he stops, turns back to 
  her: 
 
                                    JOHN (CONT D) 
                      What? 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      You said you loved me.  In the  
                        motel.  That was a big deal. 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      Yeah, you didn t say anything back.   
                        I thought I d let it go. 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      It freaked me out.  Not because it  
                        doesn t make me happy.   
                              (beat)   
                      I ve been sort of&bad with this.   
                      For a long time.  The alpha girl  
                      thing hasn t always gone over super- 
                      well. 
                              (beat) 
                      Until you. 
                              (beat, sweetly awkward) 
                        I wanted to say I love you, too. 
 
He moves to her.  Kisses her.  Then, faux-romatically: 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      Let s go check the trash together. 
 
She laughs -- and we TIME JUMP to them going through a  
  dumpster -  pulling out a DISCARDED, UNLABELED CHEMICAL 
  CANISTER.  Then ANOTHER.  She opens one: 
 
        OLIVIA       JOHN 
Empty  -       -- acetylene, 
  propane? 
   (sniffs the nozzle) 
-- no  - it s ammonia. 
 
  A look between them.  He turns to the nearest STORAGE UNIT, 
  emboldened, starts PICKING THE LOCK  - 
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                        What re you doing? 
 
                                    JOHN 
                      What are you doing?  I m a Federal agent. 
 
SNAP: the lock gives.  He grabs the handle on the roll-up   16

metal door and heaves, it SLIDES UP  - REVEALLING A FUCKING 
  LABORATORY. Shelves filled with GAS CANISTERS, CHEMICAL 
  BOTTLES, COOLING UNITS  - AND LARGE SPECIMEN JARS, FILLED  
WITH DISFIGURED SMALL ANIMALS& 
 
  Olivia and John trade a look: holy shit. 
 
SMASH CUT TO another roll-up metal door SLIDING UP  - ANOTHER 
LAB; VACUUM EQUIPMENT, RADIOLOGICAL SUITS, ELECTRON 
  MICROSCOPES, IMAGE ANALYSIS EQUIPMENT, AND THREE CAGES 
  CONTAINING SMALL, MUTATED, VISCOUS CREATURES. 
 
And then ANOTHER  - and ANOTHER  - all the labs dangerous, 
  lethal - 
 
                                    JOHN (CONT D) 
                      We gotta get a chem transport team  
                      out here now   
 
                                      OLIVIA 
                      I m on it. 
                              (but:) 
                      -- no signal  - 
 
She heads away to make the call& 
 
  TIMECUT: A NEARBY FIELD  - Olivia on her cell, moving for a 
better signal  - 
 
                                      OLIVIA (CONT D) 
                      We need PPE and emergency  
                        equipment, HAZ-MAT specialists for  
                      site analysis - 
 
WITH JOHN 
 
  Another roll-up metal door SLIDES UP revealing more LAB SPACE  
-  he moves into it cautiously, checking out equipment    
sees a COMPUTER MONITOR -  sees on the screen: PROGRAMS 
  RUNNING, BALANCING CHEMICAL EQUATIONS. TIGHT ON JOHN S FACE, 
eyes wide like he s hit paydirt -  then, behind him, forty  
feet away, another storage unit opens -  a FIGURE APPEARING 
INSIDE  - another LAB behind him -  and HOLY SHIT, IT S THE 
  DRIVER  - THE MAN FROM THE PLANE: TROUBLED! 
 
  John turns  - sees him -  Troubled s eyes go wide -  AND HE 
  RUNS  - John pulls his gun -  runs after him -- 
 
  Troubled is FAST -  turning a far corner in the maze of  
  storage units -  and John runs after him -  pulling out his 
phone and hitting speed-dial  - but he gets NO SIGNAL -

                      I m on my way! 
 
-- and Olivia runs toward the back as John runs -  and we re 
  MOVING FAST, INTERCUTTING between Troubled, John and Olivia -  
a cat and mouse chase  - 
 
  Troubled -  RUNNING -  pulls out a PHONE, dials a number,  
  hits send, but doesn t bring the phone to his ear  - 
 
  INSIDE THE SHEDS   CIRCUIT DETONATORS MOUNTED ON THE CEILING 
  ACTIVATE, A GREEN LIGHT SNAPS ON -  A SPARK AND FLASH AND

  Suddenly: KABOOOOOOM!!!  THE FIRST SHED DETONATES -- JOHN 
  DISAPPEARS IN A BLAST OF CHEMICAL GREEN  - now the NEXT SHED 
BLOWS   and Olivia s HURLED backwards as the place continues  
to EXPLODE!  CLOSE ON OLIVIA ON THE GROUND  - ULTRA-SLOW

                                        ACT TWO 
 
 
  PUSH IN as a MILITARY HUMMER passes, revealing a village piazza 
  with an old fortress at one end and a BRAND-SPANKING 
NEW BUILDING at the other.  3D letters appear:  AL-SAREED HOTEL 
    BAGHDAD, IRAQ.  
 
                                      OLIVIA (V.O.) 
                      He s a high school dropout.  IQ at  
                      190, which is fifty points north of  
                        genius.  Misfit.  Nomad.  Hasn t  
                      kept a job longer than two months. 
 
  A TAXI pulls up in front and a MAN gets out.  This is PETER 
  BISHOP.  35, handsome, fit.  A quick glance and you see a 
  swagger.  Drive, confidence.  A closer look shows a sadness.  
    Desperation.  We ll learn more -  but for now, just know  
Peter is our third lead.  He looks up at the building,  
  readying himself. 
 
                              OLIVIA (V.O.) (CONT D) 
                      He s been a wildland fireman, an  
                        Alaskan crab fisherman, truck  
                        mechanic, a cargo pilot and,  
                        briefly, a college chemistry  
                        professor.  He falsified a degree  
                      from MIT, and even managed to get a  
                      few papers published before he was  
                      found out.  Sounds like a massive  
                      pain in the ass. 
 
 
  A grey countryside.  3D LETTERS FADE IN:  ESSEX COUNTY, 
    MASSACHUSETTS  and they FADE OUT as Olivia s black car drives 
along  - passing a sign that reads,  ST. CLARIE S   3 MILES . 
 
 
The MUSIC CONTINUES as we find a cold, VA-looking building in 
the midst of beautiful countryside.  A SIGN,  ST CLAIRE S 
  HOSPITAL .  PUSH IN as Olivia s car arrives, she and Peter  
  step out.  Olivia and Peter enter. 
 
 
  Olivia s car SPEEDS PAST CAMERA -- we HEAR A RADIO REPORT: 
 
                                      ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
                        & President s press conference,  
                      where he assured the public that  
                        progress was being made-- 
 
 
  Olivia s car comes toward us  - growing  - and passes -  we  
  WHIP PAN to follow it and as it drives off we PUSH IN on the 
  BILLBOARD on the side of the road.  A happy girl, sunlit, on  
  a swing.  The PROMETHEUS LOG and the tagline:  What do we do?  
  What don t we do?  and our EERIE MUSIC BUILDS,  
  portending what s in store&

                                        ACT FOUR 
 
 
  FADE IN: 
 
 
The MUSIC CONTINUES as Olivia s car arrives  - 
 
 
  A TAXI pulls up to a glass and steel world headquarters 
  building, past 3D LETTERS WHICH READ,  NEW YORK CITY .   
  Olivia gets out of the cab, passes the company logo etched 
  massively in granite. 
 
 
  Olivia stands in the middle of a junkyard.  She looks around, 
  confused -- turns her head -- 
 
 
  BOOM DOWN a row of tenements -- past 3D LETTERS WHICH READ 
   SOUTH BOSTON  -  to a particularly shoddy one as a Flak-
  jacketed SWAT TEAM silently secures the perimeter, fanning  
out -- 
 
 
Peter and Walter sit in the back of Olivia s car.  Peter  
looks at the FILE of Stenson -  company PHOTO, etc&Then he  
  notices that Walter seems particularly uncomfortable watching  
the police activity. 
 
                                          PETER 
                      What.  You okay? 
 
He shakes his head a bit.  Vulnerable. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                        Reminds me& 
                              (then staring off, shakes his head) 
                        &nothing. 
 
Peter realizes: must be the night he was arrested.  The fire.  
  A beat, then he looks back to the team -- 
 
  VARIOUS SHOTS of Team Members snaking through bushes, around 
  corners -- cordoning off the apartment   moving up to the front 
door. 
 
TIGHT ON OLIVIA who lands next to the doorframe, back to the 
wall, gun drawn.  TEAM LEADER gives the  go  and: 
 
 
  Walter and Peter, alone.  Peter watching outside, anxious. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                      Thank you for before.  Putting me 
                      out.  When I was on fire.  
 
                                          PETER 
                              (I don t want to be here) 
                      My pleasure. 
 
                                          WALTER 
                              (beat) 
                      It s good to see you again. 
 
Peter look at him, not giving an inch.  Then he sees, past 
  Walter: STENSON emerge from a below-ground FLIGHT OF STAIRS -- 
Peter recognizes his FACE -- THROWS the car door open, starts 
to MOVE, SHOUTING: 
 
                                          PETER 
                      THE ALLEY!  HE S IN THE ALLEY! 
 
  Stenson TURNS -- MEETS EYES WITH Peter -- then RUNS around a 
  corner, down an alley   and fuck, Peter can t let him go so, as 
he gets out, quickly, to Walter  
 
                PETER (CONT D)     WALTER  
--YOU STAY RIGHT THERE, YOU    --what--I can t--can I 
HEAR ME?!     leave the car? 
  --NO!!!  NO, YOU STAY  
  THERE!!! 
 
And Peter SPRINTS after Stenson -- finally the SWAT team s 
  following too, IN PURSUIT -- OLIVIA sees Peter round a corner -
  - SHIT--she runs:  90

 
    A BREATHLESS FOOT CHASE, IMMEDIATE, HANDHELD AND FRENETIC: 
Peter and STENSON -- RUNNING ALL OUT -- pelting down the alley, 
  breathing hard, each in overdrive -- Stenson looks back -- sees 
Peter behind him, gaining-- 
 
Ahead of them a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley -- 
  Stenson hangs a hard left and CRASHES through a wooden gate -- 
Peter whips through the gate a second later, crossing a 
  cluttered BACKYARD -- RUNNING, tripping through toys, a swing 
  set, through a HEDGE and RUNNING LIKE MAD through the narrow 
gap between tenements -- they emerge onto a street -- 
 
  Ahead, a MAN on a BIKE, pulling up to the sidewalk -- Stenson 
  dodges but HURLS bike-man aside, sending him RIGHT INTO Peter -
- the two of them CRASHING, rolling to the pavement, Peter s 
face contorted with pain and just when it looks like Stenson s 
gonna get away -- 
 
OLIVIA SNAPS INTO FRAME, running full-tilt boogie, she s been 
  FOLLOWING THEM, suddenly the chase becomes HERS -- Stenson 
races toward a TRACT HOUSE across the street -- she pulls her 
gun as Stenson runs past a MAN picking up his mail -- RACES 
  THROUGH HIS FRONT DOOR: 
 
INSIDE THE HOUSE: Olivia chases -- a WOMAN doing laundry 
  SCREAMS as they blast past her, knocking her flying    
  through the KITCHEN   KIDS at the table SCREAM TOO as  
  furniture crashes everywhere -- Stenson SLAMS right through  
the back screen door, RIPPING IT off its hinges -- and JESUS, 
we re still following them across the BACKYARD where -- 
 
  A SNARLING DOBERMAN IS SUDDENLY BOLTING AFTER THEM -- gaining -
- a FENCE ahead -- Stenson s the first OVER IT -- Olivia 
  follows a second later but the DOG has TORE into her leg, she 
YELLS IN AGONY but manages to kick free of the dog and pulls 
  herself over the fence, ANKLE BLOODIED -- drops with a THUD  
on the other side just as she looks up to see Peter APPEAR  
OUT OF NOWHERE, TACKLING STENSON HARD -- SLAMMING HIM TO THE 
  OILY CONCRETE   DOGS BARKING, JUMPING behind nearby fences    
  a furious Peter gets the upper hand, PUNCHING STENSON HARD   
AGAIN AND AGAIN -- an adrenaline surge of strength and 
  Stenson s face BLEEDS for it -- but suddenly Olivia is THERE, 
SLAMS her knee down on Stenson s chest and shoves her GUN 
  BARREL in his face -- out of breath: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Hi there.  We ve got some questions  
                      for you. 
 
Off that we WHIP TO: 
  91

 
John, now back in his clothes, approaches the POSTED COP 
  outside Stenson s door, flashes his FBI ID: 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      Need to ask him a few questions&. 
 
 
  Charlie runs down the corridor -- flashes his badge as he moves 
past the COP outside Stenson s room -- he bursts in -- FINDS A 
  DEAD STENSON -- EYES WIDE-- 
 
                                        CHARLIE 
                      --oh God--Livvy, he s dead  
                      Stenson s dead! 
                              (yells out) 
                      WE NEED THIS PLACE LOCKED DOWN! 
 
 
  Olivia FISHTAILS around a corner -- SLAMMING HER BRAKES, door 
  already open and she s LEAPING from the car -- RUNNING LIKE 
  HELL FOR THE ENTRANCE -- but then she HEARS A SCREECH and turns  106

    John, behind the wheel of a BLACK SUV, pulls onto the road!  
  Olivia runs back to her car -- jumps in and TAKES OFF after 
him-- 
 
TIRES SCREAM AS SHE PURSUES, SHOUTING INTO HER CAR WALKIE: 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      This is Warren, Agent ID 52776--in pursuit of 
                      black SUV, license number 5AD672B -- heading 
                      south on Fenway, need immediate assist-- 
 
 
  JOHN -- speeding across the boulevard into a neighborhood of 
  inclined streets and  OLIVIA-- skidding around a corner a 
  second later as -- TWO POLIC ECARS PULL U-TURNS on the road, 
  whipping around to join the chase and John looks back -- SEES 
  OLIVIA IS PURSUING HIM -- 
 
  Pursued by Olivia and two black and whites, JOHN DRIVES, FAST 
up a hill-- CRESTS -- SPARK FLY as he SKIDS A HARD RIGHT  SHIT-
  -Another COPP CAR angels in from the SIDE STREET and JOHN -- no 
choice   FLOORS IT   KNIFING the front end of the cop car and -
- the TWO COPS CARS FOLLOWING are spun back!  CRASHING AGAINST 
  A BUILDING ON THE CORNER   not to mention the COMMUTER CARS -- 
  PILES-UP: 
 
OLIVIA -- swerving to avoid it -- onto the sidewalk--SPARKS 
FROMK THE WALL AS SHE SCRAPES!  Hanging in --- skidding into a 
turn down the hill, catching up--- 
 
JOHN -- pedal down   SIDE-SWIPES OLIVIA S CAR   THEY SKID INTO 
  ONCOMING LANES   A TRUCK!  They re forced to DIVIDE in a  V  as 
the truck PASSES INCHES BEWEEN THEM   John Veers off, onto the 
-- 
 
 
The two cars on a road running parallel to the Charles River -- 
the road itself divided by a CONCRETE BARRIER -- 
 
Olivia -- recovering   gaining -- nearly pulling level-- 
 
JOHN SWERVES INTO OLIVIA, TRYING TO RUN HER OFF THE ROAD-- 
  SLAMMING INTO HER CAR, AGAIN AND AGAIN! 
 
  ANOTHER SLAM AND HIS BUMPER LOCKS INTO HER FENDER -- HE TRIES 
TO STEER LOOSE BUT SHE HAS HIM NOW -- SHE ACCELERATES: 
 
  SPEEDOMETER: vibrating at 99mph&105mph&up ahead, CRASH DRUMS -- 
she SLAMS her brake, ripping loose, sending John s car 
  FISHTAILING OUT OF CONTROL--  107

 
HIS CAR CAREENS INTO THE DETONATING CRASH DRUMS, SMASHING INTO 
THE CONCRETE BARRIER, SOMERSAULTING OVER THE REINFORCED 
  EMBANKMENT IN A SPINE-SHATTERING COLLISION AND& 
 
  &quiet. Olivia SLAMS her brakes, SKIDDING to a stop. 
 
We stay CLOSE on her.  Eyes wide, in SHOCK.  HOLD for a long 
  beat&the insane turn of events barley registering through the 
  adrenaline screaming through her brain& 
 
  Finally, her eyes track up to the rear view, where she sees: 
the wreck sits motionless, smoke pouring from its hood. 
 
  Somewhere in there is John.  The man who, until minutes ago, 
she loved.  The man who just tried to kill her. 
 
  Weakly, she pushes open her dented door.  Pulls herself from 
the car&stumbles over the wreckage, terrified to face what 
  she ll see&and there he is: 
 
  Bloody, barely alive.  His body crushed, entombed in twisted 
  metal.  And the eerie translucent skin almost makes him look 
  like a vampire dying at dawn&he tries to speak, only GURGLES 
  BLOOD& 
 
Her eyes well, heart shredded, betrayed, watching him die.  And 
in his last breath, he manages to say& 
 
                                          JOHN 
                      &ask yourself&why& 
 
&eyes wet, in shock, she just stares& 
 
                                    JOHN (CONT D) 
                      &why Broyles&sent you&to  
                      the storage facility& 
                              (then) 
                      &why you? 
 
Her mind bends -- is he just fucking with her some more?!  Or 
  does he mean something by this? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      &I don t understand&why& 
                      who are you working for&? 
 
He COUGHS more blood, fading.  Manages to half-smile, sadly&her 
  eyes well, she s almost pleading& 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      Tell me, John. You tell me.  108

 
He just looks at her long and hard.  And then.  He dies. 
 
  Olivia just stands there, mind and heart a jumble, his last 
words echoing in her&holding the ugly promise of what she s 
found herself in the middle of&   
 
                                                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN:  
 
 
  Charlie s government   issued car DRIVES PAST. 
 
 
  Charlie s car pulls up -- Olivia gets out.  And she sees, 
across the parking lot, Walter and Peter getting into another 
black government vehicle as passengers.  They see her and stop. 
 
She moves to them.  A shell of her former self.  But somewhere 
-- visible even now -- is a strength forming as a result of 
  everything she just experienced. 
  110

She tries to appear normal in this moment.  Strong.  Better 
  than okay. 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      So, uh&I was thinking.  About  
                        everything.  About what we did.   
                      And what we re gonna do next. 
                              (beat) 
                      And I thought&given  
                        everything&that maybe not  
                        sticking together&maybe that s  
                      being a little selfish.

                        --what are you saying? 
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                      I m saying that the world s scary  
                      as hell.  And I don t like it.   
                              (beat) 
                      But if we can help...don t you  
                      think we have to?

                                          OLIVIA 
                      You re the only one who speaks  
                        Walter.  What if-- please -- what  
                      if&we take care of it?  What  
                        you&what you owe. 
 
And Jesus, Olivia is just desperate   and Peter can see it.  He 
stares at her-- a mix of suspicion and concern&and, 
    increasingly, heartbreak& 
 
                                          PETER 
                      &what happened?

                      &I just think it s the right  
                      thing to do. 
 
                                          PETER 
                        --where s John? 
 
And that s it: Olivia starts to cry-- and Peter moves to her--
takes her in his arms.  Holds her.  Not understanding--but at 
the same time, knowing --this is where he needs to be. And he 
says, quietly: 
 
                                    PETER (CONT D) 
                      Of course I ll stay.  Of course I  
                      will. 
 
And as he holds her, she just whispers  
 
                                          OLIVIA 
                        --thank you& 
 
                                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
