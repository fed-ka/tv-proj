    He s awake.  Wide awake.

                          ...usually...

    The fan s THRUPPING becomes the SOUND OF A HEART BEATING.  
    He puts his hand on his heart.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I ve got a hamster wheel spinning in

                        Morpheus.  Here we go.  

    He waits.  Fidgets.  Waits some more.

    A fully involved Homicide Scene.  Our cops doing their 
    thing.  Angry on-lookers staring them down.  

    DEXTER PARKS HIS GREY TAURUS next to a Fire Truck.  He gets 
    out with his kit, looks around.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Back in the belly of the beast.  
                        Little Chino s home turf.  Riskier 
                        than I d like...

    He pulls a Miami Metro cap low over his forehead.

                        But duty calls. 

    He scooches under the yellow perimeter tape.  BATISTA and 
    MASUKA fall into step.

                        needs is another serial killer.

    DEXTER KNEELS NEXT TO A BODY.  Batista raises the tarp.  
    It s EVA ARENAS (201).  Badly hacked-up.  Dexter can t help 
    but be a little fascinated.  Batista s disgusted.

    She goes off, anything but over that.  We follow her past 
    PASCAL in her car.  She s on the phone, in a seething 
    conversation.  LAGUERTA taps on her window.  Pascal lowers 
    it, clearly stressed.  Says into her cell --

    Dexter reacts.

                        So far authorities have no clue as to

                        to stay focussed.

    He looks off to a street corner where a group of Gang 
    Bangers hang.  Surly, smoking, drinking, staring back at 
    him.

    Suddenly, a ribbon of light bounces off his rearview and 
    slashes across his eyes.  Dexter adjusts the mirror.  As he 
    does, the trailing car s headlights go out.

                        don t have my tools, but... 

    He swerves into an alley, swings to a stop; blocking it.

                        ... it does give me the chance to tie 
                        up one massive loose end.  

    He grabs his Taser and a longneck Mag-light, jumps out and 
    strides toward the trailing car as it screeches up.  Dexter 
    hefts the Mag-light, about to demolish the driver s window,

    Dexter sits at his meticulously uncluttered desk, watching 
    news video of the body recovery process on his laptop.

    And she s gone.  Dexter picks up the OJ.  It left a ring on

    Lundy heads for his office, LaGuerta and Doakes exchange a

    Dexter, looking like hell after his night in hell, hustles 
    toward his front door.  He s covered in dirt and grime.

    Rita, wearing a simple black dress, comes from around the

    HE UNFURLS HIS FINGERS and there s... the Barbie head.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        ... with what s really important... 
                        with who I was...

    He inserts a lead fishing sinker into the Barbie head.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        ... with who I have to be.

    He drops the Barbie head into the water.  Then he leans over 
    to watch it sink, making sure.  All is right in his world.

    SUDDENLY A HAND ERUPTS OUT OF THE WATER AND GRABS DEXTER S 
    WRIST.  A fearsome deep sea predator.  

    BRIAN S FACE COMES INTO VIEW JUST BELOW THE SURFACE.  He 
    struggles to pull Dexter into the water.

    ON DEXTER.  Everything about him as tranquil as the still 
    waters of Miami Bay.  He offers a tolerant smile to Brian.  

                                        DEXTER
                        Rest in peace... I am.

    AND HE RIPS HIS HAND OUT OF HIS BROTHER S GRASP.  BRIAN, 
    rejected for the last time, slips away.  

    DEXTER LEANS OVER THE RAIL.  HIS POV:

    THE BARBIE HEAD.  Staring back at us as it goes down, down.  
    Until, slowly, the darkness takes it.

                                                                    SMASH TO BLACK.

                                        THE END
