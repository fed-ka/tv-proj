               Stan, Kyle and Kenny are waiting for the bus.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, the bus will be here any minute 
                         and Cartman didn't show up for school.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, this is like the third day in 
                         a row. I wonder what's wrong.

                                     KENNY
                         Mph rmph rm rmph rm.

               The boys all laugh.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah!

                                     STAN
                         Hey, maybe we should ditch school 
                         and go check on him.

               But just then, the school bus pulls up.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE!!!

                                     STAN
                         We're not getting on, you fat, ugly 
                         bitch.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

                                     STAN
                         I said 'We're not getting on, you 
                         fat ugly bitch'.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Oh, alright then.

               Ms. Crabtree closes the door and drives away.

                                     KYLE
                         Woa, dude!!

                                     STAN
                         I always wondered if that would work.


               The boys walk up to Cartman's door and knock. Cartman's mother 
               answers.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Hello, boys!

                                     KYLE
                         Hi, we were wondering why fat ass -- 
                         I mean, Cartman -- hasn't been showing 
                         up for school.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Oh, he's just been feeling under the 
                         weather. Maybe you boys can cheer 
                         him up. He's in the back yard.

               The boys look at each other suspiciously.

                                     STAN
                         In the back yard?


               It's a nice little yard. Cartman is sitting at a small, 
               rectangular table covered with a white tablecloth. Cartman 
               is at the head of the table, serving tea with an adorable 
               little plastic tea set.

               Also seated at the table, are five of Cartman's stuffed 
               animals, one in each chair, and each with a little teacup 
               and saucer in front of them.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Would you like some more tea, Polly 
                         Prissy Pants?

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Polly voice)
                         Yes, Eric, I would love some tea, 
                         thank you.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You're very welcome, Polly 
                         Prissypants.

               Unbeknownst to Cartman, the boys sneak in from behind some 
               bushes. They can't believe what they see.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Frog voice)
                         Yes, please. Eric, why are you so 
                         cool?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, I don't know, Clyde Frog, I just 
                         am.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Polly voice)
                         You are so strong and smart, Eric. 
                         Everybody likes you.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Why thank you, Polly Prissypants, 
                         how nice of you.

               The boys stay hidden in the bushes.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, this is pretty fucked up right 
                         here.

                                     KENNY
                              (Laughing)

                                     KYLE
                         Come on! Let's go make fun of him!!

               Stan grabs Kyle, stopping him.

                                     STAN
                         No, dude... This looks really serious. 
                         I think we better get help.

                                     KYLE
                         Really?

               Cartman pours tea for a large, stuffed Panda.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Panda voice)
                         Wow, Eric, you are the coolest guy 
                         in the world. This is tremendous 
                         tea!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Why thank you, Peter Panda, It's a 
                         distinctive Earl Grey.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Polly voice)
                         Eric is the best!

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Frog voice)
                         Hooray for Eric!

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Panda voice)
                         Eric Kicks ass!


               Establishing.


               Cartman is sitting at his cute little table.

                                     CARTMAN
                         My goodness that's a lovely dress 
                         you are wearing, Polly Prissypants.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Polly voice)
                         Oh, thank you, Eric, you are a perfect 
                         gentleman. And you are smart and 
                         cool.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Panda voice)
                         Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart 
                         and cool. Everybody likes you very 
                         much.

                                     CARTMAN
                         That' nice, Peter Panda...

               Meanwhile, the boys are in the distance, with the camcorder 
               on a tripod, trying hard not to laugh.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, this is gonna be the funniest 
                         tape ever made!

                                     KYLE
                         How much do you think Mr. Mackey 
                         needs?

                                     STAN
                         I dunno, just keep rolling.

               Cartman continues, unaware of the video camera.

                                     CARTMAN
                         More tea, Rumper Tumpskin?

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Tumpskin voice)
                         Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and 
                         handsome.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Thank you, Rumper Tumpskin. And what 
                         do you think about me, Clyde Frog?

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Frog voice)
                         I think you're a big, fat piece of 
                         crap.

               Cartman thinks for a minute.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY!!!


               The sun goes down in South Park. Passage of time.


               A large barn with a banner that reads 'Twelfth Annual Drunken 
               Barn Dance'.

               From inside, music, screaming, laughing and crashing can be 
               heard.



               A NATIVE AMERICAN man walks up to a campfire, where several 
               other Utes are sitting.

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         ...And Bear cried to Eagle...

                                     NATIVE AMERICAN
                         Running Water, there's some kid here 
                         to see you.

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         What kid?

                                     NATIVE AMERICAN
                         He claims to be YOUR kid.

               Just then, Cartman walks up, wearing all kinds of Indian 
               garb.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hi, dad!

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you 
                         put your Who-Who Dilly in her Cha-
                         Cha at the drunken barn dance.

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         Your mother?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Liane Cartman.

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         CARTMAN?!
                              (Laughing)
                         Oh, boy I was worried there for a 
                         second!! Look, kid, I'm not your 
                         father.

                                     CARTMAN
                         But my mom said YOU were the guy she 
                         was with.

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         Kid, I hate to break this to you, 
                         but your mother is what we Native 
                         Americans refer to as 'Bear with 
                         wide canyon'.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What do you mean?

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         She is 'Doe who cannot keep legs 
                         together'.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Huh?

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         Your mom's a slut.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY!

                                     CHIEF RUNNING WATER
                         Don't feel too bad, your mom was 
                         just too drunk to remember what 
                         happened. Let me tell you...


               We are again outside the drunken barn dance.


                                     CARTMAN
                         His TONGUE?! CHEF?! Chef is my dad?!

                         He's the last person I saw with your 
                         mom that night.

                                     CARTMAN

               Stan, Kyle and Kenny are hanging out at the busstop with a 
               little go-cart.

               Kenny is pulling at the lawn-mower type engine, trying to 
               get it to start.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, I mailed it last night. What 
                         sucks it that now we'll have to 
                         actually watch that Bob Saget guy to 
                         find out if we won.

                                     KYLE
                         If we win, we can buy a NEW go-cart 
                         that actually RUNS!

                                     STAN
                         Shh! Here comes Cartman!

               Cartman walks up, wearing all kinds of black hip hop street 
               garb and sporting a large afro.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ssup, homies?

                                     STAN
                         Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I was just down in the SPC kicking 
                         it with some G's on the west side.

                                     KYLE
                         You live on the EAST side, Cartman!

                                     STAN
                         Dude, I thought you said you were 
                         Native American.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, right. Like I'm some hippy Indian! 
                         You know what I'm sayin'? Check you 
                         later, I'm gonna go chill with my 
                         dad.

               Cartman walks off.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, we should be videotaping THIS! 
                         We could make ANOTHER ten thousand 
                         dollars!

               Just then, Kenny manages to get the go cart running. It takes 
               off at an amazing speed! Kenny is dragged behind it, holding 
               desperately onto the cord.

                                     STAN AND KYLE
                         HOLD ON KENNY!!!

               The go-cart runs wild up and down the street, though the 
               trees, Kenny being dragged and beaten to a bloody pulp. 
               Finally, after horrible bounces and bumps, the go-cart comes 
               to a stop.

               Kenny manages to slowly sit up. He waves to Stan and Kyle. 
               He appears okay.

                                     KENNY
                         Mrph mfrr mphr.

               Until a train runs him over going seventy.

                                     STAN
                         Oh my God!! They've killed Kenny!!

                                     KYLE
                         YOU BASTARDS!!!


               Cartman knocks on the door. Chef answers.

                                     CHEF
                         Hello?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yo, pops.

               Cartman is standing there with his afro.

                                     CHEF
                         Boy, what the fudge are you doing?!

                                     CARTMAN
                         You know, just laying down some rhymes 
                         for my G-folk. You know what I'm 
                         saying?

                                     CHEF
                         Get in here!

                                     CARTMAN
                         West side!

               Chef grabs Cartman by the arm and yanks him into his house.


               Same old establishing shot. Loud noises and music inside.


                                     STAN
                         Dude, I can't wait to win that ten 
                         thousand dollars on America's 
                         stupidest home videos! I'm gonna buy 
                         the coolest go-cart ever!

                                     KYLE
                         I'm gonna buy a walkman with MY half!

               Cartman walks up, with his head down.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Very slow and sad)
                         Hey guys.

                                     STAN
                         How's it going, Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh... Fine. How are you guys?

               The boys can't believe how mellow and normal Cartman is.

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, what the hell is wrong with 
                         you?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, nothing, it's just -- Nothing...

                                     STAN
                         Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, I want to know who my dad is. 
                         But to find out, they have to do 
                         these DNA tests, and that costs three 
                         thousand dollars. I don't have three 
                         thousand dollars...

               Stan and Kyle look at each other.

                                     STAN
                         Wow, We're sorry your mom's a whore, 
                         dude!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who 
                         my father is. I just have to. Maybe 
                         I could work at a sweat shop for a 
                         while... Well, see you guys, I'm 
                         gonna go play in my back yard for a 
                         while...

               Now Stan and Kyle look really guilty.

                                     KYLE
                         Uh... Cartman, we know how we can 
                         get you three thousand dollars.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You do?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah... We have a videotape that's 
                         in the finals for America's Stupidest 
                         Home Videos... And... And if we win, 
                         we'll GIVE you three thousand of our 
                         ten thousand dollar prize!

                                     CARTMAN
                         You will?! WOW!! You guys are the 
                         BEST!!! THANKS, YOU GUYS!!

                                     STAN
                         Uh... Yeah.



               Establishing.
