      Fingers wrap through and around the worn threads in the net 
      of a LACROSSE STICK. Backpack at his feet, an unusually 
      pensive Stiles absentmindedly tightens the knots on the head 
      of the stick.

                                  STILES
                    You know, when you re drowning, you 
                    don t actually inhale until right 
                    before you re about to black out. 
                    It s called voluntary apnea.


      Stiles pulls a knot on the lacrosse stick tighter and 
      tighter.

                                  STILES
                    It s like no matter how much you re 
                    freaking out, the instinct to not 
                    let water in is so strong, you 
                    won t open your mouth until you 
                    feel like your head s exploding.


      Stiles glances up to Ms. Morrell.

                                  STILES
                    I don t feel sorry for him.

                                    MORRELL
                    Can you feel sorry for the nine 
                    year-old Matt who drowned?

                                  STILES
                    Just because a bunch of dumbasses 
                    dragged him into a pool when he 
                    couldn t swim doesn t mean he s 
                    allowed to kill them off one-by-
                    one. And, by the way, my dad said 
                    they found pictures of Allison on 
                    his computer. Not just her. Matt 
                      Photoshopped himself into them. 
                    Stuff like them holding hands and 
                    kissing. Like he d built this whole 
                    fake relationship. So drowning 
                    might have sent him off the rails, 
                    but the dude was definitely riding 
                    the crazy train.


      Stiles s eyes focus on the threads of the lacrosse stick.

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, but it still feels like 
                    there s something wrong between us. 
                    Like there s this tension whenever 
                    we talk. Same thing with Scott.

                                    MORRELL
                    Have you talked to him since that 
                    night?                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/123.

                    Not really. He s got his own 
                    problems to deal with...


      Pulling a new hoodie out of a Macy s shopping bag, Scott 
      slips it on and then grabs his backpack. When he steps into 
      the hallway, he hears a door CLICK closed.

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom?

      Approaching her door, he leans in to listen. Unable to see 
      her standing on the other side, he can still hear the BEATING 
      of her heart.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Mom? We re going to have to talk 
                    about this eventually.

      Melissa puts her hand on the knob. But can t seem to turn it.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Okay. I m going. Love you.

      He holds still, hand at the door, fingers lightly touching it 
      as if trying to make some kind of contact with his mother. 

      Finally, he turns to leave while Melissa gently rests her 
      cheek against the door, listening to his receding FOOTSTEPS.


      Morrell cocks her head, trying to gauge Stiles s reactions 
      through the netting of the lacrosse stick. 

                                  STILES
                    No, I m pretty sure he hasn t 
                    talked to Allison either. But 
                    that s more her choice, I think.


      Allison shuts off the ignition. Then pauses before getting 
      out. Hesitantly, she breathes on the window, steaming it up 
      to reveal a message from Scott: 12pm. 

      Beneath it he s written one word in caps: PLEASE. 

      Gathering her sleeve into her fist, Allison reluctantly wipes 
      away the message. From the look on her face, it s clear she 
      has no plan to meet him.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/124.

                    Her mom dying hit her really hard. 
                    But I guess it kind of brought her 
                    and her dad closer.


      Surrounded by weapons in the basement, Allison watches Argent 
      use a RED MARKER to cross off a section on a MAP OF BEACON 
      HILLS. Several other areas are already crossed out. 

      Underneath the red slashes lies one location yet to be

      Morrell watches Stiles closely from behind her desk.

                    Feeling any anxiety about the

      Stiles looks up. He has one of the threads on the lacrosse 
      stick clenched between his teeth.

                    I m fine. Except for the not 
                    sleeping. The jumpiness. And this 
                    constant, overwhelming, crushing 
                    fear that something incredibly 
                    terrible is going to happen.

                                    MORRELL
                    It s called hyper-vigilance. The

                    Then think about something Winston 
                    Churchill once said: If you re 
                    going through hell... keep going.

      He reaches up to the mirror to wipe away the steam. But then 
      pauses, turning his head to listen. All he hears, however, is 
      the TRICKLE of water.

      Scott swipes at the mirror to reveal his face. Running a hand 
      through his hair, he turns around and steps out of the 
      bathroom to find--

      A PAIR OF FEET hanging several inches off the floor.

      Melissa stares down at him in terror, fingers grasping at the 
      TAIL wrapped around her neck which holds her almost a foot 
      off the floor. 

      Perched in the corner between the ceiling and the walls 
      above, the Kanima stares defiantly at Scott.

      Only few a feet away, Gerard sits in the reclining chair,

                    I didn t just come here to bury my 
                    daughter. I came to avenge her.

      The Kanima whips its tail free of Melissa s neck, letting her 
      drop to the floor. Scott rushes to her side as she coughs for 
      air. When he looks up again, he glimpses the Kanima s tail 
        disappearing out the top of the doorway, Gerard following. 

      Alone with his mother, Scott finds her still breathless, but 
      also looking back at him with frightened eyes.

      another from a shelf inside the Hale House, desperately *
      searching and discarding book after book. He pauses. Then *
      turns to find Erica and Boyd by the stairwell.*

                                  DEREK*
                    You decided.*

      Erica nods.*

                    When?

                                  ERICA
                    Tonight.

                                  BOYD*
                      Everyone s going to be at the game. 
                    We figured it was the best time.

                                  ERICA
                    It s not like we want to.

                                  DEREK
                    What do you want?

                                  ERICA
                    Since I just turned sixteen a month 
                    ago, I wouldn t mind getting my 
                    license. I can t do that if I m 
                    dead, you know.

                                  DEREK
                    I told you there was a price.

                                  BOYD
                    You didn t tell us it was going to 
                    be like this.

                                  DEREK
                    But I did tell you how to survive. 
                    You do it as a pack. And you re 
                    only a pack with an Alpha.

      Derek lowers a book and turns his gaze on Boyd. Despite his *
      size, Boyd can t hold Derek s stare for long. And it s the 
      turning away that makes Derek understand.

                                  DEREK
                    You re going to look for another 
                    pack.

      They confirm it with their silence.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    How are you even going to find one?

                                  BOYD
                    We think we already did.


      A TINY DROP OF LIQUID slips off the tip of a NEEDLE. Deaton 
      sets the automatic syringe on a tray by the examining table 
      where a sick DOG lies.

      The front door CHIMES, catching his attention.

                                  DEATON
                    Would you mind seeing who that is?

      Scott glances up from the counter where he operates a 
      MEDICATION CAPSULE FILLING MACHINE.

      Deaton notices the dog on the table WHIMPERING. In the back, 
      other DOGS can be heard BARKING louder and louder, as if 
      responding to the new presence in the clinic.

      Deaton glances to Scott who shares his uneasy look. They 
      slowly move to peer out to the waiting room where--

      Isaac gazes down on the GATE made from mountain ash, afraid 
      to approach it.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    It s all right, Isaac. We re open.


      Derek listens with skepticism to Erica s explanation.

                                  ERICA
                    And all of a sudden we hear this 
                    howling. It was unbelievable.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1213.

                                  BOYD
                    There must have been a dozen of 
                    them.

                                  ERICA
                    Maybe more.

                                  DEREK
                    Or maybe only two. You know what 
                    the Beau Geste effect is? If they 
                    modulate their howls with a rapid 
                    shift in tone, two wolves can sound 
                    like twenty.

      Erica and Boyd look to each other, both uncertain now.

                                  ERICA
                    It doesn t matter. There s another 
                    pack out there. There s got to be. 
                    We ve made up our minds.

                                  BOYD
                    We lost, Derek. It s over. We re 
                    leaving.

                                  DEREK
                    You re running. And once you start, 
                    you don t stop. You ll always be 
                    running.

      Derek returns to searching the books and doesn t bother to *
      look back as Erica takes Boyd s hand to lead him out.*

      When their footsteps have faded, Derek lets his weary eyes *
      close with a regret-filled sigh. But then--HIS EYES SNAP 
      OPEN.

      Grabbing a PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS, Derek whips around, tossing *
      the shard like a throwing knife and--*

      Peter Hale catches it just before it goes into his throat.*

                                  PETER
                    I was hoping for a slightly warmer 
                    welcome than that. But...

      He turns the shard of glass around, tip facing up.*

      Isaac watches Scott gently hold the dog still on the 
      examining table while Deaton administers a shot from the 
      automatic syringe.

      Leaning forward, Isaac crinkles up his nose in disgust.

                                  ISAAC
                    Why does it smell like that?

      Scott and Deaton share a smile.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  DEATON
                    Scott said almost the exact same 
                    thing to me a few months ago. One 
                    day he could somehow tell which 
                    animals were getting better and 
                    which were not.

                                  ISAAC
                          (eyeing the dog)
                    He s not getting better, is he?

      Deaton shakes his head. The dog WHINES softly.

                                  DEATON
                      Osteosarcoma.

                    Cancer?

                                  DEATON
                    It s a very distinct scent, isn t 
                    it? Come here.

      Scott gives Isaac a nod as if to say it ll be okay.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    I think you re pretty aware of what 
                    your new abilities can do for you. 
                    But have you ever wondered what 
                    they can do for others? Give me 
                    your hand.

      Isaac cautiously holds his hand out for Deaton. The vet takes 
      it and gently places it on the dying animal.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1215.

      CONTINUED:2121

      Hesitant, Isaac pets the dog. Almost immediately, the animal 
      stops whining. Its breathing slows, body calming as Isaac 
      strokes the back of its head.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    You know petting a dog releases 
                    serotonin in our brains? In the 
                    dog s brain the primary chemical is 
                    oxytocin. But that s when a human 
                    pets it. Someone like you or Scott 
                    can have a different effect.

      Then, with widening eyes, Isaac pauses to raise his free 
      hand. The VEINS on it have darkened considerably. Teeth 
      clenched in pain, Isaac squeezes his hand into a fist and 
      watches it return to normal.

      Astonished, he peers down at the dog which rests far more 
      easily now while affectionately nuzzling Isaac s other hand.

                                  ISAAC
                    What was that?

                                  SCOTT
                    You took some of his pain.

                                  DEATON
                    Just a little bit. But sometimes a 
                    little can make quite a difference.

      When Isaac looks up again, his eyes are glistening.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s okay. First time he showed me, 
                    I cried too.

      Then Isaac does something he rarely ever does. He laughs.


      Derek watches Peter approach.*

      FADE IN:


      Amid the players hurrying to get ready for the game, Jackson 
      quietly pulls his pads on. His movements are slow and 
      strangely purposeful.

                                  DANNY
                    You okay, dude?

                    Well, we all knew that. But are you

                    week. I m getting kind of worried 
                    about you. Jackson.

      He blinks at the sound of his name, looking at the lacrosse 
      stick in his hands as if not quite sure how it got there. 
      Then a kind of brief understanding seems to come to him.

                                    JACKSON

      His last words echo across the room to another locker where 
      Scott uses his elevated hearing to listen in on the 
      unsettling exchange.

      While pulling his pads on, he doesn t notice his mother, 
      Melissa, peering in at the door. She glances about, trying to 
      find him among the other players. But then Coach BANGS his 
      clipboard against a locker.

                                  COACH
                    Good morning.

      The team quiets. Melissa glances up, confused since it s 
      clearly nighttime.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1220.

                    In less than an hour, aircraft from 
                    here will join others from around 
                    the world and you will be launching 
                    the largest aerial battle in the 
                    history of mankind. 

      Melissa blinks, now very confused.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Mankind. That word should have new 
                    meaning for all of us today. We 
                    can t be consumed by our petty 
                      differences anymore. We will be 
                    united in our common interests.

      Melissa glances around to see if anyone else is confused.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Perhaps it s fate that today is the 
                    fourth of July--

                                  COACH
                    And you will once again be fighting 
                    for our freedom. Not from tyranny, 
                      oppression, or persecution, but 
                    from annihilation.

      The team CHEERS. Melissa leans over to the nearest player, 
      Stiles, and whispers to him as Coach continues.

                                    MELISSA

                    of July will no longer be known as 
                    an American holiday, but as the day 
                    when the world declared: We will 
                    not go quietly into the night!

                                  STILES
                    It s Coach s favorite movie.

                                  STILES
                    I don t think he cares.

                    We re going to live on! We re going 
                    to survive! Today, we celebrate our 
                      Independence Day!

      The team EXPLODES IN CHEERS. Melissa sees her chance to grab 
      Scott s attention. But just as she starts forward, Stiles 
      puts a hand on her arm, stopping her.

                                  GERARD
                    Well spoken, Coach.

      Gerard steps in, gently clapping his hands.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    I might have chosen something with 
                    a little more historical value but 
                    there s no denying your passion. 
                    And while I haven t been here long, 
                    there s no denying my pride in 
                    having a winning team for this

                    brilliant tonight, even with only 
                    one Co-Captain leading you.

      Scott blinks in surprise. He looks to Coach who noticeably 
      averts his gaze.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Now, I m your principal, but also a

                    field!

      With a flurry of CHEERS, the team charges out. As he moves to 
      follow, Gerard aims a baleful smile at Scott. He turns to 
      face Coach.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you benching me?

                    But I have to play.

                    to let me play.

                                  COACH
                    Not tonight, McCall. Tonight you re 
                    on the bench.


      Peter SLAMS back against a wall. GASPING, he staggers *
      forward, nearly crumbling to his knees.

                                  PETER
                    Okay, I probably deserved that.

      Derek punches him right in the face, sending him sprawling 
      across the floor.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Now we re bordering on excessive.

      Lifting him up, Derek slams him against the stairs.*

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    All right, can we hit pause on the 
                    rampant brutality for a second? I 
                    mean, you don t actually think I 
                    want to be Alpha again, do you?

      Derek pulls his fist back to hit him again.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Okay, fine. Do it. Hit me. Hit me 
                    all you want. I can tell it s 
                      cathartic. You re getting out the 
                    rage, the self-loathing, all of the 
                    anger that comes with total and 
                    complete failure. I may be the one 
                    taking a beating, but you ve 
                    already been beaten. So go ahead 
                    and hit me if it makes you feel 
                    better. After all, I did say I 
                    wanted to help.

      Lips bloody, Peter bravely lifts his chin for the next hit. 
      But Derek slowly lowers his fist and lets him go.

                                  DEREK
                    You can t help me.


      Glancing at his reflection in one of the mirrors, Peter blots *
      his bloody lip while a cautious Derek watches him.*

                                  PETER
                    See? Prime example right here. I m 
                    not healing as fast. Coming back 
                    from the dead isn t easy, you know. 
                    I m not as strong. I need a pack. I 
                    need an Alpha like you. I need you 
                    just as much as you need me.

                                  DEREK
                    Why would I want help from a total

                    First of all, I m not a total

      He cautiously approaches Derek, inching closer and closer.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    We need each other. And sometimes 
                    when you need help, you turn to 
                    people you never expected to...


      Derek sits on the stairs, head low as he peers up at Peter *
      giving his most empathetic smile.

                                  GERARD (V.O.)
                    Don t you know what you re really 
                      bargaining for, Scott?


      The stretcher that carried Isaac clatters to the floor. Half 
      paralyzed, the boy tries to crawl his way to the door, hands 
      digging at the cement floor.

      Behind him, an amused HUNTER watches him struggle to escape 
      while a SECOND hands Gerard the sheathed LONG SWORD used to 
      bisect the Omega.

                                  GERARD
                    It was a good effort, Isaac. It 
                    was.

      He slowly unsheathes the sword, eyeing its frighteningly 
      sharp edge as it glints in the moonlight.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    This would be so much more poetic 
                    if it were halftime.

      Gerard pulls the sword back, preparing to swing.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      Peter closes in on Derek, dropping the sardonic tone for 
      urgency.

                                  PETER
                    You tried to build your pack. You 
                    tried to prepare for the worst. But 
                    you weren t ready. And because of 
                    it, Gerard s winning. Now he s 
                    taking his time. Toying with Scott. 
                    Going after your wolves one-by-one. 
                    Relishing his victory.

                                  DEREK
                    How about you tell me something I 
                    don t know?

                                  PETER
                    I m going to. And it ll prove why 
                    you should trust me. Why you need 
                    to trust me. Because I m going to 
                    tell you how to stop Jackson.

      Derek looks up. Now Peter has his full attention.

                                  DEREK
                    What do you mean? How to kill him?

                                  PETER
                      Actually... how to save him.


      Sword raised, with his hunters behind him, Gerard approaches 
      Isaac who manages to pull himself to his feet. Back to a 
      locker, the boy turns to face them, defiance in his eyes. And 
      then...

      Isaac gives him the slightest of smiles. And for a brief 
      moment, Gerard s confident veneer cracks ever-so-slightly.

      Slowly, he turns back to his hunters. Neither of whom notice 
      the GLOWING-EYED Scott McCall rising behind them.


      The First Hunter flies across the locker room, SMASHING INTO 
      THE TILE WALL OF THE SHOWER.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 211" BLUE 4/6/1240.

      The Second SLAMS DOWN onto one of the wood benches, SPLITTING 
      IT IN HALF.

      Clawed hand on the back of the hunter, a still human Scott 
      snaps his head up with fangs bared. He sees Isaac slumped 
      against a locker. But Gerard is gone.

                                  SCOTT
                    Where is he?


      Derek now listens closely to Peter.*

                                  PETER
                    There s a myth that you can cure a

                                  DEREK
                    And that s just a myth.

                                  PETER
                    But sometimes myths and legends 
                    bear a hint of truth. Our name is a 
                    symbol of who we are. The Kanima 
                    has no identity. Which is why it 
                    doesn t seek a pack.

                                  DEREK
                    It seeks a master.

                    identity is disappearing underneath 
                      a reptilian skin. You have to bring

                    Lydia.


      Peter stares Derek dead in the eyes, speaking with greater *
      and greater urgency.

                                  PETER
                    Your best ally has always been 
                    anger, Derek. But the thing you 
                    lack most is a heart. It s why 
                    you ve always known you need Scott 
                    more than anyone. And even someone 
                    as burned and dead on the inside as 
                    me knows better than to 
                      underestimate the simple but 
                      undeniable power of human love.
