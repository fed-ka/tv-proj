CORNFIELD - DUSK
CORNSTALKS as far as the eye can see, rustling in a summer
breeze. FIGURES are moving within the FIELD. We only make
them out in SILHOUETTE, but all carry HEAVY RIFLES.
CORNFIELD - DUSK
THE FIGURES in the corn look up-- we hear an AIRCRAFT
APPROACH with a JET WHINE--
FWOOM! A MASSIVE CONCUSSION as a BUNKER-BUSTING MISSILE
BORES into the earth at high-velocity, burrowing deep--
--then a HUGE BLAST - FLAME and DIRT are thrown high in the
air, many of the FIGURES blown sky-high.
A FLAMING BODY hits the ground IN FG, FACE TO CAMERA... we
now see it was a STEEL TERMINATOR-- its METAL SKULL BLOWN
OPEN and SCORCHED, its RED EYES SHATTERED.
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
A-10 WARTHOGS-- stubby attack planes-- SCREAM from the sky,
RAKING THE REMAINING FIGURES with CANNON FIRE, BLASTING THEM
to bits. These aircraft no longer bear traditional U.S.
insignia-- they're painted in WILD COLORS, graffiti lettering
says things like: "BOT BLASTER," "KILL FOR CONNOR," "RAGE
AGAINST THE MACHINES," etc... Resistance fighters.
Motley military and civilian CHOPPERS LAND in the CORNFIELD,
disgorging RESISTANCE SOLDIERS. These are human troops in
high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional
ASSAULT WEAPONS.
THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind
the SOLDIERS. The troops run toward--
--AN OPENING which has been blown into the ground, the
remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker-buster hit.
A surviving TERMINATOR rises from the SINGED CORN, FIRES its
PLASMA RIFLE--
--DROPPING A SOLDIER. His comrades FIRE EXPLOSIVE BULLETS--
and BLOW THE ROBOT APART. The LEADER of this assault group
waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway.
CORNFIELD - NIGHT
A huge ESCAPE SHIP rises straight up from an open HATCHWAY.
Nearby TROOPS crouch and FIRE after it. THE SHIP PIVOTS in
mid-air and ROARS OFF, SOLDIERS dodging the ENGINE BLAST.
CORNFIELD - NIGHT
WIDE - AN IMMENSE SUBTERRANEAN BLAST causes a few hundred
yards square to SWELL and then COLLAPSE.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
JETS of FLAME, SMOKE and DIRT RISE in the aftermath.
CORNFIELD - NIGHT
SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.
IN FG, FIND the STEEL SKULL of the dead TERMINATOR.
DISSOLVE TO:
CORNFIELD - DAY
SAME ANGLE-- the TERMINATOR now half-sunk in mud. A FIELD
MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from
RAINDROPS.
Months have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a
black stubble. RAIN falls.
A PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving.
The MUD
roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE...
EYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so
drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure
rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud
from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth,
makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS.
CAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE...
CUT TO:
8.
PLATEAU - EVENING
BARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a
slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on
his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he
sees in the distance--
A DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble.
DEAD CITY - NIGHT
MOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground,
partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a
rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN.
MOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed,
faded sign: "BEWARE OF DOG."
WIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS--
rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted,
windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell.
MARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this
block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips.
A COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up
a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands.
A HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind
the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket.
MARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a
cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER.
MARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears
open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his
lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame.
He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush,
feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly
disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away.
He rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a
clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken
glass: "SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
9.
DEAD CITY - DAY
BLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the
dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK.
A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT.
MARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her
expression recalls the beckoning vision.
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
He runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a
chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he
carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds
the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on.
HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Deserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels.
MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT
NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're
in mostly flat, treeless plains.
From the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through
the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the
first living creatures he's seen. He waves.
MARCUS
Hey!
Yo, over here!
The FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison.
MARCUS (cont'd)
Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt
like I was the last man on...
He freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T-
400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA
RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but
their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and
motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan
him.
MARCUS (cont'd)
Oh God...
Marcus backs away, runs.
The T-400s stare after him-- but
don't fire.
ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's
worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE:
BOY
Hey mister, where you goin' in such
a hurry?
ANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid
teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
He wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING.
He
scrambles quickly down from the sign.
AT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the
freeway, when--
THE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in
one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other.
BOY (cont'd)
Whoah, whoah-- hang on there.
Got
any food?
Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head.
The boy looks him
over dubiously.
BOY (cont'd)
You look like you been eating
pretty good.
The boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus
with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.
MARCUS
You're human... you can see me, you
can touch me. This place is real.
THE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS
from Marcus' pocket.
MARCUS (cont'd)
I thought I was in hell.
BOY
(raises an eyebrow)
This sure ain't heaven.
MARCUS
Those things with masks, red eyes--
BOY
(CASUALLY)
Terminators-- T-400s.
What is this stuff?
THE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT--
ANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a
fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of
a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED: (2)
THE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with
sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it
hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the
gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.
MARCUS
If I'm not in hell, where am I?!
BOY
(CHOKING)
Texas!
The NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS--
MARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into
the boy's cheek. He's face to face with--
A GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the
shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot.
GIRL
Let him go!
MARCUS
First put down the shotgun.
THE GIRL shakes her head angrily.
She wears an aged, beloved
BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it.
BOY
Do what he says.
GIRL
He'll kill us both!
MARCUS
I don't wanna kill anyone.
BOY
Do it, Star. Put it down.
She shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus'
head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.
GIRL
There was only one bullet in that gun.
MARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly--
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED: (3)
--BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg,
she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. MARCUS tosses the BOY
at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun
falling to one side--
MARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun.
Using SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from
her clothing.
MARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand.
He
struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.
MARCUS
I don't like it when people point
guns at me.
GIRL
It wasn't loaded.
MARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and
handgun-- indeed, both are empty.
MARCUS
You took on a guy like me with one
bullet and an empty shotgun?
(studies them admiringly)
Pretty stupid.
He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and
kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught
FIRE and are incinerated.
THE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus.
GIRL
Can I have my gun back?
MARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up.
He still
looks at the PICTURES in his hands.
GIRL (cont'd)
Where'd you get those?
MARCUS
In the city.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED: (4)
BOY
(steps away from him)
The city? Oh man. That place is
red hot.
MARCUS
(a small smile)
Seemed kinda dead to me.
BOY
No-- radiation.
A SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER
moving in their direction.
Quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL
OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger.
THE BOY bolts from behind cover, grabs MARCUS by the arm--
BOY (cont'd)
Get down, they've seen the light!
He drags Marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time--
As the H-K nears, the LIGHT FINDS the BURNING OIL. It FIRES
BLUE PULSES, which CHEW up the asphalt nearby-- then it moves
on, failing to pick out the humans. Marcus is dumbfounded.
MARCUS
That wasn't a helicopter...
BOY
It's an H-K-- hunter-killer.
Where
the hell have you been?
GIRL
Rads musta fried his brains.
Let's
go, Kyle.
The H-K has vanished in the distance. The girl rises.
The
boy-- KYLE-- shakes his head, stays at Marcus' side.
KYLE
What's your name?
MARCUS
(after a beat)
Marcus. Marcus Wright.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED: (5)
KYLE
Kyle Reese.
(indicates girl)
She doesn't remember her name--
(re: her cap)
--so I call her Star.
STAR gives Marcus a small, reluctant wave.
KYLE (cont'd)
Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better
find cover. We spotted some
buildings half a mile that way.
KYLE points but gets no response. He shrugs, sets off with
Star in that direction. Kyle calls over his shoulder:
KYLE (cont'd)
You can come if you want.
STAR
(hissing at him)
Why? We don't need him.
KYLE
(a shrug, sotto)
I like him. He's funny.
MARCUS looks around at the desolate world-- and the two teens
receding ahead of him. After a beat, he follows.
CUT TO:
HIGHWAY - DAWN
A FALLEN SIGN - "GAS FOOD LODGING."
KYLE, STAR and MARCUS move along the roadside, heading toward
dark BUILDINGS a few hundred yards off near an overpass.
MARCUS
What year is it?
STAR
Seventeen.
KYLE
Nope.
Eighteen.
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
STAR
Are you sure?
KYLE
Yup.
Two thousand eighteen.
MARCUS
Fifteen years... I've lost 15 years.
So who did it to us? Terrorists?
The Russians, the Chinese--?
STAR
Huh?
MARCUS
The nukes. There was a war, right?
Who started it?
KYLE cocks his head at him.
KYLE
Something fall on your head? The
machines did it, the computers--
they got smart.
STAR
Judgment Day... I was just a baby.
KYLE
What's the last thing you remember?
MARCUS
(a beat)
Dying.
REST STOP - DAY
A MEXICAN FAST FOOD JOINT, windows broken, sign collapsed,
near a two-story MOTEL with a COVERED CARPORT. The pavement
is CRACKED, the structures WEATHERED, abandoned for a decade.
MARCUS, KYLE and STAR suddenly rise from a hiding spot by a
DUMPSTER in a parking area. KYLE scans the FAST-FOOD PLACE
with the binoculars, while STAR studies a WATCH she carries.
KYLE
Eyeball.
Only one.
(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:
They drop down again.
ONE AEROSTAT patrols the area. It's a surveillance drone the
size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a
RED GLOW. It flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every
few seconds before continuing on. It vanishes around the
corner of the fast-food joint, moving in the direction of the
motel. STAR has been timing its moves.
STAR
Now!
KYLE and STAR dash for the fast-food entrance, MARCUS just
behind. They round the doorway and--
MOTEL - DAY
AEROSTAT POV - a PIXELLATED ELECTRONIC IMAGE as it patrols
the MOTEL AREA in its geometric pattern. It ZOOMS into the
CARPORT, quickly scanning the abandoned VEHICLES, among which
is an aged, open JEEP WRANGLER, its HOOD UP, parked beside a
customized VAN. The cars are covered in DUST, the TIRES
FLAT, they've been sitting here for a decade.
OBJECTIVE ANGLE - the AEROSTAT zips off on its rounds. After
a moment, the VAN DOOR slides open. MARCUS moves quickly
back to the JEEP, KYLE and STAR behind him.
STAR checks her WATCH while MARCUS goes back to work on the
JEEP'S ENGINE. He's found some tools, already has removed
and cleaned SPARK PLUGS, dismantled the DISTRIBUTOR. KYLE,
meanwhile, returns to INFLATING one of the tires with a
BICYCLE PUMP.
KYLE
If we get it to move, will you
teach me to make it go?
MARCUS
It's called driving.
Sure.
STAR wipes DIRT off the side of the VAN, revealing air-
brushed ARTWORK beneath...
STAR
Wow.
What were these like?
MARCUS looks up from his work to see--
A WHITE UNICORN in a FIELD OF FLOWERS.
MARCUS
(SMILING)
Not too many around in my time.
DISSOLVE TO:
25.
MOTEL - NIGHT
THE AEROSTAT zips past the CARPORT.
As soon as its gone--
STAR
Now!
THE JEEP is suddenly PUSHED from the carport, tires somewhat
inflated. MARCUS is on one side of the rear, KYLE on the
other, STAR behind the wheel, the seat moved all the way up.
They get the vehicle to a slight SLOPE, it begins to roll on
its own.
MARCUS
Pop the clutch! Let your foot up!
ANGLE IN JEEP
We see it's been hot-wired. STAR has her foot all the way
down on the clutch, now lets up--
THE JEEP BUCKS and SPUTTERS... but CATCHES. As soon as it
does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL,
the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS. MARCUS runs for the
driver's side, but the JEEP is pulling ahead fast.
ANGLE IN JEEP
STAR is staring at the speaker, mesmerized at the sound of
the MUSIC. When she looks out the windshield--
--she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror--
--MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the
wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral.
KYLE
Aerostat's coming!
KYLE hops in back as MARCUS adjusts the seat and FLOORS IT.
THE KIDS are exhilarated as MARCUS zooms out of there,
heading off-road across the plains, LIGHTS OFF, MUSIC LOUD.
STAR
Music...
MARCUS
Sort of.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS turns the MUSIC DOWN.
He looks up to see--
--THE AEROSTAT, right over their heads, keeping pace with the
vehicle, RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
KYLE rises in back, SWINGS at it with the SHOTGUN BUTT--
THE AEROSTAT deftly dodges the blows.
STAR
Oh no! It's gonna call a
Harvester, we're dead--
MARCUS SLAMS on the brakes-- the AEROSTAT stops a few feet
ahead of them, hovering in the air.
MARCUS picks up an X-shaped LUG WRENCH from behind his seat,
rises, taking aim--
--and HURLS THE WRENCH with amazing speed and power--
--it flies like a throwing star and SMASHES the AEROSTAT to
BITS in a shower of SPARKS and METAL.
The three of them stare breathlessly for a moment.
KYLE
Wow.
You're good.
MARCUS flexes his hand, startled at his own strength.
DISSOLVE TO:
TEXAS PLAINS - NIGHT
The JEEP moves off-road, HEADLIGHTS OFF, traveling by
MOONLIGHT. It SWERVES and BUCKS from time to time. MUSIC
PLAYS from the TAPE DECK, something more melodic.
ANGLE IN JEEP - KYLE behind the wheel, having the time of his
life, MARCUS supervising, STAR enjoying the breeze and the
unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle.
STAR
Faster!
MARCUS
No!
You're doing fine.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE. MARCUS ejects
the tape, pulls it out-- it's unspooled, tangled in the
stereo's guts. THE KIDS groan disappointedly. STATIC from
the radio now... but a FAINT VOICE audible beneath it.
MARCUS (cont'd)
Ssh.
MARCUS FIDDLES with the dial. He can't get the SOUND clear,
rolls through the dial. Varying levels of STATIC, then a
relatively CLEAR VOICE:
RADIO VOICE
--proper ratio of ammonium nitrate
to diesel fuel. A bomb of this
type can be contained in an
ordinary plastic garbage bag, and
will detonate on impact...
KYLE
(EXCITED)
That's him!
RADIO VOICE
This recording has described booby-
traps and explosive devices. It
will repeat every two hours on
different frequencies to avoid
Skynet jamming...
STAR points toward the horizon.
Marcus looks up.
MARCUS
Stop the car.
KYLE ACCELERATES.
MARCUS (cont'd)
Other pedal, other pedal!
They SCREECH to a halt.
IN THE DISTANCE - a RED GLOW of FLAMES far away. SILHOUETTED
against this, strange FLYING VEHICLES and spindly, spider-
like MACHINES are just visible.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED: (2)
RADIO VOICE
Do not give in to despair. As
bleak as things seem, I assure you,
humanity will triumph.
HIGH ANGLE - THE JEEP turns away from the conflagration,
moves off in a new direction and vanishes into the darkness.
RADIO VOICE (cont'd)
The machines only win when we give
up hope... this is John Connor.
DISSOLVE TO:
SERVICE STATION - DAWN
HIGH ANGLE - a crumbling SERVICE STATION with a RUSTING
TANKER on flat tires, the cab long gone.
MOVE TO FIND the
JEEP approaching off-road.
THE JEEP pulls to a stop, MARCUS gets out from behind the
wheel and moves to the TANKER. STAR and KYLE, with his
binocs, scan the area for signs of Skynet surveillance.
KYLE
We oughta find a place to hole up
for the day...
MARCUS pounds on the TANKER-- a deep echo.
MARCUS
Damn it.
Empty.
KYLE sniffs the air.
KYLE
You smell that?
STAR sniffs the air herself, eyes going wide.
STAR
Food!
They both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE,
each carrying their unloaded GUNS.
HIGH ANGLE - from BEHIND THE RUSTING SIGN, an AEROSTAT
appears, aimed at the kids, LIGHTS BLINKING.
29.
SERVICE STATION - DAY
A HARVESTER-- a GIANT INSECT-LIKE TERMINATOR-- is outside the
station. Many times the size of a human being, MULTIPLE ARMS
and LEGS sprout from its thorax, it has multiple CAMERA EYES
on long, swiveling stalks-- it carries KYLE and STAR, the
kids struggle frantically, caught in the harvester's jointed
steel appendages.
One unblinking EYE SCANS KYLE, another STAR; the harvester
produces a NEEDLE from one of its arms, INJECTS the boy-- who
instantly goes limp, unconscious. It does the same to STAR.
As COW emerges--
--THE HARVESTER SPRINGS on her, with startling speed. She
SCREAMS as the enormous terminator hoists her into the air
with the others, INJECTS her and begins moving toward--
--A TRANSPORT. This consists of CONTAINER resembling a semi-
trailer or wheeled dumpster, attached within a FRAMEWORK that
features movable ENGINE PODS and a mysterious ARMATURE at the
front. A STEEL LID in the top of the container OPENS
hydraulically, the Harvester DEPOSITS the HUMAN CAPTIVES
inside, and the LID SLAMS SHUT.
MARCUS has emerged from the garage, still carrying the AXE.
He stays low, hidden behind the tanker, watching as--
--PIG and BULL flee through a back entrance to the garage,
immediately attracting the attention of--
--the Harvester, which sets off in pursuit.
Marcus comes to a decision.
He SPRINTS into the open, toward
the TRANSPORT, and--
--CLAMBERS up the side, hitting the thing at full speed,
using an engine pod to boost himself higher. He's still
short but swings the AXE and--
--hooks the AXE HEAD over the top of the container, like a
grappling hook. He pulls himself up and--
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
--crawls across the roof, to the LID. There's a barred,
reinforced MESH PANEL here, through which he can see--
ANGLE IN TRANSPORT
--about TWENTY HUMAN PRISONERS, unconscious on the steel
floor. Among them are KYLE and STAR. Star MOANS, opens her
eyes briefly and sees--
--MARCUS' SILHOUETTE above her.
Her eyes flutter shut again.
MARCUS struggles to raise the sealed lid, but there's no
purchase available, just a smooth seam. Suddenly--
--the TRANSPORT JERKS. MARCUS nearly loses his footing as
the TRANSPORT STARTS ROLLING forward. He drops to his belly,
seeing that the transport is approaching--
--the HARVESTER, which now carries PIG and BULL, both
unconscious. THE LID OPENS and the Harvester DROPS the two
men INSIDE-- but its camera eyes fail to register Marcus, who
crouches behind the open lid. As the lid BEGINS TO CLOSE,
the Harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the
transport, making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine.
MARCUS THRUSTS THE HEAD OF THE AXE under the closing LID in
order to prevent it from sealing. THE LID grinds against it,
but remains ajar. A moment later--
--THE ENGINE PODS ROTATE DOWNWARD, FIRE and--
--THE TRANSPORT LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Within moments, the
airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air.
AERIAL - DAY
MARCUS moves to the edge, looks down in astonishment at the
fallow plains far below. Looking to the side, he sees--
--A PAIR OF HUNTER KILLERS, swooping in quickly to provide an
escort for the slower moving transport.
WIND buffets Marcus, he hangs on for dear life. Clinging to
the top of the transport, he slowly makes his way back toward
the LID. As the transport BANKS, he almost loses his grasp,
dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself.
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his
might. This thing is really heavy, plus he's fighting the
WIND BLAST. MARCUS hears something behind him--
THE HARVESTER has spotted him and is now prying itself loose
from the armature. Also buffeted by the wind, it starts to
move gingerly down the length of the transport toward Marcus.
MARCUS must let the LID CLOSE. He snatches up the AXE, takes
a couple of WHACKS at the thing, DENTING the metal, but doing
no serious damage. The Harvester KNOCKS the weapon out of
his hand, Marcus has no choice but to keep backing away.
MARCUS is driven to the back of the transport. Struggling
for handholds, he lowers himself out of sight, down the
framework along the side, getting out of the wind. Suddenly--
--STEEL CLAWS WRAP around him FROM BELOW, YANK him downward.
THE HARVESTER has crawled around the SIDE of the TRANSPORT,
and under the BOTTOM, in order to GRAB HIM. The hideous
machine now holds him in its clutches, hundreds of feet in
the air, its CAMERA EYES fixed on him.
THE HARVESTER produces its needle, it's coming at his face--
but MARCUS frees one hand, grabs the syringe, managing to
hold it back, inches from his skin. His strength is
weakening, but as the Harvester makes its final thrust--
--he JERKS the NEEDLE to one side and it BENDS against one of
the Harvester's own steel limbs.
Undaunted, the creature crawls up the side of the transport,
Marcus still in its clutches. It moves to the lid, which
OPENS. It lets go of Marcus to drop him inside when--
--MARCUS seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the
harvester's back, where he--
--GRABS a couple of EYE STALKS, trying to RIP them from the
harvester's thorax, LOOSE WIRES SPARK. The Harvester twists
and thrashes, it's like he's a rodeo rider. A LIMB wraps
around him, starting to CRUSH him in a vise-like grip, when
SUDDENLY--
--CANNON FIRE RIPS through the towering HARVESTER, blowing
its thorax to PIECES, barely MISSING MARCUS.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED: (2)
A PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack
aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either
side of the transport.
THE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport,
still clutching MARCUS and--
--CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both
suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE
BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the
engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it
now, to keep from falling.
The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance
planes.
A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily
armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS.
CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE
PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank.
An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the
ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying
erratically, heading downward and--
--CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL.
AERIAL & RIVER - DAY
The planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES. On
the far banks, even from above, we see ominous MILITARY
FORTIFICATIONS-- CONCRETE BUNKERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, etc.
MARCUS meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead Harvester,
avoid the ENGINE BLAST and find a handhold on the transport.
THE A-10 that shot down the H-K comes around for another pass
at the transport, but--
--ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS at the far side of the river let out a
VOLLEY of BLUE PLASMA-FIRE. The BURSTS arc toward the A-10,
which swerves and climbs, but--
--PLASMA FIRE destroys a wing, the A-10 SPINS out of control.
THE OTHER A-10 breaks off its dogfight with its H-K and
speeds away from the river.
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the
transport, he reaches out and--
--THE FRIED HARVESTER suddenly dislodges from the ENGINE POD,
taking Marcus with it, into FREEFALL.
WITH MARCUS, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet
below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing
the river.
MARCUS' POV - the ground and treetops getting closer. At the
last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him OVER
THE RIVER and--
MARCUS and the DEAD HARVESTER HIT THE WATER, hard, vanishing
below the surface with enormous SPLASHES.
The surviving H-K and the TRANSPORT continue across the river
into Skynet territory, vanishing in the distance.
CAMERA MOVES to FIND a PARACHUTE, drifting earthward on the
unfortified side of the river.
RIVERBANK - DUSK
HOLD ON LAPPING WATER for a beat.
Then--
--MARCUS breaks the surface, staggering toward shore, he
drops to his knees in the shallows.
WAKES APPEAR behind him. Hearing the water stir, Marcus
turns to see numerous DARK SHAPES moving rapidly in on him,
from different directions, FLASHES OF METAL visible beneath
the surface. These are HYDROBOTS-- AQUATIC TERMINATORS-- but
we don't get a good look at them (yet) and Marcus isn't
sticking around. He scrambles for the riverbank and makes
his way into the leafless trees.
TREES - EVENING
MARCUS moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks
over the water in the direction the transport took.
BLAIR (O.S.)
Yo!
Up here!
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
BLAIR WILLIAMS, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from
the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees
about fifteen feet in the air above Marcus.
MARCUS moves closer.
Blair struggles to saw through her
lines with a KNIFE.
BLAIR (cont'd)
Who are you--
The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.
Marcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an
instant and CATCHES HER. He holds her in his arms:
MARCUS
Name's Marcus.
BLAIR
You can put me down now, Marcus.
He does so. Blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short.
She's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no-nonsense,
battle-hardened member of the Resistance. She pulls a
COMPASS from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she
orients herself.
BLAIR (cont'd)
I've got an ELT, but I can't call
for a rescue here. There's an
outpost a few miles upriver-- not
my favorite people in the world,
but it's safe. Let's move.
Blair is already moving, Marcus hesitates, then points across
the water.
MARCUS
I'm heading that way.
BLAIR
(a short laugh)
The hot zone? No you're not.
MARCUS
I've got to get to my friends--
BLAIR
What friends?
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED: (2)
MARCUS
Couple of kids. They were in that
flying dumpster--
BLAIR
The Skynet transport? It was
carrying people?
(off his nod)
Christ, we almost shot it down.
There've been rumors about a
concentration camp, but...
She shakes her head, gestures toward the river.
BLAIR (cont'd)
You can't get across-- river's
fulla hydrobots--
MARCUS
Hydrobots?
BLAIR
They can't see, but they have killer
sonar. They'll attack anything that
moves or makes a sound. Even if you
get past them, you'd be dead before
you covered a hundred yards. If the
terminators don't get you, the fallout
will-- heavy rads all the way to the
Gulf coast, nothing can live there.
Marcus absorbs this, starts walking with her.
MARCUS
You're with the Resistance.
BLAIR
Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what
used to be the Air National Guard.
She puts a hand out, listening.
She signals for him to lay
low, behind a fallen tree.
NEARBY-- a pair of T-1s on patrol rumble into view. They
pause, scanning the area, chain-guns at the ready. They
start to move toward BLAIR and MARCUS' hiding place.
BLAIR quickly grabs a STONE and, staying down, hurls it as
far away as she can--
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED: (3)
THE STONE strikes a few BRANCHES--
THE T-1s suddenly turn in that direction, GUNS BLAZING--
THE WOODS in the immediate vicinity are torn to pieces by the
GUNFIRE, small FIRES erupt from the incendiary bullets-- it's
definitely overkill.
THE T-1s roll over to inspect the damage, out of view.
BLAIR whispers:
BLAIR (cont'd)
Stupid bastards. Come on.
She and Marcus move away quickly, away from the trees.
When
they're a safe distance from the robots--
MARCUS
I don't know... this has gotta be
some kind of, like, dream or
hallucination. Like what happens
to people right before they die...
Blair SLUGS him hard, in the arm.
He doesn't flinch, but he
looks surprised.
BLAIR
That snap you out of it?
MARCUS shakes his head.
They keep walking.
BLAIR (cont'd)
Well hell, maybe you are dreaming. Do
us all a favor and wake up already.
CUT TO:
MUTANT FOREST - NIGHT
THE MOON over a scrubby forest, trees just a few feet high.
BLAIR and MARCUS seem like giants as they move among them.
They've been talking a while, Blair's absorbing something.
BLAIR
So let me get this straight, Marcus.
There you are on death row, they stick
a needle in your arm...
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
BLAIR (cont'd)
and the next thing you know, you're
here.
(off his nod)
Since this ain't the resurrection,
there's only one possibility.
MARCUS
Let's hear it.
BLAIR
Whatever they pumped into your veins just
knocked you out. This Angel Project you
signed up for-- there was a lotta
cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs
fell, they musta froze your ass.
MARCUS
What the hell for?
BLAIR
Drug tests, medical experiments, organ
harvesting, who knows? You said you
had no family, no friends-- why let a
body like yours go to waste?
She's looking him over as she says this, it almost sounds
flirtatious. Marcus changes the subject.
MARCUS
I've never seen trees like these.
BLAIR
We're in a mutation zone. I saw a
two-headed squirrel here once--
MARCUS
Freaky.
BLAIR
(SHRUGS)
Tasted like chicken.
BLAIR pauses, checking a small GEIGER COUNTER she carries--
it CLICKS a bit.
BLAIR (cont'd)
Levels are tolerable now, but just.
We can't spend the night here.
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED: (2)
They start moving again.
Marcus pauses, listens:
MARCUS
What was that?
BLAIR
I didn't hear anything--
Now they both hear an eerie HOWL, changing in pitch-- like a
coyote on crack. More than one picks up the CHORUS.
BLAIR (cont'd)
Skindogs.
She pulls a SIDEARM, holds it at the ready as she starts
running, away from the direction of the noise. Marcus keeps
up at her side, looking behind them.
WITH THE DOGS
We don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large
BEASTS moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the
fleeing humans.
BLAIR sees they won't outrun them. She spins, FIRES in the
direction of the approaching PACK. Suddenly it's quiet-- the
animals fan out, forming a circle around Blair and Marcus.
MARCUS
They're surrounding us.
QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED
TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.
BLAIR
They're smart. And they don't
scare easy.
After a few tense beats, from the foliage--
A SKINDOG leaps at BLAIR from behind-- it's hideous, the size
of a Great Dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and
long, catlike CLAWS. Before Blair can react, MARCUS leaps
between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the
throat. It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages
to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward--
TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED: (3)
BLAIR FIRES a few SHOTS at the encroaching pack, we hear a
few YELPS--
MARCUS protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more SKINDOGS
aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches.
The other SKINDOGS turn on dead and injured pack members,
begin TEARING INTO THEM. There's an opening now, the two
humans make a run for it.
BLAIR catches her breath, looking him over, seriously
impressed by his strength and calm.
BLAIR (cont'd)
You saved my ass. Thanks.
MARCUS shrugs, turns back to see the feeding frenzy.
MARCUS
Dog eat dog world.
DISSOLVE TO:
NORMAL FOREST - NIGHT
It's darker now, the moon is down. MARCUS and BLAIR move
gingerly-- she TRIPS, he catches her before she falls.
BLAIR
Thanks.
BLAIR sighs, yawns, sits against a tree.
BLAIR (cont'd)
It's not far, but we'll never get
across the mine field at night.
Might as well STAF till morning.
MARCUS nods, sits a few feet away from her.
BLAIR (cont'd)
C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite.
MARCUS slides toward her, she nestles against him.
MARCUS
Staf?
What's that mean?
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
BLAIR
It's a resistance term.
Sit tight
and fuck.
Soon they're kissing passionately.
But MARCUS pulls away,
rolls onto his back.
BLAIR (cont'd)
You holding out for lipstick?
Lingerie? Or am I not your... type?
MARCUS
I'm not gay. In prison, I thought
about puss-- women all the time. But
now... it's not working. Who knows,
all those years on ice...
BLAIR
Maybe it's just gonna take some time.
Before you're completely thawed out.
She's slipped a hand inside his pocket for warmth... now she
pulls out the SCRAPS of paper, with women's faces. She
squints at these in the dark.
BLAIR (cont'd)
What are these?
MARCUS
I dunno. They just... sorta
reminded me of her.
BLAIR
Who?
MARCUS speaks carefully, unsure how to articulate this.
MARCUS
There's a woman, the last woman I
saw before... when I was under, the
dead time-- she kept coming to me.
I think she must've saved me.
BLAIR
I can't compete with that.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED: (2)
She closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against
his chest. Marcus stares up into the darkness.
CUT TO:
LOADING ZONE - NIGHT
The TRANSPORT has landed amongst numerous CONTAINERS, CRANES
and VEHICLES-- all is dimly lit, enveloped in a vague reddish
HAZE. THE FLYING FRAMEWORK and ARMATURE detach from the
TRANSPORT, and TAKE OFF into the air again-- leaving the
trailer-like wheeled CONTAINER. Something resembling the CAB
of a semi-truck backs into position, latching onto attachment
points on the container.
LOADING ZONE/HIGHWAY - NIGHT
THE CAB and CONTAINER, now resembling a semi, pulls out of
the loading area. Digitally controlled, it needs no
headlights as it rolls in the near-darkness.
OVERHEAD ANGLE as the vehicle moves onto a cloverleaf access
ramp leading to a HIGH SPEED SUNKEN HIGHWAY, a river of fast-
moving TRAFFIC heading in both directions-- unlit vehicles
moving close together at 120 mph through the reddish gloom.
CUT TO:
FOREST CLEARING - DAWN
CLOSE - BLAIR and MARCUS's feet trudge through low brush,
step over undergrowth. CAMERA MOVES to find a STRAND OF
BARBED WIRE, emerging from the dirt a few feet away.
MARCUS pauses, almost having stepped on a WATERMELON.
MARCUS
We're in somebody's garden.
BLAIR stops walking, alarmed, a few feet away from him.
BLAIR
Christ... there's supposed to be
barbed wire along the edge.
MARCUS looks around them, points.
MARCUS
Over there.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
A few yards away, STRINGS OF BARBED WIRE... CAMERA MOVES to
reveal it's behind as well as ahead of them. They've come
through a gap where the wire had fallen.
BLAIR
Whatever you do, don't move.
(SHOUTS)
Yo! Morrison, Barnes! Can anybody
hear me?!
(to Marcus)
We're in the middle of the mine field.
CUT TO:
FOREST CLEARING - DAY
BARNES pokes his head up from a concealed TRAPDOOR thirty
yards from BLAIR and MARCUS, who are hoarse from shouting.
BARNES
Blair? Good to see you.
(off her glare)
What's the password?
BLAIR
Eat shit and die, Barnes!
BARNES
Close enough. Who's your friend?
BLAIR
Could you get us outta here please?
BARNES
Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in
a mine field.
BLAIR
You didn't maintain the perimeter!
Where are your sentries?
BARNES
It's too early for that military crap.
BARNES consults a MAP, turning it to orient himself.
BARNES (cont'd)
OK, if you keep walking straight
you're gonna get blown all to
hell... turn to your left and take,
oh... five steps.
BLAIR and MARCUS obey, moving cautiously.
BARNES (cont'd)
OK, face me now. Three steps.
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
They do as told.
BARNES (cont'd)
Almost home. Turn to your right
and take another five steps...
They slowly pace five steps.
On the fifth one, there's a
CLICK beneath Marcus' foot--
A horrified moment of eye contact between him and Blair-- she
DIVES TO THE GROUND, away from him as--
BOOM!
MARCUS is thrown through the air by the EXPLOSION--
MARCUS' BODY lands a few feet from the trap door.
FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
THE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low
growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles,
coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged
beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED
CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS.
THE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the
LAUNCH TUBE.
FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
Near the edge of the clearing, a low STEEL VENT with a peaked
CAP. DENTS appear in it from within--
MARCUS finally PUNCHES his way out, pulls himself up and
rolls onto the dirt-- for a moment he seems safe, laying low
in the grass. Then--
--he registers the REBAR in his shoulder. It goes right
through him, emerging from his chest. Marcus is stunned.
With some effort, he YANKS OUT the REBAR and tosses it aside.
TORN METAL of his steel endoskeleton is now exposed, along
with a glimpse of circuitry. Marcus reels, puts a hand over
the hole in his chest where a heart should be; he really
isn't human. He doesn't have much time to deal with this as--
--THE CHOPPER emerges from behind the treeline, the SPOTLIGHT
picks him out and AUTOMATIC FIRE erupts--
MARCUS runs a few yards and throws himself to the ground as--
GUNFIRE STRAFES around and ahead of him-- setting off several
MINES which send up clouds of dirt.
MARCUS picks himself up and runs for the trees, leaping over
the barbed wire.
FOREST - NIGHT
MORE GUNFIRE rips apart the trees around Marcus as he sprints
and weaves, making his way toward the river. The SPOTLIGHT
picks him up and loses him again-- it's tough for the chopper
to get a clear shot at him here.
RIVERBANK - NIGHT
MARCUS has reached the edge of the trees, he can see the
river just beyond. He starts to move for it, when--
--FWOOM! The forest around him ERUPTS INTO FLAME, the
chopper has laid NAPALM along the river's edge.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS reels from the intense heat, bats out FLAMES on his
clothes, but his skin remains undamaged. Realizing he can
keep on moving--
--MARCUS DASHES through the dense FIRE to--
RIVER - DAWN
--the RIVER, where the sky is just starting to LIGHTEN.
MARCUS SPLASHES into the shallows, extinguishing the FLAMES.
He fills his hands with water and sucks it down gratefully.
ANGLE ON THE WATER - A GLIMMER of METAL below the surface,
heading for the source of the splashing. Suddenly--
--the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of
Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER
pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two
soldiers we saw before). The BLADE WASH swirls the water in
a whirlpool and beats back the FIRE behind Marcus. As the
GUNNER OPENS FIRE--
--MARCUS DIVES below the surface, BULLETS ZINGING through the
murky water.
UNDERWATER - MARCUS is winged by a couple of shots, his
thermoplastic flesh getting torn apart--
WITH THE GUNNER - He pauses a moment, squinting into the
WATER for a glimpse of Marcus, but failing to register that--
--BELOW THE CHOPPER, right beneath him, the WATER ROILS as if
teeming with piranha. Suddenly--
--HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING
SOUND. Hydrobots resemble segmented serpents, eyeless, but
with razor-sharp heads that DRILL into their victims-- they
respond to sound and vibrations. About a dozen of these four-
foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to
attack the chopper.
INSIDE THE CHOPPER - HYDROBOTS PIERCE the aluminum FLOOR, and
shoot into the cabin, the PILOT and the two SOLDIERS CRY OUT.
The GUNNER tumbles out of the chopper and FALLS in the water.
THE PILOT attempts to maintain control, but the hydraulics
are damaged and the steel serpents thrash about in the cabin.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
THE GUNNER surfaces, trying frantically to swim to shore.
But the hydrobots are upon him, he SHRIEKS and disappears
beneath the bubbling surface, which now boils with BLOOD.
IN THE CHOPPER - A WHIRRING HYDROBOT penetrates the other
soldier's leg. He SCREAMS and wrenches the thing back out,
tossing it from the chopper just before--
--THE CHOPPER CRASHES INTO THE SHALLOWS.
THE PILOT leaps from the cabin and makes it to shore, where
he collapses. But the remaining, wounded SOLDIER can't get
out of the hip-deep water before the HYDROBOTS are upon him.
Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.
A second later, MARCUS SURFACES, slinging the man over his
shoulder. He strides to shore, as if rescuing the man from
enemy fire, hydrobots thrashing and bubbling at his waist.
MARCUS reaches the amazed pilot, lays the wounded soldier
down beside him, then tears a whirring, writhing HYDROBOT
from the soldier's belly and WHIPS its head against a ROCK--
it SPARKS, micro-machine parts fly. The pilot and wounded
soldier stare at him, astonished.
MARCUS
Don't mention it.
He tosses the dead robo-snake aside, then turns and moves
back into the water, quickly vanishing below the surface.
UNDERWATER - MARCUS moves steadily across the silty river
bottom. He doesn't need air. HYDROBOTS come at him, he
swats them away as if they were mosquitoes, CRUSHING in his
hand those that linger too long. Those which make contact
with his artificial skin can't get far, turn and swim off.
FAR RIVERBANK - DAY
MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of
the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves
into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded,
everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a
mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred.
He nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which
emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains
its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing...
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
TERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED.
READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS "NON-ORGANIC -
DO NOT TERMINATE."
THE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested,
moving off on its preprogrammed patrol.
MARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT.
At the top
of the rise, he sees, spread out before him--
SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY
--a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING
FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on
patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape.
After a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers
on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment.
SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY
MARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE
LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING
DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like
wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond.
MARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see--
--A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE.
A second later--
ZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a
few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as--
--a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its
plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice.
MARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS
patrolling near the riverside.
DEMOLITION SITE - DAY
MARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with
the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS.
Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as--
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
A WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET
BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine
has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant
TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust.
CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
MARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives
way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human
world in their own image.
CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure,
automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are
oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with
multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of
legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place
by telescoping steel arms.
SKYNET STREET - DAY
MARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's
ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single-
story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive
open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED
GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred
lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of
POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING
POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc.
MARCUS steps inside one of these buildings--
SKYNET STREET - DAY
Rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees
all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES
built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path
for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him
they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS...
A convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified
SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely
high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL
BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of
clearance on either side.
These things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus
to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast
as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly.
MARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the
street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over
him, the wheels missing him by inches.
But he has only a moment's respite. THE NEXT TRUCK has a
lower undercarriage, a steel CROSSMEMBER catches his back--
--and DRAGS MARCUS beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of
flesh.
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
Marcus CRIES OUT, crawls ahead and clings to a forward
portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the
pavement. His LEFT LEG, twisted and damaged, still drags on
the asphalt, throwing up SPARKS.
OVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE TRUCK - CAMERA PULLS BACK straight
above the MOVING VEHICLE, amidst the convoy speeding down
this sunken artery. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING UPWARD to reveal an
AERIAL VIEW of Skynet's city. Seen from above, the
rectilinear STRUCTURES, criss-crossing POWER LINES and
SPEEDING VEHICLES strongly resemble a PULSING CIRCUIT BOARD.
CUT TO:
SKYNET HIGHWAY - DAY
WITH MARCUS beneath the truck. He's moved to the edge of the
chassis, near a WHEEL, moving slowly, carefully. There's a
bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now,
but they're still moving awfully fast.
THE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a
turn, braking downhill. Marcus seizes this opportunity.
ANOTHER ANGLE as MARCUS LAUNCHES himself from below the
vehicle, rolling into the GAP between the convoy and the
concrete wall. The remaining vehicles RUMBLE PAST, as MARCUS
presses himself against the wall.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
When they're gone, he gets to his feet, limping down the
highway on foot for a short distance, dragging his damaged
leg behind him. He hears ANOTHER CONVOY approaching.
Just in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's
enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the
eight feet of freeway wall.
MARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below.
This is desolate, hilly country.
ANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like
the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished
FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within.
MARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks
for a short distance until--
THE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight.
In
the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the
destination.
Marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading
for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks
down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he
expected to see. CAMERA MOVES to reveal--
COASTAL VALLEY - DAY
--a panoramic view of a GORGEOUS COASTAL COMMUNITY. The
place is lush, green, with well-maintained, lovely HOMES in
the distance, a BLUE SEA beyond. The complex of buildings
stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley.
MARCUS, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this
seeming paradise.
GOLF COURSE - DAY
MARCUS emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself
looking at a groomed FAIRWAY. Marcus hears a NOISE nearby--
--a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.
MARCUS
turns in the direction it came from.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
An electric GOLF CART approaches, driven by a handsome,
middle-aged golfer-- JEREMY-- who wears casual country club
attire, eating from a clear BAG OF TRAIL MIX. Jeremy comes
to a stop beside Marcus.
JEREMY
Are you all right?
Marcus slowly shakes his head, as Jeremy climbs out of the
cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal
at his shoulder and leg.
MARCUS
What the hell is this?
JEREMY
You look like you've been hit by a truck--
MARCUS
Among other things. Look, I'm
trying to find some friends-- a
couple of kids. They were taken
here, I saw some buildings--
JEREMY eyes him, a little surprised at his ignorance.
JEREMY
The facility, sure.
Hop in, I'll
take you there.
Marcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy? But Jeremy
simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger
seat, then gets behind the wheel. With a smile:
JEREMY (cont'd)
This round was gonna blow my
handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy.
He extends a hand.
After a beat, Marcus reaches toward it--
MARCUS
Marcus.
Jeremy clutches Marcus' hand tightly.
Marcus blinks, Jeremy
cocks his head, then lets go.
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED: (2)
JEREMY
I can't connect with you at all...
your interface must've been
damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll
have you as good as new.
With that, he hits the gas.
RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING
JEREMY drives the cart down the road, past well-kept homes
with generous lawns-- it's a beautiful, upscale community at
MAGIC HOUR. BICYCLISTS and FUTURISTIC CARS pass, Jeremy
waves to NEIGHBORS. Marcus takes it all in with disbelief.
MARCUS
I didn't think there was-- anything
like this left... anywhere.
JEREMY
Yes.
We're very lucky.
Want some?
He holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes
a handful of trail mix, pops it in his mouth. After a beat,
he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it.
MARCUS
This isn't food.
JEREMY
Well, of course not. Seems you got
a little memory loss going on.
Marcus stares at him, confused. Jeremy is starting to
realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child.
JEREMY (cont'd)
It's a foam resin. It can taste like
anything you want it to-- but of
course, we don't really need to eat.
(BEAT)
Our brains are powered by fuel cells,
remember?
Marcus just stares, Jeremy gestures at the world around them.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
JEREMY (cont'd)
We're in a transitional phase.
Most of us need the comfort of the
familiar a little while longer--
food, shelter, sex. Until we
forget the old life.
As he speaks, he notices his BAG is nearly empty. He
casually lifts his sport shirt and CLICKS OPEN a PANEL
beneath his rib cage. We glimpse CIRCUITS, FIBER-OPTICS.
JEREMY (cont'd)
Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of
the hardest habits to break... but
before long, none of this will be
necessary. We won't even need these
bodies.
From within he removes an identical BAG FILLED with TRAIL MIX
(the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag.
He clicks the panel shut again, pops a NUT in his mouth.
Marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away.
He reacts to the sound of PIANO MUSIC, a difficult piece
being played expertly-- PASSING a PICTURE WINDOW, he sees a
PIANIST practicing.
In front of this home, a GARDENER and WINDOW WASHER are hard
at work. They're both T-400s, with the eerie mask-like
faces. Marcus reacts.
MARCUS
Terminators!
Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to
regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if
he'd picked up some homeless guy.
JEREMY
We don't call them that here.
Marcus grabs Jeremy, who pulls back a bit, alarmed.
MARCUS
What are you?
JEREMY
A hybrid.
The same as you.
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED: (2)
MARCUS
A hybrid-- human and machine?
JEREMY
Of course. That's what this community
is for-- people like us.
MARCUS
Jesus... why?
JEREMY
You should be grateful to have been
chosen.
MARCUS
What about the ones who weren't?
JEREMY
You mean like Janet and the kids.
For a moment, Jeremy's expression darkens.
Then he shuts his
eyes, and his features relax.
MARCUS
Your family. You lost them?
Jeremy nods and SMILES, looking at him once more.
MARCUS (cont'd)
Why are you smiling?
JEREMY
`Cause I feel good. The interface
recognizes negative emotions-- rage,
grief, despair-- and stimulates
positive endorphins in response. Thank
God, life would be pretty unbearable
otherwise, don't you think?
PARK - DUSK
They've left the main street now, driving down a WOODED PATH
leading to the "facility." There are lawns, fountains, etc.
Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the
throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened.
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS
Tell me everything.
How did you
people get here?
JEREMY
Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA.
I was an engineer on Project Angel--
Marcus drags the man from the cart by his throat, squeezing
harder.
MARCUS
Angel-- what is it?
JEREMY
Advanced Nexus of Genetic and
Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L.
You can stop choking me, it's not
like I need to breathe.
Marcus releases him, but remains in his face.
Jeremy takes a
moment to recover his composure.
JEREMY (cont'd)
We replaced the body's hydrocarbons
with plastinated compounds while
maintaining cellular structure--
analog neural impulses were converted
to wireless digital signals,
controlling the micro-tech chassis--
MARCUS
English!
JEREMY
(sighs, slowly)
The goal was a superior support
system for the human brain-- to go
anywhere, do anything-- explore
deep space, the bottom of the sea.
I specialized in optics.
He taps his own eye with an audible CLICK, not flinching.
Marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands.
Jeremy points to nearby BUILDINGS, a little peevish.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED: (2)
JEREMY (cont'd)
The facility is just ahead. I'll
let them know you're coming.
So saying, he's back in the cart, pulling away in a hurry.
A
moment later, Marcus moves off amongst the trees.
Nearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above.
He
looks up, stops as he sees--
--a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES.
MARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels
unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made
of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC.
He crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a
SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's
ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT.
Marcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt--
and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we
see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc.
By now he's rolled back a few square yards, numb with horror.
Marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination,
trying to stay out of sight.
CUT TO:
OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
A series of LOW-RISE BUILDINGS, attractively LIT, surrounded
by lawn, trees and water features. A HUMAN TRANSPORT heads
down a RAMP into a parking structure; a GATE closes.
FIND MARCUS, watching this from behind some plastic foliage.
He sets his jaw, removes something from his pocket, fiddles
with it and places it carefully in the bushes. He moves on.
Nearing an entrance, he hears a familiar voice from nearby.
SERENA
Marcus!
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
A BACKLIT FIGURE approaches-- as her face enters the light,
we see that it's SERENA, looking healthy, beautiful. Marcus
stares at her coldly.
SERENA (cont'd)
Marcus... it is you. You're alive,
you found us. Welcome to paradise.
MARCUS
(DISGUSTED)
It's a graveyard.
SERENA takes in his anger, adopts a regretful tone.
SERENA
There was no choice-- the old
civilization had to be eliminated.
To make way for a new world... a
world without death or suffering.
SERENA puts her arms around him. He doesn't return the
embrace, but he doesn't resist her.
SERENA (cont'd)
You were the first... I'm sorry.
So saying, she presses a small, taser-like device at the base
of his skull-- ZAP! MARCUS SPASMS and goes limp in her arms.
SERENA lets him down gently on the ground.
SERENA (cont'd)
We should never have left you behind.
A pair of T-400s now approach from the shadows. They pick up
Marcus and carry him toward the building. CAMERA MOVES to
find, hidden in the bushes where Marcus placed it--
--the ELT, the EMERGENCY BEACON Blaire gave him... activated
now, a single GREEN LIGHT PULSES.
CUT TO:
UNDERWATER - NIGHT
We see now that Connor's on board a NUCLEAR ATTACK SUB, with
TWO MORE SUBS moving in tandem behind it.
HOLD ON the LEAD SUB and MOVE IN ON the STENCILLED NAME as it
PASSES CAMERA: "LOS ANGELES SSN-688."
DISSOLVE TO:
OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
MARCUS is dressed in fresh clothes, his damage repaired-- and
he seems more at ease than we've yet seen him. He walks
beside SERENA, who wears a small EARPIECE, a high-tech
cellphone device. They smile as they pass other HYBRIDS on
the late shift.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:
SERENA
How are you feeling, Marcus?
MARCUS
I'm not sure I know how to describe it.
SERENA
It's called happiness. You've been
angry all your life. You don't
know what it's like to feel... a
part of something.
She clasps his hand in both of hers. MARCUS closes his eyes,
a jolt of pleasure shooting through him.
SPFX MONTAGE
FLYING POV, THROUGH BANKS OF CLOUDS, RICH COLORS in the sky,
glinting GOLDEN LIGHT--
ROCKET DOWNWARD to a PRISTINE COASTLINE, some place like
Hawaii-- PLUNGE INTO THE WATER--
RISE and come face to face with SERENA, SMILING... moving in
for a kiss... CAMERA IRISES OPEN TO WHITE...
OFFICE PARK - NIGHT
SERENA releases Marcus' hands. He opens his eyes slowly,
reeling from the intense moment. CAMERA REVEALS a subtle
BULGE at the base of his skull, the implanted interface.
SERENA
Pure ecstasy... we can share in it
together.
MARCUS
When I was a kid my grandmother
would go on about heaven... it
always sounded so boring.
SERENA
Were you bored just now?
Marcus shakes his head-- far from it.
Serena laughs.
(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED:
SERENA (cont'd)
That sensation is always there for
you, whenever you desire. But most of
us here are scientists... our greatest
joy is using our minds to explore, to
discover... I'll show you.
She leads him up steps into one of the buildings.
OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
MARCUS and SERENA cross the attractive campus.
MARCUS
In the world outside-- the
survivors think Skynet is the
enemy, out to destroy them. Why
don't you tell them about all this?
SERENA
Not everyone can become like us,
Marcus. We just don't have the
resources to sustain more than a
few thousand hybrids.
MARCUS
Then why... Some people I knew were
picked up, taken here...
92.
OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
FIRE and SMOKE in the distance, VEHICLES MOVING fast amidst
the destruction. It looks like the place is under attack.
MARCUS moves purposefully across the campus-- suddenly
HEADLIGHTS illuminate him. He dives out of the way as--
A FUTURISTIC ATV roars past at high speed.
It's followed
moments later by a massive SKYNET TANK.
MARCUS scrambles to his feet, continues on his way.
PARK - DUSK
STAY WITH MARCUS-- FOLIAGE APPEARS around the SPHERE. The
BLUE ENERGY fades, leaving him naked, 20 FEET IN THE AIR--
MARCUS PLUNGES to the ground and rolls.
He looks up--
THE PLASTIC TREE has been melted with the heat like a candle,
DRIPPING down around him.
MARCUS tries to get his bearings-- he's in the park area, the
FACILITY not too far off. He moves in that direction.
96.
OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
THE GATE to the garage OPENS, an empty HUMAN TRANSPORT
emerges... FIND MARCUS, concealed, still unclothed. He dives
under the GATE as it rolls shut.
OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT
KYLE has to swerve to avoid the stolen BUS, which is now on
its side, IN FLAMES. It was taken out by--
--an automated SKYNET TANK, one of THREE TANKS here. They're
positioned to take out escaping vehicles. But the ATV is a
small, maneuverable target, swerving and speeding crazily. A
TANK FIRES and MISSES, the BLAST taking out a chunk of wall.
KYLE WHOOPS, heading across the campus--
--ONE TANK pursues, it moves surprisingly fast, capable of
flattening anything in its path. MARCUS FIRES at it, but the
PLASMA RIFLE BLASTS don't have much effect on the ARMOR.
THE TANK FIRES again, but--
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
--KYLE ROARS around a corner, just in time.
However, in so
doing, he nearly runs over--
--MARCUS, from earlier, on his way to the time sphere,
visible in the HEADLIGHTS for only an instant before he LEAPS
OUT OF THE WAY.
KYLE, focused on the pursuing tank, didn't even see this.
But STAR did. She looks wide-eyed at MARCUS beside her.
STAR
That looked like--
MARCUS
I know.
Long story.
PLAY THE CHASE, as the TANK pursues the ATV through the
facility.
KYLE takes his vehicle through a large FOUNTAIN, which the
TANK SMASHES to bits.
KYLE OVERSTEERS, putting them up on two wheels, then
recovers, narrowly avoiding--
--PLASMA BLASTS, which obliterate the FACADE of a building.
SKELETAL TERMINATORS appear in their HEADLIGHTS, weapons
raised.
MARCUS stands and FIRES over KYLE'S HEAD, BLOWING them out of
the way.
NEAR THE PARK, MARCUS points.
MARCUS (cont'd)
Take that path!
PARK/WOODS - NIGHT
THE TANK is gaining on them, KYLE steers around a GAZEBO, the
tank SMASHES right through it, turning it to splinters.
MARCUS
The trees!
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
Kyle steers toward THE WOODS, dodging between the thick
TREES. Too many obstacles for the TANK here, it SCREECHES TO
A HALT and lets off a JET OF FLAME.
THE TREES behind the ATV all IGNITE, turning to acrid pools
of MELTING PLASTIC. KYLE barely stays ahead of the FIRE.
THE TANK backs up and takes a new route, around the woods.
IN THE WOODS, KYLE strikes a GLANCING BLOW against a tree
trunk, and the ATV TOPPLES on its side, spilling its
passengers. After a beat, they rise, shaken.
MARCUS (cont'd)
You two all right?
STAR
(NODDING)
Why don't you drive?
KYLE
Come on I was doing good!
MARCUS rights the vehicle, taking the wheel, the kids climb
in back.
RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
THE ATV comes rocketing down the main street, MARCUS driving
now. Suddenly, directly in front of them--
--THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN
TURRET SWIVELING at them.
AS IT FIRES, MARCUS SWERVES onto a LAWN and--
--CRASHES THROUGH a PICTURE WINDOW.
LUXURY HOME/BACK YARD - NIGHT
THE ATV JUST CLEARS an enormous SWIMMING POOL, landing hard
on the far deck and moving on, fast.
THE TANK SMASHES THROUGH THE BACK WALL and--
--TAKES A NOSEDIVE into the pool, out of commission.
RESIDENTIAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT
A moment's breather. Marcus slows the vehicle, which WOBBLES
and SMOKES from all it's been through. He looks around.
KYLE
Where are we going?
MARCUS
There.
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
He points toward the COAST, we see a MARINA in the distance,
a BOAT moored at a DOCK.
MARCUS steers the ATV down a slope toward the shoreline.
COASTLINE/DOCK - NIGHT/DAWN
MARCUS, KYLE and STAR leap off the ATV and sprint for a
MOTORBOAT. Kyle carries the rifle now.
As they near the boat, MARCUS reacts to the sight of--
--RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK,
the BLUE GLOW of a RIFLE CHARGING.
MARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with
his BODY. The PLASMA BLAST envelops him, MARCUS is blown--
--INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force
of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE
lies a few feet away.
THE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down
the dock, its PLASMA RIFLE trained on the water now. It
moves past Kyle and Star, who remain motionless on the
ground, and goes to the edge of the dock--
--BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS
the thing in the back, knocking it INTO THE WATER, which is
only a few feet deep here. As it rises, SHE FIRES again,
taking the Terminator's head off. It goes under.
THE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later,
MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back
onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment.
Seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage--
there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE
partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but
can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK.
Kyle and Star back away from him.
KYLE
He's not real.
Marcus shakes his head, starts to move toward them.
STAR
raises the rifle, points it at him.
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
STAR
Don't come any closer!
They hear a WHISTLING SOUND from shore, hit the deck as--
--a MISSILE BLAST TAKES OUT THE BOAT and a large chunk of
DOCK.
Laying low, they look up to see--
--a small army of TANKS and TERMINATORS approaching... even a
HUNTER-KILLER moving in from the horizon, swinging its
SPOTLIGHT in all directions. It looks like the last stand.
MARCUS turns back to KYLE and STAR.
His voice is a distorted
WHISPER.
MARCUS
I'm sorry.
Star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression.
She moves to Marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal--
then hugs him tightly.
Kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea.
His expression
changes, becomes almost hopeful as--
--IN THE DISTANCE, a HUGE, BLACK SHAPE rises to the surface
of the water, just visible against the dawn horizon.
FIREWORKS! MISSILES blast the H-K... NAPALM erupts around
the TANKS and TERMINATOR ARMY as--
--A SQUAD OF A-10s SCREAM IN from over the land, FIRING
CANNONS, launching AIR-TO GROUND MISSILES to take out the
TANKS. ONE A-10 flies low overhead and WAGS ITS WINGS.
COASTLINE - DAY
KYLE points to the dark shape on the water-- now visible as a
huge SUBMARINE with the RISING SUN behind it.
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
HIGH ANGLE as ZODIAC BOATS reach land. HAZ-MAT SUITED
SOLDIERS leap out and run to our heroes at what remains of
the dock, others head inland to provide covering FIRE.
MARCUS addresses a TEAM LEADER, who's taken aback at his
frightening appearance and distorted voice:
MARCUS
There are more prisoners, a complex
about a mile in--
As MARCUS gives the man a few more directions--
--ONE HAZ-MAT FIGURE, standing a few feet off, studies Kyle
and approaches.
HAZ-MAT MAN
What's your name, son?
KYLE
Kyle Reese.
The figure pulls off a glove and unzips his mask, extends a
hand. It's JOHN CONNOR.
CONNOR
John Connor. I'm glad you made it.
KYLE is amazed to be meeting the man face-to-face. He shakes
hands, wide-eyed and speechless. It's a strange moment for
Connor, too, for different reasons.
CONNOR turns away from his first meeting with his father to
be, a bit dizzy at the experience. He addresses Marcus.
CONNOR (cont'd)
Seems I owe you an apology.
MARCUS smiles as best he can, given his ruined face.
MARCUS
Yeah, well. Get in line.
WIDER, as CONNOR replaces his mask, moves to direct his
troops. MARCUS, KYLE and STAR stay close together.
DISSOLVE TO:
107.
MOUNTAIN WAR - NIGHT
SLOW-MOTION, MOS - a SNOWY, MOUNTAINOUS ENVIRONMENT...
STEEL TERMINATORS go down in HAILS OF BULLETS.
We hear
Marcus' VO, his voice strong and assured:
MARCUS (V.O.)
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...
AN ARMY of HUMAN RESISTANCE FIGHTERS marches through the
SNOW, GUNS BLAZING.
MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
...I shall fear no evil...
AN H-K goes down IN FLAMES, SMASHES in the MOUNTAINSIDE.
THE GOLDEN EXPLOSION silhouettes a single FIGURE, who stands
on a PROMONTORY, surveying the battle below. AIDES and
SOLDIERS surround him, but he towers over them, giving
orders, in complete control. MOVE IN SLOWLY on him.
MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
I died, and was reborn. I wear
another man's face, lead another
man's life... yet only now do I
have a reason for living. I once
was lost, but now I'm found...
ANOTHER BLAST illuminates his face for an instant-- scarred,
craggy, a blend of Marcus and Connor-- but fierce, determined
and proud. [Perhaps shoot this with both actors.]
MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
...was blind, but now I see.

THE LIGHT FADES, shadowing him in darkness again and we...
