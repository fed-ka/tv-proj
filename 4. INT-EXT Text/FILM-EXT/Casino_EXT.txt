SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man
approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn
on the ignition.
ACE (V.O.)
When you love someone, you've gotta
trust them. There's no other way.
You've got to give them the key to
everything that's yours.
Otherwise,
what's the point? And, for a while...
I believed that's the kind of love I
had.
Suddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise
into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and
their signs.
Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'.
Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body
twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble
into the flames of damnation.
MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE.
Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly
lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert
night.
ACE (V.O.)
At that time, Vegas was a place where
millions of suckers flew in every
year on their own nickel, and left
behind about a billion dollars. But
at night, you couldn't see the desert
that surrounds Las Vegas...
Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising
above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance.
ACE (V.O.)
But it's in the desert where lots of
the town's problems are solved.
NICKY (V.O.)
Got a lot of holes in the desert,
and a lot of problems are buried in
those holes. Except you gotta do it
right. I mean, you gotta have the
hole already dug before you show up
with a package in the trunk.
Otherwise you're talkin' about a
half-hour or forty-five minutes of
diggin'. And who knows who's gonna
be comin' along in that time? Before
you know it, you gotta dig a few
more holes. You could be there all
fuckin' night.
TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER'
ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the
brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino.
ACE (V.O.)
Who could resist? Anywhere else in
the country, I was a bookie, a
gambler, always lookin' over my
shoulder, hassled by cops, day and
night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam
Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate,
but running a casino. And that's
like selling dreams for cash.
NANCE arrives. He is greeted by ARTIE PISCANO, a gray-haired
sixty-year-old underboss.
TITLE IN: 'KANSAS CITY'
NICKY (V.O.)
That suitcase was all the bosses
ever wanted ...and they wanted it
every month.
PISCANO
Hey, John, how are you? How was your
ride?
NANCE, with suitcase, and PISCANO leave the car and enter
the produce market.
NICKY (V.O.)
Now this old Mormon fuck here...
CUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR
We see a MAN and a WOMAN swimming underwater. Camera reveals
that they are in a motel swimming pool with glass portholes.
Expensive cars are parked outside one of the rooms. Hoods
stand around outside the door.
NICKY (V.O.)
And where they got Green from - who
the fuck knows?
All I know is that
Green was an Arizona real estate
hustler, who barely had enough gas
money to come and pick up his own
fuckin' check...
The two GAMBLERS we saw sauntering out of the bookie joint
are racing to the nearest public phones. Another GAMBLER has
already beaten them to it.
NICKY (V.O.)
He'd be workin' on this shit day and
night. There was nothin' about a
game he was gonna bet that he didn't
know.
GAMBLER #1
(Into phone)
Ace got down at six.
GAMBLER #2
(Into phone)
Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six.
The Tangiers jet with the Tangiers logo on its side as
ICHIKAWA shakes ACE's hands before boarding. SHERBERT follows
him and his associates aboard.
ACE (V.O.)
...free private jets, and two million
of our money.
ACE
Nice to see you again.
ACE (V.O.)
But we got him back. I had our pilot
tell him the plane was on the fritz.
DISSOLVE TO:
SHERBERT apologizes to ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they
all get off the jet.
SHERBERT
Ken, I don't know what the hell went
wrong. I'm awfully sorry.
ICHIKAWA
This is a big problem. Big problem.
SHERBERT
I can't understand it. These
mechanical things, you know, they
happen. Hey, be-better here than
(gesturing to the sky)
up there, you know what I mean?
A smiling ACE greets ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they drive
up and get out of Tangiers limos.
ACE (V.O.)
We got him back ...with a whole floor
of rooms for himself.
ACE
I'm sorry you missed the plane.
ICHIKAWA
You want to get my money back, right?
(Chuckles)
ACE
No, no, no. No gambling. No.
GINGER waves goodbye to the DOORMAN and walks towards two
VALET PARKERS who greet her warmly. She gets a bottle of
pills from one of them and slips some cash into his hand in
return.
GINGER
Okay, thank you for asking.
ACE (V.O.)
She was a queen around the casino.
She brought in high rollers and helped
them spread around a lot of money.
GINGER
(To VALET PARKERS)
Hello.
VALET PARKER
Hey, Ginger, how you doin'?
GINGER
Great.
(Handing the VALET
some money.)
And I have something for you. You
got me covered?
The VALET PARKER places a vial of pills in her hand.
VALET PARKER
Yes. Something for you, there.
GINGER
And you do. Thank you very much.
VALET PARKER
Take care of yourself.
GINGER, on her way out of the casino, passes a folded $100
bill to a smiling older SHIFT BOSS.
ACE (V.O.)
...she took care of the valet parkers,
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.
GINGER
Thanks a lot.
SHIFT BOSS
Thank you, Ginger.
GINGER exits and gets into her car, slipping a VALET PARKER
a $100 bill.
ACE (V.O.)
Ginger took care of the parkers
because they took care of the security
guards, who took care of the metro
cops, who let her operate.
VALET PARKER #3
Thank you, Ginger.
GINGER
(Getting into her car)
I need that stuff tonight.
VALET PARKER #3
No problem.
GINGER
You're a doll.
ACE (V.O.)
The valet parking job was such a
money-maker that they had to pay off
the hotel manager just to get the
concession.
NICKY and MARINO pull up in their car and get out.
NICKY (V.O.)
Ace saw Vegas one way.
NICKY
You call this guy and tell him I'm
comin'?
MARINO
Of course.
They walk into the sportsbook, past numerous bar patrons and
gamblers to TONY, the bookie at a betting counter.
NICKY (V.O.)
But I saw it another. I saw it as
untouched. I mean, they had bookies,
pimps and drug dealers I could shake
down. Who the fuck were they gonna
run to?
So, I started getting
everybody in line. Best of all, for
the first time in my life, I figured
out a way not to lose.
ACE (V.O.)
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme,
all right. It wasn't very scientific
but it worked. When he won, he
collected. When he lost, he told the
bookies to go fuck themselves. What
were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?
(Chuckles.)
Nicky was the muscle.
NICKY grabs TONY by the back of his neck.
NICKY
Tony.
TONY
Hey.
NICKY
How you doin'?
TONY
How you doin'?
NICKY
All right, yeah. You got that thing
for me?
TONY
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought
you was layin'.
NICKY
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it.
I was takin' it.
TONY
You sure?
NICKY
I'm positive.
TONY
Well, I'm a little confused here.
NICKY
You're a little confused?
TONY
Yeah.
NICKY
(Pointing to a window,
above a counter with
a tiny opening to
talk through)
Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face
through this window over here like,
you know, you'll - you'll get
unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!
TONY takes some money out of his coat pocket.
TONY
(Groaning)
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean
anything by it.
NICKY
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it
ready. You thought I was fuckin'
layin' it?!
He smacks the bookie on the head with the wad of money.
TONY
(Gasps)
My fuckin' head.
NICKY
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck
around, Tony.
MARINO
(Pointing to TONY)
Smarten up.
NICKY
(Walking out)
You jag-off.
CLASSROOM NUN (O.S.)
(From following scene)
And now...
NICKY and DETECTIVE BOB JOHNSON are coaching their sons.
JOHNSON pats LITTLE NICKY on the back and with encouraging
words sends him running on to the field.
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
(To LITTLE NICKY)
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
NICKY (V.O.)
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved
with Little League, and it was great.
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
Now, I want you to get out there and
get me singles and doubles, okay?
'Cause that's what's gonna win this
game.
NICKY (V.O.)
Turned out to be one of the other
coaches was a fuckin'...
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
Now go out there and show your dad
what you can do.
NICKY (V.O.)
...metro intelligence cop. But it
didn't matter. I mean, it was all
about the kids, you know.
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
You know, he's gotta realize
everything can't be a home run that
he does.
NICKY
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I
keep tellin' him, but that's the
kind of kid he is ever since he's
born.
DETECTIVE JOHNSON
It's instinctive, you know.
NICKY
He tries to do everything...
LITTLE NICKY hits the ball, NICKY and DETECTIVE JOHNSON
applaud.
NICKY
Ohh!
ACE (V.O.)
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his
presence known.
ACE and GINGER drive up to an expensive house which backs on
to a country-club golf course.
TITLE IN: 'LOS ANGELES'
ACE and GINGER get off the Tangiers jet carrying two
suitcases. ACE gives a chauffeur the luggage and follows
GINGER into a brown Rolls Royce.
ACE (V.O.)
With over a million in cash and jewels
tucked in a bank in Vegas only for
Ginger, she was secure and happy.
A tiger leaps towards the camera, which pans over to two
showgirls and then to ACE's hand holding the key to a Rolls
Royce. He gives it to JONATHAN and DAVID as reporters rush
in to photograph the moment.
NICKY (V.O.)
You know, Ace could be a very touchy
guy, especially when he got bigger
and bigger in town. Like when he
hired that Jonathon and David and
their tigers away from the Palace by
buildin' them a new stage and then
givin' them a silver Rolls Royce.
NICKY, with MARINO, punching and kicking a man next to the
open door of his luxury car.
ACE (V.O.)
...my innovations...
The man falls to the ground.
ACE (V.O.)
...and Nicky's dedication to his
job...
NICKY starts kicking him.
ACE (V.O.)
...I soon had the best operation on
the Strip.
NICKY lifts an empty trash can and shatters the car's
windshield.
Wide overhead of roadhouse cafe isolated in the middle of
the desert with a sign out front that reads '60 miles to
Vegas'.
ACE (V.O.)
Well, it wasn't long before what I
was afraid was gonna happen, happened.
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas, and
from then on, I couldn't be seen
talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or
even near it.
NICKY
(From inside the diner)
What the fuck is that supposed to
mean?
WE MOVE PAST THE SKULL OF A STEER MOUNTED ON AN EXTERIOR
WALL AND A WOODEN CIGAR STORE INDIAN STATUE, TO REVEAL
DOMINICK SANTORO (WHO LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE HIS BROTHER NICKY)
AND MARINO WHO ARE WAITING INSIDE THE GOLD RUSH. CAMERA COMES
TO REST ON EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NICKY'S EYES AS HE STANDS ON
THE OUTSIDE PORCH.
NICKY (V.O.)
So, once they pulled that shit, I
started doin' my own things in Vegas
nobody ever thought of doin'. To
keep an eye on things, I brought in
my kid brother Dominick... and some
desperadoes from back home and started
knockin' over high rollers, casino
bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right
here in town. I had a good fuckin'
crew goin' for me, I'll tell you
that.
SAL FUSCO, JACK HARDY and BERNIE BLUE are getting out of a
car and walking into the jewelry store which is designed to
replicate an old-fashioned Western town with peaked roofs,
wooden planked sidewalks and hitching posts. The camera tracks
by each man as they're introduced.
NICKY (V.O.)
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story
guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a
safe company after he did a six-year
bit. And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy could bypass any alarm for
me. And I opened up my own jewelry
store, too: 'The Gold Rush'.
A VALET PARKER standing outside a casino.
ACE (V.O.)
Valet parkers.
VALET PARKER
(Into telephone)
They're just checking in now.
HARDY and a hood are in a van parked in front of a warehouse
next door to a jewelry store.
ACE (V.O.)
...got a piece of the score.
HARDY
(From inside the van,
into a walkie-talkie)
Car's comin'.
We move past the van to a larger truck parked in an alley.
Unseen, the truck has an open side door abutting the jewelry
store's wall. SAL FUSCO and BERNIE BLUE are inside the truck
drilling into the wall using a heavy-duty battery-powered
drill. The drill is muffled with sheets of insulation
material.
ACE (V.O.)
They were always very careful. And
they always bypassed the alarms, or
else... if not, they'd drill enough
holes to knock through the walls
with a sledgehammer...
BLUE widens the hole with a hammer muffled with insulation.
A flashbulb explodes.
Cops and detectives are photographing and inspecting holes
drilled in the wall of the shop, through which the thieves
have come and gone. The camera moves in through the hole.
ACE (V.O.)
Nobody out there was expecting a guy
like him.
Wide shot of gas station. There is snow on the ground. The
cloudy, Midwestern skyline of warehouses and skyscrapers can
be seen behind the gas station sign: 'All-American Gas'.
NICKY (V.O.)
...and I don't know anybody who can
see that far. Their drop was a truck
stop/garage where...
NICKY is on a phone watching GINGER leave the bank.
NICKY
(Into telephone)
Yeah, she's leavin' the bank now.
All right, I'm gonna follow her.
(He hangs up.)
Three HOODS rush LESTER who is running towards his car. GINGER
bursts through the doors, trying to get to LESTER. ACE holds
her back. They struggle. LESTER groans and gasps as the HOODS
start to beat him up.
HOOD #1
You fuckin' shit.
GINGER
No! No! No! Don't!
ACE restrains her.
The HOODS punch LESTER in the face and stomach.
GINGER
Make them stop it!
(Sobbing.)
No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's
my fault!
NICKY watches from a car in a parking lot across the street,
out of GINGER's sight.
ACE forces GINGER into the car as the HOODS finish the
beating.
GINGER
(Sobbing)
No! No!
The HOODS toss LESTER into his car.
LESTER
(Falling into the
front seat on his
back.)
Fuck!
NICKY watches as the HOODS walk away from LESTER's car.
LESTER
Fuck you!
HOOD #2
You piece of shit.
ACE pulls out of the parking lot with a wailing GINGER.
LESTER groans, trying to sit up.
LESTER
(As ACE and GINGER
drive off down the
street)
Couldn't do it yourself, you
chickenshit cocksucker!
NANCE, dumping two large suitcases in the trunk of a car.
NICKY (V.O.)
...suitcases kept comin' and goin'.
And let me tell ya, the fuckin' bottom
line here is... cash.
The trunk lid is shut.
GREEN gets off the Tangiers corporate jet and is assaulted
by questions about the Scott murder. GREEN is stunned.
REPORTER #1
Can you comment on the murder of
Anna Scott?
GREEN
What are you talking about?
REPORTER #1 (O.S.)
She was found last night, shot in
the head.
REPORTER #2 (O.S.)
Was this just a real-estate
partnership?
REPORTER #3 (O.S.)
Her lawyer said you were partners.
GREEN
We were - We were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.
It was never a partnership.
Reporters chase CHASE as he walks down the ramp and across
the tarmac to his white limousine.
REPORTER #1
Police are calling this a mob-style
killing.
REPORTER #2
Did you ever hear of the twenty-two-
caliber killer?
GREEN
I'm a little in shock, quite
frankly...
ACE (V.O.)
Now, instead of the cops only lookin'
at Nicky, they started looking at
Green too. And he was supposed to be
our squeaky...
We see NICKY through the telephone booth glass.
NICKY
(Into telephone)
...I gotta meet Clean Face right
away. What about the Chez Paree?
SUPER SUBTITLE
'I gotta meet Charlie the Banker
right away at your house, okay?'
ACE
(Into telephone)
No, you, you can't. You gotta make a
reservation.
ACE
(Into telephone)
...very difficult to get in.
NICKY
(Into telephone)
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service
entrance. I'll see you at nine.
SUPER SUBTITLE
'I'll come in from the golf course
side. See you at six.'
ACE
(Over telephone)
Uh...
QUICK ZOOM OUT FROM A DEAD BODY WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND IN THE
CHEST. COPS AND PRESS ARE MILLING AROUND.
CAMERA SPIRALS OUT FROM THE BODIES OF A CASINO EXECUTIVE AND
HIS WIFE WHO HAVE BEEN GUNNED DOWN ON THEIR FRONT LAWN.
ACE (V.O.)
A casino boss and his wife were
killed. The bulls questioned Nicky.
Police photographers taking pictures of a dealer, dead behind
the wheel of his car, his eyes and mouth frozen wide open in
a silent scream.
ACE (V.O.)
A dealer from the Sirocco... they
questioned Nicky.
We see a brand-new car explode.
ACE (V.O.)
A lawyer... they questioned Nicky.
A front door where a pile of newspapers have accumulated.
Another newspaper is thrown at the door.
ACE (V.O.)
And when some guys who didn't pay
their Shylocks began disappearing,
Nicky's name was in every one of
those newspapers.
NICKY and OSCAR GOODMAN, his lawyer, leave the court-house,
surrounded by reporters and photographers. They wait at the
curb for the light and NICKY, smiling, politely cautions a
photographer to be careful of the on-coming traffic.
ACE (V.O.)
Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let
him go. There were never any
witnesses.
NICKY (V.O.)
The coppers blamed me for everything
that went wrong out here, and I mean
every little fuckin' thing too.
NICKY
(To photographer)
Watch yourself. You're gonna get
runned over there.
NICKY (V.O.)
If a guy fuckin' tripped over a
fuckin' banana peel, they'd bring me
in for it.
NICKY
(To reporters)
Come on, huh. That's enough now. Be
nice, huh? Be nice.
NICKY is talking quietly to MARINO. They are surrounded by
people waiting for the bus.
NICKY (V.O.)
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin'
their Di Nobilis and they're eatin'
a trippa [Italian-American slang for
'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you
know, fried pigs guts? While, if I
wanna talk private, I gotta go to a
fuckin' bus stop.
NICKY
(To MARINO)
But, hey, what do they care, as long
as I keep sendin' money back.
MARINO
Yeah, but they're complaining.
NICKY
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's
here.
The bus arrives, obscuring our view of them.
NICKY
I do all the work. Somebody don't
like it, fuck him.
MARINO
It's up to you.
NICKY
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
When the bus departs it reveals NICKY and MARINO alone on
the bench, talking.
NICKY
I know one thing. All I gotta do is
take care of four or five of those
fuckin' guys, the rest will fall
right into place. Believe me.
NICKY swings a gold club. MARINO, and two men, are with him.
ACE (V.O.)
...on the line and this guy's out
havin' the time of his life. He has
every cop in the state watchin' him,
and he's out playin' golf.
NICKY
Practice enough this week, you prick?
ACE (V.O.)
And at the...
ACE is with the Control Board investigators AUSTIN and DUPREY.
They are all pouring over legal files and record books out
on a table by the swimming pool.
ACE (V.O.)
...worst possible time for me.
AUSTIN
A record of the arrests...
ACE (V.O.)
I had my license hearing coming up
and I didn't wanna leave anything to
chance.
ACE
That was nineteen years ago, and
they were simple gambling pinches.
ACE (V.O.)
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?
AUSTIN
You've been very open with us. I
mean, uh, your books and papers and...
that - that's gonna mean something
when you go before the Commission.
ACE
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a
fair hearing.
DUPREY
Well, this kind of honesty will
guarantee that fair hearing.
ACE
Good.
AUSTIN
All right, well, we'll move on to -
Suddenly a sputtering airplane flies right over Ace's house.
AUSTIN (O.S.)
(As he looks at the
plane)
I wanted to hear something about...
Kansas City.
NICKY
(Looking at the
airplane)
What the fuck is this? Where's this
fuckin' guy gonna land, on the
fairway?
ACE and the board investigators follow the plane as it lands
on the fairway. ACE has taken off his sunglasses to get a
better look. Two men in suits get out.
NICKY
(To MARINO)
They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.
Look at this.
The AGENTS run across the golf course, past ACE and the
investigators, who look on open-mouthed.
ACE (V.O.)
The Feds were watchin' Nicky play
golf for so long, they ran out of
gas. Just what I needed. Right in
front on the Control Board.
The agents run behind the hedges by ACE's pool. AUSTIN and
DUPREY stare at ACE as if he had something to do with it.
NICKY
A hundred dollars, whoever hits the
plane.
NICKY, MARINO, and the other men swing their clubs.
ACE (V.O.)
(putting his sunglasses
back on)
And, as if things weren't bad
enough...
ACE (V.O.)
...in comes Piscano, the Kansas City
underboss. He ran that little grocery
store in Kansas City where they
brought the suitcases.
GAGGI hands STONE an issue of the Las Vegas Sun showing a
photograph of ACE at the licensing hearing. Headline reads:
'Rothstein out of gaming: Control Board Rules against
Rothstein License Application'.
ACE (V.O.)
(from previous scene
continued)
Fuckin' hypocrites!
STONE stands beside GAGGI's car door. GAGGI is in the back
seat with his window down.
GAGGI
What the hell's he gonna do now?
STONE
I don't know
(Sighs.)
GAGGI
What's he doin'? He knows all those
guys he yelled at are friends of
ours. What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?
STONE
Maybe he could run things with another
job title. Wouldn't be the best,
but, uh, what are we gonna do?
GAGGI
However he runs things, it's gotta
be quiet. Let him hide upstairs in
the office. Say he's the janitor, I
don't give a shit. But, please,
whatever job he takes, make sure
it's something quiet.
STONE walks back to his car. Both cars pull out in opposite
directions.
VEGAS - NIGHT
SHERBERT and ACE pull up beside another parked car. ACE gets
out of his car in a robe and pajamas and gets into STONE's
car.
A solitary ACE waiting in the vast desert, looking around.
ACE looks at a sage brush and sand and a few rocks on the
desert floor. This could be a hole meant for him. He steps
away from it.
ACE (V.O.)
Meeting in the middle of the desert
always made me nervous.
It's a scary place. I knew about the holes in the desert, of
course, and everywhere I looked, there could have been a
hole.
Aerial shot of NICKY driving.
ACE (V.O.)
Normally, my prospects of comin'
back alive from a meeting with Nicky
were ninety-nine out of a hundred.
But this time, when I heard him say,
'A couple a hundred yards down the
road', I gave myself fifty-fifty.
ACE still standing in the desert. NICKY's car suddenly appears
as a reflection in ACE's sunglasses, shaking ACE out of his
desert-induced reverie. NICKY's car pulls up by ACE. He gets
out and storms up to him.
NICKY
Where the fuck you get off talkin'
to people about me behind my back?
Goin' over my head?
ACE
What people?
NICKY
What people! What'd you think, I
wasn't gonna find out?
ACE
I don't even know what you're talkin'
about, Nick.
NICKY
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on
you?! I gotta listen to people because
of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering
me out?! You better get your own
fuckin' army, pal!
ACE
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't
order you or anybody...
I only told
Andy Stone that you had a lot of
heat on you, and that was a problem.
NICKY
You want me to get out of my own
fuckin' town?!
ACE
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit
blow over for a while so I can run
the casino. Anything goes wrong with
the casino, it's my ass. It's not
yours, it's my ass.
NICKY
Oh, I don't know whether you know
this or not, but you only have your
fuckin' casino because I made that
possible!
ACE
I -
NICKY
(Interrupting)
I'm what counts out here! Not your
fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin'
TV shows! And what the fuck are you
doin' on TV anyhow?!
ACE
What are you -
NICKY
(Interrupting)
You know I get calls from back home
every fuckin' day?!
They think you
went batshit!
ACE
I'm only on TV because I gotta be
able to hang around the casino. You
understand that. You know that. Come
on.
NICKY
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had
the food and beverage job without
goin' on television!
You wanted to
go on TV.
ACE
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That
way I have a forum. I can fight back.
I'm known. People see me. They know
they can't fuck around with me like
they could if I was an unknown. That's
right.
NICKY
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle
of yourself.
ACE
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this
situation if it wasn't for you. You
brought down so much fuckin' heat on
me. I mean, every time I meet somebody
here, the big question is do I know
you.
NICKY
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your
fuckin' license on me, is that it?
ACE
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked
me if you could come out here, what
did I tell you? I mean, you asked
me, and I knew you were going to
come out no matter what I said, but
what did I tell you? Do you remember
what I told...
NICKY
(Interrupting)
Back -
ACE
...you? Do you remember what I told
you?
NICKY
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin'
minute here. One minute. I asked
you?! When the fuck did I ever ask
you if I could come out here?! Get
this through your head, you -
ACE
(Interrupting)
You never - ?
NICKY
Get this through your head, you Jew
motherfucker, you. You only exist
out here because of me!
That's the
only reason!
Without me, you,
personally, every fuckin' wiseguy
skell [Skell: the lowest form of
wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll
take a piece of your fuckin' Jew
ass! Then where you gonna go?!
You're
fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over
my fuckin' head again! You
motherfucker, you!
NICKY drives off, leaving an angry and frustrated ACE to
ponder the desert and the holes.
GINGER, sporting a new short hairstyle, and AMY exit and
walk towards camera.
HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.)
Hello, Beverly Hotel.
ACE (O.S.)
Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.
HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.)
I'm sorry.
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein
have checked out already.
TRACK BACK, AS GINGER SMILES, TO REVEAL LESTER DIAMOND.
LESTER
Hey.
GINGER kisses LESTER.
LESTER
(To AMY)
Hey, little Dale Evans.
GINGER laughs
HOTEL OPERATOR (O.S.)
Yes, they both checked out.
NICKY is leaning against a public phone. MARINO watches.
NICKY
(Into telephone)
You just relax. Nobody's killin'
anybody, do you hear?
GINGER
(Over telephone)
No, I really do. I think he's gonna
kill me.
NICKY
(Into telephone)
You just relax, and call me back
here in exactly an hour, on this
phone, and I'll see what I can do.
GINGER
(Over telephone)
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
AMY is swinging her purse at LESTER in the background.
GINGER
(Into telephone)
So, I'm gonna call you back in an
hour... at this number, and you're
gonna be there, right?
NICKY
(Over telephone)
I'll be there.
NICKY
(Into telephone)
And listen, don't do anything else
crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
GINGER
(Into telephone)
Bye.
She hangs up and walks over to LESTER and AMY who are
fighting.
GINGER
Just knock it off! Would you two
knock it off? Get in the car.
LESTER
She started it. She started the whole
thing. I'm just standin' here.
GINGER opens the driver's side door.
LESTER
You're not gonna drive. Don't even
think you're gonna drive.
GINGER
No, I'm gonna drive.
LESTER
(Stopping GINGER)
No, I'm not gonna drive with some
crazy -
GINGER
(Yelling)
You're driving me nuts!
She walks around to the passenger door.
LESTER
Get in the passenger's side! And I'm
sendin' this kid to Bolivia in a
fuckin' box.
Through glass doors we see ACE seated in his living-room.
NICKY slips into frame and taps on the window, gesturing
that he wants to talk. ACE signals for him to go around to
the garage.
GINGER is on the phone. In the background, AMY is acting up
in the back seat of the car and driving LESTER crazy.
ACE
(Over telephone)
Hello.
GINGER
(Sighs, into telephone)
Hi, it's me.
(Chuckling.)
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
ACE
(Over telephone)
Listen...
ACE
(Over telephone)
...please. That's all I'm askin'
you.
GINGER
(Into telephone)
Do you... I mean... I don't think
she should go by herself.
GINGER
(Into telephone,
holding back tears)
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do
you think if I came back... do you
think you could forgive me?
GINGER
(Into telephone)
I under-understand that. I-I know I
fucked up.
GINGER
(Into telephone)
...I-I... made some mistakes and I
spent some money.
ACE
(Over telephone)
What's it...
ACE
(Over telephone)
How serious?
GINGER
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
ACE
(Over telephone)
It's under...
ACE
(Over telephone)
...the rest of the two million is
still there?
GINGER
(Into telephone)
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
GINGER
(Into telephone)
Okay?
ACE
(Over telephone)
All right...
ACE sees GINGER and AMY coming off the Tangiers private jet.
GINGER wobbles a little as she comes down the ramp.
GINGER
(Waving brightly)
Hi, Sam.
ACE picks AMY up and hugs her, ignoring GINGER. They walk to
the car and drive off.
GINGER is furious. She picks up the suitcase and walks up to
her sportscar.
GINGER
Fucker!
(Sobs.)
She drives off.
A very large trailer is in the middle of an empty construction
site. GINGER's and NICKY's cars are parked outside.
NICKY (O.S.)
(From trailer)
Well, what are you supposed to do? I
mean, what do you want to do?
Do
you want to stay the way you are?
You want to stay like this?
You
can't do that.
NICKY opens the door to the trailer and peers out to make
sure no one is watching.
We see past a chain-link fence to a camper. We hear the sound
of photos being taken with a high-speed camera.
We see GINGER and NICKY slip out of the trailer in the
deserted work site.
FBI AGENT #1 (O.S.)
You see that?
FBI MEN with long-lens cameras are recording the event on
film.
FBI AGENT #1
That's Ace's wife.
Still photos: NICKY and GINGER steal a kiss.
FBI AGENT #1
Fantastic!
Still photos: Click. Click. GINGER and NICKY embrace.
The AGENTS watch as GINGER and NICKY move towards their
separate cars.
FBI AGENT #1
This is great for the boss.
GINGER gets into her car.
Still photos: Click: GINGER getting into her car. Click:
NICKY getting into his car.
NICKY and GINGER drive off.
A neon signs reads: LA CONCHA MOTEL.
ACE (V.O.)
...when she wanted to be.
WE SEE A CANTED ANGLE OF A ROOM AND BALCONY WITH DRAWN
CURTAINS.
ACE (V.O.)
And... this... this is how she backed
him off.
A car moves into the station and stops at a gas pump.
ACE (V.O.)
...time, Nicky had things so fucked
up on the streets, that every time
Marino went back home, the...
NICKY is punching a man who is leaning against a car. They
are surrounded by MARINO, FUSCO, BLUE and HARDY. The man
remains erect.
ACE (V.O.)
The booze, the coke, the broads... I
mean, he got sloppy.
He just wasn't
the same Nicky anymore.
DOMINICK takes over. Exhausted, NICKY walks to his car and
leans on the open car door.
MARINO
(To NICKY)
You must have drunk too much.
NICKY
Go fuck yourself.
ACE (V.O.)
I heard one night he had to belt a
guy three times before he finally
went down.
DOMINICK finally knocks the man down.
ACE (V.O.)
In the old days, Nicky would've decked
him with one shot.
NICKY and his crew get into their cars.
ACE (V.O.)
...to all of us. And his crew followed
him right over the edge.
The man is left alone on the ground of the dingy parking
lot.
ACE (V.O.)
They were all tuned up half the time
on coke. I mean, they started doin'...
BLUE gets out of his car with an aluminium foil package to
confront the police.
ACE (V.O.)
...stupid things.
COP #1
Watch it, partner, watch it!
ACE (V.O.)
The worst was Blue.
BLUE
(Belligerent)
Hey, what do you guys want out of my
life, huh?
COP #1
Police! Stay in the fuckin' car!
ACE (V.O.)
He never knew when to keep his fuckin'
mouth shut.
COP #2
He has a gun!
COP #1
Drop your gun or I'll -!
BLUE
Hey, fuck you!
COP #1
Drop the gun!
BLUE is shot several times by both COPS. He falls on the
ground, dead.
ACE (V.O.)
The cops shot him. They shot Blue...
FLASHBACK - A LITTLE EARLIER
BLUE is yelling back at the COPS, holding the foil package.
ACE (V.O.)
...because they thought his hero
sandwich was a gun!
Freeze frame as the camera moves in on the wrapped sandwich
in his hand.
ACE (V.O.)
You know, they could have...
The COPS walk up to BLUE, who is on the ground amid shattered
glass.
ACE (V.O.)
...been right, but who knows?
COP #1
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a
fuckin' hero sandwich here.
COP #2
What do you want? It - It's pitch-
black out here. It's tin foil.
COP #1
Pitch-black?! It -
COP #2
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
COP #1
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be
filling out paper work for the next
two months because of you and this
piece of shit, you...
COP #2
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm
sorry.
COP #1
...fuckin' jerk-off.
ACE (V.O.)
And to make matters worse, to get
even, Nicky's crew got stoned one
night and they started shootin' up
the cops' houses.
COP #1 plants a gun on the ground next to BLUE's legs using
a handkerchief to avoid leaving fingerprints.
The house explodes as gunfire riddles the front of a
detective's home. MARINO, DOMINICK, FUSCO, HARDY and three
HOODS in another car are spraying the home with machine-guns
and shotguns.
NICKY and MARINO emerge from the shop.
ACE (V.O.)
I mean, it got to the point where
they couldn't even talk in the Gold
Rush anymore because the Feds put a
wire in the wall.
DAY
Two FBI AGENTS with binoculars are watching NICKY and MARINO,
trying to read their lips.)
ACE (V.O.)
And even when they talked outside,
they had to cover their mouths
because...
LIP-READER
(Lowering his
binoculars)
Jeez, he's coverin' up again.
He raises the binoculars and looks through again.
ACE (V.O.)
...the Feds brought in lip-readers.
NICKY and MARINO are outside talking. They are covering their
mouths with their hands and constantly looking around.
ACE (V.O.)
Nicky found out about it from a teller
who owed him money.
This guy
worked...
Voice-over trails off.
MARINO
He asked me again about you and the
Jew's wife.
NICKY
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
MARINO
He asked me again about you and the
Jew's wife.
NICKY
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
MARINO
I told him I didn't know nothin'.
But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said
if you did anything, you're fucked
up.
NICKY
You think he's goin' home, makin' a
beef behind my back?
MARINO
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
NICKY
Yeah, what's to stop him?
MARINO
I know. I know.
NICKY
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd
never okay anything, you know?
MARINO
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
NICKY
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They
earn with the prick. I got a funny
feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin'
war or somethin'.
(Pause)
I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w-
You know, but you know what I want
you to do?
MARINO
What?
NICKY looks suspiciously at a man walking by them.
NICKY
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
MARINO
Oh, he ain't nobody.
NICKY
You know what I want you to do? Get
a couple of guys to dig a hole in
the desert, then let 'em show you
where it's at.
MARINO
Angelo and Buster.
NICKY
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
MARINO
They'll do it.
NICKY
And when I'm ready, I'll say the
words, 'Go see the Jew.'
MARINO
Yeah.
NICKY
And you make it disappear, you know
what I mean?
MARINO
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta
be ready. You know what I'm talkin'
about?
NICKY
Did I say to do anything yet? I said
I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I
want to think about it. Where're
these pricks at?
Looks for the FBI AGENTS.
MARINO
Don't know.
NICKY
Dominick said they're in the motel?
MARINO
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin'
bank. I don't know. They're all over
the joint.
GINGER's car screeches into the parking lot and she jumps
out, leaving her car oor open and engine running. A valet
parker approaches.
GINGER
(To VALET PARKER)
Leave it where it is.
MARINO throws GINGER out the back door. She falls on her
side, crying.
NICKY
Get the fuck out of here.
GINGER
(Sobbing, getting up)
I don't need you! I have my own
fuckin' money!
NICKY
All right, all right.
She stumbles to her car.
GINGER
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared
anymore!
NICKY
All right. Be careful.
GINGER
You fucked with me for the last time!
NICKY
Okay, yeah.
Through the sliding patio doors, we see ACE and SHERBERT
making sure all the doors are locked and the lights are turned
off.
ACE (V.O.)
I already left the kid with neighbors
and I had about a million in cash
and jewels that I gave to Sherbert
to lock up in the hotel.
ACE (O.S.)
(From following scene)
Put this in the...
A crisp, sunny morning. SHERBERT's car is parked on the street
in front of the house.
Camera pans with GINGER's car as it approaches the driveway
and crashes into the back of ACE's parked car.
GINGER repeatedly smashes into ACE's car.
GINGER
(From her car)
I mean it!
ACE emerges from the front door, taking cover behind a brick
column.
GINGER
You come down here right now! Come
down here and talk to me, goddamn
it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out
here!
I'm gonna drive this fucking
car through the living-room!
She starts to drive it across the lawn. ACE darts back towards
the front door. GINGER's car stops in front of the porch.
GINGER
(Getting out of the
car to confront ACE)
You fucking coward! You motherfucker!
She slips and falls on the lawn.
GINGER
You come out here and talk to me,
you fucker!
ACE
(From the porch)
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're
on drugs. You're gonna -
GINGER
I am not!
ACE
(Pointing to her)
You're gonna be sorry if you don't
stop that.
GINGER
Don't you threaten me!
ACE
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
GINGER
(Kicking the hedges)
Don't you threaten me!
A female neighbor walks out of her house. A man from the
house next door does the same. We see AMY watching from the
neighbor's window.
GINGER (O.S.)
You are not threatening me anymore!
ACE (O.S.)
I'm not -
GINGER is bending down, breaking off branches from some plants
and throwing them at ACE.
GINGER
You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you!
ACE flinches as a handful of leaves hits his face.
GINGER
I am fuckin' Nicky Santoro! I am!
He's my new sponsor!
ACE gestures towards the neighbors who are watching. A squad
car pulls into the driveway.
GINGER
(To ACE)
What about that, you fuckhead?!
(To neighbors.)
What are you looking at? Fuck off!
Two COPS walk up the driveway towards GINGER.
COP #1
Hey!
COP #2
Hey!
GINGER
(To neighbors)
Go back inside! This is none of your
business!
(To ACE.)
I don't have to take your shit all
the time anymore.
COP #1
Hey.
GINGER
I'll to the FBI!
COP #2
Mrs. Rothstein, hey.
GINGER
I will go to the police! I am not
(kicking hedge)
Protecting you anymore, you fuck!
COP #1
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
GINGER
He won't...
An FBI AGENT is parked down the block, photographing the
scene through a long-lens camera.
GINGER (O.S.)
...let me inside!
FREEZE FRAME: COP #1 TUGGING AT GINGER'S JACKET.
UNFREEZE: LIVE ACTION CONTINUES AS SHE PULLS AWAY FROM HIM.
COP #1
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry.
We've got some complaints about -
about the noise.
GINGER
I'm just trying to get in my house!
COP #1
I understand.
GINGER
He won't let me go in my house!
ACE
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy,
I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well,
I'm not gonna let her in, the way
she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
GINGER
Not gonna let me in?
ACE
Who knows what you're gonna do in
there? I don't want you -
GINGER
What do you mean, what am I gonna
do? I'm in the same clothes for two
days! I want to get a few of my
things! Big deal!
COP #1
All right. Okay, okay.
COP #2
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let
her in the house and get a few of
her things?
That way she'll get out
of here. This is half her house
anyway.
ACE
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
GINGER
Oh, you are...
ACE
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
GINGER
(Kicking, pulling up
plants and throwing
them at ACE)
Let me in the house! Fucker!
COP #1 holds her back.
GINGER
Fucker!
COP #1
Please.
ACE
Should I let her in like - ?
GINGER
You ought to be afraid, the way you
fuckin' treat me!
COP #1
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a
lot easier on everybody here if we
just let her in the house.
COP #2
If we let her get a few of her things
we'll be out of your hair.
ACE
If she calms down, I will let her in
the house.
GINGER
(Pants, yelling)
I am calm!
ACE
If she calms down...
COP #1
(To GINGER)
No, you're not calm.
ACE
...I will let her in the house for
five minutes if you gentlemen will
escort her out if she happens not to
want to leave. Because I don't - I -
GINGER
(To COP #1)
Can I go in?
COP #1
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
GINGER
Can I go in?
COP #1
Jeff, would you go in with her?
GINGER walks towards the front door.
COP #2
We can do that. Absolutely. Yes.
Absolutely.
GINGER
Yes, fine!
Fine!
(In ACE's face as she
brushes past him.)
Fuck you!
The FBI AGENT taking photographs.
We see a series of surveillance photos of GINGER, ACE and
the COPS on the front lawn.
AMY is watching her parents and the COPS across the street,
until the housekeeper pulls her away into the house.
GINGER (O.S.)
(From following scene)
You wouldn't believe how mean he's
been to me. He's locked up...
ACE and COP #1 are on the front porch talking.
ACE
(Smoking, checking
his watch)
Yeah, I don't want her in there more
than a few more minutes.
COP #1
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of
minutes. We got other things to do
too, you know. He'll hurry her up.
How's everything else besides this?
ACE
Fine, fine. How's your family?
COP #1
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my
wife's pregnant again.
ACE
Oh, good.
COP #1
Yeah.
ACE
Congratulations.
ACE shakes his hand.
COP #1
Thanks, yeah... I'm kind of happy
about this, you know.
ACE, COP #1 and several neighbors wait as GINGER storms out
with COP #2 carrying a small overnight bag.
GINGER
(To the COPS but
looking at ACE)
And it would be great if you guys
could follow me out of here, because
he's been threatening me.
GINGER walks to her car.
COP #2
(To COP #1)
Come on. I'm sorry.
COP #1
Okay.
ACE
(to COP #1, shaking
hands)
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
COP #1
All right, take care.
GINGER backs her car out, smashing into ACE's car once again.
SHERBERT watches from a small, curtained window.
GINGER drives down the street followed by the police car.
The FBI camper pulls out and follows the squad car following
GINGER.
GINGER is driving and crying.
GINGER
(To herself, panting)
I can't believe this.
(Sighs.)
GINGER swerves into the bank, parks in front of the main
entrance and gets out of her car. The COPS park behind her.
GINGER
(To COPS, rushing
inside)
I just need to pick up a little cash
inside.
Could you come with me?
Two more FBI AGENTS, with binoculars and a camera, photograph
GINGER as she walks into the bank.
ACE and SHERBERT get into ACE's damaged car. A metal strip
dangling from SHERBERT's door scrapes the pavement as they
pull out.
The FBI AGENTS photograph GINGER leaving the bank.
GINGER throws the canvas bag into the trunk of her car when,
suddenly, she sees ACE's beat-up Cadillac approaching. She
gasps.
GINGER
Oh, God. It's him.
(To COPS.)
You have to stop him. You have to -
'Cause he said he was going to kill
me.
ACE jumps out of his car and runs toward GINGER, SHERBERT
follows him out.
ACE is intercepted by the COPS who hold him back.
GINGER
You just - Just stop him.
COP #1
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where
you goin' -
ACE
Stop -
COP #1
Wait, hold on a second.
ACE
Hey!
COP #1
Hold on a second.
The COPS huddle around ACE and SHERBERT until GINGER's car
pulls out of the bank.
COP #1
Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin'
we can do. There's nothin' we can
do.
ACE, unable to pursue, watches GINGER speed away.
ACE
Look, look. You can't stop her for
speeding? I mean, look what the hell
she's doing.
COP #1
Speeding?
COP #2
We're talkin' to you right now.
GINGER's car disappears into traffic. The FBI car across the
street follows right behind her.
COP #2
There's nothing we can do. She had
the key.
COP #1
She's on the account. There's nothing
we can do.
The AGENTS are following GINGER.
FBI AGENT #1
Let's pull her over at that Citgo
Station.
FBI AGENT #2
(Driving)
Okay, let's do it.
FBI AGENT #1 puts a siren on top of the car's roof.
GINGER pulls over at a gas station, the FBI car with siren
blaring right behind her.
A powerless ACE and SHERBERT are still standing in front of
the bank with the COPS. COP #2 gives ACE a 'sorry' gesture.
GINGER and the FBI AGENTS are standing by her car. She is
distraught.
FBI AGENT #2
We're - we're placing you under arrest
for -
GINGER
(Sobbing)
For what?
FBI AGENT #2
We're placing you under arrest for
aiding and abetting -
GINGER
(Through tears)
What?
FBI AGENT #2
We're placing you under arrest for
aiding and abetting a -
GINGER
(Crying)
But I'm just trying to leave.
ACE (V.O.)
After all the threats and all the
bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't
tell 'em anything. But by then, the
Feds didn't need her, anyway.
GINGER
(Sobbing)
But it was just mine.
ACE (V.O.)
They had all the pieces they needed.
FBI AGENT #1
Come on.
GINGER
But I didn't do anything.
The AGENTS escort GINGER to their car.
ACE (V.O.)
And everybody...
Twelve FBI AGENTS with rifles, wearing 'FBI' armbands, charge
into the parking lot and rush through the front door.
ACE (V.O.)
...began to tumble.
FBI AGENT #3
FBI! We have a warrant!
ACE (V.O.)
...one after the other... just like
dominoes. Between Piscano complaining
on a wire.
The FBI AGENTS escort DOMINICK, HARDY, FUSCO and MARINO out
of the front of the shop.
ACE (V.O.)
Between Nicky, Ginger, me and my
license... paradise... we managed to
really fuck it all up.
ACE opens his front door and is confronted by two FBI AGENTS.
He is shown pictures of NICKY and GINGER at the construction
site.
ACE (V.O.)
(Quietly)
And at the end of the day, they
finally came to see me with the
pictures.
FBI AGENT #1
(Pointing to the
pictures)
Why protect a friend who betrayed
you like that?
ACE (V.O.)
But I didn't want to look at 'em. I
didn't want to look at the guys who
brought 'em either.
ACE refuses to look at the photos and quietly closes the
door on the AGENTS.
ANDY STONE and his LAWYER are walking toward their car.
STONE
You call Artie... and you tell him I
don't care what, he's gotta be in my
office Thursday morning before eleven
o'clock.
LAWYER
It's done.
His LAWYER veers to the left, walking away from STONE who
keeps talking.
LAWYER (O.S.)
It's done.
STONE
(To himself)
It's terribly important. I gotta
have a conversation with this guy.
That's all.
GAGGI's men, CURLY and BEEPER, appear from behind STONE and
shoot him dead.
They empty their silent half-load rounds into STONE even
after he's down on the snowy ground. They walk away
discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars.
NICKY (V.O.)
As much as they liked him, I mean,
he wasn't one of us. He wasn't
Italian. As far as they knew, he
could have talked. Otherwise, Stony
might still be alive.
MONTAGE OF MURDERS:
TITLE IN: COSTA RICA
The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish-
style house.
NICKY (V.O.)
The first one to skip was John Nance.
He found a nice, warm secluded place
in Costa Rica. He thought nobody
would find him there.
Several gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house
through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He
breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in.
BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into
the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from
yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the
stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen.
NICKY (V.O.)
But, then, his kid got nabbed by the
Feds for drugs, and so naturally the
bosses were afraid he'd come out of
hidin' just to save his kid and give
'em all up.
So...
CURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE
from behind.
CURLY
Hey, where you goin', jag-off?
NANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top
of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth
and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away.
NICKY (V.O.)
But anyway, they, you know, they all
had to follow.
A bound COUNT ROOM EXEC and a CLERK are kneeling next to a
large pit in the esert ground in front of BEEPER and CURLY.
NICKY (V.O.)
Everybody went down.
The CLERK groans as he's shot in the head by BEEPER. Blood
splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole.
COUNT ROOM EXEC
Go ahead, fuck...
CURLY
Fuck you.
CURLY shoots the EXEC in the head, he too falls backward
into the pit. The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies,
then toss their guns into the hole.
NICKY (V.O.)
Before you knew it...
RICHIE, a sharply dressed Tangiers EXEC, is getting into his
new Lincoln.
NICKY (V.O.)
...anybody who knew anything wound
up gettin' whacked.
CURLY sneaks up from behind and hits the EXEC with a lead
pipe. He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke
him to death. The EXEC struggles a bit but the bag soon fills
with blood. CURLY strikes him with the pipe one last time.
ACE emerges from the restaurant, smoking a cigarette as in
the first scene in the film. He gets into his car to start
the ignition.
ACE (V.O.)
No matter what the Feds or the papers
might have said about my car
bombing...
Flames surge from the windshield, concealing ACE behind the
wheel.
The sign above him reads: 'Tony Roma's a Place for Ribs'.
ACE is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car.
ACE (V.O.)
...it was amateur night, and you
could tell. Whoever it was, they put
the dynamite under the passenger
side. But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew,
was that that model car was made
with a metal plate under the driver's
seat. It's the only thing that saved
my life.
ACE opens his car door and gets in.
NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of a car on a farm road
for a meeting. FAT SALLY, a heavy-set wiseguy, is already
there.
FAT SALLY (O.S.)
Hey, Nicky.
ACE (V.O.)
And so did the power that be.
NICKY
Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia?
They shake hands.
FAT SALLY
How you doin'?
MARINO approaches NICKY from behind.
NICKY (V.O.)
It took months for...
NICKY's car drives up the farm road to meet his crew.
NICKY: (V.O.)
...everything to calm down, but
finally my guys got out on bail and
the bosses wanted me to send my
brother Dominick out to Vegas.
Always
the dollars, always the fuckin'...
NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of the car to greet FAT
SALLY. HARDY, FUSCO and BEEPER are also waiting there,
smiling.
NICKY (V.O.)
...dollars. I mean, it was still way
too hot for me to even go near Vegas,
so I set up a meeting with the guys
way out in the sticks. I didn't want
my brother to get fucked around.
NICKY shakes hands with SALLY. FUSCO walks up to say hello.
NICKY (V.O.)
I mean, what's right is right. They
don't give a fuck about - urgghh!
MARINO hits NICKY in the back with a bat. FAT SALLY grabs
him by the throat.
HARDY and BEEPER hold DOMINICK by the arms.
MARINO hits NICKY's legs with the bat.
FAT SALLY
Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat.
DOMINICK
Fuck!
You...
FUSCO and FAT SALLY pin NICKY down and hold his face straight
ahead, forcing him to watch his brother being beaten.
DOMINICK
(To MARINO)
...rat motherfucker! You rat mother-
MARINO hits DOMINICK in the shoulder with the bat.
MARINO
Tough guy! You and your f-
(he strikes DOMINICK's
chest)
Fuckin' brother!
DOMINICK
Oh, you - !
NICKY tries to look away.
MARINO
No more!
FAT SALLY
Get him, Marino!
MARINO
(Hitting DOMINICK
across the neck)
You fuckin' scumbag!
The wiseguys hold NICKY's face so he has to see his brother.
MARINO
(Lunging the bat into
DOMINICK's stomach)
No more.
He swings the bat across his head, knocking DOMINICK on the
ground.
NICKY
(Still pinned,
screaming)
Frankie!
MARINO
(Looking at NICKY as
he strikes DOMINICK)
No more! You see? Watch!
HARDY and BEEPER join MARINO. All three are beating DOMINICK
with baseball bats.
NICKY
(Held down by his
neck)
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
MARINO
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
The camera tilts down to DOMINICK's bloody face as the three
continue to beat him to death.
NICKY
Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of
shit!
NICKY tries to stand up but FAT SALLY and FUSCO keep him
down.
MARINO
No more fuckin' dirty work!
NICKY
(Rolling over on his
back in pain)
No, no, no, no!
MARINO
(To HARDY and BEEPER)
Take him out! Take this motherfucker
out!
They drag DOMINICK by his feet. MARINO swings at him with
two bats as he's taken away into the cornfield.
DOMINICK is battered and bloody. MARINO, HARDY and BEEPER
stand over him, still swinging their bats.
NICKY is on his side, still held down by SALLY and FUSCO.
His face is a little bloody.
NICKY
(Whimpering, as they
beat DOMINICK)
Dominick! Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.
Frankie.
(Pleading for his
brother's life.)
Frankie, leave the kid alone. He's
still breathin'. He's still breathin'.
Leave him alone. Frankie.
MARINO swings two final blows to DOMINICK's head. NICKY looks
away, sobbing.
MARINO
All right. Strip him.
MARINO and his hoods remove DOMINICK's pants and shirt.
NICKY
(Sobbing as they
undress his brother)
No balls, you got no fuckin' balls.
Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.
NICKY sobs. They drag DOMINICK toward a freshly dug grave
and toss his limp, barely conscious body into it.
NICKY
(Crying quietly)
Dominick.
Dominick.
(Sobs.)
Dominick.
NICKY looks up to MARINO. They share a look before MARINO
swings his bat, striking NICKY's head.
FREEZE FRAME ON MARINO.
UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES.
MARINO and his men start beating NICKY, who groans and spits
blood as he is struck.
NICKY is stripped down to his underwear. HARDY and FUSCO
drag him to the grave and dump him over DOMINICK.
MARINO
Come on, come on. Bury 'em.
MARINO and BEEPER look on as the other hoods begin the tedious
work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel,
until they are covered up to their necks.
We see NICKY's face, bloodied and battered. He's still
breathing and groaning.
ACE (V.O.)
The word was out. The bosses had had
enough of Nicky. They had enough.
How much were they gonna take? So,
they made an example of him and his
brother. They buried them while they
were still breathing.
A full shovel of dirt lands upon NICKY's face and chest with
a thud.
ACE is being wheeled to an ambulance on a stretcher. There
are firemen and policemen in the background.
AMBULANCE DRIVER
(As ACE is wheeled
into the rear of the
ambulance)
You sure are lucky, mister.
ACE's face disappears into the ambulance.
ACE's car explodes.
Music in: J. S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'.
The casino is being leveled - actuality footage.
The brand-new 5,000-room hotel with its entrance shaped like
the MGM lion's head.
ACE (V.O.)
The town will never be the same.
After the...
The hotel and casino implodes, filling the screen with fire
and smoke.
ACE (V.O.)
...Tangiers, the big corporations
took it all over. Today it looks
like...
The casino is destroyed floor by floor by explosions.
ACE (V.O.)
...on the poker slots.
Another 5,000 room hotel built like an Arthurian castle.
ACE (V.O.)
In the old days, dealers knew your
name, what you drank, what you played.
Today, it's like checkin' into an
airport. And if you order room
service, you're lucky if you get it
by Thursday.
The casino marquee topples to the ground in flames.
ACE (V.O.)
Today, it's all gone. You get a whale
show up with four million in a...
The casino collapses into smoke and dust.
ACE (V.O.)
After the Teamsters got...
A 4,000 room hotel with a 60-foot volcano out front. Tourists
watch it belch smoke and flames.
ACE (V.O.)
...knocked out of the box, the
corporations tore down practically
every one of the old casinos. And
where did the money come from...
A giant glass pyramid 30 stories high with a huge sphinx
outside.
ACE (V.O.)
...to rebuild the pyramids?... Junk
bonds.
TITLE IN: SAN DIEGO
A house very much like ACE's house in Vegas, including the
fact that it backs up on a golf course. We see ACE inside
talking on the phone with a bookie.
ACE
(Into telephone)
Still not sure?
